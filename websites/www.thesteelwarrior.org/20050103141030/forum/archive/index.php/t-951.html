<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Barraind</div><div class="date">06-02-2003, 12:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The quotes I use are from the eleventy billion threads on this board. I have argued the same on Paladins of Norrath with Frodlin and Golatius on many occasions.  Not all of this relates to itself, I am simply answering the questios/comments as they come up int he threads, which means it might get repetitive. All answers are based on the general theories of groups, which are explained at the bottom.<br />
<br />
For the readers digest version, skip down a ways to the summary.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mentioned this in the big Warriors in POP thread but thought it might be worth airing in it's own thread.<br />
<br />
I'd like to get peoples opinions on this. It might be considered controversial and it certainly runs against all conventional logic <br />
<br />
So anyway. It's often mentioned how Knights have been upgraded over time such that their Hp and mitigation abilities aren't terribly much worse than a warriors, that coupled with their enhanced spell selection and various AA's and other utility skills makes them far more viable classes for grouping than they were in the Kunark Dark Ages.<br />
<br />
Given this, is it still true to say that they are entirely dependant on their aggro generating ability in order to be considered for the tank spot in a group?<br />
<br />
If knights were to loose their aggro advantage, how badly impacted would their ability to find a group be?<br />
<br />
This isn't an insidious plot to get knights nerfed I'm just curious as to what others think about this - warriors, and indeed any knight visitors to this board. <br />
<br />
Thoughts please....<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Without our aggro generating spells, we are a warrior with less hp, less ac, worse atk, lower defensive caps, no AT bandaids, a lower taunt cap, fewer EB Bandaids (and be honest, how many knights have a rz 2hander?).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Summary: due to the pal mana pool, there simply isn't any warrior HP advantage, and any disparity in DPS is probably made up by the superiour selection of weapons available <br />
<br />
Our mana pool is normally sapent holding aggro, not healing. On the offchance the only other class that can heal us in the group is a druid, we can use supernal cleansing. If a cleric or shaman is in the group, or heal over times dont hold and our quick heal (light of nife) is horribly pathetic in hp/mana ratio.<br />
<br />
Knights  have access to... 0 weapons better then warriors, unless I am missing something. Blade of war - War, Pal, Sk. SEWS - War, Pal, Sk. Rathe 2hb - War, Pal, Sk. Time 2hb from Terris - War, Pal, Sk.  Even Luclin era: BBB - War, Pal, SK. Emp Sword - War, Pal, Sk. Only 2hander war is not on is goldenrod, and any of the above weapons, half of which the force that can kill cursed can get, do.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If the agro advantage of SHD/PAL was eliminated, you will effectively kill the class, especially for XP groups.<br />
<br />
Right, so you would have everyone believe. I don't agree. The Knight aggro advantage prior to PoP was of minor significance, and Knights were tanking fine and were getting groups.<br />
<br />
If we have no aggro advantage, see above. We are useless at that point in groups. Being able to cast Wave of Marr will do nothing if we mitigate less, taunt worse (hi taunt cap + better selection of eb + at + better dps means you taunt better if we dont have the stun thing), and have generally 750-1k hp and 200-300 ac less then warriors.  Why would a group want me at this point?  Raids, we still have group heals, but good luck with offtanking things that NEED to be taken care of, which is currently what our spells let us do. <br />
<br />
<br />
And you admit that in Luclin that changed, people began to recognize a Paladin's ability to tank. And godlike aggro generation wasn't the primary reason, was it? It was that they could in fact tank. PoP and LoY has improved their tanking ability even further by giving them additional spells, fast heals, and fast mana cheap stuns. They're quite capable of assisting with their own healing or helping to heal the group/others. Add to this they do have other utility they can use while tanking. Warriors do not. Granted all this additional ability requires mana, but that is much less of a handicap than ever before.<br />
<br />
So with all this on the table you would also argue that it is required that Paladins maintain a huge aggro control advantage over Warriors just to stay competative? Otherwise no one will ever use a Paladin tank again? Sorry, no sale. I don't buy it. I believe you believe it, but I don't. Paladins have come too far and are too effective for that. It makes no sense to me that Warriors must be at a pronounced disadvantage in order for Paladins to be competative. There must be a middle ground, if you're just willing to accept the possibility. <br />
<br />
Thats exactly the truth. We can only tank decently because we can hold the mob on us. My 8100+ hp means nothing if the mob wont touch me. If i did not have the aggro control, the mob wouldnt, and as much of a problem as you claim to have getting aggro now, it would be worse for me, because again, i have less atk, less bandaids.  We were always able to hold aggro, but, until luclin, we lacked the itemization to full our designed role: tanking.  Even chain stunning now, it is possible for a rogue, wizard topull aggro if they wanted to. Imagine that whth worse taunt then you~<br />
<br />
<br />
This statement fascinates me, because it's one of the more common knight concerns. I'm perplexed because quite possibly the other most common knight statement I see is this:<br />
<br />
&quot;Knights have always had an aggro advantage over warriors from day 1&quot;<br />
<br />
So here I sit totally perplexed about what exactly was the issue in Kunark/Early Velious then?<br />
<br />
Our problems during this time - Hybrid exp penalty, exp penalty imposed on groups, lack of itemization until mid-late velious, knight only items being multiple times worse then warior items of the same kind (compare top kunark/early velious gear on a paladin and that on a warrior). These were the main problems.<br />
<br />
<br />
3. Pallys bring rez ability, buff ability, group heals, heals, LoH, Crowd control via root parking and a few others. You should know that by now? you are a pally aren't you? So your DPS is not great - you think average warriors put out a lot of DPS? groups dont take pallys, warriors and SKs for the DPS we put out, they take us to tank. simple. [quote]<br />
<br />
Number of times any of those get paladin groups - 0<br />
<br />
why?<br />
<br />
Res - Exp groups are designed to not die. If you dont die, res is meaningless. If you do die, you can get a res from a guildmate/friend in 2 hours 55 minutess anyway, with graveyards, your corpse, fully looted except the piece of bread you put there to hold your corpse, or mod rod, or mage epic, ect.<br />
<br />
Buff ability - Yeah, Hero is some good. Wait, no, i only cast it when a shaman is my only healer, and at that point, it is meaningless, because HP is not a factor when dealing with a shaman, as long as you can survive 1 round of melee from the mob.  Brells? Uh, that wont get us a group, sorry.<br />
<br />
Group Heals - Could possibly get you a group in trial of fire i guess, but what do you want to fight in exp groups that will be ae'ing? Uh... nothing, right.<br />
<br />
Heals - Hi, I tank. My heals mean 2 things, jack and shit. The likelyhood of a paladin getting a group for his healing skill is like a warrior getting one as the slower.<br />
<br />
LoH - Err, this is my version of defensive, except its worse, is 9 times slower on reuse, doesnt always work, isnt always even a decent sized heal, and can still magically just not work (and still remain unusable for 72min).<br />
<br />
Root parking - Hi, I tank. You ever try to tank and root park another mob? This is the job the wizard, shaman, druid, ranger, cleric, chanter, bard, necro, and every other class that isnt tanking the mob add to the group.  The day i get invited to a group to root, is the day i sleep naked in the arctic.<br />
<br />
Hey, its true i can do all those things... It still doesnt make me get a group spot for anything else but tanking. A wise choice, because any of those things i can do, a cleric/druid/shaman does multiple times better.<br />
<br />
My dps isnt great... but yours is better.<br />
<br />
<br />
[quote]4. Raids - You ever been on high end raids recently? Dont you realise how useful pallys are? Most encounters these days, whether Ntov, luclin or pop have some form of AoE. Clerics are busy healing the MT, so guess whose the only one left for group heal purposes? Pallys also make good rampage tanks. <br />
<br />
Raids - I heal the group and the clerics. I do not rampage tank any mob in the elemental planes. I do not want to rampage tank any mob in the elemental planes. With the exception of a couple, I am unable to rampage tank any mob in the elemental planes. I am sure tanking ramp 1200+ isnt impossible for you, but it largely is for me.  This is a situation where your extra hp + discs can save you. Explain how LoH does anything when i am getting ramp'd for more in 1 combat round then it heals. (assuming non crit, cause i donthave ch loh). We make pathetic rampage tanks at the upper levels of the game. <br />
<br />
<br />
But Knights do, Knights have every single HP increasing AA Ability that Warriors (or other melees do for that matter). This is a huge part of this issue.... the HP advantage (and AC) that warriors once had is now a MYTH... mudflation has decreased it to a point of absurdity. Warriors are the red headed step children of SoE/VI... always have been. Most of us feel that we have been nerfed by exclusion.<br />
<br />
Show me the top knight in any guild with equal of greater hp to the top warrior in the same guild. You cannot, it is impossible. Until the point when you are farming time for the eleventy billionth time, it will be impossible. You have an hp advantage in the gearing up for XYZ stage of the game, the Farming XYZ stage of the game, and the theres nothing left to do but farm XYZ stage of the game.  There was no paladin with equivalent hp at the end of luclin, and there will not be at the end of PoP. <br />
<br />
<br />
and yet paladins want to pretend their ability to rez doesnt matter... <br />
<br />
<br />
It doesnt, and its absurd to think it does.  As a tank, res means nothing. if i need it, its because i died. I have had to res someone in a group i was in... 3 timrs since pop, all 3 times it was myself.  I res more soloers in fire on a given night, because i am usually the last paladin/cleric to log for the evening, as i am a night owl college student.<br />
<br />
<br />
However, paladins are coming in here and saying, like I knew they would, that they bring nothing other than agro control and it would kill them. I call BS on that. Paladins will always downplay their abilities because they either are naive, or they KNOW they have it better than the other tank classes and don't want to be nerfed, or they're suffering from IDGStm (I-Deserve-to-be-God Syndrome). Pallys have been incredibly upgraded since Kunark era, even since SoL era with PoP and LoY. They are NOT the same as back then.<br />
<br />
90% pally rezzes have so little difference from 96% cleric rezzes. It's 6% of the experience you lost in the death...that comes out to about 1% exp...you can get that back in one kill. I play a cleric with an epic, I know the difference, it's not much. Any paladin who downplays their own rez as worthless compared to a cleric's rez is a lying scumbag.<br />
<br />
Group heals can't be nerfed, the agro comes from heal agro, which SOE only makes worse, not better. They also have the fastest heal in the game, Light of Nife, which is 1 second cast time for 850hp (which can be improved with AA). This is in addition to their LoH and group LoH-type ability from AA. Any paladin who downplays these abilities is tryig to keep them from getting noticed. <br />
<br />
<br />
We bring NOTHING besides tanking to a group. Our heals are meaningless in the context of an exp group. If we are tanking, it is rare we will cast these. If we are NOT tanking, we are a wasted group slot.  In what zone you can get exp from, would you trade having one of the lowest dps classes (all other melee classes, even bards do more, as bards dps is measured both from them and the effect of their songs, as well as shaman, druids, and every int caster, unless the enchanter cannot charm)for the ability to group heal (where only your tank should be getting hit), root (when you should be splitting/mezing), heal (when it is incredibly mana inneficient) and res (when the point of an exp group is to never have to do it)?<br />
<br />
There is not a single zone you would want that.  I must be a lying scumbag, because my res is worthless to me. If I ever have to use it, we are in a zone/area where we should not be, therefore we never should have been there, so i should have never had to use it in the first place.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure how loh, on a 72min reuse brings anything to a group, nor does our aa group heal, which is max 1250. If you dont understand it by now, an exp group is designed so 1 member, usually paladin, sk or warrior, takes ALL the damage, and gets healed with CH, druid CH, or shaman heals, while the rest of the group kills the mob. Its not, everyone gets hit so the paladins group useless aa skill has a use.  Wow, i can heal when the cleric darbs. oh wait, they cast EE already, never mind.<br />
<br />
<br />
Due to Paladin's much higher utility, I believe agro wise, power should go more towards: SK &gt; Pal &gt; Warrior...SKs are designed BY SOE to have better agro control than any class. Paladins shouldn't have as powerful agro control, they simply aren't designed to do so. In the words of the developers:<br />
<br />
Utility means nothing if you never have a situation where it is usefull. Show me a situation where you want my utility, and i will show you a group that should not be where they currently are. And, by the way, that group is most likely not getting anywhere near the exp they should.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
To answer your question from the first post...It would nearly kill SKs, but Paladins wouldn't be as hurt, as long as they're not an idiot and play their paladin as just a warrior with stuns. They're more powerful than they'd like you to believe, these last two expansions made sure of that.<br />
<br />
For the upteenth trillion time, we get groups for one reason: to make the mob hit us until it dies. Our abilities outside of stun and the occasional wave of marr when the cleric gets bored and messes with darb, are useless if we are doing our jobs right. <br />
<br />
We want you to believe our abilities arent all that, becaue they arent. You NEVER want your tank to be doing anything other then tanking, and in our case, wave of marr/prexus. It would kill us, trust me and every other paladin who says the same thing. Or for fun, take a level 65 paladin and never cast anything that can get snap aggro that warriors do not have. Notice how it is much harder for us then it is for warriors. All the utility in the world wont help if the mob wont hit us.<br />
<br />
<br />
So sorry, the attempt to down play the Paladin ability to heal just doesn't fly. Maybe you don't use your heals to advantage when tanking, but I've seen many a Paladin who does. And it makes them incrediably durable.<br />
<br />
The only times heals come into play is if something goes wrong. If something goes wrong, you could be screwed no matter what class you are. I would sort of pick a guaranteed riposte the mob for all but 1 seconds of a ch cast over pray the 850 i heal will save me (mobs can do more then that in 1 round).  So what if you cant reuse your disk for so many minutes? If you have &quot;mistakes&quot; that often, something is wrong.  My loh vs your 9 defensives/evasives isnt even a close contest either.  Both have the &quot;emergency use only&quot; tag, but the fact that mine is an instand 3300ish heal while yours lasts 3 minutes and will be worh well more then mine makes it a no brainer. <br />
<br />
<br />
You then show that, in a perfect world, with no lag, no distractions, the ideal mix of classes available, a paladins buffs and heals won't help. If your heals and buffs are so useless, would you give them up? Some how I doubt it.<br />
<br />
Clerics in my guild can ch me on most mobs without running out of mana or needing me to heal. Shaman and most druids can as well. Seeing as how i group 99% with guild and the other 1% with other competent, well equipped players, my heals tend to add... nothing. Not because I play my class wrong, but because the key to exp is getting the machine going. The tanks part in the machine is getting and holding aggro, not healing himself.<br />
<br />
<br />
So, lag never happens? The clerics phone never rings? The clerics baby never cries? The cleric never gets a string of fizzles? You never get adds and have more than one person taking damage? All those things can make for more than one instance of a late heal in an hour, and do not mean a crappy cleric. <br />
<br />
The cleric compensates for lag, the cleric tells you not to pull if they cant heal, if the 5 sec on 5 fizzles (and you are hardpressed to ever find them fail more then once), will kill you, the cleric sucks. You never get adds, because you kno when and where adds are due, and your puller knows how to pull. THAT is what exp grouping is. Not this random hackslash kill random things method you apparently do. <br />
<br />
<br />
1.) HP's there is no good explanation why warriors went from being the undisputed king of hps to barely better than the next. Warriors should get a premium on HP's on every item and spell. a simple 15% or 20% bonus would be sufficient. some may say this is too much, but back pre-POP when warriors had 6-7k hp and knight had 4-5k we had a 20% advantage, now it is almost negligeable.<br />
<br />
This was during the times when... amazingly... we couldnt buy our ways into groups most of the time. I, for one, will not repeat the fun of being lfg for 6 hours while warriors 7 levels lower (who have more hp/ac cause of itemization) get groups.<br />
<br />
<br />
2.) AC mitigation. Give us a consistent amount of noticeable mitigation. If a mob hits another plate class, say Paladin for 2000 it should only hit us for 1600. A Leather or silk should be hit for 2400 or so. the concept that all armor classes take same max damage is to me silly.<br />
<br />
So it seems silly that the max hit of a mob is the same no matter what you wear (if a car hits you, it cant make you anything more then dead) but its not silly that 2 classes wearing the same protection (where the difference in ac being the bigger number next to AC: you currently already have) take the same damage. <br />
<br />
<br />
Procs... Now I am not one without, I have BoC, Epic, and JSoFF. But needing to rely on a proc puts us at such a disadvantage over other classes. Look at the Pally bracer, free mana stun, intant aggro cast 6.0 refresh instant. <br />
<br />
Once you reach level 9, the Deepwater bracer is useless. It was only ever used to pull, anyone who would chain cast it in combat  needs to have his head examined.<br />
<br />
<br />
can actually claim with a straight face this is balanced?<br />
<br />
There is an easy fix to this problem, and it is: remove all agro from all knight spells, leaving them with the same tools to get agro that warriors have. <br />
<br />
So you would give us AT, increased skill caps, increased taunt caps, dual wield? Cause without aggro on spells, we DONT have the tools you do.<br />
<br />
<br />
To give another example on how powerful pally stuns are: Pulled a mob in PoV. I proced 3 times in about 5 seconds with my BoC. Thats well over 2000 hate points. I told the pally in our group to stun in order to see its effect. He stunned once and snapped agro from me. Is that just crazy or what. 150 mana &gt; BoC procing 3 times. I hear they are signing up stable boys for paladin's. I'm getting in line.... <br />
<br />
I dont believe this for a second, namely because mes + tash takes in the neithborhood of 2-4 stuns to get aggro over, and i know thats less hate then 3 procs of eb.<br />
<br />
<br />
One angle i thing they could take its similar to what they did with monks. Monks are damage dealers , and even a NAKED monk can hand out a good deal of damage (haha punny) . I think even very average warriors should be better tanks then well equiped pal/sk , just as average monks/rogues still outdamage warriors. <br />
<br />
You really thing average monks and rogues can outdamage well equipped warriors? I would think again. If an &quot;average&quot; warrior tanked better then a well equipped knight, the knight has 0 usefullness to a group. None what so ever.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The General Assumptions <br />
<br />
1 - There are 4 set roles for a group. Tank, Healing, Slow, DPS. There is no &quot;utility&quot;, as unless you are going to solro, you dont need &quot;utility&quot; (evcas) in PoP.<br />
<br />
2 -  3 Classes fit the tank role and no other role. These are Warrior, Paladin, Shadowknight.<br />
<br />
3 - A warrior will always have more HP/AC then a knight at the same level. This does not mean game level.<br />
<br />
4. A knight will have better Taunt abilitied then a warrior of the similar level.<br />
<br />
5. A warrior will have a mitigation and dps advantage over a knight of the same level. This holds true less in mid velious and early luclin, but corrects itself in late Luclin/PoP.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now...<br />
<br />
<br />
Paladins have a wide variety of spells in our books. Lets examine them a little closer.<br />
<br />
Buffs - Brells stacks with each healing class.  Aura o the crusader does not stack with druids. Hero does not stack with clerics or druids.  Symbol does not stack with clerics.<br />
<br />
The problem with saying that we will have so much more hp when grouped with a shaman is the heal threshold. Once you reach a point where the healer can have a net gain or no net loss of mana on heals, you win. Shaman hit this point more rapidly then any other caster, and in most zones, can holt it as long as needed without external buffs.  Basically, once you hit 4500 - 5k hp, a shaman can keep you alive forever. <br />
<br />
<br />
Roots - Never used. Nt worth the potential problems it can cause, and if you have a healer, they haveroots as well. Group with a wizard/necro, and they have better. Group with a chanter, and they have better, or most likely will mezs it.<br />
<br />
Lull/pacify/whatever - Useless. Coll huh?<br />
<br />
Heals - Good in a pinch, group heal is great for aggro and to save the group if needed. In an exp group, you shouldnt need to, if you do, theres something wrong (or you are doing poj trials)<br />
<br />
DA - if you need this... theres really trouble.<br />
<br />
Stuns - U dont like having to rely on cease as a 2nd stun to akilae. I have to however, as every other stun either takes too long to cast and/or pushes the mob. When tanking, you do not want to be shooting the mob all around.  Is it a mistake that stuns draw aggro? No. Stuns should piss the mob off. If you were trying to beat on someone and he could make you just stand there for a few seconds unable to hit him, or interrupt your spells, you wouldnt like him either (this is mob ai)<br />
<br />
<br />
Without our stuns, there is no reason to invite us to a group. 3 classes can heal better, and we will be a joke of a tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frodlin7th</div><div class="date">06-02-2003, 01:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aside from your premise being that we want identical aggro control, or yours completely gone being totally gone, and making your arguments sort of moot, there's one thing I'd like to comment on specifically after a general response to your interesting claims.<br />
<br />
Let me ask a few questions:<br />
<br />
1. Do you load up your group heal when you're in an experience group with a cleric?   <br />
<br />
2. Do you ever cast that group heal after Divine Arbitration?<br />
<br />
3. If you do, then you have utility that a warrior doesn't, do you not?<br />
<br />
4. If a warrior who wasn't as well equipped as you are took your place in an experience group (let's say you two had similar HP/AC, indicating you being at VT level gear, and he being at say post-NToV level), would the group notice the difference that your spells made?  <br />
<br />
5. This same warrior... what justifies HIS existence as a tank?<br />
<br />
6. You say that you are defined as tanks, and that without tanking, you are worthless, and that is therefore somehow why you should have extra consideration in terms of special abilities.   Is a warrior not defined solely as a tank?   Why is your claim to needing somethign special somehow different than his or hers?<br />
<br />
7. You listed some of the &quot;best of the best&quot; weapons and indicated that because of this, warrior and knight weaponry is &quot;balanced&quot;.   Do you claim that itemization is equal in the steps leading to the point of BoW, Emp Sword, or BBB?   <br />
<br />
8. Is it fair that a warrior has to wait until the &quot;end&quot; to acquire weaponry that is identical with knight acquirable weaponry, whiel the knight gets a path that is a ste-by-step upgrade path?<br />
<br />
9. Is it fair that a warrior should have to share &quot;end game&quot; weaponry with you, when they rely solely and exclusively upon their weaponry and armor to fill their role, while you rely on a triad of weaponry, armor and spells?<br />
<br />
10. If you have so many spells that suck so bad, why do you memorize them, and with the ability to delete spells, why are they still in your spellbook?<br />
<br />
11.  You talk about a massive hitpoint/ac difference between warriors and knights and how it's not possible for knights to exceed warriors when in equivalent armor.   Do you believe this to be a problem?   Does it anger you?<br />
<br />
12. Don't you mean to add the &quot;When a Paladin and a warrior are grouped with a cleric as primary healer&quot; disclaimer to your claim about never having equial or greater hitpoints than a warrior?   You do realize that in an experience group with a druid, your hitpoints and AC are roughly equal to a warrior's, and when grouped with a shaman as primary healer (which happens quite often as shamans are quite a good duoing class), that you actually EXCEED in EVERY case the hitpoints AND armor class of the warrior in IDENTICAL equipment?<br />
<br />
12. Is it right that there should *EVER* be a time that you have GREATER hitpoints and AC as an identically equipped warrior?   If so, please expound on this?  I'd like your rationale.<br />
<br />
The only times heals come into play is if something goes wrong. If something goes wrong, you could be screwed no matter what class you are. I would sort of pick a guaranteed riposte the mob for all but 1 seconds of a ch cast over pray the 850 i heal will save me (mobs can do more then that in 1 round). So what if you cant reuse your disk for so many minutes? If you have &quot;mistakes&quot; that often, something is wrong. My loh vs your 9 defensives/evasives isnt even a close contest either. Both have the &quot;emergency use only&quot; tag, but the fact that mine is an instand 3300ish heal while yours lasts 3 minutes and will be worh well more then mine makes it a no brainer. <br />
<br />
/disc furious and /disc fortitude are the *only* two &quot;emergency&quot; discs that we have.    Both have very long refreshes and very short durations.   You cannot honestly, and with a straight face compare LoH with /disc defensive because they're use in two completely different circumstances... if I'm berserk and know that a CH isn't going to land, I do NOT pop /disc defensive, EVER.   It's going to be furious or fortitude (and it's never fortitude, I've used that one time ever, and it was a waste because I got stunned still and killed after it wore, and therefore never used it again).<br />
<br />
The only valid comparisons are the following:<br />
<br />
/disc furious or /disc fellstrike vs. LoH or Divine Aura  <br />
<br />
It's true that Divine Aura has a cast time, fizzle rate, and can be interrupted, but be realistic, you have about 3-4 seconds knowing that you're losing HP faster than a CH is going to go off...  You can attempt to DA until right before the heal lands and click it off as it does, you've lost aggro for a split second, but will get it back immediately regardless as soon as it's clicked off.   Other than that, you can [TAB]/Hotkey/[TAB] with LoH which serves an almost identical purpose as /disc furious, it prevents catastrophe.  Now, you yourself said that if this happens more than once every 72ish minutes then there's a problem with your group, where is the inherent bonus to the warrior?</div></div><hr />

Warriors crush any other classes at rampage tanking since it has nothing to do with how much aggro you can pull.  Heck you can even use a shield while RTing (and probably should).  The disc sure don't hurt either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wilhelmm_Lanys</div><div class="date">06-02-2003, 02:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Moderators, I wish to push for a proper re-naming of this thread. Instead let's label it properly:<br />
&quot;Paladins, the myth replaced by a slightly more twisted myth&quot;<br />
<br />
So, let's begin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Our mana pool is normally sapent holding aggro, not healing. On the offchance the only other class that can heal us in the group is a druid, we can use supernal cleansing. If a cleric or shaman is in the group, or heal over times dont hold and our quick heal (light of nife) is horribly pathetic in hp/mana ratio.&quot;<br />
<br />
See, this is funny. Funny considering that hybrids, paladins and shadowknights alike, seem to be coming here with different ideas on this whole matter. Some are saying &quot;agro generation takes too much mana&quot; while others state that their agro spells cost virtually no mana. According to certain paladins, their most basic stun yields enoguh agro so sustain them. I somehow doubt such a low-level spell requires too much mana.<br />
<br />
&quot;Knights have access to... 0 weapons better then warriors, unless I am missing something. Blade of war - War, Pal, Sk. SEWS - War, Pal, Sk. Rathe 2hb - War, Pal, Sk. Time 2hb from Terris - War, Pal, Sk. Even Luclin era: BBB - War, Pal, SK. Emp Sword - War, Pal, Sk. Only 2hander war is not on is goldenrod, and any of the above weapons, half of which the force that can kill cursed can get, do.&quot;<br />
<br />
I'm sorry, do you play Everquest? Seriously, you have GOT to be kidding me if you're gonna actually argue this. <br />
<br />
1) Ssra has 7. That's right, 7 hybrid-only 2-handers. If need be, I'll get a complete list for you later, but if you take a look at the loot tables from XTC, AL, and Cursed, and maybe 2 other mobs you'll see what I mean. Blade of the Angels, Mournflow, Blindfoe, Goldenrod, Sword of Lost Crusades are just two that come to mind. <br />
2) There are hybrid-only 2 handers of AD, and Resplendent War Maul, some PoP ones. Hell, even Tunare has a hybrid-only 2-hander. What was that about Knight itemization? Right, this argument holds absolutely 0 water, knights have benefitted from itemization as much as, if not more than virtually every other class since NToV.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thats exactly the truth. We can only tank decently because we can hold the mob on us. My 8100+ hp means nothing if the mob wont touch me. If i did not have the aggro control, the mob wouldnt, and as much of a problem as you claim to have getting aggro now, it would be worse for me, because again, i have less atk, less bandaids. We were always able to hold aggro, but, until luclin, we lacked the itemization to full our designed role: tanking. Even chain stunning now, it is possible for a rogue, wizard topull aggro if they wanted to. Imagine that whth worse taunt then you~&quot;<br />
<br />
http://steelwarrior.xwarzone.com/showthread.php?threadid=943<br />
<br />
Read. Most warriors don't want the ridiculously over-powered agro abilities of knights, and especially paladins since at least thats what SK's were designed for. Don't come here playing the pussy drama card over a couple of posts that don't represent the majority concensus.<br />
<br />
&quot;We bring NOTHING besides tanking to a group. Our heals are meaningless in the context of an exp group. If we are tanking, it is rare we will cast these. If we are NOT tanking, we are a wasted group slot. In what zone you can get exp from, would you trade having one of the lowest dps classes (all other melee classes, even bards do more, as bards dps is measured both from them and the effect of their songs, as well as shaman, druids, and every int caster, unless the enchanter cannot charm)for the ability to group heal (where only your tank should be getting hit), root (when you should be splitting/mezing), heal (when it is incredibly mana inneficient) and res (when the point of an exp group is to never have to do it)?<br />
<br />
There is not a single zone you would want that. I must be a lying scumbag, because my res is worthless to me. If I ever have to use it, we are in a zone/area where we should not be, therefore we never should have been there, so i should have never had to use it in the first place.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure how loh, on a 72min reuse brings anything to a group, nor does our aa group heal, which is max 1250. If you dont understand it by now, an exp group is designed so 1 member, usually paladin, sk or warrior, takes ALL the damage, and gets healed with CH, druid CH, or shaman heals, while the rest of the group kills the mob. Its not, everyone gets hit so the paladins group useless aa skill has a use. Wow, i can heal when the cleric darbs. oh wait, they cast EE already, never mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
Right. As opposed to the multiple array of skills that come with a warrior yes? You can scream that all your non-agro spells are utterly useless, but you damn well know that if these spells were removed, you and every other hybrid that finds them &quot;useless&quot; would be wailing in outrage until the sun goes down.<br />
<br />
Your LoH and heals bring to a group the same thing a warrior's edge in avoidance skills and /disc defensive, and even HP for the most part. If you get chealed for 6k every time, does it matter if you have 7k or 9khp buffed? If you're getting healed with 2-3,000 HP left 99% of the time, does the 3% edge in avoidance skills that warriors have really matter? No, the extra HP, the caps, and /disc defensive are the SoS, the emergency attributes that matter when a problem arizes. If that problem never comes, they don't matter. Quite similar to LoH, and your quick heals wouldn't you say? I certainly think so<br />
<br />
&quot;Utility means nothing if you never have a situation where it is usefull. Show me a situation where you want my utility, and i will show you a group that should not be where they currently are. And, by the way, that group is most likely not getting anywhere near the exp they should.&quot;<br />
<br />
See above. neither do the better skill caps or more HP/AC or /disc that we have. And the DPS issue is null simply because the vastly superior agro abilities of paladins allows hgiher damage classes, rogues, wizards, mages and the like to use their abilities more freely, with less concern about constantly getting agro. So, tell you what, you show me an XP scenario where our minute advantages really become important, and I'll show you one where your heals, buffs, and LoH are as well. <br />
<br />
&quot;For the upteenth trillion time, we get groups for one reason: to make the mob hit us until it dies. Our abilities outside of stun and the occasional wave of marr when the cleric gets bored and messes with darb, are useless if we are doing our jobs right. <br />
<br />
We want you to believe our abilities arent all that, becaue they arent. You NEVER want your tank to be doing anything other then tanking, and in our case, wave of marr/prexus. It would kill us, trust me and every other paladin who says the same thing. Or for fun, take a level 65 paladin and never cast anything that can get snap aggro that warriors do not have. Notice how it is much harder for us then it is for warriors. All the utility in the world wont help if the mob wont hit us.&quot;<br />
<br />
The last two sentences in that last paragraph illustrate our points exactly. Try not using any of your snap agro spells that aren't available to warriors, using only your taunt button. Now, imagine having to do that over and over, with only a fractionally higher success rate based on our marginally higher taunt cap and you know what we go through. All the HP, AC, /discs, DPS and cap advantages we have don't mean shit if we can't get the mob to hit us. Currently, knights can, warriors often can't. Simple right.<br />
<br />
&quot;This was during the times when... amazingly... we couldnt buy our ways into groups most of the time. I, for one, will not repeat the fun of being lfg for 6 hours while warriors 7 levels lower (who have more hp/ac cause of itemization) get groups.&quot;<br />
<br />
Show me one warrior here that advocates a return to the RoK period? None, thought so, shut the fuck up about this and any future RoK/early Sov references, they are worthless and only serve to lower your sensibility. Besides, if you really wanna go back to ancient history, pre-RoK, warriors were rangers without spells, vastly worse than knights, and couldn't buy their way into a group while necros soloed to 50 in a month. <br />
<br />
&quot;So you would give us AT, increased skill caps, increased taunt caps, dual wield? Cause without aggro on spells, we DONT have the tools you do.&quot;<br />
<br />
Would you give us the ability to cast all the spells you deem &quot;useless&quot; because they aren't part of your snap agro arsenal (that includes all heals), and a mana pool to match yours? <br />
<br />
&quot;3 - A warrior will always have more HP/AC then a knight at the same level. This does not mean game level.<br />
<br />
4. A knight will have better Taunt abilitied then a warrior of the similar level.&quot;<br />
<br />
1) A level 65 knight will have more HP and AC than a level 55 warrior<br />
<br />
2) A level 55 knight will STILL have better taunt abilities than a level 65 warrior. <br />
<br />
Any questions? I think that's pretty clear<br />
<br />
&quot;Roots - Never used. Nt worth the potential problems it can cause, and if you have a healer, they haveroots as well. Group with a wizard/necro, and they have better. Group with a chanter, and they have better, or most likely will mezs it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Give warriors roots and you'll see an 80% decrease in number of warriors complaining about their agro abilities<br />
<br />
&quot;Heals - Good in a pinch, group heal is great for aggro and to save the group if needed. In an exp group, you shouldnt need to, if you do, theres something wrong (or you are doing poj trials)&quot;<br />
<br />
Take that methodology, replace the term heals with HP and AC and you have our case. Only good in emergency<br />
<br />
&quot;DA - if you need this... theres really trouble.&quot;<br />
<br />
See /disc defensive in XP groups<br />
<br />
&quot;Stuns - U dont like having to rely on cease as a 2nd stun to akilae. I have to however, as every other stun either takes too long to cast and/or pushes the mob. When tanking, you do not want to be shooting the mob all around. Is it a mistake that stuns draw aggro? No. Stuns should piss the mob off. If you were trying to beat on someone and he could make you just stand there for a few seconds unable to hit him, or interrupt your spells, you wouldnt like him either (this is mob ai)&quot;<br />
<br />
I'd kill to have to rely on any steady form of agro control that I could actually predict or regulate. Simple as that. Don't say the word &quot;taunt&quot; or &quot;disarm&quot; because you'd be full of shit and you know it<br />
<br />
<br />
You come here trying to dispell the paladin &quot;myth&quot;, and yet to manage to create a paladin myth of your own, and a warrior myth to match. Piece of advice, go back home to PoN junior, come back when you have an actual argument that holds some water. Don't let the door smack you on your way back.</div></div><hr />

<br />
After that quote, any shred of credibility you might have had was gone.  You flat out state that without all the agro tools you have, the mob hits some one else.  Yet this situation is ok for warriors.  Yes, our taunt caps higher, so we might get a succesfull taunt 1 or 2 % more often than you, and yet you simply could not live with that situation.  All those extra hp's and ac I have over a paladin mean nothing because a paladin can grab agro almost for sure, and I cannot, no matter how good a weapon I might some day get.<br />
<br />
The rest of your post was the usual &quot;well, I don't use most of my other spells&quot; crap.  Who knows, maybe you are even being honest and do not.  But they are there.  You have utility, a warrior has none.  You may not use it, but it is there.<br />
<br />
It does not take a brain surgeon to understand why you are so willing to downplay your abilities.  Life for paladins is good.  Your only main competition for exp groups comes from SK's.  Why take a chance you might have to compete with a third class for tanking roles?</div></div><hr />

If a hybrid can tank forever on without any med breaks, own or for healers, you do not need a better tank. So the reason to pick a warrior over hybrid is ?</div></div><hr />

If aggro is giving you that much trouble, perhaps you (or the group) are not ready to try to maximize your XP gained per time spent.  Of course, it's not like a group will take it kindly you telling them that they, essentially, suck.  <br />
<br />
The best warriors are significantly better than the best hybrids in an XP group by a far margin.  You can't do better than a certain point and the best warriors (gearwise) can hold aggro easily and they certainly outtank and outdamage the best hybrids by a considerable margin.<br />
<br />
Any level of warrior is still considerable better than any similar level of hybrid (gearwise) in a good group.  Unfortunately, the reverse is also true... any hybrid is considerably better than any warrior of similar gear in a bad group by a huge margin, and the bad groups outnumber the good by a large margin...</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for some things you said...<br />
<br />
Without our aggro generating spells, we are a warrior with less hp, less ac, worse atk, lower defensive caps, no AT bandaids, a lower taunt cap, fewer EB Bandaids (and be honest, how many knights have a rz 2hander?).<br />
<br />
Maybe you forgot some of your utility : Group healing (everybody love pals versus AEing mobs), root, pacify, ivu, lay hand...<br />
And to be honest, BoW is pal equipable too. it's only 1 weapon over 3600 in this game, and there is tons of PAL SHD weapons with damage greater than delay you can choose between.<br />
<br />
<br />
Our mana pool is normally sapent holding aggro, not healing. On the offchance the only other class that can heal us in the group is a druid, we can use supernal cleansing. If a cleric or shaman is in the group, or heal over times dont hold and our quick heal (light of nife) is horribly pathetic in hp/mana ratio.<br />
Yes. You can't chain cast all your spells, it's situationnal as everything in this game. I can't use taunt if I'm not tanking omg !!! Wizards cant use some of their spells on some mobs with high resists, and why enchanters got nukes ? And Shroud of stealth do nothing in fights ! The answer is : it's situationnal..<br />
<br />
<br />
Knights have access to... 0 weapons better then warriors<br />
Well... all I can say is... hahahahaha.<br />
<br />
Thats exactly the truth. We can only tank decently because we can hold the mob on us. My 8100+ hp means nothing if the mob wont touch me.

Even chain stunning now, it is possible for a rogue, wizard topull aggro if they wanted to. Imagine that whth worse taunt then you~<br />
<br />
You must not have played the same game as my paladin friend, who tanked easilly with available gear BEFORE luclin. I admit the hybrid penalty was unjustified at this time, but paladin were tanking correctly, assuming you stop equiping yourself with wis gear and concentrate on AC.<br />
And why a rogue or a wizard would want to get aggro ? of course they can, the game as a damage dealer consist to kill while NOT aggroing !<br />
<br />
We bring NOTHING besides tanking to a group<br />
huh... so you tank whith no spells in your cast bar ? you're bitching like those rangers who say archery is situationnal and use it on everything in this game that drop something.<br />
<br />
I will not commentate your buff description... as a tank I know occurences of HP buffs. Basically you can use your buffs unless there is something by a true caster... so what's the problem ?<br />
<br />
Roots - Never used. <br />
...<br />
Lull/pacify/whatever - Useless.<br />
...<br />
Heals - Good in a pinch, group heal is great for aggro...<br />
DA - if you need this... theres really trouble.<br />

ROFL ! so you decided those were useless, heh ? try use them in some situations you'll see... crowd control, single pulling, invincibility in differents situations, and ability to heal an entire group is USELESS ?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">06-02-2003, 05:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">All those changes people asking is, ultimately, futile.  Even with game-breaking balancing changes, a warrior will NEVER have better aggro than a Hybrid.  If the warrior has that much aggro, no one would ever want a Hybrid.  When is the last time you took a Paladin because he can root or group heal or stun or rez?  No, you take a Hybrid because he has aggro.  If they don't beat Warriors on this department, they would never get chosen in a group, at least not when a Warrior is present.  <br />
<br />
So warriors will never have aggro as good as Knights.  Either this is enough to get you into a group, which by current standard means you can keep a mob off a wizard hitting SoS as fast as it'll refresh.  In that case, we also again made Hybrids obselete because your aggro was enough to keep even the stupidest of players alive, so why would anyone ever need anything better?  Sure a Hybrid is still better at aggro, but it doesn't matter.<br />
<br />
Or this isn't enough to get you into a group, in this case your stupid caster will still get themselves killed, and guess what's going to happen?  That's right, they'll get that Hybrid instead who can still keep the mob off them like they always have been able to.  You're back to where you started, despite having a bunch of upgrades that are, in most likelihood, gamebreaking.  <br />
<br />
Improving warriors has the net effect of either making Hybrids useless, or doing absolutely nothing.</div></div><hr />

We cant chain taunt, Albeit that would be sweet as all could be.<br />
I know PoP is the measuring stick atm, But a lot of warriors that tank even up to tier 3 BoT etc will never see a BoW or BoC <br />
<br />
So why are those also brought up and beaten like a dead horse by every paladin trying to prove some point in the uber l3wt school?<br />
<br />
Warriors need to be changed.<br />
Thats what its about, We dont give a damn about Paladin/Shadowknight Aggro. Big deal you have kei and can pull aggro endlessly. We just want simply changes implemented into our class to make us a more effective tank. <br />
<br />
And this change needs to affect ALL warriors. Not just the ones in pop. When a 36Sk can take aggro from a 45 warrior without blinking for giggles. There is a problem.  (I do it all the time to piss the MT off, Sorry I commited a sin but its boring lfg for 6 hours at a time in BoT as a war)<br />
<br />
Not only do we need mitigation changes made. We need aggro generation changes.  But in the end we shouldnt take away from the base classes of Pal/Sk the players behind them worked hard jus as we have to advance their characters.  They dont deserve a nerf bat (tho I kinda like rumble's brutal honesty to nerf &lt;3 to joo bro)<br />
<br />
What Pal/Sk's dont understand is. Its time for warriors to come into their own. Short of the dodge cap raising we havent had our own TRUE improvements in a long time.  With SoL and PoP The hybrids came into their own calling revealed. They could generate aggro like no one's buisness, And they got our same mitigation.<br />
<br />
Warriors now need to be brought up ,  The only good thing a AVERAGE war has left is his ability to use defensive to help his guild make epic kills on Fay etc using defensive. <br />
<br />
One myth we must dispell if anything should be done is the myth of the warrior. Not every War has uber loots, Not every warrior is 65 and Elemental flaged, Not every warrior is even in PoP yet. And its getting harder for us as a whole to advance and continue because Aggro can be out generated from level 9 up by a Hybrid. <br />
<br />
So please Hybrids understand one thing. We dont want to nerf you, We just want to come into our own light, And the only way for us to do so. Is to have changes made to warriors from the get go.<br />

Now, since none of these things actually happen, something must be wrong with the paladin logic.<br />
<br />
2 - 3 Classes fit the tank role and no other role. These are Warrior, Paladin, Shadowknight. Wrong, plain wrong.  In most cases, only the warrior is sentenced to only playing the tank role.  SKs and Paladins can actually pull very well, almost as well, if not better than a monk.<br />
<br />
Lull was significantly upgraded, and is an incredible pulling tool, even more useful than FD in a good number of cases, actually.  Paladins can pull pretty damn well using it, and if they get two...well, you DO have root.  Lull and root are STAYING, in my eyes, as something paladins do bring to groups over warriors.<br />
<br />
Downplay these spells all you want, Paladins have them and Warriors don't.  Whether or not you actually CHOOSE to use them to your advantage, you have them, they are part of your class, and therefor they are going to be included in any discussion about the capabilities of paladins.  I know how they can be used, and your hypothetically &quot;perfect&quot; situations are less common than me getting Hand of Virtue from turning in a rune word.<br />
<br />
If you dont understand it by now, an exp group is designed so 1 member, usually paladin, sk or warrior, takes ALL the damage, and gets healed with CH, druid CH, or shaman heals, while the rest of the group kills the mob. You know, I had so much fun thinking up replies to this statement.  Because, as we all VERY WELL know, there's no exp group out there that could EVER POSSIBLY survive without the oh-so-holy trinity of the tank/healer/slower.  It's simply not possible...no, that quad group of Beastlords/Magicians/Necromancers out there tearing up PoV/PoS cannot possibly be doing that without hacking the game...or the fear-kiting groups in PoD cannot possibly live (they don't have a tank or even a slower!  My god, I'd better get on my cleric and race over to the graveyard and await their inevitable corpses).<br />
<br />
Yup, everything really does depend on the holy trinity and a perfect group setup...and no one in PoP could ever get exp any other way.  Thank you for setting me straight, I have seen the light!  I must go towards it...oh wait, it's just some paladin casting Flash of Light.<br />
<br />
You mean, without your agro generating spells, you're nothing but a dumbed down warrior? Funny, last I checked, being able to buff yourself with a symbol when your only healer is a druid wasn't a warrior ability. And I just can't find any warrior who can put a HoT on themselves, healing themselves 250hp/tick AND tank at the same time, buying a healer some additional time to get a heal off, when all discs and AA abilities are down. I've yet to find a non-VT enabled warrior (VT-enabled warriors are harder to find than you think) who can have 2 procs on his favorite 2handed blade. I've yet to find a warrior who can cast haste on themselves.  And really, be honest, how many warriors have a rz 2hander...or to turn it around, how many warriors do you know who can get ahold of a sword with 5 instant charges of CH?<br />

my res is worthless to me. If I ever have to use it, we are in a zone/area where we should not be, therefore we never should have been there, so i should have never had to use it in the first place. You mean you shouldn't be in a place where it's a challenge?  Or possibly where your healer doesn't have every mana regen known to man?  It's no wonder you're so jaded then.</div></div><hr />

Wrong~<br />
No lvl 60+ pal is going to mem a lull spell ever again. You can consider that lull line was removed from Paladins at higher levels.<br />
Why ? simple. best Paladin lull (Pacify lvl51) spell work only on max lvl 55 mobs.<br />

Paladins did not get any lull upgrade with PoP while clerics and enchanter got it ( their lull works up to 65, and was up to 60 before PoP ).<br />

I like talking about the non traditional group bit. <br />
<br />
Ive seen paladin and enchanters duo. Its a enhancement of the enchanter soloing except the paladin can instantly take agro when the charm breaks and keep himself healed till the enchanter can take his time and recharm it. Warrior's definately can't do that. Warrior and shaman combo works, paladin and shaman combo works better.... I do not know about this warrior doing more damage then paladin bit. It seems they are about the same using the same weapons. Paladin's get better weapons easier, I think the warriors they are talking about are Elemental guild top warriors. Average warrior does not really do that much damage. And then paladin's forget undead. There are enough undead in the game to make a difference. I was fighting the undead knight guy in PoN past the hobgoblin caves and my paladin friend was hitting him, He was clensing the mob for 5800 and up hits. Thats pretty decent damage......... He told me that he sometimes his as high as 7900. <br />
<br />
Te paladin who said their hp was 8100 and they never rampage. At 65 right now my hp buffed is about 7300. Thats complete hp buffs. Atm I am a casual player, but whatever paladin's lack in base hp's they definately make up in items. <br />
<br />
Slight hp difference<br />
Slight ac difference (lets face it ac stops meaning anything after 1300 ish)<br />
no mitigation difference<br />
for non undead, no noticeable damage difference. <br />
Paladin has tons of useful spells that cost them nothing. <br />
Warrior has pitiful disciplines that cause them more troublem then they are worth. To be honest I want nothing more then for defensive to be deleated and it to stop being a crutch for us that other people can point out. <br />
<br />
Lets look at the bright side. We are all morons for putting this much effort into a game. Oh way the bright side sucks. <br />
<br />
We can go on arguing endlessly about who sucks more, what would be nice is to find a fix where no class gets nerfed. I want paladin's and warriors to be in the same group and to have fun working with each other............ Then together I can hold the ugly stick, and a paladin can hold a nerf bat and together we can beat the proverbial crap out of a caster. <br />

You might well be right about lull up in the higher levels, but you also should know that they're expanding the exp range, which means more people are going to be fighting mobs that yet still can be lulled, so it's staying.  The game changes a lot in the higher planes, but of course there's many warriors who don't have as many problems in the higher planes due to access to much better equipment (agro weapons).  I'm more focusing on the lower range (first 2-3 tiers) where this problem still exists, and is more in the majority, as well as lower levels.<br />
<br />
Yes, true...a hybrid tank is brought into the group because of his tanking ability and the fact that he can hold agro, that's kinda the minimum to be able to tank you know.  But how do you make the decision when there's multiple tanks to choose from?  Lets say you see, on the LFG tool, one of each tank class pal/shd/war...you know of all three (you've grouped with them before), and all of them hold agro decently well enough.  How do you choose?  In most common exp groups, you're looking for the best tank for your group, and if you're healing is subpar (it's a pickup group, they're not well known for being balanced every time), you're going to want the class who can compensate for shortcomings.  I'd be picking the paladin.  If I had no snarer, or even no puller, a shadowknight might be more my liking.  <br />
<br />
Many paladins look at how if they lose their agro, they're useless.  I look at it as even if warriors had closer (not equal...instead of hybrids being 100 and warriors being 50, it was more like hybrids 95 and warriors 70.), now things in the agro department (compared to the tanking department) are more equal...but really, other than tanking, what can a warrior bring?  /shield?<br />
<br />
Useless huh?  Would never be using in the group with a competant healer?  That's interesting, because looking on the cleric boards I see threads about how to work with the paladin heals in their groups.  Now if they're so useless, why is the best healing class in the game (on direct heals) trying to figure out how to work with the fastest healing class in the game?  Many healers love not having to work as hard on healing, they don't find paladin heals very useless.  Only people who seem to think that are the paladins themselves, especially when talking about how powerful their class overall is.<br />
<br />
Yes, paladins bring agro, we all know that, but in a decision between tanks who can all hold agro (thereby taking it out of the equation), you also look at what else they bring...and warriors bring a LOT less than paladins and shadowknights.</div></div><hr />

My sk friend and I are in same group...he can tank as well as I can.  He can hold aggro much better than I can.  He can fd pull. I can train 5 mobs to camp.  Same dps.  He can snare mobs that run, I cant.  Same difference. WTF do I bring to the group except to mooch xp.<br />
<br />
We as warriors are not asking for more aggro control than a paladin or sk.  If an sk has 100% aggro control and paladins get 95% why is it warriors get about 40%.  We just want around 80%.  We are supposed to have significantly more hp and ac...why is it that my sk and pally friend have within 400 hp as I do and probably higher ac than I do.  I may be pming an uber guild...it does not mean that I carry a BoC or BoW around.  <br />

<br />
ROFL a knight who steals aggro like that deserves to die, and will die. Just because a knight can take aggro, doesnt meen its a smart thing to do. <br />
<br />
Its all about knowing and playing your class well. Warriors are one of those classes with the fewest utility tools available to them. Thats why every guild of a certain size and at a certain lvl of progression equip their warriors with the uberers items like BoC to make their job easier.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You know, you missed the point and were insulting at the same time.  Yes, well no shit, we know that a Knight wouldn't want to steal aggro in the scenario presented.  The point was, he sure as hell could.  How frequently will a 55 Warrior have more HP and AC than a 65 Knight?  Unless the Warrior is tricked to all hell and back and the Knight is ghetto as hell, hardly ever.  How frequently will a 55 Knight be able to out aggro a 65 Warrior?  Whenever he damn well pleases.<br />
<br />
There is the disparity, Mr. It's all about knowing and playing your class well.  Knights have got an advantage from level 9 in aggro control that lasts the entire freaking game.  Warriors have an advantage from level 1 that lasts until maybe the mid to late 50s and from then on it's all about gear and levels.  If the Knight has enough of both, then he'll tank just as well or better than the Warrior.  While the Warrior will never, under no circumstances, with any weapons you care to name, have anywhere near equal aggro generation.<br />
<br />
And add to this, the Knight is given addition abilities that assist their groups which Warriors can't even compete with.  All we get is defensive.  So if you're setting up to take on a boss mob, yeah having a Warrior around is a nice to have.  Otherwise, there really isn't much of a point these days unless they're a friend or guildmate.</div></div><hr />

Warriors do more damage, take less damage, and kill stuff faster than any Hybrid which increases net XP gained over time.  If aggro is giving you that much trouble, perhaps you (or the group) are not ready to try to maximize your XP gained per time spent.  Of course, it's not like a group will take it kindly you telling them that they, essentially, suck.  <br />
<br />
The best warriors are significantly better than the best hybrids in an XP group by a far margin.  You can't do better than a certain point and the best warriors (gearwise) can hold aggro easily and they certainly outtank and outdamage the best hybrids by a considerable margin.<br />
 <br />
<br />
Well, at least you dont have class envy heh.  I dont see much difference in XP groups from hybrid and warrior.   <br />
<br />
Warrior adds a little more dps, mitigation is about the same (hybids supplement their raw mitigation with the odd stun, tap).  Aggro from a warrior is slightly less, but they can still manage fine.  In danger situations warrior can disc, hybrid has some spells to use .. all up seems fairly balanced.<br />
<br />
I do think they could add in some common droppable +hate warrior only weapons for the 50+ crowd though, particularly those who get to 65 without any gear at all .. <br />
<br />
Still, no matter what class tank you are .. your still going to run into trigger happy casters .. and they bring it on themselves.<br />

<br />
As for root, heals, group heals, heal over time, brells, aura of crusader, crusaders touch, and res etc ..<br />
<br />
All damn useful spells, and I use them all constantly.<br />
<br />
However I do think warriors can tank and hold aggro just fine in xp groups.  Although I would concede its tough for warriors who dont have good weapons.  They should add in a few easier to get +hate weapons to equip those guys in 50+ range (some up to 65 who have got crap for gear because they dont have a decent guild - not their fault).<br />
<br />
Pally is not a warrior, and warrior isnt a pally.  I am not averse to adding some utility to warriors, but dont think it isnt about one thing - tanking.  Remember the other abilities add utility to our class, they dont make us a better tank .. and at the end of the day .. thats what its about.  <br />
<br />
We got better aggro, but lower dps, mitigation and hp.  <br />
<br />
Aggro is a very important factor, and I would say many warriors could use some more tools to generate it .. as people are saying BoC and BoW dont drop from orc pawns.  Personally I dont see why there cant be warrior weapons with +hate at every level of the game .. it sure seems they rely on these weapons a lot.<br />
<br />
I say, add in some fun utility effects for warriors .. massive knockback (re-usetimer), pinning mob (re-use timer, low duration) and so on .. these kinds of things are great to add flavor to your character ..<br />

<br />
3 - A warrior will always have more HP/AC then a knight at the same level. <br />
<br />
But then you talk about not needing your heal spells ina  group because....<br />
Clerics in my guild can ch me on most mobs without running out of mana or needing me to heal. Shaman and most druids can as well. <br />
<br />
Well guess what.  If the healing classes can heal you without running OOM, then our &quot;superior AC, HPs, and mitigaion&quot; mean absolutely nothing.  If the group's healer can heal a paladin without running oom, then why would they want a warrior.  ALL the warrior brings to the table is tanking ability (and by what you just wrote about yourself, the extra tanking ability of a warrior is meaningless for exp groups because a well-geared healer can keep a paladin tank alive just fine).<br />
<br />
Since there is no tanking difference (And you yourself just said that in an exp group there isn't) what is the compelling reason to choose a warrior?  <br />
<br />
I can give you a compelling reason to choose a pally.  (Far superior aggro control)  There are other &quot;utility&quot; things that come up as well... (like the ability to heal in an energency like a LD healer, etc... but we can ignore those for this conversation.<br />
<br />
What does a warior bring?  Maybe a little more dps?  Guess what?  PEOPLE DONT CARE about how much DPS their tank is putting out.  All they care about is:<br />
<br />
1.  Can I heal this guy without going OOM?  <br />
2.  Can this guy hold aggro when we heal/tash/slow?<br />
<br />
The answer to number 1 is &quot;YES&quot; for BOTH paladins and warriors.<br />
The answer to number 2  &quot;YES&quot; for paladins and &quot;if his weapon procs&quot; for warriors.<br />
<br />
No matter how many &quot;EB Bandaids&quot; you give us, the fact remains that warrior aggro comes down to the luck of weapon procs and is unreliable.  Knight aggro is on-demand and can be controlled by the player.<br />
<br />
Which person do you want managing aggro in your group?  The one that can tank just fine and can always control aggro... or the one that can tank just fine and has to hope for an early proc of his weapon to keep the mob from eating the slower?</div></div><hr />

The ugly truth  however is that there is a huge class disadvantage for warriors and it doesn't start at level 60 in velious it starts at whatever level warriors had to try and make more money than any and every other class to keep up all the while having the least resources to do so. We have ZERO class advantages unless placed in a raid situation, and even to make it up to the top it takes more dedication and knowhow and moxy than any and all of the rest of you lazy bastages, now couple that with murphy's law and the survival of the fittest, this is where the &quot;true&quot; class imbalance starts and this is the underlying problem, because this is an online game not with 40 of yur buddies at the same house ( for least 99% of us) . It's work ethic, flat out warriors have to put out far more than the rest. We certainly can't solo, least not until we have basically won the current expansion, even then as an example say you have all the best gear 10k+hps with BoW and few other toy weapons as some may have, I highly doubt that even then any warrior no matter  how leet and disciplined will be able to solo more than a low end blue or mobs 2 expansion prior with practically unsellable loot (this is hypothetical based on my previous exp and one in particaular tryng to bow kite in Sol Ro at the GY with Zek Bow, believe me not worth the effort ). So how do you work for yourself  as a warrior? (before VT i typically found myself fighting over mobs with 45th level pet classes for cash loots as myself at level 65) Post VT entering ele planes I found CoD rats to be a  better cash resource spot (but here again reliance on others to well lets be honest EAT, buy arrows, tradeskill as necessary and buy all those damn batteries for equipment you weren't lucky enough acquire prior to PoP)<br />
<br />
So my point is just this. its not hybrids that are the problem its a serious lack of general class balance to warriors. Truly if verant's original idea was to force players to have to work with each other warriors are still the only ones filling that role 100% . even now. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ragnarz</div><div class="date">07-14-2003, 09:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bottom line<br />
<br />
Equipment<br />
Warriors are suffering from an itemization DISADVANTAGE much in the way monks once had an advantage. Here SOE repeated one of its most gross errors, just in reverse. Class specific armor should maintain a REAL gap between warrior and knight. The gap atm is an illusion. kizrak and raex should get a kick up in AC and HP. Aternatively, make the kicker we get from these stats be more valuable that would have a resounding impact on the class and not just the middle tier and up. Forget about the Time drops that again reinforce the all/all stupidity accessability is so limited.<br />
<br />
Weapons<br />
As for the person who said that knights and warriors have equal access to weaponry, go do a alakhazam search sometime and get an education. Starting in NTOV and all the way up knights have a cornacopia to choose from. It should be self evident that warriors suffer due to their weapon dependency and very limited choices. There are only a handful of worthy weapons. Nuff said.<br />
<br />
Mitigation/Avoidance<br />
take two identically equipped warrior and knight in an exp group, assume agro lock, the priests will find little or no difference. How can this be so? Should a warrior not have an advantage here? This is their defining role, lol.<br />
<br />
Agro<br />
This is a compound problem. weapons and taunt vs weapons and spells. I do not think its terrible but its certainly inequitable. Sadly there is no simple fix to this. Increasing DPS is likely the least unbalancing. Improving taunt may trivialize too many thing. Doubtful this can be fixed at all.<br />
<br />
Utility<br />
My only utility is /disc defensive on a raid. class defining yada yada yada. Too bad not every warrior gets to be MT. WTH do I bring to the table on a raid if im not MA/MT etc. How do I justify filling up a precious slot of the 72? In an exp grp I can AET once every 10/15 minutes and save someone in an emergency, wow aint that impressive. Knight utility is broad there is no comparison. Where is the tradeoff for such varied utility? <br />
<br />
Conclusion<br />
Currently, there is no longer a siginificant difference to having chosen to play a knight vs a warrior in respect to tanking abilities. This is the source of all these digital turds we see popping and repopping on the knight and warrior class boards. The disinformation, misdirection, faulty logic was entertaining for a short period of time but now its just sad. i stopped reading the monk board because it started become a virulent bitch session. Our class board is on the verge of doing the same. Only the eternal optimist thinks that there is a meaningful response from SOE on the way. You all just have to come to terms with it and stop the whining, waste of adrenalin. <br />
<br />
Its a game, have fun, set goals, do whatever turns you on. I guess if arguing into the wind turns u on then do that /sigh.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, okay.  You make a valid point.  However, has SoE ever fixed a class when no one at all spoke up that there was a problem?  Not to my knowledge.  Which class is the class that seems to get the most to address their various concerns?  Generally I'd say it's Druids, one of the classes most vocal about their problems.  So what are we going to do?  Suffer in silence as a macho Warrior type is supposed to do and feel like 4 years of our time has been totally trivialized by one screwed up expansion upon which they're very liable to base other expansions or bitch and moan a little in hopes that someone somewhere is paying attention and might (god forbid) do something about it?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Graal the Dorf</div><div class="date">07-14-2003, 03:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't really agree with the original poster as far as the usefullness of paladin spells.Let's be honest here. Root is a very nice ability to have and can save a group. Our stuns are usefull for interrupting casters, aside from the aggro they produce. I think he was exaggerating a bit when saying our spells aren't worthwhile at all. But I also think that most warriors overstate the usefullness of those spells in terms of getting a group. It is much more usefull and much less difficult to root a mob when you are not the main tank, for instance.<br />
<br />
Long ago, the balance for paladin's having less tanking ability than warriors was that we could downtime heal to reduce the load on the cleric. Back when healer mana was the primary bottleneck for xp gain, it was a decent balance for lesser tanking. The problem is that with the current mana regen of healers and the massive disparity in healing ability between main healers and paladins, that benefit is essentially not usefull anymore. How many people sit around between pulls waiting for their healer to regen mana? If you are in a situation where the healer has low mana regen, the paladin is going to have low mana regen as well, without the benefit of being able to med during fights (if the paladin is medding during fights he is essentially acting as a castrated cleric). Due to this, the primary role of paladin healing has become emergency healing. We are given a very fast cast heal that heals a decent chunk of health for the finger wigglers (800hp) but has a downside of being very mana intensive. How many people design their groups with that sort of thing in mind? I've seen people mention our group heals. Our group heals are very, very nice for raids, but much less usefull for xp grouping. Notice I didn't say useless. They are used from time to time. I will occasionally use a group heal after a cleric uses divine arb. That isn't really to save the cleric mana, it is because I have little else to spend my mana on if I'm not tanking. The other benefit of group heals is that you don't have to target the person you need to heal. Generally group heals aren't used much in xp groups due to their cost and lack of return unless multiple people need healing.<br />
<br />
What other spells do paladins have besides roots and healing that a group would need? Stuns. What else? That is essentially it. I see someone bring up the lull line: <br />
<br />
Wrong, plain wrong. In most cases, only the warrior is sentenced to only playing the tank role. SKs and Paladins can actually pull very well, almost as well, if not better than a monk.<br />
<br />
Lull was significantly upgraded, and is an incredible pulling tool, even more useful than FD in a good number of cases, actually. Paladins can pull pretty damn well using it, and if they get two...well, you DO have root. Lull and root are STAYING, in my eyes, as something paladins do bring to groups over warriors.<br />
<br />
<br />
Our lull line is very usefull in some situations, but generally not in xp situations. Our best lull has a level limit of 55. A paladin can't pacify anything beyond tier 1 unless you are talking about the DC bait mobs. Our pulling generally isn't any better than a warrior for mobs in PoP. <br />
<br />
Our heals, while usefull, don't get us groups. Our roots, while usefull, don't get us groups. Our aggro and our tanking ability get us groups. We do not get groups as anything other than tank, unless people really can't find anyone else to fill that last slot in the group to get the full group bonus. We have the lowest DPS of any class in the game other than clerics (I've been beaten badly by clerics in Ssra due to hammer procs), and our utility is almost completely based on our healing ability and roots. Be honest, what other group role does a paladin have besides tanking?</div></div><hr />

Not having a Cleric is an excellent reason to get a Paladin tank.

It fly's as well as saying that warrior defensive is useless in exp groups! Of course you probably rarely use defensive in exp groups except in the odd emergency, well guess what, when I am MT in an EXP group (not raid) I don't buff, I don't heal, I don't rez, except in the odd emergency.<br />
<br />
However even if warriors had the same aggro as knights I do not think it would hurt knights getting groups, at the end of the day people just want a tank that works reasonably well. The problem hinges on increasing a warriors aggro, and giving warrior snap aggro + defensive would break a lot of content that isn't currently broken!</div></div><hr />

Tell me, exactly what content is that, that would magically be broken by only having a couple seconds of alone time instead of ten? Because that's all the difference giving warriors some form of snap aggro would make.<br />

I mean, you should be able to come up with any number of things on demand that are clearly broken with the addition of snap aggro on warriors, since you did say &quot;a lot of content&quot; would be broken.</div></div><hr />

In that situation, just about every group would be toast, whether they have a form of CC that neutralizes the add's melee or not.<br />

The assertion that warriors &quot;have no ability to perform crowd control&quot; is patently false. Warriors don't have a crappy root, they but they DO have AETaunt. Their aggro generation is dependant on procs, and as such is not interruptible, whereas a hybrid tanking more than one mob stands a greater chance of their spells being interrupted, and therefore not generating aggro for them.<br />

I'd say most people would say Paladin because they don't take damage noticeably worse than a Warrior and can help with the heals. This is much less valid for druids than it is for shamans.

Where would I find this mythical group that has a healer but doesn't have someone who can do root CC better than a paladin?

When grouped with a druid, 9 is a much better buff, which coincidentally doesn't stack with our self buff. When grouped with a shaman, a paladins buffs all stack. the caveat to that is the fact that total hp doesn't matter nearly as much when grouped with a shaman because their highest heal is 1950 hp.

Druids don't have fast emergency heals either, which is where the paladin comes in. That alone makes paladins more wanted than warriors in that situation.<br />
<br />

Nobody goes somewhere EXPECTING to die, come on now. Are you being this obtuse on purpose? The fact is paladins are the only other class able to rez (necros are not counted here as they cannot rez without cost), and if there is no cleric, the paladin would also be wanted over the warrior due to the fact that if there's no cleric and no paladin, there's no rez if needed, which can be decidedly inconvenient.<br />
<br />
 When grouped with a druid, 9 is a much better buff, which coincidentally doesn't stack with our self buff.<br />
Uh huh, and you can STILL buff with a symbol which stacks with Pot9, not to mention I believe you also get a straight AC buff, that stacks as well?<br />
<br />

No, there's just probably less downtime. Unless you're trying to tell me that buffing the caster's hitpoints isn't going to save their ass if and when they get aggro, and isn't going to give them that much more time to get a heal and get the mob under control?<br />
<br />
And by your own logic, it would be more efficient to have a hybrid MT over a warrior when there is a shammy healer, as, after all, the amount of hitpoints doesn't matter anyway. There goes the warrior HP advantage.<br />
 <br />
All of those benefits are nice, but they don't get paladins groups.  <br />
All these benefits, which you are trying to minimize and make like they're really nothing at all, help to make the paladin as attractive a choice as they are in experience groups. If you're saying they don't get paladins groups, then why don't you give up that spellbook? Give up your buffs, heals, rezzes, and the like, after all according to you they don't get a paladin groups, do they?<br />
<br />
Come on now, Graal.<br />
<br />
The fact is, in every single group that paladins join, they are able to contribute buffs to that group. The ONLY group that they are not able to contribute clerical buffs to is a group that already has a cleric. Their buffs stack with both a shaman and a druid's buffs, with the sole exception of the Heroic Bond line and Pot9. Added to this the fact that they have the fastest heals in the game, their healing abilities COMPLEMENT a druid and a shaman's heals. Additionally, they are the ONLY other class in the game that has a rez with no cost involved in it.<br />
<br />
Are you REALLY trying to say that all of those abilities really don't matter at all? <br />
<br />
Tell me, how quickly and loudly would you scream &quot;overpowering&quot; if warriors were even given ONE ability comparable with the ones listed above?</div></div><hr />

It seems to me that root is far superior to AE taunt when it comes a situation gone bad.  AE taunt will merely mean that the Warrior gets beat on by everything in range which means either he buys it and everyone else beats feet or who ever heals him next buys the farm as well.  Root, when it works, allows the Paladin to park the mob out of range, at least for a short time.  Yeah, other classes have root too, but rooting what you're tanking and then switching to the add with a couple of stuns to insure aggro works.  Either way both would be in trouble, but at least the Paladin has options that aren't just automatic suicide for someone.<br />
<br />
So now, you come on.</div></div><hr />

However, that does not negate the fact that warriors ARE able to perform CC on more than one mob, contrary to your assertion that they have no CC abilities whatsoever.<br />
<br />

<br />
You know, there's one of several options here. Either you a: don't group with decent healers, b: aren't a very good tank, or c: are being extremely pessimistic. Or it could be you consistently fight in zones that you're not geared well enough to tank effectively. I say consistently because you say they use of AETaunt is always a death sentence.<br />
<br />
I pop AE taunt on a regular basis, and contrary to your claim that it's suicide for the tank and/or the healear, I survive the vast majority of the time. It's not all that difficult to tank two and (rarely) 3 PoP mobs at a time, and be able to maintain aggro on them all. I do this on a regular basis when there's no other form of CC in the group.<br />
<br />
I really don't know why you always seem to die or your cleric seems to die whenever you have to CC a mob as well as the one you're taking, or even if you're just being extreemely pessimistic or whatever. But it's NOT a death sentence to use AE taunt, otherwise, why would the warrior community hold it in such high regard? It would be nearly useless to use. I have in fact saved far far far more lives using AE taunt than I've ever lost due to having to tank more than one mob at once. Like I said, it's very rare that I or the healer die due to the use of it.<br />
<br />
Hell, you don't even need to USE AETaunt to CC the second mob, all you gotta do is switch targets and taunt/build hate on it, and make sure you maintain your position on the hate list for both mobs.</div></div><hr />

But at 1300+ AC and 7200HP fully buffed I'm probably slightly better off than Joe Warrior, but not by much.  If I'm tanking two unslowed mobs in BoT, guess what, I'm dying very quickly.  If I'm tanking a slowed and an unslowed mob, I'm also dying pretty fast.  Two slowed mobs, maybe I might be able tank for a while, but I'll probably lose aggro on at least one of the mobs as soon as someone heals.  If I've used AE taunt to get them on me to begin with, I'll have to switch targets and rely on taunt, you know that thing we're all bitching about as being unreliable, remember?<br />

In fact I bet they would just rather avoid the entire thing in the first place. ^_^<br />
<br />
The game mechanics show that two monsters attacking something deal twice as much damage.  There is no way getting around that.  I don't care how uber one is.  If the group can't take dealing with twice as much damage as before AE Taunt doesn't help.<br />
<br />
You also downplay the small fact that your casters risk double the amount of trouble after the AE Taunt effect goes away.  Debuffers have to debuf twice if there is time.  Healers have to heal back twice as much damage.  Its one thing to draw heal agro.  Its something really dangerous to draw agro on two.<br />
<br />
These are the reasons why AE Taunt is a poor, almost non-CC way of dealing with extra monsters.  Other CC methods try to delay fighting other monsters.  AE Taunt just makes them all fight the Warrior at the same time.</div></div><hr />

No, there's just probably less downtime. Unless you're trying to tell me that buffing the caster's hitpoints isn't going to save their ass if and when they get aggro, and isn't going to give them that much more time to get a heal and get the mob under control?<br />
Downtime? Do you even group with shamans? My shaman wife can go from OOM to FM in less than a minute and a half.  The only reason my wife gets hp buffs while we are xping is so she canni more. She can take a round of melee from an xp mob, torpor herself, and still come out ahead on mana.<br />
<br />
If you are grouped with a shaman, I don't see how anyone but the shaman or the tank are going to be getting aggro unless you are grouped with complete and total idiots. Torpor/quiescence cast pretty fast and is generally more than enough for the shaman to cast on him/herself until you get aggro back. If an INT caster gets aggro from you after you taunt off the shaman's slow, kick them the fuck out, because they are a tard. <br />
<br />
On the CC issue, I personally woudn't rank AE taunt up there with roots, but that's my opinion. It's definitely a nice ability, but it does have severe drawbacks as far as CC is concerned. I'd rather be able to root, myself. It does in a way control the mobs, but it doesn't negate their damage output, which is the usual desired outcome of CC. Of course, the guaranteed successful taunt is nice. ;)<br />

I never said those things aren't worthwhile. Please point out where I said that.  I said those things don't get us groups. When people are putting together a group, they look specifically for tank, healer, slower. They don't look for tank_that_can_root_and_rez_and_fast_heal, healer, slower. If the secondary abilities that paladins bring are needed, the group is generally going to grab a specialist to do that specific job. When a group needs CC, they don't say &quot;let's get a paladin because he can tank AND root!&quot; they think &quot;we need a tank and a chanter&quot;. The overriding reason why we are chosen for groups is to tank. Anything else we bring is very much secondary.<br />

They tend to go &quot;We need a tank&quot;.   Generally the Paladin or SK is going to currently get picked first because it's much safer, has nothing to do with ancillary skills and NOTHING to do with defensive prowess, if you can do the job, you get the job.   <br />

I would like to begin by saying that the original Paladin poster is quite the know nothing arse that I have come to see ofter running in the upper levelled game of today.  To say that Root, Lulls, etc., are useless is someone that does not play their class well at all.  I can single pull quite easily with my Paladin... often in places that a WArrior cannot.<br />
   Both classes have definitive problems.... BUT.... I would clearly say that the Warrior has the most problems of the 2 classes.  My warrior has become my favorite of the two classes but the frustration is immense when a lower level Knight or one of equal level but with MUCh lower gear can easily pull taunt from me...  The Warrior taunt is seriously unbalanced between the classes even though they have a higher taunt cap.  The fact of the matter is that Warriors are getting shafted with Taunt.<br />
  As a Warrior we should be the ones that draw the aggro and keep it.  We are often, not always ladies and gents (Paladins are the Defensive tank and often have VERY high AC), the person holding the highest AC, hitpoints, etc. in the group.  It is OUR role as the Warrior to FIGHT... since that is our main concern we should be ABSOLUTELY, without ANY doubt the best of the tanks when it comes to holding aggro... it is our JOB... what we have grown up to do.  <br />
  Which makes the better tank?  Depends on the situation actually.  Overall... the Warrior, IMO since I play both, should be the MA... it is their role in life.  The Paladin can often be used as a SA or TA when splitting MoBs but IMO should NEVER be the MA if a Warrior with similar gear and level is available... they are DEFENSIVE tanks... and are not geared to outdamage the others... although... at this moment... that is also possible in certain instances... but that is something SoE has to take care of...</div></div><hr />

They tend to go &quot;We need a tank&quot;. Generally the Paladin or SK is going to currently get picked first because it's much safer, has nothing to do with ancillary skills and NOTHING to do with defensive prowess, if you can do the job, you get the job. <br />
<br />
Right. I don't disagree with this at all. You only need enough defensive ability to survive the encounter. Just like you only need enough healing ability to heal the damage done to the group. Defensive/mitigative/healing abilities have always been that way. There is a specific amount needed and anything beyond that amount is unneeded excess. The same is not true of DPS. After enough rangers and beastlords get geared well enough, we will be sitting here bemoaning the fact that they are taking our spots in groups because they tank well enough to survive and provide greater damage output than warriors and greater aggro control than knights do. <br />
<br />
See, even if warriors had a similar aggro ability to knights, I dont' think that KInights would be viewed as &quot;untankable&quot; or any less than they are now, the cat's out of the bag, they make FINE tanks, it's just time for the unfair advantage to end<br />
<br />
This part is what I disagree with, at least to some extent. Just due to the DPS differential, groups will pick warriors over paladins if there is no aggro differential. If the warrior could hold aggro nearly as well as a paladin with mana regen buffs then a warrior would hold aggro much better than a paladin without mana regen buffs. I really don't think I'm exaggerating when I say that would be crushing for paladins in experience groups. All of the things that we provide fall into the category of defensive/mitigative/healing abilities, and once a group has enough, it doesn't need any more. <br />
<br />
I remember during luclin when warriors and paladins were both more than adequate to tank just about any xp mob a group would go up against. I also remember many groups prefering warriors just because of the higher damage output compared to knights. There were also some groups that did prefer the aggro of knights. I really think this was the best period in terms of balance between the 2 plate tank classes. The only real problem at the time (in regards to tanks) was the fact that plate tanks weren't needed for xp grouping at all due to the underpowered damage output of mobs and the fact that killing as many as possible of the lowest blue mobs gave the most xp. In those instances, the greater DPS of a warrior was a very useful benefit to a group to get faster xp. I don't know how to get the balance between the plate tanks back to that point. I do know that negating the aggro difference between knights and warriors isn't going to do it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So what you're saying is that the ancillary skills/spells simply dont' compensate for the DPS difference between knight and warrior?  I'm not agreeing or disagreeing, just trying to understand your point of view.<br />
<br />
Would you be satisfied if the &quot;average&quot; warrior without awesome aggro weapons held aggro almost as good as the 'average&quot; paladin with no mana regen?<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure we both know that warriors would LOVE to be able to grab aggro to the extent of a mana regenless paladin.</div></div><hr />

Why? because we have to use lower ratio weapons with a proc (and hope for one) where knights dont have to worry about that, and can pick up whatever their highest DPS weapon is, and just cast a few stuns on inc to maintain aggro.<br />
<br />
course I have no proof of this, but it really wouldnt be that hard to test, would it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
who's going to do more DPS while tanking?<br />
who's going to have a harder time with aggro?<br />
<br />
even compaired to a warrior with a GSoT 31/30 I'm sure the answers would still be the same.<br />
<br />
The ONLY time a warrior's DPS is better then a knights is when we're using the same weapons, and the mobs back is to both of us (means we're not tanking, odds are, in a raid.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikos</div><div class="date">07-17-2003, 11:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its obvious there is an imbalance in the desireability between warriors and knights for exp groups.<br />
<br />
If Knights were 90% tanking of warrior and 100% aggro on demand, then warriors should be 100% tanking and 90% the aggro capabilities of knights. <br />
<br />
The differences : <br />
Warrior posses higher skillcaps, 300-500 hp advantage and disciplines.<br />
Knights posses Utility Spells and their unique abilities.   <br />
<br />
That would be balance.<br />
<br />
Gear used to be an advantage warriors had over other melee. But current itemization has taken away this advantage.<br />
<br />
DPS is not always an advantage warriors have over knights. It is relative to the weapon setup. The avg warrior will have lower dps weapons in favor of aggro, while the knights can use a good 2hander and hold aggro via spells.<br />
When it comes to undead, warriors are nowhere near paladins in DPS with Slay Undead. If there are undead mobs at a camp, you bet they will invite pallies that have SU for DPS. <br />
<br />
No group will take a warrior BECAUSE of his DPS, over a knight, for the tank spot. My DPS means nothing when tanking. Whatever slight DPS advantage I may posses over a Knight, it is utterly destroyed by the knight's ability to generate and lock aggro on demand. Rogues wont have to evade, Monks wont have to FD, Wizzies/mages/Druids/Necros can nuke/dot without being forced to hold back(which they have to do when a warrior is tanking).  The GROUP will kill mobs MUCH faster with the aggro lock of a paladin, than with a warrior's &quot;superior&quot; dps. <br />
<br />
<br />
So the Beef some knights seem to have over warriors getting more reliable aggro, is that it would place warriors on an EQUAL ground for a Tank spot in exp groups. That is unfair? <br />
<br />
Why do people insist that it would break the game if warrior had more reliable aggro? During a raid I tank a boss mob for 20 seconds, then call attack. Mob gets debuffed, everyone attacks. <br />
<br />
Additional means of reliable aggro, would simply lower the time I solo X boss mob before making the attack call. That is all. An ability to chain aggro a mob on demand would be too far fetched and unbalancing for warriors to posses.  <br />
<br />
Some solutions:<br />
<br />
-Warriors dont specifically need aggro on demand to make them more reliable in exp groups. An ability to 'root' the mob ( with a re-use time viable for exp grouping) would aid the situation and provide some added value(CC). <br />
<br />
-Giving warriors the innate ability(passive or activated) to randomly proc hate with whatever weapon they swing, would surely help a lot of warriors that cant get a hold of EB or taunting blow weapons. <br />
Warriors with hate procing weapons would simply get additional procs and gain more consistency on their aggro.<br />
<br />
-A friggin button you click to proc 400 hate on demand. Refresh timer of 30-60 seconds. Good filler between procs or when weapon fails to proc when needed.  <br />
<br />
So many ways they could aid our situation without making content trivial or nerfing other clases.</div></div><hr />

right now the hp gap is under a hundred.<br />
<br />
it *needs* to be about 1-2k to make things balanced.</div></div><hr />

I dont know where your getting under a hundred from</div></div><hr />

HP advantage from + HP Gear, 1 HP per STA, and whatever natural bonus, so still around around 550-600. (-10 from Rathe ring and 40 or so from war 1hder)<br />
<br />
Thats pure +HP, which doesnt factor in the natural difference in STA modifiers and natural HP a warrior has more of at lvl 65.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying its enuff, or not enuff, maybe i'm missing something, just saying I dont think your right, and when I see someone building a case on something thats not true, from my experience or knowledge I comment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">landrain</div><div class="date">07-19-2003, 07:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am not assuming he means High-End.<br />
<br />
I am betting he means tier 1-3 style, since Pal only equipment is cheaper and easier to get, and is in every zone tiers 1-3 and war gear is in umm..umm.. i forget. Oh yeah we get a hammer, and a shield...  <br />
<br />
Also a fact stated earlier that Elemental guilds use War to tank there, leaving the elemental pal to come to tier 3 and be better equipped than the warriors there...<br />
<br />
Whatever way you look at it, given equal level and gear, Warriors no longer have anywhere near to the 20% HP advantage they originally had. It is so much less now. And that is the point.<br />
<br />
Also considering how Originally Knights had SMALL.. mana pools, and with all the 100/100 gear and upgrades, we see knights with 4000+ mana REGULARLY... <br />
<br />
Well you can see that there is no tradeoff to being a knight. You get your cake, and the 7 course meal, and a coffe hour afterwards...<br />
<br />
Show me just ONE tradeoff Paladins have for being hybrids? There is none left...</div></div><hr />

Not everyone is uber, and these problems begin well before level 65.<br />
<br />
Paladins get their first stun in their first set of spells at level 9 and their first root at level 22. Warriors have to wait until level 59 and spend 23 aa points to even use AE Taunt, so please stop making a comparison where there isn't any.</div></div><hr />
