<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grhar</div><div class="date">06-05-2003, 06:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've seen a whole lot of posts talk about how Knights have *always* had superior taunt ability.  This is simply not true.  My first character was a paladin I created in May 1999, and retired him December 2000 at level 52.  Back then, taunt was merely a function of DPS, and dual wield was king.  As the 1H bonus scaled up dramatically after Kunark was released with the new level cap of 60, the disparity grew.  The DPS disparity between knights and warriors was fairly large... where knights might do 90% of the damage that warriors do nowadays, back then it was more like 70%.  We are also talking about the days before KEI and 15 mana stuns.  Mana was a luxury and only used in sparse quantities.  A paladin could outagro a warrior for 3 minutes, then when the mana tank was empty, the warrior was agro king until the paladin had time to med.<br />
<br />
The turning point which made paladins such good with agro was the introduction of the level 9 stun, Cease, which cost a negligible 15 mana (entered game during SoL era).  Now when grouped with an enchanter, a paladin could chain stun for indefinite periods, applying extra agro on demand.  Fast forward to the present, in the world of BST crack, KEI, the druid Glades line, FT... paladins now have massive mana regen, and stunning to maintain agro really isn't a drain on the mana pool.  And with the long duration of KEI, paladins don't even need to be grouped with an enchanter anymore to enjoy massive mana regen.<br />
<br />
So anyways, just wanted to point out that the knight's claim to being the kings of agro wasn't true for the first 2 years of EverQuest.  It was merely situational agro, not sustainable over indefinite periods of time like it is today.  The game has changed a lot in the past, and there is no reason to believe it won't continue to change in the future.<br />

Pre pop this was only a little bit of an issue and pre SoL it was practically a non-starter. Most of the reasoned warrior posts here accept that knights had it bad in the early expansions and only recently have come into their own and way ahead of warriors.</div></div><hr />

Disease Cloud<br />
SK-spell Lvl 9 - Everquest release.<br />
This spell used to call mobs from 200 range after a slow or tash or anything else...  this was in the days where slow aggro was nearly insurmountable for a warrior.<br />
Disease cloud was nerfed and Shadowknights got Terrors...<br />
<br />
Shadowknights have owned aggro since release after level 9 period.<br />
<br />
This is from a Shadowknight since beta...<br />

END QUOTE<br />
<br />
-Low mana stuns...  unlike warriors, I will choose not to comment on something I have little experience with.<br />
<br />
-Massive Mana regen - lies... only to a warrior who never uses mana would there EVER be massive mana regen...  I am always running OOM to do HALF the things I want to do.  This is with FT9 and elemental gear.<br />
<br />
-DPS boost... knights used to do less damage than they were supposed to...  like 50-60% of a warrior...  it was so bad that 1H weapons that dropped off the SAME mob (example Kreizenn) as the 2H that the knights wielded did more damage in the hands of a warrior than the 2H the knights wielded.  A single 1H should not outdamage a 2H weapon from the same mob.  Knights now average 80%ish of a warrior in melee. (119DPS Knight melee vs 147DPS warrior melee vs PoEb mobs.. both from the back, both using same weapon... (SEWS) both wearing full suits of elemental minus legs (and BP).<br />
<br />
-Itemization... Warriors tend to count the SK/PAL weapons and lump SK-only and Pal-only together thinking that pals can use Sk weapons...  They can't.  the number of Knight only weapons that either SK or PAL (not both) can use is about equal to warriors and their &quot;might as well be warrior only&quot; dual wield weapons.  the problem was that knights cannot use warrior 1H weapons due to their habit of MISSING all over the place. (5-7% more than warriors) and dealing nowhere near the average damage due to lower ATK.  Thus Knights required special weapons to even get to 80%.  Warriors/rogue/rangers/bards all have similar needs... Sk/pal have similar needs.<br />
This has all changed in PoP...  everyone uses SEWS or BoW or Time weapons... Warriors and Knights alike.<br />

Could you please stop the lies and rhetoric that everyone knows means nothing?<br />

<br />
A resisted or immune Dark is less than 200 hate...<br />
(after my 200 hate spell pulled off the resisted dark)<br />
An effective Dark (not resisted) does over 1000 hate...<br />
(two casts of the 600pt one, two casts of the 510 one didn't do it)<br />
<br />
This is measured by a Shadowknight who has spells that deal numeric unresistable hate.<br />
<br />
For comparison, one proc of Enraging Blow does 700 Hate.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dark seems about right when resisted/immune...<br />
<br />
Why would stun be any different?<br />
<br />
<br />
Someone please tell me why a warrior with no working knowledge of spells in the high end game can tell me with any authority besides &quot;grass is greener&quot; that stun aggro does too much?<br />
<br />
IF you have working knowlegde...  then please stop using the word &quot;knights&quot; as you are implying Shadow Knights as well.<br />
<br />
My aggro has already been nerfed into the toilet from where it was, and Shadow Knights actually HAVE spells that specifically cause hatred, and ONLY hate.<br />
<br />
Final note, a Knight who chain casts a spell and ONLY that spell EVEN if it costs them no mana is still paying a hefty price in the swings and cast time he is losing.  Remember, knights cannot cast two spells at once.<br />
<br />
That being said, I cannot effectively argue that paladin stun aggro is NOT out of whack...  The problem is, not a single one of these posts has proven anything except the fact that warriors are envious and willing to say anything as long as it gets them their upgrades.<br />
<br />
I do not disagree that warriors could use an upgrade...  the problem is WHERE that I disagree.<br />
<br />
Suggesting a nerf for something that you have proved time and time again that you have absolutely no understanding of is nothing less than childish.<br />
<br />
&quot;im broken, break them too&quot; is not cool.<br />

I was just saying, 'as a Paladin' you dont need massive mana regen in order to chain cast your basic stun.  as to how much aggro it generates, or how many attacks you miss out by casting a 1.5sec spell every 10 seconds or so, I'm sure we'd all have our opinions, but after playing a paladin into the 50's I feel fairly strongly that Cease (15m) and Desist (25m) can gain you much aggro for very little mana, and a minimal loss in DPS.<br />
<br />
I think perhaps the biggest thing is that the player is in control of these, and it isnt just a product of a random proc.<br />
<br />
no, I dont want to see 'Knights' nerfed.<br />
<br />
I do however want to be able to hold aggro against a BST slowing.  hitting taunt 6-8 times, and haveing my GoT proc 3 times durring that, and still not having aggro is unacceptable.<br />
<br />
and you'd be mistaken if you thought that last bit was a joke.<br />
(and it wasnt even a one time thing, was about 8 figths in a row.)</div></div><hr />

knights dont loose any weapon delay for casting spells that was removed fucking ages ago<br />
Nerfed or whatever you want to call it Kingts agro needs to be addressed because it is unbalancing. Just remember back to the days you got so many nice upgrades including removal of casting slowing you mele and removing mana penalties. Now that Kings get best of both worlds with fucking all/all items I think things starting to get a bit unblalncing. So now you running around with some FT gear mana pools of clerics and HP of warriors and still thinking you have hard time with agro....<br />

<br />
And of course you as a Shadow Knight have a greater understanding of the high end game stun aggro?  /nod Of course.  Shadow Knights are big time stun users, of course you're an expert on what or what isn't too much aggro for stun.</div></div><hr />

What a wonderfull line!  One question...are you always running 00M to do half the things you  need  to do?  I am sure you want to do even more, but are you able to do what you have to do without going 00M?  If not, can you explain to me why my friends who are pallies and SK's can both tell me that mana is a very minor issue to them, and not one of them has FT9?</div></div><hr />

Sometimes you will have plenty of mana regen to do your job, sometimes you won't have nearly enough. Sometimes you will have enough mana regen to just do the bare minimum, sometime you will have so much mana regen that you really don't have anything to spend your mana on. Sometimes you will have spend fair amounts of time medding to do you job. On the whole, it's pretty much a break even argument. Sometimes knight have to med to do their jobs, sometimes not.</div></div><hr />

Cease and desist is a nice target, but they arnt end all to be all, nor really nesicary for a knight to hold aggro....<br />

<br />
And?  I always thought an SK was an offensive tank and was suppossed to do more damage then a warrior if they were using spells.  If a SK does not use spells, then their dps will be about equal to a paladin due to same skill caps and similar weapon drops.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When you add in supplemental damage from pet and spells the same SK has a comfortable DPS advantage. This is fine, they *should* outdamage us.<br />
<br />
Let's stay focused on the areas where Warriors need improvement and not get distracted. From where I sit, relative DPS between Knights and Warrior is fine.<br />
<br />
I am concerned with Aggro and Tanking. Our aggro generating capability is poor and our tanking advantage is too small and shrinking with every expansion.<br />
<br />
No nerfs for Knights, I believe they are balanced. It is Warriors that need work.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tonight I was tanking underbulks in a group at RCY in PoD and this 53 SK (I am 55) fancied trying to tank them. Fair enough, less work for me. <br />
<br />
Here he comes, with total HP with Temperance just about same as my UNBUFFED crappy HP, and he tanks all the underbulks no problem. Worse, he never looses aggro.<br />
<br />
So he goes LD and I take back the tank job for a little while, and lo and behold, rogue is taking aggro, while I am praying for my weapons to proc.<br />
<br />
All the mobs were yellow or red to this 53 SK and he was doing a better job than me. Why ? Because the cleric who is on KEI btw, is whining that he has to heal two persons.. go ask the SK to stop casting all his aggro crap.. no no wont do.. mr SK says he isnt' t even trying to taunt.<br />
<br />
Tonigth, this SK really did it for me. He broke the spell, I was still eblieving I was a warrior. Well *** me. I'm useless.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Naw, not useless.  Just less useful.  Which means broken.  A Warrior can tank.  These days the Knights tank better.  A hard truth, but true none the less.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I remember the day the spell was broken for me.  Wasn't an SK that did it, but a crappy chanter that had to tash on incoming and then thru a fit because she got agro.  After the third mob, she told the group that either I left and they got a pally, or she was going to leave.  &quot;Warriors suck, I hate grouping with them&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
Yes, we can still tank, but are third choice at it generally.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is the biggest load of uninformed bullshit I've ever seen. I played an SK up to 64 before retiring him and I know you have absolutely NO FUCKING CLUE what you are talking about. I used a 45/40 two hander and did all of 49 dps with a 270 str (1139 self buffed atk). HOLY SHIT did I just say 49, let me spell it out for you FOURTY NINE DPS. With two dots, my spears, taps, and pet I was looking at 90ish dps. This is with KEI/Tranq/VoQ/Pact of Hate, 100%+ Haste (Forget what capped level is for a 64) AND hitting from behind. So tell me mister dumbass, where in the FUCK did you pull 120% from? I'd REALLY like to see those numbers personally.<br />
<br />
Oh and FYI If an SK is going to dot and nuke/tap EVERY mob he goes OOM within twenty-thirty minutes with VoQ and 220+int (Approx 3500ish mana, not counting 100+ mana items).</div></div><hr />

2. SKs have the same AC or better if they use a shield<br />

Of course you do, because you aren't a warrior sick of getting bent over in this game. Screw Verant/Sony and their idiot dev's who design bugged games with no clue of anything but collecting the money.</div></div><hr />

The shame, a 54 Druid, a REAL char got sold with it. It was so freaking hard quad kiting, boo hoo me. It took me one quarter the time to level as my warrior, boo hoo me.<br />
The sad thing are the idiots who defend warriors. If no one played them, as in the beginning of the game (yea, I was there), they would improve them. Crit hits were not in the game, and many other skills warriors got. No one damn well played them they sucked even worse than they do now. But no one playing them got Verant's attention, after they hemmed and hawwed and lied out their ass saying &quot;they were behaving as designed&quot;. No wait, they were designed to be the crap class of EQ (and rogues), rogues got made into Assasin's, awesome group chars. Now its time for warriors to become TANKS, make me a King Tiger, and that is the only way I will be happy. SKs and Paladins want utility you get to be the Ronson Lighters, Shermans, lights everytime.<br />
WoW will have none of the dumb monks, who don't belong in an Occidental Fantasy game (look even AD&amp;D moved them to the Orient where they belong), or Knights to confuse the mix. By cracky I bet a WARRIOR won't be a wimp class unable to solo a orc pawn, like crappy EQ!</div></div><hr />

<br />
SK nukes/dots should count as negative DPS because it takes away them from doing Zevfeer's Bite and Aura of Hate which adds a lot more DPS to the group than a SK can ever hope his spells can do.  <br />
<br />
Zevfeer + Aura of Hate is roughly 20 mana/tick and well above the mana regen you can expect in a normal group with a normal SK.<br />
<br />
As for soloing, there's nothing you can fear in the tier 2 planes so while they can solo, it's really slow.<br />
<br />
Aura of Hate is so ridiculously overpowered that it's hard for me to imagine why would a SK ever want to use spells to do damage, unless he doesn't have Aura of Hate.</div></div><hr />

5. Can solo<br />
<br />
1. SKs don't really have nearly the same hps. I have two warrior friends that have the same amount of aa's both geared in the same fasion and one is 400hp above me the other is 1.2khp above me (Granted he has a few 100hp items but overall very similar gear).<br />
2. SKs AC is less on ALL class specific armor. Look at ALL Velious armor, look at ANY Luclin class specific armor (If any), ALL Elemental armor. ALL AC is higher on the warrior armor.<br />
3. SKs have two types of DPS. Medium Sustained and Heavy Burst DPS. If you can't figure out the difference between the two go do some damned research.<br />

What about Crimson Darkscale/ Fulvous Darkscale? Many warrior are stuck with that Luclin armor, You picked the wrong race SK wise, they didn't pick a diety. Look at an EASY 5k+ hp Ogre SK, look at some of the warriors with 3300 hp magelo. You my friend are the one deluded, not me. Make a magelo for a Troll SK or an Ogre SK and equip them with this cultural armor, then make an Agnostic warrior with the best SS, warlord, champion mix. You will see what a flat out lie it is warriors have more hps. I don't even have one piece of Elemental armor, or a BoC, I never will. I do not raid 9 times a week and 7 days a week and that is REQUIRED on my server.<br />
Comparing yourself to an elemental armored warrior is a cloud of misconception that you are using. Compare an Elemental SK of the same race to a warrior and see the true difference.<br />
The fact is, I have hit the nail dead square on the head, and it is frightening the Knights because they know I am right. Sony will soon realize it too, and your little scam will be over.<br />

SK are perfectly balanced in the current state of the game. It's only warriors who are NOT broken, but need some tuning. About taunt, about mitigation difference about itemisation. I will not turn this thread into another one of the 585 proposal you can read on this board... but if you want my opinion, taunt need only some minor tuning, while SOE should concentrate on increasing our atractivity in groups with something different than the ability to aggro. <br />
Knights were always better at aggro, it's fine... but the counterpart we had is now relatively less important. <br />

So should you, they meant for it to be there, it should be there. They are just to stupid to add spell and pet DPS into the equation.

<br />
I'll not argue that it is somewhat disengenous.  However, let's consider this.  The Warrior is supposed to have certain advantages, correct?  Higher HP is supposed to be one of those advantages, as I understand it.  Yet this is one of those categories where a class advantage can be reduce or eliminated depending on gear.  Huh?  WTH is that?  Can the Paladin advantage of heals be reduced or eliminated by a Warrior with enough of the right gear?  Can the Shadow Knight advantage of dots be eliminated by a Warrior with enough of the right gear?  No, the Warrior can't reduce or eliminate these Knight advantages regardless of his gear.<br />
<br />
So why are all the Warrior advantages, except for defensive which I know someone would bring up, able to be reduced or eliminated if the Knight has better gear?  Where is the sense in that?  Where are our undisputed, unable to be eliminated, class advantages?</div></div><hr />

How would you go about removing the ability for a well geared paladin to not exceed a poorely geared warrior in HP/AC?<br />
<br />
I cannot even think of a way doesn't sound stupid.  Gear is gear.  Unless higher level gear had never dropped, and we all still wore fine plate, this is going to happen.  Unless you truly believe a 55th level warrior in banded should have more AC/HP then a 55th level knight in cultural.<br />
<br />
Comparing similarily equipped warriors with knights and ensuring the hp and ac spread is appropriate is the correct way of handling this.</div></div><hr />

 [/B] <br />
<br />
If it was only that easy, I think you are missing why warriors are having problems. <br />
<br />
We do have more hps.<br />
We do mitigate better.<br />
We do have better melee dps.<br />
We do have more AC.<br />
We do have BoC's, BF's, HG's, CHSD's...<br />
We have taunt at the highest skill.<br />
<br />
Does any of that matter?<br />
<br />
NO...<br />
<br />
Why?<br />
<br />
Because we are slaves to the RNG, even with max stats, we will never proc unless some RNG says we do.<br />
<br />
A Pal/SK wil 'proc' whenever they want to.<br />
<br />
When a mezzed mob is taunted, and we break mez, are we ever 100% sure that the mob will not charge the ENC and make elf-Patee? NO. When a Pal/SK roots/snares and stun breaks mez. want to guess where mob goes? nowhere...<br />
<br />
When a mob is racing  into camp and we fire an arrow for 20pts of damage, can we pull it off that tashing/slowing enc/shm? Hell no.. Does that pally with ranged stun? Yes...<br />
<br />
The problem is not with what we have, its that what we have is no longer relavent in the PoP game. <br />
<br />
The EXTREMELY MOST important aspect of tanking/exping in the PoP game is aggro control/ crowd control. If you are  using melee to kill, you must maintain aggro on one target. Doesnt matter really who that one target is, but one target is all that need healed. If you are not using melee, keeping the mob at range, root/snare etc is what is most important.<br />
<br />
I know it has been beaten to death, but the design of the mobs in PoP never took into account the design of the warrior and what we do. The high dps/ low hp mob is a great concept,  makes fights faster and deadlier. Also leads to zerg and less strategy (hello 200 person zergfest) but it completely closes the warrior and for most part melee classes out of the game.<br />
<br />
We cannot instantly and at will get aggro, so we do not qualify for the tanking aspect of exp in pop.<br />
<br />
We cannot realistically do good ranged dps, snare or root mobs, so we do not qualify for the CC aspect of exp in pop.<br />
<br />
All we are left doing is waiting on raids, tanking the big baddie with defensive, and calling it a night. <br />
<br />
Unless they DRAMATICALLY increase AC/HP/Mitigation to warriors, nothing will change. And by Dramatic, I mean make it a sizable difference. 500 hps is jack shit, 500 AC is virtually unnoticable. If a warrior does not have 2-3000 more hps than a knight it is not enough to really notice.  This will not happen...  The only way to change this is to give us controllable, on demand aggro. But the knights fear that. People say it will make encounters trivial, etc etc etc...<br />
<br />
If you want warriors fixxed... I would propose a few simple fixxes.<br />
<br />
<br />
1. HP's - All mana on gear is hp's to a warrior <br />
    --OR--<br />
    HP's - Warriors get a 25% premium on hp items.<br />
<br />
3. AC - give us the monk mitigation chart... LOL, seriouslly we need our own damage table. Perhaps if the DB of a mob was always 50% for a warrior?  This sounds like a very easy fix to implement<br />
<br />
4. Taunt - Give me a fail/success message. At least the impression that this works would comfort warriors egos.<br />
<br />
5. Taunt - Give me a range, It is kind of silly that I can be in melee range and NOT in taunt range. Taunt needs a range that scales up with skill? Maybe range equal to skill?<br />
<br />
6. Taunt give us real seperation in taunt skill. Cap it at 255 or 305.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">06-06-2003, 12:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just wanted to clarify something a few folks seem to be missing in the discussion of whether warriors have an AC/HP advantage over knights.  Yes, if a warrior and a knight are in comparable gear, the warrior has more HPs and AC.  That is not the issue. The debate is whether or not the difference is SIGNIFICANT and/or BALANCED when compared to the aggro Pal/Sk generate.  Should a 55 warrior in banded have more AC/HP than a 55 knight in cultural?...Obviously not.   Should a 55 knight casting a 9th level spell that has NO HOPE of working on a mob be able to out aggro a 55 Warrior with one if not two hate procs?...Again, obviously not.  The difference in the two scenarios is that one of them can and quite often does happen.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh, and for the record, most if not all of these look like good ideas:<br />

Glatius is right, the advantages of a warrior can easily be taken away with the right gear for the others...yet the opposite is not true.<br />

<br />
Speaking personally and not for the SK class, I wouldn't fear it if warriors had on-demand aggro.  I think something along those lines is needed, perhaps an innate aggro multiplier (class ability that is not an aa skill, unique to the WAR class) or something along those lines, where the mulitplier factor increases as the warrior levels.<br />
<br />
I really don't know what SOE can/will do to fix warriors, but I don't think breaking any other class is a good way to do it.<br />
<br />
Would it REALLY trivialize encounters to give warriors a healthy boost in aggro?  Sometimes I'm not so sure.</div></div><hr />

Warriors should get a better bonus out of their equipment. All other hybrids should only gain those bonuses through their deity and spell casting.<br />

At this pt , warriors are dumb and get absolutely no advantages from their equipment.<br />

Yes, our HP is higher than any other class.. do you know how much HP I gaiend at level 56 ? I gained like less than 50 HP. Do you know how easy it is to offset the base HP with gear ?<br />

The base HP of warriors really isn't much when the difference with other hybrids is so small and the gear at high end makes up for most of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">06-06-2003, 01:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Zevfeer is 10/tick (20/tick but you get 10/tick back), but then you have to add Aura of Hate.  It's 100 mana for every 72 seconds but I just called it 10/tick for the ease of computation.  Assuming KEI/VOQ is your only form of mana regen via buffs (very likely in XP groups), those two spells is enough to even keep a fairly uber SK from having spare mana to do anything else meaningful (SKs aren't exactly swimming in FT gear, even uber ones).  Without KEI/VOQ, a SK can't even keep his best two spells running full time.  That's why having SK doing damage with spells is ultimately pointless unless they don't have Aura of Hate (I'd hope they have Zevfeer's Bite).  Pretty much any caster can do more damage with an extra 10 mana/tick they get from Zevfeer than the SK could have.  Likewise the group 100+ attack buff from Aura of Hate far outdamages any spell damage the SK can dish out.  <br />
<br />
Warriors have Fierce Heraldric armor which has as much HP as anything buyable I know of.  FH is available to arguably a far larger portion of the gaming populace since the only requirement is your worship RZ (and a lot of warriors do).  On the other hand for the cultural armor you have to worship Cazic Thule and it's only for Ogre &amp; Trolls.  Certainly a RZ worshipping warrior has better option buyable options than a Troll/Ogre CT worshipping SK.  Yes if you picked Marr like me you're out of luck but that's just the way it is.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, I forgot, there's also Helanic Tundra armor.  That covers just about all Barbarians (Tribunal &amp; RZ covers just about all Bar warriors I think) and it even covers the weirdoes like the half elf Tribunal warriors out there.</div></div><hr />

SKs do MORE damage than a warrior, bottom line!<br />
Burst DPS, absolutely.  I have yet to see an intelligent SK deny that.  But sustained long-term DPS, with comparable weapons/levels/aa's, I would question.  Against some mob types a SK can do more long-term damage, against some they can't.  You're not exactly revealing any secrets here.<br />

Scam? Click me please, Rumblingdeth (http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=scam).  Ok, now that we're clear on what &quot;scam&quot; means, what the hell are you talking about?<br />
P.S. Aura of Hate is not overpowering, ask the SKs, they LOVE seeing warriors suck bad (like Paladins).<br />
Again, please allow me to say:   huh?  Let me try to understand that line... Aura of Hate[level 65 group atk buff] isn't overpowering because shadowknights and paladins like seeing warriors suck?  Sir, even if the latter part of that statement were true, it doesn't even make sense.  What does an atk buff have to do with problems the warrior class might have, or the enjoyment a hybrid might take therin?<br />
Take a look at the magelos added. I think the problem is obvious, SKs are way to close in hps<br />
So... since ogres have a huge hp advantage over gnomes and cultural armor was implemeneted (maybe) too good in comparison to Velious quest armor, that means SKs have too many hp?  I'm not saying you're wrong or right, as everyone's entitled to an opinion, but if you're going to try and prove anything, at least pick good examples.<br />
<br />
Like these:  65 SK (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=709154) vs. 65 warrior (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=709145).  Both are in elemental armor, same gear in non-armor spots, both with max hp aa's.  Now, if you want to argue that the spread isn't far enough between those two, feel free... at least it's an accurate comparison.<br />
<br />
Seriously, here's some advice... calm down, put your thoughts in a rational order, offer real proof, and stick to one post rather than 18 replies to yourself in a row.  Makes it much easier for people to read and understand, and maybe reply to with more than confusion.</div></div><hr />

It'll also cost him mana over time (I can't imagine a SK with significant mana regen without having Aura of Hate) so it means nothing on the long run effectiveness of a group.  You most certainly don't get a SK because he can nuke an extra whatever DPS on his limited mana bar.</div></div><hr />

Glatius, many class advantages can be reduced or even reversed by gear. How does a warrior with a BoW, 41% haste item, and capped +atk gear compare to a rogue with epic and a crystal grinder in raw DPS? Keep in mind much of that rogues' DPS is situational too.<br />
<br />
Back in luclin, there were many INT casters that had more unbuffed hp than I did as a paladin. Unless gear is meaningless, the worst equipped of a specialist class will be surpassed in their specialty by a well equipped member of another class, as long as gear supplies something that modifies that specialty. Hp and AC both modify tanking ability. Taunt procs modify taunting ability. <br />
<br />
I bet if a warrior had all the WAR usable right clickies he could likely self buff himself as well as - if not better than - a hybrid who has nothing but storebought spells.</div></div><hr />

Be realistic, be honest, don't try to fluff up the case.

A Rogue and a Warrior typically aren't in competition for the same spot in a group.  And the Rogue will still have back stab, something a Warrior will never have, regardless of gear.  Backstab is unique to the class.  No other class is going to get it.  With gear that is only close to what the Warrior has, the Rogue will still be doing more damage.<br />
<br />
Warriors get crap stuff like /shield and defensive as our unique class based advantages.  The rest can be neutralized by gear.  I would argue that in fact we have more areas of supposed advantage that can and are diluted by gear than any other class.  Can anyone compete with a Cleric's CH?  Even the other Priests can't quite compete, regardless of gear.  Can anyone compete with Monk FD?  Shadow Knights and Necros both get it, but it will never be as good a Monk's, no matter what gear.

I bet if a warrior had all the WAR usable right clickies he could likely self buff himself as well as - if not better than - a hybrid who has nothing but storebought spells.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Where are these right clickies you're speaking of, Graal? Cobalt armor?!?! Lesser shielding, strength of the kunzar and, um, oh, right: serpent sight. Not sure if there are any 45+ hybrids who would trade their self buffs for those 3.<br />
<br />
Maybe you're thinking of tinkered stuff? Let's see, the +ATK from a telescope is, um, right. Zero.<br />
<br />
What am I missing, and how much more do they cost in the bazaar then a Symbol spell from an NPC vendor?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Graal the Dorf</div><div class="date">06-06-2003, 05:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A Rogue and a Warrior typically aren't in competition for the same spot in a group. And the Rogue will still have back stab, something a Warrior will never have, regardless of gear. Backstab is unique to the class. No other class is going to get it. With gear that is only close to what the Warrior has, the Rogue will still be doing more damage.<br />
<br />
Warriors get crap stuff like /shield and defensive as our unique class based advantages. The rest can be neutralized by gear. I would argue that in fact we have more areas of supposed advantage that can and are diluted by gear than any other class. Can anyone compete with a Cleric's CH? Even the other Priests can't quite compete, regardless of gear. Can anyone compete with Monk FD? Shadow Knights and Necros both get it, but it will never be as good a Monk's, no matter what gear. How about mend? Monk only, no one gets as good with gear. Get the point or must I go on?<br />
<br />
A poorly equipped rogue will still have backstab, true. That's not the point. The purpose of backstab is to add damage output. The well equipped warrior is going to outdamage that poorly equipped rogue IN SPITE of backstab. The same can be said of a very well equipped rogue and a very poorly equipped warrior. The rogue will still tank most things better (if he has a large enough gap in hp) than the warrior will even though the warrior has defensive. The skill itself isn't the important thing, it is the effect that the skill produces. <br />
<br />
I would also argue that mend is not a very good example. Let's take a poorly equipped monk and assume he has about 3.5k hp and can med every 6?7? minutes. The monk can heal himself for about 875 hp every 6 or so minutes. A warrior with a cobalt BP can heal himself for hp in that same amount of time. The cobalt BP definitely has some downsides compared to mend, I won't argue that.<br />
<br />
CH is a good example of your point, but any other heal is not.  When you consider a shaman with items that give FT 15, improved healing focus that increase the amount healed by 30%, mana efficiency focus that reduce mana expenture by at least 10% (only one I know about, and surely the weakest one) and spell casting haste focus, that shaman's best non CH heal is almost as good as the best cleric non CH heal unmodifed by any items. That doesn't actually take into account the benefit of the FT gear, which does change things. If the shaman had the proper AAs and the cleric none, the shaman heal would actually be slightly more efficient than the cleric heal, with the chance of the shaman getting a crit heal.  <br />
<br />
The point is, a well equipped X is sometimes going to be better at most tasks than a poorly equipped Y.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I get 300hp/33AC/30MR from right clicking my BP... that's pretty damn substantial if I'm not grouped with a Shaman.   I also get quite a sizeable damage shield going as well.    <br />
<br />
Now, having said that, warriors dont' corner the market in right clickies, and most of what I have is quite usable by many classes, but I really like my shield of the Arcane a lot.</div></div><hr />

Is it fair that the Dev's made cultural armor without thinking of the impact it would have on the game? NO<br />
<br />
I don't have a BoC, and most warriors won't. What I see on this board is the Housewife who plays EQ 16 hours a day with no regard to anything else. Let me repeat, you don't have 150AA's, play 7 days a week/raid 9 times a week, you will NOT guild in the guilds to get the stuff you NEED to play this game. Or you will look like those magelo's. I have not been past NToV, most haven't! Why not? The CASTERS don't want to do anything past that! They whine about faction, they whine they want more loot. Wel, guess what? Their are so many freaking level 65's in this game all guilds are zergs or you have a bunch of pissed off 65's with the magelo's I listed.<br />
<br />
Besides which, when a player retires he SELLS his warrior! My room mate is playing 24/7/365 and has all the Uber loot. He BOUGHT his warrior and is MA for the guild. Half the chars in this game have been sold/bought. Many warriors are twinks of retired casters. The top will fill with warriors and we come back to the magelo's I listed, your average player.<br />
<br />
Can someone with an AVERAGE Magelo speak? I have a BoC (it is worth $650 on playerauctions btw) is NOT the one representing 90% of us!!!!!! Equipment is NOT the answer, and if Sony makes it the answer (as they have) WoW is gonna kick their butts! I am already bad mouthing the game. So what, well lets trace it out:<br />
1. I got a friend to play<br />
2. He got a friend to play<br />
3. He got two friends to play....<br />
Or<br />
1. I bad mouth the game to five people (play 24/7 or fall hopelessly behind)<br />
2. The five tell five more &quot;everyone who plays EQ is a hopeless addict...&quot;<br />
3. They come to WoW (I tell them to wait for WoW now)<br />
<br />
BTW Roomies expenditures:<br />
60th warrior $350<br />
SoD $400<br />
RZ Helm $250<br />
<br />
Thats BS to play a game just to keep up. Only the Officers/Guild leaders get loot in Uber guilds on the older servers. The answer is not equipment, there should not be 100% difference between similiar level warriors but there is. That actually means EQ itself at the base is broken, that means anyone who can't keep up has to sell. When there is no one left but the no life's playing the servers will shut down. That time is closer than most think, because of broken itemization.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I made a Troll SK an Ogre Warrior (Already deleted them since someone made the very point Im going to make right now and I dont feel like remaking them just to prove you wrong again). <br />
<br />
Both level 65 both using the same non show items (except weapons). <br />
<br />
The Warrior had Warlord armor and the SK had Crimson Darkscale armor (RZ cultural for trolls). <br />
<br />
The warrior had a bone-bladed warhammer and the red epic (Both relatively powerful agro weapon).<br />
<br />
SK using War Marshall's Bladed Staff.<br />
<br />
Ogre War had around 20pts of sta above the SK. Plus the SK had far lower INT then any SK player would allow their char to get.<br />
<br />
In the end:<br />
Warrior's Hp: 5k+<br />
SK's Hp: 4k+<br />
<br />
War Atk: 1200+<br />
SK Atk: 1100 <br />
<br />
War AC: 1249<br />
SK AC: 1229<br />
<br />
As you can see the differences in hp is staggering, the atk difference is moderate while the ac difference isint all that high.<br />
Also the SK's mana pool was super low because I was using tanking items instead of mana/int adding items, meaning he couldn't burst dps for very long at all to keep up with any warrior.<br />
<br />
Now that I've used your exact specifications and SHOWN you how much higher warrior's are then SKs (Or even Paladins for this matter) are in the hp department, hell even the atk department, what bullshit are you going to spout now I wonder.</div></div><hr />

Fantastic.  That has exactly what to do with the topic on hand?<br />
Thats BS to play a game just to keep up.<br />
I agree.  The funny part(to me at least, and I'd assume others) is, he CHOSE to do that rather than just earn the stuff himself.  No where does EverQuest or Sony force you to spend $1000 on a character.  That was solely your roommate's decision.<br />
<br />
But again, this really has nothing to do with anything, let alone the topic of this thread.<br />
Only the Officers/Guild leaders get loot in Uber guilds on the older servers.<br />
100% incorrect, and yet again, has nothing to do with knights or aggro.<br />
The answer is not equipment, there should not be 100% difference between similiar level warriors but there is.

That time is closer than most think, because of broken itemization.  <br />
Well, itemization is almost on the right topic, I guess.  <br />
<br />
Basically, you're trying to say that buy implementing end-game gear to actually seperate the raiders from the casuals, this somehow facilitates the need to eBay, and therefore the game is broken.  Did I get that right?<br />
BTW, You accuse me of making misleading magelo's?<br />
No, the magelo's aren't misleading at all.  The assumptions you leap to and try to get everyone else to believe based upon them are.  You're comparing warrior to shadowknight, one of the better sets of cultural armor to Velious quest, AND ogre to gnome, all in an effort to say shadowknight's have too many hp compared to warriors.  Whether you're wrong or right, there are FAR too many variables in that multi-faceted comparison for it to be taken seriously.  Compare realistic examples.  <br />
<br />
About all you really did was prove that an ogre shadowknight(generally considered the highest hp sk) needs to sacrifice their mana pool(i.e. damage/utility) substantially in favor of hp gear, only to still have 50hp less a gnomish warrior(generally considered one of the weaker tank races, perhaps just stereotypically).  Are you sure that's what you wanted to prove?</div></div><hr />

1. The reason I stopped at NToV is because no &quot;casual&quot; player can get past it on 95% of the servers due to it being a giant time sink past there (keys, competetion, etc)<br />

If you look at both innate and right click effects, a non melee gets much better effects through his gear than a hybrid could hope to get from self buffs without dropped spells as I mentioned above. Am I saying that's unbalanced? No, I am not. Many classes get the benefits of right click items and innate effects. The point I am trying to make is that you simply cannot balance classes without taking into account their gear.<br />
<br />
Shield of the arcane: 300hp, 36 AC, 30 MR<br />
Aura of X petals: 50 to X resist<br />
Bramblecoat: 19 AC, 3 DS<br />
Marvelous Visions: 50 STA, 30% haste<br />
Frostreaver's Blessing: 10hp/tick regen, 10 DS, 10 ATK<br />
Grim aura: 10 ATK<br />
Obscure: 13 AC<br />
Plainsight: see invis, ultravision<br />
Shield of Flame: 9 DS, 15 FR<br />
Silver Skin: 150 point rune<br />
Spirit of Wolf<br />
Strength of the Kunzar: 25 STR<br />
Icicle Aura: 6 DS<br />
Yaulp 2: 20 STR, 9 AC, decrease STA loss by 1<br />
invis<br />
shrink<br />
<br />
300hp in buffs<br />
150 rune<br />
50 STA - at just 6hp/STA that's another 300 hp<br />
45 STR<br />
77 AC<br />
30% haste<br />
10hp/tick regen<br />
28 DS<br />
20 atk<br />
30 MR<br />
15 FR<br />
+50 to any resist from aura of X petals<br />
<br />
For those who think gear isn't the end all, be all of EQ, wake up. That list doesn't take into account any innate effects, just right clicks that don't use charges. It all stacks. If you add in +250 atk, innate regen, innate haste, and all the other innate effects on gear it makes it obvious how big of an effect gear has.</div></div><hr />

Paranoid much?  Cultural armor was added in part to make tradeskills more worthwhile.  RZ and Tribunal cultural are both awesome armor sets.  Agnostics and members of some religions did to a certain extent get shafted(I am agnostic, and do regret it), but overall, warrior cultural armor did not break warriors.<br />

4. Druids get talked to, no matter how stupid these &quot;kiters&quot; are because they raise hell. Paladins threw a FIT about nerfing slay undead (broken) and it has not been nerfed. <br />

Name calling will get no one anywhere.  Druids do have it good, but that does not meen they do not have class issues, and that SoE should talk to them.  In fact SoE should talk to all classes, and I hope(tho I am not holding my breath) that they will talk to us too.  Druids can solo in many ways, but tend to have a hard time getting groups.  I know several druids who prefer to group who have pretty much givin up, as group invites are so rare.  This is to a certain extent a legitimate issue for them.<br />
<br />
6. It is time for WARRIORS (not ones posing as warriors) to DEMAND taunt be improved to the point we can almost lock aggro as a SK or Paladin can or nerf them so they can't do it. <br />

I agree to this to a point.  I do think that part of the issue that is keeping them from fixing us is finding a way to do it that keeps knights viable as exp group tanks, and keeps the game as a whole balanced.  I would hope(tho am sceptical) that Absor and the devs would come and talk to us(like they just did for druids) and ask us for ideas.</div></div><hr />

While I agree with you for the most part, you need to at least mention that many of those right clicks are overwritten by common group buffs, as well as some of them not stacking with one another, also that almost all of those right clicks aren't warrior only, or even melee only, so just as people shouldn't undersell them, they also shouldn't be oversold.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is what hybrids have been saying since Kunark, just replace the phrase &quot;right click&quot; with &quot;hybrid class X&quot;.<br />
<br />
as well as some of them not stacking with one another <br />
<br />
They all stack. That is why I used that list and not the other 50 or so effects that are available to warriors on gear as right clicks.<br />
<br />
also that almost all of those right clicks aren't warrior only<br />
<br />
You are right. I specifically said that I don't see it as a class balance thing. The game is based far too much on gear for balancing to be done without comparing different classes in equal level gear, is all I'm saying.<br />
<br />
BTW, a warrior with those right clicks (only has to equip them long enough to right click em - the yaulp mask would require constant wear, but that's it) and max innate +atk gear, max innate +regen, max innate DS, etc. would have far, FAR more effects from his gear than a hybrid without any of that could self buff himself, even with dropped spells. The only category that is not true for is hp.<br />
<br />
+250 innate atk plus 20 attack from right clicks. I don't know how much a ranger can self buff his atk, but 359 displayed atk is a hell of a lot. I doubt a ranger could self buff themselves to have nearly as high of a DS.<br />
<br />
The same can be said of a warrior with very little +hp gear compared to a knight who averages +100hp per slot.<br />
<br />
You simply can not balance those extremes of gear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So if a Warrior had every click item available in the game he might possibly rival the buff potential of the common every day, never been on a raid in his life, Paladin.  Groovey.  Of course he couldn't share these buffs with anyone else, unlike the majority of the Paladin buffs, so they're much more limited in that respect.  And this doesn't address the fact that the Paladin could gain pretty much the exact same items and buff himself the exact same way.<br />
<br />
And the Warrior still wouldn't hold aggro like a Paladin with bazaar purchased gear.  And the Warrior still wouldn't heal like a Paladin with bazaar purchased gear.  And the Warrior still wouldn't be able to root or stun, like a Paladin with bazaar purchased gear.<br />
<br />
So where the hell is our &quot;no one else can do it or do it as well even if they have the best gear in the game&quot; abilities?  Oh yeah, /shield and defensive.

<br />
Back on topic, argo is busted both ways. The hp advantage while looking good on paper doesn't ammount to a whole lot in the day to day setting the majority of 60+ warriors live,  where our problems overshadow our gains compared to the other two tank classes. It does start to mean something in the raid setting, as such i'd have to say that portion of the game is in most cases working decently. <br />
<br />
Do you spend every moment of your time raiding? I'd guess to say 80% of the eq population doesn't even spend a third of their time on a raid situation, so what is left? Xp time - where most warriors are frustrated at their ability to simply be the tank.<br />

I found the warrior boards on a crosslink on the state of the Warrior in SoL or one of those posts nearly a year? dunno more like 8 or 10 months ago i'd guess ago... There was some information that some people said that I disagreed with....<br />

I post here more because this board has the most amount of posters/posts that talk about the actual mechanics about how tanking works. Many arnt even warriors but it the information resides on these boards, so I post here.<br />
<br />
And If i happen to see something I disagree, or is flat out wrong I'll post, it really doesnt matter what class I am except for the fact that I possess more knowledge about my class, and less about others...<br />

Probably not, Brael would have banned you faster then he banned Bick. But I DO know alot of other people that don't even play SKs that read the board. It's called gaining knowledge.

One, SKs have already been nerfed and nerfed pretty damned hard. Not to sure if the Pallies have fealt this or not yet.<br />
<br />
Two, nerfing another class only makes your raids weaker, not stronger. It's best to go about improving yourselves instead of looking at another class and saying &quot;God I wish we could do that, but since we can't lets nerf them so they can't either&quot;.<br />
<br />
Three, Im not sure if you know this or not but SKs and Paladins are TANKS. Let me spell that out for you...T...A...N...K...S. Meaning they fall under the same job classification as warriors. Warriors are meant to be better in some aspects of it while Knights are better at others.</div></div><hr />

What does this mean? It means While they are Tanks and Casters, they are NOT supposed to be better than either a PURE tank or a PURE caster.<br />

Does anyone disagree with the following?<br />
<br />
A Paladin should never be better than healing than a Cleric (pure healer)<br />

A SK should never be a better caster than a Necro (pure caster)<br />
<br />
How about these?<br />

A Pal should never be a better tank than a Warrior (pure tank)<br />
A Sk should never be a better tank than a Warrior (pure tank)<br />

<br />
Pre-PoP SKs and Paladins were in the exact same boat as Warriors are in right now. From an SK point of view, we lacked dps, we lacked hps and AC, we were exactly as you said. Tanks but not as good as a warrior. This went on for literally years. Many many MANY SKs quit the game because everyone thought VI/SoE just forgot about their bastard redheaded step child SK class.<br />
<br />
When PoP was introduced and extreme agro became a neccesity, the SK class was shoved into the spot light. Not because of anything we did (God knows they never listened to us in the first place). But because Sony decided to make mobs hit for 500-800 a pop in yard trash, and you needed agro on a tank instantly. Which both the SK and Paladins filled that roll extremely well.<br />
<br />
We've had our agro spells since the day beta was released (Darkness series+Disease Cloud. Terror line is merely a sad replacement for DC). We've had this agro power all along, but since it was never needed to such an extreme level, no one really cared. <br />
<br />
But now I find it sort of funny that people want the SKs and Paladins nerfed when we've had this sort of agro control since beta, instead of trying to fix the warrior class.</div></div><hr />

I agree in principle - but what is your definition of tanking?  Knights should not mitigate as well as a warrior.  Warrior's should have less aggro then a knight.  I will not mention how wide the gap's should be, mainly because I don't know.<br />
<br />
Aggro management for a hybrid encompasses both of our sides.  We get the nasty RNG taunt and we get our spells.  Knights true aggro advantage comes directly from our spell casting side.  I do agree (and have been in many an argument on the PoN) that our spells should stop being effective after xx levels.  But, all that does is make us have to work a bit harder, we will still have superior aggro at the cost of more mana.  Other knights call it a nerf, I call it a fix.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cuedyen2</div><div class="date">06-08-2003, 08:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Paladins threw a FIT about nerfing slay undead (broken) and it has not been nerfed.<br />
<br />
Yes, we threw a fit because the penalty did not fit the crime.  And we did not get the AA un-nerfed, we got Sony to change the nerf to something that was not as devastating.  Hell, I remember Frodlin (believe it was you) posting on the board wondering why we wanted our change, since in his eyes our proposal was more of a nerf then Sony's.<br />
<br />
Speaking of Frodlin and Glatius, have not seen you two on PoN much lately.  There is a thread in the General Section about shield/block that Gilfalas has an intersting idea.  I think most of us *sane* paladins avoid the class balancing (rant) section now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only viable arguement Knights have for better aggro control than a Warrior is to counter balance the Warrior's better tanking so that both are about equally attractive to a group.  Regardless of whether or not the Knights have always had better aggro control, this was not an intentional designed in function of the class, it was a fortunate side effect they reaped from the effects of spells from one of their parent classes.  No one at SoE sat down and said, hey lets design in better aggro control for the Knights, unlike mend for Monks, as an example.  Eventually they seem to have embraced the concept, but they didn't come up with it, they just accepted what came to be.<br />
<br />
Since the Warrior's better tanking is no longer significant enough to make the class about equally attractive to a group, Knights having aggro control to the level they do is no longer justifiable.  It doesn't balance any more, it over balances.  So, something somewhere has to change.  I don't in general advocate nerfs.  I don't particularly think nerfing Knights is likely.  I don't really think nerfing Knights will make the game more fun for Warriors.  So I think that nerfing Knights is probably one of the worse options.  However, there is really only so much they can do given how very limited they have made the Warrior class in it's functionality.<br />
<br />

<br />
I'm not posting on PoN much because Gilfalas has basically requested that I, and Frodlin for that matter, not post arguements counter to the suggestions Paladins are coming up with for their improvements.  Some Paladins are interested in having better disciplines than they currently do.  I've pointed out that disciplines aren't really as useful as they seem to think and that the class is doing damn well atm.  They're not interested.  Some Paladins want the /shield ability.  I've pointed out that it's the only thing of interest that Warriors have gotten since Kunark, and why do Paladins always seem to want to snag all the good Warrior abilities and are unwilling to allow the class some individuality?  Are Warriors trying to snag LoH?<br />
<br />
From my perspective Paladins are currently riding the gravy train and rather than realizing that, some are still insisting that they need help.  Hell, I even got into an arguement with a pretty lame 58 Paladin who insisted he had to use his 200 mana stun spell to hold aggro and therefore Paladins are always LoM, even after I pointed him to several PoN threads where many level 60+ Paladins explained how with Cease and Desist, they can hold aggro outstandingly for less than 100 mana per mob.</div></div><hr />

You will always have idiots from every class not understanding balance.  I do think, for the most part, that paladins do understand there is an imbalance.  However, I also understand why many threads get started on how to fix certain abilities - it is a paladin board afterall.  <br />
<br />
As far as the /shield thread.  If my memory serves me, shortly before SoL came out, /shield was an idea first mentioned on the PoN as something knights could bring to a group.  At that time, we were in dire need of help and it was an idea of how to get tanking to stack.  Of course, with the release of PoP - we no longer need help and it is the warrior's who now do.<br />
<br />
this was not an intentional designed in function of the class<br />
<br />
Actually, I think it was intentional.  I believe they wanted us (as in hybrids) to have to watch our spellcasting so that we did not strip aggro from the tank (be it a warrior or another knight).  That was suppossed to keep us from using our spells all of the time.  I remember groups back in KC where I would have to really watch my heal spells so that I did not wind up with aggro.  It really used to be frustrating, knowing you were a tank/healer but you could use neither in a groups effectively because using the secondary upset the group when you got aggro.</div></div><hr />

I was the one who was mystified over why you guys ever saw the proposed slay change as a nerf.  To this day I'll never understand it, ever.   They proposed to give you what us crazy warriors have been begging for for some time, and you howled in protest over it.<br />
<br />
Let's go down the proposed change....<br />
<br />
1. Slay Undead was to increase in damage relative to player level<br />
<br />
2. To receive that enhancement, you would've had to be in &quot;slay mode&quot;<br />
<br />
3. &quot;Slay Mode&quot; decreased your defense by an unknown amount.<br />
<br />
In essence, the proposed change said &quot;You would have an option to do significantly more damage while not tanking, or remain tanking and not do the damage&quot;.  <br />
<br />
For MONTHS warriors have been asking for a &quot;slider&quot; that allowed them to go into DPS mode or defense mode... Bzzzt!    DENIED!   You're given the opportunity, and Paladins across Norrath turned it down.<br />
<br />
It's POSSIBLE that they did so because their version of using slay at the time was generally solo, and they took it as a &quot;nerf to soloing undead&quot;, although the whole soloing thing went out the window with PoP for melee for the most part.<br />
<br />
It's also POSSIBLE that they wanted the whole enchilada with no drawbacks (I tend to believe it was a combination of both quite frankly).   They didnt' want to not tank, and didn't want to give up on SU hits if they were tanking.   Of course, the complaints about not having anything besides tanking to do in exp groups at this point kind of really pisses me off because they'd have easily had SU spots, so long as they werent' tanking.   <br />
<br />
As soon as you see Paladinskar... err Veksar, you'll see why this was done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">06-08-2003, 02:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">However, I also understand why many threads get started on how to fix certain abilities - it is a paladin board afterall. <br />
<br />
Of course, this is perfectly reasonable.  But then some low brain, big mouth Paladin starts spouting off about how this or that should be for Paladins and how Paladins need to all have a big red S painted on their chests and be able to do it all, solo even!  And they should get a cookie too!.  Or they go on about how unloved, unwanted, shuned, spit on, how the girls all hate them and won't give them the time of day!  It tends to bring out the, huh, wtf are you thinking??!! in me.<br />
<br />
As far as the /shield thread. If my memory serves me, shortly before SoL came out, /shield was an idea first mentioned on the PoN as something knights could bring to a group. At that time, we were in dire need of help and it was an idea of how to get tanking to stack. Of course, with the release of PoP - we no longer need help and it is the warrior's who now do.<br />
<br />
And my recollection was it was posted here on the steelewarrior first and got cross posted to PoN and discussed as an interesting idea.  I still see it as something all tank classes could use, except for the fact that Warriors have gotten jack and shit in the last three expansions while the Knights have gotten some nice improvements, including new spells.  So just on the principle of enough is enough, I'm against Knights getting it.<br />
<br />
Actually, I think it was intentional. I believe they wanted us (as in hybrids) to have to watch our spellcasting so that we did not strip aggro from the tank (be it a warrior or another knight). That was suppossed to keep us from using our spells all of the time.<br />
<br />
I see it as unintentional, you see it as intentional but intended to have a negative impact.  Regardless, it was not intended to be the boon to Knights that it is currently.  That was not ever the intention.  It has become a point of balance, I grant, but there is no inalienable right for major over the top Knight aggro control.  The only jusitifiable reason for Knights to have MORE aggro control is that they have LESS tanking.  However the differences in tanking are not only smaller, they're less meaningful than ever before.  While aggro control has gone from being a nice thing to have to something absolutely required.<br />
<br />
So we're in agreement there is an out of balance condition.  Where we disagree is how it ought to be addressed and to what degree.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I still am and will always be /boggled over the whole Slay Undead thing.  Here paladins had a chance to, while fighting undead, be given the choice to be turned from a defensive class into an offensive class.  Instead they'd rather have no drawbacks to getting the Slay Undead AA.  Hehe, paladins are really the only class I know of other than druids that would willingly turn something like that down, I know warriors would jump on it in a second, as would pretty much any defensive class.  But then again I've noticed many paladins would rather be a warrior with stuns and heals than a paladin.<br />
<br />
/boggles the mind, I swear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grhar</div><div class="date">06-08-2003, 07:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Knights should not be better tanks than warriors.  Ever.  It really is the same as druids being better healers than clerics.  Or shit, for that matter, paladins being better healers than clerics.  Paladins are HYBRIDS.  Shadowknights are HYBRIDS.  Warriors are TANKS.  Paladins and Shadowknights sacrifice some of their tanking ability for spells / skills / abilities from their other parent classes, clerics &amp; necromancers.  That is how they are balanced.<br />
<br />
To reiterate, hybrids have not been the &quot;kings of agro since beta&quot; as several knights have implied in this thread.  Hybrids had an advantage in burst agro, Warriors had an advantage in sustained agro.  A warrior simply accumulated more agro in pure melee dual wielding ykeshas than a knight using an equivalent weapon such as a Mithril Two-Hander.  The only way a knight could close the gap and surpass the warrior was to drain their mana pool.  So a knight was a better tank in an emergency &quot;get the mob off the cleric now&quot; situation, and a warrior was better in a controlled environment.<br />
<br />
Nowadays, knights are better in emergency situations AND controlled environments.  Knights are not only better in burst agro, they are much better in sustained agro.  Knights are much better pullers:  feign death speaks for itself, but have you seen how effective the lull/pacify line is?  Man, they really upgraded these spells... single pulling a room of 5 blues is trivial for a paladin.  And is it worth mentioning all the other utility functions a knight brings to a group over a warrior?<br />
<br />
Warriors should be able to generate as much agro as a paladin who casts Cease every 20 seconds.  A level 65 paladin with moderate mana regen could cast this spell every 20 seconds easily and not dent their mana pool.  Maybe a button to push that generates 100 hate, which refreshes every 20 seconds?  I guess shadowknights could retain a slight edge in agro ability, because quite frankly, paladin utility is far more valuable than shadowknight utility... and maybe shadowknights need to maintain an edge in sustainable agro control over warriors for the sake of retaining balance.<br />
<br />
This is most definitely a grass is greener post.  And let me tell you, the grass is really as green as you think it might be.  I felt that warriors were broken back in October, but I am certain that they are broken now that I am playing an untwinked paladin on Stromm.<br />
<br />
Give warriors a 20 second refresh button to push.  Give it a name like &quot;Provoke&quot;, and let it add a fixed amount of hate equivalent to Cease.  The skill becomes available at level 60, the same level that enchanters get KEI.  Give warriors &amp; paladins equivalent sustained agro, and let paladins retain their advantage in burst agro.  The rankings would look something like:<br />
<br />
Sustained Agro<br />
1)  Shadowknights<br />
2)  Paladins / Warriors<br />
<br />
Burst Agro<br />
1)  Shadowknights / Paladins<br />
2)  Warriors<br />
<br />
Tanking (Mitigation Ability &amp; Hit Points)<br />
1)  Warriors<br />
2)  Shadowknights / Paladins<br />
<br />
Utility<br />
1)  Paladins<br />
2)  Shadowknights<br />
3)  Warriors<br />
<br />
DPS<br />
1)  Shadowknights w/ Pet<br />
2)  Warriors<br />
3)  Shadowknights w/o Pet<br />
4)  Paladins<br />
<br />
Something has to change soon.  The new expansion will likely broaden this gap as knights have always been the superior tank in dungeon crawls.  Utility and burst agro become much more important than efficient mitigation in unstable environments.<br />

<br />
I must respectfully disagree.  My paladin, since level 15 or so, could always (I started sometime between Kunark and Velious) pull aggro off anyone with a heal or two.  It did not take the full mana bar.  It did take more then it does today, but that is not only due to our spells but also to the other screwup - KEI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grhar</div><div class="date">06-08-2003, 09:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm basing my opinion predominantly on groups with rogues pre-evade.  The only way a paladin could keep a mob's back to the rogue was stuns or using proximity with root.  If you were the puller and MT, you never really had the mana to do more than one stun/root per mob... and this was often not enough.  Very very frustrating, and I'm glad rogues finally got evade.<br />
<br />
My rogue friends said it was easier (pre-evade) to get backstabs in with a warrior tank.  DPS was more important for agro back when mana was more of a luxury.  And dual wield completely trumped 2H for damage.<br />
<br />
The situation worsened in Kunark, and then began to improve via hybrid upgrades, which started a couple of months before SoV was released.  By the time we were halfway through Luclin, knights had a massive advantage in ability to maintain agro, and this fact became imbalancing once experience mobs start meleeing the casters in your group for 500+ a pop.<br />
<br />
Warriors are now obsolete.  Giving warriors the same sustainable agro as paladins would not break the class.  Paladins have an entire toolbox in the form of burst agro, roots, non-damage stuns, fast casting heals, group heals, brells, lay hands, single pulls with pacify, etc.  You pick a paladin tank over a warrior, those are your perks.  You pick a warrior over a paladin, you get more hit points, higher mitigation, and additional DPS.  Sustained agro should be equivalent, regardless of which tank you choose.</div></div><hr />

Knights have owned aggro from beta....  its just never really been worth anything as knights have been thrown to the curb as &quot;useless hybrids&quot; for so long...  these pointless whinefests prove time after time that warriors know dang near NOTHING about knights...  and just don't want to know any more than they think they need to whine for insane changes.<br />
<br />
Gladius... you might have noticed I actually DID say that I wasn't an expert on Paladin stun aggro... my point was that the warriors whining about it knew nothing as well.  I wasn't pretending to be an expert, unlike nearly the whole of warrior-whine-dom.  I advise you to read posts before making a fool of yourself.<br />
<br />

Not ONE warrior has shown the willingness to parse, to look at facts, and to find an imbalance other than.. &quot;I SAW this paladin do &quot;x&quot;.... <br />
<br />
If thats fair...  then I have seen warriors OWN aggro in groups with 200+ AAXP rogues, rangers, and wizards...  they own aggro like a champ...<br />
<br />
Okay... I've seen the opposite... wheres the response?<br />
<br />
<br />
Warriors DO have issues... most knights agree, but this whole &quot;im useless&quot; and &quot;poor me&quot; thing is so far from the truth as to be rediculous.  <br />
<br />
EVERY knight knows what warrior aggro is like... they see it every time they go OOM.  I can keep aggro with only my war-useable 2H and my lower-capped TAUNT skill.... why the hell can't you?  <br />
<br />
Yes, its less efficient than my spells...  yes, its not as immediate... yes, the shaman actually takes a hit...  no, he doesnt die, and no the enchanter doesn't either.  The group adjusts.<br />
<br />
I have never refused a warrior due to having a knight available...<br />
I have never seen it happen either, despite my latenight gaming making pickup grouping more of a commonplace thing than most experienced players would prefer.<br />
Why is it all the Warriors who are LFG &quot;all the time&quot; can't see the knights right next to them?<br />
<br />
<br />
IN even my opinion,  warriors COULD use minor changes to numerical hate addition...<br />
<br />
A simple +(level*3)hate to every kick whether it hits or misses would do the trick.<br />
<br />
The intelligent warrior would do what every Shadowknight has taught their newest members since the early days...<br />
<br />
Hit TAUNT then throw +hate.<br />
<br />
Even newbie warriors could handle the whole TAUNT then KICK combo.<br />
<br />
Then warriors could hold aggro over time whether they had EB items or not.  Then Knights would STILL be the kings of burst aggro.  Then no nerf is necessary to anything as warriors would NOT be overpowered even in the high end.<br />
<br />
When Warriors have aggro like knights, there truly is no reason to have knights along as our spells become parlor tricks...  Knight strengths have always been hard to understand.. hard to comprehend, and even harder to get groups to see.<br />
<br />
If a  warrior's hate generation approaches a knights...<br />
why take a knight when you can have a warrior with 10-15%more HP and useful disciplines??  For 200 pt heals (100 mana) every 60 seconds?  For a group heal you don't need?  for ROOT when dang near every caster in the group including the 'much appreciated&quot; enchanter and cleric can cast it?  For a snare that breaks mez constantly for 2 minutes?  Oh come on...  we both know that most warriors understand the knights' spellbooks about as well as they understand knights...  dang near nothing at all.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have absolutely no trouble competing with warriors for group slots...  I have a REAL problem of having to go back to the days of Kunark when knights had to fight to be considered worth the lag they caused by existing...<br />
<br />
Most warriors SAY they don't want knights useless...  yet much of what you propose would be just plain WRONG...  most of it due to the fact warrior understanding of +hate is as extensive as their numerous abilities that cause it....  and that would be NOTHING.<br />
<br />
This is a problem in more than one way.<br />
<br />
/sigh<br />
<br />
Will anyone actually stop whining and think about it?<br />

Until you see warriors asking for the exp penalty to be put back, you'll never see Kunark again, so stop the hypoerbolae</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grhar</div><div class="date">06-09-2003, 01:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Your rogue friend probably grouped with knights about as much as anyone else back then... ALMOST NEVER. <br />
<br />
Actually had a rogue in my regular group back when I played my paladin in 1999.  Logged in 55 days played before Kunark was released, and I'd say I spent hundreds of those hours trying to keep a mob's back to the rogue.<br />
<br />
Knights have owned aggro from beta.... its just never really been worth anything as knights have been thrown to the curb as &quot;useless hybrids&quot; for so long <br />
<br />
You realize KEI wasn't around during beta right?  And I am assuming that spells did cost mana during beta.  So how exactly was a paladin supposed to chain stuns to lockdown agro like they can today?  Short answer, they couldn't.  And speaking of &quot;useless hybrids&quot;... the reason we had the whole Kunark fiasco was because pure melee was so underpowered.  The class hardest hit in Kunark was arguable one of the most powerful originally:  rangers.  I still remember them being called &quot;Brad's Pet Class&quot;.<br />
<br />
Does anyone actually have any proof <br />
<br />
And what proof do you have?<br />
<br />
Not all Warriors are useless.. not all warriors are outdated... not all warriors are obsolete. I have warrior guildies approaching 10k HP who tank like no knight ever could... hold aggro nearly as well, and who dish WHILE TANKING as well as most Paladins can from behind. <br />
<br />
Great!  The top 0.1% of warriors are fine!  I quit my warrior the day after I got my Blade of Carnage.  I still couldn't hold agro and had no utility.  I was a tank who couldn't tank.  Yeah I had a lot of hit points, but the wizard in my group didn't, and it sure would have been nice if I could have done something while he was getting the beat down after his 2nd nuke (like stun / heal him / root mob / use lay hands).  So I traded in my obsolete car for one with more buttons &amp; features.  And one that is actually functional at high levels outside of a raid.<br />
<br />
Not ONE warrior has shown the willingness to parse, to look at facts, and to find an imbalance other than.. &quot;I SAW this paladin do &quot;x&quot;.... <br />
<br />
This might shock you, but several warriors have experience playing paladins.  I know Glatius has mentioned he has a paladin alt.  A paladin was my primary class for the first 2 years of EQ, and a warrior for the past 2 years.  I've also played my guildmate's paladin at a few raids &amp; camps.  It's not rocket science friend.<br />
<br />
If thats fair... then I have seen warriors OWN aggro in groups with 200+ AAXP rogues, rangers, and wizards... they own aggro like a champ...Okay... I've seen the opposite... wheres the response? <br />
<br />
I don't know.  Maybe the warrior vendor in PoK who gives out the Blade of War for 10 plat hasn't spawned?  Does he spawn next to the paladin vendor who has Cease &amp; Desist?<br />
<br />
When Warriors have aggro like knights, there truly is no reason to have knights along as our spells become parlor tricks...  <br />
<br />
I guess it wouldn't be imbalancing to give warriors the level 49 necro pet.  Besides, its just a parlor trick, right?<br />
<br />
Knight strengths have always been hard to understand.. hard to comprehend, and even harder to get groups to see. <br />
<br />
Hey we agree on something!<br />
<br />
I have a REAL problem of having to go back to the days of Kunark when knights had to fight to be considered worth the lag they caused by existing<br />
<br />
This seems to be the rallying cry for people like you.  The only way you will see things like Kunark again is if:  Cease, Desist, Brells, Valor of Marr, and all heals over time are deleted from paladin spellbooks.  The experience penalty is reinstated and knight defense &amp; defensive skill caps are reduced.  Revert the 2H damage bonus.  Take away all hybrids disciplines.  And remove KEI from the game.<br />
<br />
Warriors aren't asking for any of this.  Only for the ability to maintain a reasonable level of agro.  I personally feel it should be the exact amount that a paladin can sustain without draining his mana pool.  Kunark was horrid, and the reason I quit my paladin in the first place.  The current imbalance is obvious, and if you don't improve warrior agro ability, the only alternative is to nerf knights.  And being that I play a paladin now, that is the last thing I want to see.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Except for the SK spells that SPECIFICALLY give added hate to a player, isnt aggro supposed to be a DETRIMENTAL effect of the spell?<br />
<br />
I do not see anywhere in the cease/stun/etc spell description. This mob Stuns a mob and gives you its undivided attention. It is supposed to be a DETRIMENT!<br />
<br />
That is the problem, Why cannot people see this? Why cannot paladins ADMIT this? I think Clerics, one of the parent classes to paladins will admit this readilly, aggro from stuns is BAD...<br />
<br />
Because of all the upgrades over the expansion, Aggro from spells in 99% of the game is NO LONGER a detrimental effect for a paladin. It is now a strength. This is what is wrong, no longer is it a trade off to have a paladin tank, they could always grab aggro, it was just more effort to keep them alive than a warrior. This is really no longer the case.<br />
<br />
There is no trade off to use a secondary or alternate tank, over a class that HAS NO OTHER purpose than to tank. <br />
<br />
Either SOE needs to seriously upgrade the warrior class so that we are AT LEAST a viable alternative to knights, or they need to cut back on knights abilities, ie nerf them. <br />
<br />
I would prefer upgrading warriors, if you have read any of the post I have made, but what is the most likely course of action? I think we all know that answer...<br />
<br />
As to the comment about the 10khp war with 200AA  full elemental and a BoW owning aggro, and tanking and dps... <br />
<br />
WELL DUUUHHHHH!!! <br />
<br />
sorry, but they are supposed to, as to the other 10,000 warriors I guess they are SOL, and joe smo the store bought Paladin deserves to be better because of that one warrior...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Correct me if I'm wrong... the agro that Disease Cloud caused has been reduced since its original incarnation.  Which would imply that it was never intended to generate so much agro, and that the oversight has since then been adjusted.  I'm going to lose an argument concerning how well shadowknights generated agro back during the first 2 years of EQ.  Most of my experience with shadowknight agro was limited observation, nothing firsthand.  So if casting a single 10 mana Disease Cloud on a mob was all that was needed to hold agro for an entire fight, I'll have to take your word for it.<br />
<br />
Flash of Light on the otherhand is not a bread &amp; butter taunter.  It's a dangerous spell, especially in dungeons.  I know very few paladins who ever have it mem'd regularly, at any level.</div></div><hr />

If you remove agro from stuns, you break the paladin class.  A change like that would make paladins the worst taunter in the game.<br />

This is the biggest load of uninformed bullshit I've ever seen. I played an SK up to 64 before retiring him and I know you have absolutely NO FUCKING CLUE what you are talking about. I used a 45/40 two hander and did all of 49 dps with a 270 str (1139 self buffed atk). HOLY SHIT did I just say 49, let me spell it out for you FOURTY NINE DPS. With two dots, my spears, taps, and pet I was looking at 90ish dps. This is with KEI/Tranq/VoQ/Pact of Hate, 100%+ Haste (Forget what capped level is for a 64) AND hitting from behind. So tell me mister dumbass, where in the FUCK did you pull 120% from? I'd REALLY like to see those numbers personally.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh and FYI If an SK is going to dot and nuke/tap EVERY mob he goes OOM within twenty-thirty minutes with VoQ and 220+int (Approx 3500ish mana, not counting 100+ mana items). <br />
<br />
This is cute, cause with my SK's ONE HANDER, Black Rock Maul of Crushing, and a SHIELD, I was doing over EIGHTY DPS.  Not counting spells and pet</div></div><hr />

<br />
my point is, that myself and most of those that i play with agree, knights can get agro and hold it, this is not a suprise or a shock.  but generally, this is not a good thing(tm).  we see the roll of knights in raid/exp groups as extra dps, an extra heal here or there, and pulling stuff off of casters.<br />

my druid i played till 52, he is now semi retired, my wife played a paladin to 52 (stuck there till she gets her books, got vox need naggy)<br />

Aggro on spells was originally suppossed to be detrimental - at least for non-knight classes.  Without talking to the original developers it is only conjecture if it was intended as a benefit or detriment to knights.  It is only with the release of PoP that people now see the benefit to a Knight being able to aggro.  Pre-SoL I, when I could get a group, I always was able to get the mob off of the caster when it turned.  Of course, 75% of the time I received a tongue lashing &quot;let the tank do his job&quot;.  <br />
<br />
That was normally the cleric who would get upset - the enchanter would sometimes send a private thanks.</div></div><hr />

Although only useable by Tunare worshippers, the Nature's Defender is a pretty easily gotten weapon, with a better proc than their epic, better ratio and proc rate too.  Holds agro for the paladin easily.<br />
<br />
Disease Cloud WAS the best agro holder in the game, until they changed slows.  DC adds a disease counter.  It used to be those disease counters gave a LOT of agro, enough for shamans/enchanters to understand that if they slowed, they were dead.  Warriors simply couldn't generate THAT much agro to compensate, and Taunt didn't always work.  SKs could tho, but this was before the plethora of upgrades Knights got that made them the tanks they are today.  DC was &quot;nerfed&quot; when they changed how much agro disease counters gave...DC can still gain agro, but DC only gives like 1 counter compared to 16 on slows.  The nerf was more of a side effect of this change (Absor actually posted on our boards saying that we shouldn't be using a level 9 spell to gain agro at high levels anyways, as our higher level spells do the same thing still, just takes more mana...hmmm...this sound familiar to anyone?).<br />
<br />
I'm actually a strong proponent to change stuns where if the mob is immune to the stun portion (any damage still affects agro as normal), it gives less agro than it does now, or if it actually lands.  I understand this would change some of the weapon setups used by warriors...so other things would need to change as well.  Paladins would still have stuns available to them to let them gain agro (although some levels would mean they were weaker than they are on other levels...however this is true to several casters, not paladins alone)<br />
<br />
Paladins and shadowknights are NOT the same way they were back in Kunark or so.  They're only upgrade has not just been agro abilities.  Their defensive abilities have been upgraded, Taunt now maxes at 220 at 60, many spells have been given to them, solidifying their role and capabilities.  Not only that, but people KNOW more.  They know more about what a paladin and SK can do now (hell, PoP at least did that much, giving easy groups to these classes allowing people to see what they can do).  How many people know all of what a beastlord can do?  Not as many...how many people know that at 62, a BST can give everyone BMB plus atk?  It takes time for people to learn these things.  People know more about what a Knight can do now tho, so taking away agro, despite claims, would not make knights the same they were a couple years ago.<br />
<br />
Although, people aren't wanting knights to lose ALL agro...like myself, people just want the DIFFERENCE overall to lessen in some way.  Although many others just want to bring something else to the group besides just tanking, like knights.</div></div><hr />
