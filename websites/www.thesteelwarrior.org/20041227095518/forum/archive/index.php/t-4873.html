Saw Rhag1 was up, one of my apps needed the Orb of Luclanite, the the family-guild types around me could use the loot, so I took some people to go kill him. Something I've done many, many times.<br />
<br />
I was pulling, and snagged a few hits from Rhag1 as I got the two snakes behind him. His proc landed on me. few moments later, I engaged him, poped off evasive, and low and behold, it lasted all of about 2 ticks. Turns out his proc (Embrace of Rhag Zhezum, I think) seems to have a serious Endurance drain to it.<br />
<br />
I don't really mind the idea of a mob that limits the use of openings or Incite or any of the other new abilities... but this change means that certain mobs are no longer subject to melee disciplines!<br />
<br />
Seriously, if it's fair that Invigor no longers gives back Sta (Now Endurance) I can't see how it's fair that a proc that drained Sta should be able to drain endurance.</div></div><hr />

I will await patiently for the patch to fix this non-problem.<br />
<br />
If you bother to look at the Lucy data for the 18th ( when the endurance patch occured ) you will notice the AEs were specifically changed to affect endurance instead of stamina. But yes, im sure it is a bug. whoo whoo.<br />

How will anyone possibly defeat the Rhags without defensive.<br />

See his effect Manastorm (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/spell.html?spell=1043).<br />
<br />
Or there's Fennin Ro (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=10778) with his Cataclysm of Ro (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/spell.html?spell=3055)<br />

<br />
Eindride is a great example. One of those encounters where our pally sits far out of range and plays patcher and pet handler =)<br />
<br />
Was just a little over-jealous in my attempt to prove the point that endurance drain is perfectly acceptable if not over-used.<br />
<br />
In fact, I LIKE it.<br />
<br />
If I wanted to play a game I could never lose, I would go grab a single qaurter, head to the arcade and play Golden Axe til my wrists gave out.<br />

<br />
I fought the Nadox version of Innoruk and used Stonewall only to have it last 3 seconds. I thought I had accidently clicked it off but in the patch after the patch message they said it was a bug.<br />

Apparently there are more bugs they were not aware of.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jinaabi</div><div class="date">12-22-2003, 01:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cily, you forget, that casters have options to counteract the effects of a mana-drain AE such as mod rod, twitch, sit a med out of range, or simply hide from the AE. Warriors have no way to regen endurance beyond sitting.<br />
<br />
By putting in a endurance drain AE, warriors will not only lose def, but every other disc we have, and would then have to rely ONLY on the original taunt for any type of agro management and survivability...<br />
<br />
<br />
Personally, they need to fix it! Or, add endurance regen or restore spells/items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wulfran</div><div class="date">12-22-2003, 02:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Jinaabi pretty much echoes my sentiment. I wouldn't mind the endurance drain if there was some way to counter it. We don't get buffs, we don't get boosts off items (although I thought that was supposed to be something they were looking at).<br />
<br />
BTW Cursed is another one with an endurance drain AE.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So it was just a blanket change to keep the system from having a spell cast with a reference to a non existant data.</div></div><hr />

I really hope they don't, though, I don't have enough buff slots as is, but I fear there will be a VoQ version of end regen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CyrzB</div><div class="date">12-22-2003, 05:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not particularly worried about the Rhags per se, even without evasive 2 family-guild-level healers is more then enough (IE, no or maybe f1 or 2, no mp4).<br />
<br />
What does concern me is that I can no longer use my /disc's on mobs I previously could.<br />
<br />
I really can't, off the top of my head, list any mobs that this would actually matter to me- IE, mobs my guild kills for loot. Simply because if they did drain stamina, I would not have noticed it previously.<br />
<br />
However, I would like to get this word out. First of all, to the warrior community. There may be a guild out there who, two weeks ago could kill Rhag1, for example, and who now can't.<br />
<br />
Secondly, I would like to make sure the Dev's know this happens. There is 3 possibilities, either the change was unintended, and they don't know about it, and it will change. Or the change was unintended, they don't know about it, but upon finding out about it, will decide to leave it in, either in part or in full, and intelligently add it to future encounters, rather then if they didn't know and just added it randomly like they have been.<br />
<br />
Or they intended it.<br />
<br />
I beleive it was unintended. The mobs they put it on, like Rhag1, aren't the kind of mobs I would see them adding this too intentially. It would be like giving Severillous a Death Touch- Upgrading Old World mobs that higher levels only see for pure boredom or cash loots.</div></div><hr />

Why take the time to ask why take the time?  Fella said he thought it wasn't fair, next fella said he thought it was.  What's the big deal?  You're usually far above that sort of quibbling; it took me by surprise that it was you who posted that, actually. Having a bad day or sump'n?</div></div><hr />

There are a very small number of mobs that have STA (END) draining effects.  However, the fact that any do, especially to the point of draining the entire pool after a couple of ticks, is ridiculous in my opinion.  I used to play a caster and sure there are mobs with mana drain, but I can't say that I've ever had my entire mana pool drained in a couple of ticks.  It would've made me worthless as a caster.  Ok, so endurance draining isn't as detrimental to a melee as mana drain is to a caster, but I still think that this is a bug and should be changed.  I could see some type of endurance drain from mobs, but it definitely shouldn't be on the order of draining all our endurance in a few ticks.</div></div><hr />

Sorry to hear about your day.  Boxing Day should be a special day for Warriors - until there is a Stabbing Day.  I'ma feeling pretty much the way you say about the implementation of END drain (and have been fortunate so far not to suffer it yet, nor be silenced).  But I like the idea of it, design wise.<br />
<br />
Good to hear about the ass and stuff tho :D.</div></div><hr />

I saw no noticeable effect. Removed all food and water and burned my endurance to nothing. Had jig running for a good couple of minutes and was nothing. Not the most scientific t est, but i dont think it works.</div></div><hr />

Jig doesn't regen sta, it reduces sta lost (at least according to lucy).  Did a bit of testing and didn't see an obvious effect tho, so I'm guessing it's &quot;broken&quot; now.  Will do a bit more checking next time I have a bard handy tho.<br />
