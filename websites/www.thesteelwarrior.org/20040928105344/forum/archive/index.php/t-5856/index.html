<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>quirkyguy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm just curious what people's thoughts are on VDD if you have one...  I had wanted one for a long time, but using dkp my guild had it overpriced *or so i felt* and since the last one went to someone in negative dkp, I took our second one *in 30+ TT kills* that dropped today... I was somewhat dissapointed to say the least, I haven't thrown an aug in it yet *can't decide whether to go with 125dd+stun or anger3* and I have an EoE+SEM to tank with.  I pretty much took VDD to tank stuff that had high riposte rating and do dps when I'm not tanking *which is often*, but after taking VDD it seemed like I was doing no dps with bard+enc haste, and while in a PoE group I lost agro often, during an adventure I was over-agro'd often by undergeared random pick up people... I'm just curious does anyone with one think it's good for tanking? DPS? XP? Adventures etc?  Will an augment make that much difference?  Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mulberry</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think VDD is a fine DPS weapon if you are not Main tank.  I use mine for DPS when not MTing now that I have Darkblade/EoE combo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Frax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've had my Vanazir (AngerIII augmented) about a month now i guess, and I love it.  Obviously a DBoTW and EoE will be superior agro as has been parsed and posted here before, but you shouldn't have any problems tanking with a Vanazir at all.  I noticed you didn't have punishing blade finished, get that done, it is basically the 2h version of Ambidexterity and does make a difference.</div></div><hr />

However with Time BP and incite, she usually doesn't even bother to change weapons while tanking gods, and has no problems keeping or taking agro (on bosses).</div></div><hr />

It's a great DPS weapon if your other tanks have DBotW.  It's a good aggro weapon if your guild is new to Time and doesn't have a lot of DBotW yet.  DBotW and any other weapon are far superior aggro though.<br />
<br />
For augs, I'd recommend Ykesha for it, so you've got decent aggro and some DPS.  It'll eventually just be a DPS weapon in the end, so you won't want anger3 on it, but ykesha is still managable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Trondir, have you seen how many more items Terris has on her loot table, when compared to Rallos.  I know she can drop 3 items, but she does have the ability to drop a wider variety of items than him.<br />
<br />
For now, my guild is 1/2 on VDD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Kakgumu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Loot tables aside for just a second...are you saying that getting to Phase 4 of PoTime and getting the RZ in PoTactics are equally difficult??  These two items aren't even in the same order of magnitude in difficluty to get.<br />
<br />
And yes, the drop rate at least for our guild has been low.  I think we have 4 drops in about 20-25 kills now.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Niafix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">No, I wasn't saying that it is equally difficult to get to tier4 time, I was responding to Trondir's statement, in which he says that VDD is more, or equally common to RZ blade.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Aug'd Vdd &gt; Aug'd Sews imo.  The ac debuff + dd generates more aggro then Rune3 for sure.  Aug'd Bow &gt; Vdd,.  It still makes a decent tanking weapon though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Niafix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">We have about 25 VDDs and 1 BoW.<br />
<br />
I guess, I would say that if you killed RZ as much as you killed TT, you would have more BoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">we have like a 66% droprate on VDD's but its hard to say anything about droprates in time because they are so god damn random, some guilds get tons and others its rreally rare</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Related question:<br />
I have a DBotW(AngerIII)/EoE(AngerII), Raex BP, and Symbol of the Planesmasters.<br />
<br />
When not MTing (most of the time) I swap out DBotW for a SEM (some 150DD aug).<br />
<br />
Since we are getting to the point most regulars have a PoTime weapon, I've been thinking of getting a VDD /w Force of YKesha so that I can grab aggro if necessary and still do good DPS when not MTing. I'd do the rather clumsier 2H out/2-1 H in swapping as I anticipated the need.<br />
<br />
Alternately I could just get a Force of YKesha aug for the EoE and continue using the SEM when not MTing (simple minded swapping). Waddaya think?<br />

<br />
There is a decent 19/21 +1 cudgel in tier 2, or a very nice 1h from GoD raid trials.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Mourningloree</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Originally posted by Niafix <br />
I guess, I would say that if you killed RZ as much as you killed TT, you would have more BoW.  <br />
<br />
Given pseudoinstancing it's pretty much guaranteed to see TT every 6 days.  You try to find RZ up every 6 days for periods at a time today :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">we killed RZ 20 times and we recieved 8 BoW I think..<br />
so far we recieved 5 vanazirs from 13-14 TT kills. IMO that is close enough in droprate that you cant really say the VDD is more rare compared to the BoW.<br />
<br />
This is ignoring the difficulty comparsion of obtaining both items, but common sense kinda tells me that a guild doing Rallos for loot &amp; flags is most likely to be far away from PoTime and a guild that broke into phase4 of time is unlikely to go back to RZ more often than every 2nd month.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>thundersam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I have both augmented with anger 3, and i agree with Bakaris here. Before combat effects and WA id say they were pretty equal in aggro, tho i liked vdd more because you didnt have to rely on procs so much as with BoW, atm tho with ce and wa5 i think BoW is better aggro, but both work out well (more hp svs and dps with vdd). <br />
<br />
On rarity my guild had pretty much luck with BoW 7 BoWs in 19 clearings and 9 vdd on 15 TT kills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Grimhead</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">This is my situation. I am currently using Emp sword auged with anger 3 and I have Aten gloves. Currently we can kill everything in Time besides Quarm and Inny. I need a new weapon so bad so I was gonna loot either VDD or DBotW. O yeah my guildleader has me tank #2 alot. You guys think I should loot a VDD if it drops first? I guess im kinda sceptical. I mean im sure the VDD is gonna blow the emp sword out of the water as far as agro goes but then again DBotW/EoE is gonna own VDD. HEPL!!!!!!!!</div></div><hr />

You have no problem because they adjust their dps to you tanking. ie they hold back.</div></div><hr />

Is this really a warrior equipped in Velious gear commenting on clearing Time, or do you need to update your profile?<br />
<br />
I have the Ruj DD on my Vanazir and I use it as a DPS weapon 90% of the time. I normally use my dual wield set up for aggro, but I use Vanazir on occasion without any trouble holding aggro. I have found the Vanazir to be an excellent aggro/tanking weapon myself.</div></div><hr />

My VDD isnt aug'd yet, I need to do some more South Ro adventures. Though, with the SK buff, I tanked PoEb minis without loosing aggro a single time, which is imo great because i dont have any offensive AAs but Weapon affinity1.<br />
I will aug it with anger3 for sure. I'll let ya know what I think after but I am pretty sure it will be great aggro.</div></div><hr />

I think your missing the point. It gets old coming to this forum and reading posts from people that shouldn't be posting here to begin with. Wading through all the useless posts gets old fast. I'm sure you would feel the same if a warrior came over posted on playing a wizard on the Graffe forum.<br />
<br />
This forum is for HIGH LEVEL warrior posting. It is heavily moderated to ensure it remains that way. PoP elemental, Plane of Time, and Time-Level Ldon discussion only please. <br />
No offence, but you don't meet this criteria. We have actual warriors telling the original poster that the Vanazir should work out good. <br />
<br />
The original poster said: I'm just curious what people's thoughts are on VDD if you have one... <br />
No offence again, but you don't meet this criteria either. He wants opinions on people that have a VDD, seems painfully obvious to me.<br />

My guild cleared Time with a warrior using a Vanazir as his primary weapon every week for 7 straight months. The first 4 months was prior to having access to LDoN augments. We cleared Time in one night without any trouble, our wizards managed just fine. <br />

After farming the crap out of Time for 7 months I looted a rpp free ED that was going to rot. It was better than my previous offhand, and while it wasn't my first choice for an offhand weapon, I have no regrets. Better I loot a small upgrade rather than seeing it rot, wouldn’t you say?</div></div><hr />

I was once playing a high level warrior during Velious, I tanked the stuff in WToV when Aaryonar was only killed by FoH etc. So I have at least some experience that a good number of warriors posting here do not have. I also match the high level criteria, if you were on right now I'd drown you in Ikkinz loot links np ;)<br />
Theres not much as valuable as a neutral outside opinion, or you will simply have a blind sided discussion and might miss important stuff because you were unable to see the issue from a different point of view. VDD definatly works out good, but it shouldnt be considered a long term agro solution.<br />

Again, the fact that they didnt have trouble staying alive means they adjusted to the agro loss over a BoW pretty well.<br />

<br />
Yes, I do now believe DB and EoE to be higher agro than Vana, but it isn't by much.  Our MT still uses Vana often over his DB/EoE some times and we do exceedingly well.  So to say that VDD isn't a long term agro solution when the MT of one of the leading guilds across all servers uses it for his main weapon setup seems a bit premature.<br />
<br />
While I don't have a warrior per say, I did play a warrior using VDD without a time bp in several Ikkinz trials without a single death from any party member.</div></div><hr />

My reading comprehension is telling me that, based on your warrior profile, you haven't tanked anything past the Kael Arena or the Halls of Testing and even those items can be MQed. I'm seeing a level 65 warrior that's still wearing a Crafted Breastplate commenting on the high end warrior game. I've seen your useless posts on numerous threads in this forum and can only conclude that you're some type of board troll.<br />
<br />
Ok, I guess you'll move your ass over to the knights and GoD thread and tell Wandor to get lost as well.<br />
It would seem to me that based solely on the title of that thread that it should be in The War Room, &quot;A temporary forum intended for the discussion of Class Balance.&quot; I couldn't care less what's going on with hybrids in GoD so you probably wouldn’t find me posting on it.<br />
<br />
You may or may not be a l33t GoD wizard, and I really don't care. But why not go help your wizzie brother and sisters over at Graffe. I'm sure they would greatly benefit from your knowledge of the class, we can survive over here without your obviously inferior incite into the warrior class. Perhaps we should reserve this forum to high end warrior discussion by high end warriors, as it was intended. Then again we can just allow it to be degraded by trolls like you. <br />
<br />
The Vanazir is fine weapon weather you're using for aggro as a MT or simply using it as dps.<br />

Peace-</div></div><hr />

if you had a fucking clue, you'd know Trondir couldnt possibly have tanked anything during velious. If you cared to see the 1. retired 2. last update date stamp on the magelo. you'd maybe realized whats this all about. For the last time, for the mentally slow people like yourself (everyone else knows this by now) my main's a GoD raiding wizard, doing Ikkinz4 right now.<br />
<br />
Absolutly amusing however that you try to mock on my ability only being able to tank Kael Arena, when you actually wear a BP coming from there =P<br />
Seeing how iskander told us both to stuff it, yet you go on with it, makes YOU the troll. you win :-)<br />

unless you are using 2 different computes and have a hand permanently on the other keyboard, you can't possibly nuke this fast, or you dont bother moving Brodda around alot anymore.</div></div><hr />

I wasn't going to get involved but I might as well straighten this out. <br />
<br />
Absolutly amusing however that you try to mock on my ability only being able to tank Kael Arena, when you actually wear a BP coming from there =P <br />
<br />
The BPs from Kael were pretty outrageous for their time, when you look at the BPs from SoL you don't get a lot of upgrades either.  BP of the Void generally went to clerics because of the mana on it and it is generally a lateral upgrade. BP of Speed was good but pretty rare considering most guilds only killed one of the 2 2nd flooor warder keepers and the AHR bp is also fairly rare.  Seru is an easy farm now and I soppose could be considered a source of BPs but I know on ourserver he gets killed/farmed by 2 multi boxing people so that one is out too. Moving on to PoP you're really only looking at 3 bps, Ornate which is really a lateral upgrade from Eradication, the BP from the rathe which is another extremely rare one and finally Raex.  <br />
<br />
To mock him for using a BP from Velious thats still quite good today is pretty silly in my own personal opinion.  Especially one the other upgrades are marginal or extremely rare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">Crafted BPs was pretty outrageous for their time as well.<br />
He should have a Raex BP imo, and I only mock BACK, you know?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u73"><b>Valnir Lanys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p73">He should have a Raex BP imo. <br />
<br />
I'm sure thats the only thin in this entire thread that he agrees with you on, but that dosn't mean that they got enough BPs from RZ or that he had enough rpp when the dropped to get one.</div></div><hr />

work some PMs if you wanna continue this.</div></div><hr />

can you send PMs to multiple ppl? conference flaming imo!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u76"><b>Gakmag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p76">Back to the subject... I got my anger3 proc yesterday. I stayed up late to test it, but could only do easy LDON. I went from loosing aggro on every mobs (Rogue monk and wizard all overaggro'd me) to perfect aggro 99% of the time. The mob wouldnt turn at all except when i wouldnt proc for the the whole fight, which is kinda rare (and i only have Weapon affinity #1)<br />
<br />
Definatly(sp?) I think this weapon isnt for you if you have a BoW or SEWS, but if you dont have good aggro and still waiting for a dbow, I think its a good move until you can get a dbow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>Aielman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">I used, and continue to use, the VDD with anger 3 and no combat effects for at least 25 runs through Time, 20+ before there was any WA, and have zero problem with it for agro, even on Saryrn. Tanked everything but VZ ant CT with it, up to and including Quarm, and hold agro just fine unless some bucket head wizard overdoes it.<br />
<br />
I've taken agro from an anger 3 auged BoW from a warrior was that was trying and held it as well...so I don't see a BoW being all that superior.<br />

For what it's worth...<br />
