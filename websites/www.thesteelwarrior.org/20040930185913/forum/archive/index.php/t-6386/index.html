Curious as to where this drops.  No Raex yet, and they are so rare I may not get one.  This is pretty comparable if not better in all ways but the Echo of Anger omission.<br />
<br />
link fixed =D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Paen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Vadd is the name of the NPC in Abysmal Sea that gives the armor quest for warriors, as far as I know no one has actually got or seen any Vadd's armor it was just sniffed out of the item database using his name and linked around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">if this item hasnt been found yet, how do we know the identify text?</div></div><hr />

if this item hasnt been found yet, how do we know the identify text?  <br />
<br />
Probably because as has already been posted, links to the item were found (and not through legit means), and the item was added to lucy.  It's pretty much the same thing that happened with the Raex bp, only in that case, the one first discovered, is not the one that actually exists in game (check on lucy to see both versions).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">that doesnt answer the question. to get identify text, you have  to possess the item. you cant cast identify on an item link</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Brodda Thep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The lore belongs to the item.  Take a look at lucy for any item and look at raw data.  Everything there belongs to an item and can be retrieved from a simple link.  So you get lore, procrate mods, etc etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>kurghann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">you guys didn t get luck with plate BP s ? they seemed to be dropping quite a lot on Karana for Novae fama and us now . At least way more than DBOW ( cries ) <br />
 Rumored arms with echo of anger from god as well ... but when i can i d sure snag a raex myself .. it s not a rumor it s a genuine good BP . The GoD plate legs are quite the same as the CT legs from time so i don t think the PLate bp would blow the raex away . altho this is only supposition ...<br />
hugs hula  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Brudal the Fat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The legs you refer to are from the Ikkinz trials though the Joint Scale greaves or something?<br />
<br />
I am sure when Vadd's armor is found the legs will be better than CT since the quest armor will most likely come from Tier4 GoD.</div></div><hr />
