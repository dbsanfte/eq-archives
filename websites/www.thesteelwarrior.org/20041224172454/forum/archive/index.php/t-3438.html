<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sorguran</div><div class="date">10-05-2003, 08:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">When in LdoN,  I find myself more and more grped with this setup: Wiz(or mag), sham(or BL), ench, cleric, paladin, and myself.<br />
<br />
That setup is great for a few reasons, first is that the second tank takes alot off the ench.  It allows for chain pulling of 3+ mobs,  get 3, kill 2 and one down to 50% with pally tanking have pally stun, and have wiz nuke while the next 3 mobs come in.<br />
<br />
The second reason this is a really viable option is because of the paladin's healing power, for incase the cleric dies, sometimes especially in the case when you have a bst healing instead of sham.   Along this tread also the rez provided by paladin is more than worth it imo,  2 rezzing classes &gt; 1.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying this is balance at all, because that group right there doesn't allow for what?  Can anyone tell me?  Melee who do DPS.   You'd think that wiz would be interchangeable with a rog, or maybe even a monk,  but DPS |= the same DPS or even close to that of a wizard or mag.   The more you do it the more you see your dps is only noticeable improved when you have a wiz or mag.  <br />
<br />
So my take on the whole problem is, war aggro needs a fixing, be it by nerfing paladin aggro, or adding something to wars.   This REALLY won't hurt your grpage anyways paladins/SK.... because no matter what you're more usefull than us untill VI fixes itemization,  who has BSS?  Who has added ability of FD?  Who has... UBER DISARM!?(hint this last one is warrior)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Splaktar</div><div class="date">10-05-2003, 01:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh I've been grouped in LDON with the following: wiz, wiz, war, rogue, ench, paladin...  Paladin had plenty of mana to heal the whole group as we more or less went non-stop thru the whole dungeon.  Only one who ran low on mana was Ench, but that was because our idiot rogue tripped 2 traps that dispelled VoQ each time.<br />
<br />
Pretty funny when a Paladin can not only heal themselves, but now have so much mana that they can heal whole groups.<br />
<br />
And yes even during other times I'm grouped with Paladins a ton, who always tank because I can almost never get aggro off them.  Lately it seems like we've been having a lot more Paladins log in (had like 8 the other day), and fewer warriors (as few as 1 out of 12)... big surprise...<br />
<br />
Oh and for add tanking in LDoN, we use rogues, rangers, pal, sk, monks, shaman, etc... anyone can do it just about.  But yeah you need at least 1 add tank who isn't a pure caster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aldarion_Shard</div><div class="date">10-05-2003, 01:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah, I actually do have paladin friends and I like paladins a LOT for LDoN groups.  Hell, Ive always grouped with paaldins.<br />
<br />
Which is why Ive always called paladins out on the bullshit lie that &quot;Tanking is all paladins can do&quot;.  If paladin tankability got nerfed down to Druid level tomorrow, Id still want paldins for my groups.<br />
<br />
There is no better off tanker, currently, and even if that tankability was rmeoved their would be no substitute for BSS, Group Heals, LoH, and backup (or the only) rez.  Not to mention Pacify in some zones, but I refuse to let people use that shit in LDoN so its not normally an issue.<br />
<br />
Paladins are great groupmates as long as they dont try to be main tank.  Which of course makes it all the more infuriating when they claim &quot;oh noz were only tanks!! our spells are useless!!&quot;</div></div><hr />

A Beastlord with competent defensive AAs can tank just fine on normal adventures....<br />
<br />
ND 3, CS 3, and perhaps a few in CA would make a beastlord a fine tank....<br />

At level 40 I tanked the boss mob in an assinastion(sp) mission in LDON.  I know that doesnt compare to level 60+ mobs but still it shows beastlords can tank to a point.

This is true. Kitchi sometimes tanks in BoT and doesn't have TOO many problems, but he still has to convince the Holy Trinity believers that it's fine for now ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Boleslav</div><div class="date">10-06-2003, 11:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As player gear/abilities catch up to content more and more classes can tank effectively.  It didn't take too long after PoP came out that well geared knights could hold their own tanking in most PoP situations.  Now, as things drag further along, well geared and played characters of the other hybrid classes are tanking well in much of PoP/LDoN.  <br />
<br />
Mudflation always favors generalists over specialists.  Warriors are taking the brunt of this.  There are few situations that require a Warrior.  If the situation does not require even a plate tank, and the group is geared well enough to deal with the healing, Beastlords and Rangers can tank just fine.  <br />
<br />
This to me points out the fallacy behind nerfing knights.  You will just move the target one step down the ladder.  Warriors need to be improved more than knights need to be nerfed.  Also, the situations that are risky enough to favor a Warrior should be more rewarding.  Right now there is very little single group content that actually favors a Warrior once you average about 100 AA in the group.<br />
<br />
AA is a huge problem for encounter and class balancing.  The difference in power between a 65 character with 0 AA and a 65 Character with 150 AA is profound.  Yet both characters get the same amount of experience from a given mob.  There is precious little benefit to face tougher content when you can race through mobs designed around a level 65 with 0 AA at a rapid clip.  LDoN emphasizes this currently.  Normal missions are actually challenging for a group with average level of 64 and 6 AA.  A group of 65s with 250 AA gets the EXACT SAME encounter though.  Of course they can tear through it like nobody's business.<br />
<br />
Nerfing knights doesn't help this situation one whit.  Increase Warriors to be competitive for groups in that situation (read:  aggro increase at least), and add content that favors a warrior with a level of reward that makes people choose to do it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomb</div><div class="date">10-06-2003, 08:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Boleslav, I wholeheartedly agree that AA make a ton of difference, but just in case I have to say that the group i told about in my former post wasnt out of 65's with 250 AA.<br />
Cleric 120 AA (which is good but clerics have a ton of good AA to get), Shaman 180 AA, Beastlord 90 AA, Warrior 230 or so AA then(me), Warrior 190 AA (with similar hp to mine but using duel wield setup-he is still waiting for a BoW) and the other warrior at 120 AA(more defensive than offensive with 2hander from dresolik 35 delay/45 damage - nice for dps, but crap agro with blood boil proc).<br />
<br />
I had groups with and average AA (when taking mine out of the calculation) of about 25 to 30 working very well.<br />
Of course they wont finish a slaughter and have to wait 20 minutes to get a new adventure but LDoN works very well for people who know how to play a class regardless of gear and AA.<br />
<br />
I dont go into LDoN to set new records, its to get to know new people and have some fun.<br />
Of course i dont say no if i get to tank for a group from the servers top guild (rare but happened) and its fun going through guk with barely a challenge, the puller deliberatly pulling whole rooms of 5 or simply rushing from one to next.<br />
<br />
My own experience with top end knights is that they let me tank and grab agro if necessary, while a lot of younger (regarding playtime) knights seem to have agro envy and try to grab agro all the time.<br />
A lot of casters used to never getting hit doesnt really help there.<br />
<br />
Agro increase will help but it will not change attitude of people.</div></div><hr />
