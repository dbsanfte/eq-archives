<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Potam</div><div class="date">10-26-2003, 09:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi. My friend has decided to quit and he left me his account. His character is a 65 warrior on another server, so I am going to be xfering him over to my server with my 60 druid. I'm planning on buying him some cheap armor (crusty or something) just to get it going and some decend weapons (12/18 and stats). I don't have alot of cash stored up since I didn't plan on recieving this character, but now I need to equip him.<br />
Does anyone have any ideas for some items a 65 warrior and 60 druid can camp that will yield good drops (either to sell or for warrior to use)? I was thinking about farming seb for a week or 2, but was wondering about some more places.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help!</div></div><hr />

Stuff from there is still worth cash on the market :) You could grab Moktor stuff from UP, ME Rot loot etc etc to start him out on gear. Decent Weps (Frostbringer goin 2.5k-3k on Tarew, along with a Yak proccing wep, or hell even a dps wep, you would do fine for duoing with a druid) , Decent BP, SS Gaunts MQ, you can work from there.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Potam</div><div class="date">10-27-2003, 07:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd do it, but all of my friends are on my server. Plus, I've looked at the warrior's gear, and it isn't that impressive... it'll prolly take me a few months to replace the warrior's gear.<br />

Thanks for the replies!</div></div><hr />

It is 31 dam/ 30 delay and pumps out nice damage and aggro and is dirt cheap.  It would probably outdamage the 12/18's I am guessing and you won't self destruct on mobs with damage shields.<br />
<br />
You may seriously consider making Veskar your new home.   Many many nice drops from there for someone in your situation and you will have tracker for named.  Can even snag a haste belt (soulscream).</div></div><hr />
