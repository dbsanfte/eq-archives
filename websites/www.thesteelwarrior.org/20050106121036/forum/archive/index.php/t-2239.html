2500pp to spend on upgrades, should I maybe buy some acrylia plate greaves and breastplate to get me by or should I save my money for something else first.  I havent yet started this character.  So I am sure I will be fine for the short term although I have a RL friend who will be PL'ing me up to around 50.<br />

What to do next?<br />

Then it all depends on how much cash you got to use.  50k, 100k, 200k, 500k, etc.  If you're filthy rich, trade in ure cultural armor as soon as the ac is near ure current ac items (crustacean?).<br />
<br />
Also keep all ure weapon skills maxed.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">07-29-2003, 05:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">should buy the armor first, tribunal isnt near as common as RZ. however with ornate dropping in the bazaar, really doesnt matter what you choose.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">weoden</div><div class="date">07-29-2003, 07:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">since your being pl'ed, I would consider an RGB.  That haste item will stay for a while and probably runs around 2500p.  Then replace the crafted bp with something... not sure what for 2500 range.  An elysian death mask probably runs in the 2500p as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
and you really need to figger out a race/religon first. it will decide as well what kind of armours are available to you...if you like RP'ing and some solid stats, pick a dwarf/brell char or a barbarian RZ/trib follower...if you want to be cookiecutter warrior go ogre/rz, if you like a smaller race with solid stats go halfling/rz, if you like a real challenge try iksar/ct, if you want to be the best of the best go halfelf :D but i'm biased.</div></div><hr />

<br />
and I only have 2500pp...  my friend would let me borrow some if I needed it but probably not anymore than about 5kpp<br />
