<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>arbosch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The mainproblem knights have at the moment is the same problem knights got prekunark with our healing side. Then we got penaltys for everything. This created double penaltys for everything. <br />
<br />
Cleric 1000manapool, healspell cost 100mana, heal100hps. This lead to = (1000/100)x100=1000hps healed.<br />
<br />
Now the smart designer made the decision knights need to be 50% as effectiv (not exactly this but it show the problem and is easier to calculate).<br />
<br />
So they made this.<br />
<br />
100mana 50% more mana needed = 150manacost<br />
1000manapool only 50% for knights = 500manapool<br />
100hps healed 50% as effectiv=50hps healed<br />
<br />
So they had the feeling we are now 50% as effectiv as clerics. But realistic it lead to this.<br />
<br />
(500/150)x50=166,67 hps healed. Like you see this 50% penalty everywhere dont lead to the 50% as effecitv as clerics. It lead to a way weaker casting side.<br />
<br />
Now today they make the same on our tanking side. They create penaltys for the knights for everything and even when they are only 5% there and there. They create a large gap without taking the disciplines.<br />
<br />
5% more hps, 5% less general migration create a double penalty which make us worser then 5%. First you have 5% more hps so it take 5% more seconds to get your hps down when we both migtrate the same. Now with 5% less migration you create the double penalty because now you allso get 5% less damage.<br />
<br />
10000hps warrior / 950hit every sec. = 10.52 Secs. that he die.<br />
9500hps knight / 1000hit every sec. = 9,5 Sec. that he die.<br />
<br />
Warriors like to say we are only 5% better because we get 5% more hps, better migration etc. Sorry to destroy your illusion. This dont create a 5% difference. This create a larger difference. Take in that you get hit for max less and we get hit for max more (parse show this) we create another penalty etc. which make us worser.<br />
<br />
Knights are that focused on disciplines because they simple break us. It is no problem today to be a 80 to 90% effectiv tank but to be a 40 to 50% effectiv tank is a to large gap and defensiv create that a high gap. The funny thing is that defensivlike disciplines create a double penalty themself. First it create a penalty because you get hit less against the knights (effect of the discipline). This is no question a penalty. Now the double penalty get created because the thing which should balance the defensiv like discipline (reuse timer) can get run up when you fight mobs which dont need this disciplines. So the penalty is that when they dont have the discipline they should be less effectiv (in case of light tanks) or only little better (in case of warriors) but because you fight mobs which dont need this disciplines they are not limited in there power.<br />
<br />
We know to which unbalance double penaltys lead for us knights in Kunark and they create the same now. But this time not on our 'utility'. This time they create it on our mainjob the tanking side which is even worser then the situation in kunark.<br />
<br />
Anyway knights are death with the designteam they have but i hate it to see warrior post stuff like we are only 5% better. You are way better then 5% because the double penalty which get created. Out of defensiv you will mostly be between 15 to 5% better then a knight and it need a lot of gear to neutralize this. Get in defensiv and you are godlike against knights with the same gear. Because you can us  this for mobs which need defensivtanking and can let the timer run up on mobs which dont need defensivtanking it is a low cost discipline with a great effect. <br />

<br />
Arborsch your main complaint seems to be that the design team has given Warriors the opportunity to actually receive some benefit from the defensive discipline outside of a raid environment and this will be &quot;death&quot; for Knights.  I can see what you're saying to a certain degree.  Which, if I'm not mistaken, is exactly why SoE has agreed that the GoD content will be examined and adjusted so that defensive isn't required to be called upon in single group content as frequently.  Once that is done, your arguement about Knights being headed for &quot;death&quot; is completely without basis.<br />
<br />
And all that hooey about double penalties, just seems to be something you've pulled out of thin air.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Double Penalty = BS<br />
Knights Needing Defensive to be usefull = BS<br />
<br />
GoD content is really really hard for 1 group setting.<br />
On that i do agree and to my eyes it is almost impossible for a Pal/SK to tank what i tank.<br />
<br />
Since &quot;gimping down&quot; content is not a solution, and will still keep a huge gap<br />
between &quot;those that can def&quot; &amp; &quot;those that cant def&quot; i find minidef a reasonable solution.<br />
Since it will not only assure War/Pal/SK suppremacy in tanking (even more than ever)<br />
But also enable SoE to make a lot more &quot;disc needed&quot; content.<br />
Since now &quot;disc&quot; wont be a 1 class only attribue. <br />
<br />
<br />
PS : And please get a FUCKING CLUE<br />
1) we dont mitigate 5% Better that is complete utter bullshit<br />
2) we dont have 5% more hp under most conditions (hello AoC).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Actually, Arbosch, the commonly accepted number that warriors are better than paladins in tanking on a day to day basis is not 5%, it is actually 12.5%.<br />
<br />
You do your job well enouh that there are no real complaints about tanking balance except for in GoD, which, what do ya know, is being looked at.<br />
<br />
The difference in tanking ability is made up for by the ability to stun mobs to mitigate damage (of which the level that stuns affect should be increased) and the ability to heal yourself, your group, buff yourself and your group, as well as root, rez, and the like.<br />
<br />
You don't mention at all the difference that these spells make, if fact you're focused on how much you percieve these spells to &quot;suck&quot;, which really shows that you're not looking at it dispassionately, you're focused on seeing only the negatives.<br />
<br />
Paladins don't need major changes, only minor ones with some content tuning. It's not as bad as you would have people believe.<br />
<br />
In all honesty, if you just want to whine (and that's all this looks like is complaining with no constructive class balance ideas or the like), go to PoN, you'll be in good company there.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Arbosch,<br />
<br />
I'm so glad you decided to post this hooie here and not just on EQLive and PoN.<br />
<br />
Paladins are Tank/priests. For several expansions they benefitted from doubled improvement and a synergy between priest spell casting and tanking. In LoY a very well equipped Warrior (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=853928) was not nearly as powerful as a very well equipped Paladin (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=853934). Paladins not only benefitted from melee improvements, but caster improvements like KEI, FT, focus items, and caster AA abilities.<br />
<br />
Not only were Paladins outperforming Warriors in experiance groups, but as the Arch Overseers pointed out that given the mob difficulty in PoP, the tanking gap between Warriors and Not Warriors was very small indeed.<br />
<br />
Between reaching the PoP endgame and GoD, Warriors got very very little - the Phase 1 Melee Update. &quot;-1 DI&quot; and even 500HP's for 60 AA does not equate to an insurmountable tanking lead that leaves Paladins out in the cold.<br />
<br />
In trials and in raids I don't hit Defensive for every mob I tank. Paladins don't need Defensive to tank yardtrash. Even in Ikkinz raids I don't always use Defensive for all of the red mobs before the final fights - it's not absolutely needed.<br />
<br />
Defensive is needed for some of the raid boss mobs and their red splits/death adds. Furious and AE taunt are darned useful in some fights. This is not PoP and Paladins don't get to be fully capable Warriors and have Spellbooks.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately in some trials, Defensive increases a Warrior's reliability while Knights are unreliable. This isn't fair and SoE is correcting it.<br />
<br />
I realize it's difficult to move from a couple of years of doubled (at least) advantages to an expansion where your spellbook doesn't give you tanking superiority. But SoE is making some adjustments. These won't result in you regaining full Warrior with a powerful Spellbook capability, but to be honest - that was not something that would be sustainable once SoE realized that is what had happened. Modest Warrior adjustments and an expansion that played to Warrior strengths were preferable to nerfing Paladins - SoE was on the right track. Unfortunately, they went overboard with how hard a couple of yellow mobs and trial boss mobs hit and as a consequence these will be adjusted.<br />
<br />
No Arbosch, Knights are NOT entitled to Defensive. This is the first expansion in years not designed so you can have &quot;Tank Parity&quot; (and Spellbook superiority) in virtually all of the content. I'd call that a refreshing change and a very successful new direction.<br />
<br />
GoD is innovative in many encounters where it breaks out of the 1 MT CH rotation design rut. Unfortunately in some cases mobs do hit too hard for players to appreciate the good design that is in GoD. I'm quite happy SoE is altering some content so Knights can enjoy GoD. I would be less than honest if I didn't add that I'm overjoyed they didn't share Defensive with Knights to the detriment of Warriors. It wasn't and it isn't necessary.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Heck, one PoN moderator is so unconcious that despite SoE having said Defensive is a defining Warrior ability that will not be shared, he's proposing <br />
Defensive in sheep's clothing (http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=paladinbalance&amp;message.id=20) on EQLive.<br />
<br />
I can't wait for the Warrior 90% Res and Warrior LoN Disciplines. Since they would be disciplines and not spells they wouldn't infringe on class abilities Warriors shouldn't share ;P<br />

I'm not starting a debate here or anything, but weren't YOU the one that suggested a vie like ability not hmmm more than 2 weeks ago? Your hypocrisy is as unmatched as a warriors defensive ability, and quite unique to boot.<br />
<br />
Edit: And how about you stop editing your msgs every 2 mins</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Taragor,<br />
I at one time (two months ago?) proposed a spell simular to this except for a few details (working from memory) - it had a minimum 5k mana cost and dropped the mana bar down to just enough mana to cast Cease and Desist to hold aggro.<br />
<br />
Afterward I realized just how bad an idea this was and proposed a Vie-like spell that overwrites Vie that requires casting as frequently as stuns used for &quot;stun mitigation&quot;, produces the same aggro as a resisted stun, could be interrupted, and could fizzle. This is probably a bad ideas also - it's waaaay too powerful.<br />
<br />
Fortunately, since then SoE has made it known that content will be adjusted and Defensive will not be shared. Some players are just so desparate to have Defensive, they pretend SoE hasn't said anything about the issue.<br />
<br />
There's no hypocrisy, I just came to my senses. Defensive is a Warrior defining ability that should not be shared - not as a spell, not while weilding a shield, and not by eating special food.<br />

Sorry if you don't like me editing my posts. Maybe you could ask the moderators to ban me since a Paladin objects.<br />

<br />
Your original post was around 2 month ago yes, but no further than 2 weeks ago you were STILL suggesting a vie like ability. Only since official last release from Brenlo have you never remnetionned it till today when you're making asinine statements about a PoN admin posting on eqlive. <br />
<br />

Let me get this straight. Someone posts a suggestion based on a theory you favored but with different effects/penalties and instead of debating the pros/cons of it you turn around and make it sound like the foundation of it was never in your thinking. <br />

Again, YOU suggested a different version, so saying you came to your senses AFTER the final release is where your *hypocrisy* comes in. Anytime you've made a suggestion that was remotely accepted you've backpeddled and denied the implications. Time and again. <br />
<br />

Sorry if you don't like me editing my posts. Maybe you could have the moderators ban me since a Paladin objects.<br />

I have no issues with editing, but you might wanna have the balls for once and leave EVERYTHING you say within your posts for longer than 1 min.<br />

Edit: Oh and the other part about editing your posts comes from it changing the text within the replys people make. Good way for you to take your foot out of your ass.</div></div><hr />

A one click no fail Defensive ability lasting 3 minutes is a far cry from a Vie-like buff intended to replace and mimic lost &quot;stun mitigation&quot;.<br />
<br />
The initial idea predates SoE's ruling that Defensive will not be shared. Not only was it a bad idea when I suggested more appropriate penalties (the general idea did not originate with me), but in addition it's an inappropriate suggestion NOW - which is what I pointed out when refering to it.<br />
<br />
BTW, I write/edit posts to reflect what I want to say and how I want to say it - my priviledge. I try very very hard not to edit after someone responds. <br />

<br />
As I said, I'm not trying to start a debate here on the merits or overpowerdness of the suggestion. I was just showing how you flip flop like a bass out of water.<br />
<br />
<br />

Not only was it a bad idea when I suggested more appropriate penalties (the general idea did not originate with me), but in addition it's an inappropriate suggestion now - which is what I pointed out when refering to it.<br />
<br />
Of course it predates the statement. That's not the point now is it. The point is that prior to SoE saying anything you believed that such an ability was not game breaking / might actually help. The fact that SoE made a statement afterwards doesn't mean they're 100% right and players are 100% wrong. I mean you still have some warriors that believe a change is needed which in the end makes you wonder if SoE is just too egotistical/paranoid to say *hmmm, you know what, we did goof a bit here and we'll make amends*. (This isn't directed specifically at defensive btw)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Quato</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I have played side by side my best friend Kinens (65 paladin) since we started playing in June '99.  I have seen the strength and weakness of both classes up close and personal for 5 years now.  I DO see defensive as a warrior defining ability as does my friend.  To suggest that Paladins &quot;need&quot; defensive to have a proper role is insane.   I view your hybred flexibility as your class defining ability set.  Paladins bring so much to the table that you all want to ignore for the sake of the defensive arguement.  Who pulls and positions boss mobs in many encounters, who has the tank saving LoH, who can follow Divine Arb with a nice wave heal, who can gain snap aggro at a moments notice, who can hold stun aggro without melee till mobs are mezzed, who can hold aggro while offtanking, and when all goes in the crapper who can pull through with a resurection... well I will give you a hint... it's not the Warrior.  For you guys to overlook all this utility and come here to bring up defensive is quite frankly a slap in the face.  <br />
<br />
I have done the Vxed and Tipt trials a combined total of 15 times to help other people get flags.  When my friend was having trouble getting through with his Paladin I said no problem, since I knew exactly what had to happen, I played his Pally and got him through both trials.  Was it tougher playing the Paladin in those???   Yes most certainly, none the less we did fine and I got him both flags by utilizing his unique abilities.<br />
<br />
Where were the Paladins when we were struggling through our late 50s and early 60s spending literaly hours LFG in hopes of gaining a few HP with each new level.  Doing this so when it was raid time we could step in and use our one big defining skill DEFENSIVE for the good of the guild as a whole.  Well I will tell you, Paladins were tanking for groups who would rather benefit from the utility of a Paladin over a pure Tank or off buying new spells as they gained the appropriate levels.  For once in a long long time - maybe ever - we are in a position where the choice not to have a spell book and be a pure tank makes a difference.  I for one am glad that there is some content that plays to our class advantages for once.  That being said I am also glad that the single group trials are being adjusted to accomidate groups using other than a Warrior as MT.  Quite frankly I am very tired of running these trials over and over.</div></div><hr />

The point is that prior to SoE saying anything you believed that such an ability was not game breaking / might actually help.<br />
Prior to SoE saying anything, I came to my senses and realized just how wrong this idea was. As I've stated subsequently - Knights lose tanking ability and DPS as a &quot;cost&quot; of having a spellbook. The spellbook should provide ways of regaining as much of this capability as SoE permits.<br />
<br />
The idea is wrong for two major reasons:<br />
<br />
1. It's a one click solution that mimics a Warrior defining ability that should not be shared.<br />
<br />
2. Instead of adressing spellbook shortcomings (size and casting times of heals, lost stun mitigation, etc) and providing in-class chararcter ways of regaining as much tanking ability and DPS capability as SoE permits, it creates a &quot;Warrior Defensive&quot; mode and inhibits the use of the spellbook. It's exactly wrong.<br />
The fact that SoE made a statement afterwards doesn't mean they're 100% right and players are 100% wrong<br />
The fact that SoE made a statement and will be taking action that doesn't result in Knights sharing a defining Warrior ability IS 100% right and those that disagree ARE 100% wrong. It's perfectly fine for us to disagree on this assertion. However the &quot;fix&quot; need not be to the detriment of Warriors and SoE is in the position of being able to make certain it isn't.<br />
<br />
Quibbling over who is right and who is wrong after SoE has decided is a little silly. It reminds me of children trying to continue a fight by saying &quot;Well she started it.&quot; &quot;Nuh uh, he started it!&quot; It's decided Taragor. They are fixing content. Woo woo! You are all set now. Yay!<br />
<br />
When mom (SoE) says you can't have a cookie (Knight Defensive) before dinner, she doesn't mean having a piece of cake (Defensive in sheep's clothing) is OK.<br />
<br />
It is this behavior that is being criticized. Some Paladins won't just accept a fix, they want (and are NOT entitled to) to share Defensive.<br />
<br />
[btw, I'm not &quot;without sin&quot; since I argued against &quot;-1 DI&quot; in favor of more HP's - Sturdiness didn't come till later, against the Provoke line and in favor of a resisted stun-like ability, and against Dancing Star Power Up's. Frodlin urged me to give it all a chance and I argued like mad instead.]<br />

<br />
**The following quote is from 1 week ago which is merely 3 days prior to the last Brenlo post**<br />
<br />
Oh, it's possible SoE IS looking at creating a Vie-like spell requiring frequent re-casting with the possibility of fizzles, interrupts, and outright bad timing making harder mobs doable but riskier when MT'd by Knights. I can't see why that would be a major problem so long as the mana cost was high enough that is couldn't be sustained when MTing raid boss mobs.<br />
<br />
It also came after the first Brenlo post and the debate about the speldat issue on lucy. <br />
<br />
<br />
The idea is wrong for two major reasons:<br />
<br />
1. It's a one click solution that mimics a Warrior defining ability that should not be shared.<br />
<br />

It's exactly wrong.<br />
<br />
I'm going to say this again. I was NOT debating the merits or drawbacks of the suggestion. <br />
<br />
<br />
The fact that SoE made a statement and will be taking action that doesn't result in Knights sharing a defining Warrior ability IS 100% right and those that disagree ARE 100% wrong. It's perfectly fine for us to disagree on this assertion. However the &quot;fix&quot; need not be to the detriment of Warriors and SoE is in the position of being able to make certain it isn't.<br />
<br />
a) SoE isn't giving knights new spells<br />
b) SoE isn't upgrading our current spellbooks to make our current spells functional<br />
c) Tuning down the content so that classes/player lvls that weren't suppose to be able to tank in PoP in the first place, but were fully capable of doing it (and better for short durations) isn't a fix</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gurgeh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">As a general comment, just like any PoN whine, your post contains no fact, just a few numbers you made out of your ass.<br />
<br />
So they had the feeling we are now 50% as effectiv as clerics. <br />
<br />
<br />
This is not true, as Brenlo stated they are perfectly aware that a shaman has roughly 50% of the healing power of a cleric (slightly less even). Would you want paladin to heal better than shaman ? Of course no, it wouldn't be fair. It's called class balance, an hybrid does not heal as well as a priest.  Developpers might be clueless, but no as much as you yet. You might argue they get it wrong on the number and that shaman healing 50% of a cleric is bullshit, but they do know numbers, much better than you.<br />
<br />
Out of defensiv you will mostly be between 15 to 5% better then a knight <br />
<br />
<br />
Out of defensive a paladin tank better than a warrior period, heals will easily make up for the 5%. Considering a paladin can heal a sustained 40 hp / sec you'd need to fight trash that average at 800 dps constantly to be behind a warrior in damage mitigation, and this is in the case where you fight constantly a mob, this never happen.<br />
Fact is that a paladin will require less healing than a war without defensive, therefore they mitigate better.<br />
<br />
Now even if theoricaly a paladin could heal 500 hp/sec for 80 sec, which would be more than enough to make up for defensive in ikkinz, they can't reach those numbers, not because of interrupt but because they would have trouble holding aggro while chain healing.<br />
<br />
Yet talking about damage mitigation without saying a word about paladin's heals is bullshit, you need to factor all the way a paladin can mitigate damage and not just say the paladin will just push auto attack on to tank.<br />
<br />
(I'm not even talking about mobs that can be stunned, in which case paladin just kill any other tank class at mitigating damage, and yes this is 2/3 of the GoD trash).<br />
<br />
Warrior get riposte to mitigate damage, paladin get LoH and HoP, warrior get defensive, paladin get LoO and LoN. Of course, and fortunately when a mob is hitting really hard, defensive is better than heals, but to be true said mob need to deal over 1000 dps.</div></div><hr />

Ok, you're confused I think. I have maintained some support for a Vie-like spell requiring frequent re-casting with the possibility of fizzles, interrupts, and outright bad timing making harder mobs doable but riskier when MT'd by Knights - a repacement for &quot;stun mitigation&quot;. I do not support Defensive in sheeps clothing (below) for the two reasons I gave:<br />
<br />
Aegis of the Knight<br />
Level: 65<br />
Casting time: 0<br />
Fizzle time: 0<br />
Refresh Time: 15<br />
Fizzle: No<br />
Interuptable: No<br />
Duration: 3 minutes or when mana runs out.<br />
Mana cost: 1800<br />
Upkeep cost: 35 per tick<br />
Reagent: Diamond or some other appropriate gem<br />
Effect: Would be similar to Bulwark of Vie, would not stack with it, and it would absorb 30% of incoming damge per hit, have no limit on each hit (besids the 30%) and have no total limit on hits absorbable (other than the spells duration). So would be 30/-/-.<br />
<br />
IMO any Vie-like buff should not depart much from a Cleric's Vie. Basicly it would require spamming yourself .<br />
<br />
However, having said this a better solution would be first to upgrade heals and the Chaneling Focus AA ability. If you can't justify spell revision to address MTing in trials, group self-reliance when addtanking. and raid role when not, then you are certainly in a bind. You are not entitled to share Defensive, a Warrior class defining ability. You are however IMO entitled to useful spells consistant with those already appearing in your spellbook.<br />
<br />
You seem ok with challanging SoE about Defensive, but not spellbook revision.<br />
Changing the content is a fix.<br />
<br />
Rather than debate Warriors (especially when you are dead wrong) it might be more productive to do a detailed analysis and write SoE OR check out new games that might be more in line with the sweeping changes you seem to want in this one.<br />

I was under the impression that knights were to be 75% warrior and 25% cleric, at least this was how Verant listed it way back. According to your numbers there , it does seem to be quite close to 25% cleric.<br />

Warriors like to say we are only 5% better because we get 5% more hps, better migration etc. Sorry to destroy your illusion. This dont create a 5% difference. This create a larger difference. Take in that you get hit for max less and we get hit for max more (parse show this) we create another penalty etc. which make us worser&quot;<br />

Hmm well i certianly hope were more than 5% better, arnt we supposed to be somewhere around 25% better?<br />

4  test hypothesis (create scenarios)<br />

6. RE-DO STEP 1-5 SHOULD ADDITIONAL DATA/CONTEXT COME AVAILABLE.  Better yet re-do it IF YOU DISCOVER SOME OF THE ASSUMPTIONS TO HAVE BEEN FOUND FALSE.<br />

Somehow in modern society the ability to have the intellectual flexibility to do step 6 has become equated with &quot;flip flop&quot; &quot;being untruthful&quot; hell even &quot;morally suspect&quot;.

You can repalce this with the exact kunark heals and manapools and you will see that paladins then was arround 15% healing of clerics in kunark. The warriors side was not that bad. We was not that far behind warriors in tanking but we was far, far behind them in dps then (pre 2h upgrades). <br />

The devs from today make the same only this time on our tanking side. They dont have a good unterstanding from the classes or the marketing people make the decision today and not the designers. Lets take there new project to balance pvp. I play on vallon and you can not balance pvp in everquest. It is impossible. Lets take warriors and knights. No warrior will be able to kill me in pvp. It is impossible if he dont have help from others. Your defensiv discipline you like that much is total useless there. Why because the 'encounter' is different. There answer to balance this unbalance will now not be that they make warriors equal to knights in pvp. They will make that the 'encounter' is different when you fight in the arena. They give warrior the 'aura of antiknight' but only when the fight is in a pvp arena. <br />

Knights have been wailing that the warrior upgrades will throw them back to the dark days of Kunark since before it even went Live.  Of course it's not true.  And you've convinced very few that this is just like Kunark.  Has it occurred to you that warriors aren't intended to be just 5% better at tanking?  I think the devs are well aware that 5% mitigation (it isn't, it's more like 3-4%) plus 5% hit points (which is debateable), etc. do not add up to 5%.</div></div><hr />

 Guess what paladins tank a whole lot better than 75% compared to a warrior, and i blame the dev's for that. So give it up ,  accept the class you CHOSE and learn how to make the most of it.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I, too, have &quot;given this some thought&quot;.<br />
<br />
I will be up front and frank and admit that I have absolutely no say in this.  You can check my magelo.  I'm an officer of a guild that has only been in the elementals for three months and has barely scratched the surface for what the elementals offer.  GoD is a secondary thought to me, and after being jumped over by a small raid force when my group was 5 kills away from getting to a mini, the expansion has left an overall distaste in my mouth.<br />
<br />
But I can read and observe.<br />
<br />
The biggest thing I see the Knight vs Warrior discrepancies in tanking, mostly from the single group trials that people constantly bitch and complain about.  I'll give it to ya.  They're probably pretty awful and I feel for the warriors who have to sit and hold everyone's hand as they pass everyone through them.  I read again and again how the dps of the mobs are generally way too high for any non-warrior to effectively tank.  This honestly sounds more content oriented than anything, and I don't think it's a good idea to &quot;fix&quot; it by class balance, especially by giving Knights a form of Defensive.  After all, as I've said before, that after the warrior changes, you never hear of Warrior vs Knight tanking differences in PoP.  <br />
<br />
So how do you change the content to give all three knight classes an equal challenge, all while remaining difficult so that only certain can pass them?  Come on people.  Giving a mob that's made to be beaten by a single group that quads for 2500 is not the *only* way to make shit challenging.  I've single grouped many encounters with my friends and I can say almost every mob is unique in every manner.  Giving them high damage output values than fucking pantheon gods is retarded, especially since pantheon gods are full fledge raid force mobs and these are meant to be single grouped.  By doing that, it's mixing the three roles that I believe make up the tank classes that, since GoD, have been pretty well balanced for the most part.<br />
<br />
What roles?<br />
<br />
It doesn't take too much observation that SoE has created three different tanking roles for Warriors, Shadowknights, and Paladins to chew on.  These roles are:<br />
<br />
1)  Exp tanking<br />
-This is tanking while you're grinding those AAs away.  The mob difficulty varies per expansion, but are generally tuned for the gear that drops elsewhere in the expansion and/or zone.  <br />
<br />
2)  Raid trash tanking<br />
-This is where the roles of Knights and Warriors start becoming more defined.  Since GoD, Knights have generally filled this role better than their Warrior counter parts.  Mobs here, take PoE-B for example, hit harder than your standard exp mob does.  The balance is that you're here with a raid force and with much more healing power, buffs, and numbers at your disposal.  Knights work well here because they can grab agro very quickly and hold it.  Warriors can do this job very nicely as well.<br />
<br />
3)  Raid boss tanking<br />
-These are your Reparms, your Blazzaxes, your Mob_009 that hits harder, faster, and more deadly then you thought imaginable.  This is where the lines become clean cut.  Knights do not and never have belonged here, though there are some raid boss mobs where Knights do the job more effectively.  These, however, are few and far between.  This is fuckin' warrior territory, and what makes this territory warrior only are our defensive (Defensive, Stonewall, Evasive) disciplines.<br />
<br />
The problem as I see it is that SoE is beginning to mix #3 with #1, and we've yet to see this since the release of GoD.  How can you possibly expect a non warrior to stand up to a mob that is built in mind for warrior tanking only?  The fact is, it just doesn't work.  It isn't the classes that need balancing here.  It's the goddamn content.  <br />
<br />
So, that leads me to my next question.  How do you possibly make content extremely challenging for all three tanking classes in mind?  After all, you're expected to defeat these trials with a #1 setup.  You don't go after Reparm with just haste, virtue, and focus, and two clerics, do you you?  No, that's be pretty retarded, and that's the frustrating Knights are facing.<br />
<br />
Think outside the box.  I'm going to pick three different named I have single grouped and I will compare the differences (and similarities) as to what made them difficult.  All, I believe, are relatively on the same level.  Some of this is VERY old school to you guys, but hear me out.  I'm simply using them as an example.<br />
<br />
1)  Derakor the Vindicator<br />
2)  Guardian of the Seal<br />
3)  Korucust<br />
<br />
All three, I believe, are equally challenging in their own very unique ways.<br />
<br />
-What makes Derakor the Vindicator challenging for a single group effort?  For one, you have to split him.  This isn't too difficult and you can even get by with a druid/ranger who can snare both guards and kite Vindi around while you take care of the guards first.  You also have to deal with respawns.  It sucks when you're under the clock, even despite those respawns are light blues.  Any green can interrupt a CH, however.  So you finally get Vindi.  What's hard about this?  For a single group, this is an Endurance fight.  Any raid can quickly dispose of Vindi in short order, but for a single group, those 200k HP take some time to burn down.  You're under the clock to beat Vindis HP before the cleric runs out of mana.  It's hella challenging and if you're group isn't well equipped enough to this, you will lose every single time.  There's no way around it.<br />
<br />
-Guardian of the Seal.  This is a mob who I think runs parallel with the style of mobs that are fought in the trials.  Super low hitpoints and super high damage output.  What makes it even more interesting is when Guardian gets low on hp, he changes forms and starts AEing.  How's that for changing shit around, eh?  Generally, in all the times I have singled grouped this guy, once my Defensive disc wore off, chances are I would die.  Kill before disc ends.  This is your furious style fight.<br />
<br />
-Korucust.  Korucust is a very interesting fight and I think many of us can agree.  Have ya ever single grouped him before?  Ok, I admit, I actually did this with 7 (bard oog).  But what makes Korucust hard is not his damage output, it's the AEs and need to for team work to make sure they're cured.  It was certainly a longer fight as our attention was often shifted from healing to curing, from curing to healing, and once the heals set in, back to dps.  It took a lot of strategy involved to finally sketched out our roles and what exactly we needed to do, and afterword we felt like a well oiled Ferrari motor just waiting to go full throttle and scream.  <br />
<br />
So those are just my three examples, although admittingly they are archaic to a lot of us.  Still, the models are irrelevant to content.  Not all single group content *HAS* to fit the furious style model.  There are plenty of ways to make mobs challenging and fun and beatable by only the top tier without giving them outragious raid level boss mob dps values.  That's retarded.<br />
<br />
So, my conclusion is, I think we're all wasting our breathe.  Knights are fine.  The content just needs to be adjusted to provide a broader range of mob difficulties, not just one.<br />

Ok, you're confused I think. I have maintained some support for a Vie-like spell requiring frequent re-casting with the possibility of fizzles, interrupts, and outright bad timing making harder mobs doable but riskier when MT'd by Knights - a repacement for &quot;stun mitigation&quot;. I do not support Defensive in sheeps clothing (below) for the two reasons I gave:<br />
<br />
What part of my original/second/third post did you not understand when I said I wasn't debating the suggested ability, that I was merely pointing out the flip flopping you repeatedly do. <br />
<br />
<br />
IMO any Vie-like buff should not depart much from a Cleric's Vie. Basicly it would require spamming yourself .<br />
<br />
However, having said this a better solution would be first to upgrade heals and the Chaneling Focus AA ability. If you can't justify spell revision to address MTing in trials, group self-reliance when addtanking. and raid role when not, then you are certainly in a bind. You are not entitled to share Defensive, a Warrior class defining ability. You are however IMO entitled to useful spells consistant with those already appearing in your spellbook.<br />
<br />
Heals were never meant as one of our tanking tools. They were created for our secondary role. Channeling focus would help if we had actual viable tanking spells for GoD. I can't justify spell revision because the ONLY revision would be to make our stuns work on mobs they have NEVER worked on. So tell me. Should SoE give us stuns that work on ALL mobs that could potentially COMPLETELY unbalance the game, or should they look at another mitigating ability be it by disc/aa/spell? See the point. Vie/Stun/Def all lead to the same thing, and no matter WHAT SoE does to YOU if it means we can tank better in GoD (I said tank BETTER which means the classes are UPGRADED not the content DOWNGRADED) it's an unacceptable solution. So now, what is this about your vie buff?<br />

I DID say he was consistent. He's consistent in changing his mind every 2 days or at any show that something he mentionned may actually be CONSIDERED. I'm not sure if you recall but a post or 2 after his original VIE idea he said something to the effect (paraphrasing) *But I know knights will NEVER accept this because it's not defensive* When knights (this was on PoN btw) looked at what his suggestion was, thought about it, and then asked him a few specifics in regards to a few things he said and *suggested* a few tweaks, his following post was (paraphrasing) *no way, I came to my senses, knights are balanced, they don't need ANYTHING, stop bitching etc etc etc*. I would agree with you 100% that anything BB has ever stated about warrior upgrades or that lead to warrior supremecy he's been consistent on 100% of the time.

We was not that far behind warriors in tanking but we was far, far behind them in dps then (pre 2h upgrades). <br />
<br />
The devs from today make the same only this time on our tanking side. They dont have a good unterstanding from the classes or the marketing people make the decision today and not the designers. ....<br />
<br />
<br />
Im so glad you understand it so well.  Im glad we finally have someone that knows the &quot;marketing people&quot; and &quot;designers&quot; personally and can explain to us how class balancing works.  Paladins arent supposed to be 50% cleric - in that case they would be 50% warrior right? I doubt you would be happy with that.<br />
<br />
<br />
Heals were never meant as one of our tanking tools. They were created for our secondary role. <br />
An intelligent player learns to wield his powers to his advantage - and just because you dont assume they arent meant to be an advantage doesnt mean thats how they were designed.<br />
<br />
Would be interesting to see how warriors would react to having knights tank 75% like warriors undisced but get 75% of the power of warrior defensive/offensive discs. Would only make us 75% warrior now wouldn't it? <br />
<br />
Talk about flawed logic.<br />
<br />
You are correct, this is flawed logic.  I was under the assumption that the most accepted number that a warrior tanks better then a knigth w/o defensive on is around 12 1/2 percent... thats before you factor in heals/stuns.  So in this case a paladin tanks pre defensive 88% as well as a warrior no? How do you see gaining 75% of defensive as making this number go down?</div></div><hr />

I said it wasn't a tanking tool, not that it couldn't be cast while tanking. Tanking tool as in *dmg mitigation*. IE: What our stuns do. Or for the more vocal ppl stuns create damage avoidance.<br />

I didn't say currently it would. I was asking how would warriors feel about having knights non disc tanking being brought down to 75% of warriors but then granted 75% power of warrior tanking discs. Was only pointing out a flaw in the belief that knights are fully 85% warrior. We are in an xp setting, we aren't once a disc is activated.</div></div><hr />

I agree that when a disc is active, a paladin doesnt tank like he is 88% warrior - but hes NOT 88% warrior.<br />

Paladins were not meant to be 88% warrior, and thats why warriors GOT defensive.  In original everquest the extra hp bonus a warrior got was more of an advanatage, as the game progressed and that gap closed, mitigation was altered to make up for it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>arbosch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Well even you guys which post here dont calculate it right. We are 75% warriors and you think 87,5 % tanking and so we are to good.<br />
<br />
It dont make us to a 87,5% warrior. Why because warrior has two side. Tanking and DPS. The not so smart people here like we see from the post wil now say then we need 75% of the tanking tools and 75% of the dps to be equal to the 75% we should be. This is what we knights call 'doudble penalty'. Something most of you dont know what it is. To explain it a 3. time and now i hope all you unterstand it is this.<br />
<br />
If a warrior has 1000hps and is only 75% as effectiv. He has to get 75% hps and both take the same damage. Then the knight die exactly 75% faster then the knight. I hope everyone agree with this. If the knight take more damage then the warrior he is worser then 75% because he will die even faster.<br />
<br />
Now if the knight is allready 75% at tanking you create a double penalty when you think he need to be only 75% of the dps of warriors. Lets take this numbers to make it easy for you (Warrior 1000hps, Warrior 100dps, Mob 1000hps, Mob 100dps. We take a 10 sec. fight to make it even easier for you guys here to unterstand complex thinking. <br />
<br />
In the fight with a warrior in this 10 seconds. The mob will have 0hps, the warrior will have 0hps after this 10 seconds. Now take the knight with your thinking of 75% dps and 75% tanking. You will have this. The knight will be at -250hps and the mob will have 250hps left. This make a 500hps difference and not the 250 which it should be to be 75% as effectiv as a warrior. Warrior is dps and tanking and we should be 75% as effectiv there. So to be a 75% warrior we need a 87,5% tanking of a warrior and 87,5% of the dps of a warrior and we are 75% as effectiv as the warrior. Then we we will have -125 hps after the 10 seconds and the mob is at 125 hps left which make the 250hps which it should be. Or take 100% taning and 75% dps and we are 75% as effectiv as warriors. Or 75% tanking and 100% dps and we are 75% as effectiv. <br />
<br />
The only thing you see from this discussion is that warriors dont unterstand the problem with the 'double penaltys' and knights get hurt because the new designer crew allso dont unterstand this. Something the old designer learned when they checked out why knights are that weak in kunark and found out the probem come from 'double penaltys' where they had the feeling that they can balance single parts and so created double penaltys because some values are + and some are negativ (dps/tanking) and when you will have 25% difference when values are + and - you can not only but a 25% penatly on the single parts and come out with 25% penalty. They get stacked up everytime you create a 25% penalty and the values swtich from positiv effect (dps) to a negativ effect (tanking). <br />
<br />
Well berhaps some warriors here are smart enough to find out what this mean or you can make yourself more to a clown and come up with &quot;knights are to strong bcause we are now 87,5% of a warrior in tanking and 87,5% of a warriors dps and that make us to strong. They should be 75% of the warriors tanking and 75% of the warriors dps&quot;. Well the smart warriors which just found out how wrong they are will now go edit there posts. The not so smart warriors will try to come up with something else. But remember this is without looking at discipline. If he can create 10-20% more dps with disciplines and 20%-40% better tanking with disciplines it create a double penaltys again which make us even worser. Special for raids where this tools are double effectiv.<br />
<br />
Wonder which warriors which posted here now will unterstand this an which will not unterstand it...<br />

It appears that there is absolutely nothing that would make you happy with the Paladin class short of making it heal like a Cleric, tank like a Warrior, and probably kite like a Bard and charm like an Enchanter.  You really really need to go find another game to play, before you do something rash in your despair over EQ, seriously.  Hell, I couldn't even get past the first paragraph in this last message of yours because it was so full of doom and gloom and how Paladins are the despised red-headed bastard children of the EQ world, when it just isn't true.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wars have 2 sides: tanking and DPS.  You're correct.<br />
<br />
Knights have 3 sides: tanking, DPS, and spells.<br />
<br />
According to you, knights have 75% of our tanking abilities and 75% of our DPS (do you include spell damage?).<br />
<br />
On the flip side (again using your numbers), wars have 25% better tanking, 25% better dps.... and 0% of your spells.<br />

He's using the &quot;New Paladin Math&quot;.  That's the math that you use when calculating that when a Ranger takes more DPS than a Paladin that he is are actually tanking &quot;better&quot; than the Paladin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Selaradrid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">To me, this is not a debate over content, or balance, or abilities. it is simply a &quot;warriors got upgrades, now where are ours?&quot;<br />
<br />
Yes it is true. warriors got aggro upgrades. they were needed. Wars thought they were needed. Devs thought they were needed. knights thought they were needed, heck Everyone thought they were needed.<br />
<br />
and those upgrades WORKED. they restored balance.  Everything before gates is pretty much balanced IMO in the area of which tank to use. this is how it should be.  Paladins do not need a major overhaul to become viable again. some changes, sure why not, they could use them, but drastic changes? hell no<br />
<br />
since warriors just recieved upgrades to create the balance, wouldnt a major upgrade to knights once again destroy that balance? of course it would. so what are you really asking for here?<br />
<br />
now to the gates debate. the majority of you palidins whining about gates are not even in Gates! you are simply jumping on it as a rallying point to curse SOE and demand changes that would once again make you guys the premier tanking class. you complained that knights cant tank in GoD. ( a legitimate concern and I support you in this) SOE is looking into it. (which is exactly what you asked for) but now it seems you will not get upgrades to fix this, they will change the content. WTF is the problem then? your getting what you wanted and what you deserve to have. Im sorry, i dont see the issue.<br />
<br />
maybe I am just uninformed, but if someone can show me legitimate concerns on why Paladins need sweeping changes like a defensive like disc (that would affect all of EQ and not just GoD) then ok, i would consider it and make my opinion from there. but as it stands, i beleive you are getting not only what you asked for, but what you actually need as well, so asking for more is not warranted.<br />
<br />
oh and absorch. you really really need to take a break from EQ or something dude. seriously, I worry about you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">and again, arbosch, you totally ignore how your spells complement your tanking side. And this is how your spells only benefit YOU, let alone the rest of your party. None of which a warrior can do, and that's a whole new can of worms on all the things that a paladin can bring to the table to help his party out, while warriors only do ONE thing, and that's tank. Course, I believe you're one of the ones that thinks the Paladin spellset is &quot;useless&quot;, so I doubt you would even agree with things like, oh, say... group doesn't have a rezzer, and needs a tank. Gee, what do we grab? not a warrior! grab a paladin, he can tank AND rez... which is just one of many scenarios where paladins do get groups by having that spellbook in addition to being able to tank. <br />
<br />
But anyway, let's look at all the things where your spellbook complements your tanking, which you conveniently seem to have forgotten:<br />
<br />
Stuns: oh look, you mitigate damage. Compliments your tanking side, making you a better tank. You ignore that little fact, probably because it doesn't support your point of view.<br />
<br />
Heals: Oh look, you healed the damage you took. Complements your tanking side, allowing you to survive longer without heals. Again, this little fact is ignored.<br />
<br />
Root: Look, you can prevent ALL damage for a significant period of time. Lasts longer, but is also resisted more. Helps you survive in some situations where a warrior would die. Do you acknowledge this? Of course not.<br />
<br />
Buffs: Situationally, you can situationally max, and sometimes EXCEED what a warrior would have for hitpoints, were he to be that group instead of you. Yet another fact which is conveniently ignored in your complaining about how &quot;bad off paladins have it&quot;.<br />
<br />
If you have it that bad for warriors and think paladins suck so much, roll a freakin warrior up. Your whining about how bad paladins supposedly have it, while only selectively using arguments, trumping up ones that support your point of view, but utterly ignoring facts that don't... All it's doing is destroying any credibility you have and painting you as just another whining paladin. Tell me, do you WANT to be known as that, and having anything you say basically dismissed out of hand as extremely biased, or do you actually want to have your voice listened to and given some credit?<br />
<br />
That choice is ENTIRELY up to you.</div></div><hr />

Sitting to pull a mob out of a wall is a tanking tool =-P Being able to heal yourself IS a tanking tool. Saying that only flat out mitigation/discs are tanking tools, and knights gain no advantage tanking for the spells/benefits of being a knight is a joke.<br />
<br />
We going to use semantics now?<br />
<br />
Try this on for size. Envision a mob that hits for 10k dmg. Now envision a paladin casting 10k worth of heals PRIOR to the mob hitting him so he can *mitigate* the dmg. Doesn't work well now does it. :P<br />
<br />
My point about the heals is their primary purpose is for secondary role purposes. They're not there as any mitigation factor. Obviously they can be used at this time (success rate lowers as you get into higher content) but it's not their primary purpose. If it were, knights would be casting heals on each fight, against each mob, and it would actually serve a purpose. Trust me when I say casting ToN or LoN when reparn decides to swing at my head will serve little purpose.<br />
<br />
I agree that when a disc is active, a paladin doesnt tank like he is 88% warrior - but hes NOT 88% warrior.<br />
<br />
Where did I say 88%? <br />
<br />
<br />
Paladins were not meant to be 88% warrior, and thats why warriors GOT defensive.  In original everquest the extra hp bonus a warrior got was more of an advanatage, as the game progressed and that gap closed, mitigation was altered to make up for it.<br />
<br />
The number that's been thrown around since the dawn of time is 75%. In an xp setting it's greater than 75% but then rangers/beastlords tank better than 75% on those same mobs as well.<br />
<br />
On named unstunnable mobs that *have* to be tanked with a discipline knights are 0%. (note the *'s on each side of the word have) Which is a far cry from us being 75% warrior. <br />
<br />
If you take our tanking % from xp mobs and add it to our tanking % from raid mobs (at current content level not trivial level) then divide that by 2 (2 factors based on 100% is divided to yield a % based on 100%) we are far from being 75% warriors. <br />
<br />
All this being said knights should NOT tank to 75% capacity of a warrior when facing raid mobs (raid mobs being the named / raid meaning not 1 group), but being 0% in all seriousness is also not acceptable. The fact that knights have had no mitigation abilities since the beginning of EQ has little to do with it. Since the beginning of EQ warriors have had to rely on taunt for aggro purposes only. It was proven as expansions came out and content became harder that taunt just didn't cut it anymore. Well it's being proven with expansions where content is becoming harder that 0% mitigation just isn't going to cut it anymore.</div></div><hr />

No, actually it hasn't been proven at all.  It's been stated over and over again by Knights with little or no evidence to substantiate that other than &quot;cause we want it&quot;.  SoE is working on fixing the content problem in GoD.  And that's basically the end of it.</div></div><hr />

Last time I checked paladin could tank just fine PoTime god.<br />
A paladin can tank most ikkinz RAID named (as well as single group trial), they can tank trash in uqua. But this is not enough a paladin should be able to tank the remaining 3 / 4 mobs, isn't ?<br />
<br />
No mitigation ability ? stun heal ? it's not mitigation ? what is it ?<br />

You obviously don't know what you are talking about, you have not seen ikkinz in anything but screenshot, how can you state that a knight can't tank there ?</div></div><hr />

You tell us that we should only be 75% as effectiv as warriors on our melee side and we should be silent because we tank near 87,5% as good as you and are still overpowered. Now i show you that this is okay but effectiv we are only 75% allready (when we dont look at disciplines which are very, very usefull in God) because we have lower dps then warriors and so we are effectiv at 75% and now you come up with. But we have spells and so we need do be even worser then 75%. Tell me which % we have to be to be balanced against warriors. You can allways come up with but we can rezz. That is godlike against what you can do. That is true. But how much % we have to be worser then warriors to be balanced. I show you how to calculate it and want an answer from you. Should we be only 50% as effectiv as warriors. So lets say we tank 75% as good and have 75% dps of a warrior which make us 50% as effectiv as warriors. Tell me please which % numbers we have to be from a warrior with our spells we have that we are balanced. Balance is nothing else then a big mathematic calculation where you try to bring different values in a balance. Balance isnt a feeling where you take stuff a and stuff b and let your feeling tell you what is balance.<br />
<br />
That we are less then 25% as effectiv as a cleric is something i can prove you very easy if it is needed. So if we are effectiv only 25% as effectiv on our casting side as clerics and only 75% of a warrior are we not balanced?<br />
<br />
You will be balanced without looking at the disciplines and take them as 'special' things which are warrior only and you take our spells as our special stuff which balance your special stuff. But the same time you say but our spells are not only special stuff. They are allso have to looked at when we balance both classes because they are part of the knights. So you take our 25% casting side as excuse to keep the disciplines that unbalanced. That is where the problem is. Disciplines are total broken. If you will have that our 25% casting side balance your disciplines they have to be more then 25% that we are balanced. We have to be 25% casting + worth of disciplines + 75% melee to be balanced against 100% warrrior + disciplines. At the moment we are only 25%casting+75% warrior against 100% warrior + disciplines.<br />

Tell me please which % numbers we have to be from a warrior with our spells we have that we are balanced. Balance is nothing else then a big mathematic calculation where you try to bring different values in a balance. Balance isnt a feeling where you take stuff a and stuff b and let your feeling tell you what is balance.<br />
<br />
That we are less then 25% as effectiv as a cleric is something i can prove you very easy if it is needed. So if we are effectiv only 25% as effectiv on our casting side as clerics and only 75% of a warrior are we not balanced?<br />
<br />
You will be balanced without looking at the disciplines and take them as 'special' things which are warrior only and you take our spells as our special stuff which balance your special stuff. But the same time you say but our spells are not only special stuff. They are allso have to looked at when we balance both classes because they are part of the knights. So you take our 25% casting side as excuse to keep the disciplines that unbalanced. That is where the problem is. Disciplines are total broken. If you will have that our 25% casting side balance your disciplines they have to be more then 25% that we are balanced. We have to be 25% casting + worth of disciplines + 75% melee to be balanced against 100% warrrior + disciplines. At the moment we are only 25%casting+75% warrior against 100% warrior + disciplines.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Gurgeh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">You make absolutely no sense at all Arbosh. <br />
First of all in terms of heal, a paladin is somewhere between 38% and 52% of a cleric (38% is sustained healing, and 52% is burst healing) don't know how you came to 25%.<br />
<br />
But more important, why shouldn't be spell factored in tanking abitilty ? Except to make numbers looks better in favor of warriors when it's not the case. <br />
You need to compare Paladin mitigation + spell vs Warrior  mitigation (+ discipline) and here's the result :<br />
<br />
Mob can be stunned  Paladin &gt; Warrior with defensive<br />
Mob is immune to stun Paladin &gt; Warrior without defensive<br />
Mob is immune to stun and has less than 1000 dps Paladin &gt; Warrior with defensive<br />
Mob is immune to stun and has more than 1000 dps Paladin &lt; Warrior<br />
<br />
Now just because on some (rare) mobs paladin &lt; warrior, it does not mean paladin can't tank, it just mean it's harder.<br />
<br />
Really I would like to know the name of mobs that [b]can't[b] be tanked by a paladin, I could end up with maybe 3 / 4 names top of 4 hitters in GoD, and fight are so fast that in fact, you could probably have paladin tank them with DI going off every 3 rounds ...</div></div><hr />

so, because they are for your secondary role, this means they cant and dont help you with your primary role?<br />
<br />
Warriors dont have a secondary role. so whats the point of this again?<br />
<br />
and no, that isnt sarcasm. what is the point of this?<br />
<br />
Basically yes. Or do you attune me using rez while tanking as a primary role function? :)<br />
<br />
Remember we're discussing raid lvl named tanking here. IE: THe reparn example. <br />
<br />
<br />
Glatius:<br />
<br />
No, actually it hasn't been proven at all. It's been stated over and over again by Knights with little or no evidence to substantiate that other than &quot;cause we want it&quot;. SoE is working on fixing the content problem in GoD. And that's basically the end of it.<br />
<br />
For starters I didn't say it was proven, I said it was being proven. Or do you have another explanation for SoE tuning down content?<br />
<br />
Sure they tune it down, ok fine, makes it easier for warriors. But all that asside.<br />
<br />
Interestingly enough the majority of the players that play the 3 plate tanks that are in the content *don't* want them dumbed down. Why? Because they want difficulty, they want challenge, they don't want more mind numbing repetitive same as 5 expansion old strategies. That's the difference in balancing classes and making content easier.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Gurgeh:<br />
<br />
No mitigation ability ? stun heal ? it's not mitigation ? what is it ?<br />
<br />
You obviously don't know what you are talking about, you have not seen ikkinz in anything but screenshot, how can you state that a knight can't tank there ?<br />
<br />
And you're saying I don't know what I'm talking about? Care to name me the named mobs in the game that aren't stun immune?<br />
<br />
You're right, players that have been in the highest end guilds since the inception of high lvl guilds have no clue what they're talking about. Oh, and have you forgotten that SoE itself has said they need to tune down content because it isn't balanced to the 3 plate tanks currently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">Arbosch,<br />
<br />
While I don't agree with you, you've been fairly polite. Thus I'll try to give you a real answer.<br />
<br />
The 75%/25% numbers game is only useful in the most general sense possible.<br />
<br />
A different way of looking at 75% would be that for 75% of the mobs in the game a Paladin can tank indistinguishably from a Warrior. That surely isn't a fair way to use that number. Neither is 75% Defensive for Knights.<br />
<br />
Ignoring other foolish and unproductive arguments what we arrive at is:<br />
<br />
Warriors and Knights must be equally acceptable to tank normal experiance groups. All three tanks should be able to get flags in one group content.<br />
<br />
The majority of one group loot dropping mobs should be tankable by Knights. At any given time a small percentage of these mobs should virtually require a Warrior. This is a Warrior marginal advantage which guarantees Warriors groups despite the fact that in most groups a Knight can tank just fine AND has a spellboook.<br />
<br />
Warriors are greatly prefered as raid MT's. In raids, Knights should be able to tank normal adds and provide other valuable services. Offtanking red splits and especially hard hitting adds remains an area where Warriors are prefered.<br />
<br />
Some samll percentage of raid boss mobs may be Knight prefered if they depart from normal mob abilities and interfer with a Warrior MTing them. As players gear up during an expansion, some mobs that were formerly strongly Warrior prefered become MTable by Knights.<br />
<br />
Note that everything I've said, agree with it or not, is afaik consistant with PoP. None of it requires that either Warriors lose Defensive or Knights share it. This is how things have been done for four years. When an expansion, like GoD, departs from these expectaions then either SoE must have and provide a good reason OR the content needs to be adjusted (a notable exception was Veshan's Peak. SoE did not provide an explanation, just a Warning. The zone is HARD. GM's will not help you if you die in there.)<br />
<br />
Warriors are intended to be the Primary Tank much as Clerics are intended to be the Prime Healer. Like it or not, Warriors are intended to tank better than Knights. One of the ways they tank better is by the use of Defensive, which confines their superiority to raid quality high DI mobs so as not to give Warriors absolute superiority in normal experiance groups and normal add tanking as well.<br />
<br />
Paladins WERE overpowered in LoY, PoP, and LDoN when compared to Warriors. The Phase 1 Melee Update was provided in order to help restore pure melee to their proper balance.<br />
<br />
Some mobs are overpowered in GoD. SoE will be adjusting them to restore proper mob vs. player balance.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry if such answers do not please you, but I've tried to be consistant with Brenlos' statements, previous statements by Absor, and the way EQ has been for 4 years. If tanking a mob requires a Warrior to use Defensive, then that mob is Warrior preferred. It's up to SoE to decide where such mobs are and are not appropriate.<br />

<br />
Ah ? I fail to see any Paladin like this around, you should ask them to plead for your cause, because the more we dig, the more we find that developpers were indeed right on class balance. And whatever they could state, you need fact to back what you say. You are failing at providing ANY kind of data that would show paladin do need an upgrade, you're just crying like babies : I need an upgrade because X said he could not tank in ikkinz trial. Which is wrong. <br />
<br />
Do you deny paladin can tank every single mob in PoP ?<br />
Do you deny paladin can tank Ikkinz single group named ?<br />
Do you deny paladin can tank Uqua's Trash ?<br />
<br />
No you don't, because it has been done, and will be done again.<br />
<br />
Ah and again it's cool to say again and again that named are immune to stun but you STILL can mitigate damage by healing yourself, and no this is not as negligible as you would like us to believe, why shouldn't this be taken into account ?<br />
<br />
You need to compare paladin + spell to mitigate damage with warrior + disc, this is what I did, you can check the result, and it seems ok to me, doesn't they to you ?</div></div><hr />

The only thing you see from this discussion is that warriors dont unterstand the problem with the 'double penaltys' and knights get hurt because the new designer crew allso dont unterstand this.<br />
<br />
<br />
You are saying the dps is done more then 25% gap?  Parse it in game, i dont think you are right.  If you really think the main course description of a warrior is dps, i dont think i should be wasteing my time even replying to this post.<br />
<br />
I think what you dont understand is you are 75% warrior and 25% cleric by theory.  You get these double benefits. (note the period)  Benefits come with downsides. (note the period)<br />
<br />
<br />
We going to use semantics now?<br />
<br />
Try this on for size. Envision a mob that hits for 10k dmg. Now envision a paladin casting 10k worth of heals PRIOR to the mob hitting him so he can *mitigate* the dmg. Doesn't work well now does it. :P<br />
<br />
My point about the heals is their primary purpose is for secondary role purposes. They're not there as any mitigation factor. Obviously they can be used at this time (success rate lowers as you get into higher content) but it's not their primary purpose. If it were, knights would be casting heals on each fight, against each mob, and it would actually serve a purpose. Trust me when I say casting ToN or LoN when reparn decides to swing at my head will serve little purpose.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have a 65 paladin.  If you are saying your fast cast heals are restricted so that you cannot use them in battle, you are obviously not that skilled.  I did not find trouble using TAB then heal hotkey after a round of hits.  When a cheal is going to land on my warrior a little late, sometimes i wish i still had that ability to TAB and heal myself.  Saying its a secondary purpose i would agree, you are more geared to be a tank then a cleric.  Saying that it cant be used in battle, well id say you need to gain skill in your class.  Dont even start the arguement of &quot;omgz i cant hold aggro if I heal myself!1111!one!&quot; because i know better ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
[QUOTE=Taragor]<br />
The fact that knights have had no mitigation abilities since the beginning of EQ has little to do with it. [QUOTE]<br />
<br />
I would go as far as to say stun is a mitigation ability.  I know i know it doesnt work on boss mobs because it would trvialize them - thats not a problem other then when they make those boss mobs hit too hard and one groupable. realize that.<br />
<br />
If knights are supposed to be 75% warrior - if a fully equipped time warrior is stretching his limits to tank something, then a paladin shoudlnt be able to tank it by 25% right?</div></div><hr />

<br />
It come back to this. You see that knights have it bad and most agree with this. You think the make some mobs weaker will solve the problem. Yes it will solve te problem but not the unbalance which exist. If they remake every mob and go back to the PoP design that mobs have 3times the hps and hit only half as hard as they do we have balance. Because then you have a 3time longer fight and the migration difference is way lower then it is now. PoP neutralized disciplines because the fight simple gone to long that that disciplines made a very, very small difference. GoD are fast and hard fights which make disciplines very, very usefull. To change 3 or 4 mobs will not do anything in GoD then make it little knight friendly. But aslong the fights are fast and hard it make disciplines very usefull and knights simple dont have any disciplines which are usefull and this unbalance will allways exist aslong they dont redo our disciplines. They can give us a ranger clone weaponshield discipline which will help us and make us better then rangers which we are not at the moment for this fights because the short time of the fight. 100% immun for 24sec. and for 24sec only 30% worser (ranger) then warriors is better then 48sec. 12,5% worser then warriors. Special because the dmg spikes. The ranger has 24 save secs. and then 24 where he has a high risk to die. But the knight has 48secs. where he has a high risk to die. So the statment that in PoP everything was okay and so only the 3 or 4 mobs which make knights troubles need to get tuned down to get balance back is not correct. They have to balance discipline for knights or make disciplines less usefull like it was in PoP then we have balance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u71"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p71">Arbosch, if the fights are fast and hard, defensive is only going to be helpful part of the time.  The rest of the time it will be useless because it's refreshing.  If the Warrior can survive without it, he won't be using it.  And if he can't, then people will be standing around waiting for it to refresh all the time.  Somehow I doubt that's what is happening in most of GoD, are people standing around fighting only one mob every 10 minutes?  Hard to believe.<br />
<br />
And SoE hasn't said they'll be changing only 3 or 4 mobs.  What I see them saying is that they're going to review the content and change all the mobs they see as a problem.<br />
<br />
If you think a weaponshield like discipline is going to help the Knights, I have no real arguement against it.  But don't expect it to have a long duration like you're suggesting.  Most of these disciplines last 2 ticks, or a total of 12 seconds.  The beastlord, monk and warrior ones are all 12 seconds.  You may get 18, but I'd be surprised if you got 24 seconds, double what most other classes get.</div></div><hr />

You fight a named which hit hard and which is way easier with disciplinetanking and then you fight a long, long time weaker trashmobs and wait that the named pop again. So you dont have to wait that it refresh. You simple kill mobs in that time which are easier and let the timer run up on this mobs and us it again for the hard mob. So the reuse time is not a real penalty. You dont need to wait you can go on only with weaker mobs untill it pop again.<br />

While we are at it, what does a man have to do around here to get sharks with frickin lazer beams?<br />

Paladins do not need defensive to tank in PoP, hard LDoN, LoY, Luclin, Kunark, original everquest.  GoD content is being looked into, so soon paladins wont need defensive to tank one group GoD content.  If you think the only way to fix the few one group encounters in GoD is to give paladins a scaled down form of defensive i would say wait for the content to be changed before you come to this conclusion.]<br />
<br />

<br />
Exactly, so you don't need every mob changed, just the ones that hit the hardest, right?  Knights aren't having problems with the trash, or are you claiming that they are?  Which is it?  All the mobs hit so hard that defensive is always necessary or only a few hit that hard and the rest are tankable by Knights, so only a relative few mobs need changes?<br />
<br />
This seems like an attempt to blow the problem out of proportion.  It's not every mob.  It's not even the majority of mobs.  It's a relative handful of mobs scattered around.  And the reason that everyone is so gunho to take them on is because they drop loot or give flags.  You don't have a mitigation problem anywhere near the scale you're claiming you do, apparently in an attempt to justify a major Knight enhancement.<br />
<br />
You're not understanding or your refusing to accept that adjusting a relative handful of mobs that are giving Knights grief in GoD is far preferable  in many ways to slapping a major enhancement on Knights that will drastically change class balance and deprive Warriors of one of their major class defining distinctions.  It would have all sorts of impact to the game outside of GoD.  And it could potentially have detrimental impact to the Warrior class in its raid role, either now or in the future.  Something like defensive isn't just useable for one group content, now is it?  And if they leave the named mobs as they are, they have to give Knights enough defensive to tank them well enough to survive, which means they suddenly can survive against a whole list of other boss mobs.<br />
<br />
You'll think that's great.  But you wouldn't be the one standing around doing nothing but slightly better DPS than a Paladin if a Knight is raid MT.  You wouldn't be the one standing around with no heals, no stuns, no LoH, no DoTs, no fear, no harm touch, no feign death,  nothing but some offensive disciplines you can't really risk using for fear you'll pull aggro with no way to lose it.  And you wouldn't be the one watching Knights get improvements on their spells next expansion, even though they managed to gank a big part of your class individuality, while you get the big zippo, nada, nothing but some more AAs just like everyone else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">Arbosch,<br />
<br />
We ALL know how it is really to some extent. There's a Warrior MA. If your raid force is particularly powerful, you plow through the trash. Otherwise the pullers try to bring in mobs one or two at a time, but they do get impatient. The Enchanters can handle just about all the extras. There is little add-tanking in the open zones and even less in the instanced raids.<br />
<br />
The 5-9 Warriors present are pretty much capable of handling red mob fights on the way to the last battle, re-spawned yardtrash, red-splits, and red deaths adds. The actual &quot;Tanking&quot; role for Knights is much like it is in PoTime, but even more limited since some of the &quot;non-boss&quot; mobs can actually wipe a raid if a real 100% Tank doesn't get on them and there aren't any (or nearly any) boss mobs like CT and Inny especially designed for Knights to MT.<br />
<br />
Having seen your Magelo, as a RL I frankly wouldn't ask you to MT CT or Inny in PoTime. Maybe you can claim high level Paladins (which you aren't) face unfair difficulties that they shouldn't. I claim that they ALWAYS (at least since Kunark) have tanked some raid mobs without Defensive and done so often by the skin of their teeth, grit, and a little extra attention from the support classes.<br />
<br />
The responce to the GoD issues by some Knights is a CLEAR effort to try to get SoE to make undergeared/incapable Knights into Warriors with Spellbooks - that is why there is soooo much outcry against changing the content and making it appropriate. Truth be told (a rare occurance in this hyped up pseudo crisis - but this IS TSW and not PoN) Knights should be absolutely delighted by content changes. Done right plow tanking and add tanking will be Knight doable (at least by those Knights with Tank-like AC and HP's) and Warriors will be able to focus as always on the hardest mobs to be encountered in the raid.<br />

One would think this is an overly simplistic argument, paladins get some advantages warriors don't get, and warriors get some advantages paladins don't get. Paladins wouldn't be the first class that has found their class description somewhat changed by an expansion in general, so instead of constantly attempting to discover this mythical parity that everybody seems to excited to define, why not instead focus their efforts on new ways that they can actively contribute to group settings...<br />

Ah and again it's cool to say again and again that named are immune to stun but you STILL can mitigate damage by healing yourself, and no this is not as negligible as you would like us to believe, why shouldn't this be taken into account ?<br />
<br />
Tell you what. Have 7 knights chain heal your warrior the next time you tank a raid mob then come back and tell me if they can keep him alive. The capacity to heal for 850hps every 6secs when a mob is doing 4k+ damage more to a knight over a warrior (no defensive ability) PER melee round is meaningless. <br />
<br />
You need to compare paladin + spell to mitigate damage with warrior + disc, this is what I did, you can check the result, and it seems ok to me, doesn't they to you ?<br />
<br />
And you equated this to balancing out? You're pulling my leg right?<br />
<br />
Mob hits for 8k. Warrior mitigates HALF so receives 4k<br />
Mob hits for 8k. Knight mitigates 0 so receives 8k then heals for 850hp <br />
<br />
A difference of 7150hp more dmg taken by a knight on one round<br />
<br />
How the hell are you coming to any logical conclusion that 1 even REMOTELY resembles the other.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Selaradrid:<br />
<br />
Taragar. noone is saying that ALL paladin abilities benefit thier tank role. so NO your ability to rez does not help you tank anything. but neither does my ability to bind wounds.<br />
<br />
It was a joke, why do you think the little smily face was there.<br />
<br />
It's also why I put the 2 sentences below this that we were discussing the spellbook vs content that hits like reparn and not trash.<br />
<br />
<br />
Lokkak:<br />
<br />
Yeah, your plan is to keep screaming until they give you (the kid in the candy store) what you want? Eh?<br />
<br />
Yup, until balance is restrored and knights have a valid group/raid role again the bitching will continue. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thorvak:<br />

I have a 65 paladin. If you are saying your fast cast heals are restricted so that you cannot use them in battle, you are obviously not that skilled. I did not find trouble using TAB then heal hotkey after a round of hits. When a cheal is going to land on my warrior a little late, sometimes i wish i still had that ability to TAB and heal myself. Saying its a secondary purpose i would agree, you are more geared to be a tank then a cleric. Saying that it cant be used in battle, well id say you need to gain skill in your class. Dont even start the arguement of &quot;omgz i cant hold aggro if I heal myself!1111!one!&quot; because i know better <br />
<br />
I never implied that I couldn't use them while tanking. I said that the harder the mob the less % of success the cast will have (more interrupts) and added to that factor is the very small heal value of that heal vs the damage output of said mob.<br />
<br />
<br />
I would go as far as to say stun is a mitigation ability. I know i know it doesnt work on boss mobs because it would trvialize them - thats not a problem other then when they make those boss mobs hit too hard and one groupable. realize that.<br />
<br />
Agreed. But also realize that more and more non boss mobs now hit like previous expansion boss mobs which are now stun immune. So a trash mob that's stun immune that outputs 4k dmg per melee round (avg 1k hit) that can't be stunned is as deadly, Also note that apart from full raid mobs there has never been 1 groupable named mobs where an appropriately geared warrior HAD to use defensive. <br />
<br />
<br />
If knights are supposed to be 75% warrior - if a fully equipped time warrior is stretching his limits to tank something, then a paladin shoudlnt be able to tank it by 25% right?<br />
<br />
If it's restricted to 1 group I disagree. No 1 group restricted content should ever be created where a warrior is the only possible choice. <br />
<br />
If it's a raid mob then I agree if a warrior has a 50% chance of survival on it a knight should have 0 chance on it. BUT, that doesn't mean a knight shouldn't have a chance of surviving 1 melee round, it means a knight should never be able to survive tanking the encounter from start to finish.<br />
<br />
With mobs tuned to 45% defensive + 5% inate dmg mitigation and knights having 0% mitigation it means any encounter that is made where a warrior cannot tank it without defensive a knight will splat in seconds. <br />
<br />
IMO full raid mobs should require a warrior to be under defensive or die. PERIOD. This would lead to guilds HAVING to set up MT/ST/TT chains to constantly have a warrior with defensive tank the mob. If you gave knights a partial mitigation ability SoE could then tune the raid encounters where add/splits would require the ability to be utilised which would mean that warriors could also tank them but they would be required for the main mob so knights would have a place, it would also increase the gap between knights and everyone else. <br />
<br />
Warriors have to stop looking at knights receiving a mitgation ability as taking over their roles. In effect it could open up so many other content venues for SoE rather than restricting themselves the way they are now. Would knights receving a mitigation ability mean that they could more reliably tank older content? Yes it would. But that means little to nothing except in the sense of a kngiht 1 grouping RC in UP. Again, with raids taking hours to do a guild will never in its right mind replace a warrior with a knight if they have enough warriors present. <br />
<br />
Then theres the knights tanking 99% of the game. That's so disingenuous it's not even funny. A PoTime geared knight can tank 99% true, but why the hell would that knight be in a guild at ToV level? Or VT level? Can a knight that is in full ornate/ldon gear tank 99% of the game? Of course not. and they shouldn't be able to. Would they be able with 25% mitigation? No. The impact of a mitigation ability on the game from the high end means SoE tunes encounters to both classes. Bosses on warrior abilities, splits/adds on knight abilities. This gives warriors their main role of MT and kngihts their main role of MA. This also means that warriors can still MA better than knights but they're better serving their guilds in their true roles.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u84"><b>Kamce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p84">No 1 group restricted content should ever be created where a warrior is the only possible choice. <br />
<br />
I agree completely with this statement.  Solutuion - tune the 1 group restricted content.<br />
<br />
The developers failed in the design of content for GoD.  They did not design around the abilities of the classes as they exist for Time equiped players.  Instead, it appears they only designed content around a warrior's ability to mitigate damage through defensive.  This was the wrong approach and resulted in defensive being required.  If the content had been developed such that defensive or even evasive were not essential to the success of single group content, but would still provide the same difficulty level, we would never have heard a peep from the Paladins.<br />
<br />
Correcting design flaws in a new expansion should not be solved by bringing a class up in ability to meet the content.  The changes should be made to the content to bring it in balance with the existing state of time equiped characters.<br />
<br />
Ofcourse, this does assume that we all agree that the classes were balanced at the time equiped level pre-GoD.</div></div><hr />

Check my post about this to see numbers, this is balanced up to mobs that are dishing 1000 dps, under paladin are better than war, above war are better, it happens that ikkinz single group named are this limit ie roughly 1000 dps.<br />

<br />
<br />
It's because you are supposed to have better gear than in previous expansion, before GoD there was not a single mob (ok Velious AoW) that required defensive, up to PoTime. Knight can still tank the trash of the most difficult zone in the game : Uqua.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If it's restricted to 1 group I disagree. No 1 group restricted content should ever be created where a warrior is the only possible choice. <br />

<br />
Yeah. Countless paladin tanked Vxed / Tipt, Several paladin tanked Ikkinz. Warrior is not the only choice, it's just the best choice, and they are supposed to be the best tank in the game, sounds fair no ?<br />

It'll create far more balance problems than it supposedly would have solved.<br />

But you see, the paladins don't agree.  They're still mad that warriors got some upgrades and they didn't, so we get these stupid demands for knight upgrades now in response to the difficult GoD content (that knights have already tanked successfully, albeit not often, even though it's cutting edge content that WILL get easier as guilds progress and gear improves).  Of course it makes sense that if the problem is caused by a few encounters in GoD, you consider tuning those encounters.  You do not change the entire game.  Duh.  That's obvious.  They insist on an upgrade because warriors got upgrades previously.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well hello Mr. Knight, let me clue you into a couple of very simple concepts.  Aggro generation was never a &quot;Knight only special abiity,&quot; regardless of your claims to the contrary.  It was something that every class in the game generated with ease.  And Warriors were the only real exception to that.  Defensive is a completely different topic than aggro generation.  Defensive is not something every class gets, regardless of Knight attempts to try and claim that riposte or parry disciplines are &quot;defensive like&quot; in an attempt to justify their getting it.  Warriors have a riposte discipline and it ain't defensive.<br />

For one you just showed how you dont understand how defensive works and helps to mitigate damage.<br />
<br />
Also, even if it worked like that, 7150 - 4000 = 3150<br />
<br />
How the hell are you coming to any logical conclusion based on &quot;Paladin math&quot;? Oh thats right, your conclusion is not logical, my bad.<br />
<br />
You are still preaching the same moot point - Paladins should be able to tank one group content.  Seems like the general consensus agrees with you.  On that note i have seen no &quot;logical conclusion&quot; that has led me to believe paladins need defensive.<br />
<br />
Paladins do not need defensive to tank in PoP, hard LDoN, LoY, Luclin, Kunark, original everquest. GoD content is being looked into, so soon paladins wont need defensive to tank one group GoD content. If you think the only way to fix the few one group encounters in GoD is to give paladins a scaled down form of defensive i would say wait for the content to be changed before you come to this conclusion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u93"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p93">Taragor, the reason they're capping on you about your math on defensive is because, as has been mentioned a number of times by many people, defensive doesn't straight out cut damage in half.  A more realistic, but made up example, of that 8k in damage you're talking about would be 3k in DB damage and 5k in DI damage.  The DB damage would only be impacted by shielding, but not at all by defensive.  While the DI damage would be reduced by 45% when defensive was used.  So that 8k would be more like 5250 damage on the Warrior instead of the 4k you claim.<br />
<br />
Still a reduction of 2750 damage is a significant reduction, I admit.  And it's meant to be that way.</div></div><hr />
