Riposte Parse<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Same as above, only attacked the NPC from the front.<br />
<br />
Note: from my observations, not all ripostes are indicated with &quot;You try and hit soandso, but soandso ripostes!&quot;  So I included every hit against me, along with riposte messages.  This NPC does not attack back other than ripostes.  I have noticed the same thing on mobs that do attack back, so I do not believe it to be unique to this NPC.  The extra hits appear to scale with the hits that are marked regardless.<br />
<br />
Darkblade + Augmented BoC<br />
-------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Slashes:  50,796;  34,522 hits (69%) +  16,274 misses<br />

<br />
<br />
As you can see, dual wielding with a darkblade and a 20 delay weapon resulted in roughly twice as many ripostes compared to wielding a BoW.<br />
<br />
<br />
Strikethrough Parse<br />
==============<br />
<br />
Look above for the 5% strikethrough parse to compare.  Note that the 5% parse had 10 combat effects.  This one was with 25.<br />
<br />
Darkblade w/ anger 3 + BoC w/ Ykesha augment, 25 combat effects, 10% strikethrough<br />

The thing that's standing out to me is huge difference in the amount of pure hate. Just looking at main hand procs and then dual wield compared to using a two hander.<br />
<br />
Darkblade Procs - 1,313 * 650 = 853,450 Pure Hate<br />
BoW Procs          -   996 * 700 = 697,200 Pure Hate<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kilaara</div><div class="date">10-02-2003, 11:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Jateki the numbers are nice but the mobs ist not interested in numbers.<br />
<br />
So you grab aggro fast or not .. thats the real question in exp groups .<br />
<br />
So you grab aggro and hold it thats the question on raids.<br />
<br />
And when the Darkblade isnt real better at both parts it isnt better than a BoW.<br />
<br />
When I use my DW combo BBotE and Hategiver I put the BBotE in Main hand cause it procs like mad. Maybe over all the 700 hate from the HG is more than the 95 dd/Stun of the BBothE but the BBotE will give me more and therefore also earlier procs with better aggro in the beginning.<br />
<br />
When you have the aggro it may be nice to have some more aggro but when you do not loose it with a BoW the more aggro of a Darkblade is something for statistics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Torrin</div><div class="date">10-02-2003, 11:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes both parses are 8 hours in length to the second.<br />
<br />
About flurries:  Flurries are procs as far as the game is concerned.  Procs not from the weapon only come from the primary hand. (i.e. pestilence shock)  1h weapons have a lower proc rate than 2h, hence the fewer flurries dual wielding.  Flurries are also affected by the combat effects time mod.<br />
<br />
As for the difference in aggro between my BoW and Darkblade setup: It isn't as big as you think for a few reasons.<br />
<br />
First off, the dps aggro dual wielding just seems less than 2h.  The damage may be the same, but 2h wielders constantly aggro over me until I proc.  This will be mitigated or eliminated when I get a time weapon off-hand though.  (hopefully eliminated)<br />
<br />
Second, Force of Ykesha procs twice as often from my BoW compared to my off-hand BoC.  I havn't tested the proc rate of pestilence shock with my dual wield setup, but it should also be lower dual wielding.<br />
<br />
Third, Anger does not seem much more (if any more) aggro than EB.  Last night doing missions, one early proc of Anger did not aggro off the mobs the shaman just slowed.<br />
<br />
So far my opinion of the Darkblade is that it is better aggro in the long run, but less aggro in the short term.  Frankly, I'm not sure its worth it over an augmented Blade of War without type 8 augments.  If Sony does not put in type 8 proc augments, I will proc Anger in RL.<br />
<br />
On a side note, be careful buying multiple proc augments.  I had a nasty surprise last night trying to loot my corpse-- I couldn't pick up the bag containing my Blade of War.  The augments are lore, but the game will still let you buy and apply multiples.  Now I get to make a corpse every week to hold it.  Sure makes comparing weapon setups difficult.  Thanks Sony.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And because I was curious I did my own parse against Bella Helsin banker in Katta.<br />
<br />
Parse was 418 minutes.  Atk 1427.  Str 305.  dex 295.  AA all offensive except only crit 3 no Ingenuity.  Haste Flowing Moss Mantle (41% I believe)<br />

Edit: fixed dex and added line for Ykesha dps</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jateki</div><div class="date">10-02-2003, 12:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I posted on a similar thread listing my two set ups. I'll post them again here for reference. I now have all my offensive AA maxed. I get a hell of a lot of procs with both. More with dual wield though.<br />
<br />
<br />
Vanazir, Dreamer's Despair - 100dd/27AC debuff <br />
DMG: 60 DLY: 38 DPS: 31.84 <br />
Symbol of the Planemasters - 75dd/Stun 0.0 Sec/65<br />
<br />
Darkblade of the Warlord - 100dd/Stun 0.0 Sec/65 and 650 Hate<br />
DMG: 38 DLY: 35 DPS: 22 <br />
Symbol of the Planemasters - 75dd/Stun 0.0 Sec/65<br />
The Rotting Fist - 40dd/24 per tick dot <br />
DMG: 16 DLY: 20 DPS: 16.5 Magic DMG Disease: 1 <br />
And I add the following augment:<br />
Silver-Flecked Crystal of Agony - Rujarkian Bile - 125dd<br />
<br />
I don't any aggro problems with either of these. I'm not having any trouble with initial aggro at all, and I don't have trouble with long term aggro either. It's just not happening, I don't know how else to say it. <br />
<br />
In xp situations I'm able to aggro the mob off the puller on the incoming without any trouble. I'm not even shooting any arrows at it to peel. As soon as it's in range, it's on me. We have a few mobs mezzed in camp and I break the mez and gain aggro without any trouble. In situations where a mob is being offtanked, I'm able to gain aggro with a couple of taunts. If a early slow or tash pull aggro, I get it right back.<br />
<br />
In raid situations I'm able to gain aggro initially or on a tank switch with an area taunt. I don't lose aggro until the mob is dead, I'm dead or the next tank comes in and hits area taunt. I'm not losing aggro once I have it either. In fact when someone does manage to over nuke like say on a tier 1 trial, the mob summons their ass and beats them down and everyone laughs. <br />
<br />
I'm not trying to say one is better than the other in any way. I'm saying I'm not having any trouble myself. To me it was always more of a question of whether or not I would be able to survive the increased riposte damage from dual wielding and I think I can. Right now I'm using the Vanazir for dps and the Darkblade for aggro. I'm usually averaging +150ish dps with the Vanazir and about 140ish with the Darkblade combo. The more I use the Darkblade, the more I like it. The other warrior on Lany's with Darkblade uses a Bloodfrenzy with it. Damn, that one hell of a combo no matter how you look at it.<br />
<br />
Different strokes for different folks. There’s more than one way to skin a cat. I just wanted to post my experience with these two fine weapons.<br />
<br />
Peace-</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Torrin</div><div class="date">10-02-2003, 12:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Vanazir aggro is poor in my opinion.<br />
<br />
My post was comparing an augmented BoW to my Darkblade setup.  Augmented BoW &gt;&gt;&gt; Vanazir.<br />
<br />
I have some aggro issues before the first anger proc.  Had a shaman and a wizard die from the boss in a normal LDoN mission last night before I got a proc off, which is unheard of in my nearly 100 missions when I was using a BoW.  This is with a Raex BP, too.  (of course I didn't shield the wizard or area taunt to be evil)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">10-02-2003, 01:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The thing I found interesting about this was the DPS.  Even with a crap offhand (by time standards), the Darkblade equals the BoW.  Put an EoE, Hammer of Crushing Waves, or Sword of Primordial Power in the offhand and it would easily surpass the BoW in DPS.  <br />
<br />
I thought the reason that everybody talked down the Darkblade was because it's DPS was too low for initial aggro.  This is obviously not true. <br />
<br />
And if your wizard and shaman die on a normal assassination boss while you're using a DBotW and Raex bp then all three of you and your healer must have been afk.  For chrissakes, I have done normal LDoN assassinations using WMBS (exp group dropppable weapon, no proc) and never had anyone die because I couldn't get aggro.  Seriously, that makes me question everything you have said.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Splaktar</div><div class="date">10-02-2003, 01:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Vanazir aggro is poor?<br />
<br />
Odd our war who has it can't use it for DPS because it overaggros too much.<br />
<br />
Our SK/Pal who have it over aggro all the time, and often end up dead.<br />
<br />
Our other wars use EoE/ED, BoW, Augmented BoW, ED/EoE, and EoE/SoPP.  No DBotW now in like 8 kills. <br />
<br />
We also just got our first Raex BP, and our war with it has been over aggro'ing a lot lately too :P  With EoE/SoPP or EoE/AoE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trolkin</div><div class="date">10-02-2003, 02:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I love vdd, i have 0 trouble gaining, and holding aggro. The dps aggro alone on it is pretty crazy, i find unless another warrior procs there 1handers alot(most the warriors in my guild all have EOE, they drop like water+ed's and so on), i easily hold aggro over any of them if they don't proc alot. VDD still has a solid proc, im not sure exactly how much aggro it is, but it seems to be a good bit, id say around half a rage proc. As i said i love vdd, it gets good aggro, ESP at first, i always seem to hold aggro even threw enrage, never lossing it, low riposte's, great dps, good stats for a 2h.. i can't see myself trading it in for darkblade, and def not for bow, esp after aug type 8's come out. Just thought id post to defend vdd hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Torrin</div><div class="date">10-02-2003, 02:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Before I got a BP or darkblade or Ykesha augment, I was aggroing off the Vanazir wielding MT using my BoW nearly every single time.  After my augment, my BoW became COMPLETELY unusable if I was not MTing.  I'd wield a plankton until 60%, switch to BoW, and aggro after 10 seconds.<br />
<br />
Let me put it this way: with an augmented BoW, tanking Tallon, with no bard, eating at least 3 disease barbs (60% less aggro), my wizards were able to go OOM in a 4 minute tallon kill.  This did not happen with a Vanazir wielding MT.  Wizards said it was like night and day.<br />
<br />
Vanazir is better aggro until the first proc.  Then its not.<br />
<br />
Darkblade is better dps than a BoW, yes.  However like I said, dual wield dps aggro just seems less.  The proc rate on a darkblade is great though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trolkin</div><div class="date">10-02-2003, 02:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well i don't agree with what you say at all about VDD aggro.. both hean and another warrior in my guild use bow's for DPS.. and never pull off me when im tanking, let alone my wizards blow tz up in time without any problems.<br />
<br />
    But i do agree about 2h dps seem's to generate far more aggro then duelwield dps, and i am also unsure why that is*which is another reason my vdd seem's to build huge aggro, after a couple minutes of fighting, the mob is solidly on me, no turning on anyone, till another warrior ae taunts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Does your warrior MT with his VDD have all the same AAs and such as you?  Just making sure you weren't pulling aggro because you have more atk, more offensive AAs, and combat effects mod, etc and he doesn't....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Furor</div><div class="date">10-02-2003, 03:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You should use a different type of weapon in offhand (Blunt/Pierce) so you can distinguish precisely between the two.<br />
<br />
And yes, a DBoTW and EoE puts out about 30 more DPS than a BoW IIRC. I'll have to check my own parses to be certain.<br />
<br />
Of course it's a DW combo and therefore can be quite lethal when MTing due to induced spikes.<br />
<br />
In short, it needs to be made a 2hander, Rallos Axe model with a ratio along the lines of 50/28 or 52/30 at the worst.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Splaktar</div><div class="date">10-02-2003, 03:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, I agree there.  I've been wondering why there's not a better 2h'er for MT'ing in Time.  It just doesn't make sense to me.  VDD seems reasonable, but it seems like there should be something specifically for Wars, that is a little better than VDD.<br />
<br />
I guess SoE just decided that we all must use DBotW + RZ shield and never should use 2h or dual wield again... which about 99% of warriors hate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jateki</div><div class="date">10-02-2003, 06:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Jateki the numbers are nice but the mobs ist not interested in numbers.<br />
I missed this earlier, sorry. I'll respond now. The mobs most certainly care about numbers. The entire game of Everquest is built around numbers. I assumed everyone realized this. If you ever doubt the power of pure hate spells in EQ, find yourself a SK and have him chain cast Terror of Thule on a mob that you tanked with your best weapons for 50%. When you get done with that, have a Pally pull aggro off you in the same situation. It's amazing how much zero damage aggro these two classes can create.<br />
<br />
I like Furor's idea as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">10-02-2003, 07:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">VDD has better ratio than just about any other weapon in the game right now so of course it has better aggro based on its DPS.  The proc is definitely less than an Enraging Blow so over the long run you end up with less aggro since the procs on EB/Anger eventually catch up, but VDD is great for initial aggro since it is not as dependent on getting procs to establish aggro.  You can hold aggro with VDD, but it'd require other people watch their aggro, especially other warriors.</div></div><hr />

You are neglecting DPS aggro, and are assuming the fact that the stun portion of the Anger proc &quot;stacks&quot; with the hate from the +hate component.  From my experience, 1 anger does not equal 1 Ykesha + 1 EB.  I'm beginning to wonder if anger is merely 650 hate.  (would love to see a dev answer this one.  its really hard to tell)<br />
<br />
With a good offhand, the two combined will be more hate over time though.  Whether its worth spending the DKP on two time weapons and eating the extra ripostes is debatable.  Until type 8 weapon augments are found, my opinion will be &quot;no.&quot;  Augmented BoWs are just incredible.  Especialy since they are so easily obtained.</div></div><hr />

Only a conjoncture, but we know that individual effect can have any hate the dev want (that it's not related to the actual dmg, but a fixed amount for resist, crit, etc).<br />
<br />
I'm not sure about the anger proc, maybe the stun do add something.  But if it was really a full stun + 650 hate, the aggro would be insane.  I mean in the range that you proc, it's on you no matter what (like a slow).  We know it's not the case, a anger proc does not necessarily mean aggro if other tanks are using other aggro method.<br />

I.e. since the weapon, not the proc, has the modifier (BF vs. BoC base proc rates), does the enhanced proc rate of the weapon affect the proc rate for auguments ON that weapon?  (also need to test for buff-type procs like call of sky, etc...).<br />

 There's a monk one too but I don't feel like digging it up. Anyways proc order is checked this way. Innate &gt; Augment &gt; Buff<br />

 Absor even confirmed innates get 1st check and rest are ignored if they proc.<br />
=================================<br />
<br />
 Aside from all that, the thing that jumped out at me originally was the DB proc rate, definately appears to be tweaked up like Bloodfrenzy(Little lower, .3 less PPM). So that's nice at least, not just the usual ~2 per minute.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The ranger parses were WAY too short to prove anything more than augments may only reduce primary procs by a small amount, if at all.  The SK did no tests with isolated procs.  Although his results did suggest Absor is correct, its not real proof.<br />
<br />
I will yield and say my conclusion was the result of 40 hours of parsing not being adequate enough to evade the gayness of EQ's RNG.  This is good news, I'd rather not lose any EB procs for Ykeshas.</div></div><hr />

I'm a bit surprised at the results thought.<br />
<br />
But I guess it even out with the 20 dly off-hander.  The dark blade alone should take less riposte then bow, but add a fast off-hander and you can get the results you have now.   <br />
<br />
Also the reason you don't always get the &quot;riposte&quot; message is probably because of tactical mastery, you hit throught the riposte but don't see the message.<br />

It's not hard to tell at all, just read the SPDat file.  It's not the devs telling us it has a stun, it's the spdat, and the spdat don't lie.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1152 ripostes with DBotW/BoC<br />
<br />
and<br />
<br />
585 ripostes with BoW.<br />
<br />
It still comes out to be about 2x as many ripostes though.  567 more ripostes with 1h.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thorbadin</div><div class="date">10-06-2003, 06:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm maybe.  It's been a while since I've paid attention to that.<br />
<br />
The hate value of a spell is case by case, and as far as we know, there is no way of finding the real value except in the case of  simple straight hate effects that tell us it adds 650 hate.  It's most probably server side if not someone would have hacked it by now.<br />
<br />
Manaburn, lifeburn and stuff like that do an absurb amount of dmg for 0 aggro or so.  On the opposite, strike of solusek do a very high amount, even for the dmg done.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, so aggro is a case by case basis and not something you can find in the spelldat.  (I really doubt that it's &quot;effect&quot; based if not bash and stun kick would be uber aggro (maybe it should) but it's not).<br />
<br />
It's very possible that anger is 650 aggro only.  It's also possible that it's 650 + stun aggro + dd aggro or something in between.  In that case, with a like 2.6 or so proc per minute, that weapon should be godly aggro.  I mean, if it was straight aggro from those 3 effects, an augmented blade of war proc would do like 30% less hate from proc then the Dark Blade only, and you have the possiblity of an augmented bloodfrenzy for off-hand too.  This would be the best aggro combo by far, far, but that's not what we seem to see.<br />
<br />
My take is dark blade aggro is pretty good.  Main reason for that is the 2.6 or so proc rate min, which is nearly double what normal 1-hander seem to have and more then standard 2-handers (like BoW).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KhalimBloodhelm</div><div class="date">10-11-2003, 01:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, Now we have the important Question!!  Type 8 Augments have been found, all the same as type 4 augments. Same prices I beleive also.  Here's my question to all of you.<br />
<br />
What would be better Aggro:<br />
<br />
BoW augmented with Anger 3 (600 Hate)<br />
<br />
DBotW w/Anger 3 + EoE (or other similar proc/ratio weap) w/ Anger 3<br />
<br />
Vanazir w/Anger 3<br />
<br />
Now a seperate question:  Which of those would be the better TANKING weapon.  In terms of benefiting the whole raid?  Taking into account especially ripostes.  I'm also curious, since ripostes are so much more with 1 1h weapons, how much more parries do you have?  Maybe the increased number of parries (reducing total damage taken) would balance out the increased number of ripostes?<br />
<br />
Also curiuos what the mob you were testing on hits for max and min, so like, how many ripostes would that translate to in a 3-5 minute Time fight, and how much more dmg for that 3-5 minute Time fight, with mobs hitting from 1-3k in dmg. <br />
<br />
I ask because my guild is at this point entering Phase 5 of Time.  We have about a bit more than half our warriors without BoW (most using either BoC and BF or BoC and GBoS or something else)  Last night first warrior got Vanazir. There are at least 2 guilds behind us (lower elemental level) competing heavily for BoW's from RZtW, and the chance of us being able to get those for our warriors any time in the near future is very small, considering our priorities now lie in Time and upper elemental mobs. So I'm wondering if its going to be better using Vanazir, holding out for BoW, or using something like EoE and DBoTW.  <br />
<br />
Also take into account that I am not MT a whole ton, so mostly TMing, offtank, backup, or just DPS.  Thanks for the info in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unless they upgrade the Darkblade, it will remain in my backpack forever.<br />
<br />
A Darkblade + EoE and two Anger 3s might do a little more aggro over long periods of time, but in the short term, 2h dominates.  Dual wield with any setup is not worth it currently, IMO.  I hate it, but I'm not going to wield an inferior weapon just because its our &quot;uber time weapon.&quot;<br />
<br />
It needs to be made a 2h, BADLY.<br />
<br />
As for my riposte parses, the only way I could get an 8 hour parse was to attack a green mob.  I merely intended to show the rate of ripostes, not damage.  Just remember darkblade + EoE is double the ripostes of a BoW and use some judgement to estimate with different weapons.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am also convinced more than ever that melee aggro is much more valuable than proc aggro, especialy since esentialy any weapon can now get EB.  Right now, Vanazir has the highest melee aggro for warriors.<br />
<br />
When you taunt a mob, until your next proc, the only thing that carries you is melee aggro.  You can use a vanazir and aggro more immediately, or dual wield, aggro less, and get your next proc in average of 13 seconds instead of 15.  I'll take the 2h.</div></div><hr />

5 hours, 14 minutes.<br />
<br />
Unbuffed, VDD + 100 Ykesha Aug, 1389 ATK, 267 Dex, 285 Str.  Not many offensive AAs: PB1, CF1, Ing1.<br />
<br />

Crit DPS: 7.0<br />
Critical blasts: 14<br />
Critical blasts Per Min: 0.45<br />
<br />
It does appear that your Combat Effects makes a signifigant increase in Procs.  <br />
<br />
It also shows that Hean's AAs, plus 40 extra ATK, put him just 2 DPS over me, even though VDD has a better ratio (by 0.07) and 3 extra damage bonus.  But seeing that the ratio isn't all that much better, and that's about 50+ AAs... it seems like his DPS should be higher...<br />
<br />
Torrin got about 10 DPS higher with his BoW, than I did with VDD.  But again most of that can be attributed to him having 100 ATK more than me.  Thus apparently 50+ AA points in offensives = approx 0.07 gain in 2h ratio + the higher damage bonus from going from 32 (37 damage bonus) to 38 delay (40 damage bonus).<br />
<br />
Also of note is that I think both Hean and Torrin were using the 125 Ykesha, and me the 100.  Though this is mostly a negligible difference.<br />
<br />
One thing for sure that is obvious though, is that the unbuffed DPS would be much lower on another 'exp' level NPC.  You'll never get a 70%+ hit% on exp mobs and not all exp mobs will give you zero resists on procs.  Still a good target for testing AAs and different weapon combos.<br />
<br />
My other post shows that I got about a 8 DPS increase from the recent Time upgrade where I gained 80 ATK.  And in many past parses it's generally seen that for warriors you gain approx 10 DPS for 100 ATK from Avatar.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why?<br />
<br />
anger3 Darkblade + ykesha BoC &amp; 25 combat effects (8 hours)<br />
=====================================<br />
<br />
&quot;face contorts with anger&quot;:  1509 (3.144)<br />
&quot;You unleash a flurry of attacks.&quot;:  382 <br />
&quot;face contorts with rage&quot;:  1566 (3.263)<br />

<br />
7.553 procs per minute.<br />
<br />
Add pestilence shock, and you have well over 9 procs per minute.<br />
<br />
My primary complaint with the darkblade was the gaps between procs not being sufficient aggro, especialy starting fights.  The new augs plus laying on combat effects reduces this problem significantly.<br />
<br />
Augments give a dual wield setup ~3 more ppm, and ~2 ppm for 2h.  The darkblade's Anger proc is about .75 more ppm than a BoW's EB, or a Vanazir's nightmare.  On top of that, combat effects has 5 procs to work on in a dual wield setup, as opposed to 3 procs to work on using a 2h.<br />
<br />
Without augments or combat effects, I would stick to 2h.  However augments and combat effects work more with dual wield  enough to make the darkblade better IMO.  I will still use my BoW on Quarm and Vallon though, because of ripostes.</div></div><hr />

So what you are saying is Darkblade needs an Augment, a decent offhander, an augmented offhander and some Time skill bonus items to get better than Blade of War... think SoE needs to read this and review that Time drop... ;)</div></div><hr />

the increase overall DPS taken due to ripostes).<br />
<br />
Is the extra agro (which should be insane with 1 EB/Stun per 7 seconds)<br />
Worth the Extra Ripostes ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Torrin</div><div class="date">10-17-2003, 09:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well personaly, I am obsessed with having the highest amount of aggro possible.  Probably because I box a wizard :D <br />
<br />
But I could see a lot of warriors choosing not to dual wield for the ripostes.  An anger 3 BoW and Vanazir holds aggro very well.  Certainly, you would need a good offhand to make it worth the switch IMO.  Also, if Sony ends up giving warriors some sort of skill based hate generation, less riposte weapons suddenly become much more attractve.<br />
<br />
However last night I tanked the Arbitor.  I got a few anger procs early in, so I decided to chain nuke on my wizard. (who has no pants)  I was able to chain SoS without dying, although I had no cleric spell haste.  Now if only Saryrn would drop an EoE for me...</div></div><hr />

DB+EoE+ Dual Anger + SoPM = 2 + 2+ 3 + 3 =10ppm ...<br />
Thats like 1 EB/Stun per 6 seconds<br />
<br />
BoW+ Anger + SoPM = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 ppm<br />
Thats like 1 EB/Stun per 10 seconds<br />
<br />
50% increase in proc rate ... Amazing<br />
But 50 to 100% more ripostes ...  Thats the DPS spike tradeoff.<br />
<br />
Increasing Combat Effects should even widen the Agro gap<br />
in favor of the Dual Wield combo.<br />
<br />
I think i'll stick with 2H &amp; Combat effects. <br />
I do not think such godly amount of agro is required.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Incorrect.  If anything, its slightly less than 2 ppm.<br />
<br />
Also, the Darkblade's Anger proc rate is about 2.75ish with 10 combat effects.<br />
<br />
With 25 combat effects and 2 augments, you can expect around 9.5 or slightly less ppm dual wielding with a darkblade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Torrin</div><div class="date">10-21-2003, 09:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Added some strikethrough parses.  Picked up some phase 2 gloves since they were &quot;free&quot; to me.<br />
<br />
It appears that CE might effect the strikethrough mod...<br />
<br />
Also given the small difference in riposte damage I took from the two dual wield parses, I think its safe to assume that dual wield results in not just 40%, but closer to 50% more ripostes.</div></div><hr />
