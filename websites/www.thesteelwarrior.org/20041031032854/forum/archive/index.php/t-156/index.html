<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1. pray you dont get the knock back version<br />
2. bring lots of ppl and kill really fast<br />
3. group heal and riposte disc<br />
<br />
early death is usually the result of a spiderling slipping in and 4k aeing the room.<br />
<br />
probably hardest encounter for the ease of getting to it. should definately have killed AD and grummus before this. easily one of the most blown events, the 3 day respawn is rediculous.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Mgb heals can be your friend.<br />
Control those spiders.<br />
Keep casters out of the room until after the first ae silence.<br />
Control those spiders.<br />
Put out as much dps as possible as quickly as possible, dont be afraid to go offensive early if you have to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wolveren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I hate this fight, especially since those spiders still keep coming once MB is dead. /bleargh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wudgurorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Tried for the First time Last Friday, and woot was the Knock back version.  Really Looking forward to having another shot at this guy. (failed at 20%)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yeah, dont let your victory celebration get in the way of the spider killing. Those little buggers will still blow for 4k after the Behemoth is dead, do loot fast and get a monk or someone to pull the gnome out into the hallway.<br />
<br />
For all the thinking and suprises that SoE put into some encounters to make them interesting, this one boils down to an all out dps zergfest.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">oh yeah; and control the spiders..<br />
<br />
that fight is downright annoyingly hilarious...reminds me of kedge &quot;hmm let's mistarget a seahorse and hit one of them fish&quot; BOOM &quot;wtf why are half of ya dead?&quot;  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Wudgurorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">How do you guys deal with the GFlux, We are toying with the Idea of Trying Bestow Divine Aura, and pull agro with AT, until the AE Fires off, and then going Repoist, and call asisst.<br />
<br />
Or Send in a Ranger or Paladin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Taelen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">What everyone has said is mostly accurate, just keep the spiders busy, take him down as fast as you can.  Keep him from ping-ponging or you die.  Slap a lev/dmf on melee to counter the g-flux effect. Leave the room once he drops, award loot, AE TL out. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">you're getting warmer wudgurorm...i don't want to delve too far into it but your logic is right :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>mightyberge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">well, first thing is you got to keep the spiders out of the room or they explode for a 4k ae unrisistable. he also has a 100 ft radious(smaller then room) 600 ae knockback and at times a 2k dd one person beam. the best option is leave four group outside the rooms. 2 on  each end on  oppsoite ends of the  halls to hold spiders back. <br />
as for tanking it, call assist immediatly if MA and go full blown offense(except the MA) manavurn/trueshot/lifeburn the sec assist is called. and others just nuke like  crazy. melees disc at 50%</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">takes too many resources to keep 4 groups clearing at each corner. if you are short enchanters, /w all 64-65 enchanter and see who is willing to help in exchange for getting flagged. 1-2 enchanters in each corner is all you need after MB becomes active.<br />
<br />
if you are short ppl, ally with another guild and get it done(remember there are only 72 flags tho), there is some strategy but its primarily a numbers game, you got as much time to kill him as your clerics can cast  their lvl 63 group heal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Trot02</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">i think he also ae silences</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Roma</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">One enchanter in every corner worked for me :) Dazzle works on those puppies, so its a decent duration mez, just don't want to AE mez or they all break at once and keel u. Once Behemoth is dead you have to try to mem blur the spiders so they don't kill the enchanters, hehe, which likely isn't going to work :) Death by 7 or so annoying spiders is FUN!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">yeah id say just keep 1-2 enchanters at each corner. maybe with a necro to help pump em if possible or another rooter as back-up cover. have a last line of defence rooter/enchanter outside the door to the MB room to pick up any strays.<br />
<br />
once MB spawns, with his knockback etc it can be a bit chaotic and hard for the MA to keep control so really its an all out DPS fight to the end so don't hold back and you want to try and get him down in under a minute.<br />
<br />
when MB is down, make sure you check status with enchanters asap and send help to them if possible. last thing you want is for a stray to get into the room and nuke the whole raid to death.<br />
