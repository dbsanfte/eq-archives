<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Halivon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, you people been so helpfull to so many asking questions here that i decided to give it a shot.<br />
<br />
I am a 65 war, invested my AAs so far in defensive and thus my offensive kind needs some work (I am a slow grinder and raid most of my online time)<br />
<br />
I have a bag full of weapons that i mix and turn in hope to keep my agro (not going into know agro issues)<br />
<br />
On the 1H scenario (for agro)<br />
Typicaly I start a normal combat encounter with my red Epic in main hand and SoB in secundary, i remove my haste belt and hope for a epic proc in the first round of attacks or at the least a SoB proc (if i get one then i am set) otherwise i then switch secundary into the shield from BoT and bash, replace the secondary back and equip haste item on (this is like 3-5 sec into fight) <br />
Sometimes I use Braid of Golden Hair from Tunare that has a dot proc -  very unreliable to proc (but when it does it adds nice agro).<br />
Once this phase is over theres been some level of slowing or debuffing and i press my taunt key. In general i do get agro but spend most the combat trying to hold it.<br />
<br />
In times where my stats are not maxed and no FA shaman is present (and in long fights) I equip my primal hoping for a fast avatar but normally that will cause agro to become a lot more unstable.<br />
<br />
My questions are: <br />
1. Any major flaw on this? I had a couple, not many people finding all this work amusing, do i sux that much? And in that case what should I change? NOTE: I don't allways have as many trouble in groups as in raids, so maybe i have some ubber friends and it hurts me (mostly my pride) not to be up to their standards.<br />
2. Not many chances of getting a EB weapon soon and I hear so much about the split blade and such that got me wondering if it would be a good option to get that for main hand instead of epic. I may have a shot at Obsidian Scimitar of War from VZ?<br />
3. On a side note, anyone else feels that damage mitigation increases with the shield on?, or am I just experiencing the fact that the shield makes me go above 1600ac? is this a milestone? I experience this in bot groups. (tho people mock me again)<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any help.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>slyse</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">GBoS is the best aggro weapon you have listed there.  The obsidian scim procs quite often, but it's not really noticable aggro.  SBoD is beyond terrible for aggro purposes, and I've never had any experience with the tunare whip.<br />
<br />
I'd say go for GSoT/SotB for aggro with what you currently have/can get easily.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fenring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think you're trying to do too much, just put GBoS in mainhand and SoTB in offhand, taunt when debuffs land or when you lose aggro and don't worry about the rest.<br />
<br />
I recommend using LDoN to work on your AA, that way you can get anger augs to sove a lot of aggro issues.<br />
<br />
If you have fun switching all that stuff around during a fight that's one thing but I don't think it's really doing anything for your aggro, except switching in primal to get avatar which does give you more dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Removing your haste belt does nothing.  If you are going to get a proc in the first X seconds, you're going to get it with or without haste.<br />
<br />
Second, get a Copper Hammer of Striking, offhand it with the greatblade main and throw the rest of that shit away.  It's your best chance and it will be reliable aggro once procs start going off.  Before then, well, there just ain't much you can do about it.</div></div><hr />
