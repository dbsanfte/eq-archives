<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gishomil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've seen this item posted in Lucy, Magelo, and a few other low-key places, but not with the mainstream Allakhazam stuff. <br />
<br />
Leads me to believe this is some kind of rare cloak, even though it's droppable and rec. level of 53. I also have a weird hunch it could be Stormhammer only. Does anyone have the details on this cloak?<br />

Here's a link to it: Cloak of Gallantry (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=15848)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bulbog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It's not a Legends only item, was going to guess it was a hard LDoN drop but those are rec lvl65 items.  My guess would be something like PoMischief or one of the newly revamped zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aluaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Lucy database hasn't been updated since before ldon came out, plus everything in PoM v2 has been no drop.<br />
<br />
Recommended level 53 means it's probably a tier 2 PoP drop so.... Valor, Storms, Torment, or CoD.  If I had to pick one, I'd guess rare drop from named skeleton or soldiers in Valor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zynth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i think it's a drop from one of the justice trials. the reason you dont see many of the other items from the trials is because everyone did the execution trial. each trial has it's own loot that dropped of randomly spawned named mobs. execution had the bard mace, the vail, and those caster sholders.<br />
<br />
the name would suggest that it comes from justice, valor, or HoH. the recommended lvl is the same as the junk from justice. it's a shame everyone did the execution trials, when i was lvl 60 i really could of used a decent HP replacement for my lodi shield.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Surlok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Quite a few dropped around when pop was first introduced not seen any lately htough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Krassus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">drops from named golem that aerin dar spawns towards end the big one</div></div><hr />
