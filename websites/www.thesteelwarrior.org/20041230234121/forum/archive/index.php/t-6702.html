Any warrior race with poor melee stats can be buttressed to be as good as any other race.  That being said, a Gnome (or a Dark Elf like me) will have to work harder to max STA than an Ogre.  With the gear that's out there, there really isn't a *wrong* race - there are races that are easier to begin certain classes than others are.<br />
<br />
Personally, I think that the Clockwork Observer Armour (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/itemlist.html?searchtext=clockwork+observer) stuff is a collection of really neat toys.  A Rallos Zek worshipping Gnome could also mix and match with Fierce Heraldic (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/itemlist.html?searchtext=Fierce+Heraldic) items.<br />
<br />
The main thing is always to do what's the most fun ... me, I have a lot of fun playing Gnomes.  I dunno why, I just do.  Maybe it's the potbelly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renix</div><div class="date">04-15-2004, 02:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You have two choices when it comes to picking a race for your warrior;<br />
<br />
1) What you think is fun<br />
<br />
2) What is most effecient/easiest.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you want to play a gnome or halfing, go for it. <br />
<br />
However, if you pick a race that can choose Rallos Zek as their diety, you'll have a significantly easier time playing. Fierce Heraldic gear is comparible to ornate gear, but it costs MUCH, MUCH less, and you can even make it yourself if your up to getting your smithing to grandmaster and farming the components for it. <br />
<br />
If you choose an ogre warrior that worships rallos zek, you'll have the highest starting STR, STA, and you're guarenteed to never be stunned from the front - which is great. Other classes have to spend AA points to have a reduced chance at being stunned, and ogres can get it as well to be practically unstunnable from any direction.</div></div><hr />

However, if you pick a race that can choose Rallos Zek as their diety, you'll have a significantly easier time playing.<br />
<br />
A good point ... when I mentioned that Gnomes could fold Fierce Heraldic into their gear, I didn't check to see if they could choose RZ as their deity, I only checked LUCY to see if they were on the list of races which could equip it, and assumed that they could in fact do so.<br />
<br />
Personally, if I had it all to do over again I'd pick a Gnome.  Maybe a halfling.  They're funnerer.<br />
<br />
I wanna play a Harfling Beastlord with a bunny companion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How can you beat thier clicky gear? 30 str, 30 dex, sow speed legs, 40% haste when no chanter arround. And then you can swap to real stat gear.<br />
<br />
Even now I save that clicky gear to swap off some times. Although I am out growing some of it now.<br />
<br />
But this is my twink.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
But as someone said the tinkered armor gives us some really really nice buffs.<br />
<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/searchdb.html?iname=clockwork+watchman<br />
we get 40% haste, invis, Sow, dex, str buffs etc...<br />
<br />
Also we are already max shrunk so we dont need to worry about that when cornering mobs. Its very easy to get a different illusion item when you dont want to be shrunk.</div></div><hr />

Anyway, as people have said, with the droppable gear out there it's really up to you what race you want to play- you aren't limited much by race.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KunabKB</div><div class="date">04-16-2004, 01:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Definately agree with everyone who replied: play what makes you happy.<br />
<br />
I made a Vah Shir warrior when Luclin was semi-new and have had a blast playing him. Like gnomes, there aren't a ton around but unlike gnomes there wasn't any cultural gear. At points it was a pain, but the further along in levels I got, the less it mattered.<br />
<br />
The game is at a point now with ornate armor and ldon stuff, that you don't have to be a high-end gamer to max out a few stats. <br />
<br />
Play what makes you happy, in the end you'll be glad you did.</div></div><hr />

What do you like to play?   DO you like being a gnome warrior or the halfling warrior?    Why ask other people what race for YOU to play.  You are playing the toon not them choose what makes you happy not what makes everyone else happy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ultrazen</div><div class="date">04-21-2004, 09:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I Know...hehe , but Races i feel ill have fun with is Uniq ones for the class ..id like to be a uber warrior , but uniq ..most ppl choose ogre , troll etc cause they the best for that class....but wanna be different ...so was thinkin either : <br />
(1) Gnome<br />
(2) Wood Elf<br />
(3) Dark Elf<br />
<br />
Id put iksar there ...but they cant wear Fierce nor cobalt...and to Twink a iksar be very xpensive cause to have Good gear ( to make up the loss for no Fierce ) would be stuff like boots of the Storm , Velium encrusted gaunts and both on my server is 100k each LOL<br />
So any advice on what u guys think out of those choices?</div></div><hr />

^^^ Zigackly!  It's clear to me you want to go gnome, all races are viable for the classes they can play, and gear will catch up to any stat deficiency.  Go gnome, and dump all yer creation points into STA to give that a head-start if you like.  I'm a long way from fully geared, but most nights my melee stats are maxxed.  And a Gnome and Dark Elf start off pretty close to each other iirc.</div></div><hr />

I would never be happy playing an evil race, or being so big that I block halls... so TRolls and Ogres are out.  Barbarians may have some starting stat advantages but I really wonder how they live with the terrible body odor (you know they put Halas behind a lake so they would at least have to bathe before they came into town.)  You have stated valid reasons not to pick an Iksar.  My own logic tells me you don't really want to be an assling.  <br />
<br />
Pick the Gnome, they are cool.  You get the exp bonus, the cool cultural armor with all the fun effects, you can corner tank stuff without needing to get shrink, and best of all... you get a bird's eye view of all the camel toe !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blizterkrieger</div><div class="date">04-22-2004, 11:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">an ohh the camel-toe is nice sometimes. Bringin a tear to my eye. Of course, I also have to deal with ogres/trolls/kitties/lizards. and sometimes those are very very bad visuals. I do have some excelent screen shots of tanking tunare somewhere, saryn passed out on the floor, and xeg's ankles somewhere too. If you really want some fun as a gnome warrior, head to most the LoY zones. I solo dulak for hours just for the human/dark elf/erudite barmaids/tavern wenches/scouts. of course on the flip side, the troll/ogres are enough to make one ill after all that time.</div></div><hr />

I worked my way up from 80 sta to just about the best I can do, and I had alot of fun along the way.</div></div><hr />

Do what you want to do and have fun doing it, this is a game and the only reason most people play it (i assume ) is to have fun, your basically letting your game expirence turn into high school.<br />
<br />
ill say this i know a couple gnome warriors and they rock, being a good warrior is not about race, its about skill, if you have the skill then it doesent matter what race you are (and you can deften your skill)<br />

<br />
But then I've always played shorties :)  I originally made Ernie back when Velious came out (my previous main was a gnome enchanter).  I loved the whole gnome pirate thing in Velious so I made a rip snortin, beserkin, blood lustin, wench pinchin, Rallos Zek worshipin WARRIOR!!  I have had a ton of fun role playing him, then and now.<br />
<br />
Just so happens that as a RZ worshipper I have access to some great gear (although most of it is replaced by now, whee!) and as a gnome I am ze corner tank extroidanniore!  I do wish I had put all my bonus points on creation into STA (or heck even CHA) instead of STR, as STR is probably the most easily raised stat with gear.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I completely agree with everyone who said &quot;Make what YOU want to play!&quot;  Have fun and enjoy the game!</div></div><hr />
