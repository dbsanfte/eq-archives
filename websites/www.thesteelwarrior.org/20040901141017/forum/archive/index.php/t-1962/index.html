<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Trast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">From my own retail experience your real friends are going to be happy you're moving on to something better. Just be glad you got the oppertunity to work with them and that you enjoyed it. My last year or so at Best Buy turned into a joy ride of flaming death until I finally had enough. The best thing about retail is the people you meet, the worst thing is all the rest of the people :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>TaiilChayser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Grats on yer new gig Azlana =) hope it all works out for ya... Just promise us you wont be slacking in your posting.. some of us need you to get thru our days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Friedrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Woot, congratulations on the new opportunity.  Sometimes in life you have to move past what is comfortable for new and better opportunities.  I realize you have met some very nice people in your current job but I think they will be very happy for you.  If you cannot see yourself staying in your current job forever, then I would suggest taking the new opportunity that has presented itself.<br />
<br />
Good luck and I am confident that everything will work out for you.<br />
<br />
P.S.  Still waiting to see the pictures from your spray painting adventures *grins*</div></div><hr />
