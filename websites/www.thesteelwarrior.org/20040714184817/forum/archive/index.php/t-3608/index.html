<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ragnarz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A long while back someone had done an awesome round of parsing and generated a graph showing the increase in mitigation/absorbtion as AC went up. Now months later, many more people have hit the 2k+ AC mark. <br />
<br />
So here it is, at what point does that additional AC not make any difference at all?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Solinar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nobody has come up with a new AC cap and results that prove it.  I hope to do some AC testing up to 2500ish AC soon if I can score a mask and a RZ shield.</div></div><hr />

AC always has some effect, the question is whether or not those effects are worth giving up comparable amounts of hp for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thorbadin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The diminishing returns start pretty low, let's say 1600-1700?  It basically start when your highest number of specific hit is for minimum damage.  Since you cannot redcuce a hit below minimum dmg (with shielding you can thought, but different thing) you start experiencing a diminishing return on ac versus dmg reduction.  This can only start to happen when you already mitigate alot of dmg and not like it was with the velious cap where on mobs you were not really mitigating alot of dmg but you could get no added benefit from higher ac.<br />
<br />
Boss mobs hit much harder then your average trash xp mob and you will start experimenting with a diminishing return much later.<br />
<br />
There is probably a cap somewhere, but at least now it seem to be high enough that people aren't easily reaching it.<br />
