<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">12-14-2003, 02:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just sitting here, on a Sunday afternoon, not doing anything ... and realized that this is the last weekend before the &quot;patch.&quot;<br />
<br />
Next week, lots of things are going to change.<br />
<br />
Melee classes are going to start to become radically different.<br />
<br />
My game. Your game. It's going to change.<br />
<br />
So, here, I raise a toast on this final weekend, to all you warriors.<br />
<br />
To the warriors who've been playing since Day 1, starting off in your newbie tunics and your rusty swords, running from those fire beetles back to the safety of your guards.<br />
<br />
To the warriors who started just last week, with max sense heading, a free WR bag with the expansions you bought, and who knows what other goodies.<br />
<br />
To the warriors who used to sport bronze and feel uber.<br />
<br />
To the warriors who used to sport Cobalt and feel uber.<br />
<br />
To the warrior who sport Raex's and feel uber.<br />
<br />
To the warriors parsing out the differences between Vanazir, the Darkblade of the Warlord, and any other plane of time weapons you can get your data streams to analyze.<br />
<br />
To the warriors who wouldn't even consider parsing a Forlorn Naginta!<br />
<br />
To each and every one of you.<br />
<br />
Here's to the past four years of Everquest. And here's to the upcoming changes. The future holds some hope.<br />
<br />
:-)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">12-14-2003, 03:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's where I got the idea that these were going live in the next patch:<br />
<br />
The 24th they held a chat with us about these changes. From the transcripts of those chats, this question was answered:<br />
<br />
&lt;avancouvering&gt; *Coronis* When are you anticipating these changes going live on regular servers?<br />
&lt;Osmith&gt; Our changes are expected to go live during the December 16th update that'll be happening next month. We also plan on introducing them to the Test Server very soon. Feel free to log on the Test Server and use /feedback to tell us what you think about our changes. We'd be happy to hear everyone's thoughts on the systems that are being created.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm also gonna assume there's going to be changes (and/or nerfs, however you look at it) to correct problems after it's been live for a little bit.  So much difference when having 1/100 or so of your player base doing the testing, so I expect changes to come to the live versions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm anxious to get them as well - but simply put they aren't ready.</div></div><hr />

<br />
/cheer the warriors who have had to put up with shit from guildies about agro!<br />
<br />
and cheer every warrior for getting together like we do to get something said (and forcibly heard *hides the tape rope and knife*)</div></div><hr />

 The opening system wont be going live on the 16th from what I've been told. However, I believe the new endurance bar and new disciplines will.  &quot;<br />
<br />
So, rumor is something's getting patched the 16th. Maybe it'll just be provoke, sneak attack and the phantom wind line of skills?<br />
<br />
Maybe it'll be the dodge from behind and the mitigation boost?<br />
<br />
In any event, the changes are coming. Things are gonna be different, very very soon.<br />
<br />
Thus, I still raise my glass in toast to the everquest warrior community. It's been a long, strange ride. And there's still some walking left to do.<br />
<br />
:-)</div></div><hr />

Here's hoping I'll finally be able to get low on mana when we have a warrior tank instead of staying near full because I'll gank it otherwise.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To all the warriors who parsed, tested, despaired, bitched, pissed, moaned, bickered, argued ... even the ones who are dead wrong :p.<br />
<br />
Whenever the changes come, /toast them too.<br />
<br />
EDIT::I really should be able to spell warrior.  Really.</div></div><hr />

To all the warriors who've ever had enchanters bitch at them about taunting, before mez break or after (bitter?  naaah).<br />
<br />
To everyone toasted before...and to quote office space:<br />
<br />
Fucking A.  Fucking A.</div></div><hr />

Another toast, this one for every warrior who was told how taunt works ... by someone who didn't have a frickin' clue.  And did it right anyway, no matter how loudly the group howled.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">12-15-2003, 04:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">From Khavok on the monk boards:<br />
<br />
&quot;The new discipline system and endurance bar will be in this patch. We're still some making adjustments to the costs, timers, and effects before then. It's possible that further changes may be made for the next patch as well, if necessary. We'll continue to review the impact of those changes and the response to them.&quot;<br />
<br />
He also said the monk phantom wind line and openings will NOT be going live yet.<br />
<br />
He or someone else should probably be thinking about posting here whether or not the provoke line will go live.<br />
<br />
He also didn't mention dodge from behind. Hopefully they'll mention innate mitigation bonus when they address warriors.<br />
<br />
So ... they doing this bit by bit. Which is probably a good thing.<br />
<br />
But the game will be changing slightly wednesday.<br />
<br />
We'll be able to use all sorts of new strategies involving our respective disciplines.<br />
<br />
Ought to be fun for a bit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As long as we get endurance, unlinked + tweaked disciplines and the provoke line of abilities on the 16th, i'm going to be one VERY happy warrior.<br />
<br />
A /toast to all :D</div></div><hr />
