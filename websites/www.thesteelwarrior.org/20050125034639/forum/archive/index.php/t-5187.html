<br />
I quit EQ about 3 years ago with a level 50 warrior (actually right after my warrior dinged).  At that time I had pretty decent equipment.  <br />
<br />
About a month or so ago, Sony gave a 30 day trial to relog on with chars restored (if they were ever really deleted).  Well I've decided to start playing again, but my equipment is old and outdated.  Also a bunch of my friends who stayed for awhile after I left, stripped my character.<br />
<br />
I only have about 3k in the bank and know I need some new equipment.  Any suggestions would be great.  <br />
<br />
Here is a link to my profile:<br />

Thanks in Advance.<br />

<br />
Also get your new provoke line book from the PoK library and turn it in to the war gm to get your new discs set up. It'll help you keep aggro a bit easier, especially if you're going to stick with 2HS. <br />
<br />
I might suggest though that you looks around the Bazaar for a good set of 1HS's. You can usually find some decent dmg/dly ration items (various names) on the market for your price range and getting a solid setup on your weapons would be a worthy expenditure.<br />
<br />
I know there's definately better gear to be had (Ornate and Time/Elemental) but if you want, take a look at my gear for some ideas.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps a little...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even if your 2hb skill is zero it's well worth having, and on most servers you can buy them for less that 200pp.<br />
<br />
Also, the Butcherblock LDoN camp has a set of armor for 150 points a piece, most of which would be an upgrade to what you are wearing.<br />
<br />
I didn't see a haste item in your profile, and 3k should be plenty to get yourself an FBSS and a Greatstaff of Thunder these days.</div></div><hr />

<br />
'Bout the same haste as the FBSS but the extra AC and stats make them more desireable.<br />

<br />
It would really help us to know how much plat you have to work with for upgrades.  If you only have the 85pp in your magelo then just keep doing LDoN that is about all you can do right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dwh1969</div><div class="date">01-16-2004, 11:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have 2k plat now.  I've bought a couple of decent dmg/delay 1h weapons, a cobalt helm, and some silver chitin gloves. <br />
<br />
I'm continuing to do LDoN adventures with the hope of getting some of the LDoN armor.  <br />
<br />
I bought a GSOT before realizing the level restriction but got it cheap (200p).<br />
<br />
Thanks for the advice.<br />

First, thanks for posting this; my warrior is basically in the same gear position as yours, and I'm broke too.<br />
Some short-term AC &quot;bump&quot; ideas you *might* be able to afford:<br />
You might be able to find a Chitinous belt (AC 13, STR 5, STA 5, WIS 5, SV disease 10) if you kept the straw belt and put haste in your hands. Could watch for glimmering mithril torque for neck slot (AC 15, STR 2)--not a final solution, but a bump in AC.<br />
Also the large LDoN visors are showing up in the bazaar cheap on my server anyway, and would be a slight bump  for that slot if you don't want to wait for one to drop.<br />
Cobalt boots (AC 25, clicky STR) drop from Caller of Sathir in Karnor's in courtyard 1 (well, okay, sometimes they drop, sigh), so if you wanted an LDoN break you could try that for a lootable boot upgrade.<br />

<br />
For your haste item, you can get better than an fbss on my server for about 3-5K, a 21% belt from PoA (the dropped one not quested) but with some stats, unlike an fbss. But I think that's a nodrop item on most servers.... so get a pickup PoA raid invite and loot one, they drop fairly commonly :)</div></div><hr />
