<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Northerner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know, he's pretty gimpy content for a lot of the folks here but he's been a pretty hard speebump in out progression.  Again, I know that RZ is going to be a far greater test but hey, we are learning as we go for the most part.<br />
<br />
Our situation is this, we have a few good warriors (by our standards, mostly buffing to 9k or so with a standout MT who does enough LDoN and such to hit in the 10k area with about 300 AAs) and a big spread in the guild.  Our dps is low, without a doubt but improving.  In general we field raids of higher numbers and lower AAs/utility.  We can knock out Grummus/TT/Ssra-content/MB and things of that nature but the Bert cycle still seems to leave us in trouble.<br />
<br />
Two issues are predominate I guess.  One is spawning Bert in a reasonable length of time and that frankly is all on us.  We have a number of ways of improving how we do so and we shall get that down on our own in due time.  The second and more worrisome one though is what to do with Bert once we get him.<br />
<br />
He just kinda eats tanks in a hurry.  I know that we've worked out some basic heal-chains and the like but I would love a little direction here.  We are lucky to see the cycle up and we are getting burned out on it, being a largely casual raiding guild.  I don't really want full spoilers but any advice on killing the fellow himself would be appreciated.  Perhaps it is just a AoW written large but a few pointers would be more than welcome and we don't get enough opportunities at the cycle to just figure it out as past guilds have done.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your time,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gnomos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hook up with all your healers and go off in a quiet zone (like qeynos) and PRACTICE.  What you want to see is a CH land on you every 2 seconds, like clockwork.  Work with the CH rotation until you get this down.  You probably need to do this with the rampage tank too, you have to keep them both alive, or rampage will eat your healers after it eats the RT.<br />
<br />
Log all the cast messages and the messages that say &quot;You are completely healed.&quot;  Examine the time stamps on them in the log file, figure out where your mistakes are, and fix them.  When you can achieve 2 seconds consistently, and maintain it long enough to kill him, then you are ready.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hyardgune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My guild is probably similar to yours and we're 2 for 2 on Bert (although we got lucky as hell on try #2).  We split into two groups for the clearing although the groups will usually help each other out on the harder kings.  We leave the last king up and go down one of the wings, I think it is east.  We get the MT cornered and the casters in a room to the side and pull the last king.  Kill the king and then pull Bert.  Casters are behind a wall.  We had ramp issues last time and the MT died during the Enrage which meant a shitload of other people died when Bert turned.  Somehow we got him burned down though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Bertoxx is mean mofo but with pathetic HP just like all the minis. Just burn his ass down while everyone tryes to heal MT/RT. Make sure to be aware of spawning him and not having anyone/anything train him on the raid. Proper engage almost guarantees the win because of his pathetic hp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">wrong casai, my guild got bert on our first try this past weekend and we were parsing it and the melee alone did 372k damage to him, the parser didnt pick up dots or nukes so thats at least 400k HP on him, although he has pretty low AC, but factor in that his AE is also an attack debuff and his HP isnt patheric. most bert fights last as short as they do based on the huge ass raids most people bring to him.<br />
<br />
once the event started we just didnt stop pulling, important for pulls to be constant and people to do their best. we had mid 60s in numbers and not been through VT yet and we spawned bert with about 30 minutes remaining on the clock, if you have the time then take it, dont rush bert if ya dont have to, hes pretty rough.<br />
<br />
was a close fight since we had our rampage tank pull to me in the corner i was tanking but his melee range is HUGE and killed the ramp tank before i could even go grab aggro when eventually meant the death of some clerics. i had 9.6k tanking bert and some bert melee rounds were extremely close, his top round did 8.3k on me</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have to agree with Bigchest.  Bert's HP aren't as low as some people make it out to be, but he still generally goes down pretty fast because most raids go near all-out and have an array of CoD pets wailing on him as well.  <br />
<br />
Killing Bert is simply managing his outragious damage output.  He'll mow through even a Time level warrior with ease if you don't take him seriously.  On top of that, ya can't fuck around on his rampage damage either.  <br />
<br />
And oh yeah, Bert-like dps is the norm in the elementals.  Get used to it.  Hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Raunstonecutter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I enjoy the bert event when things go well.  When we do him we have a MA some add tanks, and mezers.  The MA pretty much calls the doom on the mobs (and try to tank).  The split tankers grab a couple of the mobs and the chanters mez the rest.  and we work from 5-8 pulls of mobs, with our pulling team dying constantly (ah man thats funny there!).  Our pull team will then pull the kind and whatever adds it get, king gets killed, adds get mezed.  Rinse, repeat, recycle.  For last king, we bum rush him in his room, mezing/tanking adds while he goes down (along with 10-12 other people for fun).  Once we're all happy, we run a sacrifical DA pally to position bert where we want him to (usually a corner).  Once bert is there, MA goes out with celestial regen, and probably a rune for good measure.  We corner tank him (should things go well), and he dies.  Sure, he's a 2k hitter, but with good heals, he's not too bad.  I even tanked him when my max hp was 7800ish (like 2 monthes ago and that was b/c MA went splat).  Now with the unchained disciplines, I'd say send MA in after DA pally with invulnurbility (sp).  Those 12 seconds should buy some time for MA/RT to get some agro clerics don't get chewed up.  If all goes well, and MA/RT survive, if healers don't run OOM (bard and necro =) ) then bert should fall before your defensive wears off.<br />
<br />
Good luck, and hopefully I was helpful =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Use all of your raid's pets to eat the rampage.  Send them in while the main tank is invulnerable in the first 12 seconds.  This will prevent the healers from dying one by one to rampage. <br />
<br />
This fight is not much easier than Mith Marr, to be honest.  Everyone calls Bert a gimp, and his DPS and HP therefore both surprised me when I first faced him.  To me, &quot;gimp&quot; meant something like Agnarr, and Bert is a much tighter fight than Agnarr.  The others are right, don't underestimate him.<br />
<br />
I recommend not pulling Bert, because pulling seems to be a guaranteed way to lose one or more people.  Have the MT run into the corner and engage Bert in place, and position the pets so that they push toward the correct corner from the start.  Supernal Remedy can reach the tank from most of the way across the room.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">There are multiple ways to pull Bert, really.  The adds in the center room don't assist him, thank Brell!  :P<br />
<br />
We pull him with a warrior hitting Fortitude and running back to the raid force.  Bert's melee range is HUGE, so it's generally not a good idea to tag him with an arrow un-disced and run as he's liable to off you in a heartbeat with your back turned to him.  On the plus side, Fortitude blocks rampage damage whereas Furious does not.  I know it saved my ass once as Bert ramped twice in a row before he was Crippled.  With RT already set, MT grabs him and begins tanking.  Once Fortitude ends on the RT, the RT hits Defensive/Stonewall and begins meleeing away.  <br />
<br />
As far as Ramp healers for Bert, we use three.  Since I play my own cleric as a second box, I'm often the RT for this event (And for a lot of events).  CH is NOT a good idea, lol.  It's simply too slow.  My guild leader also 2boxes a cleric, so he's healing me as well.  We just add a shaman or druid to the fray and RT healing is handled pretty well via quickheals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I dont mean he is a gimp but his hp is patheticly low. 400k is not much especially if he is not mele/magic resistant and he isnt. lets say average person doing 150ish burst dps for this fight he will drop in less then a minute with 50ppl and most first time Bertoxx raids are 60+ I am sure. So his hp is patheticly low.</div></div><hr />

<br />
He has more than 400k.  I've parsed him for 520k in melee and non melee damage, not including damage shield and dot damage so I'm estimating 550-600k.  At that stage of the game, with a raid force of 50-60 ppl they are probably doing 2800-3300 dps as a guild, more if they have several CoD pets (charm the adds) so it'll still be roughly a 3 minute fight for them if all goes well.  My parses on Bert a year old but with the new melee discs, guild dps would increase several hundred so the fight would last 10-15 seconds less.<br />
<br />
The main key is keeping both the MT/RT alive and setting up rampage correctly.  IMO it's too risky to send in pets for rampage because if they all die, anyone can end up on rampage.  Bert swings at 1.5 sec delay and will do roughly 1000-1200 dps on your tank, give or take a few depending on gear / aa.  Slap a bard in with the tank group for the extra AC from the songs plus damage shield.  A 180-200 DS on MT and RT is worth 40-50k damage alone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Derrict</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Forgot to mention - if your enc have the LDoN stun, use it and AE the event.  The last time I did the Bert ring we had Bert up in 52 minutes.  The old fashion clearing usually took 75 min before he was spawned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">its also important to remember his AE is an atk debuff making his &quot;pathetically low&quot; hp actually last longer. id go by derrict's hp numbers since the ones i had only parsed melee dmg against him.<br />
<br />
and sass i was always under the impression mith marr was gimpish compared to bert and even RD. honestly i think rampage is one of the hardest things in PoP since mobs hit like trucks and non permarooted mobs are always harder to set ramp on, with MM's fake rampage id assume hes much more manageable. on a side note is strike of marr resistable? ive heard it isnt but allakhazam/lucy said its only a -150 resist check which is pretty resistable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Yes, you'll resist it sometimes at 500 MR.  But you'll find that you don't resist it on the lucky round where MM swings for 3x2000 and procs twice. :P  I feel that chain spellshields are better insurance than 500 MR.  (But then that's mana that could have been spent killing MM... decisions decisions.)<br />
<br />
I think the real challenge with MM is that the encounter is unforgiving of mistakes.  No class other than warrior can really cope with unexpected aggro in this zone, at least not if this is still an advancement flag for your guild.  One bad MM pull, or one person sitting down on inc, or one healer goes linkdead, or one wrulan pet warps to bind point, and you have a hard time getting things under control before 10 people are dead on the floor.  But this is a thread about Bert not MM =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>shadowedspawn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">We use the tried and true pull team trains the guild w/ mobs strat.  Pullers bring in mobs constantly so that there is always a few in camp mezzed/getting zeked at all times.  We use mez and a pally MA on the trash and save the wars for the kings.  we alwyas use the same corner (as you face the summoner of bert go to the right hand corner) and tank and kill all kings and bert in the corner to the left of that one (as you face out of it).  We use a SK for ramp tank (pull w/ HS and he live to get Bert into corner and get the heal chain working), and SS and rune the MT.  We also dont use any pets until Bert is in the corner (go go swarm pet push!!).  The total event usually runs us about an hour and 15 minutes depending on if all our monks are on or if the SK's are helping w/ pulls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Whatever you wana say Bertox drops dead in about 2 minutes. I understand my hp statement wasnt correct, but it is still a very short fight and thats exactly what I was driving at. Once you get pull/pin down I never seen a loss, even when MA goes down in 30 sec.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">What we have done on bert is to kill the last king at his spawn spot.  When bert spawns in the middle we send the rampage tank in to pull him with BDA on.  When that wears off, if bert still isnt back in the camp the rampage tank can use fortitude.<br />
<br />
As others have said Bert's dps output is pretty high, but he goes down fast.  You will definately kill him before defensive goes down on either the rampage tank or the main tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gasmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Ok my guild just killed bert for the second time recently after 4 wipes on our first 4 tries, after the third wipe we tried a new strategy which works very well for us. First off your guild should try going over this strat once when SoC is not up. But anyways our basic strat is to kill all the kings at there spawn point. You need to know your way around the basement well and your guild needs to pay attention. The first step is to kill mobs until first king spawns. At the point the guild leaves the middle area and never returns to that point, that is very important. When you reach the first spawn point have your guild wait at the bottom of the ramp. Have your puller on the opposite side of the spawn room. The puller tags the king and all the adds and runs back away from the guild. At this point the spawn room is empty and the entire raid force moves into the room. The king usually 99% of the time returns solo because all of the adds corpsecamp the FD monk back in the hall. Engage the name and kill him, have chanters watching for returning adds during the fight though 99% of the time we killed the king before any adds returned. At this point it is very important that you have mapped a route to the next spawn point and can get your entire raid there without ever going in the middle room.  Do this for all the kings and it saves a ton of time from trying to pull adds from spawn room and then pulling king after, plus you don't have to worry about repops in the middle room.<br />
<br />
As far as Bert is concerned just fight max melee, if your having trouble keeping your MT up even if your rot is good i'd suggest having a chanter chain cast runes on him and plenty of spot heals.<br />
This strat has worked well for us and good luck killing that bastard.</div></div><hr />
