<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fulrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok i am one of the very man poor warriors out there who needs new equip badly. I want to start farming RM but i can't do it solo wich really sucks. I wanna buy an ikky bp for the regen so i can solo em. Its just where am i gonna get the money for one? its all one big death cycle out to kill me unless the guild i'm in all of a sudden gets good enough to go get the items i wanna farm plat to get! Any tips on what you guys do to make plat? i'm lvl 61 now btw and like to farm solo if possible. And farming silks and stuff just doesn't cut it on Dro. the best method so far is giant farming with 40pp drops but 1 giant get me down to 60% hp and that shows how badly i need new equip!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Binnamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">go camp the BP!<br />

It drops off named in traks tooth, the same zone needed for the Seb key.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Get some embalmers skinning knives and work on ure bind wound skill.  Also grab a Weighty polearm if you dont have a two hander.  I solo'ed there at lvl 60 for a bit just using bind wound.  Could kill about 3-4 giants before I have to bind.  When ure skill is 201, u can bind up to 70% (unless you got AA's)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Varaho</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You are level 61 and cannot kill the giants in RM?<br />
<br />
What gear are you using?<br />
<br />
You said you were in a guild, grab a few of them along for the ride.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Khiloor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">tradeskills, tradeskills, tradeskills.  that's where the money is.  farming these items, and getting one high enough so you can actually make a profit.   I found this out when I was level 30, way back in the day, and now money is not an issue. <br />
<br />
I tried the RM giants the other week, not bad coin. But too much work.  I'd rather run rampant through a lower level dungeon, killing massive amounts of level 15-25 mobs, farming tradeskill items that sell in bazaar.  Don't get like 5 then try and sell, get like 50+ then sell them.  You'd be surprised how quickly you'll get a tells from other ppl wanting a deal to buy you out.  The best i ever did was farmed for 4 hours one night, and made 13k in the bazaar overnight selling the stuff i farmed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i always ganked gobbys in Runnyeye for coin, and the damn black alloy neck sells for 300-500pp; and make about 100pp an hour or so.<br />
the suck part about RM or Ice giants in perma/everfrost is a long way off to go trade in coin.<br />
<br />
runnyeye bank assoc. is teh win :D it's funded my fletching addiction since day 1 and neevr had a qualm about it...hell, i even get bored and go beat up them assling guards for their drops ( sell for @10pp for their spear, sheld, and little sword )..kill a couple of gobbys and faction's right back to where it was ( i'm even ally to that stupid evil eye faction Xorbb :p )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Darkoan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Wasn't Runnyeye revamped?  I can't believe someone is making anything off that zone..  Please elaborate further :)<br />
<br />
.. As for ikky bps, how much are they?  Fungi's are down to 36k on 7th Hammer, I can't imagine an ikky bp costing more than a few K..?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Khiloor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">killing green gobbos and getting like 1-2 plat / kill, plus some ok mid / low level items, black alloy medallion has mana pres 2 on it, and sells pretty good.  black alloy bastardsword / longsword sells ok to lower level chars.  at the bottom of runnyeye there is a bank.  since there's a bank there, you don't have to come back up to sell or unload your stuff.   heh, i remember going thru xorbb when i was level 14, and getting blinded by the golems, and charmed by the EE's. fun times.<br />
<br />
geez. you're a DE warrior? find some easy guards to pick on and just camp them if you're not worried about faction.  halfling guards at the misty thicket wall are pretty good (and close to pok book).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">to darkoan:<br />
<br />
believe me it ain't like robbing a bank or anything but for the time it takes to clear the entire zone of runnyeye and hit the bank at the end it's good enough for some accumulation. I usually go in, kill the whole caster/evil eye side of the zone first; than progress to demolishing the bank /canal side than hitting the bank. takes about 35 minutes; fills aabout 3 backpacks with BA/BI/muslin gear that sells for a few pp each to a vendor plus making about 75pp in coin per run. runners suck because the doors are all screwy and they're too annoying to chase most of the time.<br />
usually when i'm sick of selling the BA/BI/muslin stuff i usually equip every assling in Misty with a full set of gear.<br />
<br />
it's too bad he's a DE; Neriak-Commons is fun to hunt in too</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">thanks, a friend made it for me</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">i'm lvl 61 now btw and like to farm solo if possible.

<br />
You can't possibly be serious.  Hill giants are 25 levels lower than you, they're not gonna be hitting you at all.  I have a hard time believing any level 61 warrior loses more than half a bubble off a hill giant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Raunstonecutter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I used to run through RM, tag as many as I could, get about 6 and go nuts with 'em.  The worst I got was 2 bubbles of life.  Though that was a while ago, with about 4700-4800 unbuffed hps.<br />
<br />
RM is fun for a short while, but it is too much work.  And I never had any luck in RE Shik.  Didn't make any real plat with over an hour of clearing, and only got some BA boots.  Maybe I just had a bad night.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Fulrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">ok i went a little overboard with the 1 giant getting me down to 60%, actually its more 85-75%. I have just under 3100hp unbuffed, This shows how much i need to get new equip. i can't really count on the guild to help me get new equip on the source(mob). Yeah so i started using a weighty polearm(25p in the baz!) on giants and now giants get me to about 90% before they run and thats only with 22% haste. If i had chanter haste the would run before i was at 95%. Anywho, now seeing as theres almost always a druid around i pay em togive me SoW and a regen when i need it then i farm way faster. I'm new to RM and i think i'll be there awhile before i get to levelling again. Oh and i tried the RE idea too, Didn't work out too great either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>arative</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I dont know if you server is anything like mine but you can purchase buffs in PoK. Comes in handy when I want to solo or get some KEI for tradeskills. Some good places to get plat, seafurys in OOT, drop gems. Seb is fairly good too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">3 words, high hold keep. i made 5k in 8 hours tonight, best money ive ever made and its been there so long there isnt gona be a narf</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Fulrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">what do you do in in HHK to get money?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Jaago</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Ok Fulrik, repeat after me:   Kill......The......Guards!!!  And the Nobles and the Bards and pretty much anything else that moves:p  Loot the swords and shields and anything else they have and sell it to any of the vendors there.  And there's even a bank downstairs for you to use.<br />
<br />
Only downside to killing them(other than its camped almost as bad as RM at times) is it'll ruin your faction with Freeport guards(can't remember which ones) and probly Halflings and Dwarves too.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Dakanzzar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Just to re-iterate a post, tradeskill.<br />
<br />
I decided to be a GM fletcher just coz (pre-PoP) THEN Nightmare Bows came out. wow I was making 10-15k a week easy.<br />
<br />
Ok, things aren't that good anymore unless you know how to work the bazaar, but if you are really interested in money you can camp the bazaar, watch the prices, take trades on stuff you fletch (tradeskill), sell at a markup, take trades on those, sell at markup. Use the profit to twink the hell out of your alts, say &quot;Oh bugger, I just wasted 50k on an alt&quot;, camp bazaar some more, buy gear for a main, got to Planes and go LFG, get no groups because you are a warrior and can't stun =p, get annoyed whinge and whine lots to your guild mates, get a guild group, be happy.<br />
<br />
THEN go buy lots of beer and get drunk.<br />
<br />
Ok, slightly off-topic but you get the point.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Dinekus Aleswig</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">If I really need cash I go to seb and solo or box a druid/cleric.  I can usually pull 1k per hour off of just gems and coin drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">kill guards, sell fine steel, kill more guards sell fine steel then bank it.<br />
<br />
as for faction you get a hit with the evil guards in qeynos and the evil guards in FP, you can still go into the good side with the paladins, in qeynos the evil guards are very weak, so if you can handle the HH ones you can kill the qeynos baddies with out much trouble</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">watch out for the qeynos guards...some are sks....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">That's not what you have to watch out for.  Watch out for the evil guards in Qeynos, because Corporal Lancot and Leutentant Arathur will assist them if they attack you.  Also, the gate guards will assist them if they attack you.  Named guys shouldnt be that much of a threat at 61, but the gate guards are insane.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">lol</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Cenyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">yea, many people don't know about invis potions for some reason.... 11pp/shot though =/</div></div><hr />
