I will train it up as far as I can until pp becomes an issue, but from there what should I do?<br />
<br />
My wife is a 50 druid, we are playing together, so I have her help while I work on getting my 2HB up.  So what is the quickest way, and how long do you think it will take me to get it up to my current level?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />

Get as low of a delay 2hb as you can find (poison wind censor is good). Go ask a group if they mind you whackin their mobs for skillups. Once you get your 2hb up to about 75-100 or so, you can start bringing out your 2hb in xp groups without feeling like too much of a drain on the group.</div></div><hr />

<br />
join a raid where your not MT.  Pound away with said shovel.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OgreOverlord</div><div class="date">05-11-2003, 04:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree just get you a good low Delay 2hb and in good groups or on raids just use it as much as you can. you will be suprised how fast it will go up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Never was a problem exept for :<br />
** Truncheon of Doom (cant find any /RUDE)<br />
** Rocksmasher (Had to pass up on 4 of these babies)<br />
<br />
It's not a huge problem, you can live without 2HB.<br />
But ignoring it is a mistake.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">05-11-2003, 06:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a 2hb of 15, all points from trainer as I have never owned a 2hb weapon.  I dont imagine it will take long to skill up if I ever do tho.  I didn't start working on 2hs until I had been 60 for quite a while and worked that up over a week while not tanking in raids / XP groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meface</div><div class="date">05-12-2003, 12:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Instead of using that shovel, You can also try a Poison Wind Censer.   It is  Damage: 20<br />
Delay: 28 <br />
Ratio: 1.4 Amazing <br />
Str: +5 Poison Resist: -30  <br />
Weight: 5.0 <br />
Weapon Skill: Two Hand Blunt <br />
Classes: Shaman Cleric Paladin Shadowknight Warrior  <br />
Races: All Races  <br />
<br />
<br />
Just make sure you are not taking anything on that is gonna smack you with a poison effect of any kind and you will be fine.<br />

(Edit) Forgot to mention I picked this up in the bazaar for 900 plat thought it musta been a heck of a deal.</div></div><hr />

( free 2H blunt is laying on the ground in Lake Rathe inside an orc tent if you need one )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aakla</div><div class="date">05-12-2003, 07:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">dont waste your points just grab a crapy weapon with low delay and go somewhere where people are fighting mobs that are blue or higher thenyou and work on 2hb. I tookmy lvl 40 monk alt to velksandwas working on all my weapon skills in Upper Spiders</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">05-12-2003, 07:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Poison Wind Censer procs an AE, so make sure you aren't near any non aggro mobs or mobs that require crowd control (or are rooted off to the side and can summon if damaged enough).  Other than that it's fine.  If you got little to no cash, the shovel on the ground at the orc camp works great.  Raids where you're not the tank are the best for working it up, but can be done in groups too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">05-12-2003, 12:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Find some blue-con animals, have your wife keep one snared and feared, beat on it's back with a shovel.  This will take forever but it will work.  Otherwise just use it on raids, or as Emilia said, just skip it.  2hb is the one weapon skill that warriors may be able to get by without, although it will limit you from a couple nice weapons like the greatstaff of whateveritis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">05-12-2003, 12:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wouldnt worry too much about it. Ive maxed all mine sept for 2hb which is like 20 atm. Im not that fussed, unless a greatstaff of thunder drops in my hands or i see one for sale which i havent yet, i dont intend on getting it maxed either.<br />
<br />
if i did need to do it, heck i have 50 plus levels of untrained skill points accumulated so id probably just dump as much as i could into 2hb to save the hassle of all those skill ups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azeroke</div><div class="date">05-12-2003, 02:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My 2hb was at a whopping 40 or so for a long time till recently. Got a Greatstaff of Thunder. At 61, I just went to PoI and wacked zin mobs while LFG. Up to like 180 or so now I think. It's only been a few days :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">samagon</div><div class="date">05-12-2003, 11:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">if you have the money, don't put your points in the skill early, they go quick, wait till the end and put them in then, or better yet, save them for a tradeskill that you want to make money off of, and work on the trade, then spend the pp to buy the rest of the skill.<br />
<br />
raising fighting skills are easy. and there are mobs around that (esp at 50) to go and raise your skills on without having to worry too much about taking damage. there is one in tofs on the second floor as a matter of fact that is good till 54 and hits for the mid 40s. take a shaman with you and slow the mob, you are good to go.<br />
<br />
point is, save those skill points for things that make you money.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ladiiesman</div><div class="date">05-13-2003, 08:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1) get a fast wepon....<br />
<br />
2) get a shammy friend who has a level 55 pet..../duel him and whack his pet while he keeps you both healed......go have dinner, rent a whore, come back, skillupz :)<br />
<br />
just make sure the pet is dark blu to you</div></div><hr />
