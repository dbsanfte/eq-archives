<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">warchief</div><div class="date">01-15-2004, 12:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay I am a lvl 37 warrior and I am having frets over where I should be hunting at.  Overthere is sorta bad exp for me cuz I am so high for the zone and sometimes I cant get a group.  LDoNs are good pp and sometimes exp. but they take like an hour to get together.  Dawnshround sucks becuz no one is ever there. (I havent tried like Sol A or B...Should I?)  So anyone know of some popular spots to go for either a group/solo on the xegony server or where ever you hunted at on ur server at 37.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
SolB is a good spot.<br />
<br />
I used to solo in Great Divide on wolves at 37 when no groups were available.<br />
<br />
LDoN, maybe try a set group and time with folks you know?<br />
<br />
Guk!! (Do people still go there?)<br />
<br />
Or the ever popular Dreadlands.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dawnshroud peaks is doable at 37 and should be good exp if you like outdoor zones.  Maybe check some of the other outdoor zones in luclin also.<br />
<br />
Tower of frozen shadow is a riot.  So is lower guk.  If you want to lvl fast prob go to kedge keep.  <br />
<br />
Lvl 37 is when you should be establishing regular party members durring your play time.  Get to know a few clerics, and enchanter/bard/shaman and some other regular group members with similar play times and get to know them.  This is going to be far more rewarding than anything else in the game from my perspective.</div></div><hr />
