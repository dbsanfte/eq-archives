<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donnel</div><div class="date">05-08-2003, 05:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Last night I traded my Beer Stained Coldain Tunic (12 AC +5 STR +5 STA +15 HP +5 to three resists) for a Ry'Gorr Battle Mail (18 AC +10 STR +20 of that odd blue stuff every one besides us seems to love so much)<br />
<br />
I like that when I put on the Mail, my displayed AC raises by 10, but my HP goes down by 30... what is the trade off ratio? When is the HP cut going to outweigh the AC gain (or Vice Verse)? How many HP is equal to 1 AC?<br />
<br />
I'm sure I will like the Ry'Gorr, but this question seems like its going to be about more then just my measly equipment (see the link on my picture)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunrack</div><div class="date">05-08-2003, 06:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I posted something similar and it seems that 1AC=10hp's... but thats just what someone told me.. not sure about that.. only 33 meself..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TaiilChayser</div><div class="date">05-08-2003, 06:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wouldnt worry too much about hp's untill you start to get your AC over 1000 and are regularly grouping with CH'ing clerics. So basically go for the highest AC you can untill late 40's early 50's.<br />
<br />
And for a refrence I generally use the 1ac ~ 10hp's formula when I look at gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">05-08-2003, 09:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah, 1AC=10hp's in a tradeoff either way; but all in all for the pre-50 crowd get the AC going for ya's and the hp's will follow as you level.<br />
Even as a small race; try looking for a dusty BP in the bazaar Donnel; it's a crafted BP clone that's for small races ( been looking for one myself actually ) and usually relatively cheap ( few 100 pp; if that ).</div></div><hr />

Its like saying how many appels = 1orange.   I understand your talking about overall efficency, but it seems situational and subjective to me.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tinuvil</div><div class="date">05-09-2003, 08:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">General formula past 1300ac?<br />
<br />
I tend to go for 5Hp per AC - other opinions please</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donnel</div><div class="date">05-09-2003, 09:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So the general consensus is: Get your AC over 1000 before even worrying about any sort of trade off. <br />
<br />
BTW, 10 AC would be = to around 100 HP by your formula, and I only lost 30, so I think I'm doing okay then LOL.<br />
<br />
Thanks for all your thoughts, I'm just trying to be the best warrior I can be (... in the army?) and I am a glutton for information.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chagen</div><div class="date">05-09-2003, 12:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">While we're sort of on the subject, AC caps are....?<br />
1200- Pre luclin?<br />
1400- Luclin?<br />
1500- PoP?<br />
And are these caps only for raid mobs or xp mobs as well?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tinuvil</div><div class="date">05-09-2003, 12:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">PoP more like 2000</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mokor</div><div class="date">05-09-2003, 04:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">great gear for 35 enjoy the game while you can and worry about hp/ac only when you look for something to buy. when you do look for halfling armor steelweave rocks for agnostic halflings, but it has the +mana instead of +all hp like mose other race armors that fh doesn't is tailored though don't rember if halfling blacksmiths get a armor</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">~Bons~</div><div class="date">05-12-2003, 12:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah SoE has a way of making new standards.....back in luclin cap was around 1250 or so...now with all the VT and PoP have heard the cap is around 1800+ i think i am just over 1300 at 65 with no vt or pop armor but i am happy so pretty much have fun with what you have avaliable at the time loots come and go :)<br />
