<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zamfif</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">OMG, You don't have one proc'ing weapon!<br />
<br />
Bro, Aggro is all about the Proc.  Once you get to a certain level, it is all about the warrior keeping aggro.  In order to do that, you need a weapon that creates major hate.<br />
<br />
Probably the cheapest major aggro weapon I can think of is the Club of the Ice Ocean.    Only drawback is it is 1hb.  But, creates good aggro.  Your ultimate goal should be something with a proc like rage of vallon or something similar.</div></div><hr />

decent weapon although you should add an aug to it, 40 points for Heated Blade aug in north ro wayfarers camp.<br />
<br />
<br />
a few weapons out there for ya so look around. if ya don't have 150+ dex i suggest ya aug a JBoM,  alot of people fail to understand dps agro and the fact that ya need high dex to get a good proc rate. <br />
i use a CHoS and Elite Steelslave stone blade ( 13/19 but only get 12/19 out of it until i hit 60 ) and have GREAT agro but plan to augment my weapons and saveup for a better offhand weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>dumbl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thx for the suggestions going to hang out in the bazaar for a few days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Frostbringer should proc at your level.<br />
<br />
It's pretty good DPS and Aggro.<br />
<br />
And with all the new flashy aggro procs around these days, it's pretty affordable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">very very nice proc aggro weapon and just about oable with some friends is the Praetor Blade of Debility.<br />
<br />
8/22 with a nice AC/dex/str debuff. I used mine through ToV until my epics...<br />
<br />
i think the thread for the quest is in the KEep; if not i'll try to scratch up the details later.<br />
( btw if you're an evil race you prob can't do it unless you get faction )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Xebokan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Buy a Barnacle Covered Axe for a few hundred plat and put it in your pirmary, place your wurmslayer in secondary. You should be fine then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">you'd have to rip his right arm off and glue it to his left arm socket to offhand the wurmy :D .<br />

( it's primary only )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Xebokan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ahh, my bad. Never bothered buying one myself...oh well : )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">no worries; the wurmslayer holds a warm sentimental place in my heart ( from our old EZ Board 'discussions' we used to have years ago )</div></div><hr />

Wurmslayer. <br />

WURMSLAYYER IS DA DEBIL!!!111  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>CedVicious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I have a 44 War.  and I did the buy low sell high thing for a week until I could put together 14K...  Then what did I do?  I bought myself a Copper Hammer of Striking.  My ability to find groups is sometimes based on them knowing I have the hammah.  I know its a lot but trust me.  Work for it and you'll never need to buy another 1hb aggro wep.<br />
<br />
The buy low/buy high was mostly with Fierce Heraldic pieces, clattering bone necks, and cloak of the maelstrom.<br />
<br />
If you get half way with the pp and do not want to wait any longer grab the Sword of the Bloodsworn.  It also has a nice proc.<br />
<br />
My upgrade in weps happened at lvl 39 and it was from Centi Long/Jade Mace to CHoS/Frosty.</div></div><hr />

I twinked out my warrior with these weapons as i had my 65 mage who i am tired of playing to farm. and even at low levels 25+ they create hella damge and proc so in short if you have way to get the plat to purchase either in bazaar do so soon then work on gear IMHO. with these weapons you can travel to 51 easy enough then graba GSoT (great staff of thunder) and have a field day.  And with how easy EQ is in todays game you should be 50 inside of amonths time frame if you exp grind justa little bit.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Oh, and if you want a weapon with an aggro proc that's easy to get, short sword of ykesha is a decent weapon at 40 and the aggro on the proc is a thing of beauty.</div></div><hr />
