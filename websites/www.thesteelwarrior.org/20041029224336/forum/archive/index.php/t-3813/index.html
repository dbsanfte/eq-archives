<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Prytty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My guild is starting to make a push towards the elementals and I could use a bit of advice.  We've killed just about all the tier one and two flag mobs except Bert (we need another Caprin cycle or two to finish flagging) and MM (got RD to 35% first try....next time we should get him).<br />
<br />
The stumbling block we're facing right now is Agnarr.  We do the two mini's leading up to him just fine but we need a refinement in our strat in entering Agnarr's lair to even get a serious shot at him.   Three times we've tried and we wipe before we really even start on him.  What we've been doing to this point is trying to kite Agnarr and friends around while the rest of the raid kills the portals.  Every time the kiter(s) have died, the mobs rush the people killing portals and we wipe.<br />
<br />
I've heard that kiting may not be the way to go from some friends but our raid leader listed a new strat for our next attempt which includes 2 bards kiting to start.<br />
<br />
Anyone have any advice on how to keep things under control while portals are killed so we can actually make a serious shot at killing him?  Any links to good guides or personal advice would be welcomed.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mofu-Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Have your MT tank the mini that is up upon zone in to his lair, rest of the raid force (except your portal squad) kills the adds. Once the portals and adds are dead, everyone assists the MT on the mini (agnarr is being snare kited all this while btw.) When the mini is dead agnarr should be tanked near the stairway up to karana, have your casters in the stairwell safe from aoe. Each time a mini spawns (99/74/49/24 i think)  the MT stays on agnarr along with Rampage tank. The rest kill the mini , once its dead all go back to helping the raid MT on agnarr. When you get to the last mini, we like to kite the last mini while we finish off agnarr.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps ;)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Prytty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">yes we are...although we were light on wizzies last attempt (only had 2) and were using other dps classes to help.<br />
<br />
The problem really hasnt really been killing the portals per se, since we've done that all three times. It's been controlling Agnarr the other named and the Hurricanes so they're not killing people while this was going on.<br />
<br />
I guess I'm looking for advice on where to send people once they zone up i.e. sending the people to the steps, whether to put tanks on the mobs, ect....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>niin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Agnarr is snarable.   Makes him easy to kite.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Myst Darkwind</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have to agree.<br />
<br />
Have agnarr and even the mini named kited while you do get the portals down then move to the mini then to Agnarr.<br />
<br />
Snaring makes the Agnarr encounter failry easy assuming your DPS is good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">(agnarr is being snare kited all this while btw.)<br />
<br />
Rooting is a bit easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ronaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">problem with rooting is - someone WILL fuck it up and Agnarr will start to summon.<br />
<br />
we usually just stick tank + ch chain on agnarr, tash/disintegrate portals, and kill mini + adds.<br />
<br />
can be messy if your MT tells the raid to go up and stays on 2nd level though, watching everyone around him disappear :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zynth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">mofu pretty much summed it up, but i think it's important to note that agnarr cant not take a single point of damage while being kited or he'll start using his AE, or worse yet, summoning the kiters. our kite team uses a combination of snare and roots. the last agnarr run was perfect, the only people that died during the actual agnarr fight were the warriors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grobble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It's pretty trivial once you've done it a few times and have a few wizards, but can be very ugly until you have the encounter down.<br />
<br />
Basically what we do it port up debuffers and a ranger or 2 to snare agnarr.  Nobody can damage Agnarr.  This is very important.  So make sure damage shields are down and you should be able to get the portals disintigrated, Agnarr snared/kited and the first mini occupied fairly easily.  Also, as long as nobody damages Agnarr, it seems as though no adds whatsoever will come from the disintigratable portals.  At least we haven't gotten any the last few tries as long as we don't damage him.<br />
<br />
Once Agnarr is debuffed and snared, we have someone kite him upstairs until portals and first mini are down, at which point everyone moves up.  MT corners Agnarr to the right of the entrance to karana room, clerics hide outside the room against the wall on the stairs.  When the 2nd mini is about to pop, everyone but cheal chain and MT and a few others head down and kill, rinse, repeat.<br />
<br />
We've killed Aggy with as few as 35 people and 3 or 4 clerics using this method.  He's ridiculously trivial now as long we have at least 3 wiz.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Galuvian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If you are getting Hurricanes you are doing something wrong.  Get the portals killed fast and you only need to worry about Agnarr and the tower bosses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Prytty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well, TT is down so we'll prolly try him again today.  Thanks for all the advice and i'll let you know how it goes if we do him.</div></div><hr />

i told them to move up onto the damn platform with the whirl on it..... ;p<br />
<br />
pretty much everything has been said, DA / HS can help positioning the nameds too...</div></div><hr />
