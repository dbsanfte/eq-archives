<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Greiver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, I decided to start my warrior back up. I got some help from a friend and got a set of cultural armor made real cheap (still working on helm) and bought some new weapons. Since I'm alittle low in the str/sta department, I was wondering if you guys could give some advice on what to get that wont cost me an arm and a leg (5 or 10k a slot, can prolly go higher for haste). Don't really want to replace the cultural armor as it helps me a ton with AC, and the clicky effects are nice. If I could camp anything istead of buying it that would be cool, as my main is a 65 nec. Any help would be greatly appriciated. Here is my magelo: http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=161087</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Clattering bone necklace<br />
Earring of the Solstice<br />
Jagged Bone Hoop<br />
Idol of the Thorned if you don't mind switching it out with your bow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Rings - Get 2x Valorium rings of Gallantry to replace the velium fire wedding rings, the extra stamina should give you more HPs even with reduced stats at lvl 50.<br />
<br />
Waist - Go for either a Soulscream belt (might be able to camp this one in Veksar) or a Rune Branded Girdle to replace your FBSS<br />
<br />
Ranged - Get either a Nightmare Wood Compound bow, Darkwood bow of suffering or a bone carved short bow for the ranged slot.  If you can handle not having a bow there an Idol of the Thorned is another cheap option with good AC and stats.<br />
<br />
Neck - A clattering bone necklace (rare but campable from the grey), a dragon tooth choker or a mithril studded something from Veksar<br />
<br />
Helmet - Helm of the Raldukan is a decent helm for hps/sta/ac.  Buy an armour dye with it so you dont have to have a pink hat (unless you want to have a pink hat ofcourse)<br />
<br />
Earrings - Cheap: the 2ac 35hp black sapphire JC'd earrings, Vah Shir Claw earring.  Medium Price: Spiderfang earring, electrified earring of the tempest, blood earring of rage.  Expensive: Mosquito leg earrings or Blood metal earring of Engagement.<br />
