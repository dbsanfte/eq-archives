<br />
Posted about what weapons to use and some one suggested a played made Ykesh. I assume he meant a troll converted one. It so happens that I am a trol, with a blacksmiting skill at about 190. This means that I can make the worked weapon alright but am a long way of to finish it.<br />
<br />
My question is this: if I combine the worked weapon, the bile temper, file and chisel (and perhaps an imbude jade as I am a RZ worshipper) and FAIL. What happens to the worked weapon, will I still have it to try again on, or is it gone and I have to make another one?<br />
<br />
Please answer asp<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ggak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I know the recipe, thats not the trubble. What I want to know is what happends to the worked ykesh if ifail on making the vengeful ykesh.<br />
<br />
Will I still have the worked ykesh to try again or is it consumed on a failure??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Septikk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Consumed in the failure - I hired a smith to try 5 attempts, he failed on 3 and the honed ykeshas were lost.<br />

<br />
This go for anyone out there too, if you need or want a Honed Blade of the Ykesha, an you are on the Cazic Thule server, look me up and I'll get Slashim to log on and make you one.  I'll see what he's charging too.<br />
<br />
Or, if Slashim is on, send him a tell, but he's NEVER on.</div></div><hr />
