STAND DOWN has been POSTPONED till Tuesday, December 2nd<br />
<br />
I've watched the Poll (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=4313) closely, spoken with many Warriors and friends and have ultimately decided to postpone STAND DOWN.  When I proposed and organized STAND DOWN we had received nothing from SOE for a very long time.  We were all desperate to be noticed, to be heard.  My friends we were successful without even staging our STAND DOWN.  My heartfelt thanks to the Warriors who spent time educating, argueing and championing our cause online over the last week.  <br />
<br />
Join me on the 24th for SOE's online chat discussing their upcoming Melee changes.  It's important that we have a strong Warrior turnout, they are giving us a chance to be heard.  We'll not squander it.  Then, once the chatting has finished, lets discuss what we've heard and decide if STAND DOWN is still necessary.  If so, we do so on Tuesday the 2nd of December.<br />
<br />
Yours in Arms!<br />
- Darkoan  <br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Fellow Warriors,<br />
I know that I'm no formal leader of the Warrior community.  I'd love to see someone like Furor or Brutul take this up, but still I can't stand by and watch this anymore without taking action!<br />
<br />
After years of watching us erode into what we are now.  Years of seeing the parses, the breakdowns, the explanations of how sad balance and particularly our class has become.  Here's where I personally am at on this:<br />
<br />
I'm willing to be banned to make a statement! <br />
<br />
If you are as upset about our situation as I am, then lets do this:<br />
<br />
On Tuesday, December the 2nd, beginning at 9AM (EST) lasting until 9PM (EST) Warriors of all levels will stage a STAND DOWN at or around the Plane of Tranquility stone in the Plane of Knowledge on all Servers.  <br />
- We will bag our weapons, save for Warrior Epic (a ceremonial weapon of decoration).  If you have the Jagged Blade of War, please wield it for this event.<br />
- We will /join serverwide.standdown:warrior<br />
- We will /feedback, /bug and /afk the same message: &quot;I am a Warrior/Monk/Rogue.  Hear my plea.  I demand a statement be issued concerning Melee balancing!  Until then, I will stand here and wait.&quot;<br />
- We will /lfg using the LFG window to use the message text of: Standing Down<br />
- We will periodically notify the zone of our purpose using Shout or OOC, but will ignore hecklers globally addressing them via /tell or in channel only.  <br />
** Recommended SHOUT text: &quot;Today we  STAND DOWN in defiance of the pure melee class imbalance that exists, and has existed, in Norrath.  May Rallos strengthen our plea to the Gods!&quot;  <br />
** Recommended OOC text: &quot;PURE MELEE STAND DOWN!  serverwide.standdown:warrior! BALANCE THE CLASSES!&quot;<br />
- We will allow access to the Tranq stone (if we don't SOE staff will remove us from the zone and possibly from the game)<br />
- Any GM communication that originates should be directed toward serverwide.standdown:warrior which will be moderated by leaders of the Warrior community.<br />
<br />
* STANDING DOWN previous to the event on the 2nd *<br />
A surprising number of us are already STANDING DOWN.  If you don't want to wait for the 18th and wish to show support starting NOW here are the variations upon instructions above:<br />
- We will /AFK the same message: &quot;PURE MELEE STAND DOWN! serverwide.standdown:warrior! BALANCE THE CLASSES! goto www.thesteelwarrior.org to sign up!&quot;<br />
- We will periodically notify the zone of our purpose using Shout or OOC, but will ignore hecklers globally addressing them via /tell or in channel only.  <br />
** Recommended SHOUT text: &quot;The time is coming, soon few will become many.  The Gods can ignore our call for only so long.  The STAND DOWN approaches...&quot;  <br />
** Recommended OOC text: &quot;PURE MELEE STAND DOWN!  serverwide.standdown:warrior! BALANCE THE CLASSES!  goto www.thesteelwarrior.org to sign up!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
What are we after?:<br />
- Acknowledgment of the existence of a pure Melee class imbalance.  <br />
- Clear statement that the imbalance will be corrected, with a best guess of timeline.<br />
- The acknowledgement and statement(s) must be posted in the following locations (offhanded remarks by Absor or fan faire GMs have not and will not generate results!):<br />
EQLive - Upcoming Updates (http://eqlive.station.sony.com/updates/upcoming_updates.jsp) <br />
EQLive - Future Plans (http://eqlive.station.sony.com/updates/future_plans.jsp)<br />
<br />
What is wrong with pure Melee classes? What do you suggest be done?:<br />
- For Monk and Rogue concerns, please visit their forums to discern their imbalances:<br />
EQMonks (http://pub58.ezboard.com/feqmonks73983frm1.showMessage?topicID=28.topic) and Monkly Business (http://pub147.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm1.showMessage?topicID=42323.topic)  for Monks<br />
the Safehouse (http://pub146.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm30.showMessage?topicID=189.topic) for Rogues<br />
- As for Warriors, we have many items of concern.  Most recently a prime example of our problems are most easily summed up by the &quot;Who needs Warriors anyway?&quot; chronicles being conducted by the Arch Overseers guild (http://www.archoverseers.org/), wherein they've used Knights to successfully tank Quarm, RallosB, Bertox.  All end game encounters previously thought to be War tankable only.  Anything a Knight can successfully tank, they immediately become the preferred tank because of the reliability of their Aggro generation.  We obviously are the 3rd or 4th preferred Exp grouping tank.  Now we are becoming the 3rd preferred Raid tank.  We have zero utility, we are the Tanking parent class, supposedly the undisputed Best Tank in the game.  Itemization and boosts to Knights have brought them within a couple hundred HP of us, and equal or greater AC (Innate HP gap between Wars and Knights (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=4020)).  So what really is our advantage (Advantage? (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=4034))?<br />
- The mission of this STAND DOWN is not to make precise demands, mainly to boost knowledge and awareness of the Melee class imbalance and motivate SOE to address the problem.  However, many suggestions have been made within the following threads and all over the Steelwarrior forums: <br />
BrainStorm (post ideas here) (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=2577) <br />
How I'd fix warriors (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=4153) <br />
What are the goals of the STAND DOWN? (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=4174) <br />
Ideas to improve the Warrior class (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=4142) <br />
<br />
<br />
If you don't want to use your Main, then create a newbie Warrior to do the STAND DOWN.  If your friends want to join the cause, encourage them to also create a newbie Warrior.  Use all your accounts, turn-out is important for this to work!<br />
<br />
If you are in support and will join the cause, please respond and help us spread the word! <br />
<br />
Various EQ News sites will be notified of the STAND DOWN on Friday the 14th.<br />
<br />
<br />
**edit 11.07.03 - Shikarii**<br />
Chat Channel set to serverwide.standdown:warrior .. Admin is set plus mods will be added. It will be strictly moderated to keep relevance with this thread's motion for group action.<br />
<br />
**update 11.09.03 - Darkoan**<br />
The STAND DOWN has already begun.  If you want to begin standing down on your servers, do it!  The /petition portion will be saved for the 18th, but match the AFK message listed here.  One voice, One mission.  Darkoan is now a fixture in the Plane of Knowledge.<br />
<br />
**update 11.10.03 - Darkoan**<br />
Due to overwhelming request /petition has been removed from the action items.  It was never our intent to flood petition queues and possibly cause harm to other players.  Also, made it a bit more clear what we are after with our STAND DOWN.  Miscellaneous changes.<br />
<br />
**update 11.12.03 - Darkoan**<br />
Added ZhaoVizier's idea to use message text in LFG window.  Clarified many things.  Added a PRE-EVENT section.  Added statement urgeing players be allowed access to Tranq stone, as SOE has shown a resolve in this area.<br />
<br />
**update 11.15.03 - Darkoan**<br />
Following the information posted on EQVault we are strongly considering Postponing STAND DOWN till after the online chat with SOE on the 24th.  Please everyone vote using the link provided at the top of the post.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>corillis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">hey, crashing PoK sounds like a nice idea... count me in</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>taenk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">As far as I'm concerned, civil disobedience is the only option left.  Count me in.  If this doesn't get their attention, then even more extreme measures are fine with me.  I'm tired of SoE and tired of their silence.  Polite obviously doesn't work, so maybe rude will.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Antaran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well waiting around isnt getting us anywhere so I'm in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aveen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Why Tuesday the 18th?<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm not opposed to this course of action. However, I don't see what it will gain us besides warnings for disruptions. Technically we can't be warned if all were doing is standing around. However, when a GM comes on because people are complaining, is he/she will start kicking people from the game or summoning them elsewhere and the leaders may get a temporary suspension for intentionally causing zone disruption. That is the possible consequences of this action if we follow it through.<br />
<br />
So we have to ask ourselves, will it get us anywhere? Well it could. But only if we also threaten to all cancell our accounts (even if for only a half an hour, SOE will see the cancellations en mass) at the same exact time should we not get the response we hope for. Money talks and bullshit walks, and I think money is the only way to get our message across to SOE. <br />
<br />
Also understand, that if we go this route, it is our last stand. SOE/VI will either listen and respond at this point or they wont. If they don't, they never will. And we are more likley to get the GM response of getting kicked offline instead of an actuall response. <br />
<br />
Does it matter? Will it change anything? NO<br />
If by some miracle the dev's decide to address us, changes wont be forthcomming.  Paladins will still be able to tank everything in the game and be prefered for it now. We MIGHT (as in MAYBE) get looked into before the end of the year. But it isn't likely.  <br />
<br />
I say go ahead and advertise this on every single message board, in every single forum you can. Email it (not just submitting it to the Dev corner) to every public EQ/SOE/VI Email address you can find. Let them know EXACTLY what we want, and EXACTLY what we will do if we don't get it. <br />
<br />
I may be beaten, but damnit I'm not dead yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Darkoan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Threats haven't gotten us anywhere.  If we are at the point of actually cancelling our accounts, what is the difference if we are banned?<br />
<br />
This is an interactive game, we can effect our environment in this game.  So why shouldn't we?  50+ warriors all congregated for 12 hours in one place on every Server all with the same AFK message will make noise, it will get people talking.  Posting this to EQ News sites will get more people to do it, more people talking.  THEY CANNOT IGNORE THIS<br />
<br />
If they do nothing, we do it again, and again.  If they want to cancel accounts over this, they can start with me, I have 3 accounts.  Bring it on SOE!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Darkoan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">As to the question on &quot;Why the 18th?&quot;.  I just picked a lower count day so that we aren't affecting things as terribly as we would on Fri, Sat, Sun.  The 18th is far enough out for us to get a feel of support on this topic and still get warning out on the 14th to the News sites.<br />
<br />
Optimally everyone will login their Warrior toon, place him at the Tranq stone in PoK, set petition and afk messages and head off to work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tharak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I am not thoroughly convinced this will accomplish anything, i guess it would at least draw more attention to the problem than there is now.  I would think all the efforts of the guild AO are drawing far more attention than a sit in would draw.  I mean they are basically trivializing PoP endgame content in an effort to prove how obsolete SoE has made warriors.  They can ban or kick us during a sit in, but are they really going to kick a guild because they killed Quarm with a &lt;&lt;insert class here&gt;&gt;, and i believe they cannot exactly ignore that their uber content is getting raped as we speak; while everyone laughs at Absor's lame &quot;classes are not that out of balance&quot; retoric.<br />
<br />
     I think I will attend, though by the time i log in on PST things will clearly already be done.  I do however, doubt anything interesting will come of it.  I think it would be more effective to also have more than just warriors showing up at any rally to support our cause.  SoE is more than likly of the opinion that it's just warriors whining, get a few more classes involved and maybe they will take notice; probably not though.  The only other thing I think they would notice is everyone /quit their accounts, or maybe if no warriors logged in for a day (or a week).  Seems like if we left the game as it is now, it wouldn;t matter much anyway.<br />
<br />
  What is the release date of WoW again? . . .  well i can hope can;t I?!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Eh, might be fun.  I'll even get on the Warrior whos name you see on the left.<br />
<br />
Pretty sad when you find out making a character of the main tanking class means you really won't be able to tank any better than the SK you already have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'd recommend you at least linking this on paladin and sk boards.<br />
<br />
They might not want nerfed, but generally they do believe we need looked at. I wouldnt be surprised if you found some more people to help you out there.</div></div><hr />

I suggest emailing all these addresses, and link them to the steelwarriors.  I will try to find again Absor's email address (though I think it is absor@soe.sony.com ) as well as the higher ups email addresses. It would be ironic if you could submit this to EQNews on the EQLive site. <br />
<br />
I'll be there, I may be truely afk but i will read my logs after.</div></div><hr />

______________________<br />
<br />
I'd add that unless something like that happens likely the event will be ignored by SoE for the most part.  If the only one complaining about gimped warriors is well warriors . . . . then all we have to look forward to is the warrior fix coming later next year . . . . .<br />

I've spoken to Frod, one of the figureheads on these boards. We're trying to get in touch with some of the figureheads from the monk and rogue boards, because while it may seem like it, all melees are hurting, not just us. We're trying to find common ground and make one large proposition for general AND class-specific fixes for all three melee classes, and following such ideas with civil disobediance if necessary. <br />
<br />
You can try this now, but the only way you'll get something really accomplished is with large backing. Therefore, let's get all the melees on one consolidated idea, and get a large number of supporters before going through with this.</div></div><hr />

You don't take issue with the fact that the RZ had lower dps vs. the knight than the non-def warrior?<br />
<br />
RZ DPS: 2272 on tana (non-def war)<br />
RZ DPS: 2202 on nomi (pal)<br />
<br />
Nomi 11 shielding vs. Tana 7 shielding<br />
Tana 10% avoidance vs. Nomi 0 avoidance<br />
(the avoidance would more than compensate for 4 shielding)<br />

If &quot;zone disruption&quot; or mass petitioning can be made the issue, then your actual protest can simply be ignored (again).<br />
<br />
- Yes, go on strike; there are multiple places available to do so, not just PoK. The wider you spread your &quot;visible&quot; protest, the more people you make aware of it. If &quot;standing down&quot; occurs in starting cities, PoTranquility, and other places where you can safely stand idle, as well as PoK, you're less likely to be sanctioned for zone disruption, and you're more likely to be seen by more people.<br />
<br />
- Consider one petition per server, not hundreds. Ticked off devs are much less likely to be reasonable than non-ticked off devs.<br />
<br />
- Do your best to enlist all tank-class characters in this, not just warriors. The fewer tanks available to do anything, the more likely it is that your protest will have an effect.<br />

I know my character is gimp and useless compared to an SK or Pally, but I will be in the stand down even though I cant even begin to understand the frustrations of the more seasoned warriors.<br />
<br />
<br />
An idea may be to have a link to a website like... www.warriors-need-fixing-now.com where the main page discusses everything the community feels is wrong with warriors. Contains a link to the site that shows an SK and pally tanked Quarm and details all the ideas we have for fixes, or at least clearly outlines the problems.<br />
<br />
I think if every warrior puts that link in their afk message, many EQers will go and read, possibly some devs, and you may get a statement on that. I would also like the note that while im a newb warrior, I am a seasoned Monk, and we are in the same boat for suckage, perhaps this should be the three melees together.</div></div><hr />

I am fully aware that the Warrior as class has issues that needs to be addressed. I do however not always agree in the way that some of the posters on this board would like your class improved.<br />
As I am sure there are differencies in perception within your class itself too.<br />
<br />
Nor do I fully agree with the way you are doing this. That being said, does not mean I do not understand the level of frustration you have reached (yes... I did play a ranger during the Kunark era. I do know what it is like for a class you care for to have severe issues to deal with).<br />

What is it you stand together about?<br />
I might be somewhat dense but you want to make this Stand Down in order to get, quote: &quot;a statement be issued concerning Melee balancing.&quot;?<br />

But I also realize that when you run a company you cannot make a promise about your product to the consumers before you actually have a sample of your product, unless you aim to undermine your professional integrity.<br />
<br />
It has been seen before. If Absor did issue a statement i.e. about warrior mitigration needing a noticable boost to be visually better than knight mitigration (I personally would like such an upgrade to the warrior) and it turns out that this for one reason or other is not remotely possible within the limits of EQ, I am sure alot of ppl would be in Absor's throat for taking something away that was never there. I can fully understand why Absor is holding his cards close to himself currently.<br />
And I am pretty sure alot of you can too.<br />
<br />
Above being said does however not mean that I do not think that SOE couldnt have handled this better.<br />
More communication (even if nonspecific) would always help to ease down some of the speculations, I guess.<br />
<br />
I doubt the task at hand for SOE is easy. I really do realize it must be somewhat of a challenge. Thus I also realize that SOE would be better off taking their time instead of jumping the gun too fast. We saw what happened when they did that in the past. I guess SOE learned from that experience and is addressing balacing matters more professionally now but also with more caution.<br />
<br />
I think it would become the warriors well if you for one moment tried to put your frustration aside (yeah.. not saying it should be easy.... I do feel with you guys), stepped back a tad and tried to look at this from above.<br />
Think above any suggestion you would have to improve your class. What would the severe implement be for that improvement to all other classes and EQ as whole?<br />
Finding the right solution is by no means easy. Please try and acknowledge that and give SOE some credit for not wishing to undermine their own income by pissing off their costumers.<br />
<br />
Zonedisruptions will not get you increased positive attention. I can assure you that. Its promised it will be addressed in specifics at the end of this month. I fail to see why that is not good enough. Do you seriously think that you guys disrupting your fellow gamers will improve your public image or the speed in which this is being addressed? I hardly think so.<br />
However... if SOE fail to comply late November, I would say you had a good reason to react. How that reaction should be issued is a whole other matter :D.<br />
<br />
I wish the best of luck to you warriors and truely hope SOE will dish up something you will be happy with.</div></div><hr />

It's the lack of progress, or indeed, any indication that progress is being made, despite months of waiting. <br />
<br />
It cannot be that the development team is simply unaware of the problem:<br />
We've said it. We've been saying it. We know there is an issue, we're working on fixing it, we'll let you know what we plan when we have those ideas clearly outlined and looked into.<br />
 <br />
The above quote indicates otherwise. It cannot be that &quot;there hasn't been time to do anything about it&quot; - there's obviously been plenty of time to continue to improve caster/hybrid utility, add zones and expansions, correct typographical errors, fiddle with the user interface, simplify the newbie player experience, and any number of other things over the several months that melee balance issue has been &quot;being looked into&quot;.<br />
<br />
I don't expect melee balance and itemization to be auto-magicallly fixed in 12 hours; I don't expect (or want) casters and hybrids to be nerfed somehow; I don't expect the developers to implement any or all of the suggestions posted on dozens of forums; I do expect (and want) that this issue be considered more important to address than, say, exciting new sparkly blue rings around the mob I have on target or a half-finished zone that has no apparent purpose yet. <br />
<br />
I work in software development, and believe me when I say that I don't want ill-considered changes implemented without due consideration  of the long term consequences (KEI, anyone?). I'd just like a little more than &quot;We'll do... something... about it. Real Soon Now.&quot; as a response to the ever-growing and obvious disparity between pure-melee and other classes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I mean Absor could easily tell us &quot;we started discussion of melee balancing on the 4th February 2003. Since then we have been discussing issue such as dps, mitigation, aggro, utility, etc.! We haven't come up with a complete set of potential fixes, but we are working hard to have a list of issue that will be addressed. We are not saying that pure melee will get a boost in all those aspect of the game, but we are definetely evaluating some potential fixes that will touch to one or few of those said issues.&quot;<br />
<br />
Absor is the company spokesman, and he can't even come up with a 1 page statement of any sort, 10 months after they started planning this... We are not asking he give us a detailed plan of what the fix will be, but he could at least discuss what they been doing for the past 10 months. They must have a grid of some sort that is used to compare class in order to keep the balance.  It doens't mean they gonna patch the pure melee in all those aspects, it just mean they have evaluted the situation regarding pure melee in those aspects.<br />
<br />
Instead of telling us something like that, he give us the exact same cut and paste statement he has been for the past 4 to 10 months. He is the company spokesman, and he can't even do better than 2 sentence statement....<br />
<br />
So far the only thing we know, is that they consider pure melee dps subpar to caster dps....  well it's only 1 aspect of our problem, we don't even know if they have looked at our other problems based on aggro, mitigation, utility, etc... IT'S ABOUT TIME THEY TELL US WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN EVALUATING.<br />
<br />
Anyone with half a brain that has some basic knowledge of project management and customer support would know that if the only thing you bring to the table after 10 months is a big &quot;Hold on tight, these things take times, we will have a statement soon&quot; would know it would be immediate reason to get fired.<br />
<br />
<br />
At the basic minimum in a 10 month period, the developer should have reevaluated class description, can they at least tell us if Warrior are still suppose to be the king of tanking, or if they plan on having the tanking of boss mob be interchangeable among all the 3 tank class in the game...  Absor, can you give us an updated class description page? Knowing that knights are planned to be interchangeable with warrior for everything tanking, would solve a lot of problems.<br />
<br />
What was the reaction of SoE in regards to a paladin and SK tanking quarm and the other phase 5 gods? Is it considered to be a problem or it's something they have planned and are happy about?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u125"><b>Feare2002</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p125">I posted this on the monk forums a while ago. Some thoughts and suggestions on this &quot;Stand Down&quot; action.<br />
-----------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Show up, talk to your friends and guildies. Explain what you are doing. Stand in a visible area but not in the way of people trying to get to the port stones. Don't block any merchants, banks or doorways (easy to do with an Ogre or Troll). Avoid getting into /shout or /ooc slanging matches with people trying to bait you. Do not spam public channels concerning the &quot;Stand down&quot;. If a GM or a guide appears in the /who listing, DO NOT harass him/her with tells about the &quot;stand down&quot;. Remember, the GM or guide is going to be an important feedback method to the devs and its best to present a good mature impression on them. <br />
<br />
Do not give an &quot;easy out&quot; for SOE to dismiss your cause out of hand by behaving badly. This means that you need to be respectul and polite in putting your point accross. Do not be obnoxious or use an insulting tone when describing SOE in ANY public channels that can be easily monitored (including /say, /gu, /g or /1 (channel talk). I DO NOT recommend clogging the petition queue with the &quot;Stand down&quot; complaint. This will alienate both the general populace that might need GM/Guide help and the average guide/GM that has to respond to them. I personally think we ought just to use /bug or /feedback and NOT /petition.<br />
<br />
Will this work? I think, it will give some devs and other players (who dont frequent class forums) an indication that there is REALLY a big section of the player population that are unhappy over the present class imbalance. I personally think that Absor (and others) is mispresenting the true picture of (melee) player unhappiness to SOE management (&quot;Classes are not that out of balance&quot; statement). This might put a spike up their a** I guess with such a public display of player discontent coming at the heels of the release of FFXI and other future impending MMOGs.<br />
<br />
PS: I think this is a GREAT idea. Bad publicity (for SOE as a gaming company) is your friend and the &quot;stand down&quot; timing is perfect - sandwiched between FFXI's release and Horizons upcoming debut. Nothing worse (for SOE) than to have tales of player discontent at the moment when their rivals are itching to steal the community (and any future customers). It worked for the Clerics, remember the spate of BBC tech stories on their epic? RF was changed soon after from a 6 day camp to a triggered spawn. Something that would have never happened without bad publicity on SOE.</div></div><hr />

Pherrit, in case you hadn't noticed this issue is MUCH more involved in class balance and etc than a simple spell fix. Ultimately the decision has to be the developers, they have the actual data on how everything works and how any changes might or might not be possible to implement. <br />
<br />
We can provide various options for them to peruse for useful idea's and even a casual inspection of the other stickied thread let alone the rest of the forum will show that we have done so, but it would be stupid for us to try to dictate the actual solution without the full facts and without knowledge of the direction SoE wishes to push balance.<br />

Though i'm mainly a cleric, my main alt is a warrior.<br />
And in response to some of those people that keep on writing what is it we want fixed... well we want fixed that either we are the MAIN tank, so we can tank better than the two other tanks, or they come out and say what our new role definition is.<br />
<br />
Because as it is now, a pally and SK are just as good tanks as warriors are. And they have spells, which means less downtime and more utility for them...<br />
<br />
so what does that leave us?<br />
<br />
SO STAND DOWN!!!!!</div></div><hr />

I would think the best thing to do would be get as many people as you can to /feedback about the problem. Every day.<br />
<br />
I'm sure Sony would get pretty tired of getting a lot of feedback about the warrior problem every single day. It would be a lot more effective than sending in a petition so a Guide or whoever can just delete it, and standing around by the PoT stone getting ignored by everyone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because first, GM's are closely linked (in some way) with the higher brass. They have to give reports of their daily occurances and what have you.<br />
<br />
Secondly, I know of several people that put in multiple feedbacks per day regarding the melee balancing issues. None of the get replies, none of them get answers. <br />

We want answers, we've been waiting for it for almost a year now while the upper brass of SoE has been jacking off and fixing doors in freeport.<br />

He hasn't done or said anything to deserve the community's respect or a stand down of the Stand Down...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u163"><b>pherrit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p163">valeris, you just made my point very well. you said it. <br />
<br />
Ultimately the decision has to be the developers, they have the actual data on how everything works and how any changes might or might not be possible to implement<br />
<br />
but it would be stupid for us to try to dictate the actual solution without the full facts and without knowledge of the direction SoE wishes to push balance.<br />
<br />
with that in mind why bother doing this stand down? it wont make a difference. like i said before i have an inside track. if people tell me what they want, from balance i can present it to my good friend in product developement and see what he can do. if you crash a zone with no ideas what you would like to see changed then you are standing in quick sand. stand all ya want and you will get no where. that is even if they respond to your actions with anything other than killing your accounts. but hey if you are all that set on getting kicked out of the game or suspendid, then why not just quit the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u164"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p164">In your mind perhaps.<br />
<br />
The stand down is protesting the lack of any indication that this issue has been discussed, the lack of feedback to the community, the way in which SoE has treated (ignored) their pure melee customers. And sitting quietly by did what exactly - they've taken NEARLY A YEAR to even aknowledge this issue,  they deserve this show of displeasure and if it REALLY focuses their attention, so much the better.<br />
<br />
You have an inside track do you? I don't know you from adam, why should I trust you, even considering that I'm not much impressed by the clarity of your posting.<br />
<br />
We're the customers, we can protest the lack of a fix and demand that the games makers provide one BECAUSE IT'S THEIR JOB. Difficult concept?<br />
<br />
We've tried to help, we've offered plenty of ideas over time to a total blanket silence - if Sony showed slightly more interest in engaging with this community this protest would never have come to pass, excuse your friend all you want, SoE dropped the ball big time, they're reaping the embarrassment that they sowed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u165"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p165">Oh and frankly, if SoE decided to Ban everyone, they'd have a public relations disaster an order of magnitude worse than the current one on their hands I reckon. I'm so bloody frustrated that if they choose to ban me they're probably doing me a favour - I don't really know why I haven't cancelled my account already.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u166"><b>Goladus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p166">I doubt they'll ban people.  But I also really doubt this wil accomplish anything.<br />
<br />
I don't think they'd really have any trouble breaking this up if they wanted to, without doing anything about melee balance.  Heck one person shouting 'Lodizal is up' would probably draw a few people away.  If they did a full &quot;goodie&quot; patch with all sorts of new things to go try out?  I don't think you really have enough hardcore people on each server willing to sacrifice their playtime just to strongarm Verant into doing something.<br />
<br />
Even assuming you could gather the support you'd need to do something like this.. you'd need a good 30 people per server at least, for 50 servers that's a minimum of 1500 people you'll need to be online at the same time.  Even assuming you could harass other players to the point that it would be a real problem for the GMs and guides, what would you hope to accomplish by this?  They've said repeatedly that they know there is an issue.  It's not like you're going to be &quot;opening their eyes&quot; to the problem or anything.  All it is is a form of bullying.  You guys want something, and are going to try to force them in to giving it to you.  Since when does that ever generate good results?  At best it will lead to hasty, half-baked decisions and most likely it won't do anything.  Well, other than waste a lot of time that the pallies are going to spend working towards better hitpoint augments.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u174"><b>auladian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p174">well just wanted to add my 2 cents about this after reading 10 pages worth of what seemed interesting to say the least.<br />
<br />
for the record im not a warrior im a ranger /shrug<br />
<br />
anyhow first and foremost i think the warrior issue is different from the melee class issue in general and should be addressed seperately..<br />
<br />
warriors are correct, ill be the first to admit that when im putting together a group.. or hell even getting called to a group.. i look for/hope the tank is a pally or sk.<br />
<br />
with warriors the shaman or enchanter is always getting smacked.. cleric is always going lom its a mess so i think the only addressing warriors need is a way to keep better aggro.  eb helps but taunt is a pos.. and what happens for the warriors who dont have access to those kind of weapons.  i think taunt should be adjusted but cant be made overpowering..<br />
<br />
as far as balancing melee vs caster.. this one pissed me off for awhile until i sat down to think for a 1/2 second and realized its an ignorant arguement.   we want our dps bumped up to match caster dps..... so what happens when casters want their hp's or ac moved up to match our defensive abilities ? <br />
<br />
its invalid.. just like some warriors want healing and such.. well thats gay imo because thats what defines / seperates the classes... if we all had eachothers abilities / skills .. it would make the game ridiculous...<br />
<br />
anyhow im just rambling now.. i wish iw asnt retired so i could log on and see this on prexus though..<br />
<br />
good luck guys =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u175"><b>Tamerlane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p175">i think more of a warrior increase in mitigation/evasion and HP differences is the problem.  I dont have a problem with paladins and SKs having snap aggro besides it dumbing down the game.   The thing is we gave up all those spells and other utilities because we wanted to tank.  We should be the only tank specialists.  I pretty much think our aggro is fine.  If we had snap aggro then this game would be even more easier.  However as the Tank class specialty and parent class...there is no reason we shouldnt have significant more HPs and a significant amount of mitigation evasion where it would make a difference. <br />
<br />
I personally see that as the only way to balance warriors without screwing things up for other classes as well.  Knights have snap agro and can tank...but a warrior should have mitigation, evasion, and hit point differences whereas he would at least be see of as on par with the hybrid for tanking.<br />

Knight has $$ aggro but ok mitigation/HP/Evasion<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u176"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p176">Instead of petitions, you should /feedback.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u177"><b>GabeSongsopain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p177">I have played every class of character there is, and i agree with everything you are saying. Couple of things though, you might want to consider. You will be in the game, you have already paid for your time, and as long as you aren't causing disruptions, all that will answer petitions mostly will be apprentice guides and guides, and maybe the occasional GM, but most likely not one of the GMs who have the power to affect what you are wanting. I used to be a guide over on the Tribunal server. <br />
<br />
If you just complain in a petition nothing much will happen. If you do nothing, no raiding, no groups, or soloing, no nothing, it matters not to SOE, because you paid, you are in the game, for them, who cares. These people are filthy rich because of us. Warriors alone won't do anything. Get all the classes. Post on more than just this board, post every guild site you can gain access to post on, where they will allow you to post. Though I say gain permission to post something like this first. Make sure people that are not guilded know about this. Get those also that don't come to these boards. You are allowed to say things in /shout or /ooc, just be careful how you phrase it. Using an alternate account with something not your main or same account, just not using your main? If they choose to ban you they ban not the main, but all on the account.<br />
<br />
I believe to make it count, you gotta use your main, or at least your account. I would say main. Makes a better statement, shows you are serious. Hell, do the stand in, or whatever, but if it don't work, everyone stay offline for a week, or two. If you addicts can handle the withdrawls. :)  Then, just cancel the account or something. Losing everything, from a shitload of players all at once, will make anyone stand up and say, &quot;WTF!?&quot; Nothing like losing money within a big corporation to make them smile big fake smiles, and negotiate. Hey, whatever. If I am able to return by this time, if you don't want a warrior, then I won't do it. If you are happy to have a bard stand up and do it with you, then I will join you. I won't make a warrior character. I'd be willing to risk my main, and pride and joy to make SOE make the changes needed. It ain't just warriors that need the change. :) /em shrugs<br />
<br />
If I cannot be there, I will definitely have one of my friends create a character on one of their extra accounts and stand as well.<br />

Im a bard.. and usually a puller and I think its rediculous the equipment, proc, augs, AAs or w/e warriors need ot pull aggro over SK/Pallies when Warriors should be able to pull aggro faster than anyone. This is only a small detail.. but an important one at the same time.. Taunt should be upgraded! Warriors are meant to tank!<br />
<br />
A friend of mine (a war) told me about someone who made 2 magelo profiles.. 1 pally 1 warrior.. both with all AAs and best gear etc... and the pally had just about the SAME hps.. what the FUCK is that? Warriors were put here for a purpose and SoE is taking it away from them by boosting SKs and Pallies while forgetting about you all..<br />
I will be standing down with all of you. I know there will be many other calsses who will also.. as many of us know how shitty it is to be nerfed or forgotten when the hand outs come around...<br />

Frst however we should consider .. &quot;how do you grab the guy that can make stuff happen atention ..is this really going to do the job or waste our collective time .. and do enough people know about this ... because first of all i would question enough realise the drpravity of the pure melee namely warriors because we are he second most important class in the game next to monk and the foremost reason this needs to be adressed and also monks who suffer from the im pretty useless problem.<br />
<br />
A. It needs to be clear in our sit out .. that we need to have a goal .. Such as we are protesting because we not only have the leats utility in the game but we have the hardest job and least ability to reward ourselves. This isn't a fight for lack of DPS its a fight for lack of purpose of playing the warrior class endless hours to have to sit in the backseat while driving in the front.<br />
<br />
B. we are not the only ones that feel this way, every single informed player be it mage, bard whatever AGREES with this statement. this isn't just our fight, its everyones. The problem of aggro weapon desparity and lack of ability to enjoy the fruits of the game are seriously broken for our class . And many of us can say this like myself who have played this game for 4+ years .<br />
<br />
C. We are not whining we are protecting our time investment, be it vanity to do so we are simply frustrated with the time it takes to develope a warrior and the plethra of extra guild focus to outfit warriors in order to keep not the balance of classes equal but the value of playing the critical class of a warrior to any guild as fruitful as well as ENJOYABLE to continue the continuity of endgame funtion and general lifespan of EQ endeavors to play.<br />
<br />
D. We should not all have our participation level and enjoyment level based on a single warriors ability to prosper (fuhror) and all those in afterlife or fires of heaven which we the players suspect is the basis for all SOE's decisions upon how to deal (or not deal) with the depravity a warrior class player faces. The choice of SOE to not address there warrior class players or even to address the warrior class players problems is a failure to consider how the endgame functions practically at all except for a few very top notch guilds.<br />
<br />
Now having said that .. those of us that are serious about this and agree with these statements please attend the 18th sit out.<br />
A failure to participate is a choice in itself.<br />

Not like this happens everyday 8). I know many of the PC magazins have at least 1 writer with an active account so they can participate. Just should be made clear to them that we dont want to point out VI or Everquest as the pure evil. We love this game or why u still play? <br />
All we want is that some more work is put in that class balancing issues even if it means you have to take devs from their work on the next expansion.<br />

Of course this means a later release of the next expansion but it might even out the cash in the end if you dont have frustrated players leaving and not buying VIs next expansion.</div></div><hr />

Gingles, that kind of information is all over the boards here.  If I was going to whittle it down to 25 words or less ... <br />
<br />
Desireability on par with the knight class tanks in XP groups, and a  unique role or roles for the warrior class in raid level  events.<br />
<br />
The details of something as sweeping as the above is much too large to discuss in one forum, which is why it's discussed in several forums here :).  It's all over TSW, you can check out the Class Balancing or The Outhouse boards for more content.  And remember that when you go looking in an outhouse, you should know already what sort of thing to expect ;).<br />
<br />
<br />
As to what the stand down is asking for:<br />

Page 1 of the thread.<br />
<br />
Specifically, the stand down is asking for a statement from SOE, communication with content.  Something more than &quot;It's on the list, honest!&quot;.  It's a demonstration by any of the customer base who want to join, to show that the product is not working to spec, and something must be done about it.  If you think there are significant class balancing issues which are not receiving there due attention, participate.  As for myself, I work at home, and if/when I'm not working at my computer, I'll be there.  While I have no doubt that SOE is working on these issues, I feel that they've let them slide for far too long and they have not done their job at the customer service end.<br />

<br />
Yar, I can.  I am bitter and paranoid enough ;).  But the smarter course is to do nothing if they are against it - direct intervention will only increase ire directed against them.  I anticipate a blanket statement (&quot;We regret our inability to have discussed these issues in the past, and do hope to have something concrete to share with the EverQuest community in the very near future.  Please bear with us, and once again we apologize and understand your frustrations.&quot;).  And quite possibly, that blanket statement would come a few days after the stand down, lest the player base be encouraged to try this sort of thing often.</div></div><hr />

Here's one : &quot;Although the warrior, like any class, may need some tweaking, we feel the warrior class is largely like we intended&quot;. <br />
<br />
Seriously, articulate the issues you have before you do this thing or it is doomed to fail before you start it. A protest without stating your demand is stupid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u222"><b>Thaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p222">Merr, who said that? You or some SOE employee?</div></div><hr />

Absor, I'm sure you know we are planning a sit in/stand down whatever you want to call it. Would you mind responding on that thread? There is alot of anger and frustration here, if you truly have something in the works for us, then we should probably not stage our protest. <br />
<br />
By Absor:<br />
Sorry Darkoan, but I'm certainly not going to encourage behaviour that is disruptive to the gameplay of other players by responding to or about any sit in, except to say that I don't like it when people disrupt the play of others like that. <br />
<br />
By not repsonding Absor is certainly not going to prevent it.  The jist of his message.  Because your being unruly and disrupting gameplay for others, the whole issue is going to be ignored.<br />
Looks to me like this is the &quot;party line&quot; that will be used to ignore this.  Your disrupting the game ect.  We will not respond because to do so encourages this kind of behavior.<br />
<br />
Don't give them this shield to hide behind.<br />
<br />
Many good suggestions have been made so far.   The one that has the most merit, and I think everyone really needs to consider is:<br />
<br />
Don't group up in mass and block access points to anything, be it doorways or zones.<br />
<br />
The intent of this is not to crash zones or disrupt play, but to raise awareness and show support... and hopefully get some answers.  Make your actions reflect this.</div></div><hr />

Namely, boycotting any and all products made by Sony.  If we as a group were to e-mail the parent company stating that we are boycotting all their products because of SOE's lousy customer service then that may get their attention.<br />

Future Plans for October\November, 2003<br />
Those of us behind the scenes here on the EverQuest team have plans for the future of the game. Further Down the Line is where we will keep you informed about what those plans are. Please understand that these are our long-term plans and may require a fair amount of research or development time. <br />
<br />
<br />
Development on the following projects continues. We appreciate your patience as we work out the details.<br />
<br />
Class Balance <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
We're still planning to take a look at improving the damage capabilities of melee classes, as they've fallen behind their magic-using counterparts at the very high end of the game. Finding the proper solutions for this situation will take some time.  Some options being considered are: <br />
<br />
<br />
Improve melee damage-increasing disciplines<br />
Improve Planes of Power melee weapons <br />
<br />
<br />
Additionally, we're looking at the concerns from players about their spells, and changing them where appropriate.  The goal here is to remove annoying issues with spells, not necessarily to increase caster power overall. <br />
<br />
Shields and blocking<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
We're planning on reviewing the possibility of giving an innate chance to block when using a shield. We've been hoping to do this for a while, and it should be getting a realistic review in the near future. We'd like to increase the value of shields, and make it a worthwhile choice for players who might normally dual-wield weapons or use a two-handed weapon. We plan on balancing this against classes which use shields by default, and therefore wouldn't be making any trade-offs to equip a shield.</div></div><hr />

I quit this game 2 yrs ago as a Warrior seeing these issues starting get worse.  It's just not fair to allow other classes to be as good at tanking as we are because it's the one thing we have over them.  We have no magic, no extras, nothing to sweeten the deal.  We give up these things to have a pure warrior as our character.  Since we've sacrificed the convenience of having extras throughout our EQ career, we should be rewarded with characters that are the best for the tanking job.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is less of a demand for specific items so much as a protest against the crappy way in which we the customers have been treated. We should not be 'blackmailing' people and therefore we cannot issue demands but only requests. <br />
<br />
think Gandhi :p<br />
<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
<br />
Things we're specifically seeking.<br />
<br />
A clear, detailed statement of how SoE has been pursuing the melee balance and specific warrior issues up until this point. <br />
<br />
A statement as to what paths SoE are currently pursuing to return things to balance and a solid time frame in which we can expect these issues to be fixed.<br />
<br />
Regular updates would be desireable if there are setbacks, and information for we the customers to grumble and scream about on the boards (since in amongst the chaff they might find a few gems).<br />
<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
As to the event organisation, i'd suggest people set up channels when they log on to their server this week titled... <br />
<br />
standdownservername <br />
<br />
...with the servername being the first word of the server i.e The Rathe would have standdownrathe, Kane bayle would have Standdownkane etc etc. <br />
<br />
Alternatively and if the channels are compromised look for names of people from your server in this thread or on your server board and contact them about setting up an alternate channel. <br />
<br />
Keep that channel up this week so that you get an idea how many people will be attending, when they will be online &amp; wether you wish to recruit others - etc etc. <br />
<br />
If you want to join the serverwide channel go ahead although I would assume it's only required on the day.<br />
<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
As far as the physical reality of the protest i would suggest making yourselves 'inconvenient' enough to be noticed without ruining other peoples gaming experience.<br />
 <br />
As an example, If you're blocking the zone let people pass after asking them to /shout All hail to the Coffeemakers! or some similar silly line which advertises the protests' presence and politely asking them, if they have a spare moment, to send a feedback asking SoE to get melee sorted ASAP. <br />
<br />
If you're going to /AFK try to arrange with the others in your channel so that the zone isn't accidentally blocked.<br />
<br />
/Feedbacking in a block at particular times of the day (as hopefully organised in the serverwide channel) is a better idea than /petitioning, it inconveniences the volunteer guides (your fellow players) and those with a legitimate need for customer service - We all know exactly how hard it is to get that even on a good day ;) <br />
<br />
If you want to shout stuff to the zone or perform other forms of wackiness go for it, but I suggest deciding as a server group what's appropriate :). <br />
<br />
<br />
*******<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Finally, part of the point of this protest is to raise awareness with people who don't frequent the boards or concern themselves with balance issues exactly how upset we are with the way SoE has treated us as a block of paying customers. <br />
<br />
Alienating fellow players is counterproductive to our goals.<br />
<br />
*Edit* Because i suddenly forgot how to use the bold command :p</div></div><hr />

2) Innate EB proc. 700 hate instantly, usable at range, re-use time of about 20-30 seconds.<br />
<br />
Having both ideas implemented also suggested.<br />
<br />
HP edge:<br />
- The HP gap between knights and warriors has become WAY too narrow, especially since Plane of Time Knightmization, paladin buffs, and LDoN augs. Most popular fixes:<br />
1) Innate 5-10% Natural Durability for warriors.<br />
2) Stamina post-255 should work as it did prior to 255, giving warriors 7hp/tick as it should be (since 51-60 was 6hp/tick). <br />
<br />
Implementation of both also suggested <br />
<br />
Damage Mitigation:<br />
- See above in terms of HP gap. See the log parse for Rallos Zek if you are unconvinced. Most popular suggestions:<br />
1) Innate 10% mitigation boost for warriors. That means 10% off DI AND DB. Suggestion to limit this fix to just DI also made<br />
2) Remove /disc defensive altogether, 20-25% Innate mitigation boost (off both DI and DB).<br />
<br />
General Fixes (this area affects ALL pure melees, not just warriors):<br />
- While casters/hybrids received massive benefits between levels 61-65, pure melees received nothing at all. Aside from that, pure melees have been suffering at the hands of game designers since SoL. Suggestions:<br />
1) Skill caps increase: 5-10 points/level all around (offensive, weapon skills, defensive skills) for pure melees only. <br />
2) Stat caps increase (since casters can get up to 355 wiz/int, smilar increases proposed to melee-based stats; Str/Dex/Agi/Sta)<br />
3) Unlinking the timers between discs. Especially between offensive and defensive based disciplines.<br />
<br />

These are the issues. They are not for debate, nor for arguing, so if you're post HERE to argue them, don't. Get owned on another thread. This list is made for the 12,650th time to cease bitches who claim we have no issues to stand on.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u246"><b>Arrt Tillery</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p246">My wife and I will be joining the Stand Down on 18Nov2003.  She will be logging on her warrior, which she abandoned many years ago to play an enchanter, and I will use my wizard.<br />
<br />
The reasoning behind the use of my wizard, as opposed to what an earlier reply stated as a desire to see my paladin, is simple:  As a wizard, I live and die by the ability of my tank to gain and maintain aggro.  Warriors have been so shafted for so many years, that quite simply put they do not have that ability anymore, unless I am severely restricted in my contribution of damage.<br />
<br />
That is not acceptable.<br />
<br />
I will speak to the Wizard community, and see if a Sympathy Strike can be organized to support your efforts.  Wizards have been crippled on so many levels that it simply is not funny, we are angry, and while we haven't been as badly neglected as Warriors...it is still a grave symptom of flagrant ignorance on the part of Sony.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u247"><b>Moerne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p247">Last night I was watching over my husbands shoulder as our guild was raiding, when a GM popped in.  I don't know what she was there for, but she made a comment in /say  along the lines of &quot;when they stand down on the 18th we'll disband them&quot;  We assumed she hadn't meant to make the comment in /Say and I had no idea what it meant, until I stumbled across a link to this post on another guild board.   <br />
<br />
So just a heads up, and I will try to send some other guildees over to confirm what exactly the GM said.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u248"><b>Quilue</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p248">Hi Folks I completly support your actions.  I was a lvl 61 warrioress in early 2003. Pretty well equiped for the era : windblade, SS armor, CoF etc, etc and with appropriate AAs.  I was soo proud of having my windblade cause prior this my rl friends (a rogue and a monks) was always stealing aggro (yes they evaded and fd to clear it) Area taunt is cool but no way meant to be used for every inc...  With the arrival of PoP we now see trash mobs that go through a warrior in no time b4 a haste is applied.  I never been able to hold aggro after a CoH, a tash or god forbid a slow is casted.  Mainly my rl friend cleric had to root the mob so I could be MA.. pretty pathetic imo.<br />
<br />
Now it happens that one of my others rl was a knight and proposed me for his Replacement tank as I was very often lfg for hours (thats surprising?) Guess what ... They only took knights.. even one time takin a knight 5 lvl lower than me...<br />
<br />
Im now a lvl 65 cleric who feel a lot better appreciated than my warrior.  And I know for a facts that a warrior with BoC+augment and epic+augment still have hard time getting that trash mob of the chanter.<br />
<br />
And as for raid participation for warrior well...  what is the role of warrior again? :P<br />
<br />
Ill be there on The Namess.  Look for Jessaril hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u249"><b>Plugh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p249">I applaud and support this action, but my knowledge of the support levels within the game tell me that some of the methods will not accomplish anything. /petitions get fielded by volunteer staff and escalated to senior staff. The only thing that will be gained from flooding the /petition queues will be that someone with their corpse stuck in a wall, someone who lost all their gear to a game crash, someone who is being harassed by a level 65 asshole bogarting their camp, will all go unaided by the unhired help.<br />
If you want to get something noticed, log a /bug. At Fan Faire Chicago, Absor said it goes straight to his inbox.<br />
Otherwise, the show of presence in pok will be effective. It will raise awareness of the problems. Just please, for the gods' sake, don't /petition.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u250"><b>Shak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p250">Unless I missed some posts (and I was so bored at work I scrolled through EVERY page of this thread), I noticed your most vocal and sensitive warriors are absent in expressing their intentions to participate.<br />
<br />
Where is Furor?  One would think he'd be at the front of the line, waving his &quot;NERF KNIGHTS&quot; banner high and ready to lag out PoKnowledge with the rest of the rebel army.<br />
<br />
I am not knocking your idea at all, I just find it interesting that your main shit-talker isn't out there as a leading figure for your protest.</div></div><hr />
