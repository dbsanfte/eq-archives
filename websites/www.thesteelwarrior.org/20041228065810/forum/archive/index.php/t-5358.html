<br />
Have about 300 AA's and contiplating getting charisma to help give me second chance on raids.</div></div><hr />

Unfailing Divinity 3 (cleric AA)<br />
305 charisma warrior (bard+aa+LDoN augments)<br />
= 90-95% Succes Rate on Divine Intervention<br />
<br />
DI is the most important raiding spell for one simple reason :<br />
<br />
MT die because a &quot;fluke&quot; happens (lag/quad/missed CH/riposte etc etc)  <br />
DI will eliminate 95% of these flukes.<br />
<br />
And DI is all about Charisma</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Yes it's the upgrade to Death pact. :) Uses 2 Emeralds per cast, lasts roughly 10 minutes and with Unfailing Divinity 3 AA and 305 Charisma, seeing DIs for 8khp is common. Very nice for raiding.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Havent parsed or anything but as an ogre one start with kinda low cha. When the guild started to use DI a long time ago it never fired off. Thought it was kinda useless at start as the chanse of working was so low. But i was way wrong.<br />
Get a cha buff and a bard playing cha for you when tanking and you will see a real difference. <br />
DI is your friend...</div></div><hr />

ill never forget one tz fight when about a couple of MTs got wasted, the last warrior had v good cha and lasted it out... DI must have gone off at least 4-5 times. if u can max it out, as another poster said, the only way ur MT is likely to die is if ur clerics are too slow to recast after it goes off...<br />
<br />
<br />
after seeing that fight it became my new religion...</div></div><hr />

It's good for getting babes too.  Since I have had 210 (or maxe 305 with bard) charisma, I think DI has failed at most 5% of the time.  It's nearly always an 8kish heal.<br />

I read the cleric DI/charisma thread a few months back, at the end I was about insane, but I'm now born again.</div></div><hr />

Charisma is the single most important character stat for the raiding warrior. <br />
<br />
I'm in a Teir 3/Emp/VT raiding guild, and am about the 3rd or 4th tank (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=450024) in rotation.  I'm curious as to the opinion of other warriors in regards to swapping out my Featherwood for my GM Smith Hammer when MT on raids.<br />
<br />
Featherwood Compound Bow<br />
<br />
Grandmaster Smith's Hammer<br />
LORE ITEM NO DROP <br />
Slot: PRIMARY,SECONDARY,RANGE,AMMO<br />
Skill Mod: Smithing +5%<br />
STR: +10   CHA: +50   WIS: +10   INT: +10   <br />
Effect: Grandmaster's Satchel (Cast Time: 10.0)<br />
WT: 0.1   Size: SMALL<br />
Class: ALL<br />
Race: ALL<br />
<br />
We are typically bard-poor, and may have one on any given raid.  I also do not have LDoN, so getting cha mods in my armour isn't an option atm.  <br />
<br />
Stick with the Featherwood or swap it out?  And more importantly, why?<br />

i got a scrects in range, but if i dont get a bard into grp i'm most likely swapping my range for a gm item (+50cha).<br />
for di, i seen many 8k goes off at my normal 180cha, few which didnt work at all, it really depends.<br />
<br />
if you got a cleric in grp with div arb and if he got just a little of skill and good conection, he can use that as well to safe you from time to time (it's like 1sec cast time) and balances your group hp out.</div></div><hr />

DI helps prevent death to spikes, but you better bet more ac and hp does an even more reliable job of it. I'll add cha when I can, and I'll take it over stats/resists, but I won't replace hp or ac for it.</div></div><hr />

read what i said. if i would had a bard in group i wouldnt swap out secrets of planes of range for a gm baker spoon. but before? depends on mob, mobs like bertoxx where i know his dps is spikey, i&quot;m going to be sure to have max possible cha, or even better example emp!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">snoedog</div><div class="date">01-29-2004, 06:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why would you not trade out 10ac and 100hp for a better chance of living?  My cleric is my main and I HATE when MT's ask for pot9/symbol/ac and dont leave empty slows for DI, Charisma (nor do they ask for it), or CE for healing.  If you are under 150 charisma then the extra 50 cha is way more important than that 10ac/100hp if you want DI to save your life.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">01-29-2004, 08:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you're in a fight where DI will be firing off VERY frequently, I can see making that case. If you're in any standard case, 10ac/100hp will be of much more use than 50cha. And, if you're going to be in a situation where cha matters that much, you will hopefully have a bard playing cha song getting you up to reasonable levels.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">01-29-2004, 09:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">By loosing hp/ac you are increasing the chances of using DI.<br />
That can not be good.<br />
<br />
DI is here to save your ass in case things go wrong.<br />
<br />
Taking a route that will lead to things going wrong more often,<br />
hoping DI will save your ass more often is unwise.<br />
<br />
Unless you have like 100 cha with bard &amp; buffs i would not give up ac/hp for charisma.<br />
<br />
Not using DI &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; using DI with a higher success rate</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">snoedog</div><div class="date">02-04-2004, 11:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Trust me, if you are fighting a mob that does bursts of damage having a better chance for DI to go off is way better than a meezly 100 hp and some ac.  I play a 65 cleric as well as a 65 warrior and if your cleric has UD3 (aa skill) and the warrior has over 200 charisma there is &gt;90% that it will go off to save your butt.<br />
DI is just a safty net for when your CH chain gets lagged or there is a damage burst from the mob.  It has saved our raids on numerous occasions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just to summarize then, cha works as follows with DI (please correct if this is wrong/inconsistent):<br />
<br />
-caster's cha does not matter<br />
-target's cha WHEN DI IS CAST*** decreases chance of failure as cha increases.<br />
-cleric AA converts fails into partials.<br />
-each level of cleric AA = ~1600pts healed for partial<br />
-target's and caster's cha when DI gets triggered does not matter***<br />
<br />
That sound right?  Re-read the cleric thread, but there wasn't any good summary of results.  Note that the above is consistent with what I've seen while MTing (base 40 cha...).<br />
<br />
RdT.<br />
*** = I've seen it suggested both ways, but not enough data to support either.  I typcially drop cha buffs after DI hits, and (empirically) haven't seen any drop in effectiveness.  Fairly small sample size tho.</div></div><hr />
