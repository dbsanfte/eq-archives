<br />
There is some good info here though if you can bear through the replies :) <br />
<br />
<br />
Hopefully I havent made all the warriors here mad :) <br />
<br />
although I am afraid there are many PoN pallys not to happy with me ... oh well</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chongo</div><div class="date">04-17-2003, 04:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am of the believe that taunt should work 100% of the time and the refresh button should be raised to 60 seconds <br />
<br />
<br />
Hrm. I disagree..<br />
<br />
Even though that would mean you have a failproof taunt (which is basically what AeTaunt is) doesn't mean you 100% keep agro.<br />
<br />
For example:<br />
<br />
Knight is out agroing me, i use the &quot;100%, 60sec reuse&quot; taunt and then get bumped to the top of the hatelist +1. Yes, 5 seconds later, even tho the mob snapped back to me, the knight out agroed me AGAIN.. that's a full 55 seconds before you can use taunt again. That's a full 55 seconds that the 'lesser tank' is getting pounded on.<br />
<br />
Another Example:<br />
<br />
Replace the 'knight' with the shaman. Shaman tries to land slow, however, the mob resisted him 2 times thus far. Mob turns, attacks shaman (unslowed).. You taunt, grab agro, and you're up there at the top of hate +1... Shaman goes to reslow... woops another resist. That mob is on the shaman more pissed than ever. And you can't pry an unslowed mob off off him for another 60 seconds?<br />
<br />
I'm sorry, but i'd rather keep my current taunt/failure rate, and resuse it when neccessary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sanori</div><div class="date">04-17-2003, 04:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't totally agree.<br />
<br />
A week ago, I would have agreed that taunt is broken.  However, last night I had the pleasure of grouping with an incredible group in PoD at LC.  We had a druid as healer, me - 60 war, 56 warrior, 60 ranger, 59 rogue, and a 59 chanter.<br />
<br />
Using a widebladed greatsword, I was able to taunt mobs off the chanter before he even got hit when he slowed.  With the exception of once, when he got resists on the slow and chain casted it.<br />
<br />
In addition, we had almost 0% ping pong - mind you, that was with an epic rogue, epic ranger, and another warrior with a Windblade.<br />
<br />
At this point in the game, I believe aggro control is purely an issue of intelligent people competently playing their classes.  The chanter who stands next to you when they slow - the ranger who gives you 5 seconds before assisting so you can build aggro, the rogue who also waits, the druid who keeps you damage shielded in light of the new changes to DS's, Pallies that learn that stun is a powerful tool - not to be chain casted, etc., etc.<br />
<br />
I don't think an improved taunt button will be a solution, I think all the PLed and twinked toons need to go back and re-group from levels 1 through 55 and learn how to group again.  I think other classes need to visit the warrior boards and learn about warriors and the way we function - I have visited the druid, cleric, wizard, bard, and ranger boards to learn more about their classes.<br />
<br />
Everyone in my group last night went into my friends list, and you can be 100% sure they will be the first people to get tells next time I start a group.</div></div><hr />

A one minute recycle is too long to be useful in exp situations.  Considering a pally can land a stun about every 4-6 seconds assuming they don't get interupted and 1 stun is generally enough hate to peel agro off a warrior who just taunted. How taunt currently works is 100 times better than this idea. Sorry try again.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Roma</div><div class="date">04-17-2003, 05:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with you somewhat Sanori. <br />
<br />
I agree that the its purely an issue of people learning to play their classes. Its pretty crappy when I have to tell the cleric when they should be CHing me cause they are CHing too late and I am nearly going purple everytime. Its also pretty crappy when the wizard is just nuking whenever he feels like it then trying to sit and I have to tell him to slow down, wait til the mob is lower to nuke, etc.<br />
<br />
I disagree that 'all PLed and twinked toons need to go back and re-group levels 1 through 55'. I have a PLed and twinked warrior through 51. Then I ground the rest of the way in groups. I visit the boards, I ask my warrior guildmates/friends questions. I know how to properly use the /shield and /taunt keys. I know when to use /defensive versus /evasive. I have grouped with lvl 60+ warrior mains who have leveled the entire way, have better gear, more hp, but don't know as much about the minor details of the class. Its all a matter of putting in the effort to learn. <br />
<br />
It doesn't matter who you are or what you've done or what level you are. Its 90% knowledge, 10% gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">weoden</div><div class="date">04-17-2003, 05:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I still think that monks need a method to lower agro or have the top of agro list + a little bit increased or have taunt give greater affect at the begining of the fight and taunt becomes less effective as the fight drags on...<br />
<br />
That said, each warrior needs to know what their gear + aa can handle and what it can not handle....  Some warriors can hold agro on a larger range of mobs and you need to know what is difficult for you to keep agro on and avoid those mobs until you get some kind of inprovment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sanori</div><div class="date">04-17-2003, 05:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Roma there's a difference between someone has played a toon from the ground up and then twinked/PLed their other toons.  Those people generally have an idea of what classed do what, and when to do it.  They've been around the block so to speak.<br />
<br />
For clarification, I think there's 2 classes of people who play EQ.  I think there's the people who learn their class, the techniques, the weaknesses and strengths, and the interactions with other classes.  And the other type is those who play, but have hard coded images in their brains about what their class does.<br />
<br />
For example, I used to think that I needed a weapon that had high dmg, low delay for the simple purpose that I was the primary damage dealer.  This was back in my 30s.  As I've matured through the 40s, then 50s, I learned that the weapon I choose is based on me holding aggro - not dmg dealing.  The damage factor is a benefit of the weapon but not the purpose of the weapon.  In contrast, there is a young warrior I know who cannot grasp the concept that rangers and rogues will often double, if not triple, his DPS.  He is not open minded enough to understand that warriors are tanks, not damage dealers.  He thinks he is a lean, mean, killing machine...when in fact he is a diversion for the mob so other classes can do damage.  But he doesnt understand that.<br />
<br />
And every class has those kind of people.  I think that if someone invested the amount of time to get to 60, not to mention take the time to raise cash to buy the gear to get them to 60, that they would have learned about class dynamics by now.  Those that haven't I can identify in the first half hour of grouping, and I tend not to invite them again when building a group.<br />
<br />
Anyway, let me clarify - twinks and PLed toons are not my target.  My target is those people that are close-minded.  We can't get rid of them, but there is always the choice not to group with them.  And that is my solution to taunt.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree with Roma.<br />
<br />
I will admit, I was powerleveled up to 51-52 also and YES, this was and IS my only character.<br />
<br />
However, even though I was powerleveled I do know how to play my class. Not to sound like an arrogant asshole, but I've been complemented on my playing style/abilities numerous times, etc.<br />
<br />
Just cause one was PL'd doesn't mean they lack skills. Plain and simple. A skilled player does make mistakes, but not repeating those mistakes is what makes them skilled.</div></div><hr />

Ahh, good times. Personally, I think that's whats wrong with everyone now, they were either PL'd passed that point, or played in pussy Kunark / Luclin zones and never got to experience something like that, and when they get to the planes, they whine about not being able to keep agro like they could in Overthere / Dreadlands / DSP / &lt;insert boring, repetitive, mind numbing zone name here&gt;.<br />
<br />
It doesn't help these people that they're surrounded by people playing other classes that have taken the same path, and now don't know how to manage their own agro, but that's when you just get very blunt with them, tell them they're being stupid, why they're being stupid, and exactly how they can fix it. If you can't do that, you have no right to bitch about not getting agro.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're confusing different things here....idiots, and twinks.<br />
<br />
I can pick up ANY character, and I can perform their job in a group/raid setting adequately.  I reiterate, ANY character.  Between my friends and I, when I was playing EQ, we had a level 60 of almost every class, including every INT caster, every priest, and most melees, and I played them all interchangably when I needed to.<br />
<br />
Idiots can play any character, and screw it up.  Just like intelligent people, idiots make twinks.  Unfortunately, idiots usually suck so bad at their twinks that eventually they stop getting groups based on their reputation, so they sell all their stuff, buy different gear and make another of a different class.<br />
<br />
I can twink a character, powerlevel him to 55 and use him in the setting I need him in and function appropriately.   Some people can't.  That doesn't make twinks bad.  That makes idiots bad, but we already knew that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Megunna</div><div class="date">04-17-2003, 06:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I want to clarify something, I do think warrior's need some tweaking, but not in their agro abilities. We've always been a class that relied on 3 things: Taunt, Procs / good DPS, and other classes excersising some restraint. This is no different now, nor is the fact that SK's and Pallies can gain and hold agro 10 times better than us. This is as it has always been.<br />
<br />
What the problem is now, that is making Pallies and SK's so preferable, is twofold: The gap between our AC/ HP and their's gets smaller with each expansion, and slows get more and more powerful.<br />
<br />
Personally, I think the resist rate on slow should be bumped up (and the agro a resist of one generates severely decreased), Warrior's defense cap and avoidance skills raised, and we should receive a bit more bang-for-the-buck in reguards to HP gain from STA.<br />
<br />
What this does: Makes warrior's the undeniable top of the pack for taking hits, and makes that status needed, as things may be swinging at full speed the entire fight. Pallies and SK's will still be appreciated for their abilities, but Warrior's will almost always be the preferred tanks, if simply for the sake of the Cleric.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Roma</div><div class="date">04-17-2003, 06:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I second that. When I am lvl 65 and grouped with a semi-uber lvl 65 Pallie/Sk (talking NToV/STish here) the pallie has several hundred more hp than I do. My AC wins outright, but still. Its ridiculous that a decently equipped warrior has such less stats. SOME of it is because I lack AAs, but still. I should be CLOSE to even on hps. 500 hps is a big difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Coray</div><div class="date">04-17-2003, 06:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dislike that idea, and the reason is,  holding aggro on a single mob is not the issue, I have zero problems holding aggro on any one mob I'm attacking, it's every other mob that I'm not attacking thats a problem and causes the most deaths.<br />
<br />
Say you pull 3-5, you should not have any issue holding the one target, it's the 2-4 others that will spin off onto your healer when they fast heal like they have to, to keep you alive.<br />
<br />
Area taunt the aa skill helps, but I think just changing it so that warriors have an area taunt skill say from level 40 on, and the AA skill just makes it 100% every x minutes.<br />
<br />
When damage shields were messed up hate wise, it was very nice to be able to pull sometimes 12+ things on a raid, and be able to keep atleast half of them on me through the opening seconds of the fight without ae taunt.<br />
<br />
That may have been too good, but some form of area taunt ability to try to hold things off of the weaker types is what we need IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frodlin7th</div><div class="date">04-17-2003, 06:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">And now a little common sense to the discussion:<br />
<br />
In a vacuum, all you're saying is right.<br />
<br />
EQ isn't played in a vacuum.<br />
<br />
In reality there's other classes that tank.  They tank just about as well as we do, the difference is barely noticeable.   They compete for spots in experience groups with us, and they get them, because their groupmates don't HAVE to jump through the hoops that we do, and they're so close at tanking that it's irrelevant from a defensive perspective.<br />
<br />
Now, I don't care if YOU think that you must simply educate the masses, but they're not going to be educated, they REFUSE as long as there's a viable option for ignorance.   They're not going to become good at controlling aggro unless they have to.   They don't have to, and that leaves lots of warriors without groups.   There's a basic imbalance of aggro generation between warriors and knights that's not compensated for in the relative difference in tankability.    What that means to the average warrior is his chances of getting a group are minimized because taunt is unreliable or warriors, while aggro generation is trivial for knights.<br />
<br />
So, either one of two things have to happen to rebalance the situation.   Warriors have to be enabled to generate some hatred early in a fight, or knight hate generation needs to be scaled back so that there's a roughly equal difference in mitigation to hate generation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Roma</div><div class="date">04-17-2003, 06:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, the usefulness of paladins and sks is their ability to grab and hold aggro quickly and efficiently. The usefulness of the warrior is to tank things that would simply shread a paladin or sk. Now that the hp/ac of a sk or paladin is soooo close to that of a warrior. Besides the defensive ability, the warrior isn't really 'speshiel' and the defensive isn't as big of an attraction in exp groups. If the amount of hp/ac or max sta we could get was improved, we would have a slightly better hand when it comes down to our role as the tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Apothes Drudoll</div><div class="date">04-17-2003, 06:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As I have stated on the pally board in responce to this 60 seconds is a bit long the refesh time is something that could be played with. without being able to put this on test and test it is is hard to see what kind of affects it weould have.<br />
<br />
I also had the idea that tauns should be changed to use the same reuse time have a 50/50 chance of failing on a fail though it would work garenteed the next time you use it then go back to the rng.<br />
<br />
Just my ideas :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Roma</div><div class="date">04-17-2003, 06:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay... you are a paladin. You are suggesting changes to the warrior. Notice that the dozen or so warriors are disagreeing with you? Not trying to degrade you or your ideas or your knowledge of the game, but I think this is the problem with EQ.<br />
<br />
The designers don't play every class on every server in every encounter. Then they change stuff to 'fix' things. Then the people that do play EQ show the 50 new problems that the designers now have to 'fix'.<br />
<br />
The taunt change is an interesting idea, but there are other changes that could be better solutions to the situation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Megunna</div><div class="date">04-17-2003, 09:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Originally posted by Frodlin7th <br />

<br />
Now I need to breathe some common sense into you. All that would do is trivialize high end encounters, as the MT would simply grab agro as well as any paly, and never lose it. Scaling back Knight agro simply isn't possible. Why? Because if they made stuns cause less agro, you create a new problem with triviality, in that clerics could endlessly chain stun, without worries of a resist and getting beat down.<br />
<br />
As I said, changing the warrior class in response to some ignorant people who cannot manage agro will NOT fix anything, all it will do is cause a LOT of boredom.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baadan</div><div class="date">04-17-2003, 09:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree that Taunt should work 100% (or atleast 75%) but 60 sec reuse is just insane.<br />
<br />
Mob gets pulled, you press Taunt to get aggro. Now you have to wait 60 seconds before the mob can be slowed. If it is resisted.. another minute of getting hit at full speed... by the time the mob should normally be dead you're still waiting for Taunt to refresh for the third time so you can get the mob slowed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Roma</div><div class="date">04-17-2003, 09:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well... the change he proposed was for it to be an unfailing form of taunt w/ a 60 second refresh. Thus, taunt wouldn't be resisted. <br />
<br />
I think that if something's not broke then don't fix it. The taunt key grabs aggro... moreso at 65 than any other level. I've had very few people die because I couldn't get aggro off of them on a single mob (adds or rampage usually do them in). The people that did die were over aggroing or not doing what they could to minimize their aggro. <br />
<br />
If they made the taunt key a 100% thing then it would trivialize the challenge of getting/maintaining aggro. Who cares about an aggro wep when u can just press that taunt key?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chongo</div><div class="date">04-17-2003, 09:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Making things trivial is t3h sux.<br />
<br />
I like a challenge.<br />
<br />
Taunt failed again? Oh well, use another method to keep agro, regain agro, or prevent damage.<br />
<br />
/shield is a BIG tool. works 'almost' as well as a taunt, in a sense.<br />
<br />
You're channeling the damage to yourself, giving you the extra time to land a successful taunt, to proc your weapons, to work up agro, etc.<br />
<br />
We as warriors have MANY tools at our disposal. Getting a 100% failsafe, no risk method of pulling agro would make 3/4 those abilities/tools useless.<br />
<br />
Less trivial. More Skill.</div></div><hr />

Tell me... exactly which &quot;high end encounters&quot; would be made trivial by letting warriors *generate* a small amount of aggro early on in  fight?    Don't be general, I want SPECIFICS.... there isn't a high end encounter in this game where aggro establishment isn't already trivial, and even IF warriors had a way of *generating* a small amount of aggro (as opposed to assuming it as they currently do), they wouldn't use that, because the other methods work FAR better.<br />
<br />
So, you up to a little challenge?  <br />
<br />
Name 3 encounters that would be trivialized by giving warriors a method of generating a small amount of aggro early on in a fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Steenky</div><div class="date">04-17-2003, 11:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok,<br />
<br />
I don't think that the fix for the warrior class is through AA's or more weapons from mobs that most will never see.<br />
<br />
The problem of getting and holding aggro starts far prior to level 51 where even the basic AA's become available.<br />
<br />
At level 9 paladins are (since SoL) given the cheapest form of hate damage with the Cease spell. This is shortly followed by Desist and finally regular stun. All of these spells combined cost under 50 or so plat to buy and are readilly available to anyone who choses to buy them. There are more stuns available in the line as they level up which means that stun locking is doable by anyone with levels and plat to buy the spells. Also, lets not forget Flash of Light and Root. Both of these can center a mob's aggro at will for 30 or so mana spent (aka 10 seconds of standing mana regen for even the gimpiest of charactor post 50)<br />
<br />
These very same newby spells can keep a mob absolutely glued to the afore mentioned Paladin at will with no downtime.<br />
<br />
The offer that he is proposing takes post 61, which doesn't do squat for alot of warriors, and AA points to boot. Add in the 1 minute refresh, and you have a watered down AE taunt that comes too late in the game to benefit the class as a whole.<br />
<br />
What good does my 5500hp and 1250ac(buffed) do when I can't seem to get the aggro? I only can try proximity, weapon selection, /shield, and the taunt button.<br />
<br />
The people with nice equipment and a boat-load of AA's aren't the ones in need so much at the moment as is the general population.<br />
<br />
That better?</div></div><hr />

Its not the uber people that are hurting by not being able to keep aggro, its the people in only semi-decent armor with no *good*proccing/aggro weapons that have to fight in groups with the supertwinks that have this giant HIT ME target on the front of them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kerrion ghoull</div><div class="date">04-18-2003, 04:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok....I've been playing this game for a while now (4 years to be presice and a warrior for 3 of those 4) and I've seen this argument on the boards be beaten around for years and I'm finally gonna post my long winded 2cp worth. <br />
 Warrior taunt leaves a good amount to be desired but it is a normal (non aa) skill and therfore CAN'T work 100% of the time. There should ALWAYS be a chance for failure no matter how small, just like a spell always has a chance to be resisted no matter how small that may be. That being said, warrior taunt has been parsced at something like 70 to 80% success rate which means it's a larger failure rate compared to skills like hide/sneak or even trivial trade skill combines, so yes it does need some work. <br />
I am of the &quot;taunt only when you loose agro&quot; school.  Sometimes I see the mob stay looking at the new agro holder (chanter, cleric, shaman, whatever) for three taunts in a row and sometimes it looks right back at me first try.  Sometimes if it doesn't look back, a weapon will proc before my taunt refreshes and the mob will turn back to me.  All in all it's a good system for me and rarely do I get people saying &quot;TAUNT MORE YOU MORON&quot;.   More often I hear things like &quot;damn dood don't over-nuke you dummie&quot;  or &quot; slow is some major agro :P &quot;<br />
Now the big complaint for the &quot;warrior vs knight&quot; taunt comparison is basically via exp groups and peoples choices. Now don't get me wrong and don't make me sound like I'm a traitor to my class cause I'm not, but I think it is perfectly fine that  knights hold agro like they do *gasp!!! i know, i know, hold on, read some more it gets better!!!*  The reason being is that in exp groups sometimes there isn't a cleric available...so what do you do ...you get  a druid or shaman with their new incomplete heals and you start exping.  Now in the same vein we all know that knights aren't amazing rogue/monk/ranger like dps, so what do they do ...they fill the void for when groups can't find a warrior to tank  and since their taunt skill sucks EVEN WORSE THAN WARRIORS , VI gave them a way to hold agro, that being they can cast spells /boggle.  Why penalize a knight by taking away the only way they have to hold agro and to screw over their chance at getting a group.  Back in the day  a knight couldn't even get a group because no one wanted them (no dps and couldn't taunt for shit) but now the pendulem after a few years has swung the other way.  Give it time it will swing back to middle. <br />
So you say that you get turned down to groups because they have a knight for  a tank. I'm very sorry that happens but you know what, that's life. If that group is happy with a knight then good for them I hope they enjoy their night of exp.  You can go tradeskill or farm items for tradeskill or work on some quest item or EVEN go looking for another group elsewhere.  Show some dignity and don't throw a tantrum.  I find that if you play eq a decent amount people will get to know you.  They might even &quot;like&quot; you and &quot;want&quot; you in a group.  Who knows, you might even find yourself getting &quot;tells&quot; from people to come and join them at xxx camp spot.  Finding groups in eq has always been a social challenge.  Pick up groups are sometimes horrid nightmares and your better off leaving a knight there and looking for greener pastures.  But as you group and use your &quot;people skills&quot; and show these peeps that you actually do know how to play your class ,word will get out and people will start to ask you to join them for a group.<br />
Yes, warrior taunt isn't perfect but people in groups that know how to play their class and choose not to be lazy about casting spells, letting agro build,or being afraid to take some hits,  realize that warriors can be the superior tank and that a knight droping his whole mana bar into holding agro isn't always the best options. It is an option thou and should be in the game, just like the option to have a druid or shaman be group healer or have a beastlord be group slower(on a sidenot last night in POV I was the only slower in the group with ToD and we exped that way for a few hours before picking up a chanter to slow. Did it suck yes...was it better than not exping ...YES) <br />
 Warriors are still vaiable tanks and can still hold agro well even pre 60.  Most of the problems lower lvls experience are the same problems that higher lvls experince. Other people not knowing how to controll agro etc etc.  This is obviously magnified by the difference in gear and lvl but is still made up for by the fact that the warrior has more hp (since its only near higher end that the hp margine between knights and warriors becomes almost miniscule) and the warrior doesn't need to med to keep agro. If you don't like it go Plvl a paladin to 60 and see if you can get a group any faster than your warrior could. I am pretty sure that not everyone specifically goes looking for a knight to tank in their group each time. They just say we need a tank.<br />
<br />
Ok ...ya I think I'm outta steam now....if you made it thru the whole post  thanks for taking the time to listen to one guys opinion of the game (it's just that mind you, an opinion...take it with a grain of salt)<br />
<br />
P.S. one thing I do want to mention that i noticed is rogue's get an AA skill that for each level takes one second off the refresh time for their hide/evade skill.  I know warrior's get one that shortens the reuse time of AEtaunt but why couldn't there be one that takes off a second of the reuse time for our normal taunt skill. That in effect would give us the chance to regain agro faster but not have to improve the % of which taunt succeeds. I don't know just a thought I've been kickin around. <br />

<br />
since SoE likes to give wars discs, (shield disc at 30, and earliest normal discs) maybe they should continue on with the whole disc thing<br />
<br />
like maybe at 40 an activatable disc, reuse time of about the same as /shield, that lasts 4 secs, and makes your next kick generate 120hate, it would be like that SK disc that lets them do hardcore Harm touches, i dont think it would be imbalancing, i mean when my barnacle axe procs, its 100 hate and 50dmg, id say 20hate would be reasonable from 50 dmg, so i dont think 120 would be too far off, and anyone who has weilded a barnacle axe know that u cant just jump in a fight half way through and let it proc once for aggro, its not THAT much hate<br />
<br />
another lil idea that was swimming in my head was some sort of disc that caused your proc rate on your weapons to go from normal to guaranteed for 2 or 3 secs, reuse time around 45mins maybe an hour, and could serve as a last ditch panic button, getting lucky with a quad attack and launching off 4 procs might be nice, and it wouldnt make it endgame only functional, i cant think of many people who are so hated they couldnt get one person to help them get a paetor's blade of debility<br />
<br />
and lastly out of my vault of crazy ideas im rambling about, the thought of some sort of &quot;Graple&quot; disc sounded interesting, i was thinking 45min reuse, maybe less, that providing u were in melee range, would do a 5sec root on both you and the target, that could be just long enough to get in a taunt or a proc, <br />
<br />
and they could tie it all together by making them all share timer, like if u use evasive u cant use defensive til the first one refreshes, well if u used /shield u couldnt grapple til shield refreshes, that way you would have to think about what your gonna use<br />
<br />
<br />
flame me, compliment me on my ideas, whatever it dont matter my words will change nothing in EQ, i just like writing stuff sometimes</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valeris</div><div class="date">04-18-2003, 05:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;....VI gave them a way to hold agro, that being they can cast spells /boggle. Why penalize a knight by taking away the only way they have to hold agro and to screw over their chance at getting a group.&quot; <br />
<br />
I understand where you're coming from but the proposition is not to remove their advantage, simply to lower the gap slightly at the start of a fight. Knights can aggro at range to the point that slow aggro is often trivialised, also once they have a mobs attention they can reliably maintain an aggro advantage in the group so that the group need not worry overmuch about over aggroing during the fight either.  <br />
<br />
So what is overbalanced say about a 2 minute refresh aggro boost to give a warrior more chance of controlling initial aggro,  make it short ranged so there's a chance of fumbling it -  (that gives the ranged spell of a knight the advantage still) hell if the slower is resisted he's gonna have to try to slow again - the aggro boost won't have refreshed so the knight has the advantage in that respect and still has more reliable aggro maintenance during the fight whilst the warrior relies on procs (EB makes it a bit easier but then given the mobs that drop it why shouldn't it?).  <br />
<br />
Giving warriors a small amount of utterly reliable aggro doesn't appear to me to be overbalancing. Certainly not in a raid encounter 'cause in almost every case the warrior is left alone with the mob for 5 - 10 seconds to avoid any problem anyway.<br />
<br />
&quot;Back in the day a knight couldn't even get a group because no one wanted them (no dps and couldn't taunt for shit)&quot;<br />
<br />
I was under the impression that the big reason nobody took a knight was because he was a 'paper tank' he could get aggro fine but relative to a warrior he took a great deal more 'maintenance' making him a poor choice to tank. Verant were right to increase knight mitigation, despite the problem it appears this is causing my class atm. Right now Knights are perfectly legitimate Exp and even (in some circumstances) raid tanks. The old trade off of high aggro Vs. fragility was proven to be unfair and was 'fixed' unfortunately that leaves warriors on the short end of the stick. <br />
<br />
In a vacuum I have no major problem with the way taunt functions at this time - it can be fun to have to react to the situation etc, shielding and what have you - I also have no problem with knights being interchangeable as tank for a group so long as their is a clear and noticeable trade off to doing so. At this time I'm not seeing it, defensive and other disciplines only really come into their own on a raid. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, warrior taunt isn't perfect but people in groups that know how to play their class and choose not to be lazy about casting spells, letting agro build,or being afraid to take some hits, realize that warriors can be the superior tank and that a knight droping his whole mana bar into holding agro isn't always the best options&quot;<br />
<br />
If the above were the case i wouldn't be so concerned. In reality Knights do not sink their whole mana bar into holding aggro. I've not seen a knight yet run out of mana just from aggro controlling, if he's running out it's because he's using his other spells to either enhance his dps or heal himself or the party.<br />
<br />
The superior tank is the tank that can survive a beating AND keep the mobs attention centred on himself reducing the mana cost of heals to keep stress off the parties healer. <br />
<br />
At this time knights have a clear superiority in stickying the mob without any major trade off. About the only thing keeping us getting groups is the long tradition of 'only a warrior will do' which frankly no longer appears to be the case (and i guess thats for the best). No class should monopolise a role (the role in this case being Exp tank) - not the warrior and not knights either.<br />
<br />
Maybe I'm wrong but not raising the concern now and waiting for the pendulum to swing too far the other way doesn't appear to be a good choice either.<br />

<br />
I read on a Pally Board for an idea for Warriors called Dirty Fighting.  Make it a Guaranteed Taunt Like AoE Taunt, but have it only work on one mob at a time and refresh faster (like the suggested one minute).  <br />
<br />
Then if we mistime a Taunt or it fails we can immediately hit it.  <br />
<br />
I do also agree that with the addition of PoP, there are a lot of high level players without the skill of aggro control.  My favorite is channys who cast slow from far away up on a hill.  (Any non-Warriors this is because 1) I have to run over there and 2) if I am in First Person mode I have to spend another couple of seconds mossibly adjusting my screen angle)</div></div><hr />

Exping is a bit more difficult atm, but once my shammy and cleric friends are flagged I will be gtg.  There are plenty of places to kill mobs in PoV/PoS that are always open, there just don't happen to be enough slowers/CHers avail (much more so for slowers).</div></div><hr />

<br />
How much agro does the taunt skill actually cause? Maybe not the frequency that it works, but the amount of hate generated needs to be raised. If they hate us ALOT, it will take that much more to pull it off of us, but it still would not be impossible for a chain casting Knight (or slower or healer) to do so.<br />
<br />
Another question: At this stage in the pendulum swing, wouldn't it be a viable option to forgoe trying to MT when a Knight is around and switch to some form of DPS? I remember one time reading that top damage went like this: Rogue&gt;Monk&gt;Warrior, is this still true? If a Knight is chain casting and using his HP/AC to tank, don't ping pong it! That makes more work for the healer (the very thing that used to be our job to do: make sure the mob was only on one target) If the knight is holding agro alot, switch to a better DPS weapon and just help kill it faster, let the knight have his fun, and know that if he wasn't chain casting, you would have the mob.<br />
<br />
Just a few thoughts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iskandar</div><div class="date">04-18-2003, 11:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A successful taunt boosts ya to the top of the hate list plus a very small amount. An unsuccessful taunt does nothing.<br />

Rogues and monks are significantly higher than most warriors. Takes a lot of AAs and the right gear to crank out considerable DPS. Also high end rangers can own us on DPS, same with high end wizards, mages, etc.</div></div><hr />

How about taunt having a 50/50 chance of working the first time you hit it if it fails the next time in 6 seconds it is 100% then goes back to 50/50 ofcourse if you get the roll for 50/50 then it stays 50/50 for the next time you use it :)<br />

<br />
Dude.. why should I have to buy an AA for stuff that should be implemented to fix warriors? Most warriors consider our class broke, and exp'ing for 12 hours to get X amount of AA pts. to fix us is NOT a solution. <br />
<br />
100% success rate on taunt would make me roll a wizard. <br />
<br />
Knights tankng = fine with me. Plenty of DPS classes out there, couple of healing classes, why not several tanking classes? With that said, it is apparent that knight aggro is greater than our own. They can hold aggro through chain slows or uberguild wizards. Those very Knights (who, in my opinion, are afraid of a nerf to their class) argue that warriors have a considerable jump on HP/AC. We know this is not true. <br />
<br />
I honestly, don't want an aggro change. Aggro is fun. Preparing to loose it, enjoyement when you don't loose it, catching the mobs with taunt as the run to the chanter... that's what standing toe-to-toe with a mob is like. So if Verant decides to fix us, I don't want more aggro. I want to be made of something stronger than paper. Put us on our own mitigation table (*gasp* yes, we're on the same table as knights), make 1pt of stamina worth more, and for the love of all that is sacred get the +mana off my gear, and turn it into hitpoints!<br />

Just as in real life people fire the coach because it's cheaper to replace the coach than replace the team, it's easier to replace (or blame) the warrior than replace the group.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">04-21-2003, 06:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sometimes the best solution isn't the one your group wants to hear (or see).  For example if someone is low HP aggro I don't bother doing anything to the mob (well, maybe a /shield if it seems like there's a chance to save them) because even AE taunt won't beat low HP aggro.  But of course a group often assumes there's actually something I can do even though I'm helping them by not doing anything (because I can save AE taunt if the character gets out of low HP aggro).  Am I taunting a mob when you're low HP?  No, because that will only increase your chance of dying (since I might not have it ready even if you get out of low HP aggro so you can die again), but they'll still ask you 'are you taunting?'<br />
<br />
Another good example I can think of is when there's 2 mobs, one beating on say an enchanter and one is on me that's a good distance away.  I can tell the enchanter is going to get low HP aggro by the time I run up there.  Should I run up to help him?  No, because I'll bring the mob I'm tanking and it will frenzy him and reduce his chance of survival from slim to 0.  So I'm going to stay as far away as possible hoping to draw the 2nd mob out of frenzy range.  But of course often your group expects you to run back and taunt the mob, even though all you do is bring a second mob to frenzy the enchanter.  <br />
<br />
Warrior aggro problem is almost more perceived than real, but in EverQuest, perception is reality.  Just ask the necros who do as much damage as anyone and yet no one seems to want them in a group.  The irony is that any group that benefits from /shield on any consistent basis is much, much better off with a Paladin instead.  But that's not what a group thinks... they'll think you actually saved them and thank you, even though a Paladin would've eliminated that problem from the start, plus tank better (Paladin tanks better than a /shielding warrior by far).</div></div><hr />

Yeah, I got a BoC and a nice amount of AAs (190), I have lil problem keeping agro, but I didn't have much of a problem when I was still using a TSBS for agro. It has not made exping any more enjoyable.<br />
Easy agro and easy single pulls with pacify/harmony took just about any challenge out of this game. I had a lot more fun at lvl 30 in CT with 6 lizards in camp, keeping agro on 3 of em while another tank entertained the other 3.<br />

Quit whining about what knights can do better than warriors, start bitching about the lack of fun/challenge in the game overall.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Basically I am saying the consensus of warriors here is that aggro generation is fine. and if anything SoE needs to tone down the aggro on knights a little because they make Pop a bit too easy?<br />

Don't bite my head off just askin :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frodlin7th</div><div class="date">04-21-2003, 03:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Apothes,<br />
<br />
The general consensus that I've seen is basically this:<br />
<br />
The Warrior vs Knight aggro generation gap is too large in relation to the warrior and knight durability gap.<br />
<br />
Some people, such as Phantron, etc. believe strongly that the &quot;standard&quot; should be a lot closer to current warrior aggro generation than current knight aggro generation.   In essence, that knights' aggro generation should be toned way down, or that there be some significant tradeoff in terms of medding time to maintain the level of aggro generation which they enjoy.   Their position is that the easier it becomes to maintain aggro on a tank, the more boring and rote this game becomes and the less skilled people have to be to play it.<br />
<br />
Other people on the other hand, desiring not to see another class get nerfed, think that raising the level of aggro generation to closer to that of knights than it currently is is the answer.   <br />
<br />
There's a 3rd group who believes that the key to this is to increase the &quot;durability spread&quot; between warrior and knight to a noticeable level making groups choose between the *obvious* (i.e. not theoretical, but noticeably) better &quot;tank&quot; and the one better at aggro control.    <br />
<br />
I tend to fall in line in a small way with the #2 group, but with a spin.    I think that the problem with aggro generation has been identified as being something that happens early in fights in PoP, where a slow cast or resisted can mean a splatted shaman or enchanter, or a heal can mean a splatted cleric.<br />
<br />
I believe pretty strongly that once that has been identified as the issue, then solutions can be brought up to compensate or deal with it.   For instance... I personally have proposed the &quot;hate arrows&quot;.... fletched arrows which add a specific numerical amount of hate, but through a non-stackable &quot;debuff&quot; that leaves an icon similar to Donal's BP (Ranged attack means it's limited to a range, and can't be used during normal combat with any efficiency, and the &quot;icon&quot; meaning that it cannot have an additive effect whereas a warrior kites a mob around with a few arrows ensuring &quot;aggro lock&quot;).  Others have proposed &quot;skills&quot; such as hurling insults which do essentially the same thing.   <br />
<br />
In either case, most of the objections raised are accounted for.   Does it trivialize high end raid encounters?  Nope, not unless you have been doing high end encounters without figuring out how to do aggro transfer pulls through the use of weaponshield, which is signficantly superior to any of the proposed methods.    Does it make warrior &quot;taunt&quot; too strong?  Nope, it simply adds a single tool to assist in generating aggro where it's needed.   Not assuming someone else's aggro such as in the taunt skill, but generating some of your own.    Finally, if done through reagent itemization (such as hate arrows), it's available to all for a small price, and doesn't rely on AA points spent or anything like that.<br />
<br />
I also tend to agree with many of those who have spoken here that making taunt *too* reliable would certainly make my playtime boring, and I wouldn't want to have it so easy.  On the other hand, I also don't think i want to see the spread between knight and Warrior in terms of the aggro gap be as glaring as it is today.</div></div><hr />

You'll notice that I tried to give a pretty fair summation as to what the various positions were.    If they felt misrepresented, they're more than welcome to speak up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">04-21-2003, 04:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's no question that the aggro difference between Knights and Warrior is too large, and that only leaves two solutions.  Nerf knights, or buff Warriors.  <br />
<br />
Nerf Knights is the right solution when you consider game integrity &amp; design, assuming that EQ was never intended so that you can cast a level 9 spell and hold the mob's attention forever.  <br />
<br />
Pros:<br />
1.  Nerfing doesn't break the game.  The Paladin stun line can be gone from the game tomorrow and the game will still function.  Yeah Paladins will have it hard controlling aggro, but they still bring plenty of other benefits to a group.  I don't know much about how to fix SK since I can count on the one hand the number of SKs I have grouped with.  <br />
<br />
Cons:<br />
1.  People cry over nerfing.<br />
2.  Groups will actually now have to learn how to control aggro, and from my grouping experience, this is really hard.<br />
<br />
Suppose we buff up warriors instead:<br />
<br />
Pros:<br />
1.  Warriors are happy, and since there are a lot more warriors than Knights, that means everyone is happy (relatively).<br />
2.  Further, your group is now happy too.<br />
<br />
Cons:<br />
1.  Make the game more or less trivial on the XP level (even though it sort of is already, but it doesn't need to get even less trivial).<br />
2.  Knights might not be able to get a group anymore.  If you don't need  Knight for aggro, what else do you need one for?  Warrior tank better and do more damage.  If the mob is always on the warrior, you really don't need significant crowd control abilities.<br />
<br />
The aggro problem is perceived in the sense that it's only bad because people think it's bad.  It's obviously there, but you never needed Knight aggro if you have a good group or even just a group that will listen.  But because Knight aggro exists, people become reliant on that and you'll find yourself in a group where the wizard tries to pile as many nukes as possible and wonder why you can't get it off him, even though the game is never intended to be played this way.  <br />
<br />
And like I said before, it's easier to fire the warrior than fire the group.  Most people tend to prefer to blame on the warrior's inability to keep aggro (which is stupid, as warriors have no means of generating extra aggro besides taunt.  Even EB weapons aren't aggro on demand) as opposed to their own inability to control aggro, and there is only one of you but potentially 5 of them in a group.</div></div><hr />

Uhh, which ones are?  Stun and Holy Might?   Neither a cleric in PoP would *ever* load up... ever because they don't affect the mobs.   The caster of such spells gets the message &quot;Your opponent is immune to the stun portion of this effect&quot;.     <br />

I'd like your list of joint Paladin/Cleric stuns which affect level 60+ mobs in PoP.   Please!   I certainly hope you're not arguing that such a thing would trivialize clerics casting shared spells that dont' do anything to the mobs you're fighting.   <br />
<br />
I'll expect the list of shared Paladin/Cleric stuns that land on PoP mobs... about the same time I get your list of mobs which would be trivialized by allowing a warrior to generate a small amount of ranged aggro.   <br />
<br />
See, it's one thing to be wrong, it's entirely anouther to be wrong while calling people jackasses.   You really look the fool when you do that.<br />

<br />
You're arguing phantom problems I think.    I've identified the problem several times as the exact same thing, the difference in tankability does not justify the difference in aggro control.     It's a balance issue, something has to give one way or another, whether you want to call it phantom or not is beside the point, cause well....to you it's phntom, to a lot of other people it's entirely real.   Warriors are supposed to have things to offset disadvantages, and currently we don't.    <br />
<br />
Was it &quot;always&quot; the way that if a warrior lost aggro the enchanter or shaman would be left as a pool of sticky goo at the bottom of a mob's shoe?  In othe words, when the environment forces a balance change, then &quot;It's always been&quot; is no longer a valid argument.   You're applying yesterday's standards to today's EQ.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, but it's probably the easiest way to fix the problem.  Make a couple weapons crap, big deal..you've fixed the core of the problem...well, at least on mobs over 50 that are unstunnable.<br />

Besides that, it just makes sense.  It's like in cartoons when people throw a snowball at the ice god.  He just stands there with his hands on his hips laughing at you.

I would tend to think leave knight aggro as is maybe add the stun change. and boost war HP's and duel weild DPS<br />

Since they tuyrned down riposte in PoP I think duel weild is a viable option now ( although I have not tested it with any of my duel weild chars since most are lower) :p</div></div><hr />

If you make all stuns not produce aggro if it won't effect a mob?  It can work, but there could be a nasty fallout from both Paladins and people who relied on stun procs before.  Also there's still the 2 60+ stun you've to worry about.  These shouldn't be aggro free but shouldn't be enraging blow in a box either.  Although VI doesn't compromise game integrity just because people will whine, it's pretty obvious that they want to avoid things that'd obviously cause a ton of crying.  Just look at how long it took them to fix charm and let enchanters get away with xp way better than whatever VI originally intended, even though it'd have been trivial to slap a nerf that'd make charm useless.<br />
<br />
Dual wield DPS is fine... it's basically worthless at the high end and with weapons like Windblade even the lower end is getting effected, but the game can survive with that.  I really don't think VI is going to go back to every dual wieldable weapon in the game and then retweak their ratio to compensate.  If you don't change the ratio, that really doesn't leave you much choice.  As far as I can tell, all weapons hit in the same spectrum so you can't just do something like make dual wield weapons tend to hit higher.  I don't think the game supports coding that would make enemy have less defense to 1H weapons.  So the only thing you can tweak is damage bonus on 1H, but somehow I don't think that will work by itself.</div></div><hr />

Until then, drop the agro generated by stun spells.  <br />

Sure, stuns will piss you off, but not anywhere near the same as the raging monkey cutting you to a million pieces with the double whirling blades of death or the healer standing behind him keeping the guy alive.<br />

Stun is a powerful damage mitigation ability so it should have aggro assigned with to it.  But it doesn't make sense if a stun can't effect a mob at all and still make it angry.<br />
<br />
This is true with summoning and the snare line too.  The mob must think something like: I can get anyone with ever moving my feet, but I'm still really mad there are these roots on my feet slowing me down because I hate roots.  Oh yeah, and for non summoning mobs, I'm really mad at someone I can't actually catch (since snare lines land pretty easily).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 05:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can tell you right now that nerfing SK agro will cause more problems than you think.  Agro generation is at pretty much most of what SKs can do until higher levels.  All of our buffs are self only, we bring nothing but some more dmg and pulling/tanking to a group.  Pallies will get groups on average more because of group heals and BMB/buffs.<br />
<br />
Being the kings of agro (more ways to generate and lose agro than any other class almost) does absolutely squat for most SKs...we still sit LFG a good amount of the time, unless we know enough people.  Of course, the same could be said to you on tanking.  We can solo some, yes...but soloing really sucks.<br />
<br />
Paladins should be your bigger worry than SKs...they do most of their dmg by melee, group heals, group buffs, and can hold agro better than warriors.  I know a 65 paladin who has about 130wis, because he doesn't do much other than stun and group heal.  He wants to be on the same level with tanking as a warrior tho, but doesn't want to give up his spells.../boggle <br />
<br />
IMO, SKs should be your best friends (along with clerics).  There you have a class that can increase your innate agro (the Voice line), can pull (wearing plate armor, DA, FD, and snaring helps more than people think), can hold agro over slowing for you (you can taunt off him or even /shield him while taunting), and they can lose whatever agro they get by FDing.<br />
<br />
I agree with you all that warriors need to be looked at.  But agro management shouldn't be the main concern (bump taunt success to 90% average and that'll be good).  Like many of you, it's the disparity between the &quot;best&quot; tank (warriors) and the &quot;just as good&quot; tanks (SKs and Pallys).  Warriors are better yes...and yeah it doesn't mean jack squat when the mob will pass you up because taunt fails...but if the benefits of having such a better tank mean anything, then people will choose warriors.<br />
<br />
All warriors I know love my SK (although I'm getting rather bored of her)...I give them an extra 10% agro, and let them take agro on pulls because I want to do DAMAGE (which is easier when the mob isn't pounding on you...7sec cast time spells suck).<br />
<br />
Paladins are stacked, no doubt about that (yet they still complain...shows you that complaints tell you more about the ideas and expectations of the complainer than what they're complaining about).  At 65 they can give you better than Aego, have nice fast heals, can stun and everything.  Only way to &quot;fix&quot; is to make it where a stun which the mob is immune to does not give them the agro from it.  Sure, they get stuns that effect 60+ mobs, but they can't chain cast those as much.<br />
<br />
I'd compare the problems with warriors to the problems with clerics.  Some people might think &quot;Clerics should have no problems, they're the best at healing.&quot;  Nevermind that shaman/druid heals are satisfactory for 90% of the people out there.  People on this very message board have stated that they'd rather have a druid/shaman than a cleric because all a cleric can really do is heal, while druid/shaman bring SOOO much more to the group/duoing.  Warriors are same way...Knight tanking is so close to warriors (close enough), and they can hold agro so much easier, and they bring more to the group (well, paladins mainly), that people simply don't want a warrior (unless they're friends or know how to work with a warrior).<br />
<br />
Only three solutions come to mind.<br />
<br />
1) Give ALL pure melees special abilities (cmon, three expansions and pure melees get NOTHING while the other classes gain spells).  At least start giving melee only armor melee focus effects or something, or even more /disc/abilities other than AA to make melees more fun.  Warriors have some of the most interesting AAs IMO, but frankly I see little reason to play one other than raid tanking.<br />
<br />
2) Change stuns to only give agro if it's resisted or lands...but give no agro if the mob is immune to stuns.  This could require some thought.  SKs are designed to have agro abilities now...but we can FD it off, whereas a Paladin can't.<br />
<br />
3) Make Silence or mana draining/proc stripping abilties more common.  (A hybrid is just a second rate warrior without their spells)<br />
<br />
Sorry for the long post...I'll try to keep them short from now on. ^_^</div></div><hr />
