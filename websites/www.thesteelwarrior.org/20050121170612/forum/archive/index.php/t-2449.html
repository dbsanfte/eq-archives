  A pirate walks into a bar, sits down and orders a drink.  He's a typical looking pirate with a peg leg, eye patch, and a hook for a hand.<br />
bartender- Hey, are you a pirate<br />
 Pirate- Arrgh, that I am matey<br />
bartender- I dont mean to be rude, but you dont seem too successful for a pirate.<br />
 pirate- arrgh, but I am.  Just not with the animals<br />
bartender- Animals, what do you mean.  Tell me what happened with your leg<br />
 pirate- arrgh, we were pillaging a ship in the south pacific, when I fell off the boat, and a mako shark bit it off right at the knee<br />
bartender- oh my god, thats awful, what about your hand<br />
 pirate- arrgh, we were in the everglades burying the booty from the south pacific, when an alligator sprung out and bit off me hand.<br />
bartender- holy shit, no way.  Now whats with the patch<br />
 pirate- arrgh, after we buried the treasure, I was looking into the sky, when a bird flew past and shit in me eye<br />
bartender- he shit in your eye<br />
 pirate- arrgh, right in me eye<br />
bartender- dont mean to call you a liar, but I dont think you can lose your eye over bird shit.<br />
 Pirate - arrgh, but you gotta realize mate, that was the first day I had me hook.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maktar</div><div class="date">08-12-2003, 03:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Jesus and his apostles were traveling back to Nazareth and just outside the village they came upon an angry mob. People were shouting and there was a woman huddled on the ground covering her head. <br />
<br />
Jesus went to the woman and asked &quot;My child, what are you afraid of?&quot; <br />
<br />
The woman answered &quot;They think I am a whore, and have dragged me out here to stone me to death.&quot; <br />
<br />
Upon hearing this, Jesus addressed the large crowd. &quot;Why do you wish to stone this woman? It is not man's place to judge this woman. I say to you, Let he who is without sin cast the first stone!&quot; Suddenly, a large stone came wizzing from the rear of the crowd, striking the woman and killing her where she stood. <br />
<br />
As Jesus began to work his way through to find the culprit, the crowd parted to reveal a lone woman standing there. Jesus approached the woman, with a look of disgust and said &quot;You know Mom, sometimes you really piss me off!&quot;</div></div><hr />
