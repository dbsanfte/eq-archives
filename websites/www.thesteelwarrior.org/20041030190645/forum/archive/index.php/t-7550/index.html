<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sekanya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi,<br />
<br />
I am a lvl 55 Vah Shir Warrior. I am really starting to get into this toon alot and am really enjoying it.<br />
<br />
But, as I get higher levels, I get more and more worried that the gear and weapons that I have arent as good as they should  be.<br />
<br />
Here is a link to my Magelo account...would any of you be so kind as to look it over and give me any suggestions?<br />

<br />
I can't claim to be the smartest warior ever as well. i am new to the game, I created a toon to fight with my husband who is a 65 cleric. So any sugestions you might throw my way as to what a good warrior entails (I know, that could take forever) and quick tips or hints would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
But most of all, I am just looking for feedbak on my gear and weapons.<br />
<br />
Thank you all for your time, it's greatly appreciated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You are very much lacking in visible armor pieces. Your non-visible pieces are just fine. I honestly can't think of what stuff you can upgrade into, but I know there is stuff! Uhhh... check acrylia plate armors, for one. I know some LDoN normals drop some all right tradable pieces as well. I'd check the bazaar and see what you can find. Other than that, get a SotB for your offhand and sell the swiftblade. Stun proc &gt;&gt; no proc at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sekanya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hiya,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your reply!<br />
<br />
What exactly do you mean by visible armor and non visable armor? Excuse my ignorance :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Visible = pieces of armor other people can see on your character armor. Helm, arms, gloves, BP, leggings, boots and bracers. Jewelry, cloaks, shoulders, mask are all non-visible on your character.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sekanya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hi,<br />
<br />
Oh! Ok, I see what you're saying now :)<br />
<br />
How do my stats suchs as unbuffed HP / AC stack up for my level? Am I doing ok in that department?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Your hps are fine, but your AC is very low. Try picking up an Archtect's Bejewled Chestplate and a Helm of Raldukan as some easy upgrades.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Oops, I forgot my default comments. I should put it in my sig. 1ac = 6hp = 1sta until sta is capped unbuffed. Everything else isn't very important, unless it's like &lt; 5hp or only 1 ac for some very significant other stat upgrade. By very significant I mean &gt; 15. Most things that have good ac and hp will also have good resists/other stats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">hit the bb camp and check out the 150point armor. you dont want to buy it, but it will be a guidle for what to look for in the bazarr ac wise.<br />
<br />
acrylia is ok for ac but lacks stats.<br />
<br />
ss or thurg armor might work for ya.<br />
<br />
steel wrapped should be good<br />
<br />
head to umbral plains and get some moktor peices.<br />
<br />
lotta options<br />
<br />
also at 55 you can make ornate provided you have the cash</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Spacely Sprocket</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Fierce Heraldic is some of the best droppable warrior armor you can get for the price, has great ac and great hp...downside is if you don't worship RZ you are out of luck =(<br />
<br />
Spacely Sprocket 34 warrior of Prexus<br />
<br />
I just looked at yer magelo and saw your agnostic /bonk forget fierce heraldic input<br />
guess i should learn to read before i open my mouth</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Elfried</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Another option you should consider (if you not already did) is to get some easy AC Update via Tribute.<br />
You can take tribute Haste 41% too and replace your SCHW with Kylong darkmail gauntlets for example.<br />
For your head: Helmet of Rallos Zek is the best but expensive. Look for Helm of Raldukan.<br />
Shoulders: look for Crystalliced acid pauldrons or Forged Shoulderpads.<br />
<br />
When you check all your slots for good AC you should easily reach 1200AC and more with bazaar stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Rakaul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">There are other options for you to look at too depending on your race.  There are made armours similar to Fierce Heraldic that is not tied to a deity but just to races.  I am a Dark-elf and have a few pieces of Teir'dal Regent armour.  You can look at my magelo below to see what I mean.   I know there is similar stuff for other races I just don't know the names of them.   <br />
<br />

<br />
Easiest thing to do is goto the bazaar and select what you are.  Race, class and then select things like armour class under stats and then select the slot part, then sort by AC after you hit the find button.  Just make sure you can wear what you see because there will still be some deity specific stuff that can show up that you can't wear.<br />
<br />
Oh and it was mentioned before but sell the swiftblade of zek.  Not sure what server you are on but on Stromm that thing sells for 40k fairly quick and you can get the sword of bloodsworn for 7k.  That should give you a good bit of plat to buy some armour.  Oh Bejeweled BP and kylong greaves are normally very cheap(relatively) and are upgrades to have you are currently using.  Look into those.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I strongly agree that your visible armor slots should be first up in the upgrade order. The suggestion about heading to the bazaar and searching by race, class, slot, and your budget is a good one.<br />
<br />
Hmmm. Helpful tips are a little more difficult. I'll assume you're main tank in an experience group, you don't know everyone in your group, and you are not pulling (though in places where you can pull, then pull). Good tanks do certain things, in my opinion: <br />
they have a good idea of the capacity of the mobs they are facing (which are casters, which are not; which are toughest, what order the mobs ought to be killed in, etc); <br />
they get a good sense of the aggro range and respawn rate of the mobs they are facing (even if they are not pulling); <br />
they position mobs well, and not just randomly; <br />
they communicate well with the people they are grouping with; <br />
they adjust quickly to the strengths and weaknesses of their group; <br />
they always know where their groupmates are and where the mobs are; <br />
they understand what other classes need from a tank.<br />
<br />
If I'm in a group with pet classes, I usually tell the group that I will position mob so that its back is to pet X. It's a lot easier for folks to park their pets in a good spot than it is to re-position their pets in mid-fight. Also, it gives other melee, particularly rogues, an idea of at least where you hope the back of the mob will be. Usually it allows me to face my casters, which I find useful for various reasons (though that's personal preference to some degree--many fine tanks prefer to face away from their casters).<br />
Understand /shield and use it when it makes sense to do so.<br />
Announce mez breaks, and break cleanly. If enchanter wants you to break mez on  a certain mob first, then do as they say. Otherwise, you pick.<br />
In LDoNs, often a puller has to go through a door to get to mobs. I usually stand next to the door and keep it open, so the puller doesn't get whacked a couple extra tiems as he waits for the door to open. This should be obvious, but lots of people don't do it.<br />
If someone else is higher than you on the aggro list, taunt first, then use incite line and kick (successful taunt will leap you over the aggro of the other player, then the incite will sit on top of that; if you do it in the reverse order, either the initial hate of the incite or the taunt is wasted).<br />
Ask periodically how mana is doing, especially in a pick-up group or a group where a non-cleric is main healer. Concerning whether a group is ready for more mobs, always vote with your healer and crowd control assuming the casters are reasonably good.<br />
There is always some bottleneck or other that will limit the speed at which a group can kill stuff. Sometimes that will be crowd control, sometimes dps, sometimes healing mana. Whatever it is, know it, and do whatever you can to adjust.<br />
Sometimes it is very tempting to switch mobs, but if you're MT avoid it if at all possible. The main exceptions are if you don't have an offtank and a caster is getting pounded.<br />
Sorry if all this is obvious to you. There's other stuff, but mainly your two jobs are to keep aggro and take a punch. If you do those things, that's basically your job. If you can do the other things to make a group more productive and fun, then the people you grouped with before will actively seek you out to play with. The good thing about doing the little things is that the better players you meet will notice long before the idiots will; the good players will want you in their groups, so over time the groups you get are better and better.<br />
If I've done an LDoN or any other group with someone who I've noticed is good, I'll send them a tell complimenting their play at the end of the group/adventure. That also helps over time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sekanya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">All I can say is WOW! Thank you all for all of the great recommendations and stuff...I will be hitting the bazaar today and seeing whats there for me to upgrade too.<br />
<br />
I'll repost my magelo link when I've done an upgrade!<br />
<br />
Thanks again so much.<br />
