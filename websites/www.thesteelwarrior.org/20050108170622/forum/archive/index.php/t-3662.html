Has a sweet loot table now, and anyone have that new 2hs EB wep? Wondering if the kill is worth the hard fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draganetti</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 09:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The new Inny fight is fairly complex.  <br />
<br />
Nevermind, don't wanna give it away.  :P  The big clue I'll give you is: kill the golem/rock things and mez the imps/clerics.  It takes a good ammount of CC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kabal</div><div class="date">10-15-2003, 01:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Go in clear all gaurds in and around inny's room...buff up then rush the fake inny....make sure everyone is in the throne room when he dies...he has a large aggro radius and you don't want to pull adds....<br />
<br />
When fake inny dies a cleric of hate spawns outside...have your raid move all the way to the back wall by the throne...the cleric of hate walks away from the throne room and spawns the real inny and some gaurds...have bards lull them and pull inny back...make sure everyone is levi'd..... corner him and kill...his rampage is an small radius ae proc so if your health gets low back away and ask for a heal...his ae will summon everyone to him and up into the corner(thats what levi is for)...nukers try to time it b/c sometimes you may not be able to &quot;see your target&quot; if you get right under him after the g flux proc....if you get adds on the pull have a chanter/bard mez them then kill after the fight....fight will last about a minute<br />
<br />
Anyway, thats the best i remember...if i left something out or whatnot then just correct me=)</div></div><hr />

Raid was 47 people strong, not perfectly balanced (low on chanters/shamans) but enough dps (mages/wizards).</div></div><hr />
