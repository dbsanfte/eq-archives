<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grixz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just curious if anyone knows how to &quot;minimize&quot; the EQ program (when in Windowed mode) and to get back to the desktop so that I can browse the Internet?<br />
<br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bloodheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I believe it's different depending on your OS. For me, I have to alt-enter, then shift+alt+r.<br />
<br />
Hope it helps =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Or, when you have it in windowed mode, just hit the Windows key (that button between CTRL and ALT) and find your IE (hopefully you are smart enough to use Mozilla Firefox or some other non-IE browser) and it will load that way. I have Mozilla, Show Desktop, EQ, and AIM in my quick launch taskbar so I can do almost everything I need to from there, and if I need something from my desktop, I just hit Show Desktop and EQ will minimize. Of course you can always just Minimize EQ the old fashion way and get at what you need, but that's not a very l33t h3x0r way to do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Talena Waterflower</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I just hit Alt+Enter (pray for no black screen of death), window key, Alt+M (minimize) and off I go.  Switching in and out of windowed mode is a bit worse odds than russian rhoullette for me, get the black screened window and its eq crash time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well well well, i guess I'm not alone. I'm constantly switching in and out of EQ while I play. That black screen is sooo annoying. I find myself considering if the potential crash is worth me switching out before I do it. Its the only bug type issue I have with eq atm.<br />
<br />
On a related note, I wish you didn't have to release the mouse from EQ. I should be able to just mouse out of the window like every other game that I play windowed. maybe they'll get around to fixing that one day. That programmer dude is working on a framerate cap for EQ, to make windowing easier, maybe he'll hit the mouse issues and black screen next...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Quincent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I just use EQ Windows (http://www.eqwindows.com/) cuz I hate Sony's windowed mode. Been using it since I started playing 2 years ago.<br />
<br />
Works great I think, and you should try it out. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Theres a windows update you can install that will allow you to alt-tab as well, instead of having to alt+enter.<br />
<br />
I can't remember what It's called atm, but I installed it and don't have to release my mouse anymore, just alt tab straight to whatever.'<br />
<br />
The only way I crash doing so is if i /q or camp to login screen, and login  to a server a second time without going completely to desktop .</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grixz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">First took Bloodheart's advice and tried the Alt+Shift+R (in window mode) to release the mouse pointer, then minimized the window.  There was some lag but at least I was able to start another window.<br />
<br />
Also, looked into EQWindows, but, I never tried any 3rd party &quot;add-on&quot;s ever (except recently experimented with new EQInterfaces), in fear that it may give SOE a reason to say that I had violated some agreement.  I did try it once, and at least it did work, but I felt paranoid using it...<br />
<br />
Is EQWindows against the EULA?<br />
<br />
Finally thanks Mearis, I am downloading that utility from Microsoft, seen it loooong time ago but forgot where I put the info.<br />
<br />
Thanks to everyone!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Fuzzee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I CONSTANTLY play windowed mode.  I just find it the easiest for me.  I adjust the gamma though so it's basically normal.  The only problem is for some reason then if I switch accounts by logging back to the server screen, whenever I zone it totally blacks out.  Otherwise I Shift+Alt+R all the time and generally have AIM, AOL (Radio), and 2-3 Explorer windows open.  Great for tradeskilling/questing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yes EQw is against the EULA but it's about as offensive as jaywalking.</div></div><hr />

You'll find a quote from a recent fain faire stated by an SOE rep about this subject on the EQ Windows web site.  He essentially said that, yes, it is technically illegal, but that it &quot;isn't on our radar screen at this time.&quot;<br />
<br />
It gives you no real time advantage in game, such as a speed hack or plat duping, or warping, instakilling mobs, etc. would, and it facilitates people paying them extra money to run multiple accounts on one machine, so I think they are highly unlikely to come after you for it.<br />
<br />
To your original question, yes.... EQ Windows in combination with EQ Playnice, have been godsends for me.  You can customise the keyboard settings to switch sessions, minimize, etc. however you like.  And it's fast. And with Playnice running in the background, EQ eats up so few resources that you can run a few sessions on a modest EQ capable machine and still have browser, etc. running in the background.  I've set it up so I can quickly Alt-Tab though whichever accounts I have running, or use another setting to just show the desktop if I want to go check something in the browser, look at e-mail etc.<br />
<br />
It's worth a look.</div></div><hr />
