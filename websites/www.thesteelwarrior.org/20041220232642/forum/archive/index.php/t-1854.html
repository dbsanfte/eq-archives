<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scargoth</div><div class="date">07-09-2003, 05:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would like to see shields as a more viable choice for warriors.  Right now the only place you really see warriors using them is with furious bash shields that are mostly only attainable at the high end game.<br />
<br />
What I would like to see is a new skill that warriors get early (like around lvl 45 or so) that lets us Double Bash when we have a shield equipped.  This should be a warrior-only skill.  This would help offset our dismal DPS when using shields since we can only use &quot;normal&quot; 1h weapons, we do not get the 22dmg 21dly 1h weapons that knights get.  It would also help for interrupting spells, and ultimately will help with holding agro a lot better with a shield equipped.<br />
<br />
Just curious what you guys think of this idea.</div></div><hr />

My warrior is a Froglok so he has to switch out a weapon to put on a shield.  But that kills his DPS pretty bad.  About the only time I use a shield is when I'm fighting a mob that I know can CH itself.  Otherwise I stick to my uber 15pt kicks(/sarcasm off ;)) and whatever dual wield combo I'm using.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bunnie Burner</div><div class="date">07-10-2003, 07:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't see why people want to use shields.. I really don't.<br />
<br />
Dual Wield is one of the best advantages warriors get, but let's throw that out as well?<br />
Let's make using shields better then dual wielding.. that way Knights get an advantage there as well... considering they have no choice but to put a shield there... and considering their 1handed weapons are insane to compensate the fact they use a shield.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scargoth</div><div class="date">07-10-2003, 04:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was suggesting this be a warrior-only skill, so this would not affect knights.  And I'm not hoping for shields to become better than dual weilding, I just want more options.  Personally I think using 1h/1h, 1h/shield, or 2h should all be viable choices for a warrior.<br />
<br />
They are not going to be able to make 1h weapons any better because they can't enforce using them with shields like they can with knights.  So if we are going to use 1h/shield combos at all the place to add improvement is on the shield.<br />
<br />
Our main job is to take damage and in general our ability to absorb or deflect damage is much increased with a shield equipped in comparison to dual weilding.  I ran a parse that showed my defensive damage per second dropped from about 70 DDPS to 48 DDPS in an exp group in BoT when I equipped my shield.  If I need a better defensive solution, where my offensive DPS is a secondary concern then using a shield should be a good choice.  But unless you have a Furious Bash shield, it really isn't due to the massive loss of agro.  This is why I would like to see a change like adding Double Bash -- it would help for holding agro when we have a shield equipped.</div></div><hr />
