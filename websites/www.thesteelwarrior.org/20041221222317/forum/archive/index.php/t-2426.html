 <br />
 Crowd Control.  If we have no mezzer, they park root mobs and tank one when we have 3 or more in camp, and they tank the second mob if there are two in camp.<br />
 <br />
 Pull.  Using their spells, they can sometimes pull better than I as a warrior (getting singles) and can do it more efficiently than others in the group who need to med.<br />
 <br />
 Secondary Healer.  Throwing a LoH or a heal on the cleric who is about to go squash is very helpful.  Also, the ability to rez group members after a wipe or partial wipe when no cleric is along or just rezzing the cleric if the cleric got wiped... all very helpful.<br />
 <br />
 Buffs.  Brells helps.<br />
 <br />
 DPS.  Paladins are not good at this, but any DPS is better than having a second cleric in group.<br />
 <br />
 Tank.  I know, I said I was the tank in the group at the beginning, but if I am doing a long experience stretch I will have to go AFK every once in a while to grab food, drink, or to make a quick bio-break.<br />
 <br />
 Okay.<br />
 How many of the things I just listed could a second warrior do effectively in my group instead of a paladin?  DPS or tank while I am AFK.  Do paladins have a role outside of just tank in a group?<br />
 <br />
 YES:<br />
 <br />
 Crowd control, Pull, Secondary healer (and rezzes), Buffs.  I enjoy having a paladin in my group.  They have great utility when played well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;But but but, if you have a cleric and that cleric has so much mana that he never gets low mana, and you have crowd control and you have the perfect group set up  you never invite people just cause they're friends or lfg, and you have a warrior to tank then none of that helps so i deserve to be better at tanking than you warriors cause 1 in 20 of you gets to be smacked around by a mob on a raid.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yay my first official 'whiney' post.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">08-07-2003, 08:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, Paladins can do other things.  But many of the other things you've listed are done better by another class altogether.  So, the Paladin point that they don't really get many groups based on their secondary functionality is pretty true.  Paladins will usually get a group to tank.<br />
<br />
I grant that Warriors are even more hosed in this regard though.  If a group won't take a Paladin for their secondary functionality, they sure as hell aren't going to want a Warrior for theirs since our secondary functionality is even more limited and has even less flexibility.  Just about every class in the game with very few exceptions can do better at our secondary functionality, DPS.<br />
<br />
Which leaves us right back where we started.  While both classes can do other things, in a limited fashion.  And Paladins can do far more in the secondary area than a Warrior.  Neither are likely to be given a group slot for those secondary functions if there is another class available that can do them better.  People use Paladins and Warriors as tanks.  Giving either class a clear superiority in any combination of the tanking attributes, avoiding damage, reducing damage (via spells), mitigating damage, ability to take damage, and ability to hold the attention of the mob while doing it, is going to mean that one or the other is 'preferred'.<br />
<br />
Personally, I believe that right now, once the difference in aggro generation is removed, the two classes run neck and neck in their ability to perform all the other tank functionalities.  But, OMG, Paladins will climb out of the woodwork swearing up and down, left and right, that is just isn't true.  And OMG you have defensive!  Which of course is a big deal, if you're raiding.  And means next to nothing if you're not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valeris</div><div class="date">08-07-2003, 08:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fact remains that every night there are a lot of exp groups working just fine with knights and warriors grouped together -  the only problem is the class that is least specialised around 'support tanking' end's up in the support role.... apart, it has to be said, for the knights that are more comfortable playing the role they were designed toward and sit back and assist the warrior in tanking. But boy does it piss one off to be allowed to tank on sufference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">08-08-2003, 05:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No one ever takes a Paladin for his utilities unless you're doing something extremely difficult.  He's sort of nice when you're lazy and don't feel like finding someone (or someone's bot) to get Virtue while running with a druid healer but if you're actually doing anything difficult, you would never start with a druid healer and get a Paladin to symbol.  Just doesn't work that way.<br />
<br />
The only thing Paladin brings to a typical safe XP group is his aggro.  But then that's like saying the only thing a Wizard brings to a group is DPS.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikos</div><div class="date">08-08-2003, 06:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Both Paladins and Warriors can both be invited as MT of group. <br />
Int Caster(Ench, Wiz, Necro, Mage) oriented groups most of the time preffer a Paladin over a Warrior. Those casters cant tank a mob for more than 2-3 rounds of attacks without entering the low hp aggro zone.   It is common for casters to reach the low hp aggro mark and die before a warrior regains the mob's attention via succesful LUCKY taunt or LUCKY proc.  With a Paladin, this is never an issue due to their total aggro control and he can actually save a caster in the low hp aggro zone with a quick heal. <br />
<br />
<br />
Paladins CAN be invited to a group that has Druid/Shaman Healer for his ability to REZ in case things go wrong. The Druid/Shammy heals can be sufficient in pretty much any EXP camp at PoV/CoD/BoT/HoH/PoTactics/PoTorment/SolRo/PoNB. Instead of getting a cleric for the Oh-shit-moments(Bad pull, Trains, LDs), you take a Paladin. Better DPS than a Cleric.  <br />
Even when I am tank, if the only healer aviable is a druid, and a paladin is around, I invite him. Usually when you need a rez, you cant seem to find a cleric that can come to your camp and rez the fallen. Sometimes if there IS a cleric in the zone he just cant reach the camp or is busy. The security of having a paladin for emergency rezes is very welcome indeed. Specially if it means not having to abandon camp to rez someone at GY. There are exp sessions where all is perfect and no one dies. But shit happens, I am not the only one that like to have a rezzer in group for those rare bad moments.   <br />
<br />
Warriors can't get invited for that reason. <br />
<br />
Paladins with Slay Undead CAN be invited as DPS in exp camps that have undead (like HoH/PoV/CoD/PoNb). <br />
<br />
Warriors are NEVER invited for their DPS to undead camps. <br />
<br />
Warriors need to get lucky with procs and the taunt button to get/keep aggro. Exp groups need to hold back, lower their overall DPS to allow the warrior to tank. <br />
<br />
Paladins  have absolute control of aggro whenever they wish to have it. Group does not have to hold back. They can nuke, dot, slow without worries.  Pallies can take the hits just as good as any warrior in similar gear. <br />
<br />
<br />
The point of it all is that, Warriors are invited for the sole reason of tanking the mob and nothing else. Thats all they can be invited for.<br />
<br />
Paladins on the other hand, can be invited for tanking the mob AND other abilities a warrior does not have.</div></div><hr />

Imagine if I could get an item with Lifetap clicky!!!! that would be sweet wouldn't it?... but... it wouldnt get me groups!! So why the fuck should I be happy with such an effect?<br />

<br />
Who gives a damn if your Rez, Root, Nukes, Heals arent what is going to get you groups. What counts is you HAVE them, they're permanently in your posession.<br />
You started playing a Paladin to have those spells, and you have them.<br />
<br />
<br />
You want to be chosen in a group?? Then paladins go to undead areas, where people will adore you for your undead abilities...<br />
or SKs propose yourself as puller/Tanks, people will adore you for pulling and tanking!<br />

All warriors can propose is to Tank.. period..<br />

I group with people from my guild.<br />
<br />
The paladins from my guild are skilled.  They know how to maximize what they do in a group where they are not the MT. <br />
<br />
THE WHOLE PROBLEM is people not willing to accept less than the maximum amount of experience possible per hour.  I have more fun in a group of talented guildies that have a bad mix for optimal experience than a group where I am MT with a solid cleric, enchanter with mega-pet, and three rogues.<br />

I absolutely LOVE multiple tank groups. Having a warrior, SK, and paladin in one group and multi tanking is just fun damnit. The problem is that it is usually slower xp, so not many people are interested.<br />
<br />
My favorite group of all time was WAR, PAL (me), SK, SHM, BRD, DRU. With the druid and bard DS (we all had 8th ring too, I believe) it actually worked out pretty well as far as DPS is concerned. The shaman (my wife) would just use tigirs to slow and us 3 tanks would sort out our targets and go to town. Druid/shaman group regen rocked for our group. Group heals rocked for our group. Since we were splitting our DPS among 2-3 targets at a time, dots would last the full duration. Everyone got to use all of their skills to the fullest. I'm hoping that more people will be interested in those sorts of groups when LDoN rolls around.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly. <br />
<br />
If I'm in a pickup group and we have an empty slot that isn't one of the basics (slower, healer, tank) then generally I start looking for a DPS class. I'll ask a ranger, rogue, monk, wizard, mage, necro to join before I would ask another class to join. I'm guessing that's the way most people do things. If there is someone I know (and like ;) ) who is LFG, it doesn't matter what their class is. If there is someone in the group who wants to invite a friend of theirs, it doesn't matter what class they are, we are generally all fine with that. Friendships come before a slightly faster xp rate. But if it is Joe Stranger, most people are going to grab a DPS class first....or whatever class is going to best fill the percieved need of the group.</div></div><hr />

My last one was 4 warriors + paladin + cleric.  But I'm saying that if I am actually forming a group and I wish to optimize it somewhat, I would never get a Paladin for any of the reasons mentioned except aggro, unless I'm doing something particularly difficult where I feel the additional safety a Paladin brings via his other skills (which are extremely powerful, maybe even overpowered) is necessary.  But if I'm going to just grind out some XP in an easy zone, I certainly won't be getting a Paladin because he can root or buff or whatever.  It's for his aggro and aggro only.  His other abilities are of no use when you're just pulling singles that anyone can pull in PoValor or PoEarth.</div></div><hr />

Sure the dps drops because they're tank classes, but its kinda fun.  Having 1 tank and 5 casters just means you are  tanking 100% of the time.  If an add came then it would be all up for the kiter class to root/snare it, or the mezzing class to charm/mez it.  The roots, and mezzes are only trivial, having a tank to get on the adds is not, heals will always land where mezzes and roots might not.  And tanks arent immune to heals, like mezzes/roots are ;p.  Anyway, I like having multiple tanks as it kinda helps the tank classes as there are more tank classes LFG than others.  Just do a /lfg and youll notice over time that it has more tank classes LFG than any other, and since we cant solo, its not like we're gonna go kite mobs for xp while /lfg like the soloing classes do.</div></div><hr />

Why? I'm not really sure... I'm talking about looking at the clock every blue bubble of aa xp and seeing it take longer after the paladin insists that his aggro warrants he MTing. it could be things like, when the pally is casting, he is not swinging his windy...  chain casting stun to prove he can get aggro doesnt allow that axe to fall too often. <br />
<br />
...and I dont ever have to med. <br />
<br />
On the other hand, pallys in my guild rock. they /assist, take aggro if mob is on caster and my taunt fails (only to let me get it back 6 seconds later when taunt recycles) and they dont blow all their mana trying to MT, they save it to heal, or chain stun that add, etc... <br />
<br />
so who is the best XP group MT? sks probably :rolleyes: <br />

The last time I took a paladin in my group I was embarrassed at how much she SUCKED at playing this damn game, Kept overagroing me with stuns and then turning mobs on the pets - I finally gave up and said that she tanks now, suddenly she wasnt stunning all that often anymore (in begin of a fight), only when she lost agro.. however, it got her the agro back instantly so it didnt matter that much.

In such a situation you cannot do better than just having that one mob hit the tank 100% of the time.  <br />
<br />
Speaking of stuns, a couple days ago I saw a Wizard using Telekin and that spells looks more like how stun ought to work rather than the current free mana spamming chain stun stuff.  It stops the mob for a long time (8 seconds), does a good deal of damage (900), and uses a fair amount of mana (300).  If Telekin replaces Force of Akilae I think you'll solve most of the aggro problems (of course make stuns that can't effect mobs not aggro is needed too).  Yes I'm aware the 1 to 3 ratio nuke is better than any Hybrid nuke, so maybe the damage needs to be tuned down a little bit.  I think stuns should be high mana but mana efficiency nukes with long stuns for Paladins, that way they serve what they do (grab aggro/stop mob when it's needed) but not spammed, at least not for long.</div></div><hr />

Really?  I invite anyone to read through the thread and make their own determination as to whether or not I'm being disingenuous.  Note in particular that Romidar, one of the more influential Paladins appears to be in support of the idea.<br />

If Telekin replaces Force of Akilae I think you'll solve most of the aggro problems (of course make stuns that can't effect mobs not aggro is needed too).  Yes I'm aware the 1 to 3 ratio nuke is better than any Hybrid nuke, so maybe the damage needs to be tuned down a little bit.  I think stuns should be high mana but mana efficiency nukes with long stuns for Paladins, that way they serve what they do (grab aggro/stop mob when it's needed) but not spammed, at least not for long.  <br />
<br />
I disagree with this. I can see giving Paladins a long duration stun, but not a nuke of any kind. Of the hybrid classes, nukes are my classes play things, and paladins can go play with their heal spells for all I care. Paladins can already tank, do good damage and heal... They don't need direct damage on top of that.<br />
<br />
<br />
edit - They don't need a new pacify either. It's annoying to be trying to harmony a mob only to have someone get funny ideas of following me about to pacify it.</div></div><hr />

Sure there are, so why do Paladins need to be one of them?  It's much easier and attractive to have the tank also be the puller.  Giving Paladins pacification would mean they could pull and tank.   There goes any remains of a job for Monks.  There goes the need for a Cleric or an Enchanter to do it.  Even Shadow Knights will have their attraction reduced to a degree.  While Warrriors really get screwed.</div></div><hr />

Have you read this thread at all?  I made the point a couple of posts up that some Paladins are campaigning to have the higher level pacify spell in order to pacify mobs higher than 55.  I even included the link to PoN where they discuss it.  And now you are busting people chops because they can't currently pacify mobs over level 55?  Well no shit, the point is they want to be able and think they should be able to pacify mobs over level 55.</div></div><hr />

LDoN isn't out yet, but I'll get back to you in a bit on these spots with these great XP giving mobs in the NEW expansion, which of coruse will feature great XP spots as yet another way to entice the players to actually plunk down some coin and BUY the expansion.<br />

When LDoN XP rewards turn out to be better than PoP XP rewards ... then what?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">09-01-2003, 05:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't see how level 55 mobs can be anywhere near challenging for a level 65 groups if it's old world scale or even PoP scale.  Also, level 55 mobs give very little XP due to the level differential (or actually the bonus for fighting close level mobs).  For a group of level 65 to get better XP on level 55 mobs you'd need somewhere around a 300% ZEM which I find very unlikely.<br />
<br />
And if you're talking about people who are not 65, that's a whole different issue.  <br />
<br />
Find something more worthwhile to complain about.  Paladin in general are overpowered, but the level 55 pacify is not one of them.</div></div><hr />

You're missing the point. The pacifism is THERE. It's part of the UTILITY. Paladins complain that their UTILITY isn't VALUABLE.<br />
<br />
It's part of the utility and HAS value.<br />

It just adds to the overpowering nature of paladins being one of the penulitimate dungeon crawling tanks in the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Pacify issue is being a bit overblown here.  Up until level 60, a Paladin can use Pacify to pull singles in most experience camps they fight in.  After level 60, Pacify won't work on the mobs that give the best experience (you get the best experience from mobs within 5 levels of you).  By the time you are 65, Pacify is not a factor in our group-ability.<br />
<br />
Up until 60th level, Warriors do ok compared to Paladins, so the extra utility of Pacify is not as much an issue as it would be for higher level Paladins.  From 61 – 65 Pacify can be used by a Paladin who is 'bottom-feeding' by grouping to fight lower content.  A Paladin would have more than enough HP/AC to outright tank in those camps anyway, so there would be little reason to require a Warrior tank for that group.  <br />
<br />
Regarding the Paladins of Norrath thread about Pacify, some Paladins (including some influential ones) argue for being able to Pacify mobs up to 60th level, and a couple people advocate getting Pacification.  There is certainly NOT a consensus that we should get either of those abilities.  Back in the day, Pacify was downright dangerous to use.  It was resisted most of the time, and aggrod the mobs on failure.  Since it has been 'fixed' it works too well, making single pulls trivial in a lot of areas.  While I would dearly love to have an improved Pacify, I do not advocate improving Pacify for Paladins.<br />

My issue with pacify is clearly related to pulling and be able to safely pull singles.<br />

I wonder why I would would be concerned about that?</div></div><hr />

Well, my concern is if you give Paladins the more effective pacify you've given people one more reason not to want a Warrior and eliminated pretty much any need for a Monk, even as merely a convenience (when an Enchanter or Cleric perfers not to pull).</div></div><hr />

Which would make BOTH the characters I play useless.<br />
