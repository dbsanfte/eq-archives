For me its been silverpine and the barrons til 20, horde.</div></div><hr />

I was out of them for a while--but the chain seems to have restated as of 42.<br />
<br />
Did all of Brill, think I did most of  Silverpine (excepting the elites), Hillsbard (where the quest chains are nice a long--though there obviously some incomplete quest chains for Dalamar--or who ever the people in the bubble are--which is a shame as it seemed like an interesting story). <br />
<br />
I have also liked the quests given by the 2 trolls by the caudron in Stranglethorn--though one of the lines seems to have just ended abruptly. As there are even higher level trolls in the zone where I was sent, I suspect its another uncompleted chain.<br />
<br />
Seems like there are enough major chains that I can level an alt or 2 and not repeat too many of  the quests, which I like.</div></div><hr />

Change it up with some Arathi Highlands too.<br />
<br />
oh and shimmering flats in thousand needles is awesome for around 30-35 especially if you like those monster killing/monster drop quests. great time to solo. not that many gankers there either-- at least not in my server.<br />

btw, im horde.</div></div><hr />

But you kind of grind when you do quests.  This is for Alliance.  Here's what I think I did, hehe a bit hard to remember now.<br />
<br />
1-10 Elwynn Forest<br />
10-20ish Westfall, some Redridge<br />
20-30 Redridge, Duskwood, and a TON of stuff in Wetlands<br />
30-40 Duskwood,  Arathi Highlands, Hillsbrand/Alterac, Desolace, Stranglethorn <br />
<br />
40-45 Stranglethorn continued (there are a million quests there), finished up a lot of quests in all regions, starting lots of the Tanaris quests, as well as lots of the ones in Badlands and Uldaman.  Also got a few quests in the Hinterlands<br />
<br />
As far as instances I started doing Deadmines around 20 or so, Stockade mid to high 20s, Scarlet Monestary, mid to high 30s, Uldaman low 40s, and Zul Farrak now at mid 40s.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Most of these have been confirmed to be good, but in order to prevent overcrowding in areas I will try to list several different places, all of which should be pretty decent. More often than not, the areas will only hold one or two people maximum as far as spawn rates go - any more than that and you have too many people and too little mobs to support them. Unfortunately, because of this, you might end up somewhere that isn't quite as good as you might've hoped, and if that's the case, I apologize in advance.<br />
<br />
The levels are approximate, you may or may not have to supplement grinding for one or two levels in order to move onto the next zones early on, although most of the later parts deal mostly with areas to grind in. Also, when a level is listed next to a grind area, that means this is the level at which you can more than likely *start* grinding the mobs. You can probably *stop* grinding them about 4-5 levels past where the start level is. In fact, it's probably recommended that you do stop 4 levels past them. <br />
<br />
Also, keep in mind that this is mostly for Alliance players, as it's the only faction I've played and thus have no experience with Horde lands. You'll also note the lack of Kalimdor lands up until Feralas/Tanaris. While I'm not saying Ashenvale, Stonetalon Mountains, Thousand Needles or Desolace are bad places, I honestly have no experience with them either, and these areas that I do list are typically sufficient to take you up in levels.<br />
<br />
Please note that the level listed beside a place, if there is one, is the level recommended to *begin* the place. Each place should typically be able to last you for 4-5 levels (with the exception of quest areas), whether you have the patience to stay at that one place for that long is another thing.<br />
<br />
Level 1-12:<br />
- Newbie Zone :: You may have to leave at level 11.<br />
<br />
Level 12-20:<br />
- Westfall [Sentinel Hill, Westfall Lighthouse]<br />
- Loch Modan [Thelsamar, Farstrider's Lodge, Stonewrought Dam]<br />
- Darkshore [Auberdine]<br />
- Elite Area: Mo'grosh mound (Loch Modan)<br />
- Instance: Deadmines<br />
<br />
Complete the easiest quests in the first area that you go to (Night Elves should visit Darkshore first, Dwarves/Gnomes should visit Loch Modan first, Humans should visit Westfall first.) Move onto the next zone, and do the same, but this time you can complete more of the zone. Leave the most difficult, unless you can get a group for them - don't waste too much time on it, though. Move onto the last zone and complete all, or nearly all of the quests available in that zone. By this time, you should be about level 17-18. Go back to the first zone, and complete the rest of the quests there.<br />
<br />
Typically, my &quot;first zone&quot; is Westfall, in which case you can go back when you are done with both Loch Modan and Darkshore, and finish the Van Cleef line of quests and be at a good level to run the instance.<br />
<br />
Level 20-22:<br />
- Redridge Mountains [Lakeshire, Tower of Azora in Elwynn]<br />
<br />
Again, do the easy quests in Redridge, which should take you up to level 21 or 22. Skip the more difficult quests unless you have a group for them. I'd skip the entire Stonewatch Keep area of quests just simply because that entire area itself is crap.<br />
<br />
Level 22-30:<br />
- Redridge Mountains [Lakeshire, Tower of Azora in Elwynn]<br />
- Duskwood [Darkshire, Sven's Camp, Abercrombie]<br />
- Wetlands [Menethil Harbor, Greenwarden, N. Loch Modan (The Algaz Gauntlet)]<br />
- Ashenvale [Astranaar ?]<br />
- Stonetalon Mountains [?]<br />
- Elite Area: Dun Modr (Wetlands)<br />
- Instance: The Stockades<br />
- Instance: Shadowfang Keep<br />
- Instance: Blackfathom Deeps<br />
- Happy Loot: Naraxis' Fang (Duskwood)<br />
- Happy Loot: Tiny Crimson Whelpling (Wetlands)<br />
- Grind Area [26]: Dragonmaw Encampment (Wetlands)<br />
- Grind Area [26]: Whelgar's Excavation Site (Wetlands)<br />
- Grind Area [28]: Rotting Orchard (Duskwood)<br />
- Grind Area [28]: Raven Hill Cemetary (Duskwood)<br />
<br />
Preparation: Purchase Bronze Tube.<br />
<br />
Start at either Duskwood or Wetlands. This is where &quot;quest stacking&quot; can come in really handy if you want to be efficient. There are many, many quests that send you to the same areas, and if you get all of the quests at once, you can knock all of them out without having to run back and forth. Considering Wetlands and Duskwood are fairly bad for having their towns on one side of the map and the quest mobs/areas on the other side, this saves a lot of time. A lot of these are parts of quest chains, so honestly it's hard to know if you don't have prior knowledge or do a lot of quest research beforehand - so don't worry about it too much, but try to be as efficient as you can. Once you finish one of the two new areas, you should be about level 25 and can go finish the harder parts of Redridge, and then finish the last zone.<br />
<br />
Note for Stockades : There are 6 quests you can obtain for this instance. Lakeshire, Darkshire, Wetlands, Van Cleef note continuation (Bazil Thredd), and two from Stormwind.<br />
<br />
Level 31-37:<br />
- Stranglethorn Vale [Rebel Camp, Nesingwary's Expedition, Booty Bay]<br />
- Hillsbrad Foothills [Southshore]<br />
- Arathi Highlands [Refuge Pointe]<br />
- Desolace [32]<br />
- Thousand Needles [31]<br />
- Instance: Gnomeregan<br />
- Happy Loot: Howling Blade (Skhowl, Alterac Mountains)<br />
- Happy Loot: Toxic Revenger (Gnomeregan)<br />
- Happy Loot: Tiny Emerald Whelpling (Swamp of Sorrows)<br />
- Grind Area [31]: Kurzen Encampment [!NOTE!] (Stranglethorn Vale) -- [Test needed]<br />
- Grind Area [33]: Stranglethorn Raptors (Stranglethorn Vale)<br />
- Grind Area [33]: Growless Cave (Alterac Mountains)<br />
- Grind Area [34]: Gallow's Corner (Crushridge Ogres - Altarac Mountains)<br />
<br />
Preparation: Purchase all 15 pages of The Green Hills of Stranglethorn, 4 Bloodstone Ore.<br />
<br />
Start at Stranglethorn Vale. Quest stacking here is also godly, since you don't want to have to run all the way to the northern end of the zone, do one or two quests and turn them back in at Booty Bay. Rebel Camp's quests are largely independent of the rest, though, so you can do those first. Then, head to Booty Bay, where you can pick up two main quests for the northern area: Investigate the Camp and the start of the Excelsior chain, both of which takes you to Nesingwary's Expedition, where you obtain all of the nice happy quests there.<br />
<br />
Hillsbrad is only good starting at about level 33, at which point you can actually *do* all of the quests that you could obtain at level 30... Arathi only has one or two quests that you can actually do right now, but it's listed anyways.<br />
<br />
Kurzen Cave has been fixed, which perhaps means that Jungle Fighters and Headshrinkers have as well, so someone test that out please.<br />
<br />
Level 37-43:<br />
- Stranglethorn Vale [Booty Bay, Nesingwary's Expedition, Rebel Camp]<br />
- Arathi Mountains [Refuge Pointe, Faldir's Cove]<br />
- Badlands [Various camps around the zone]<br />
- Desolace [37]<br />
- Elite Area: Stromgarde<br />
- Elite Area: Mosh'ogg Mound<br />
- Instance: Scarlet Monastery<br />
- Instance: Uldaman<br />
- Instance: Razorfen Downs<br />
- Happy Loot: Tiny Black Whelpling (Badlands)<br />
- Grind Area [37]: Lashtail Raptors (Stranglethorn Vale)<br />
- Grind Area [37]: Water Elementals (Stranglethorn Vale)<br />
- Grind Area [39]: Rock Elementals (Badlands)<br />
- Grind Area [41]: Scalding Whelps (Badlands)<br />
- Grind Area [43]: Naga Explorers (Stranglethorn Vale)<br />
<br />
Preparation: Purchase 9 Blue Pearls, 1 Frost Oil, 1 Gyrochronatom, 4 Buzzard Wings, 1 Elixir of Water Breathing.<br />
<br />
37 is where you obtain your next batch of quests from Stranglethorn Vale. Arathi Highlands has fairly decent quests in Faldir's Cove, or if you're feeling group-friendly, knock out the ones in Stromgarde. Badlands has a lot of nice quests, but you have to actually find them. This is where supplementing experience by grinding becomes more efficient at times, and at 42-43 you should be closing the last of your Stranglethorn quests, and be finished with Badlands and Arathi both, as well.<br />
<br />
Scarlet Monastery. Black Menace or Sword of Serenity. Nothing more needs to be said - except where to obtain the quest: Desolace.<br />
<br />
Level 43-46:<br />
- Feralas [Feathermoon Stronghold]<br />
- Tanaris [Gadgetzan, Steamwheedle Port]<br />
- Instance: Zul'Farrak<br />
- Grind Area [43]: Wastewander Bandits (Tanaris)<br />
- Grind Area [44]: Isle of Dread (Feralas - Inside Cave; South of Feathermoon Stronghold)<br />
- Grind Area [45]: Feral Scar Vale (Feralas)<br />
- Happy Loot: 14slot bag! Cortello's Riddle quest, starts in one of the ships in Stranglethorn Vale for the end of the Bloodsail Buccaneers line of quests.<br />
<br />
Fairly self explanatory, I guess. Not much going on here, really.<br />
<br />
Level 46-50:<br />
- Tanaris [Gadgetzan, Steamwheedle Port]<br />
- The Hinterlands [Aerie Peak]<br />
- Instance: Zul'Farrak<br />
- Instance: Maraudon [49]<br />
- Instance: Temple of Atal'Hakkar [50]<br />
- Grind Area [47]: Dunemaul Compound (Tanaris)<br />
<br />
At this point, you more than likely have a bunch of quests saved up for The Hinterlands - including but not limited to, the quest to gather Wildkin Feathers (from Rutheran Village), the quest to obtain a snapshot of Gammerita, the quest to obtain Violet Trajan, the last part of Cortello's Riddle, etc. Feel free to knock them all out at once.<br />
<br />
Level 50-55:<br />
- Searing Gorge [Kalaran Windblade]<br />
- Blasted Lands [Blood Elf camp]<br />
- Un'Goro Crater [Marshal's Refuge]<br />
- Felwood [Emerald Sanctuary]<br />
- Burning Steppes [Morgan's Vigil]<br />
- Instance: Temple of Atal'Hakkar<br />
- Grind Aarea [52]: Dreadmaul Rock (Firegut Ogres - Burning Steppes)<br />
- Grind Area [52]: Ruins of Eldarath, Legash Encampment, Thalassian Base Camp, Ursolan (Azshara)<br />
- Grind Area [52]: Jaedenar, Deadwood Village (Felwood)<br />
- Grind Area [52]: Sorrow Hill (Western Plaguelands)<br />
- Grind Area [54]: Temple of Arkkoran (Azshara)<br />
- Grind Area [55]: Jadefire Run, Felpaw Village (Felwood)<br />
<br />
The quests in Blasted Lands all stack on top of each other. Five in total, one for each stat; they give 4700 experience per turn-in, along with always the chance of obtaining a Draenethyst Sphere for Kumi'sha the Collector with every mob you kill. Un'Goro Crater has the biggest collection of quests out of all of these zones.<br />
<br />
Level 55-60:<br />
- Winterspring [Everlook, Starfall Village]<br />
- Western Plaguelands [Chillwind Point]<br />
- Eastern Plaguelands [Light's Hope Chapel]<br />
- Instance: Blackrock Depths<br />
- Instance: Blackrock Spire [60]<br />
- Instance: Stratholme [60]<br />
- Instance: Scholomance [60]<br />
- Grind Area [55]: Felstone Field, Dalson's Tears, The Writhing Haunt, Gahrron's Withering (Western Plaguelands)<br />
- Grind Area [56]: Northridge Lumber Camp (Western Plaguelands)<br />
- Grind Area [56]: Corin's Crossing (Eastern Plaguelands)<br />
- Grind Area [56]: The Pillar of Ash (Burning Steppes)<br />
- Grind Area [56]: Winterfall Village (Winterspring)<br />
- Grind Area [57]: Blackrock Stronghold (Burning Steppes) [NOTE]<br />
- Grind Area [57]: Ice Thistle Hills (Wintespring) [NOTE]<br />
<br />
Notes: Blackrock Stronghold is probably the best place to grind for a rogue; however, you do have to get used to how the roamers work. You'll probably die a few times along the way while learning them. Also, this might likely be another area where they're increasing the armor on the mobs, but two of the four kinds of orcs that spawn are casters, anyway. Ice Thistle Hills is not the best place to grind for experience, but it's probably one of the better places to get a nice quiet grind going and also leave with a few backpacks full of Rugged Leather.<br />
<br />
Okay -- So this isn't really a &quot;complete&quot; grind area list, because honestly, you only have to sit down and grind at one or two places for a few levels before you can move onto the next tier of zones, and that's typically what I did. Just sit down and grind at one place, don't move around everywhere and you'll be out of there in a few hours or days. I've tried my best to list the best quest areas and zones as well for those that would rather try to quest and not grind their way through the game, too, but that's also somewhat incomplete, especially at later stages since I don't have much knowledge of the various new quests they implemented in Winterspring and the Plaguelands.<br />
<br />
Anyway, hope it helps to answer some of the &quot;where can I go at level X?&quot; questions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I guess I don't understand this question at all, because the game clearly tells you where to go.  If you're paying any attention at all, you don't need a &quot;Road Map.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Elite mobs have a LOT more hps, hit a lot harder, and are just generally harder to kill.  They also give double the exp a regular mob will do.  You can solo regular mobs your lvl any day of the week, but you won't be able to solo elites without breaking a sweat.  Instances mobs are all elites with Elite bosses too.  Hogger is an elite boss.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikken</div><div class="date">01-05-2005, 06:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah..that's called &quot;replay value,&quot; so you can start a twink and not think &quot;Wow, been here, done that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yeah, it's great to be able to do different stuff by starting a different race than one you've tried before. Start a human, and you get the Elwyn&gt;Westfall&gt;Redridge/duskwood area and quest progression,  but when you start a night elf, you get dolomar?&gt;darkshore&gt;wetlands. At least, thats how it was in late beta. The different area make leveling a different character, even on the same side, much different. In EQ2 the progression is the same for all races on the same side. the only way to get a different beginning is to start a different alignment character.<br />
<br />
More on topic, Loch Modan is a goldmine, at least last time I did the quests there during the stresstests. Darkshore quests were lacking and had problems. Some were broken, but mostly undercon quests or overly difficult quests. However, there is a very good quest from a gnome at the inn there that was quite entertaining. I'd recommend anyone to do that quests, it was hillarious. I hated wetlands, thats a personal preference though. Westfall and duskwood are very good if you haven't done those quests, and the drops weren't too bad in duskwood although I understand that there was an item revamp beofre release so that may have changed things. Though it may only b my impression, the item stats seems to have been toned down a bunch from beta, noticably the quest rewards in elwyn which only have ac now. I could be smoking something, but I could swear they had stats on them before. Its no biggy though as gear is so passing at the low levels, you really haven't need to worry about weak slots because upgrades come so fast.<br />
<br />
I do have to emphasis that most of this information comes from when I played the stress test beta, the first open one that is. There looks to have been a lot of changes made since then, and mostly for the better. Item stats seems to have much more meaning in WoW than EQ2 where stats are given out like candy. But their item system makes it work I guess.</div></div><hr />

If you're paying any attention at all, you don't need a &quot;Road Map.&quot;<br />
<br />
If you only go where the game leads you, you are missing out on a shit load of content.<br />
<br />
Some of the best areas I've been too came without a &quot;lead-in&quot; quest.  For instance, I didn't have any introductory quests into Stranglethorn Vale, I just decided I wanted to know what was dear Duskwood (or Dustwood or Darkwood or whatever); never had an introductory quest into Desolace.  Same with Uldaman, Kraul, Shadowfang.   I'm sure such lead-in quests exist somewhere out there, but in the way I progressed I didn't come across them and I'm damn glad I didn't wait for them to knock me across the head and allow me to droolingly play paint with numbers to the next path...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">01-07-2005, 08:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I didn't have any introductory quests into Stranglethorn Vale, I just decided I wanted to know what was dear Duskwood (or Dustwood or Darkwood or whatever); never had an introductory quest into Desolace. Same with Uldaman, Kraul, Shadowfang. <br />
<br />
You probably missed them then.<br />
<br />
Shadowfang is standard fare for Horde (likely not for Alliance, since it's pretty balls deep in Horde territory, but we are told from the get go that we're heading there).<br />
<br />
Stranglethorn Vale comes to the Horde via being told to talk to Nesingwary from a guy in Desolace, or from doing anything that takes you to Booty Bay, or just by hopping on the zepplin and landing in Grom Gol.<br />
<br />
I did get a desolace quest.  I can't remember from where, but I was definitely quested into the zone.<br />
<br />
Patrick Garret in the Undercity tells us to go to Uldaman.<br />
<br />
Razorfen Kraul quests come from Auld Stonespire in Thunder Bluff, and from the Apothecary in the undercity.  <br />
<br />
Given how much more 'polish' is on the Alliance side than the Horde side, I'm guessing you missed them.  There are indeed quests to go almost everywhere...the problem is that if you've already spoken to the person you're being sent to, you won't get the quest.  Example -- I went to Arathi at like 30 or so, talked to everyone in Hammerfall.  Later on I went to Grom'Gol and did some quests.  In the process of doing so, I abandoned a few Hammerfall quests, and immediately a troll lit up with an exclamation point.  I ran over and talked to him, and sure as shit, he's sending me to Hammerfall.<br />
<br />
I can't tell ya where Alliance stuff is, but I can tell you that if you keep your eyes open, you're definitely told of 2-3 different areas you can go at any one level on the Horde side...and that's only from the places I've been.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">01-07-2005, 10:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Instances don't really have a 'report to soandso in area X' lead in quest, but it's pretty hard to not get any quest to any instance of your side just from talking to everyone with a ! on their head.  For the areas, virtually every area has a 'report to soandso in area X' quest if you look hard enough, and really, even if you miss that quest, the game follows a pretty standard RPG fare where the area 1 zone further away from your current zone (relative to home areas) is usually 1 tier uberer than the one before.  It's not hard to deduce where you're supposed to go next.<br />
<br />
The only instance I can think of that you might miss would be Scarlet Monastery on the horde side since the main quest is in the royal chamber in UC (not somewhere you go to often) and I think all the other quests have prereqs you might miss (like one requires RFK).  But if you ever did any of the Undead newbie quests, you should at least know this dungeon exists.<br />
<br />
Desolace was a standard 'we need more people fighting in this zone (and every other zone in the game), go report to soandso' quest.  I can't remember who gave the quest either, but it wasn't anything obscure.</div></div><hr />

Maybe you don't, but everyone who's playing Undead and has played WC3 sure as fuck goes back to the Royal Chamber every level to see if Varimathras and Sylvanas have anything cool to do. :p</div></div><hr />

The reward was a really nice weapon and you also open up a little ring event once all 4 of the leaders are dead.<br />
<br />
I knew when I got to the first boss in Ragefire and got grav fluxed into the lava this was gonna be a fun game.  Running through the WC quests/events sealed it for me.<br />
<br />
So far most of the lower level instances have had some sort of scripted event with in the zone along with a quest progression that causes you to enable the event (at the very least) or makes you go through it.  I kinda quit exploring the completness of the instances long about the RFK level.<br />
<br />
Neat thing is I can always go back and do it... or better yet help some friends through who are of the level.  The WoW version of a PL =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
The point is not whether I missed quests.   But I can fucking confirm that I didn't miss any quest for Shadowfang or Kraul.  <br />
<br />
The point is that there was zero reason to go flaming someone for asking folks where they choose to hunt at certain levels.<br />
<br />
In my 20s I went from Westfall to Redridge to Deadmines to Duskwood to Loch Modan to Barrens to Shadowfang to Stockades, primarily.  I know people who stayed pretty much on the Ashenvale side of things because they started out elf, stayed in Darkshore and their &quot;go see&quot; quests lead them right down south to Ashenvale ... where they stayed.  I don't believe I got a SINGLE quest leading me to Ashenvale staying on my little side of the universe and I also don't believe I missed the almighty exclamation point.<br />
<br />
But even if I did it's still a valid question to ask, essentially, which areas are better.  I knew Ashenvale existed, of course I did as I am a Night Elf, but I think the experiences I got travelling to all those areas in my 20s were richer and better than had I stayed in Ashenvale the whole time.   As a general rule there are so many quests for all over the globe that we simply cannot complete them all within the right level range so some folks prioritize and in doing so they ask others what areas they feel are best.</div></div><hr />

The zones themselves even follows the same pattern I speak of.  If stuff around town is level X, then go Y distance out and it'd be X+1, go 2Y distance from town and it'd be X+2, and so on.  Very easy to tell where you should be going just based on proximity.</div></div><hr />

While largely true, I can think of 2 spots where its a lil different... not by much though.  The Booty Bay/STV area has a road with level 30's on one side of it and level 40's on the other.  The other is RFK vs RFD area where its mid 20's mobs on one side and mid 30's on the other.  I kinda like those spots.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
That is simply inaccurate.  I could fill in my entire map of Westfall and Redridge, the two most-commonly Alliance traversed zones through the 20s, and not get a single quest for Kraul or Shadowfang (or WC or Ashenvale or any other number of places).  What I will get is a bunch of quests for those zones, a bunch of quests taking me to Stockades or other specific NPCs in Stormwind, a bunch of quests in Duskwood and maybe a few in Wetlands or Loch Modan.  <br />
<br />
 I would never suggest to someone to do that in order to make sure you catch everything.  Sure, fill in your map for other reasons.  But if you want to see everything and experience it when it should be experienced, you are going to have to go outside the box a bit.</div></div><hr />

So, lets try this again.  Did you miss them?  Yes.  Is it due to you being lazy or blind?  No.  It's due to you not having a paladin or a warrior I'm guessing, since you definitely would have found both quests if you did.   Everyone class might not be required to go to every zone, but if you've got a bunch of friends playing, and you're comparing notes, you should definitely be hearing things like &quot;Uhh, it says here I gotta go to some place called Shadowfang Keep...we should try to find that.&quot;<br />

I don't get why people bitch so much about saving money for a mount. If you do most of your city's quests, you can probably be the level after honored by the time you hit 40, which I assume gets your mount to about, let's say 90 gold. That's still not a terribly large amount of money to raise if you farm humanoids, or you're smart and picked a tradeskill that makes megabucks, like mining/skinning!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lemme guess, you're alliance, aren't you?<br />
<br />
First things first.  Humanoids =/= more money.  Just because you click on a little coin icon every kill doesn't mean you make more when things like the soft tails off tigers that you get every 4th kill sell for 8s6c.  Secondly, level up a horde character.  I'm not complaining or anything, but Horde quest rewards have A LOT less pure cash involved than alliance.  You basically need to do quests for Ratchet or Booty Bay or Gadgetzan if you want money on the Horde side, cuz you ain't getting dick for doing quests.  It was fairly easy for me to see on my level 5 warlock on a PvP server that he had roughly double the cash on hand as my warlock on Horde on Hellscream.<br />

And with mith going for 6-12g a stack I am not likely to make a lot of gold on it soon either <br />

<br />
So, lets try this again.  Did you miss them?  Yes. <br />
<br />
<br />
What exactly is this responsive to?  I posted, to be clear, &quot;I can fucking confirm that I didn't miss any quest for Shadowfang or Kraul.&quot;  Your research only confirms it further.  As you pointed out, those quests are for classes that, um, I am not.  So I didn't miss those quests.  There is no possible fucking way in the world that I, alone, could ever have gotten those quests (furthermore, there is no way I could ever complete those quests, even with questshare with the right classes). <br />
<br />
I'm not being insulting.  The game does indeed spell out places for you to go, you just need to keep your eyes open and you'll find them.<br />
<br />
You were being insulting, just not to me.  You came waltzing into this thread telling everyone there was no point in discussing it because the game tells us where to go.  The point of the two examples I used was that, no, the game doesn't spell out places for ME to go.   My only chance would be to rely on other people, of other classes, who may or may not get quests to go out to these locations...Give me a break.  <br />
<br />
If I'm going to rely on other people, or &quot;keep my eyes open&quot; as you suggest, why do it in game?  Why not also, oh, I dunno, not be condescending in this thread and listen to folks' suggestions here instead of randomly coming across the right class in the game who happens to have picked up this quest on their own?  Whether I listen to people gabbing about their individual quests in game or I listen to it here, there is zero difference.  The bottom line is that the game would never have led me to certain places and I learn about them from others.<br />
<br />
If you do quests in Selpucher you will get quests for Shadowfang. For the Kraul, I'm sure some guy on the Barrens somewhere wants you to do something in it. <br />
<br />
Phan, you must have me confused with someone in the horde.  If you think an alliance would be wandering around Selpucher or the Barrens in the 20s actually doing quests that the game led them to, you clearly aren't playing an alliance character.  The only reason I ever saw the Barrens in my 20s is because Raaj recommended during Beta that Wailing Caverns was a lower-level instance than Deadmines that I might try...so I did research on Thotbott for how to get my ass over there (traversing a 30+ Dustwallow Marsh zone) and tried it.  I think hearing suggestions from others on this thread and others are invaluable for enriching our gaming experiences.  The game may be great, but it doesn't handhold everything.</div></div><hr />

Sure, they had it difficult because of the absolute shit sucking or lack of quests early in beta, but both leveling trees are about as even as they can get. <br />
<br />
And it's pretty common knowledge that it's not just the cash on humanoids that's good. They happen to drop those little things called weapons that sell for a decent chunk of change, plus cloth that you can dump in the AH, PLUS they have schematics that can sell well also. So that little 6 silver you get about every 4th kill &lt; the average of 1 silver, 15 copper, plus pickpocket items (if you're a rogue), plus the cloth I get 3/4ths of the time, plus either a grey weapon that sells for about 10 silver or a green item that sells for about 20-25 silver, plus the food so I don't have to buy food at an inn. The only reason to really farm beasts is if you're a skinner, and the raptors in STV, because they drop medium leather. That's honestly the only time I'd say that farming beast &gt; farming humanoids.<br />
<br />
(For reference, I can dump a stack of Wool Cloth in the AH for about 40-50 silver, silk cloth for 50-60 silver, and linen for about 20-30. Medium Leather goes for about 10-15 silver for 10.)<br />

Vig, seriously, chill the fuck out.  What are you doing in an instance without a group? Jack fucking shit.  Does there need to be a quest for every class in the game taking you to every instance?  No...because if you have a guild or a group of friends spread out amongst some classes, one of you is going to get a quest to go somewhere and you don't all need to have it to know the dungeon exists.  The point is that a group of Alliance (Which is likely Paladin, Paladin, Warrior, Druid, Warlock, from what I've fuckin seen), WOULD have found their way to RFK and SFK just fucking fine.   If you disagree, fine, but it's not like there's not a goddamned glowing yellow exclamation point leading your faction to these zones or anything.<br />

That is besides the point, at least if I understand what your point originally was.  I'm pretty sure it was something along the lines of:  You don't have to conduct research on areas to go or even discuss it because the game does all of that for you and leads you exactly where you want to go via quests.  Im pretty sure you've already conceded somewhere in all this argument that, in fact, we often need to listen to other people, if for nothing else than to hear about zones you otherwise wouldn't know of because they have quests there.  I add to that maybe read some threads on boards, and take a look at sites like Ally and Thotbott if we want to see all the content during the level in which we could best experience it. <br />
<br />
Now if that wasn't your point, then this entire discussion is rather useless as I simply pitched in purely out of exasperation when I read your post.  <br />
<br />
And in terms of answering the original question:<br />
<br />
I  am alliance and my leveling worked much like this:<br />
<br />
1-11 NE &amp; Darkshore<br />
12-20 Westfall, Redridge, Loch Modan, Deadmines, Wailing Caverns<br />
21-30 Redridge, Darkshire, Wetlands, Barrens, Razorfen Kraul, Stockades<br />
31-40 Stranglethorn Vale, Wetlands, Shimmering Flats, Gadgetzan, Desolace, Badlands, That-Area-North-of-Wetlands, Dustwallow Swamp, Gnomergan, SM, Uldaman<br />
<br />
I'm now 42 and finishing up the SV quests.  I plan to head to Arathi Highlands next and then probably back to Gadgetzan.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Vig, this is my point.<br />
<br />
I have a group of friends playing WoW, as you do.<br />
<br />
In my group, when we're all on, we sit down and say &quot;Okay, what are we gonna do today?&quot;  In our various travels, we compare quest logs and see what we have that looks interesting.  Invariably we come up with something like &quot;Well, I've gotta go to this Razorfen Kraul place...uhh, somewhere in the south barrens, wanna go there?&quot;  The reply is usually &quot;Sure, can you share the quest?&quot;  &quot;Uhh, nah, looks like XXXXXX only, but I should still finish it up because it looks like a phat reward.&quot;  And off to the Kraul we go.  <br />
<br />
Does everyone in my group need to have the quest in order to alert us to a zone that is probably appropriate for our level?  Absolutely not.  If we gotta head there for the warrior, or the shaman or whatever, we fuckin take a trip on down there.  This game clearly isn't meant to be played alone.  If you want to do that, then poking around places will net you directions to a few places that you can play alone.  If you have friends, they'll find even more places than you due to their class/quest status, and you'll ALL be able to go there, at least if you're any kind of friends at all.  Do you personally need to have a blinking sign telling you to go somewhere for you to go?  I don't...one of my friends blinking signs is good enough for me, and THAT is my point.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only quest that any one of my friends ever had that I couldn't pick up was the Pally weapon.  No one in my guild plays a warrior.  No one in my level-range plays a priest or a mage or a warlock.  And obviously we don't have any shamans (instead we have 3830103184548504040340 hunters).  Not a single person ever would have actually randomly obtained a quest in Kraul or Wailing Caverns without having done research on it first.   And we didn't go there to complete quests.  We went there just to SEE it.  We did WC without having obtained any quests because we just wanted to experience it.  I suspect the same thing for the Horde and Deadmines or Blackfathom Deep or Gnomergan. <br />
<br />
But, you know what?  You can experience content solely that you or your friends figure out by traversing the world.  I and others will talk about locations and do research outside the game.  At the end we'll compare notes.  ;)</div></div><hr />

As a smith there is no limit to the amount of Mith I can use, and that is without the Mithril order talking to me.

I pretty much do what Haass does.  Friends and I say what quests we have, what instances do ya wanna hit etc., then we go do something.  I've seen a TON more content than I ever would have alone.  A lot of times quests aren't shareable because they have pre-requirements.  (kill X amount of blah then you get step 2 which is go to uber instance_01 and do...whatever)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd check out any remaining higher level quests that may be worth it in Ashenvale.  I'd also recommend going north above Wetlands, including Arathi Highlands (Stromgarde Keep has some nice quests), Hillsbrad Foothills, Alterec Mnts. <br />
<br />
In a few levels you can hit of Desolace and Stranglethorn Vale - which keep you busy for a long time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ive seen much mention of Desolace, however Ive never been.  I picked up a quest to go there awhile back but never found the time.  Ive been splitting my time between Tarren Mill/Hillsbrad/Alterac and Hammerfell.  Im currently in Hammerfell but my quests there are Red/Orange.  Is Desolace a good place to build a couple more levels then come back to Hammerfell?<br />
<br />
Thanks folks.</div></div><hr />

If you're not adverse to grinding, the ogres at the Vul'Gol or whatever ogre mound are quite nice until about....32!</div></div><hr />

I don't care if you got quests to go there or not.  Doesn't change the fact that I didn't get quests to go to Wailing Caverns or Kraul or Shadowfang in the &quot;normal course of business.&quot; <br />

We actually lit all the laterns - figured it was required in order to open the door.  And then we all promptly died.</div></div><hr />

Still go to Desolace for the &quot;In the name of the light&quot; quest, which results in a win weapon for the level from SM!<br />
<br />
And ogres pretty much are the gimps. Half the time, they hit for LESS than their human counterparts, plus they often have less AC!</div></div><hr />

The &quot;light&quot; quest is important for SM, as someone mentioned, but there are probably a good 5-10 additional quests in Desolace and only three of them actually involve being underwater.  Of course I loved the zone also because half the shit there is skinnable.  Same with Stranglethorn, which is IMO the best low 30's to low 40's place to hunt.</div></div><hr />

u mean like killing sh*t without having a quest ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iskandar</div><div class="date">01-11-2005, 07:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can do SM in the mid 30s; just start with the rightmost instance and work your way left as you level. There's good drops for most classes. Doan drops a nice dagger/staff for casters, Herod drops a nice helm/shoulder for tanks as well as a 37 DPS 2h axe, Mograine drops a 1500 armor shield (in fact it's his most common drop by far) and a 39 DPS 2h mace, and Whitemane drops a very nice hat for casters/priests, a 30 DPS +healing mace, and an excellent amulet for casters, priests, and paladins.<br />
<br />
Pretty much everyone who's eligible should do In the Name of the Light. The prereqs are nothing, just a little running around to areas you should get gryph points to anyway. Last night in the final SM instance at 42 I was getting 110-160 exp per mob in a full group. When I solo in my chosen spot I get 200 exp per mob and obviously kill more slowly. Just make sure you kill Loksey in the library - a lot of people miss him. He's in the right wing as you enter the first courtyard, accompanied by three dogs.<br />
<br />
Also an NPC in the Ironforge Explorer's League offers Mythology of the Titans - find a book in the SM library instance and you get a 6 sta/spr necklace and some exp, not bad at all. The book isn't out of the way, it's in the bottom left corner of a room you enter.<br />
<br />
Additionally, when you do the final instance, don't forget the &quot;secret&quot; boss, an undead priest who drops several good green items. Once you get to the final cathedral with Mograine, check the room to the right of him, specifically a torch in the wall. If you can kill Mograine, you can kill Fairbanks easily.</div></div><hr />

BTW, thank you for all the info on Desolace.  I was there last night for a bit bunch of skinning (  :D  ) and such.  I think Ill do Into the Light and head to SV or back to Alterac.  Im getting bored with Desolace already.  I wasnt too impressed.  Made 35 though hehehe.<br />

Awesome, well I already have that one and I guess that means I can leave Desolace far far behind.  Though, I might wait until the skins grey out for me.  Most everything is green I can kill.  Skill at 256 I believe.  <br />

Bleh, we've killed him a number of times at this point and have yet to get the shield, which would be a significant upgrade for our tank so is the reason we keep trying - got the mace once.  The rest have been scarlet legs, mostly, and maybe a breastplace or something.</div></div><hr />

Clearly caster stats, and just marginally better than the Heavy Mithril Axe, so I'm still toying around with it.  I think it will end up being relegated to offhand for DW purposes (IE : fuckin rarely)</div></div><hr />
