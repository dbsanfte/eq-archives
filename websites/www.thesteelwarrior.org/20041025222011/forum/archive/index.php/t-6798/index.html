Wondering if it would be a resonable alternative to EoE offhand, dbotw primary. I seem to remember frostbite as being resonable agro, but I'm curious about the proc rate mostly. Also curious if the additional dps from the JOS would make up for the lower agro proc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My experience has been it has more aggro then Jesus.  But that's just me :)<br />
DBOW/JOS both augged with anger 3 consistantly takes aggro from DBOW/EoE both with anger 3, I have the former, 2 other warriors in guild have the latter, one of the two got a JoS after me and we all say the same.  Between consistant dps aggro and the debuff proc, it's the best offhand aggro weapon in the current game.</div></div><hr />

We price DBoW and JOS at 400 and EoE at 375pts<br />

(Ikkinz / Quarmish loot at ~500pts)<br />
<br />
In your point system i would take EOE if i was you, really not worth JOS beeing more than twice more expensive... JoS seem very over rated by your point system IMO</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sargeras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">For a while there, I was the only warrior to want a JOS. Although I was kinda disappointed to see the proc was a Velious one (it gets resisted alot), but it still generates great aggro. So much in fact that I was overaggroing our MT (but what else is new right guys?! :P). He and I are the only ones with DB's, and he looted the last JOS that dropped. He parsed that it was higher DPS than DB+Ethereal Destroyer (Saryn never coughs up EoE's when warriors want them &gt;&lt;).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Aonodorus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I use one in offhand, and have an EoE as well (JoS was rotting, so i just said what the hell why not).  It's a toss up really, the aggro on both is excellent.  They're both quality offhands, I guess it comes down to desireabilty and price.  If all your monks and bsts are fighting over the JoS, and it costs a bit more then an EoE, you may as well just take an EoE.  If the price difference is negligable, and you have the ability to get a JoS, hell why not~</div></div><hr />

 What weapon from Uqua?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Injektilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Someones been linking around a 30/19 ish 1 hander with a lifetap proc, i might be wrong on the ratio i only glanced at the link on a raid a couple days ago, im also assuming its form uqua and not mined outta the databasess heh.  But thats probably the weapon hes referring to.<br />
<br />
On the subject of the JOS.  If i already had an EOE ( which i do ) i wouldnt loot a JOS.  Maybe its because my guilds dkp and its not worth wasting points when my offhand is already a good weapon.  We have gotten 2 of the JOS, a ranger took one and the other rotted or went to someone with so few points it was the same difference.  Hasnt been much desire for it to be honest =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Ive been having this dilemma as well as i picked up a JoS recently. EoEs are soon at rot stage and if rallos is kind ill have a DBoW soon enough so it wont be a lot of problem for me to have all 3.<br />
<br />
The only disadvantage that i thought there may be in using the JoS - as the procs a debuff, doesnt that take up a debuff slot on the mob and if so, wont you be depriving casters of a valuable buff slot as opposed to the eoe's straight stun/dd.<br />
<br />
Admittedly on the looks front, i do prefer the EoE cos these things are important....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Celestias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Aranini's Rage- that was said to be 30/19 1h is actually 30/26 Note JoS is 29/25 but HAS +1 cold dmg, so I would say they are about equal ratio wise, the proc on that 1h (drops off one of the mini's in Uqua and dropped for us and almost rotted FYI) is a 150 lifetap(low aggro but pretty cool!) JoS is much more contested now for dps and aggro etc. plus is usable by more classes, and the 30/26 wep. Both are good weps, Aranini's Rage looks like the ranger weapon 29/23 one thats an elf boot, so much prefer sparkles of the staff to it :) just one opinion. BTW was parsed over 200dps with DB + JoS in LDoN over 4 adventures with no attack buffs if that helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">29/25 (JoS) is better ratio than 30/26 (Aranini's Rage) even without the +1 cold part.<br />
<br />
But the proc on Aranini's Rage is more DPS (150 lifetap resist versus 60 all or nothing cold).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>minet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">i would disagree that life tap is *suckass aggro&quot;*.<br />
granted its not a TRUE hate proc nor as good as a stun probly.<br />
but i would say it is better than any straight DD proc for aggro generation from my experience. i use a cudgel of wrecking and acrilya bladed broadsword both auged with 75 hp life taps for my dps set up. and when not tanking on AE DOT or AE DD bosses. <br />
<br />
undead mobs in particular i feal have a deep hate twords these procs. <br />
<br />
i use them for not tanking , but i have found myself catching alot of unintentional aggro with them verses wars with auged VDD and similiar.<br />
<br />
in line of aggro generations it would probly be something like <br />
<br />
1. pure hate<br />
2. rune<br />
3. stuns<br />
4. lifetaps<br />
5. dd<br />
6. dot<br />
<br />
i dont know where AC debuffs fall in line , as i have no first hand experiance.<br />
i feal it would fall somewhere from 3.5-4.5 range</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, JOS is a pretty good aggro weapon, but I'm pretty sure the aggro comes from DPS and not the proc. I bet EoE's proc is much better aggro than JOS's pathetic Velious era proc. When I steal aggro from my tank, more often than not it's unrelated to JOS proc. It's definitely a better off hander than Quarm hammer for warriors though.<br />

Wondering if it would be a resonable alternative to EoE offhand, dbotw primary. I seem to remember frostbite as being resonable agro, but I'm curious about the proc rate mostly. Also curious if the additional dps from the JOS would make up for the lower agro proc.<br />
<br />
The aggro from the proc is a bit lower than a ykesha proc, but above a straight dd proc. <br />
<br />
I think it easily makes up for that however, in pure ratio especially when you consider offhand which only procs one time a minute without WA or CE, even then I doubt eoe would overcome the difference.<br />
<br />
If I had had an EOE before jos dropped, it would have been a tough choice, Jos is better, there is no question to me, but it's not a case where it's so much better that you might feel compelled to upgrade.  An EOE is more than enough, and a JoS is a little more than that.</div></div><hr />

 I did an 8 hour parse and did not see 3 procs per minute on ykesha with WA5 (I did see 3 on time snap).<br />

i agree with that, it depends on the amount of rune and DD i think for point 3.<br />

Having used a scimitar of lifestealing during kunark era i can tell you, lifetap is close to 0 aggro, anyone who had a Jaelen Katana would tell you the same.<br />

It is still a somewhat usefull proc tho in some setups, but don't expect any aggro from it...</div></div><hr />

Thats the only difference in the two I can think of so I am guessig somethign to do with resist checks is what is causing a higher amount of aggro to be aquired from DD's over Taps.</div></div><hr />

Assuming spell aggro is calculated based on the effects and not stored on a per-spell basis, the difference must be the poison counters. This also holds when comparing resist debuffs - only the Tash line has a poison counter.</div></div><hr />

as far as the EoE aggro, at that stage of the game 1.5 ppm in offhand on the EoE on a rogue shouldn't pull aggro off a Time equipped warrior.</div></div><hr />

I have dbotw jos and eoe all anger 3 aug'd, the only time I use eoe is when I'm using JoS primary in xp groups for dps and I wouldnt even use then if darkblade was offhandable. I only got a JoS for the extra dps though, agro seems the same with either in offhand, should just take what you can get of the 2 imo with a preference for staff<br />
<br />
I'm one of the few people that actually like the graphic too though, if thats an issue for you then eoe is still great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Injektilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">If i knew both the EOE and the JOS existed, id take the JOS.  Having an EoE already though, i wouldnt take a JOS, its not a big enough upgrade to warrant the dkp cost it would set me back, and there is probably some ridiculous 1 hander for warriors just around the bend, ala Darkglint Blade for rangers.  <br />

2. stuns<br />
3. rune/dd (not sure between these 2)<br />
4. dot<br />

Slightly off topic but this is one of the first times I've seen rune put that far down on the hate list.  So does that mean a SeWs with Rune 3 is really not all that good aggro?  I've heard ppl say that the Rune 3 was around 400-600 pts of hate, which would put it above a stun, but if it's really ranked with a DD you're saying it's doing around 100 hate or less?  Thx and sorry for being abit off topic.</div></div><hr />

My hunch is that JoS + EoE would be more dps.</div></div><hr />

Not really around the bend (from Uqua), but it's for warriors and isn't too far out of whack with darkglint blade: http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68742<br />

Not sure what ya meant by &quot;ridiculous,&quot; but IMO the only thing ridiculous about the ranger sword is the graphic. =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Gobsmash Emgood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">The SEWS only required peris to be used for effect at first when it came out and was later changed. The reason it gives agro is that rune counts as a buff and gives agro like a small heal would, when it procs you are in effect buffing yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Hinanek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">I have one, unaugg'd at the moment, and it is alot better aggro than BoC in mainhand, thats really the only comment I can give you on it for now :P</div></div><hr />

I meant ridiculously good =)<br />
<br />
And i know the Fleshbiter exists, its not really the ridiculously good 1 hander people were looking for though.  Maybe if it was offhand usable or something /shrug.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>Kilzalot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">JoS + EoE both with A3 seem to hold pretty good aggro so far :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>Demorgoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">Never had the opportunity to extensively compare JoS as a primary mainhand weapon, since all our warriors have Darkblade (11 from 50 kills). However, comparing directly between offhand agro paired with a DBotW, even an unauged JoS noticeably outagroes an anger3 auged EoE (both with WA5/RaexBP/etc.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>Aonodorus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">As far as the validity of using JoS/EoE to tank on raids, Rylaa and I both use that combo regularly now, and have no aggro issues.  If we want to get aggro, we can hold it easily, and if we don't want aggro, we can keep it off ourselves easily.  I use EoE primary, Rylaa uses JoS primary, both seem to work just as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>Buuhmann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">Im pretty happy with my JoS + A3 / EoE + Yak combo in expgroups or JoS + A3 / BF + A3 as MT for max aggro.</div></div><hr />
