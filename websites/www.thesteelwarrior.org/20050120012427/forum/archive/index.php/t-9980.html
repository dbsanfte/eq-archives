<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mashor Dabashor</div><div class="date">12-10-2004, 12:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got lucky the other night in Riftseekers and was able to pick up the 4 70hp augs for rings and ears.  What I ended up with was my two 15ac Ferubi and a dropped 10ac aug from RCoD with no free slots to put them into.  So after a bit of thinking I stuck them into my waist, shoulder and back aug slots and sold back the 10ac augs I had bought from MM Ldon camp.<br />
<br />
 Now I am wondering if I should of kept the 10ac Ldon augs in place and replaced 3 40hp augs that I have on my helmet, boots and arms. Points arn't really an issue for me these days as I have quite a few banked and nothing I want to buy anymore.  What I am looking for is to maximize my tanking potential.  <br />
<br />
 On a side note I am starting to hate the haste aug that I am using now. Had to put it on my gloves for lack of a better spot.  After passing on alot of haste bracers from the mud ring in PoE I find myself thinking this might now be a good item to pick up. That or the shoulders from the Stone ring.  I've been holding out for Raex arms but I may end up sliding down the merit list so I can get rid of this damned aug. I have another 25ac aug banked for a bracer once I can dump my NRo Ldon one so this is adding to my rush to replace a bracer.  Or should I just hold out and hope for a MPG trial drop for haste or try and harrass guildmates into trying for the bracer out of Ink3? Neither I nor my regular groupmates are flagged past trial 7 so will have to find someone who is to come with us.  Looking forward to reading the boards oppinions on my questions and thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

You'll lose out on a potential 20-25AC as opposed to grabbing a Raex bracer, but everyone knows you sacrifice stats for haste in most cases.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're always going to have to sacrifice when it comes to haste.  It's mandatory, and the items that have it are always statistically less significant then standard items that would normally fit that slot.  <br />
<br />
Judging by your magelo, you seem like you're a person with a high playtime and a high amount of motivation, meaning you're willing to work hard for what you want.  I like those kinds of people =P.  The best choice for you would simply be getting into Ikkinz.  You're gonna have to do some work and defeat both Ikkinz1 (Trial of Singular Might) and Ikkinz2 (Trial of Twin-Fates) to gain access to Ikkinz3 (Trial of Tri-Struggles), but Ikkinz3 is where the money is, not to mention you'll be that many steps closer to accessing Ikkinz raids.  What you can get there is, mentioned above, the Crafted Wristband of Strife:<br />

It drops off a Kyv named (Hexxt something) that will be up the moment you enter the zone.  If you add a Flameshield Stone to it, it'll become an extremely respectable 50ac 160hp 46% haste item that can, honestly, last you a very, very long while.  Other benefits you'll gain by conquering Ikkinz is its other loots: Glyphed Prayer Ring (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68796), Resonating Earring of Battle (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68764), and Carved Vrex Totem (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68768).  Also of worthy mention, and I honestly think this is an aug a lot of Warriors overlook a lot of times, is the Glyphed Sandstone (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68800).  It drops off Diabolic Destroyer (Ikkinz1) as well as the Pile of Bones at the end of Ikkinz3.<br />
<br />
In the meanwhile, snag Raex gear every time you can.  Fill in the offslots with shit you can single group, like the stuff in Ikkinz.  It's tough, it's really freakin' tough, but I can tell you right now that the work in Ikkinz pays off tremendously.  <br />
<br />
The Ikkinz4 and 5 (raids) are easily doable by an elemental guild as well, btw.  ;)  It's not until Ikkinz6 that I'd recommend Time gear, but a guild on my server did it with pretty minimal elemental farming actually.  Hell, they even beat Ikkinz7 (Keeper of the Altar) before they were Time flagged, haha.</div></div><hr />

That eliminates any slot that uses 40 hp augs.  Both augs drop in  RS.</div></div><hr />
