I've been doing them in NRo as a friends character and I barely won the last collect 25, and failed the collect 25 before (Thanks to the damned warrior falling asleep at keyboard half way through.)  Overall, I've noticed that the collects seem to be taking much longer than the standard 30-40 minutes they once took to collect 25-30? Anyone else been noticing this... my 'stealth nerf' feelings are tingling.  After all, the bastards didn't come out and say it when they nerfed LDoN cash drops.</div></div><hr />

I hadn't done a LDON in months.  It took us 68 kills to get 27 drops.  Was a Guk.<br />

Seemed absurd.  But I shrugged it off until I read this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
it always annoyed me that when it takes 30 minutes to put a group together get buffed and get to the dungeon that we would be finished only 30 minutes later. thats not time efficient. really id like to see collects made harder and assasinates and rescues made easier so that all four mission types would have approximately equal appeal. i like variety and i enjoy assasinations but i have to agree that they are not wise to do if you want to guarantee success or get out in a reasonable time.</div></div><hr />

First one, collect 22, took just 21 mins. Don't seem any harder than before to me personally. Depends on the group I suppose.</div></div><hr />

Its too small to say anything but i've found EC LDoN drop rates to be the worst, even before I started recording.  The third number is just dependant on your DPS as you can see, but first and second are whats important.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Aye, I remember doing collects when LDoN first came out. Collect below 25 were much harder that above, usually they higher the better. I remember noticing that the drop rate really sucked on the ones below 25.<br />
<br />
I still hold that opinion somewhat...though nowdays, I have a hard time telling whether it is a bad drop rate or just a bad group. The latter seems so much more common than when LDoN came out. For  some reason my druid always ends up in a group with 3 knights, enchater, a shammy and my druid...wondering why kills take so long.<br />
<br />
I have a long an &quot;interesting&quot; discussion last night with another great group about DPS classes. Seems at least a few think that bards are great dps, and wizzys aren't.../sigh...</div></div><hr />

<br />
From what i've seen of wizards of all gear colors, wizards DPS is pretty shitty until they are fully developed, high FT, Pool and AAs, then they are amongst the top. That's in a long grind of course, not single raid targets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">07-02-2004, 01:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A bard in a melee heavy group can add a nice chunk of dps.  +30% overclocked haste, anyone?  Of course casters also get the additional mana regen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">07-02-2004, 02:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">bards - by themselves their dps sucks. I dont care what they say about the dot song twisting and providing numbers of 100+ dps. Their mele dps is minimal and they can do some dots which are nothing to write home about anyways. 4 song twists take what 30 seconds? by then mob is almost dead anyways. If you count bard benefit to group DPS which is unfair then you can have a valid argument. I am also dismissing bard charming since that is almost never done in group setting.<br />
<br />
Wizzards have very decent dps as long as they not afk types and fighting mobs in their level range.</div></div><hr />

There are other types of wizards?</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, it isn't unfair at all.  Consider a group of five looking to add a sixth member with only dps in mind.  There are extremely few group compositions for something like an LDoN where a Bard is not an excellent answer.  Between overhaste, mana regen, nuke focus and melee damage (and +attack procs etc) a good Bard is a nice choice if you don't already have one.  Of course they are normally chosen for other reasons but a bards ability to add dps is nothing to sneeze at, with melees or casters for that matter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Partha</div><div class="date">07-10-2004, 03:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd also mention that a Bard with his LoY songs makes traps/boxes a casual affair.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Holywrath</div><div class="date">07-10-2004, 08:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really prefer having a bard when I do LDoN's.  You can't beat the overhaste and DS amplifier. Me + my shaman + magi/druid + bard + 2 melee make for FAST normals.  We don't pull though, charge into rooms and try to get at least 3 mobs at a time to maximize the DS.  Don't slow either, would hurt the DS dmg.<br />
<br />
I also haven't noticed collects to be taking longer, in fact, we finish them too quickly and they make us wait =(</div></div><hr />
