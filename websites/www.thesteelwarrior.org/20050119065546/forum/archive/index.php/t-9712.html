I have aggro problems sometimes so I need some advice on equipment or is that shaman that slows, then immediately sits need some talking to.<br />
<br />
I try to do all the right things, arrow the inc mob, bellow, taunt when I need to, /shield others near me (great skill), etc.<br />
<br />
My tankability could use some work though, and I'd appreciate some advice.  The magelo isn't 100% complete, but it has most of the relevant stuff.  Thanks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Everlord</div><div class="date">11-12-2004, 12:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, First off Drop your SBoD for your CHoS, Has a Proc that generates agro first off and the SBoD is only good for DPS ( IMO)...2nd get Sword of Bloodsworn..Has a Stun Proc, Which also generates agro.. Other than that your gear seems substantial for your lvl. I wouldnt worry till about 60+ My war had full FIerce until lvl 63 so...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aamen</div><div class="date">11-12-2004, 12:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, they're in one of my bags there.  I use that default setup for 'dps' and less aggro which works well.  I could use some augments probably but, damn, LDoN can get kinda tired.  My mage has done, I dunno, over a hundred and it can burn out a player.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Everlord</div><div class="date">11-12-2004, 12:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another thing..If your in a Sufficient Raiding Guild...talk to them about raiding Xana in PoI and the AOW in Kael get a BOC and a CHSD and aug those with Ykesha Procs...And try to look for 2 Steel Ring of Earthen Resilience. ( i think thats spelled right)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ooka</div><div class="date">11-12-2004, 12:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Agree with the above weapons advice. Also just mention to the shammy to give you an extra second to get aggo before he slows. If he's sitting directly after his slow .... &lt;sigh&gt; shoot him and recommend if he's going to do that to put AAs into SCS (spell casting subtlety.. reduced aggro for spells).<br />

You may want to look into a GSoT as well.  Situationally i found it to be better ... but some here will disagree with that  :D .<br />
<br />
Just run some ldons and buy some cheap yak or anger augments as needed.<br />
<br />
Your gear is stupidly powerful for your level, but 2 very easy upgrade you can make are Fierce heraldic arms and gloves.  Other than that just get some aggro augments and level yourself. Your gear should suit you just fine as is for at least 10 more levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">11-12-2004, 08:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Everlord and Apolyon have made some very good suggestions.<br />
While the SBoD is pretty good dps, I'd sell the damn thing. <br />
And, meh, you have all the gear you need for the next several levels; the cultural stuff Everlord pointed out could well be your next upgrades. <br />
I know it's tedious, but LDoN hate augs are your next stop. If you know anyone who plays a class that can single pull, and anyone who can do crowd control, and any cleric, you can easily tank hard LDoNs at your level with your gear. My 54 warrior was doing them with 100 less AC, 250-ish fewer hitpoints, significantly less haste, and a GSoT.<br />
Politely ask your shaman to stand next to you when he slows &amp; debuffs the mobs. If he wants to sit down after that, have him wait a round or two and then move back away from you and the mob. <br />
Some Shaman are well enough geared at lvl 55 that they can take a few punches from experience mobs at that level. So, getting hit doesn't yet represent significant risk to them. Nevertheless, there's little point in making you run across the room to get aggro off of them and then re-position the mob with respect to other melee and pets, etc. The shaman might not be going splat, but it's cutting group dps, decreasing the shaman's ability to can efficiently, decreasing the efficiency of group healing mana, and making it take longer to kill the mob. At level 55 and with a tank as well geared as you are to take a punch, very very likely everything that is gained by getting the slow in that fast is lost by ganking your aggro. And if you are using the droga weapon set, then you are generating aggro about as fast as a warrior can at that level.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you're guild isn't ready for AoW, but they can take Xana, you can do the BoT Tower boss that drops the Greatblade of Storms?  (I think it's Blizzard tower, but I'd check Alla's cause it's been awhile)<br />
<br />
By the way, Xana also drops a nice 41% haste neck item.</div></div><hr />
