<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Barja Bardagi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay guys, been around 20 levels and 17 AA's since I did this last, so don't jump me for asking for some gear advice.<br />
<br />
Guild is a Vindi-Level guild.  Currently working Epics, HoT, Vindi as our major raids most of the time.  I have around 190K in the bank and a steady source of income (smithing Heraldic armors).  I have a VERY good reputation as a warrior and 'guest' with several larger guilds when I can.  I get to help on BoT Tower raids and such.  Not quite AoW level, but certainly more then Vindi.  My ability to loot items during these raids varies from occasionally to never.  I don't want to leave my own guild, so joining an Elemental/Time guild is not an option.<br />
<br />
Current Gear (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=493288)<br />
<br />
I have Augments for Fire +6, Disease +6, STR +6, and DEX +6, but I have no clue on where to put them so I haven't yet.  I have considered putting the Disease on my Fear (Indicolite or whatever) boots for use when I swap to resist gear, but that's VERY VERY rarely.  I have ~400 points in MM, and none anywhere else yet.<br />
<br />
So, what items should I be looking to replace and what do I replace them with?<br />
What augments should I be shooting for?<br />
<br />
For weapons-<br />
Do I keep saving for a BoC, or do I try an Open Tower Raid and try and win a GBoS?<br />
Do I look at other options?<br />
<br />
Kinda lost for a clear direction to go, so any help is of use.<br />
<br />
Thanks all!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Naralli_VoLS</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You are at the same spot that alot of warriors get to in 65: you are at the point where the gear upgrades must come from drops off UBER mobs that take 50+ people to drop.<br />
I personally dont suggest paying for any of the ornate armor molds as they are very minor upgrades on your gear and the cost is not worth it.<br />
Yes a BoC would be a weapon upgrade ( for the proc and definitely the stats 15 sta +100 hp  ) But do you have to buy it? Or is the guild you are a part of not ready to make that next step?<br />
If it is to cost you cash don't buy it.<br />
Anyways here are my suggestions that are attainable for you:<br />
1. Neck slot. Since you are a Vindi capable guild take out the Vadyn in Akheva ruins and get his shaderock amulet. It is only 15 ac but is 100 hit points.<br />
2. Earring for 41% haste item. Get the Earring of endless speed off Doomshade in Umbral Plains. It is decent stats, saves to all and moves the haste to an ear slot so you can get a Hit point cloak.<br />
<br />
Beyond these two items I think you are equipped just like every other warrior out there that is pre SSRA/Vex Thal/Elelmentals.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Damn boy, you almost have better shyte than I do!<br />
<br />
-Weaponry:<br />
<br />
Yeah, I'd try and win a GBoS from an open tower raid if I were you.  That's one hell of a solid agro weapon, not to mention it does very good dps to boot.  My fellow warrior guildies use the GBoS and while I snatch agro faster than they do, they *always* take it from me.  GBoS + SoD all the way.<br />
<br />
-Armor<br />
<br />
The Strength of the Elements is a very solid and easy gear piece to work for.  Phinney spawns every 12 hours and always drop the ore.  You can't miss the ground spawn pickup in Skyfire.  Guardian Kozzalym is hard to track, but he's duoable as long as you don't get dragon adds.  Mind you though, you will.  Hehe.  With Yael gone, the ore from him now drops off the boss's guards.  The only problem you'll have with that quest is dragging your friends out of LDoN and convincing them to help you for 5 minutes.<br />
<br />
Helmet of Rallos Zek.  You said you had the cash.  Pick one up.  This will easily last you well into Elemental Planes, so consider it one hell of a long term investment.<br />
<br />
Kizrak Armguards.  Check my magelo, these things are pretty spoogin'.  At least on my server, they cost the least out of the ornate inventory.<br />
<br />
You might as well pick up another Steel Ring of Earthen Resilience, but I'm sure those are undoubtedly rare in the bazaar.  Do no be afraid to possibly quest the 10th Dain Ring as well.  It's long, it's hard, but everyone I've talked to said it was well worth the investment time.<br />
<br />
If you do HoT, try doing some of the quest out of there also.  The thing is, SoE has itemized back slots to carry the same ac values as breastplates.  Don't believe me?  Check my magelo.  What I'm trying to get at though is that you possibly lose a lot of ac by wearing your haste item in your back slot.  Quite conveniently, there's a quest out of HoT that results in a 38ac 100hp 41% haste bracer.  It's hard, but warriors aren't supposed to be easy.  Do the time for that one and you'll be wearing it well into the elemental planes.  <br />
<br />
Judging by your neck item, it looks as if you've done NToV with other guilds.  Lady Nevedaria, probably one of the hardest dragons in NToV, drops a spoogin' 35ac 12sta 100hp cloak + clicky called Cloak of Thorns.  I wouldn't count on that one any time soon though.  If you're raiding with another guild, it'll probably go to one of them.  If you don't have access to that, then the Loyalist Shield of Honor is a viable alternative.  That one is 50ac 15str 15wis 75hp and can be done with a single group.<br />
<br />
***EDITED***<br />
<br />
Keep in mind though, with LDoN, there are a TON of upgrades for warriors that have yet to be found.  Play the game, wait it out, save your points, build some AA, then choose upgrades that are going to upgrade you the most.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Terrorus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I wouldnt bother with a BoC, the weapons you are sporting are decent enough and with the amount of pp it will cost you to buy a BoC; I'm pretty sure you will be disappointed.  Only reason I use mine is that I like the stats and I threw a 100dd aug in there that kind of offsets the shit proc rate of the BoC.<br />
<br />
Several upgrades to be had in NToV, all dragons but Nev and Vyemm are a joke.  Nev is easy actually, just takes patience..its a long fight. (20 - 30min depending on DPS).  Or, Just farm eashen for masks, rings, bracers, cloaks if you want,  like Vindi but with an AE.<br />
<br />
Its amazing what you can buy today.  Getting decent gear without having to step foot in North, ST, or farm HoT/West/Kael.  Way to kill velious, may as well rip it out of the game.  Sad really...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Angelcrusha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ok, you're doin very well at this point I'd say. Sporting the equipment of a seemingly twinked warrior being most of your stuff is droppable. =o)<br />
<br />
Honestly, Fierce Heraldic stuff is very nice, and if you can get pickup groups in BoT, its a great place to pick up Kizrak's armor. Thangbrand drops the bracers, Gaukr Sandstorm drops the legs, well, you can look up the rest, but you get the idea. The drop rate on these isn't too bad. Otherwise, with 190k you may as well buy a few pieces. <br />
<br />
As they said, yes, best items at this point are going to be Helmet of Rallos Zek, and GBoS. However, keep an eye out for Copper Hammer of Striking (same proc as GBoS) which runs fairly cheap on E'Ci (Though you can nearly duo the King camp in Droga to pick one up.) Keep an eye out for boots of the storm, which are nice melee boots as well. <br />
<br />
I would advise against the Earring of Endless speed, as that takes HP away from your bloodmetal. Look for some of the new haste items found from PoP and LDoN and judge for yourself. Though the BoC is very nice, and I love mine, I wouldn't pay 400k+ or whatever people are charging on your server. Just not worth the small upgrade in HP and proc rate. <br />
<br />
Keep in mind if your guild can take Vindi, you are capable of taking down many higher end Luclin mobs and Velious Sleeper's Tomb key mobs as well. (i.e. Klandicar, Statue of Rallos Zek possibly, Zlandicar, etc.) If you can get those down, and get the upgrades from them, your guild can progress further from the upgrades they give. Possibly even into Sleeper's Tomb or SSRA. Thus giving you more opportunities for upgrades. <br />
<br />
However, with your current gear, and the right AA's, you've nearly matched my own AC/HP hehe. And I'm in a guild currently in Sleeper's and killing Tier 2 Gods in PoP. =o)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Looks like your biggest upgrades are going to come from helm, earring, bracers, and ring. Get yourself a helm of RZ, another Bloodmetal ear, and another Earth ring. If there is a chance you can get a ToV quest bracer, go for it, it opens up your back slot for all kinds of upgrades. If that is not an option, I would spend the plats for 2x Crystallized Acid bracers. You have enough to be able to afford a couple now depending on the market on your server.<br />
<br />
As for your weapons I would do 2 things -<br />
<br />
Keep trying for a GBoS, solid agro and DPS weapon.<br />
<br />
I would also do what a lot of people on this board consider heresy - I would sell/trade the SoD and replace it with a BoC.<br />
<br />
By switching out to GBoS main/BoC off, you will get an increase in agro, DPS, and stats. You really can't go wrong with that set up.<br />
<br />
Some marginal upgrade that I would also look for (to loot, not to buy) - Kizrak BP and legs, Boots of the Strom, and either Velium encrusted or new LDoN Warlord gaunts (bag the Kizrak's for the effect).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You have enough to be able to afford a couple now depending on the market on your server. <br />
<br />
Pff, acid bracers don't sell on CT.  Only one i've seen in the last few months is at 200k right now in the bazaar.  It's a nice idea, but a total pipe dream for anyone who can't do the ring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Barja Bardagi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Okay, I'm looking at Helm and Bloodmetal.   That'll wipe a lot of my current funds.  Earth Ring will take a little time, the guy I was buying through for damn cheap left the game for a while.  Acid Bracers are near impossible to get on this server.  I'll have to look for other options... ToV Quest is a possiblity.<br />
<br />
Yes, this is a twinked character, but I smithed the armor myself and earned the cash to buy what my guild couldn't get, or I couldn't with friends.  I tanked Vindi 4 times to earn the BP with my guild.  If that makes me less of a warrior - Bite me. :)<br />
<br />
I'm also considering getting Str. of the Elements, then augmenting it with the 10AC Aug from Mistmoore.  25AC 15STR 15vsF/C and 100HP seems a decent item to me.  =P<br />
<br />
I'll keep shooting for a GBoS... Hard to find open raids though. =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">if you can hold out on ToV faction; get that  quest bracer ( i think it's 4 tears all dozer drops; so guild might look at you funny )..i kixk myself to this day for not doing any ToV quests before our ToVN days :(</div></div><hr />

Wow that sucks for you guys! On TT there are 3-4 for sale in the baz for the last couple week and prices are dropping - none sold at 125k and I saw one of them drop to 95k last night. I got 2 a while back for 100k and 125k. Right now would be a perfect time to farm the ring - everyone is busy in LDoN, most old world stuff has been up for days. Once you know the slime ring it can be 1 grouped pretty easy, just a really long fight.</div></div><hr />

And extremely anticlimatic when the acidic mass drops only the crap sword.  He's done that at least 2-3 times to us in the past, pretty much why we stopped bothing with him.  Acid bracer is very rare, and as far as I know the FT gloves no longer drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If your guild can do Vindi they can probably do Xanamech in PoI aswell.  Hes fairly farmable and drops a nice 41% haste neck and the 13/19 taunting blow weapon.  As I understand its the kinda event thats almost always up too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Barja Bardagi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Sorry for bumping an old post, but felt is was better then starting another.<br />
<br />
Okay, grabbed a 2nd Bloodmetal Earring and Helm of Rallos Zek.  My Elemental-capable friend JUST got back into the game this week, so I might be able to get a second Earth Ring soon.  I'm down to 87K in the bank, but will have cash coming in soon as I get off LDoN/BoT and spend a week farming smithing materials.  We're hitting HoT this Friday and if Dozer's up and we have good numbers, I'm going to run our first attempt on him.  I think I REALLY want that quest bracer.<br />
<br />
I've had zero luck with Open Tower raids lately... Literally can't even find one, much less win an item.  I need to do a few more to learn them before I'm willing to lead an open raid myself.  In Guild, I've set our 4 month raiding goal at King Tormax, so the Velium Encrusted Gaunts are a possiblity.  Just got Tactics Flag, so I should be able to get Kizrak's arms soon (can't get anyone to farm Elif in BoT).  Lost past 3 rolls on Ornate Legs to bloody casters, but I'll get it eventually.  I've got 2 of the 4 ores for the Str. of the Elements quest, and enough MMC points to buy the 10AC aug for them.  That should upgrade the shoulders nicely I think.<br />
<br />
Boots of the Storm are going to have to be a purchased item if I go for them, guild is now where close to AoW ready.<br />
<br />
Weapons, I'm still stuck at, but thinking of aug'ing SoD with a Ykesha proc and earning up points for a Curse Smelted Long Blade if I don't win a GBoS before then.<br />
<br />
So, thanks for the input guys and if you see some more ideas, let me know.</div></div><hr />

Got lucky and found someone selling one in the bazaar channel the other day on CT.  He took 63k, Leatherfoot Haversack, and Brellium Platemail Bracer in exchange for it!  :)</div></div><hr />
