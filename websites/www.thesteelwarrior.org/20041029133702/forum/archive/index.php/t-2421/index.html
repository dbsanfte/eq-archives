<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Greyslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey Everyone just had a quick question.  My guild has been tryin to catch this guy up for awhile now.  I know if you fight him and lose he will depop a short time later.  Question is once he spawns say on server reset for instance does he stay up until someone tries him or can he depop?  Thanks :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Korinn_emarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">He stays up until you start the event by keeping the spiders out of his room. Once he becomes targetable he has like 30 minutes until he depeps. <br />
<br />
I am pretty certain that info is correct.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Me too. If you fail, it will be 3 days till he be up again. He does stay up until someone KEEEEEELS him, if no one has made him targetable since he last spawned.</div></div><hr />
