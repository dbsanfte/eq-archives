If you don't mind, can you post more details about these changes as you know them? What spells in particular and what kind of changes are being done.<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />

I got a whiff of this from scanning a couple of Furor's posts so I thought he might have more concrete information, or if it's already posted, shoot me to that thread. Or if anybody has any concrete information, I'm just curious to find out what is happening.<br />

<br />
Like I said, the developers took a look at fears/stuns in balancing the provoke line and weren't happy with the current hate they were producing for the current mana costs. You can deride from that whatever...that's all we know<br />
<br />
If I was guessing I'd say they'll put 0 agro on &quot;immune&quot; spells and create a new way for SK's to agro (with a real mana cost).</div></div><hr />

Their tanking ability is just too close to ours now for them to have such cheap &amp; easy aggro-lock.  I have good friends that are Knights, and I don't want to champion their nerfage, but damn, lets be realistic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Heres hoping they take a long, hard look at all knight spells before touching them.  Long enough to see how overpowered they are currently, and long enough to tune them properly (to roughly 4% better than provoke).<br />
<br />
Let me restate that, since we have a Dev present... <br />
<br />
Since warriors hvae a ca. 4-5% mitigation advantage in the near future, a 5% agro advantage for knight is perfectly fair.  No more, no less.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Very interesting.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the bit of an update. Hope all goes well with your testing on aggro.<br />
<br />
If you want some feedback on possible solutions, I'm sure many people here will be more than happy to offer some feedback, insight, ideas.<br />
<br />
As, obviously, will many paladins and shadowknights.<br />
<br />
And I hope you're also looking into the concerns people have raised over the pure hate spells being buggy. Fixing them may help the overall solution.<br />
<br />
Anyways, good luck. And HEY, how'd you get a green name in your title? (Yeah, the last one's more for Raaj than you, heh).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Synapticus</div><div class="date">12-12-2003, 11:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">SK aggro spells are an insult.  They just dont work.  A Shadow Knight meleeing and chain casting terror will not even out aggro a warrior meleeing with the same weapon.  In short, TERROR SPELLS DONT DO JACK.  Mana efficiency isnt even the issue.  If they actually worked, I would not be using all the spells that I am using at this time.<br />
<br />
The ability to hold aggro well is one of the biggest reason I enjoy playing my Shadow Knight.  It just sucks to hear that this is probably going to change soon.<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: hit submit reply by accident.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arathena</div><div class="date">12-13-2003, 12:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye, when I load 3000+ of pure hate into a mob, I expect to out aggro one fucking arrow. Right now, that's not the case. Useless. Entirely because they didn't want us tanking Arch Lich from 200 range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yuniargo</div><div class="date">12-13-2003, 12:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't know much about the Shadow Knight class but I've grouped with them a lot as my cleric and enchanter.  When SK uses that +hate spell, my enchanter seems to get beat down often from doing his regular tash + slows.  When the SK uses a darkness spell he seems to be able to hold aggro without a problem; even if I tash + slow right off the bat.<br />
<br />
Something definately seems to be wrong with the SK +hate spell line.  Maybe they're getting partially resisted on most mobs.  If they are, would be nice to have a message indicating how much hate was generated from the SK's cast of the +hate spell.<br />
<br />
On that note, I wonder if the new warrior +hate skills will be partially resistable.  Hmm hope this doesn't give the devs any strange ideas :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sorguran</div><div class="date">12-13-2003, 12:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">there's a difference between balancing against root mobs... and balancing in general.... cut down SK hate spells to 100 range like provoke, and reinstate their hate, makes it fine imo..... but then I actually like SK's.<br />
<br />
Pallies should get no aggro, all their heals taken away, and be forces to use pure melee and disc's for aggro.... ALL THE TIME....... course... I'm only kidding.  I'm not in favor of knights being nerfed, but unless a vastlye superior aggro system is given to warriors, then we will still be only marginally ahead of SK's/Pallies in hp/surviveability, and still be behind them in aggro capabilities.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chumbot</div><div class="date">12-13-2003, 01:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">as an sk,  this fear change bothers me. not sure why they trying to nerf it at this point, it's no were as overpowered as stun is in aggro department. it usally takes me about 2-3 cast of a fear and invoke fear to get a good aggro lock on stuff and even then i have to keep casting it occasionly to sustain aggro. Thats actualy pretty good bit of mana too, 40-100-40mana to lock(which takes about 10 sec to do) and occasional 40 mana every 15 sec to sustain the aggro. just dont see how this overpowered.<br />
<br />
 if fear taunt is taken from SK's then we'll have no non-damage aggro except for broken terror spells(and they way useless in there current form ). that would leave SK's with pretty much darkness and dps to tuant which is not a good thing for mez tanking and would kill SK's role of an non damage OT(there goes my job at rathe too). enchaters  will have much more mez breaks from this and of course will have to caster tank mobs much more  befor he/she can get them mezed. honestly i've had a small role of a no damage ot sense luclin and i rather not give up this role up now just becuase they dont like sk using a bug as one of their main sources of aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeka</div><div class="date">12-13-2003, 01:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wasn't aware of problems with SK spells.  Interesting...it should be addressed.  Any effect that is not doing what it is intended needs to be fixed.<br />
<br />
As I've mentioned in various places, once Warriors get a similar skill set, then one can start making comparisons if Paladin Stuns are too strong.  Put the new skills in place first, make sure they work, and then come back to figure out what is up with SK spells and if Paladin spells need to be tuned.  Doing both at the same time is inviting disaster.<br />
<br />
Importantly, SKs and Paladins should not be nerfed simply to make some of you happy (/glare Darkoan).  Since there is no object collision in EQ, to be a tank you need duribility and agro control.  Warriors are finally getting the skills necessary to fulfill the role they were designed into.  In turn, taking agro away from SKs and Paladins is a horribly bad idea.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Within reason offcourse, or the game will continue being broken.<br />
And they have their own community messageboards.<br />
<br />
I recommend that if any Knight have some good ideas on issues, to post it on their own board and post a link in this thread with a short summary of what it is (as in, a one or two line summary).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
My thoughts on the issues at hand.<br />
<br />
General Knight issues :<br />
I'm sure we can all agree to the simple fact that if a MOB is immune to something, it should mostly ignore it unless there is no previous aggro .. ie. it's idle.<br />
I mean, see it from the NPC point - If you were immune to low level stuns and just hanging out in your own corner and someone came and casted a stun on you that you were immune to, you know what is gonna happen next, another stun you are not immune to will obviously follow, or something else that is bad for you. Obviously you aggro on whomever it is. But if someone else nuked you for 654 points of non-melee damage at the same time, you'd go for him instead because he actually HURT you.<br />
<br />
Something along the line of :<br />
I realy hate Player A, but I also hate Player B a little and he actually HURT me !<br />
He will not get away with this !!<br />
<br />
Thus spells MOBs are immune to could still be used as low mana pulling tools but not aggro lock tools.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Shadowknights :<br />
As has been mentioned with spell immunities above, I think that the pure hate spells don't work well is because they put out only pure hate, but no damage on the MOB, so the MOB's modifier will be, lets say +500 hate on SK. Then wizard nukes for 100 points of damage and gains .. lets say 50 aggro and modifier for doing damage - Guess who you will go for ? Yup, the wizard.<br />
<br />
Most likely we will see the same happen with the new Provoke ability line for Warriors, that since no damage have been done by the warrior, they don't have complete aggro until they get a bit of Melee done. But it should still help since you can reduce the length of Melee to be done before the warrior have enough aggro to nor loose it to a debuff, like slow.<br />
<br />
I think Shadowknights have to think along those lines as well.<br />
<br />
So, perhaps let SK's have 2 hate lines, one pure hate spell to use on mezmerized MOBs and one with Damage + Hate for actual fighting, possible let the damage be a lifetap of some sort. Both should have good long range, since SK's are often pullers and as has been mentioned, some MOBs have pretty large aggro range.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Paladins :<br />
well - I still think Stuns should still give good aggro if they are not immune to it, since it's damned annoying to be stunned. Possibly give them some zero second stuns + Damage with relatively low mana, fast cast and a bit longer recharge than the standard 2.25 seconds so you cannot chaincast it. But if they have two such stuns memmed they will could almost be able to almost chain stun them with little melee between. That way some of the balance will be tied to the spell gem bar which has a constant size.<br />
<br />
Also, I think Paladins should get some Group Cure spells for those area effect raids.<br />
Possibly even one area effect cure at highest level.<br />
<br />
Another idea would be to let them have a &quot;partial group heal&quot; which healed group at varying degree's. To help heal on those they get a few ripostes here and there, or in weak AE damage spell from MOBs.<br />
An example on such a spell:<br />
<br />
Paladins Healing Presence<br />
Class :Alteration<br />
Mana : 350<br />
Target : Group or targetted group<br />
Duration : Instant<br />
AE range : 100<br />
Casting time : 2.5 seconds<br />
Recast time : 5.0 seconds<br />
Actual effects :<br />
Heals 1000 HP on the most wounded party Member.<br />
Heals 500 HP on second most wounded party Member.<br />
Heals 250 HP on third most wounded party Member.<br />
Heals 125 HP on forth most wounded party Member.<br />
Heals 65 HP on fifth most wounded party Member.<br />
Heals 30 HP on sixth most wounded party Member.<br />
<br />
They should be fast cast, fairly fast recast and pretty low mana, since the healing on most members is trivial. Ie. starts at 1000 and halves for each next member. Shadowknights could have something alike it, but a lifetap version.</div></div><hr />

I think these changes will give Warriors what we are looking for, namely better initial aggro, better mitigation, ability to strategize discs in certain scenarios and some much needed utility.<br />
<br />
I say leave knights alone and tweak up SK aggro spells if necessary for them to be effective.  <br />
<br />
I am also probably the only one on these boards who is in favor of leaving stuns on immune mobs alone in terms of aggro generation.  The GBoS and CHoS both use stuns that most mobs are immune to and help many Wars with their aggro.  <br />
<br />
Most of the arguments about immune to stun aggro is &quot;well, if the mob is immune to it, why would it generate any aggro.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hmm, don't really have a great answer for that but let me give it a shot.<br />
<br />
Suppose I am wearing a bulletproof vest and some SoB shoots me in the chest with a small caliber pistol.  Well, I am immune to it; however, it certainly would generate a great deal of aggro...<br />

I think a better analogy is this...<br />
<br />
You are sitting inside a M1-A! Abrahms Main Battle tank. Some kid hits you with a water balloon, while another person is firing RPG's at you... <br />
<br />
Who do you attack?<br />
<br />
I believe the person with the RPG first, AFTER he is dead.. you may go back and get the guy with the water balloon. <br />
<br />
I never said he didnt piss you off, but, lets put it in perspective...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Buun Sofsteel</div><div class="date">12-14-2003, 01:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye, I said I didn't have a great answer for it :)  .<br />
<br />
However, I do not want to lose the aggro from my GBoS or my Ykesha proc on my GSoTFW.<br />
<br />
To your analogy add this.  In a realistic sense aggro is generated not ONLY by the reality of the damage but by the BELIEF of the mob that the danger is present.  After all, Taunt and Provoke don't actually do any damage.<br />
<br />
Perception my friend.  Mobs don't have the &quot;sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me&quot; immunity to taunt emote built in yet.  That will come sometime in the first quarter of next year :D  .<br />
<br />
Based on your analogy the mob should always go after whoever has the DPS eh?  Believe me the wizard is packing the RPG and the warrior would be closer to the water balloon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Buuns, I know where you're coming from, and I know why.  And yar, as you may guess, I don't agree (which doesn't mean I'm right) - I'll be more than happy to shelve my sub-65 stunning weaps if they nerf immune aggro.  Keep resist aggro, nerf immune - it wouldn't kill any class.  Raise the level limit on some stuns/procs if they're meant to generate aggro.  <br />
<br />
Aggro will never be 100% &quot;realistic&quot; - but that bit bugs me. Yar, I'd lose some aggro toys but I'd find summat else. Even if they cut in half ... &quot;That guy is throwing water balloons ... is that an RPG in his pocket?&quot; ... I would see that as reasonable game design.<br />
<br />
Somebody posted it ... the first time you throw a spell I am immune to, I may think you have better and attack.  The second or third time, I may think you're a gimp with nothing to offer.  Or maybe I'm just gonna get slowly ticked off with you, a little bit at a time.<br />
<br />
And ... based on the analogy, I'd go for the one co-ordinating the attacks, THEN the DPS, then the brat with the water balloons.  (Unless I was hydrophobic.)  So, if the guy with the water balloons seemed to be targetting me for the 5 other dudes, I'd cut off the head and then smoosh the limbs.</div></div><hr />

With all due respect but I think folks at this board know that.   However, demystifying some of the process by which you go about this might be in order.  This the key to a core customer relations thing called &quot;setting expectations&quot;.  Perhaps finding a level of detail to disclose w/o going low level would be helpful.<br />

<br />
 Also, It is not hard at all to coordinate any changes in aggro, by changing the type of proc on a weapon. Change the name, change the spell data... and the proc remains useful, while spells are tuned. This is a process people dont see to grasp, you can tune stuns and still retain the aggro on weapon procs, just as easilly... Besides, even the BBoTE when mobs immune to the stun, they still get the DD portion..</div></div><hr />

(1) MOB randomly selects any member on the hate list and agro locks that member till dead.<br />
<br />
(2) MOB flees at 80% health to enlist reinforcements.<br />
<br />
(3) MOB ignores/focuses on a single modifier, such as sitting or proximity, and only attacks those members on the hate list, or ignores that modifier entirely.<br />
<br />
Just ideas.  But when the game becomes predictable, it loses a little of its fascination.<br />

You are a complete and utter moron . . . that said let me explain this to you.  We don;t want you nerfed to kunark, we want the amount of hate you generate with your stuns to be proportionate to your level.  Notice how they balanced provoke . . . . now notice that you can use a level 9 and 15 level stun at a whopping 15mana to get the same amount of hate or more than I have at the highend of my provoke line.  Simply it's not balanced and the developers themselves did not imagine giving you a powerful hate spell that you can cast for virtually nothing.  Read carefully here, I want paladin;s to be fixed not nerfed . . . that requires the spells costs and hate values to be examined.  The current situation is broken, and if you see this as a nerf then you are too deluded to think strait, the spell cost needs to be adjusted as well as the hate adjusted to a &quot;fair&quot; value.  I could care less if you get more aggro than me from the spell as long as you cannot cast it infinitly . . . like you can now.  So go back to PoN and have a litttle crying session because things might actually get balanced, and you might actually watch your mana disappear after you chain stun a mob 8 times in a row.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Better disciplines already than paladins have&quot;<br />
Well DUH .. you are spellcasting fighters, not disciplined warriors.<br />
The time you use to learn spells, we use to learn disciplines.<br />
<br />
&quot;An 11 % advantage in defensive skills compared to knights&quot;<br />
Advantage ?<br />
What advantage ?<br />
This is all gone when the MOB is slowed before it really hurts you.<br />
And IMO, the gap SHOULD be bigger, you are hybrids dangit.<br />
Besides, you have the same mitigation table as warriors.<br />
<br />
&quot;Better dps than knights&quot;<br />
Offcourse we must have better Melee DPS since you can bolster yours with spells - DUH again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Better ac ratio conversion for raw ac to total ac.&quot;<br />
&quot;Better hp ratio on lvling and sta converion to total hp.&quot;<br />
This is our only means of being better tanks once we cap our defensive skills - What else should we ask for in that regard ?<br />
<br />
&quot;I agree warriors need some sort of fix .. but crying for the nerfing of knight spells (of which i keep maybe 1 set memmed for most everything I do in the game, and have about maybe 10 more situational ones) isn't going to fix the problem and I'd be glad to stop hearing warriors call for it.&quot;<br />
The &quot;nerf&quot; that is called for, is because Knights are holding aggro with spells that most of the MOBs they are fighting are supposed to be IMMUNE to.<br />
And that's highly unrealistic -- AND -- unbalancing.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sure furor would love to see us back to kunark days.&quot;<br />
You cannot be set back to the Kunark era unless SOE removes your defense skill caps, AA's, spells and uber ratio weapons.<br />
<br />
Besides that, I believe he mentioned that he plays a level 63 Shadoknight as well as his warrior .. and a Cleric I think ? Why would he want one of his own characters set back to Kunark era ?<br />
<br />
&quot;I'd say my biggest gripe with this whole thing is .. His argument seems to say we're some sort of utility class ala bard, shamen, chanter, when the fact remains we only do 1 thing of any count to an exp group .. and that's tank.&quot;<br />
Not true - In todays world, Paladins are great at assisting groups by healing them, buffing them, stunning spellcasters and rooting adds AND offtanking. And yes, you can be main tanks too. Shadowknights can rootpark, FD split pull, snare, group lifetap.<br />
You don't see warriors do all that, do you ?<br />
<br />
If you keep telling yourself that the only thing you can do is Tank, then you won't ever fill your shoes fully.<br />
<br />
Try to think a little outside the box, ok ?<br />
<br />
&quot;If warriors do not want to share that position then where exactly does that leave paladins that you guys want to nerf so badly?&quot;<br />
We want you to be what you were meant to be, Tanks if there's noone better in the group (say, if the maintank dies ?) , addtank if needed and whetever else sort of utility you have at hand.<br />
<br />
Your advantage should BE utility - NOT - raw tanking ability.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First off if its merely resisted - I'd still be somewhat pissed if it could land on me (for an example lets say your in body armor and you get shot at but either the bullet miss's you or armor asorbs it, but it could really hurt, i'd be pissed or want to kill that person... of course problby not if i was flat out immune to it)...<br />
<br />
However far too many mobs are simply immune (even to /65 Stun)<br />
Which I assume is mostly for balance reasons, if you could land stuns on raid mobs reliable or (66+ you could make them pretty easily if you had a bunch of people chaing 5-12 second etc stuns on them)... so they just make it flat out immune via level..... (a few mobs types - notable giants and draggongs are just flat out immune) (admitly not for xp groups as much but still some areas)<br />
<br />
If they somehow balanced it so stuns could land on more mobs - espcailly higher level ones, then sure make lesser aggro on resisted - or no aggro on immune, but having them do no aggro, because of game balance and mechanic issues (not being able to stun cause of level to avoid overpowing) isnt too &quot;fair&quot;...<br />
<br />
I think it would be sorta cool if when i tried to stun a mob that is flat out immune (Real immune like dragon) hes like fuck off i dont care....  (although then also do it for other things... ie no aggro on unsnarable mobs  from snares.... or hell, if you dont speak the mobs language taunt doesnt work ahha or if hes death etc etc...<br />
<br />
i sorta rambled but i think main reason resisted/immune spells are still aggro because they are immune for balance reasons not as much for mob design /shrug</div></div><hr />

<br />
-But-<br />
<br />
Some MOBs where not designed to be tanked by Paladins and Warriors are supposed to be the better dealing and taking Melee damage !<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Personally, I would love to have MOBs that did Unholy damage which Knights could be immune to, thus making Knights be better for those MOBs.<br />
<br />
I'd also love to have some other mobs that would totally ignore all avoidance skills and deal Holy Damage, which warriors could be immune to, but would hit Knights hard - Basically a MOB that is about straight up raw mitigation.<br />
<br />
And finally one could make a MOB that totally ignores mitigation by letting them deal 1 melee damage and 500 proc damage (think Venril Sathir type here), but not so good at hitting characters, so that a character with high avoidance skills would be the preferred tank .. like .. say, a Monk ?<br />
<br />
<br />
But until something like that happens and appropiate aggro spells are introduced, nerf immune spells, nerf them hard - Because they severely unbalance the game and it makes no sense. And put in some other spells to make sure you can still hold aggro by using that mana pool of yours.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Madronedorf, you've come really close to describing how I would work spell aggro, with my magic developer's wand.  And fwiw, it's not to fix warriors, or balance knights to me, but because I think that it would be better game design.  As many warriors do, I feel that making knights non-viable to MT for XP groups is out of the question.  That no tank class should be categorically more preferrable to another, although situational advantages are appropriate.<br />
<br />
It's already been pointed out that the Provoke series scales across levels (for good reasons).  I think a design for spell aggro (including weapon procs) that echoes that makes perfect sense and would be a design improvement - even if all there is to that mechanism is 0 aggro for spells the mob is immune to.<br />
<br />
Heh ... the language &amp; taunt notion is pretty funny.  It would give me a reason to have learned all those languages (although Provoke currently uses universal sign language on test ;)).</div></div><hr />

The only issue that I haven't seen raised in this discussion is the fact that ALOT of weapons use some form of Stun to allow warrior to hold aggro.<br />
Blackout for one, the effect is a stunn proc, where I get lots of IMMUNE Mesages.<br />
If they fix this I would be damned pissed that suddenly my weapon of choice for Off hand didn't function the way it has been for over a year now...</div></div><hr />

We know what monster traits would make it a pain for Warriors to tank.  We know what monster traits would make it a pain for Paladins to tank.  Why aren't there a better mix of these in the game?<br />
<br />
I mentioned before that it isn't strong agro generation that makes the game boring and unchallenging.  Its the stupid AI on monsters.  You can predict the behavior at each and every encounter.  Tanks with solid agro generation are just doing their expected job and should not be punished.  Being angry at tanks holding agro is like being angry at an Enchanter because they are doing a stellar job at CC.<br />
<br />
I would love to see better AI built into monsters.  Monsters should have likes and dislikes built into them where players take them into consideration.  Some monsters should be dumb as rocks (is that a pun?) but some should be smarter.  An intelegent giant monster isn't going to care if that Paladin tapping them or can't even hear the Warrior down at its feet but is sure going to notice when the SK gives it a DOT hotfoot. ^_^ Hopefully it isn't too late for smart monsters.</div></div><hr />

If you are running out of mana casting a level 9 or 15 spell (at a cost of 15 mana) then you suck.  Even in average gear and *gasp* kei  you be able to cast it at virtually no cost.  Don't come here spewing crap you clearly don;t understand.  If you go back to the first few posts you will also see that the developers see there is a discrepancy between your mana cost and aggro generated; is that me a warrior crying nerf . . . no that is a developer making a valid observation that you clearly are too blinded to see.  <br />
<br />
I also didn;t say remove all hate, but yes just like our aggro &quot;spell&quot; your stuns hate sould scale with level and cost and be similar to a warrior.  Paladin's will still be very viable tanks, they just won;t be the only tanks that can control a mob anymore . . . guess that's too much for you to handle huh.  Lets not mention the FACT that Paladin's, SK's, Shaman, Enchanter, and Cleric boards all said that Warriors needed better aggro . . . i guess we shouldn;t complain at all  . . . your solution would have been what exactly??<br />
<br />
do everyone a favor and stfu and go back to your little hole in PoN, where you all cry.  It's not to much to have your spell cost vs aggro generated is it, especially when SOE IS DOING THE TWEAKING NOT WARRIORS!!!!</div></div><hr />

No wonder why every class tharak and all you other warriors call u nothing more than the king of bitching. You got ur spells, you have your 'openingings' you have more mitigation , hps , dps. Just leave it at that. A lvl 9 spell causes aggro and well it should .. should your lower lvl aggro generator work on higher lvls ? NO... yes i here you all now asking ' why not little johhny paladin can cast a lvl 9 spell for aggro boo hoo i want to too !!! Well sorry your not a spell caster ur not casting a spell !! You want your low lvl stuff to work on high lvl mobs ? Then give something up lower ur skill caps , give up your new heal 'spell' , lower your dps, hps or better yet how about u reroll and make a Knight.

One more thing before you start crying like a little 5 year old who lost his lollipop. this would not send Paladins &quot;back to Kunark&quot;(though imo I had no probs grouping with them then), all being said is make mobs not so ignorant on a purely overpowered ability of Pallies to cast a super low mana spell to agro lock. I love Incite, is it the end all for agro? no still need others to pay attention, the same should be said for when Paladins agro mobs.</div></div><hr />

I had a reply for hundist, but then i re-read it and figured that he would never be able to grasp anything written above the 3rd grade reading level.  <br />
<br />
I'lll just say one thing more, yes low level stuns that cost virtually no mana are a little overpowered . . . and the developers are looking into it.  Just stfu and be glad warriors are not the developers, because after reading all your drivel i think kunark was to good to you.</div></div><hr />

Many who chain Cease are blind to the fact you not only want agro, you want the monster to continue to stand there in front of you for as long as possible.  Cease plainly doesn't do that.<br />

The only real reason left to use Cease against high level monsters is to pull.  At that rate you could throw a rock at the monster for the same effect.

I am certainly glad the aggro values are being looked at, as well as mana costs.  I just think aggro lock is a horrible idea on a tank.  If a wizard wants aggro lock then let them have it (more power to them).  In the case we have at present paladin chains a stun spell and the mob is glued on them with about 0 chance at moving, it hurts the game it hurts balance . . . and it's plain stupid.  I am glad the developers gave me better aggro capabilities, and glad i did not get aggro lock.  Aggro locking on a tank class just makes encounters way to trivial.<br />
<br />
Honestly I don;t know what the developers are going to do about the low level stuns, honestly I don;t care as long as they fix things so aggro locking is not possible anymore.  I really don;t care to see paladin;s nerfed (or Sk's) well except for 2 anyhow . . . . think the developers can rig a nerf for just hundist, and newtank?  <br />
<br />
Oh and in case hundist is reading this again . . . I am glad the changes are up to developers who are trying to make things fair, not whinny warriors or beligerant paladin's ;oP</div></div><hr />

<br />
And let me say this :<br />
The Paladin could cast low level stuns continiously without running out of mana and he only had FT1 from a Solstice earring + KEI buff.<br />
<br />
Spel immunities should severely decrease the aggro generated by a spell the MOB is immune to, no matter the level of the spell.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you want to kill Pally aggro, then you should deplete your own aggro on certain mobs as well.<br />
<br />
I'm not a pally, I really could care less. Complaining about their aggro, when yours just went thru leaps and bounds forward... is really not called for anymore.</div></div><hr />

Banuk obviously doesnt play a war either :P hehehehe<br />
<br />
Incite has helped but, aggro was fine for me before the changes, now its just a little more solid.</div></div><hr />

A lot of folx think that aggro from a 9th level spell - or a weapon that procs a 9th level spell - should be softened or eliminated.   I'm one ... and it's not about my class vs. anyone else's class.  I don't play against anyone else; most of the tanks in our wee guild are knights anyway.  Some of us don't give a damn who stands taller than anyone else, we just want to play a better game.  A lot of those people are the paladins and shadow knights who cheered along with the warriors when our aggro got a love tap in the right direction.<br />
<br />
I shouldn't be able to aggro a mob with my Silken Whip of Ensaring (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=5643) if it is immune to changes in its run speed.  I shouldn't still be able to use my Sarnak Warhammer (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=6613) in my offhand for aggro at level 64.  What should happen is the MOB turns to me, sneers and gives me the finger, then picks out the group healer, the group CC'er, and the group evaccer, rapes them all in that order, then OOC's my name across all zones so that it is known that I am too lazy and stupid to play my class well, or use paragraphs.  But that's just one man's opinion.<br />
<br />
One of the best thing about Provoke (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4608&amp;source=Live), from a design standpoint, is that it scales up.  On a level 65 mob, there is no reason at all for me to use it when I have access to Incite (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4697&amp;source=Live). I can see no reason whatsoever to feel any differently than I ever have, that spell generated aggro scales inappropriately as the levels of encounters raise.  And that the SK hate spells need to work properly too ;).<br />
<br />
/agree Celestias and all t'others who think that there is time for such things to be examined while the current (and continuing) changes are watched and/or tweaked.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That way the spell would still give the same aggro if the MOB is not immune to it. And Paladins / SK's could simply use level appropiate spells and still have excellent aggro.<br />
Some spells might have their mana adjusted a bit, and perhaps some new spells added to make them more interesting ... new types of heals / lifetaps sounds appropiate.<br />
<br />
Oh, and I'm all for having a few choice encounters that are immune to +Hate spells/abilities, but aggroes insanely on Stuns. The majority should not be immune to +Hate though, that would defeat the whole purpose of the new balance.<br />
<br />
Having more different encounters would be fun. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Banuk</div><div class="date">12-30-2003, 08:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">never played a Pally. I've no idea what level stuns they use for aggro, though i hear for the most part, they use a 62? or 63? level spell, once that spell level is availalble to them.<br />
<br />
Stuns not causing aggro because of immunity. What else in a Pally's spell book causes high aggro(regardles of the type of mob/what zone its in) on demand? Chaining root I could see potential there...<br />
<br />
All that I know about spell agro is.... tashani takes the cake, over 1 stun, 1 darkness, or 1 fear.<br />
<br />
I'm assuming that Pally agro would be quite dead if stun's no longer caused it. If they have other means of it... I'm simply uninformed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anker steadfast</div><div class="date">12-30-2003, 08:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think that for a single aggro spell, Ensnare is probably the most potent as it is. However, it also have longer casttime than most stuns.<br />
<br />
What we want nerfed is spells they are immune to, if he's using a level 62 spell, then the MOB will most likely not be immune to it and therefore should get full aggro from it.<br />
<br />
The problem, game balance wise, is when they can use a 15 mana spell that was never meant to be used for aggro, more successfully than pretty much everything else and can be chaincasted forever with KEI on without even moving the Manabar.<br />
Which is the case with the lowest level stun and fear spell.<br />
<br />
That ought to be rectified.<br />
Because it's not balanced.<br />
<br />
And yes, root have potential .. heals also generate a fair amount of aggro. But far and large, it's the stuns that give them aggro. Snare and DOTs for the SK .. and their +Hate spells too I guess.</div></div><hr />

That would hurt warriors more than pallys.  A pally can at least use his higher level spells, but what about the warriors with droga weapons?  GBoS, blackout, yak procs, norge'tal, bbote, SoD, GSoT, etc.  (yes gsot and sotbs go up to 65, but many non exp mobs are above 65).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">12-31-2003, 06:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If the weapons that proc stuns that mobs are immune to (i.e. Ykesha and a whole mess of other stuff) are supposed to be used for aggro, then they can either make it a stun 0.0/65 (which is effectively doing nothing, but now it effects the mob), or just replace the stun with something like increase hate by 300.  It seems to me that stuns are meant to be aggro getters.  Our class weapon from Time, after all, procs a stun on top of +hate.  But if not, I don't mind if everything is revamped, as long as it's in a consistent way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeka</div><div class="date">12-31-2003, 04:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No Banuk, Paladins would still have control.   I've got 8 + many more spots to excirse a skill to generate agro.  Nerfing one avenue makes one use another.<br />
<br />
Nerfing stuns will only make low end Paladins suffer.  High end Paladins move on creating agro just like before.  High HP Beastlords and Rangers get invited to more often to tank.  Is that a good fix or what?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">12-31-2003, 04:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Force of Akilae isn't free unlike Cease or Desist.  A non high end Paladin will actually run out of mana if you've to use Force of Akilae as much as they used to with the other stuns.<br />
<br />
Of course, Force of Akilae is probably too cheap for what it does, so I think a high end Paladin can still chain Force of Akilae, but that's another issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rueeliar</div><div class="date">12-31-2003, 05:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Force of Akilae<br />
1s casting time<br />
2.2s gem refresh time<br />
12s recast time.<br />
<br />
One stun every 15s doesn't sound like &quot;chain-casting&quot; to me.  They could try to mix it up with QWoS, but that has a 24 second recast, so that doesn't work well, either...  Neither affect mobs over 65.  Root is something mobs tend to be immune to in many situations.  Heals that do not heal damage are laughable aggro...<br />
<br />
So essentially, that would leave a paladin with their pathetic melee to generate aggro in many situations.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because pallies have had snap aggro for so long there is no way in hell you could take that away from them.</div></div><hr />
