<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Babyblade</div><div class="date">05-27-2003, 01:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am currently a prospect for a guild, and their rules require a setup to attain 100 in every resistance, without the aid of buffs. What are the best items to get while still having a good AC and HP? Reaver and Imbued Granite Spaulders are the only decent items I can come up with. <br />
<br />
I have about 20k to spend ... I know prices vary through servers, but differences in jewelry shouldn't be that high. Any help would be greatly appreciated!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">05-27-2003, 02:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">most ppl keep a bag for resist gear, normally u arent taking direct melee dmg and just trying to resist aes. most apps post what they can get their resist to, not what they are with their best hp or ac gear. you could try posting both i suppose<br />
<br />
jewelry craft bracers, earrings, rings, and a froggy crown should set u up ok. indo boots and bracers(no drop tho) arent bad items either.<br />
<br />
i think you will find many warriors running around in deity armor unless they are in ele planes and the stuff has no resist. really they are going to be more concerned with your total ac/hp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khazthet</div><div class="date">05-27-2003, 05:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I also highly suggest the guardian's leggings in SS if you can kill there or have another kill for you, 15svf/svc is difficult to beat, and you still dont loose too much stats.<br />
Besides that, froggy crown, the spear from upper guk that has 10svf/svc/svm which is range equippable, indicolite boots, velium diamond rings, velium blue diamond bracer/earrings/masks and you will probably be set :)<br />
If you have more money, cultural bracer are good too, or even UP bracers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">QuirtEvans</div><div class="date">05-27-2003, 06:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Most guilds don't require you to have 100 in all resists at the same time, usually they just want you to get to 100 in magic while you are at 100 in each of the other resists, one at a time.  The point is, you can go for stuff that just has high DR, and you don't need to have high FR and CR at the same time.  It means you have to have a greater number of resist items, but I think it's the more cost effective way to go.  <br />
<br />
On to the recommendations.<br />
<br />
Personally, I won't wear any BD crap.  You give up too many other stats when you wear BD stuff.  You're a warrior, chances are you're going to get hit, so taking less damage from AoE but getting slapped around by melee damage doesn't seem like a particularly wonderful trade-off to me.  I try to find resist gear that won't cost me too much in terms of AC or HP.  <br />
<br />
I agree that the UP bracers are a good choice.<br />
<br />
The runed bone fork is good, and it's very cheap.  10 to SVF, SVM, SVC, from memory.  A good alternative in the range slot if you're OK on SVF and SVC is the Nightmarewood compound bow, which has 15 SVM on it.  <br />
<br />
As someone mentioned, the crown of the froglok kings has 20 SVF, 20 SVC on it.  Circlet of Vallon is an alternative, it has better AC (I have a tough time losing all the AC the froggy crown would cost me) and has 7 SVF, SVD, SVC on it.  <br />
<br />
Helm of Raldukan, which can also be regular gear, has 7 SVC, SVD on it.  <br />
<br />
One of the better resist items is imbued granite spaulders.  20 AC and 10 to all saves.  Regular gear for me.  <br />
<br />
Tracking wolf collar is a decent neck piece and has 10 SVC on it.  <br />
<br />
The stone visor, if you can get it to drop in ME, is a really really nice face piece, and has 7 SVD, SVC, SVP on it.  This has the benefit of being regular gear for me, not just resist gear (20 AC, 10 STR, 10 AGI).  You can switch out to a peerless dragonhide mask (13 AC, 7 SVF) if you really need that SVF sometime.   Or you can switch out to the coral adorned mask, 15 SVM, 15 SVF, from Nadox.<br />
<br />
There is stuff from Fungus Grove that boosts disease resistance a lot.  One example is the mushroom veil, it has 15 SVD on it.  I would never wear that one because of all the other stats I'd lose, but if you have to demonstrate 100 in SVD in the backpack it's an option.  <br />
<br />
Electrified earring of tempests is also regular gear for me, 12 SVM, SVF, SVC.<br />
<br />
Necklace of curled cacti is not expensive (a little more than 1K), has 12 SVF, SVM, SVC on it.   <br />
<br />
The resist I have the most trouble with is poison.  I seem to have an easy time finding FR gear, the PR stuff doesn't jump out at me.</div></div><hr />

normally if you are tanking, you dont wear resist gear at all. if you are in ntov farming armor for instance, the tank would still go all out ac/hp. PR is mainly gotten from that BD crap. if you are in pop trying to resist 3k procs from MM, you better have a bard heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Estebar</div><div class="date">05-28-2003, 03:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since you're recruiting, I don't think you will need to worry about being main tank and having resists together for a while.<br />
<br />
My recommendation is to get the requirements first, then start from there to work toward a set of gear you really like.<br />
<br />
I'm gonna assume that it's single resist+magic.  Fire/cold and poison/disease are paired for resists a lot.<br />
<br />
Looks like IGS, velium bd bracelets, froglok crown/tarmok headband, holy cake, kaladim constitutional should get you there using the reaver.<br />
<br />
After that, you can do stuff like swap out for full mithril or luminant heraldic bracers, tweak out different setups.</div></div><hr />
