<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Windmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I, for one, am personally boycotting anything that has a Sony name attached to it. I do not need their TV's, DVD players, CD players, cameras, audio amps, or anything else they make. Other companies make similar products and show more respect to their customers then they do.<br />
<br />
Do this and then send an e-mail to the parent company stating why.  Lets see how long it takes to fix SOE's broken customer service.<br />
<br />
Windmoon:cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Unfortunately, Sony Poducts are really good. Their cutomer sevice for any items in the electronics field have been nothing short of stellar.<br />
<br />
Boycotting Sony over EQ?  Kinda pushing the limits isn't it?   :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Windmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thats my point.  They will wonder what is going on and come to find out.  You are so right about Sony, their products and customer service overall is very good.  For them to get information that one of their subsideriaes is ruining their good name WILL get a response from them.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">But the big dog Sony could care less IMHO about how it runs it's CS for one of their 'offshoot' companies ( Sony /= SoE ) about 'gaming issues' over 'class imbalance'...No offense and all but EQ isn't that big of a deal :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Windmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Having worked for a Fortune 500 company, I can assure you that they pay attention when one of their subsidiaries is ruining their good name.  Try it and see.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Smakz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Sony isnt gonna do jack with SoE ... why ... because SoE continues to make profit for Sony.  <br />
<br />
And like it or not, they know they still corner the market with MMORPGs.  <br />
<br />
Profit = success in the business world, and EQ is still the #1 MMORPG, that = profit.  In Sony eyes, EQ = Profit.<br />
<br />
They arnt gonna give a shit if a handfull of whiny customers go to another game.  Because brother, you'll be back, they always come back.  Some people may stay away a little longer, but they come back regardless.<br />
<br />
EQ is far from dead, and that handful of us that protests about a game, that is successful in all other aspects means very little to the guys in suits.  <br />
<br />
They will continue to do things this way, and they wont stop, why you ask, because they still make money. <br />
<br />
That is the bottom line ..<br />
<br />
File a class action lawsuit might get their attention.<br />
<br />
But then, they are protected in the EULA from such actions, you clicked accept when you logged on.  You clicked submit when they asked for your Credit Card.  Thats all they care about, and anything you do or say isnt gonna matter, they already have your money, your yelling at a brick wall.</div></div><hr />
