<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Crathsor Gnawbones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wanted to place my frustrations here along with finding out if this has happened to anyone else recently.<br />
<br />
I did the turn-in for the gauntlets of the myrmidon with Jendavudd in Skyshrine.  Am max ally with CoV and gave him the unadorned plat gaunts and 3 unstacked crushed topaz.  That no good for nothing wyvern stared at me and I got two things in return...Jack and Shyt...and Jack left town.<br />
<br />
I mean a simple /finger to me would of been interesting but I got nothing!!!<br />
<br />
So I wanted to vent here along with seeing if Jendavudd is being a schmuck to anyone else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">He might have had some quest items on him already ... I usually hand in 4 flasks of water first, to clear the queue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Krambar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If Jendavudd did have some quest items  on him , wouldn`t  he have given the item to the player if it was the correct components, or gave him back his pieces ?<br />

We rock at reading comprehension today!<br />
and 3 unstacked crushed topaz.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dintorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Sounds like a bug.  Did you /petition?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Crathsor Gnawbones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Aye I did a petition on it and was answered by a Senior guide on the server.  He's stated that the case had to be escalated to a GM status and if I didn't hear back from them that evening to do a petition again the next day.<br />
<br />
So the evening dragged on and didn't hear squat from any GM.  Now with the new day in hand  I not only did a new petition I emailed the gm of my server as well.<br />
<br />
So now I must wait to see if the GM is gonna assist me or say<br />
<br />
Suxxors to be Joo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">No offense or anything, but there is a very high probablity that you screwed up something.  Quests these days just aren't broken..they're not.  There was a time when people complained about losing hard earned time on legitimately bugged quests, but they've done a lot of good things with quest NPCs, and that shit just doesn't happen anymore.<br />
<br />
Quest givers with items in the queue will return your items to you, or they will complete the quest with the parts of your items that completed the quest and keep the rest.  I've done literally probably 150 SS/Thugadin quests and multiquests for the guild and I've never, ever, had one fail.<br />
<br />
Even if you had handed in the incorrect items, he would have given them back to you.  The only way a quest NPC should eat your quest items is if your faction wasn't high enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">He said he is max ally. So he's a liar ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Mystaviant</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I have to agree with Haass, which is usually the case anyway - hard to argue with his blunt, but nearly rock-solid points. <br />
<br />
If he had items in the queue, he would have simply given odd messages as he recieved each item, and at the last one he would have gave you the guantlets.<br />
<br />
Skyshrine is one of the more popular quest areas even today, and I would find it VERY odd for SoE to have broken quests there.  I can't remember the last time I have heard of a legitimatly broken quest.  Hell, I think the qeynos badge quests are the most broke atm, as the part where you have the guy follow you doesnt work at all, but you can still do the quest if you give him the right items, so even the broken quests still work.<br />
<br />
Were you sneaking?  Were you invis? Did you use any faction modifying items? Are you sure you are max ally?<br />
<br />
And my last question:  Were you smart enough to hail the NPC and make sure he would give you the quest prompt BEFORE you did the hand in??  100 plat says you didnt do that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
this is meaningless in velious. they give you the quest before you have the faction level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tasso</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">they give you the quest before you have the faction level <br />
<br />
not the armor guys. My cleric would go and check every now and then. Very High warmly is all you need for it. <br />
<br />
before warmly he would not give me the quest.<br />
<br />
its probably a bug. the gm will hook you up... of course you will probably be in full elemental by the time that happens.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Khazzuz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">On a similar occurence, a wizard in my guild recently turned in the quest pieces for silk leggings in SS.  Same circumstances, max ally, gems unstacked.  She's done multiple turn ins before so while I was there but can't actually verify she gave the NPC the items unstacked odds are high she did it correctly, she did hail the NPC and get the quest first too.  She got about the same thing in return: squat.  I'm inclined to think something is a bugged considering this is not the first occurence I've heard of this.  Granted, I have never had a problem with a turn in, so I'm going merely on heresay and my confidence that my guildy knows what they're doing.  <br />
<br />
This happened a week ago now, still no answer from the GMs for her, and she has repetitioned a few times.  Hope this problem works itself out quicker for you than her.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">He said he is max ally. So he's a liar ? <br />
<br />
I'm not callng him a liar.  I believe that he thinks he did everything right, but I'll bet a walkthru of the events would show where he messed it up.  Quests just aren't broken anymore...the first couple years this game was out they were...and hot damn, they were, but they're just not anymore.<br />
<br />
this is meaningless in velious. they give you the quest before you have the faction level. <br />
<br />
If there are people in velious who do this, I haven't seen them.  Go hail Leuz for the Benevolence quest at glower..he tells you where you can shove your work.<br />
<br />
Like I said, if something was broken, it'd be far more widespread than one guy on the warrior boards.  I MQ'd a set of plate greaves like a week ago and didn't have any issues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Go hail Kardakor in GD Haass. he does give quest info when you actually dont have the required faction. that starts at amiably already I think. Of course dubiosly wont work...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">/shrug...even if you found one guy who does give you the quest early, that doesn't make the entire expansion that way, so you're wrong :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">like you are right regarding the first poster ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I'd fuckin put money on the fact that I'm right...he fucked up something.  Quests are not fucking broken anymore, period.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Same for the other person that did lots of SS turn ins before?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Sorguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">The more you do a quest the less caring you get about doing turn in properly<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
That is all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">on the positive note GMs usually able to give you the items back and explain what went wrong. Make absolutley sure that you get a hold of GM within a week of this thought otherwise you'll get &quot;sorry we cant help you&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Crathsor Gnawbones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Nothing new has come about this as of yet.  The GM from my server apparently is on vacation or playing StarWars Galaxies or something.  The bright side I heard back from the initial guide I spoke to about the problem so I can go through it with him step by step as to what I did.<br />
<br />
Yes I did hail Jendavudd and did every single step correctly.  From what I am told this has just happened to 3 more people on the server on various armor pieces from the same NPC.<br />
<br />
Quest more than likely isn't broken yet the NPC sure as hell is.<br />
<br />
So I had to submit a bug report now along with the re-addressal of my petition.<br />
<br />
At this point and time I might as well say screw it cuz as the last person said if I don't get a GM with-in a wekk I'll probably get the response of sorry we can't help you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">If i still had Ally faction I'd go quest up some shit in my bank for ya, but I'm down to Kindly and it's likely to stay that way...damned Telk hehe.<br />
<br />
If I work faction on my weekend coming up here I'll give it a go tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Crathsor Gnawbones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Well after roughly talking to 4 guides, 2 Staff GM's I was contacted by a Senior GM about the turn-in.<br />
<br />
End result: Got the unadorned gauntlets back and the crushed topaz.<br />
<br />
Of course my faction is currently screwed up from killing a bunch of dragons in WW for their necklace and just to spite them for the torture of my troll mind.<br />
<br />
Which isn't very much for a troll</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">lol. I have a bunch of SS stuff in the bank, but I will never, ever, ever go back to those quest idiots again in my lifetime.<br />
<br />
Not for plat, not for guildies, not for anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Then why is it in your bank?  If you really had no intention, you wouldn't have even bothered looting or would have destroyed it :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">It's about 2 years old now. I was just going to MQ it for people since my faction was always maxed, then people raced past needing it, and it just sat there and sat there and sat there.<br />
<br />
I have a hard time destroying anything lol.<br />
<br />
We're talking bracers and helm and stuff btw. Not really anything to get fired up over lol.<br />
<br />
I *might* go there if it was a BP and a guildie needed, but that would  be a stretch.... :)<br />
<br />
P.S. I am sad that HoT got pushed into obsolescence. HoT was the greatest thing ever, especially before the days of Paci pulling etc.<br />
<br />
Do you remember the battles when you were low level just trying to get one wurm at a time?<br />
<br />
Either having or not having a monk that understood the pull, people being too close to mobs during pull, trying to get one solo as a 60 warrior for the first time with no FD puller....<br />
<br />
Those were the days, boy I tell yah.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Yeah, I remember those days.  Now i play the chanter and druid while one of my buddies plays his warrior and we go clear about half of the area in the respawn time.    Still a fine stop off for gearing up the lower end people since BoT is a fuckin cesspool.  SS armor isn't that far behind, and the drop rate is far better than Ornate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Gharghael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Last time I went to HoT we had a druid pulling! I think it's still a great place for learning raid tactics, and isn't so difficult that you can take 1 solid group, along with whatever other stragglers, have a good time, show some people the ropes, and get some armor drops. It's just a pain getting people to work on faction these days &gt;.&lt; Everyone wants to go PoJ-&gt;PoI-&gt;PoN-&gt;PoD-&gt;PoV-&gt;BoT these days...<br />
<br />
Kael? What's that and can a druid use it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
um they revamped AC and broke the ring of fire, and a few quests based on that zone, and because its old content it still isnt fixed after.... 5 months (i think)<br />
<br />
as SoE has said before fixes are done in order of what is most complained about.<br />
<br />
as for the skyshrine thing i dont see how that bug happend :/ sorry for the loss of time and effort<br />
<br />
at least the first poster got the parts back</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I said I was gonna do it when I got CoV faction back, and I finally had a reason to go try it.  Quest seems to work fine to me.</div></div><hr />
