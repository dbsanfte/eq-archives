We had 2 of our guild members taken hostage by an Insane Imp... and he drug them from zone to zone in SoV and I think RoK.  Finally after moving 3 zones or so, he stopped and awarded a bunch of people loot.  I think he handed out something like 10-20 items.<br />
<br />
They included:<br />
<br />
Guise of the Deceiver<br />
Rubicite armor (all pieces, some useless ones like boots, etc given to wizards, boggle)<br />
Box of Abu'kar<br />
<br />
There were no Manastones awarded.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've got a full set of Rubicite on my bazaar mule cleric that's worthless to sell, only reason i've kept it.  It's not even good twink armor anymore.<br />
<br />
The manastone works in about 6 zones now, so that's complete shit.<br />
<br />
The Guise has been made totally obsolete by Project Illusion.<br />
<br />
Bladestorm?  Pff.  Earthshaker is where it's at.  <br />
<br />
I'm can't remember anything else that would even be worth an hour of my time to get.</div></div><hr />

It works great for LDoN adventures. You can use them just outside all the dungeons.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, druids and wizards have been using them since Kunark came out because they can just port back to the old world, stone down and gate to where they were, and with the advent of PoK, I'd wager it got even easier to use a stone for most people.  It's still rather low on the usefulness scale these days.  How long you gotta click a stone to fill up a 6k mana cleric? :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
Remember the 400 mana for Complete Heal is about 20 clicks.<br />
<br />
That is only 1200 Hit Points.<br />
<br />
All other hps above that are free mana.<br />
<br />
A buffed cleric with a 6k mana pool can easily get to 5000-6000 or more hps.<br />
<br />
That is 4800 hit points or 1600 mana. <br />
<br />
At that rate, it only takes about 4 Complete Heals to get full up.<br />
<br />
That is 40 seconds.<br />
<br />
You can click the hell out of that stone too. I have one still and it basically can drain 4000-5000 hit points in about 4 or 5 seconds :)<br />
<br />
Manastones are the bomb. They weren't that unbalancing nowadays with AA's and FT, etc...<br />
<br />
They should un-nerf the little bastards :)</div></div><hr />

so is like the assasin in guk dropping a DE mask useable by all this week ?  Nope - they're only being handed out at GM events.</div></div><hr />

It's like canni, except they can self-buff to 5k+ (my clerics hits 4.5k and he's not even uber) and CH. The fact that it's instaclick makes it even easier.</div></div><hr />

I arrived to see a few named bloodgills running around on the shore, obviously GM controlled.  Then a water dragon (like the one in TD, but bigger) popped out of the lake!<br />
<br />
Well, after a good hour of figuring out how to kill them (a low level player had to get inside a building a kill a certain mob before the rest could be killed), I ended up with a Blade of the Black Dragon Eye (14/24 1HS and Envenomed Breath Proc)!  While I was there with my Monk, it'll make a great addition to my weapons for my 39 warrior I'm working on now.<br />
<br />
Very cool!  Good Karma I guess for dealing much death to the giants in Kael.</div></div><hr />

This is why GM events are inherently flawed. People should get crap they can actually use, not something for their twinks for something to sell in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mokor Leadheaad</div><div class="date">09-27-2003, 03:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yep last one i was it i was participate and doing good then bam i couldnt fight anymore. turns out people logged on the 40,50 twinks and the gm adjusted the level to match the people working on the event. so after beating on ungodly hp scarecrow for 15 min. i no longer got to play. add to that people wern't rewarded for participation they were awarded for being the first to ninja the corpse.<br />
<br />
i defintly had fun at the time, but in hindsight i could have worked on sence heading or something.</div></div><hr />

<br />
/boggle...<br />
<br />
Actually, I could have brought down my Warrior (who's more than an alt...I play on FV so it's a whole separate account) but I happened to be on my monk when it happened, so I just ran him down, not knowing what to expect.  This event was anything but flawed.  The mobs weren't too high in level, and it even required a lower level player to finish the encounter, who was awarded a nifty gnome illusion mask if I remember correctly.  <br />
<br />
So I'd say the weapon is definitely something I'd use for quite a while, not something I plan on selling.  Guildies also got great upgrades in that fight, including a Belt of the Great Turtle and a Brell's Girdle.  <br />
<br />
Loot was very much in line, both with the levels needed to do the event, and the levels represented there.  And it surely outweight the risk...zero xp loss deaths make dying so painless.<br />
<br />
I'm unsure if you mean that they should have been dropping BoC's and Ornate stuff, or they should have been dropping rusty daggers.  But to me, seemed that the drops were ok.  But more importantly, it was FUN!  And so was the other GM event I attended earlier that week in Dreadlands (Giant doggies attacking KC), where loot wasn't nearly as good and was significantly harder.<br />
<br />
Oh well, can't please everyone...</div></div><hr />

I dunno if I should've laughed of the ppl dying to a naked GM with a rusty sword killing them or puked.....<br />
Jesus... come on.... its for the freaking fun of it... like paladiin said, it was FUN!... but 70% of the zone didnt seem to care</div></div><hr />
