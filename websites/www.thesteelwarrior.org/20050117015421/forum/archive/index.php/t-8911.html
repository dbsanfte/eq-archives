<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dacke</div><div class="date">09-16-2004, 03:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Close to zone in there is a nice skelly that we used as pet, hits for 152 and we kept pulling mobs to him with me standing around to keep the attention of the mobs while that charmed pet killed em, mobs dropped in seconds so xp was fast, think the mobs name was war boned something, from entrance the mob will be on a platform just on the other side of the wall once you go trough the first  gate.<br />
<br />
Died a few times but still made over a level, we did have a 65 cleric and 65 mage there, i was 37 also had a 31 shaman and 30 something necro, chanter was 40 something, the cleric did heal me wich of course was a must, mage did toss a ds on me from time to time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">09-16-2004, 06:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe look for a better duo if you're not looking for downtime.<br />
<br />
Warrior/necro kinda reeks of downtime.  If you haven't hit it yet, you will.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mendler</div><div class="date">09-16-2004, 03:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Do not use Cob bp for down time.  You need to sit with fungi on and bandage.  The Cobalt bp is a waste of time.  If it were we with that duo, I would go Veksar and kill the undead near zone in.  You need have lots of room to pull with necro so fd pull with snare.    Once you have single slow him fear him dot him and send in pet and pet warrior.  Exp will be rolling in, I promise.  I think the necro will get their best slow at lvl 56 so you might want to wait.  Doing this method you will have minimal down time just to med for the necro.  If you are killing fast enough with out dotting, you can save mana for pulling and let pets do all the dmg.  Fear kiting is every warrior/necro friend because the lack of healing.  If you need to just have the warrior tank it while you med, fear kiting &gt; all with this duo.<br />
<br />
Dulak boats are a good source of pp and decent exp.  I used to fear kite the last two boats solo at 56 to 60 on my necro.  It's a fun zone give it a try.<br />
<br />
Just my 2cps worth.<br />

<br />
Veksar has some nice drops for sure and the few times i been in there it has been loads of fun.</div></div><hr />
