<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tkyle</div><div class="date">07-11-2004, 08:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello all, first post here.  =)   I've got a question on weapons. I'm using a Copper Hammer of Striking at the moment (13/20) ratio and has 175dd on it. I'm wondering how much the proc. figures in. I'm looking at the new 1hs Velium Gemmed Long Sword. It's (16/20) ratio. I know it's more dmg. but when you add the proc in on the Copper hammer how does this compare?<br />
<br />
 Thanks for any feedback.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikken</div><div class="date">07-11-2004, 08:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If your going for agro, take the CHoS. Nothing incites my anger more that people using it for DPS, seems like everyday I'm explaining to idiot_ranger01 that it is an agro weapon and should not be used for DPS. Drives me nuts to have to fight agro with some random DPS class to switch weapons from stun procs and whatnot.<br />
<br />
The velium weapon wins, hands down on DPS. It has an excelent ratio and its very fast to maximize that mainhand ratio. But more to the point of your question, no, the ChoS proc will not make up for that extra DMG, especially on high level mobs where resists wil be much more common. Its not completely cut and dried, but if pure DPS is your concern, you would be best suited with the velium for low agro DPS.<br />
<br />
I'm sure some will disagree with me, and say that the MT should worry about agro, if he's having problems then thats his fault. Ofcourse I'm also usually inclined to explain my issue with the weapon and after that if they take agro, they keep it. Usually after one or 2 times of them running around screaming for a heal (because I told the cleric to not to heal him if he takes agro willingly after having explained it to them) I find that they can usually procure another suitable combo with which to provide agro free DPS. This is coming for mid-50s experience groups that I usually MT for, and most of the time get compliments on my ability of sustain agro. (I guess noone knows how to use provoke/taunt correctly, or at least not in common knowledge.) My server is a bit slow I guess. Once a week I still come across a tank or melee that doesn't know about the revised disc system and/or the provoke line.<br />
<br />
But thats far enough off topic I suppose...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tkyle</div><div class="date">07-11-2004, 10:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the response. That's just the answer I was looking for. I was planning on keeping both weapons if I bought the Velium one. I was gonna put the 75 lifetap aug on it just for when I'm farming or messing around or mainly when I'm just doing dps. I was thinking about maybe putting an anger aug. on the copper hammer. I thought maybe between the anger aug and the proc. it would make for some nasty agro. I would switch both out depending on what I'm doing. I also use a Splitblade with the anger 3 aug. in it which never leaves my hand. lol  <br />
<br />
 Thanks again for response.</div></div><hr />

<br />
this remind me a post ... which one ... ah yes the one that asks why every new member starts with &quot;fisrt post&quot; as an introduction.<br />
<br />
Hey Vikken, sHORTY should remove the &quot;first post&quot; from the New_Member_Hotkey :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Nevertheless it was a folow up from onother thread. So to respond to your post Tkyle we can sum up in :<br />
1. Gemmed Velium Blade is better DPS than the CHoS<br />
2. The CHoS is far more aggro builder than the GVB<br />
<br />
so if you plan to MT choos the best aggro you can find because it helps the wall group. if you just want a DPS setup to help a bit when you don't MT and that you don't want to steal aggro then choose the best DPS with the lower aggro.<br />
<br />
so aggro it would be best to throw (when it will be possible) the anger 3 from the SBoD on a weapon that already have a nice proc. and for the DPS setup go with the GVB auged liftap as you said with the SBoD auged witha DD or another liftap. It would be an optimisation of both setup you want to have or already have.<br />

PS : watch out for the &quot;SBoD is trash shit !!! sell it back to a stupid noob&quot; hotkey fron Haass.</div></div><hr />
