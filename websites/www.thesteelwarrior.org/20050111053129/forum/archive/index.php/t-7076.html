Who thinks this is fake entirely? And who thinks this is a moron, making so many claims, such as:<br />
<br />
Gloves of Airy Mists<br />
Amazing gloves from phase IV in the plane of time, never turn off attack during enrage again with the amazing ability of STRIKETHROUGH.<br />
<br />
<br />
Face Slot: Faceguard of Frenzy<br />
AC: 100<br />
Slot 1, type 8: AUGMENTED additional 40AC from GOD Expansion <br />
<br />
<br />
Neck Slot: Collar of Catastrophe<br />
Shielding is one of the most uber abilities that any item can have for a warrior in the end game you’ll love this as you MA for your entire guild. Only gotten from the Plane of Time phase IV. <br />
<br />
<br />
You will be the MA in 98% of all guilds in the game and in the top five of even the the most uber guilds.<br />
<br />
<br />
And who thinks this is all of the above?<br />
<br />
What combination of these do you think fits for this person?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Helm : Raex’s Helm of Destruction<br />
Slot 1, type 7: Solid Coal of Prowess ADDITIONAL 40 hp!! <br />
...<br />
Raex's Greaves of Destruction<br />
The character needs only 2 hard or 4 easy Ruj Ldon adventures to open up the 40 hp augs available for this slot. <br />
<br />
i would like to know how he can buy an augment for his helm, when he needs some advs to unlock the SAME augment for his legs..</div></div><hr />

How much would you pay for it now?!  But wait, there's more!

But theres enough detail to convince me its a real fairly high end War... Its just not 'perfect' in any way. If I finished my Sturd I'd have the same hp and more AC than he admits to, so despite some of the good gear mentioned, obviously theres some less than perfect stuff in the other slots not being admitted to.<br />
<br />
But some things just don't fit. I can understand misplacing the phases on drops, sure. But 40 AC GoD augment? No chance. 10% Strikethrough = no more damage on enrage? Now thats serious crack smoking there.</div></div><hr />

The equipment/AA/Skills listed are pretty much an identical match.<br />
<br />
Server: Morell-Thule <br />
Guild: Fury's Edge<br />

Maybe this isn't the same person, maybe it is. It's no secret people are fed up and leaving EQ in mass numbers, I'm not surprised to see more like this.</div></div><hr />

Comes down to the old saying &quot;some peoples got more money than they know what to do with&quot;. If they got the cash to throw away for some intangible bits of programming more power to them though.<br />
<br />
Other than my monthly fees, and the expansions since i bought EQ Gold. I got a total of 50 bucks in this game. Thats damn plenty for a game.<br />
<br />
If i were to someday sell my account i'd have to ask probably 300 to 500 bucks. Thats gods plenty for the Gold edition i started out with plus the expansions since then.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh i completely understand that, say Bill Gates wanted to play EQ but didnt want to spend the time to level up a toon. Hell, 1500 bucks to him would be like most of us droping a penny under the pop machine and not worrying to fish it out....</div></div><hr />

Whats sad is the idiots that purchase these accounts, know jack shit about the game and go oocing &quot; 65 blah blah lfg in the plane of power _xxxxxxx_ hp unbuffed, _xxxxx_ mana unbuffed, 1203aa's &quot; then they come to your group and use greater heal, revive or dont know what taunt is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And the best legit AC aug in the game is a 35 AC aug, maybe 1 exists gamewide, from the Time level Guk LDoN raid. There are several 30 AC augs, such as one from the Valdoon time level LDoN raid from MM, and the Blessed Shard from the Primal Insect. But there are no 40 AC's discovered as yet. Its a blatant lie.</div></div><hr />

<br />
thing about player auctions is that once someone makes a bid you can no longer edit your post.<br />
<br />
the helm has a 50 endurance aug on it, not ac..i muffed that one and explained that to countless bidders in emails.<br />
<br />
the momo that said he wouldn't MA for over 98% of the guilds in EQ listed what 6 that he wouldn't MA for right?  Someone help him out with the math on the total number of guilds in EQ and the 5 or so he listed.<br />
<br />
Anyways, the reserve was set for 1k, I just got lucky, everything went great and I have new golf clubs..<br />
<br />
I was very proud of teh toon i created in EQ, i'm happy to see that he will carry on.<br />
<br />
later days-<br />
