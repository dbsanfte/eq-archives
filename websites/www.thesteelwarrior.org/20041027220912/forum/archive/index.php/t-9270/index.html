That's me. I'm broke - I lost the warrior for a while but just got him back. I'm in a family-type guild that is small. I can 2-box a 65 shammy or cleric although I don't like it much. Think 1 groupable encounters. We have no teir 3+ flags. I'm just looking for a little inspiration if any of you have it in you to comment. Pickup raids are almost nonexistent on TT and leaving my guild for a more active one is not really an option. I just want to have a fighting chance against some of the new zones. Thanks for you time. <br />

CT has some stuff you could use too but is slightly harder to get. <br />

Any money you do raise you should probably save for player crafted rings and earrings for now.<br />

Also work in some LDoN time for anger augments and Tak armor.</div></div><hr />
