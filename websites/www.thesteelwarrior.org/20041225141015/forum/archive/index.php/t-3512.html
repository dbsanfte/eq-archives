<br />
Strikethrough ( allows you to hit through defense )<br />
<br />
Avoidance ( miss )<br />
<br />
 Now as to what factor any of these work with, who knows.  If you have Strikethrough +10, what does it mean?<br />
<br />
 Getting to my point.  There is one called Accuracy. What exactly does this do?  We know there is one called combat effects, and that is additive to all combat skills.. but what is accuracy? Anyone care to shed some light?<br />
<br />
 Thanks!</div></div><hr />
