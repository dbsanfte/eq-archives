I know this will make a HUGE difference on my armor choices, so I need to know what I should get that both can wear in case I change my mind....and if I'm doing this in vain, please tell me.<br />
<br />
BTW I am set on these....please don't try changing my mind.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lizards=lots more AC naturally<br />
Asslings=above average stats upon inception+racial abilities<br />
<br />
once you're 60 though they're all the same...go with what you'll have fun with. The Newb stuff you can get is the same junk basically; different name. Both can wear Ry'Gorr and Sebilite chain stuff; and you may have a few different choices available or specialized to each ( small only gear for the assling; and the Lizards' Quest Armour ( i forgot the name; Cabilis Scale? ) plus their PoH is better IMO than the indicolite plate classes can wear.</div></div><hr />

1. The natural AC bonus more than makes up for any difficulty we may have finding plate armor at lower levels, which isn't really a problem anyway due to our Trooper Scale quest armor.<br />
2. We have natural regeneration which does help at lower levels.<br />
3. You won't see many lizzy-warriors so you'll be pretty unique.<br />
4. We look much more badass than hobbits!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd say haffer b/c of the lack of xp penalty, my friend an Iksar monk says the xp penalty sucks all around (he's 65 +tons of AAs).  I have little experience with the iksar xp penalty, my highest was level 14.<br />
<br />
Haffers can also worship RZ, which is enough of a bonus as is.</div></div><hr />
