<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Detheb Ultimaweapon</div><div class="date">02-09-2005, 11:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have 2-3 questions on Xxeric~<br />
<br />
1.) 2 times we engaged out of 4(Our first night into Tacvi) she pushed the tank to far up the axis, warped, and summoned. Is this a bug, does it happen to anyone else? Would like to know if it is happening to other people  :o <br />
<br />
2.) How much dps does she put out when not in defensive? She seems about King/Queen dps. Anyone have any parses?<br />
<br />
3.) Is it true she is one of the hardest mobs to start with(Been told she is harder than about 4 of the other named in the zone)..<br />
<br />
4 attempts resulted in this.<br />
<br />
1- 10% after mend<br />
2- 8% after mend<br />
3- 10% before mend<br />
4- 11% before mend<br />
<br />
4) Think it was good for a first run?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">02-09-2005, 12:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Her powered up DPS is like 1k-5k range.  However she flurries, and she has the procs all goats have (Trample) which adds a lot of spike DPS.  I'd say she's the 2nd highest straight melee DPS mob in Tacvi.  The other encounters have other source of damage that isn't just melee.  However although Xxeric is tough she lacks HPs which means even if you screw up you can still burn her down, whereas you'd have no chance of doing that on say the balance Zun just because he has a lot more HPs.<br />
<br />
We have used a lot of corners in her room and never had any warping issues.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Injektilo</div><div class="date">02-09-2005, 03:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Never warped for us, and yes Xxerric is harder than a few of the other mobs.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rokkar</div><div class="date">02-10-2005, 05:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">never warped on us either</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Detheb Ultimaweapon</div><div class="date">02-10-2005, 09:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Do you guys use lev when fighting her? M yonly guess is that dps pushe her under tank and she pushes him up the wall(Kinda like Groundpounders in RCoD), but without the super huge knockback, just normal push.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Injektilo</div><div class="date">02-10-2005, 12:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why would you use lev fighting her?<br />
<br />
No we dont do that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aonodorus</div><div class="date">02-10-2005, 01:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">you could not use lev in tacvi until recently.<br />
<br />
if your tank is near a door, or on a door, it is possible for the ae to push him through the door, we had that happen a few times back in like, august.  doors are screwy with the knockback type spells in tacvi.  we had a druid get knocked through a door on kretv last night and ended up having to kill a mastruq destroyer in the middle of the kretv fight.  that was fun.</div></div><hr />

I'm surprised how long you've been on Tunare and still don't know how it works.  The little wheel that the hamster runs around in has a crossbar missing, and about every 500 turns, the hamster's concentration breaks and his leg drops through that hole, tripping him and causing the wheel to shake, power to flucuate and all of Tunare to go wonky for a second or two.  Just start counting to 500 the next time it happens, and keep that count running. Every time you hit 500, make sure you aren't near a wall, door, any mob, or the ground (for good measure) and you wont have any warping issues.  :p</div></div><hr />

lol.<br />

Oh, and I don't know why we use lev actually. Officers just make sure its MGB before we engage. hmm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tohkin</div><div class="date">02-11-2005, 02:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Our guild does that too fucking MGB DMF all the time. I hate lev unless I need the resists cuz when I float up I find the mobs much harder to see and tank. Not to mention the lag it USED to cause me... nothing noticeable now since I upgrded my system tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kilzalot</div><div class="date">02-11-2005, 08:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">h8 levi with a passion.  Never use it unless I HAVE to.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Off the subject a tad, anyone  else kill people on the mob that charms Priest ???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">02-11-2005, 11:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We used to try, but although people can always drop an unintended charmed people in 3 seconds flat, when you tell people to actually make an effort to kill a charmed guy, they're not so good at it and the ghosts take a lot less damage (or even heal) if you kill them slowly, so after a while we just gave up that route.</div></div><hr />
