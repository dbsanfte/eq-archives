<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>tongpo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Where in WW do these guys spawn? I'm rounding up guildies to get this killer upgrade since Iksar Warr cannot wear IGS. Please help.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kuvil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you go outside the tunnel from SG and then head diagonally off to the left you should see an undead dragon (I believe).  There are two big rocks, one in front of him, and one behind him.  Two mobs spawn on each rock and you have to kill these four guys.  <br />
<br />
You don't have a magelo or say anything about your lvl, but I have done this several times with friends and it is easily single groupable or less.<br />
<br />
Good luck :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>tongpo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks a ton man. Im bring a few folks 60+<br />
Shaman, cleric and tank =)<br />
<br />
Wish me luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Scaleclad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Trooper, I commend you on finding this resouce to our confined plate options.  Quick battle analysis (as per my report to War Baron Eaton)<br />
<br />
Loc: out and to the left of the SG entrance to WW.  Two groups of two at two dead dragon lanscape items.<br />
Lvl: 56<br />
Class: pal and clr at one, wiz and bl at other<br />
Requirement: clr to heal / pacify, shm to slow buff and dps, you to tank. (you can drop the shm if you and cleric have the hp/mana to just heal through it)<br />
Lvl requirement:  I have done this several times with a 60 war (me) and 65shm where I take one his dog takes the other and we just meet in the middle.  I have also done this with a 4 man group of 55-58.  Both senarios were no contest.<br />
mercs hit in the low 100's barb bl, eru wiz, dorf cler, hum pal.<br />
<br />
The hardest part is finding hte barbarian to turn the heads in to in SS.  Requires Ally, and he is up the stairs at the end of the same hallway as the bank (if I remember right)<br />
<br />
Any other questions I live to serve.  For the Empire.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Vathoss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Anyone know the respawn time of the mercs? It seems anytime I run out there with my drid to check, they arn't  up. =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lillyann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The quest is real easy, I've done it two times so far and both times tanked the mercenaries at level 55. You only need one group of level 50-55 to do it.<br />
<br />
They have a fair amount of HP but are really sissies damage wise. Defensive is not needed at all, and you could even do without any resists.. though I didnt take the risks I hate shammy slows so I switched in some MR gear.<br />
<br />
We had a level 61 Bard both times doing single pulls and playing resist songs and it was cake. Other melees were below 55, as was the cleric.<br />
<br />
Basically you have two and two, you need to split the first two (dwarf cleric and pally) and then the next two (erudite wiz and barb shammy).<br />
<br />
If you have no means of stunning the first two (healers), you MAY be in a little bit of trouble due to their amount of HP but otherwise it sohuld be a walk in the park.<br />
<br />
PS: I couldn't say what is the respawn time, but on TT they are always there as nobody wanst em lol, and sadly, my Kromzek Captain is not up when I need him :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Khazzuz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">did this quest just recently with me (52 warrior at the time) a 49 druid, 51 necro and a 53 necro.  easy as cake, just had the necro's snare and kite them around as i beat the crap out of them from behind.  couldn't have been easier and the risk vs. reward for this quest is phenomenal.  only mob that was any real trouble was the wizzy, be careful of him, had one of the necros die against him.  all of them conned at 55, should be able to single pull them all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">respwn times on these guys is 4 hours. they are practically always up on my server, so no reason if you dont have equivalent items and if SS faction is good to not have the shoulders.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>renasu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I also recently aquired these heads (and now perform a puppet show with them), but I've never been to SS and even after looking at a couple maps I'm pretty lost on where to find the barbarian.<br />
<br />
Could someone try to give basic instructions from the entrance or point me to a site that explains how to get to such places as the bank, maze, and tower?  Also, I have some unadorned guantlets to turn in to the armor quester.  Lastly, I wouldn't mind exploring around SS myself, but are there dangerous areas even if you have ally faction?<br />
<br />
p.s.  To get the heads, I would suggest that you help with the giant fight for the BoB quest, then ask to do the hunters after.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Lillyann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Enter from Wakening Lands,<br />
turn left after the gate,<br />
then keep right to the stairs,<br />
right right right and first door on left there is Torm Wenrar to hand in the smelly heads.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Did them easily with 62dru, 59nec, 58war, 55dru, 52rng, 50dru.<br />
<br />
62dru used Harmony of Nature and single-pulled them to SG zoneline.<br />
<br />
Julius Oresko (Human Warrior) has about 12500 hp.<br />
Rontar O'Karn (Barbarian Beastlord) has a little more than 10000 hp.<br />
Rontar O'Karn's pet has about 500 hp.<br />
Grenth Drakebane (Dwarf Cleric) has a little less than 10000 hp.<br />
Sadeem Oujva (Erudite Wizard) has about 4000 hp.</div></div><hr />
