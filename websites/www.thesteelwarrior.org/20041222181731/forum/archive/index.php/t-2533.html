<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bunnie Burner</div><div class="date">08-13-2003, 10:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Right...<br />
so a change in disciplines wasn't only in the Top 5 of Raaj's poll...<br />
but SOE has also said theyre looking into it...<br />
<br />
so this is our chance I imagine... with SOE officially saying such a thing, we can put some pressure :p.<br />
<br />
Every non-melee got TONS from the PoP expansion, <br />
I was personally hoping for a new batch of Disciplines... which we never got.<br />
<br />
<br />
So let's spring out ideas on:<br />
-new discs<br />
-how to tweak old discs<br />
-how to change the disc system, so melees can use it to do more dps and be more efficient, without being horribly handicapped right after.<br />
<br />
And since theyre &quot;looking into&quot; this, there's a poor chance theyde accept anything else to look into.<br />
So personally, I really think discs are the only way to go now.<br />
<br />
But even if you dont agree that discs is the only way, it shouldnt stop you from posting ideas ;).<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
changing the overall system of discs<br />
I'd imagine that just removing the linked timer should be enough.<br />
Once a disc is done, you can immediately use any other disc.<br />
The disc that was used still has its timer, but it only affects that disc.<br />
<br />
Such a change wouldnt be overpowering either.<br />
We could use multiple offensive discs to get good aggro at the start of a fight in exp groups too, or for simple dps.<br />
But would still be carefull, because you'll be able to use that defensive only once the other discs are done.<br />
<br />
On Raids, the only thing that could even be looked as Possibly overpowering... is the Defensive/Evasive combo....<br />
but that doesnt really change much imo... other then making a Warrior what it should be... a very efficient tank.<br />
<br />
And on a mob that needs tank switching (if there are even any these days), it would mean the mob hurts enough to make evasive unsure and unstable.........and the MT could die any moment --&gt; not changing the tank switching much.<br />
----------------------------------<br />
<br />
Change old discs<br />
<br />
Resist disc definately needs a fix :p,<br />
I'd say make it a + 100 to all resists during 6minutes.<br />
You can't use any other disc during that time... so the benefit better be good.<br />
And making it longer then 6mins wouldnt only be useless(most fights only last 5mins anyhow)... but dangerous too... not being able to use another disc for over 6mins isnt something id want.<br />
<br />
Reuse of the disc - 30mins.<br />
--<br />
<br />
Fellstrike disc. Imo, it's duration is a bit short, and its reuse time is wwaaaaaaaay too long.<br />
Make it a 15 second duration. and Reuse of 30mins.<br />
--<br />
<br />
Mightystrike too long reuse time. Make it 20mins reuse. Possibly make it last longer too.. 20 seconds. gogo crit spam! :D<br />
--<br />
<br />
Charge wtf does this do anyhow?.... lands every hit?..<br />
how about lasts 1minute, reuse 20minutes?<br />
--<br />
<br />
Precise ok... I guess this is like Charge.. only less efficient and lasts longer?<br />
how about make it last 3minutes, reuse 20minutes?<br />
--<br />
<br />
Fearless... we got the aa now :p... but I guess its ok the way it is... if Timer gets unlinked.<br />
<br />
Fortitude May be of more use now that timer is unlinked.<br />
Maybe bring reuse down to 45mins.<br />
<br />
Riposte duration is good atm... reuse should be shorter... like 45mins.<br />
---------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
New Discs!!<br />
<br />
Fun Part!!!<br />
from 50 to 60 we get discs.... but from 61 to 65... higher levels... where we should gain more power...<br />
we get nothing...<br />
<br />
So... what cool new disc could we get from 61 to 65?<br />
or even at lower levels to help em lower level warrs.... like a small cute one at level 10 ;p.. or something.<br />
<br />
Aura of the Berzerker --&gt; /disc Berzerker.<br />
Every group member gets a 20% haste going over cap during 3minutes.<br />
Reuse 20 minutes.<br />
level 62 disc.<br />
<br />
<br />
Image of the Fearfull --&gt; /disc fearfull<br />
Your body emanates a fearfull image... making your oponent hesitate about hitting you.<br />
Yaya... I already mentioned this idea elsewhere... but works as a disc as well!<br />
Every time a mob touches you, his next hit is delayed by 20%.<br />
So if he manages to land a quad on you... his next hit will be delayed by 80%!<br />
Although that would rarely happen, especially with the avoidance aas at this level ;).<br />
This disc will NOT affect mobs immune to slow.<br />
This disc will NOT affect a slowed mob.<br />
Duration 1 minute, reuse time 1minute. (allows you to keep it on yourself permanently, at the cost of other damage discs not being used. Thus making warriors a good choice for groups with no slower.... but keep a slower as a very good advantage.)<br />
You get this disc at level 63.<br />
<br />
<br />
Aura of Flames<br />
Your body diffuses intense heat.<br />
You gain a Damage Shield equal to your Fire Resist divided by 10.<br />
So with full FR, you can get a 50DS with this disc.<br />
Around 20 for decently geared warriors.<br />
Disc duration 3minutes, reuse 10minutes.<br />
get this disc at level 61.<br />
------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
There we go, dont have any ideas for level 64 and 65 yet...<br />
<br />
<br />
I dont believe any of these to be very imbalancing,<br />
but they are procuring a very nice fix.<br />
<br />
Making us a good choice for certain groups,<br />
ups our dps appropriately.<br />
<br />
Also gives us more exciting things to do during exp....<br />
gotta make sure your disc isnt down.... and make a choice of next disc.<br />
Or.... you may want to not use any disc... just incase you need Fortitude for an emergency!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thaak</div><div class="date">08-13-2003, 10:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like the Bezerker and Aura of Flames ideas.<br />
<br />
The Image of the Fearful seems a little... far-fetched.<br />
<br />
I'll have better thoughts in the morning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bunnie Burner</div><div class="date">08-14-2003, 08:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just think of Image of the Fearfull as a small &quot;stun&quot; after each hit.<br />
Except it's not really a stun, just a delay ;p.<br />
Although making it a stun could facilitate the thing...<br />
<br />
a small 0.5 second stun, with no hate. = artifical Slow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">08-14-2003, 09:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think delinking all the disaplines would be bad. That would mean 1 tank could be defensive/evasive 6 minutes of 7.5. Splitting disaplins offensive/defensive however is a must for warriros. I just never use offensive disaplines as defensive is just potentially too useful. (Handy when doing Kriegers with druid or shaman healing at least, or you get that surprise LOM call.)<br />
<br />
Stunning blows-- 30 to 60 seconds (depending on balance issues) where ever blow acts as if it were a slam for stun checks. Medium reuse time (about the same as defensive). Give us a chance to do somethign useful on gating mobs.<br />
<br />
I woudl rather that the new stuff be skill based as opposed to us channeling magic suddenly after 65 levels. And I rather have new abilities rather than ones that can be done with items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kilaara</div><div class="date">08-14-2003, 10:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">To kill 2 cats with one shot.<br />
<br />
Discipline MightyBlow ( update to mightystrike)<br />
<br />
8 Seconds at 63 each hit a crippling blow<br />
Reusetime 2 min 30 seconds in 63 <br />
<br />
going to 10 seconds in 64 and 2 min 15 seconds reuse<br />
<br />
and finally 12 seconds in 65 and 2 Minutes reuse.<br />
<br />
That would give a nice Boost at start also for aggro.<br />
<br />
All offensive disciplines on one timer. All defensive disciplines on a second one. But not two disciplines together.<br />
<br />
Discipline Aggroprecision ( combination of aggressive and precision both effects in one with the drawback of a real high damagepenalty 50 % more damage taken ) (65 )<br />
Duration 3 Minutes<br />
Reuse 20 Minutes</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bunnie Burner</div><div class="date">08-14-2003, 11:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That would mean 1 tank could be defensive/evasive 6 minutes of 7.5 <br />
<br />
And how is that bad? please explain further :)<br />
<br />
Atm, we almost always have one MT on a mob anyhow.... <br />
what will it change if between discs, its only 1.5minute discless?... <br />
<br />
Sure, it will make us a bit more powerfull as a tank..... but isn't that what we want?<br />
And I doubt it would affect much any high end encounter.<br />
Other then reduce the luck factor on Xegony fights ;)<br />
<br />
grouping offensive and defensive could work too... but all the Reuse timers would have to be very low.<br />
<br />
After using Fellstrike to gain a bit of aggro on a mob on inc.... i dont want to wait 30mins to be able to get aggro on inc again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeka</div><div class="date">08-14-2003, 12:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The linking of /disc timers together was a cost.  Use one skill now costs not using another immediately.  The question becomes, is the cost too high?  Wouldn't just the fact you can't use the /disc you just used again during cooldown a cost?<br />
<br />
I view /discs as a failed attempt to add flexibility to Melee.  I'm not sure if it should be scrapped in favor of something new but the way /discs stand they are unwieldy and for the most part unusable.<br />
<br />
I always thought Warriors should be the only class that can be Offensive and Defensive at the same time.  To this day I still do not see the point of crippling offensive DPS when doing defensive (they should have done a movement modifier if they thought defensive was too powerful).  I still wonder about the lengths of the reset time.  SOE controls the game...why can't they tune monsters to take into account faster reset times on skills?<br />
<br />
The point is no matter how fun or cool a skill is, if its too hard to use its unused.    What is the justification for having a /disc with short duration?  What is the justification for having a /disc with a long reset time?  If a /disc has either restriction then that means they are powerful?  By most accounts, /discs with short durations, long reset times, aren't that powerful compared to things Casters field.<br />
<br />
So I say if you are playing with the idea of revamping all of the /discs throw every preconceived notion out the window and start fresh.  Make Fellstrike (just grabbing one at random) solid from the start and make the costs reasonable to be used instead of saved.  Warriors should be actively looking to use a lot of their /discs during raids and exp groups instead of holding them back for the rainy day that might never come.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gyrfalcon</div><div class="date">08-14-2003, 02:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Eureka! What is the one thing pure melee don't have that every other class has? You guessed it, SPELLS! Why not model disciplines on the spell model, give us the space usually reserved for spell gems, put in a new &quot;spell&quot; vender in PoK who sells sheets outlining melee disciplines, and melee then take the sheets and study them (ie, put into their discipline book, which just happens to look like a spell book by the way) and can then commit their discipline to memory. Memorized disciplines would be represented by (surprise) Discipline Gems. By clicking on a discipline gem, that discipline is activated,and all other disciplines are greyed out. When an objective reactivation timer is reached, the discipline gems become active again and ready for reuse. Just a thought, maybe providing an easier way to organize disciplines in game, as well as a method of introducing new disciplines without having to change the entire dynamics of the game (the same way they introduce new spells), and we can use graphics already available in game. Hell, I could see a whole new avenue of quests to get new discipline styles not available from venders. If the developers really got froggy, they would untie all the disciplines from the same timer and give each one individual timers, just that when a discipline is active, all other disciplines are greyed out. By the way, this discipline model would only be available to pure melee, hybrid melee would have to rely on the old model for their disciplines (the benefit of not having a spell book).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thaak</div><div class="date">08-14-2003, 02:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gyrfalcon, that makes us sound like bards.<br />
<br />
They don't have a spell book, they have a song book!<br />
<br />
They don't cast spells, they play songs!<br />
<br />
While I like the idea of it, the fundamentals of being a melee are that you don't get anything to &quot;cast&quot;.<br />
<br />
But the idea of doing quests for new disciplines sounds like a damn good idea. Shit, casters got new spellls to quest for. Why can't melee quest for disciplines?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gyrfalcon</div><div class="date">08-14-2003, 03:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thaak, we wouldn't &quot;cast&quot; disciplines, but rather activate them (kinda like an instant cast spell) with no chance of failure, and unlike bards, we don't have to keep hitting the buttons over and over again, but rather know the appropriate time to activate which discipline to get its maximum effect. Also unlike bards and casters, our disciplines only affect us, so the only message that other group members would see would be the same message they see now. Hell, make /shield a warrior only discipline that they get at the appropriate level. It's not a discipline right now, but it acts like one. I think the developers took the chicken guano way out when they added disciplines by making us reliant on the slash entry and hot button system to activate our disciplines. It's about time they spent more than twenty minutes developing something for us melee, and then waiting over a year to even talk about fixing what they did in the first place.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Reduction on the timers for current discs would be a grand idea, but getting rid of them would be bad. I know I would chain fortitude =) when MTing. And if I wasn't... chain furious or furious/mighty/furious/mighty  muahaha<br />
<br />
Discs need work though, that is for sure, and omg, thanks so much for /shield....................</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaldanm</div><div class="date">08-22-2003, 02:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I could see those 2 :<br />
<br />
discipline 64 : Persistance<br />
This discipline last 12 seconds. during this discipline, the warrior can't die. However, if at the end of the discipline he don't have enought hp he will die :p (reuse time 30 mins)<br />
<br />
Discipline 65 : State of the Overlord<br />
this discipline last 3 minutes, and combine the effect of precise and defensive (without the malus), while the warrior is hasted 15% (stack with all hastes, over the enchanter/bard cap) and always in berserker fury (crippling hits instead of criticals). at the end of the disc the warrior is slowed 15% for 3 mins (reuse time 1 hour).</div></div><hr />

<br />
You dont remove them, timers are the only thing keeping disc from being overpowered.<br />
But the way they are linked now, makes disc underpowered, and most of them are pretty much useless due to it.<br />
<br />
You only Unlink them,<br />
using a disc won't stop you from using another disc,<br />
but you'll still have to wait before reusing that same disc.<br />
<br />
In other words, you cant chain furious.... nor can you chain furious/mighty....<br />
both discs last a couple seconds, whereas it takes over 30mins to reuse them.<br />
<br />
So once you used up furious and mighty... what are you left with?...<br />
Choose carefully.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hulanta</div><div class="date">08-22-2003, 02:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fortitude May be of more use now that timer is unlinked.<br />

 <br />
  <br />
<br />
FORTITUDE is no longer linked?  I can hit fortitude for 9 seconds on Reparm and then go Defensive or Evasive?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeka</div><div class="date">08-22-2003, 05:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is a fun discussion about unlinking disciplines over on PON.  There are some persausive arguements that it allows a Warrior to some serious &quot;burst&quot; damage with some combinations only as long as they are not tanking (or plan to in the near future).  It isn't perfect (like Furious and Fortitude) but in general it seems to conceptually work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bunnie Burner</div><div class="date">08-23-2003, 04:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fortitude and Furious last too shortly to be used effectively anyhow.<br />
They would be kept for emergency use when tanking,<br />
and would be useless otherwise.<br />
<br />
And theres always the possiblity of making reuse times LONGER on certain discs to avoid overpower... but i doubt that would even be needed.</div></div><hr />
