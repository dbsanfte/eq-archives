<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My aggro setup for a while has been:<br />
Scimitar of Ykesha (main)<br />
dmg8<br />
dly 22<br />
proc ykesha  (stats not great, sick aggro on proc)<br />
<br />
and<br />
Venomous Axe of the Velium Brood (offhand)<br />
dmg11<br />
dly24<br />
ac5<br />
proc venomous chill<br />
<br />
Recently I got a Spiked Velium Mallet on a 8th shawl raid<br />
dmg10<br />
dly20<br />
proc frostcall<br />
Don't remember all stats but it's basically a 1hb version of a snowchipper.<br />
Was wondering if the frostcall proc is good for aggro at all or if it's basically  just DPS.  Also needing some advice on which weapons to use in which hands when I'm MT, and which to use when I don't necessarily want aggro, but may have to get it in emergency (offtanking adds/MT falls and I take over kind of stuff).  Any advice on which of these 3 to use when would be appreciated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wirmy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, I'm not much of an expert, but I've currently got 2 Honed Blades of the Ykesha, 12/22, and procs Ykesha of course.  It would be a little upgrade.  I don't know how much the go for, their crafted and all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaago</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'd say keep the scimitar in your primary and use the mallet in your offhand all the time.  You won't get much agro from the proc, but with decent dex it goes off quite a bit.  My monk uses one in his primary and I need a lucky streak to take agro from the tank if I let him build a bit of agro before I jump in.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Friedrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Personally I would use mallet mainhand and scimitar offhand for any situation and adjust accordingly.  The Ykesha proc &quot;should&quot; aggro more than frostcall proc but the mallet will far outdamage the scimitar so its may aggro better from a DPS standpoint.  If you find aggro difficult, switch them around.  <br />
<br />
I would work towards a Frostbringer and pair it with the mallet long term.  Should be good aggro and decent DPS.  If you aren't tanking, I would pick up a 2 hander that is close to 1:1 ratio for DPS.<br />
<br />
It is difficult to tell without more info like what level you are, what you are fighting, etc.  Keep in mind that I usually hunt with friends for exp and we rarely have the ideal group so my damage does count and I hate gimping my damage output badly just to hold aggro.  I realize though that sometimes it is necessary.<br />
<br />
Atm, we are farming UP with a 59 cleric, 63 druid, 63 warrior, and filling in the group with our friends who are lvl 45.  We all get exp (although no where near PoP) and we are outfitting them with gear.  In this scenario, the druid and myself are doing the majority of the damage.</div></div><hr />
