<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rikam</div><div class="date">11-24-2004, 10:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was just wondering how you would rate the Blade of Ornate Symbols (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=26143). Guild is gonna kill him soon was wondering if it was worth my time. With it being 23/26 its slow but if I MH it and Offhand BoC would that be better then my current BoC/OSoW combo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vilicontus</div><div class="date">11-24-2004, 10:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My OSoW is bagged, I have a stun proc weapon in offhand now. Whether you want to main-hand the Blade, is just a question of maximum aggro vs dps. BoC mainhand = more swings and better aggro proc firing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dags</div><div class="date">11-24-2004, 10:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I used the Blade of Ornate Symbols until I completed epic 1.5.  I had a BoC/Osow combo both with anger 3.  I noticed an improvement when I changed the Osow out for the Blade of Ornate Symbols.  It wasnt a big jump in agro but it was noticable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">11-25-2004, 04:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I rate it much lower : between CHoS and SotB in mainhand because it's too slow for a ratio under 1.<br />
however in offhand it's much stronger : between Chaotic Black scimetar and Demerix.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daze</div><div class="date">11-25-2004, 04:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's a good weapon , the only thing is being aware of the knockback , it has a pronounced knockback and stuns up to level 55 , if you can handle the weaponsmith , you can probably handle velitorkin and he drops a much better toy with a stun up to level 70 and 19/19 stats Velitorkin's femur <br />
<br />
<br />
but if you want to play pallies at their own game , then it's the dogs bolx <br />
the knockback is great fun ,</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rikam</div><div class="date">11-25-2004, 05:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Alright cool thanks for input. Trying to get some upgrade to OSoW and guild just killed fennin so working on ele more then oow/god is the prob.  Guess I would just be as well burn dkp getting ele quest gear and save for DBoTWL or one of those time/god types.</div></div><hr />
