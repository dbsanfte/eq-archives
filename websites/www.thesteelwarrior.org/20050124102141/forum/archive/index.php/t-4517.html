<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">11-21-2003, 05:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Once you had said you will pass good ideas on if asked to(and im asking, you have more sway than i do)<br />
<br />
Can you talk to the art departments and the devs about the &quot;Tunare graphic engine&quot; soon, so they dont get to far ahead to be able to put this in to effect.<br />
<br />
what im thinking is that with the new MA code on test you could have it so the mob responds to combat moves(i say the MA code because it wouldnt look pretty to have a mob over acting from 6 people smacking it) <br />
<br />
kinda like the MA parry's the monsters strike; id kinda like to see his striking arm swing wide from the deflection, or if i reposite, id like to see me sneak a hit in past his strike, just thought it would be nice to have &quot;spell effects&quot; for melees in that regard<br />
<br />
Also, since this engine is made to replace(not add on) to the exisiting graphic engine, is it with the expantion only or is it free so the server isnt sending out 2 differnt visuals.<br />
<br />
P.S. i know alot of warrior are turning the shit wheels about the new combat system, but you and the devs should not take it personal because we have not even seen the new system, furthermore, most of us decided to hold off on the stand down because we wanted to give you a chance to make good on the promises, and we are willing to try something new, so dont get to mad at the flammers on not visit us anymore(and by flammers i mean the people trashing the system with out even playing with it yet) &gt;D</div></div><hr />

Classic postscript :p<br />

<br />
ok i admit i sneak attacked with my post script</div></div><hr />

<br />
Never mind Gerick, just never mind...<br />
<br />
:p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">11-21-2003, 06:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well maybe you dont understand why i said that last bit its simple<br />
<br />
all the preemptive bitching might just make them say fuck it, and trash something they spent 10 months making on our dime, meaning we might have to wait another 10 months to have BoC's spawn everytime we log in, now i know that sounds fine to some of you but someday a BoC isnt gona cut it<br />
<br />
<br />
the main thing is this system is easy to change, its flexable, the more flexable something is the better its chances to survive, and as a part of our class it means we can survive.<br />
<br />
text files have been added from test with names like anger, inrage, improved anger, stuff like that sounds like agro to me, and it coinsides with the new system, chances are its for us, as i dont think a rogue wants agro.<br />
<br />
so basically people need to stop bitching at least untill it is out to the public, then you can complain and hey guess what? because its flexable that means they can change it to make it better if we still are not happy, besides post script is an afterthought and i wanted to say that because this board has gotten negative and ive seen the outhouse mentality leak over in the arena, i dont want to see it leak into the tavern<br />
<br />
heck people are even saying there is a warrior mitigation boost on test, its not what we wanted persay, but if we luck out and get a new combat system that DOES fix our aggro problems, and a mitigation boost we might just rangle a few groups away from the knights</div></div><hr />

<br />
So what you're saying is, this isn't going to go live for another 9 months?<br />
<br />
:P<br />
<br />
&quot;as i dont think a rogue wants agro.&quot;<br />
<br />
A beserker might.<br />
<br />
&quot;so basically people need to stop bitching at least untill it is out to the public, &quot;<br />
<br />
It IS out to the public. They released a statement. They put these things on test. They're having a chat about it. This is all part of the process.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">11-21-2003, 08:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">its not the final public release to all servers, also on test server you cant use any moves yet</div></div><hr />

<br />
Where in the world did you get the idea that we were making something called the Tunare graphic engine?<br />
<br />
Rewrite that in a way that's clearer (don't use any abbreviations, please) and send it to the Dev Corner without any post scripts about other things, and I'll happily pass it along.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

<br />
also Computer Games Magazine had a blurb, so did everquestvault on IGN, quite a few saying they were not allowed to talk much because of those pesky NDA's<br />
<br />
i think this is the new hype tactic, put the new exciting info on things that are out of the way so your friend ends up telling you all about the next expantion and you trust your friends &gt;D j/k<br />
<br />
ill retype it tho and make it more understandable and then submit it, but you gota admit it would be cool to see a parry and not just be reading about it hehe</div></div><hr />

Since you popped up in this thread, I'll ask this question of you just to see what if any response I might get.  So far, the new combat system doesn't seem to address the primary problem warriors have, which is &quot;knights can tank as well as me plus lock aggro&quot;.  At first blush, the proposed melee changes seem to give warriors more utility, and that's about all.  Given that, it almost seems that warriors are expected to give up the raid tank role, and take on a utility and/or dps role.  Again, that's just based on what little has been mentioned so far.  I'm curious if SOE's intention is for a redefining of roles along the lines of the aforementioned, or if warriors are going to be given some form of RELIABLE and ON DEMAND means of aggro generation, which knights currently have.<br />
If the answer is &quot;just wait for the chat&quot; or &quot;just wait till it goes live and try it&quot;, I can accept that.  However, these questions are what is currently on the minds of most warriors.  Just wanted to see what, if any, info you might share with us on these topics.<br />
<br />
Beo<br />
<br />
PS:  I think adding an additional melee class is a mistake given how unbalanced the classes are currently.  Too many classes sharing a given role is one of the biggest problems with balancing right now; a new class would seem to be adding to the problem rather than relieving it.  Maybe that's just me.  I suppose time will tell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anker steadfast</div><div class="date">11-23-2003, 10:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heck, I just hope that the Endurance Regen will be high enough for us to hold aggro with those new special attacks and whatnot.<br />
<br />
Seriously, that's my biggest fear of what can go wrong.</div></div><hr />
