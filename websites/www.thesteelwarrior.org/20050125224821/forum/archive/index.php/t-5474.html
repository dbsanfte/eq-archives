<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">01-31-2004, 03:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i was thinking the otherday about how much luclin graphics improved the game, and the vapor of a tunare 3.0 system, suppost to be faster, less intesive and look better.<br />
<br />
if they do another model update i was hoping that the art department spends more time on mobs, players, and weapons<br />
<br />
ill break it down<br />
<br />
for the mobs, each expantion i notice about 10-20 new mob types, from that they make them differnt color tints and say its around &quot;40 new exciting and challenging mob types&quot; /chuckle<br />
<br />
what im say is rather than just tinting the same damn mob 3 or 4 times(in the case of animal monster, undead monster, summons etc) why not just re-texture then? change a color here, make a gash in the shell or hide there, maybe have some rusty armor on the skeletons, made up of dead adventure's gear of those they have slain.<br />
<br />
as for players, why does everyone's armor look the damn same? i get really sick of it, ornate should look awsome, with gold and silver engravings, so much infact that when you tint the armor it doesnt fug them up, or maybe you can dye the ingravings independantly. elemental armor should have such a graphic that you take notice of it and recognize their acomplessment.<br />
<br />
how about some formal wear? i know a few half elfs who are PO'd they dont have a robe graphic for in game weddings, or formal wear for partys, i know it'd be for shits and giggles, but thats what makes EQ fun for me at least :D<br />
<br />
as for weapons, i want to see the return of the great giant, butt rendering axes, the big bad swords, mystical staffs, incense burners that have realistic smoke.<br />
<br />
reason i bring this up is if they are really changing the graphic engine what would you like to see, kinda like<br />
 <br />
while your at it hehe <br />
<br />
pardon spelling<br />
<br />
personally i think something really cool would be ragdoll physics added to combat :)<br />
<br />
btw they said they have made a system where NPCs can move object, this is ok to say without breaking NDA because its on the live site for everyone to see(there is a grumpy ship worker kicking around boxes to move them on the ship city, they slide and tumble heh!) so keep that in mind, art can have a slight effect on the envorment</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kizef</div><div class="date">01-31-2004, 07:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem with all those really cool graphics is that everyone will have to load every texture and model into video memory. Some people have a bad enough time with some of the older cards. Imagine with 50more megs of Textures and models.<br />
<br />
<br />
I think this has been brought up every time they add a new model or tweak an older one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renix</div><div class="date">01-31-2004, 10:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not sure what the graphic engine revamp is going to be. If its just another patch to allow new effects and texture compression, the update will only effect new zones, so purchasing GoD (and future expansions) would be necessary for the update to be of any use.<br />
<br />
If its a full revamp including new textures (or the same textures re-compressed with the new compression methods), a new and more effecient animation system, we'd have to download all the PC/NPC models and textures again. I'm not sure how the EQ file system works, but if the textures are stored inside the character and zone models, then we'd have to download all the EQ content again.<br />
<br />
I just fail to see how they plan to get this new engine into the game and distribute it. If its a full revamp, then 56kers would probably never be able to download the update. If its just an add-on to the current engine to enable a few things (like luclin was), then nobody will get the update (or it wont take any noticable effect) if you don't buy their future expansions.</div></div><hr />

its not vapor, check the live site for new engine details</div></div><hr />

<br />
No...the problem is that the technical design is outdated and they need to think of a more creative solution than caching everything (nifty for 1999) on the client.<br />
<br />
This would require creativity, money and time.  SoE has these raw materials...mayhap you will see it in EQ2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">02-11-2004, 12:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">flair your wrong, they are testing the EQ2 advanced engine in basic mode(EQ 1) <br />
<br />
the problem is the system was built in the days where mobs where ment to be unkillable, ask the devs players invented raids, now 40 people in a raid wasnt a problem back then, but now when 60 people in a raid is the norm and hundreds at wayfarers camps this shit just doesnt fly (not to mention they put the luclin upgrade on top of a shitty base, you dont build a mantion on a dirt floor) with partical effects, intensive engines(level of detail where the detail changes with range) and moving leaves and grass<br />
<br />
what they want to do is scrap the base, scrap the house and build it from the ground up to be more stable, and run smoother which is ENTIRLY possible but it takes a butt load of work, since they are already doing a engine for EQ2 they have the raw untested code on hand, guess what? we are gona beta test a basic version (like those basic &quot;freeware&quot; programs, expect to be told that EQ2 is all this and more :P cheap shot i know, but i already have GoD and am still getting hourly server messages to buy it)<br />
<br />
even if we are being testers, it will be nice to have my preformance go up without paying 100 for a new computer part</div></div><hr />

<br />
/ponder I think this what I said?  heh<br />
<br />
Graphics engine != the totality of software architecture; the graphics engine is only one component of this.  My arguement is they need to consider a re-architecture of the whole animial (brain surgery) if they want functional extensibility (the pretty customizable graphics).  Me thinks we agree on this...also I imagine SoE has something in their plans fer this as well.<br />
<br />
Also (crazy historian): Luclin did not alter the graphics engine as much as it changed the tools to render 3d space (Umbral libraries).  The misimplementation of this brought us the massive latency we saw in those days.<br />
<br />
/peace</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">02-12-2004, 12:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">bottom line? luclin was pretty but is the all time suck on low end boxes =P<br />
<br />
hope this doesnt fizzle out like most of the melee changes, oh and i ment your wrong about seeing it in eq2, we will see it in eq1, just missing a few features so we have a reason to try eq2</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grendonbb</div><div class="date">02-12-2004, 02:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I jus want em to fix the f*cking weapon animations... I mean come on, if the graphic of your weapon swinging has absolutely no relation to when it ACTUALLY swings, then wtf is the point of a weapon swinging animation in the first place?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">02-12-2004, 05:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hehe ya, i know paladins arnt as good as they claim to be, but even they should know better than to bash something with a windriders lance rather than poke it</div></div><hr />
