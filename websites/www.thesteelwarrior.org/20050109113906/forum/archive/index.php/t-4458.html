They really started on the Kunark kick when Absor dropped in and said &quot;yes, no new combat skills for you.&quot; Of course, some ignored his comment the disciplines are going to be looked at and that any and all should check out Test to help work the bugs out. Really, we all need to honestly give this a chance, find out what all is going on, before turning into this.</div></div><hr />

Your help on the Test server would be appreciated when this appears there for testing. Obviously nobody wants the pendulum to swing too far in any direction.<br />

I am thinking its gonna be really really over balance melee vs. hybrids.  So they are gonna undercompensate and leave warriors with their thumbs up their asses again.</div></div><hr />

All I want to know is how they will be reverted back four expansions to the times when they had penalties up the ass.  Now that the penalties are gone, what is left to make them so obsolete as during Kunark?<br />
<br />
The new toys coming out will add to them as well as us.  I mentioned that they will have their tanking abilities, they will have their spells which add HUGE utility, and they will even get a taste of the new toys.  I then mentioned that people will have to choose when looking for a tank, one with utility and a small amount of new toys or a tank with no utility and a full set of toys.<br />
<br />
Either they don't like first time posters or the other warriors that commented will have their posts removed as soon as an admin finds them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bumraz</div><div class="date">11-20-2003, 11:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You will all no doubt flame away at this, but what can I do?  No one honest begrudges pure melees their much needed boost.  I, for one, truly hope that boost adds to those players' utility and fun in both grinding and raiding situations.<br />
<br />
However, to understand the &quot;Kunark&quot; worries you have to have been in that position at that time.  During that time, knights as a group were wholly eclipsed by pure melees and casters, not really being able to tank even marginally as well, not doing even vaguely acceptable DPS, and not having many group or raid friendly skills or spells.  Most guilds kept minimal knights, just enough to insure that class only loot did not rot.  This period dragged on for a *long* time. Many of us who played through that period are (I think justifiably) nervous about a return to that tertiary position.<br />
<br />
Just as warriors now feel slighted because groups choose the &quot;always superior&quot;  tank (purportedly a knight class), so too in that time did groups and guilds always choose warriors.  The much vaunted utility that gives hybrids so many nice toys, didn't count for much in Kunark, as those of you who actually played during that time will admit, if you're truthful.<br />
<br />
I don't wish for warriors to always be second choice, but neither do I wish to always, in every case, assume a secondary role.  At the end of the day I'd like to see both groups, hybrids and pure melees bring their own unique contribution to the table, so that each could shine at their own time.  Isn't that what makes the game fun?<br />
<br />
I really hope the changes work out for pure melees, so we can all get back to playing the game we all enjoy. The finger pointing and bitching on both sides is extremely tiresome.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hi there. At this point in time pure melees (particularly the one trick ponies known as warriors and monks) are wholly eclipsed by hybrids and casters. Average warriors can't hold aggro, thus can't tank as well as knights. We have ZERO utility to bring to the group. Our raid roles have been eroded by the closing of the HP and AC gaps through fucked up itemization (in SOL and POP).<br />
<br />
Knights don't want Kunark? Well neither do we, and this IS our Kunark. Our discos were ruled as &quot;overpowered&quot; in Kunark and instead of nerfing them then, we've been paying for it ever since.</div></div><hr />

And as soon as they get a whiff of some upgrades that are being done to other classes, they all start in with cries &quot;wheres ours! We should get this tooooo&quot; Just goes to show how god damn spoiled they are</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grimmlokk</div><div class="date">11-20-2003, 01:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I played a paladin during Kunark. Probably more than 99% of these fuckwits using it as a battle cry. Higher end one too. And THEY WERE NOT THAT FUCKING BAD. So god damned sick of people who hit level 53 when Velious came out complaining about how bad they had it in Kunark even though they never experienced most of it when they were at their worst. I did. As a paladin(and a warrior, one who has hardly changed one little fucking bit since Kunark).<br />
<br />
 You are right now what rogues were in Kunark. SHUT YOUR STUPID FUCKING NOISEHOLES YOU MORONS!<br />
<br />
 I really like how paladins and rangers who were all gung-ho for melee changes(haven't checked the SK shithole) are now all offended that we're getting something they're not. Boo fucking hoo. Kinda like when every expansion comes out and you get 20 new, USEFUL, spells and we get....more hitpoints. Which of course you also get.<br />
<br />
 Fuck hybrids. Fuck their sisters and mothers and cats too. I never jumped on the Melee-Are-SOOOO-Underpowered bandwagon. Never will, but holy fuck until these changes were just announced I never hated any specific class so much. Get the fucking sand out of your vaginas. Suck it up, the melee are gonna get something new HOLY FUCK THE SKY IS FALLING! Don't worry, this will get whored out to every other class eventually just like every other unique skill we get.</div></div><hr />

actually I've seen a few paladins &quot;gloat&quot; how this is actually GOOD, since they will give warriors fun toys without fixing aggro, thus keeping the paladin's overpower present..<br />
<br />
Yup.. that's paladins for you.. HAPPY when imbalance is in their favor. (they're not all like that.. thank god.. but there are a lot.)</div></div><hr />

Read my post: I am hoping you get a much needed boost. There was no chicken little &quot;the sky is falling&quot; bullshit, no jealousy, I don't want or need any new abilities, really.  My hope is only that at the end of the day everyone has their slice of the pie, and can feel like they contribute and are valued. I want SOE to get it right.  I am not gloating, taunting or otherwise whining.<br />
<br />
As for the retard who thinks I don't know how knights worked in Kunark: my knight's birth date was in April of 99, and I have well over 300 days played on him.  Currently 65 with over 500aa's.  Yes knights *were* that bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">11-20-2003, 02:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't agree with Grimmlokk on a great many things, but he's dead right about this one.  Knights had some disadvantages in Kunark.  Guess what; they're supposed to have disadvantages.  It's called a tradeoff boys and girls.   Their advantage is that they can tank to some degree and cast spells from their parent class to some degree.  Kinda like the tradeoff that wizards have some of the best burst and sustained DPS in the game, but shatter like a stained glass window if they get hit.  Warriors tank.  It's all we do (the new toys may change that).  Because it's all we do, we WERE best at it.  Knights had some ability to tank, and some to cast.  At that time, the two didnt combine into a viable whole class.  (dont get me wrong, they could solo better than I could, just werent very group/raid friendly) SoE went WAAAAAY overboard bringing them up, and then went equally overboard boosting everyone with a mana bar via expansion after expansion of new spells.   I've got news for all you whiney asses, things were way more balanced in Kunark than they are now.  If I didn't know some paladins personally that are damned fine people, I'd think you were all just a bunch of fucking whiney brats that cant stand the fact that maybe, just maybe, somebody will get something new that you don't get.  I understand that since you are basically 90% warrior and 60% cleric you're used to getting most of the abilities that both your parent classes have without having any downside, but given that from what I can see this may just be eye candy like crits and also, unless they still have a bunch of extremely cool stuff in the works does nothing to fix our ultimate problem, which is that knights tank like we do and have spells(aggro lock +utility),  begrudging the pure melees this new &quot;toy&quot; is just fucking petty.  Some of my friends are paladins and I'll be damned if bullshit like this isnt starting to make me start to feel like paladins should be nerfed so fucking hard they come to refer to Kunark as &quot;The Golden Age of Knighthood&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just make sure the anti-class mobs are very very evenly distributed, and make sure the people know about the preference, from either easily acquired tomes or NPCs in the area, and that could rock!<br />
<br />
Using paladins as the scapegoat here: Undead mobs aplenty, but every so often a special version (easily distinguished) spawns when you kill one of them that is unslowable, hits Paladins for 1.5x as much as they hit other classes, and once the paladin got on the agro list was always in the top slot no matter what.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trilith</div><div class="date">11-22-2003, 02:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is highly agrivating.  I hate to break it to you guys, but you have *just* as many idiots and whiners as paladins do.  So, lets not try to pretend that this is a haven for people who just want balance.  <br />
<br />
I am going to try to explain this shit again.  I hope it sinks in with one of you.  Paladins and Shadowknights probably were balanced during kunark. Guess the fuck what, you guys are pretty balanced now.  You know what problem unites the knights of kunark and the warriors of today?  The perception of the rest of the player base.  If you honestly think back to kunark, while a knight could tank, do you have any idea how many people refused to allow them to?  I remember that awful shit and not even as a knight.  Guess what is happening now?  You people tank fine, you hold agro decently just not to the degree that it makes groups easier.  You do your job fine.  The problem is, the player base does not care you do your job fine, they only see that knight agro is &gt; your agro.  That is *exactly* what kunark was like for knights. <br />
<br />
 The funniest thing about this shit is, none of this has to do with knight agro at all.  Your problem stems from a dramatic change to the way caster damage works.  Not just caster damage, caster limits to be more exact.  When damage/xp was limited by mana and mana regen, warriors were gods.  Now that damage/xp is limited by agro, your shit out of luck.  That is the shit that is hurting you guys so much.  (Naturally, itemization *does* play a role too).  You people should understand the situation Kunark knights were better then everyone, how is it you *still* can't empathize with other classes?  <br />
<br />
And finally, the thing that scares everyone so much about these changes, specifically any involving warriors, is most people abhorred the holy trinity.  Having 1 class that you *have* to pick to tank or heal or do crowd control is horrible game design and hurts everyone else that has to deal with it.  Forget the fact that I play a knight, I play a caster too and I don't *ever* want to go back to that.  Its taken the player base years to break that shit up and we still worry about having it backslide.  Like I said, anything that promotes a situation where any of the three tanks or three healers or the handful of damage dealers is equally likely to be chosen is good.  If these changes have that happen, sweet, I'm happy.  If it simply makes it so that warriors and knights flip positions, that is ass. And remember, the lesson you should have learned by now is, balance is just as much about perception as it is about fact.</div></div><hr />

Hybrids bring their steenky dirty asses to the fourm I call home, and then try to pass the fucking dim lightbulb thats about to go out in their head's as WORD FROM UP FUCKING HIGH.<br />
<br />
Then they cry that spells GRANTED to them BY THEIR GOD'S dont really &quot;add&quot; anything at all. That they have no meaning. So enter fucking rickshaw_01, who say's. I should tank better then my pimp daddy class the warrior. I should do better DPS then my pimp daddy warrior class. I should take mitigation better.<br />
<br />
All because there spell's are &quot;crutch's&quot; to them. The spells you see, dont give them any edge. There is no spoon per say. Nothing to see here with our casting abilities move along. <br />
<br />
Its myth's and cry me a fucking river stories of I have a spell book with 100 spells and they are all completely FUCKING useless which pisses me off. Now we see a light at the end of a tunnel &quot;Warriors&quot; are getting a endurance bar with our own &quot;neat&quot; abilities that no one knows how they work.<br />
<br />
Guess what, Rickshaw Hybrid_02 is already crying he should get the same amount of abilities his daddy class gets. <br />
This is why we flame Hybrid's. <br />
Because they come to our home and start shit, Ruining it for the few decent Paladin's / Shadowknight's. That have the curtsy to stop by , and carry on a decent polite conversation.<br />
<br />
There is no balance. There is no spoon, But Hybrids are casters of their own right. Paladins are DPS machines agaisnt undead. SK's are damage machines agaisnt anything that can be dot'd. and Oh yeah. THEY BOTH USE EXPLOITS TO TANK MOBS. THUSLY DEGRADING ANY SEMBALANCE OF BALANCE. <br />

<br />
 Well, maybe. If you're of the opinion that hybrid plate classes needed to have counterbalancing flaws of the proportion they had, then yeah, they were balanced.<br />
<br />
 However, most logical players knew that having a mana pool set that low, the xp penalty that hit the group, AND the fact that they tanked worse than anything in game except for Scruffy and Rangers - well, that was too much.<br />

 Were Knights balanced in Kunark? No. Were they balanced by Luclin? Hell yes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is highly agrivating. I hate to break it to you guys, but you have *just* as many idiots and whiners as paladins do. So, lets not try to pretend that this is a haven for people who just want balance.<br />
<br />
 We actually probably have more whiners and idiots than most classes. Since warriors are relatively simple to &quot;play&quot;(not master). So lots of twits end up playing them. I hate it. That all said, we generally confine our stupid to this forum right here(with the notable exception of Ninjaburger and another of our whiney twits on PoV=/). While other classes let it run rampant all over the interweb.<br />
<br />
 I read pretty much every class board somewhat. It saddens me to say that this board actually is one of the more sane ones.</div></div><hr />

I hope it sinks in with one of you. Paladins and Shadowknights probably were balanced during kunark. Guess the fuck what, you guys are pretty balanced now.<br />
<br />
This is the dumbest thing that I have ever read.  I don't play a Warrior, I play a BST.  I guarantee that I can pull aggro from ANY Warrior in 10 seconds, usually it involves a resist of my slow.  I can guarantee if I say &quot;resist&quot;, the Pally or SK will NOT lose aggro.  This has been proven every time I am in an xp or LDON group and let the tank know that if I say &quot;resist&quot; I'm going to probably steal aggro if they don't do something to stop it.<br />
<br />
Come on over to Ayonae Ro and I'll demonstrate it over and over and over and over and over and over and over.... The only hope that the Warrior has is that his Taunt will go off correctly an instant after my 2nd slow hits.  The knight only has to cast 1 spell and he's again not even worried about it.  Don't say anything about the Warrior and his &quot;BoC&quot; because not every (or even better than 10%) Warrior has one and gear isn't supposed to balance a class.  What's really scary is that Warriors now consider some of the best taunt weapons in the game are weapons that stun..... just like the Pally spells.  It isn't &quot;The perception of the rest of the player base.&quot;, it is a gameplay reality that Warriors can not hold aggro (read: Tank, since that is the sole job of a tank is to keep aggro) anywhere near as good as the 1/2 warriors (knights).</div></div><hr />

In the case of Paladins its a minor exploit at most since the spells really don't do much except generate aggro anyway, they aren't even reliable at interrupting casting(cease and desist).  In the case of shadowknights he has more of a point as they use a spell which is only usable for aggro when it becomes immune and that is fear.  No shadowknight would use fear to generate aggro if the mob was not immune, which does seem borderline exploiting.</div></div><hr />

1) I hope you guys enjoy the deserved melee upgrades and superior mitigation. Knight classes don't need either.<br />
<br />
2) I hope Sony also increases your Taunt skill to become more reliable (but not guaranteed...takes the fun out of the game if there are no unknowns). I am concerned that the abilities you do gain will not help you maintain aggro as much as it will give you some needed utility.<br />
<br />
3) I hope they accomplish both of the aforementioned things without the need to nerf my character (or anybody else for that matter).<br />
<br />
4) Generalizing is a bad thing (i.e. racisim). Not all knights are whiney bitches; not all warriors are whiny bitches. Sad thing is that so many are busy fighting each other when the game is supposed to be about comming together and fighting the monsters (Gods, Dragons, etc.).<br />
<br />
5) Try to have fun and good luck.</div></div><hr />

Also Heart Flutter and Asystole both have MUCH larger aggro hits and the added advantage of a nice aggro shot every tic until the spell wears off. However the 2 disadvantages to using these spells are mana cost and casting time.<br />

The problem is. Most Warriors dont go to HYBRID fourms and whine. Hybrids bring their steenky dirty asses to the fourm I call home, and then try to pass the fucking dim lightbulb thats about to go out in their head's as WORD FROM UP FUCKING HIGH.<br />
***<br />
<br />
We are only smart enough to delete such senseless posts.<br />
<br />
Most of you dont know a shit about the knights problem in kunark. You think you have it bad ? The only thing you miss is instant aggro and you will be first choice for most exp/raid tanking again.<br />
<br />
If they give you instant aggro like knight you will be balanced. If they give you all this little tools to you are overbalanced if they are worth more then a symbol from a paladin when you have virtue on you or a groupeheal when all members are at full hps.<br />
<br />
If they dont give you instant aggro but all this tools are great you will still be second choice as tank because caster/healers/light tanks dont care what tools you give them. They only care about if you can save there ass when they got aggro or not. Knights will make it saver because our tools but warriors will make the killing faster because there dps/tanking advantage.<br />
<br />
You know what was the biggest nerf to warriors since the beginning from EQ ?<br />
<br />
THE WINNER IS -&gt; Limited complet heal<br />
<br />
It got this effect bevor the nerf. <br />
Warrior hps 6000 -&gt; Knight 5000.<br />
Warrior got 5000dmg -&gt; Knight got 4000dmg. <br />
(Knight need a heal earlier then warriors).<br />
Warrior at 1000hps -&gt; Knight at 1000hps<br />
Complet heal incoming<br />
Warrior healed for 5000hps -&gt; Knight healed for 4000hps.<br />
Warrior at 6000hps -&gt; knight at 5000<br />
(Warrior again need longer for 2. complet heal.)<br />
<br />
New complet heal is this<br />
Warrior 10000hps -&gt; Knight 9000hps<br />
Warrior get 9000dmg -&gt; Knight get 8000hps<br />
(Paladin again take first heal earlier<br />
Warrior 1000hps -&gt; Knight 1000hps<br />
Complet heal incoming both get healed for 7500hps<br />
(Warrior 8500hps -&gt; Knight 8500hps)<br />
Both are the same tanks now. The only difference is at the start that the knight need the first heal a little ealier. As more classes reach the 9000hps range as more effectiv they tank because complet heal not heal the full hps and both classes are at the same hps after the heal. This will create sooner or later a big problem between light and heavy tankclasses because as more hps we get as smaller the difference in tanking will be between the classes. That they upgrade warrior migration and dont look at this problem show me that they are clueless about the problems from the tankclasses and so the tankclasses are in troubles in the futur because every class can tank effecitv the moment they get over 9500hps and a ranger/monk/roque/mage etc. will allways give the groupe more then a tankclasses because they are designed to make other stuff then tanking.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CyrzB</div><div class="date">12-08-2003, 10:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can't beleive I'm adding to this discussion. :-/<br />
<br />
I switched to warrior when Kunark came out. My roommate joined me in EQ when Kunark came out. I have some knowledge of how both classes worked at the time- Not total, of course.<br />
<br />
As I recall, we were low-mid 40's around the time of most of the Hybrid changes.<br />
<br />
Some of the changes, from the top of my head- <br />
<br />
Manapool/Spell Cost- Spells cost more for a hybrid to cast then the parent class, AND Hybrids had a smaller mana pool. I misremember which they changed, I beleive it was the spell cost. Either way, they essentially got a bigger manapool.<br />
<br />
Melee/Casting- Casting a spell reset the melee timer- IE, with a 40 delay weapon and zero haste, you would swing, cast a 3 second spell, finish casting, then wait 4 seconds to swing again. This was removed- Now you Swing, Cast a 3 second spell, wait 1 second, and swing again.<br />
<br />
Spell Selection- All Hybrid spells were spells the parent class got. An SK would have no/few usefull DoT's, for example, as a necromancer would have a higher level version on the target, and the SK's would not be able to land. <br />
Some more spells, and some Hybrid Specific spells were added, and have continued to be added, to the point were not long ago the necromancers asked for and received a Shadowknight spell (Death Peace, I beleive?).<br />
<br />
Exp- I was a rogue pre-kunark, so again, I have some knowledge, but again, I admit the very real possibility that I am wrong. I was wasn't around for beta, but do know people who were.<br />
The story I got was that Hybrids, as envisioned, would end up more powerfull then Warriors, but payed for it with needing more exp, a la mana RPGs. Very Early (I am unclear if this was late beta or early live game) this idea was discarded, and warrior HP was risen, and critical hits were introduced, etc. However, the Hybrids still required more exp to level. <br />
The exp was changed. <br />
<br />
Skill Caps- It was decided that Hybrids needed upgrades to more firmly establish there Melee role. &quot;Knights&quot; were given a raise to there Defense skill cap to match warriors, and Rangers has Offense raised to match warriors. NOTE- I do not mean all Defensive Skill caps, a la riposte, etc. Everytime I mention this someone points out that dodge, riposte, and parry all cap at lower levels. I mean specifically Defense.<br />
<br />
What is my point? None of these preceding examples are likely to happen again. A return to Kunark is impossible- SoE has changed, and the roles of Hybrids have evolved. You can't go back to the point where a warrior was REQUIRED for an exp group. The point where, even if a Hybrid was just as good as the warrior, he would still slow exp due to the penalty. If warriors got everything that any warrior ever asked for, today, a paladin or shadowknight COULD still tank- They simply couldn't in many cases in Kunark. You can't have the Holy Trinity to the point you did in Kunark.<br />
<br />
Now, lets look at what people really mean (At least what I think you must mean) when they say &quot;Kunark&quot;- They don't want Warriors to Overshadow Knights. I think most of the Sane(r) Warriors, Paladins, and Shadowknights ALL desire that- Not to have any of the tanks overshadow the other, but each to be able to host there own in all/most situations and be desired to group and raid, while still having some differences.<br />
<br />
Of course, all of the Sane(r) people also realize that no agreement will ever be reached... There will always be &quot;Well, you have LoH!&quot; &quot;Well, you have Defensive!&quot; &quot;Well, Pallies can Solo Gore!&quot; and we both mutter &quot;NERF!&quot; when we see a SK crit for 7k+.<br />
<br />
However, I also beleive that most people, if they take an unbiased look at the tanks, will have to admit that warriors do seem a bit lacking at the moment. Whether they need significant upgrades, minor upgrades, or simply more gimmacks to give them some keys to press in battle (IE, to shut us up... :-) depends on where you see that line of balance to be. <br />
<br />
But Cazic H Thule on a Stick! Quit Screaming Kunark!</div></div><hr />

Answer: 5% better mitigation than anyone else in the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Of course, to mitigate you need to be getting hit...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not by much though, which is also why we &quot;only&quot; see a 5% mitigation boost.<br />
<br />
Mind you, I'm still interested on how they want us to be bring more utility to the group, so far I see it mostly aimed at hitting the MOB.<br />
Manapool/Spell Cost- Spells cost more for a hybrid to cast then the parent class, AND Hybrids had a smaller mana pool. I misremember which they changed, I beleive it was the spell cost. Either way, they essentially got a bigger manapool.<br />
<br />
Both was changed, so now Knights use exactly the same formula as Caster classes (ie. Clerics and Necro's) and no longer have the Mana penalty to their spells.<br />
<br />
And then they were given some Paladin / SK only spells, which was a good move IMO, made the Paladins and SK's more defined as a class in themselves.</div></div><hr />
