<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Compo</div><div class="date">05-22-2003, 10:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Depends on what the item you have in the other slot.<br />
<br />
For example, if you have a sweet belt like Heavy Rubite (sp) Gridle (25ac 85hp 4sta), pick Cloak of Flame.<br />
<br />
If you have a sweet cloak like Cloak of Destruction (100hp I believe), pick the Spiked Seahorse Hide Belt.<br />
<br />
But utimately, you may want to free up both Back and Waist slot for HP gears and use haste item on other slots such as Neck (the PoI dragon Choker) or Head (Cowl of Mortality).</div></div><hr />

Selling Spiked Sea Horse<br />
<br />
Getting Cloak of Flames <br />
<br />
Then getting more HP belt<br />
<br />
So was curious what others think</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ahnaksunamun</div><div class="date">05-22-2003, 11:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Belt isn't the same haste as the CoF, a little slower (34% I believe).  It depends on if you're a number cruncher or not.  When I was looking to upgrade my haste, I was really leaning towards the belt.  Its cheaper than the CoF, and I can get a better cloak than the CoF fairly easy.  But, I was urged to go with the CoF instead, because of the 2% haste difference.  So, thats what I wear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grendonbb</div><div class="date">05-22-2003, 01:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cloak of Flames + Heavy Rubicite Girdle = Great.  Only time you'll end up with better hp combo in cloak/waist and still have decent haste is if you either end up with a high end no drop haste item, or pick up a cowl of mortality.  Otherwise, CoF + HRG = The Win.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baadan</div><div class="date">05-22-2003, 03:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am prolly gonna go with Sea Horse + Cloak of Greater Pernicty.<br />
<br />
That's 22ac 14sta 75hp 34% Haste 29str 4agi 4dex 1svALL. Cost: 50k<br />
<br />
CoF + HRG is 35ac 4sta 135hp 36% Haste 4str 9agi 9dex 19svF 4svC. Cost: 80k</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cyphan</div><div class="date">05-22-2003, 08:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heavy Rubicite Girdle + CoF &gt; Spiked Seahorse + Hiero Cloak or Cloak of Greater Pernicity<br />
<br />
The CoF and HRG will cost more but you will have higher AC, higher raw HPs (not counting Sta), 2percent more haste and better saves. The AC and HPs is all that you should be worrying about though.<br />
<br />
Of course the even more expensive alternative is getting haste moved to head slot with a Cowl of Mortality but youre getting best of everything.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ive had to pass up so many nice belts because i couldnt get haste off my belt, now im slapping myself in the head cause i havent had a decent belt drop in ages.<br />
<br />
CoF all the way.  No contest.  Too many nice belts out there to waste the slot on haste.<br />
<br />
hating myself i didnt go cloak haste earlier.</div></div><hr />
