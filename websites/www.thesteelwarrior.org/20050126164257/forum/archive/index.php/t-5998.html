<br />
That's all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are you starting from scratch or do you already have some gear on your Warrior? Your magelo link isn't working, post that and we can get to work on what gear would suit you best.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Evariste</div><div class="date">03-03-2004, 04:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since your username is One Wise Gnome, I'm assuming you're a gnome. In the hopes that you worship Rallos Zek, get a full set of Fierce Heraldic (80kish on my server) or get some Fine Heraldic or the Gnome clockwork armor otherwise (especially hasted legs), couple of 6 AC 65 HP rings (until you're old enough to buy Gallantry rings), some 30 HP earrings (until you're old enough to buy Mosquito Legs). <br />
<br />
For weapons, get the best efficiency for the cost for each slot: Sword of the Bloodsworn 1HS, Copper Hammer of Strinking 1HB, Witness of Hate Greatstaff 2HB, War Marshall's 2HS, and the 13/21 Goblin dagger (forgot the name, sells for about 500pp) to work up piercing (don't bother with 2HP since 1HP works it up anyway). <br />
<br />
With leftover cash you should be able to get a Cloak of Flames; if not, pick up a Cloak of Crystalline Waters or a Siblisian Berserker's Cloak instead. <br />
<br />
Oh yeah, and a Goranga Idol or a Idol of the Throned/Wavecrasher if you have leftover cash. <br />
<br />
Hope that helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Evariste</div><div class="date">03-03-2004, 04:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">By the way, if you're not rolling a Gnome, pick a Barbarian that worships Seven Hammers if you wanna go that route. The Helanic Tundra armor they get has the same HP as Fierce Heraldic, and much more Stamina to boot. <br />
<br />
Until you're about Level 30, the racial armor won't affect you much. Pick up some cheapo stuff like Dragonhide armor or something in the meantime.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telen</div><div class="date">03-03-2004, 05:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm on Stromm, only seen one helmet of RZ for sale ever, for 175k.  On our server that is quite the bargain I'd say.  I had 125k, tried to deal, but trader was afk, then it was gone a few hours later.  Haven't seen one since.  That helmet just rocks.  But....  obviously it would make no sense to blow pp on one item.  :p<br />
<br />
The other suggestions are right on.  FH armor or HT.  SotB, CHoS.  CoF or CoCW or even Soulscream Belt or Spiked Seahorse.  Good armor, good weps, good haste.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">One_Wise_Gnome</div><div class="date">03-03-2004, 05:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">do you think i would still need to pick up cheep armor if i use my 58 shaman to pl me up ?<br />
<br />
and thanks for the advice<br />
<br />
right now its between gnome and ogre. for what class going to see what i like best at the charactor select screen when i get back to the us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goyan</div><div class="date">03-03-2004, 05:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would recommend a halfling warrior that follows Rallos zek.  In my opinion, that exp bonus is still worth it.  I would recommend getting 2 gallantry rings, FH greaves/arms/bracer.</div></div><hr />
