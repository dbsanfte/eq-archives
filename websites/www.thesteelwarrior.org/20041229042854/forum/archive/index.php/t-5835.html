<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DabrixMGP</div><div class="date">02-24-2004, 02:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bunch of old friends moved to the new server and I was thinking about doing the same.  Made a monk at first but I noticed there are hardly any tanks on the server since everyone and their brother made a berserker.  So I think I might roll up a tank.  Was thinking either warrior or shadow knight.  I haven't played either but I think I know enough to make a start then learn as I go.  Was wondering which would be better starting out non-twinked and who would keep better agro?  I am guessing SK cause hes got his spells but I dont know what new changes were made to warriors in the last patch.  I havent played since LDoN was released.  I also plan on taking this guy to 65.  Thanks for any help.</div></div><hr />

I play a SK as main but also enjoy the time I spend playing my warrior.  The new disc's arent near snap agro but they do help.</div></div><hr />

Since I will be grouping 100% of the time I could care less about soloing.  I am just making this character to be a tank.</div></div><hr />

Warrior will take a little less damage.<br />
<br />
Overall, if you aren't going to be raiding, I'd say go SK.  You'll have more fun.  Warriors really shine at raids, not in exp group situations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Woojed</div><div class="date">02-24-2004, 08:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I disagree, I think a warrior can hold great aggro if everyone knows what they are doing.  If you plan to take the char to 65, definitly make a warrior.  If you want a true tank, make a warrior.  If you want a warrior with a few cheap tricks, make a SK.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anheg</div><div class="date">02-24-2004, 08:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The warrior is the tank.  So if you want to be a Tank then be a warrior.  Yes SK's can get aggroe faster and drain clerics of all their mana faster. But a good SK would not be taking aggroe while there is a warrior in the group. You need to make sure you use your taunt and disc everyfight . Make sure you have anger proc weapon or two and you can hold aggroe. Since the new disc and tech. have been added playing a warrior is how I always hoped it would be.  <br />
<br />
Take the road of responsability and get all defensive aa's and you will far out weigh the value of Pally's and Sk's as  tanks.  This of course  will cause your time of anguish to be extended, due to your low dps.<br />
<br />
After you get all your defensive aa's start working on the dps aa's and you will soon see Warriors can contribute as dps.  Increasing the warriors ability to strike through or to strike more times in any given melee round  will make a huge difference in your ability to hold aggroe. You will also find you don't need to hit that taunt quite as much.<br />
<br />
Fast weapons with high anger augs are a must.  If you are a warrior with 200 aa's and high anger aug procs with low weapon delay speed, Aggroe should never be a problem.  A pally or SK would have to be really trying to get aggroe or depending on circumstances may just be in their aea of strength such as fighting undead.  I was discouraged about the warrior for a while till I met another warrior  Rafather.  He is a great example of the dsp potential of a warrior.  We did an LDoN together and being the main tank in most of the groups I can tell you this warrior with maxed out aa's was indeed uber.  <br />
<br />
After tanking with Rafather I realized there is light at then end of the tunnel for me and if I can stick with it I will be most pleased with my warriors abilities.  No memming spells or worrying about mana , just pure innate abilities carrying me through a battle.  And if trouble arrises I still have my disc and tech.'s The simple but powerful way of a warrior is the life for me.   :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smohg</div><div class="date">02-24-2004, 02:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If your just going to be hanging around one group - SK might be a better choice. Depends on where you want to hunt of course; I'd pick a warrior if you guys were just planning on being outdoors. Also depends on your group make up. If your going to have a beastlord to slow, a monk to pull, druid as healer, and only have one caster in the group - that's a good set up for warrior since if the others do catch aggro they won't die in a few shots - if its a group with one cleric, one tank, an enchanter and 3 wizards - well, SK/Pal is the superior choice.<br />
<br />
SK's do have a nice line up of spells at their disposal which can really help if you've only got 6 friends you'll even see. Your group might not have a necro (corpse summons), or a monk (FD), and the loss in tanking ability won't be so signifigant that you'll have much longer downtime. Add to that, the aggro that SK can generate is better than warriors, so your healer will spend most of his mana on you can not the wizard. <br />
<br />
All in all - SK bring more to the table than warriors do - although on raids its nice to have WELL GEARED warriors doing the fighting since they do take damage better and also can close the gap on the aggro advantage of knights. But you're not going to do that, and are only taking this guy to mid-level.<br />
<br />
Mid-level for warriors IMO is the worst because the advantage of tanking isn't felt when the mob only hits for 50-100 and aggro is a major issue for warriors around that level.<br />
<br />
I'm on MR now, so send me a tell if you have any questions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zynth</div><div class="date">02-24-2004, 04:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">if you make a warrior from scratch you're going to need alot of help from your friends to get your warrior to the point where he's lvl effectent. a SK would be alot easier for normal group exp, LDoN and so on.<br />
on the other hand, if not alot of people are making tanks on this server you'd do very well to be one of the first 65 warriors. that would almost easily gurantee a guild as well as a tanking spot depending on how often/well you play. <br />
how far do you see yourself taking this character? what are your short term goals and what are your long term goals?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DabrixMGP</div><div class="date">02-24-2004, 04:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am taking this guy to 65.  I think now there are a few more people coming including 2-3 warriors.  I think they said we are going to start a small family type guild not really a heavy raiding guild but do small stuff like BoT, Rhags, Rumble, Va'dyn, Vindi, ToV, ect which by reading around both here and the SK board that either class tank tank these MoBs.  I think we will prob have 20-25 people on now that I have talked to my friends and have a little better knowing of what we will have for classes.  Think theres 2 druids, 2 shaman, 4 clerics for healing.  Im 50/50 for either class so either way I will be happy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A SK is alot more gear dependant on tanking those mobs then a 55 war w/ defensive is.  Back when we were doing Vindi a few nice hits would have left me waiting on a rez.  Now thanks to levels/aa's/newer gear he is a joke.  <br />
<br />
If your going to be tanking go w/ the war as you'll be able to do it w/ gear you can farm at those levels.  If your going SK you need to get gear better then that war would to tank the same mobs.</div></div><hr />

I know this seems obvious, but why play what class you think people need, when you should be playing what you have the most fun at? <br />
<br />
And, LDON way changed alot of things for the melee. The gear you can get is awsome, not to mention weapons augmentations (yes, this takes thousands of points, but its worth it)</div></div><hr />
