<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Greyslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ring from Jiva is nice and maybe his 1hander also.  I think Dresolik drops a decent necklace I forget.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Pumilio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">any info on solesk fight?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Raunstonecutter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sol Ro hits for around 2k, had a 2k proc on MA (I think), and had an ae that his for 1k three times.<br />
<br />
Otherwise, he's a wuss!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>turkishbull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ring and 1hs from Jiva, Necklace from Arylixr, and a 2hs that is like a mini Blade of War, procs Taunting Blow i think, is on your way to fight the Protector of Drisolisk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Raunstonecutter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Obsidian Greatblade I think is the name of it.  Its in my inventory.  I put anger 2 on it, and it's pretty dencet for grouping, but I wouldn't dare use it on a raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">xp here and get full set of ornate</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Pumilio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ornate is overrated in many slots. <br />
<br />
like why go ornate bracer over fierce heraldic&gt;?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Batem Tuhates</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Diety<br />
<br />
BTW a full set of ornate will you 530 Raw HP's were as a set of FH visable gear gets you 500hp with out the effects</div></div><hr />

rampages and has a ~ 150 pt damage shield that can be removed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Dakryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Effects on Kizraks &gt; Non effect Fierce, not to mention good for non RZ worshippers.<br />
Ornate drops are VERY sporadic though</div></div><hr />

True Dat!<br />

Get that damage shield removed fast and before you have your melee assist or watch them all drop faster than any AE will kill ya.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Raunstonecutter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I wasn't tanking =)  So I was a good little dorf and just smaked him around he he =)  But good to know for future reference =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jarelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Thing is, most of the HP that Ornate gives over FH come from the BP and Legs and aren't that common as drops...if you can wear FH or Helanic, then don't fret too much about ornate...the BP is probably the only part worth spending DKP or whatever on...legs have right clicky stam, and on raids thats given out by shammy, also stam is incredibly easy to max out, esp with LDoN now around.<br />
<br />
Id say the Basalt Ring off Jiva and Collar of Corrupted Flame from the big flaming bird who's name I can never spell are good...plus the 2hs off Dresolik..with the boil blood effect...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Couple other things:   <br />
<br />
- Everyone needs to be flagged by killing all the minis (and clicking the portal out of their rooms) in order to be able to zone up to Sol Ro chamber without doing gay raid pushes.<br />
<br />
- Those that are Sol Ro Tower flagged, but not Sol Ro chamber flagged can be &quot;pushed&quot; into his chamber (85% rule), and even if they leave the raid won't be ported out.<br />
<br />
- When you go up into Sol Ro Chamber, port up ready to fight, you will be aggroed by 2 relatively nasty guards on a 45 minute respawn.<br />
<br />
- Organizing Sol Ro kills with some people flagged for chamber and some not flagged for chamber, and some flagged for zone and some not flagged for zone is a *very* major pain in the butt and time consuming process, so be ready to spend some time dealing with &quot;raiding people in&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>aspit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">no plain and simple.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Pumilio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I haven't been in a e-plane yet, but the drops in sol ro were disappoiunting when I looked em up after getting flagged.<br />
<br />
Also the ornate statment,  sorry better ac and hp is greater then 10attack and a few others in the bracer slot.  sure legs are a little better and BP alot better. that's about it though.</div></div><hr />
