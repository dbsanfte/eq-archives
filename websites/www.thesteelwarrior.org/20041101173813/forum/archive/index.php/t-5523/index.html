<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>RazorEdge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Another newb question here, but since it's important, I figured I'd ask :) <br />
<br />
My first ever warrior is now lvl 43. His stamina is nowhere near max. My question is, when looking for gear should I focus on items that give raw HP or + stamina?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>slyse</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">at the point you're at, I would say both.<br />
<br />
Just kinda look for gear that blends sta, hp, and ac in such a way that you feel comfortable.  As you get better gear, your sta will start to get closer to max and you can start looking for raw hp gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Slyse's advice seems pretty good to me. I'd add that it's helpful to pay attention to opportunity costs when you're seeking to upgrade various stats. Try to get a sense of how good each piece of gear you now have is, relative to other gear out there, and search very carefully in the bazaar to see what gives you the biggest bang for the buck.<br />
Also, some slots provide easier routes to some stats than other slots. For example, rings are not necessarily the place to go to dramatically upgrade your AC on the cheap, but I priced Platinum fire wedding rings (AC +5, hp +55) at 250pp on my server the other day. Velium fire wedding rings (AC +6, hp +65) were 550 pp. Depending on what you are wearing now in ring slots, 12 AC and 130 hps for 1100 pp might seem like a good idea. Or, you can mix and match. I saw band of the bloodguard assassin--AC+5, hp +43, Sv cold 15, sv magic 12--for 550 pp. One less AC and 22 fewer hps than a velium ring, but pretty cheap magic and cold saves on balance.<br />
Server prices vary of course. The important thing is that you get a good sense of how good (or bad) each piece of your gear is, and what the market is like for upgrades. Then you can balance what you have with what's out there and how long you think you might use the upgrade item (sometimes cheaper gear is actually more expensive in the long run because you have to upgrade all the time and may not be able to sell your old gear for what you bought it for).<br />
Hmmm. On the other hand, EQ isn't entirely a matter of applying business school economic theory to maximize your efficiency, either, lol.<br />
The cheapest way to more hitpoints is to make sure your cleric doesn't die, heh.</div></div><hr />
