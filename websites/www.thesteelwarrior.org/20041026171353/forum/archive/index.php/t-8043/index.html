<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cister Battle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was wondering what some of the boards more seasoned vets may think about where to go next for me.  Ldons are pretty trivial although I havent done but 1 hard due to lack of a ready and trusted chanter.  As a 65 war, my ac is running around 1605 buffed with about 7200 hps.  My aas are ca3, cs3, nd1, pe.  I am a pretty casual player, playing between 12-16 hrs a week.<br />
<br />
After reading the boards, Im thinking to go toward some god zones.  I havent been to any of the god zones since it first came out and then it was with my 65 magi.  We got squashed and never went back basically.  I really dont know anything about the zones in difficulty nor drops for upgrades.  What zone is the easiest for a 65  and where from there?<br />
<br />
My group usually consists of a 65 necro, 65 Bst, 65 Cleric, 65 War (me), and 2 others usually a 65 rogue or 65 wiz etc.  Hardly ever a shm or chanter.  Bst and Necro have 150+ aas.<br />
<br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Start off with dark blue nocs in Natimbi.  You should find them to be trivial, and medium XP.  Then zone into Qinimi and try mobs there.  I suggest pulling to the Ferubi zone line but you can try any part of the zone.  Qinimi mobs are somewhat like normal LDON these days, in both difficulty and XP, and you should find them pretty easy too, perhaps boring.  When you want to try something harder, invis and run from there to Riwwi.  Try mobs at the zone line inside Riwwi first, then head into the open areas, and then into the arena.  You will probably find your comfort level somewhere in Riwwi.  If it's still too easy then move on to Barindu.  The mobs in Barindu will not be trivial, but you still might have faced harder mobs in POP or hard LDON with your group in the past.</div></div><hr />
