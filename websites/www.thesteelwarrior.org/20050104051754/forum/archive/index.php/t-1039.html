I plan on being level 51 by Monday.  Since I more than likely won't be used as a MT for my guild for a while I want to purchase a nice 2hs to deal some damage with.  My 3 options are a Stonebladed Axe of Dismay, 44/44 w/75hp required lvl 51.  A Tae Ew Twohanded Sword which is 34/35 w/6 str and 100hp required lvl 51 or, well I can't think of the name atm but its 35/35 w/8 str and 25ac reccomended lvl 53.  There are other stats on most of these weapons but none of them really effect warriors.   <br />
     I'm mainly leaning towards the 44/44 seeing as how it is usually cheapest and from what I hear generally deals the most damage.  Oh well, thanks in advance to anyone who chooses to help me.  <br />
                                                               Akamek</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Szerath</div><div class="date">06-05-2003, 02:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well the Axe and Tae Ew have almost the same DSP..a hair better on the Axe...but the added HP and resists the Tae Ew bring with it are nice. +14 to both  DR and PR. Not sure what the other weapon is and would want to see all the stats to recomend something.  Looking at all these...if you can go for the 35/35 25 ac one...if not then the Tea Ew for the added HP and resists.<br />
<br />
Yes the Axe hits hard..but DPS is DPS...you do the same damge over all with any of these really.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">06-05-2003, 10:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would say Axe or Tae Ew.  With widebladed greatsword, you lose out on a bunch of hps, and since you said you won't be MT, the ac will do nothing for you.  The resists on the Tae Ew are good also, and since you're not MT the biggest threat to you is ae's, so resists are something you'll want to look at.  Overall, I'd say Tae Ew, it has more hps, more resists, and only a minor difference in ratio.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">akamek</div><div class="date">06-05-2003, 11:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, the 35/35 is a Widebladed Greatsword, sorry about that I remembered the name like 2 seconds before I fell asleep lol.  It looks like the Tae Ew one is the overall winner, so I'll prolly grab one this weekend.  Too bad I'm not lucky enough to be MT for our guild and I have to just bust out a 2hander but oh well with time maybe.  I was actually hoping to get something atleast w/a 1:1 ratio but now that ya'll have me thinking about resists and AoE's then yeah the Tae Ew will probably be my best bet.  Now does anyone happen to have a screenie or can you maybe tell me what it looks like? <br />
                                                     Thanks again, Akamek</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">06-05-2003, 03:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just thought I'd add another layer of complexity here.  :)  If you're the ST, you may need that extra AC if the MT falls, or to offtank adds.  If something has a ratio of something near 1, I'd go with whichever one has the best stats for what you plan to be doing.   I'd say you're right on the money with the Tae Ew.<br />
<br />
Beo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Macnair</div><div class="date">06-05-2003, 05:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have used both the Wideblade and Tae Ew 2her.  They are both nice but I sold the Tae Ew and kept the Wideblade greatsword.  <br />
<br />
Stats on it are<br />
<br />
Widebladed Greatsword<br />
MAGIC ITEM  LORE ITEM  <br />
Slot: PRIMARY  <br />
Skill: 2H Slashing  Atk Delay: 35<br />
DMG: 35  AC: 25<br />
STR: +8  WIS: +5  INT: +5  AGI: +5  <br />

Recommended level of 53.<br />
WT:  6.5    Size: LARGE<br />
Class: WAR PAL RNG SHD <br />
Race: ALL<br />
<br />
It seemed to hit more consistantly harder then the Tae Ew.  It also has a nicer grafix.  Although 100 HP are nice the 25 AC on the wideblade was better for me.  I still use the Wideblade as my main weapon.</div></div><hr />
