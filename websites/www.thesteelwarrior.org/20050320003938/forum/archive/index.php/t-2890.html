<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elmysterio</div><div class="date">09-05-2003, 05:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ive had my ups and downs through my EQ career, but I am feeling kinda down about recent events, mainly my Guild that I have been in since 99 has pretty much disbanded only about 5 folks left.  I am the only one ever on pretty much, which means It feels like Im not even guilded.   <br />
<br />
Anyway this guild has always been a small family type guild, no uber raids, at our peak about 6 folks or so had their epics give or take.  Now I wonder what to do,  do I trudge on alone or seek out an active guild to hunt with.   I'm lvl 55 atm, no AA's no flags, just a lone Wood Elf warrior.<br />
<br />
Sorry if this seems much for my first ever post, but its been weighing on my mind for awhile now, and I have been reading this forum for awhile now, and have found the people here to be quite knowledgeable. <br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trast</div><div class="date">09-05-2003, 09:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm sorry to hear about your guild folding. Its always a sad thing when that happens. On my server we had a well respected and established guild called Bloods Guard fold up. Much to my guilds benefit a good deal of its members were welcomed into my own guild and we gained a lot of quality folks. <br />
<br />
What I am saying is that the ending you are experiencing now can also be a beginning. The Bloods Guards that joined us have gotten to finish their goal of making it to Vex Thal with us. You and your friends who remain might be able to join another guild help make that guild better while continuing the formers legacy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valeris</div><div class="date">09-05-2003, 10:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Guildless warriors will have a much tougher time gearing up to be able to tank well without raiding etc in the later levels. It can be done but it'll occupy a lot of your time. If you have the time to be able to raid it probably behooves you to do so. plus the extended family can make it easier to find groups. Finding a guild that suits you and your time commitments is the trick of course :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elmysterio</div><div class="date">09-09-2003, 12:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for understanding everyone, and for the suggestions. Currently I am applying to the guild where most of my former companions went.  Might seem trivial to some switching guilds, but I have been in this one my whole Everquest career and the decision wasnt hard, it was just doing it that was the tough part.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Qris</div><div class="date">09-09-2003, 12:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guild recently broke up because the leader (Tormentcia, Queen of the Bitches) came back and messed everything up.  Many retired and we all separated, sucked so much, I loved that guild.<br />
<br />
Anyway, a lot of us hang out in a channel in order to stay in touch even though we're not guilded.  We've all gone to guilds with a few other former members, with some exceptions.<br />
<br />
I'd recommend finding a guild though, you create new friendships and it gives you something to do.  Also, if they can equip you it will be much easier to progress when you're higher level.<br />
