http://www.infowars.com/  (some crazy crap on this site, but alot of it also shows support and proof, use a level head when reading it)<br />
http://www.suntimes.com/output/news/cst-nws-illegal08.html<br />
<br />
i wanted to see what you all thought  of the proposed &quot;nest egg&quot;<br />
<br />
basically someone who comes into the US illegaly may work here, and then take the money they put into SS when they leave.<br />
<br />
what i think is going on, and my beefs<br />
<br />
1st reason that has me mad, they are saying this is a good idea because there are to many to control.... following this line of thought we should take away drinking laws, there so many offenders that its just to hard to watch *cry/sob* so lets make it legal.....<br />
<br />
first of all, they break into the country, thats one offense,use false ID to get a job, second offense, third they evade taxes, third offense, so since most of the imigrants are in texas(the ones im talking about) they have broken the 3 strikes thing, they HAVE to go to jail, but guess what? now our pres wants to make it legal for them to work, and when they decide to leave they get to take their social sec. money with them, basically heres what i think the goals of this system is, basically the law treats the people here legally WORSE than it does people that break in and break the law, thats enough to make me upset because we need to take care of ourselves when we have 4 million with only part time employment(and they want full time but cant get it) and around 9 million with no jobs, 5 million of that have been that way for more than 3 months(got that data from feed the children)<br />
<br />
1. bankrupt SS, president bush had wanted to privatise social sec. he got blocked, not enough people wanted it, now think about this, if he can give away enough nest eggs fast enough he can tell congress that, given the numbers, we have to close it down, and let people keep their cash, then all the poor SoBs that are about to retire( and were ment to at 50, but then they raised the retirement age right before they could retire) cant get their retirement benefits, plus, all the money that was used from it to support the retarded and disabled isnt there anymore.<br />
<br />
so that is 2 LARGE groups that the government wouldnt have to pay if they ended it(baby boomers and disabled people)<br />
<br />
2. he is doing this for the minority vote, no one that knows a illegal imigrant wants them to be deported, myself included this possible new law would please as many as its PO's<br />
<br />
eh, im on the anti bush side, and i really havent read enough on social security to be sure i will be back when i know more, so tell me what ya think and please keep insults like &quot;pinko, commey, hippie&quot; or any of that other crap to yourself, keep this a intelligent conversation</div></div><hr />

Bush: Let illegal aliens work in U.S. <br />
<br />
January 8, 2004<br />
<br />
BY JENNIFER LOVEN Advertisement<br />

<br />
<br />
WASHINGTON -- Promoting a plan that could brighten his election year prospects with Hispanic voters, President Bush on Wednesday proposed legal status -- at least temporarily -- for millions of illegal immigrants working in the United States.<br />
<br />
But the sweeping policy overhaul, offered with few specifics, also angered many in the president's conservative Republican base of support and drew criticism from advocacy groups who questioned whether it would do much to help immigrants.<br />
<br />
Democrats were united in calling the plan a political ploy that offers a false promise of legitimacy for the undocumented workers.<br />
<br />
Decrying a system that now has ''millions of hard-working men and women condemned to fear and insecurity in a massive undocumented economy,'' Bush urged Congress to approve a temporary worker program.<br />
<br />
The program would be open to all undocumented workers now in the United States. Applicants who can show they have a job -- or for those still in their home countries, a job offer -- would get an initial three-year work permit that would be renewable for an unspecified period.<br />
<br />
&quot;We should have immigration laws that work and make us proud. Yet today we do not,'' Bush said in the White House's East Room, which he entered to loud cheers from dozens of representatives from Hispanic organizations and immigration groups.<br />
<br />
Senate Judiciary Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) praised Bush for opening the debate and said a new immigration policy should ''extend a welcoming hand to those whose presence will benefit our nation and our economy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Allowing undocumented workers, who make up an unknown percentage of the around 8 million illegal immigrants now in the United States, to work legally here would benefit all Americans, Bush argued. He said it would make the nation's borders more secure by allowing officials to focus more on the real threats to the country and would meet U.S. employers' dire need for workers willing to take the low-wage, low-skill jobs unwanted by many Americans.<br />
<br />
It also is the right thing to do, Bush said, to pull immigrants who now live in the shadows of American society under the protection of U.S. labor laws, allow them to travel freely back and forth to their home countries, bring dependents they can support here with them and grant them the confidence to talk openly to authorities about crimes and exploitation on the job.<br />
<br />
&quot;One of the primary reasons America became a great power in the 20th century is because we welcomed the talent and the character and the patriotism of immigrant families,'' the president said. ''We must make our immigration laws more rational and more humane. And I believe we can do so without jeopardizing the livelihoods of American citizens.&quot;<br />
<br />
But even as Bush made the announcement, the tough sales job ahead for the White House was apparent as the president's plan drew heated criticism from both the right and the left.<br />
<br />
Many conservatives balked at the idea of any reward for people who broke the law by coming to the United States.<br />
<br />
''I'm not for allowing illegals to stay in this country,'' said Rep. Virgil Goode (R-Va.). ''I think they should have to go back to their home countries ... and get in line with Jack, Suzy and John and apply for a guest worker position.''<br />
<br />
With about half of the illegal immigrants estimated to be from Mexico, the program was designed in part to win Bush increased support among the powerful Hispanic voting bloc in the November presidential election. He won just over one-third of that constituency in 2000.<br />

Proposal falls short, activists here complain <br />
<br />
BY LUCIO GUERRERO Staff Reporter <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
President Bush's plan to overhaul the country's immigration laws would have a major impact in Chicago, home to an estimated 250,000 undocumented workers, or about 5 percent of the local work force.<br />
<br />
But local immigration advocates said the proposal doesn't go far enough to really make a difference. They are angered that the plan does not give illegal immigrants living in Chicago any assurances of gaining U.S. citizenship.<br />
<br />
&quot;President Bush is starting to look like all cowboy hat and no beef,&quot; said Juan Salgado, president of the board of the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights. &quot;We want to send a clear message to President Bush: We've heard the campaign rhetoric before, and it is not enough.&quot;<br />
<br />
The advocacy group is concerned that the proposal will only expose and exploit undocumented workers by giving them legal status to work for a short period and then demanding they go back to their country of origin.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's saying, 'Give us your sweat and your taxes,' but then gives them nothing back in return,&quot; said Joshua Hoyt, executive director of the ICIRR. &quot;This won't be acceptable to anyone who cares about immigrant rights.&quot;<br />
<br />
The program would be open to all undocumented workers now in the United States. Applicants who can show they have a job -- or for those in their home countries, a job offer -- would get an initial three-year work permit, renewable for an unspecified period.<br />
<br />
The plan would be designed so the undocumented workers would eventually go back to their home countries. Bush proposed letting those immigrants have a tax-free savings account for money to use once they go back to their countries of origin.<br />
<br />
&quot;This new system will be more compassionate,&quot; Bush said. &quot;Decent, hardworking people will now be protected by labor laws, with the right to change jobs, earn fair wages, and enjoy the same working conditions that the law requires for American workers.&quot;<br />
<br />
In Chicago's Latino community, news of the proposal was met with some skepticism. Many scoffed at the idea of coming forward to only be given temporary status, but others like the idea of being able to travel back and forth to Mexico without fear of deportation.<br />
<br />
&quot;We can come and go like any other American citizen,&quot; said Alberto Sanchez, 28, an undocumented worker. But Sanchez said he did not like the idea of having to go back to Mexico once the guest worker status expired.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is my home now, this is where I want to be,&quot; he said. &quot;Mexico is my past; this is my future.&quot;<br />

Business groups in favor but have questions <br />
<br />
BY DAVID ROEDER Business Reporter <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Business groups in the Chicago area voiced qualified support Wednesday for President Bush's proposal to confer legal status on undocumented immigrants who hold jobs in the United States, while the leading voice of labor attacked the plan for not going far enough.<br />
<br />
Liberalizing immigration laws could help companies address chronic labor shortages, business leaders said. But they said they want to see the details first.<br />
<br />
Among their concerns is whether the Bush plan will enforce new record-keeping requirements on employers. They also wondered if by simply applying for amnesty, illegals could implicate their employers for violations of an immigration law dating from 1986.<br />
<br />
The so-called Immigration Control and Reform Act conferred amnesty on undocumented workers then in the United States but imposed strict penalties on employers for knowingly hiring illegals.<br />
<br />
&quot;This raises a lot of issues from an employer's perspective,'' said Gerald Skoning, senior partner at the law firm Seyfarth Shaw LLP, which handles employment issues from management's side.<br />
<br />
One intent of Bush's plan is to match foreign workers with jobs in the United States that people here don't want. That's laudable, said Gerald Roper, president of the Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce, but it could pit that group against native-born Americans.<br />
<br />
As the economy improves, businesses should rehire those downsized out of a job or making do with reduced wages and benefits, he said.<br />
<br />
For years, labor unions opposed increases in immigration, arguing the newcomers held down wages. But they've adopted a different position in recent years as immigrants have come to dominate job ranks in restaurants, hotels and other service sectors that unions are trying to organize.<br />
<br />
AFL-CIO President John Sweeney criticized Bush for not backing a proposal that would lead to citizenship for illegals. &quot;The plan deepens the potential for abuse and exploitation of these workers while undermining wages and labor protections for all workers,'' he said.<br />
<br />
Critics of U.S. immigration policies contend it's a myth that Americans don't want low-wage jobs in restaurants, housekeeping or landscaping. Business leaders said their experience shows otherwise.<br />
<br />
Competition for kitchen help has raised those wages, yet the jobs are hard to fill, said Colleen McShane, president of the Illinois Restaurant Association. She said Bush's proposal would improve the lives of today's workers without encouraging more illegal immigration.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">01-09-2004, 03:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">another reason i feel this is unfair, he says they have to have a job and be here, or a job offer.<br />
<br />
we DO limit how many people come in from each country, this would make mexico pretty much excempt from that as long as you can run from the border control fast enough.<br />
<br />
also, the main reason they get hired is because they will take a meal and 20 dollors as a days pay, if they become real workers(as far as law goes) they will get minimum wage, thus the reason for hiring them is gone..... not that it matters since most of our tech jobs are going over seas to the east :/<br />
<br />
i also think it is wrong to reward law breakers, and about that load of crap<br />
<br />
we give taxes so we should be able to stay......<br />
<br />
you work, you pay taxes, the road you travel and cause wear on is payed for with taxes, that is how it is, if your here for 3 years you have PLENTY of time to aquire the needed english skills, knowledge of the nations history, and most of the info you need to pass the imigration test to become a member of the USA, stop being lazy work for it, dont cry that it isnt falling on top of you<br />
<br />
<br />
The plan would be designed so the undocumented workers would eventually go back to their home countries. Bush proposed letting those immigrants have a tax-free savings account for money to use once they go back to their countries of origin. <br />
<br />
why cant normal americans, or legal imigrants get the same thing if they move out of the country, why cant old people take out their SS for when they WANT to retire, instead of having to WAIT FOR THE RETIRMENT AGE YOU KEEP RAISING! i really hate how he is trying to get votes, and if this somehow passes(i think he doesnt really want it to, its all for the votes) they will be treated better(tax wise) than normal americans, why the hell dont i just go join mexico and then sneak back in so I can get all the nice benefits?<br />
<br />
and with our econmey already sucking arse, this takes MORE money out of our country and into other countrys..... what the hell is bush thinking?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">slyse</div><div class="date">01-12-2004, 02:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the funniest (read: saddest) thing about recent actions by bush and his cronies is the fact that they started to require fingerprinting and mug shots for people entering the country with legally acquired visas and passports, but then turn around and give such a sweet deal to those who are in the US illegally.  Can we say hypocrite?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Steenky</div><div class="date">01-12-2004, 05:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So let me see if I get this straight.<br />
<br />
They get to work illegally, and use SS as a savings fund which they can cash-out on when they go back home?<br />
<br />
I'll be lucky if SS isn't gone by the time I get (if I get) old enough to claim it, all the while I must pay in. Seems like something a rich son of a rich family would think would be ok. Hell, it's not like anyone he knows needs the chump-change SS gives out.<br />
<br />
Maybe I would understand it if I was rich enough to qualify as a Republican.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually what was funnier was the whining that emerged from US State Department when Brazil decided to get &quot;revenge&quot; with equally invasive requirements at its airports for US citizens only.  Its only &quot;fair&quot; when its unilateral baby!</div></div><hr />
