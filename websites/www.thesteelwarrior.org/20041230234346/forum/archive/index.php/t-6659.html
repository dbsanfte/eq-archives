(This is for a monk btw, just that nobody reads the newbie section in Monkly Business so I figured I might get some help here, sorry if this is the wrong forum)<br />
<br />
Say if I got to lvl 55 and did a few aa's like natural durability and combat agility, then I deleveled down to 52 (My guild is going to farm vox and naggy for a while to be rich, these chars are all twinks, we all have 65 chars =p) would I still get the bonuses? IIRC I think I read somewhere that passive abilities work but triggered don't, but I wanted to be sure before I get a bunch of aa's and have them get wasted. I used search and couldn't find that topic so if someone knows the answer to this, could you please reply?</div></div><hr />

However I do not have first hand experience in this, so take it with a grain of salt.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, I'm pretty sure you keep the abilites. Back when PoP came out (or was it ldon?) and people pre-ordered, they got knocked back to level 50, and I'm pretty sure they kept their aa bonuses.</div></div><hr />

I know for certain that RUN3 works when you delevel below level 50.</div></div><hr />

Does this mean that getting weapon affinity 5 for a Ton Po's monk or duel weilding SoD monk would be useless? Thank you already for so much useful information.</div></div><hr />
