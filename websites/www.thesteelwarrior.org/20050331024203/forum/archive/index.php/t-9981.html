And atm whips doesnt work like normal, so i dont see any problem why they shouldnt fix it. Doesnt say they should put it higest on their list, but should try to fix it never the less.</div></div><hr />

Only in EQ ??<br />
Having a good lookin weapon  is like having a great looking guitar, it doesn t make you play better but it makes you feel special !<br />

<br />
so if this guy doesn't want his weapon to look like a freakin triangle, more power to him. fix the whip!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daemonwynd</div><div class="date">12-12-2004, 01:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">it's a simple fix, really.<br />
<br />
Hulcror's Whisker has a new whip grapic that looks much, MUCH better than the old graphic.<br />
<br />
Even if they don't modify it at all, changing it to that graphic would fix the problem.<br />
<br />
Because it's an easy fix, I don't think it's a big thing to ask, and don't see why some dev shouldn't take the 2 seconds to change it... it's probably a bug/mistake anyway, because if you think about it, if they are putting in new whip graphics into the game, why on earth would they purposely put a new weapon in with the old, crap graphic?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pumilio</div><div class="date">12-12-2004, 04:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd hardly call it bugged though.  <br />
<br />
&quot; the whip doesnt unfold much,&quot;<br />
<br />
Keyword much, this is similiar to the &quot;fd fails more then it used to, or SU isn't firing as often anymore, or insert complaint that's emotionally based&quot;<br />
<br />
Asking for it to be changed because there's something better looking out there or you don't feel it looks good enough and would be a simple fix is one thing.  saying &quot;omg this is bugged it needs fixed!&quot; gets you dismissed as a simpleton.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The problem here mr Pumilio, is that the whip and ALL other whips ARE bugged. Maybe take on your old silken whip of ensnaring and try, before bashing ? <br />
<br />
And just to clarify this, it has nothing to do with the graphic on the whip, it is just to fix the animation on it and all whips, which seems to atm be bugged.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Really? or you just don't think it's unfolding enough, because last raid I saw alot of ranger pet weapons unfold.<br />
<br />
Obviously there's a perception to it not unfolding enough.<br />
<br />
You do know it's kind of on a timer and things like procing (which has it's own animation) and other things, cause it to reset.<br />
<br />
-added-<br />
<br />
you said in your first statment not that it doesn't unfold (which would be bugged) but that it's just not doing it often enough.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, before whips used to fold on each hit, now they do not, sometimes they fold, but very often they dont, i have no idea the % of that tho, maybe unfold 20-30 % of the time.</div></div><hr />

Obviously we need to get someone to parse this, becuase this is really important to how the weapon performs!  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

165 work atk<br />
no Ferocity<br />
41 percent worn haste<br />
<br />
Bonecleaver unfolded a total of 0 (zero) times throughout the parse.  This may be a result of the parsing mob dying in 2:31:12 into the parse, resulting in an inconclusive outcome as just under three and a half hours of standing like a lump on a log does not belong in the test set.<br />
<br />
Will parse further when the mob respawns.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And found that in a 3minute interval, it unfolded 30times, but my last parses pre-broken animation showed it unfolding 45times, clearly I need a longer parse but the results will be similiar I bet showing that clearly it doesn't unfold as much as barbie lovers like.</div></div><hr />

It unfolds many a time, with 41% haste+Salik+Overhaste+Primary. I plan to get Thunderclap soonish, and will parse the rate at which both unfold!<br />

PATCH MESSAGE:<br />
<br />
a. Whip animations fixed! (Thanks to TSW community for pointing this out!)<br />
<br />
b. We had this great plan to fix class balance complaints but we were too busy working on whip animations so we just gave knights defensive instead.<br />

I assume the other guys have em on but I don't know.  AFAIK we don't have a specific rule on sig size, just try to use a little common sense.  If you do have an exceptionally large sig, try to only post it once per thread max.  Nobody likes scrolling past the same pic 5 times on one page, no matter how long it took you to make it in photoshop :).  Detheb's is pretty big, but at least it's not too tall.  Could be shrunk 40% or so without losing anything IMO though.</div></div><hr />

Just got my Thunderclap some days ago, and to my annoyance ive noticed that whips are at the moment bugged, the whip doesnt unfold much, and most of the time its like you hit with a snooker triangle  Talked to some others who had the same problem, kinda annoying and hope they fix it.<br />

Yes i know what  a rant is i have seen many in my day, but lil stuff like this gets under my skin and instead of saying something smartass to the post i simply said rants like this make baby jesus cry.. <br />
<br />
Understand now ??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maca</div><div class="date">12-24-2004, 10:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nice way to pull Thundersam to pieces there lads,but hey some of you got to make witty little comments so the next post would  be the usuall 'rolf this made my day !' or 'Sweet job'<br />
<br />
He never said it should be top of the fix list,its just annoying thats all,after playing EQ for 4 years or so i do give a shit what my char looks like,so do many others, i guess thats why AoN or Guise are so bloody popular.<br />
The whip is probably top weapon you Warriors go for  from OOW,so if its top end weapon of top end OOW why shouldnt it bloody work right. All this crap about ' if it was a smelly kipper id use as long as it makes mob hate me!' is bullshit.<br />
We all pay to play this game and when you log on every bloody night to raid when everyone else buggers off to WoW or some crap you expect the item you have just spent maybe 2 months saving for to look like the kickass weapon its stat show it to be.<br />
<br />
Its just pure laziness when small but annoying bugs like this arent fixed,but they waste time fixing doors in Freeport dont you agree ?<br />
<br />
Sai..</div></div><hr />
