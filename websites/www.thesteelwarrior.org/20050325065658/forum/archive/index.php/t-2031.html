<br />
1. Have all servers awoken The Sleeper now? (besides givens like stromm etc.)<br />
2. Anyone ever been close to this bad mofo? Heard he's got like 1.5 billion hp and insane regen.</div></div><hr />

2) no i doubt he has both but of course we have no proof i heard something about 2 guilds combining and taking him and one getting all banned or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerald</div><div class="date">07-18-2003, 12:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The whole sleeper thing is becoming a satire really... it's pretty silly.<br />
<br />
No one has ever killed him or ever came close to killing him. He really was an unkillable mob and he had about 1.7 billion hp if I remember correctly (the largest number allowed by that number type in programming). He DT'd every 30 seconds and hit pretty hard. Some people said he had weak AC and or MR.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NorokFV</div><div class="date">07-18-2003, 08:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">he's still sleeping on FV too</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Braeorn</div><div class="date">07-18-2003, 09:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wonder if some of the uber time guilds could combine to kill...might be possible. I remember when Lord British was 'unkillable' in Ultima.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solinar</div><div class="date">07-18-2003, 09:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe if somebody would just come up with a plan and organize it!!!  We could make an EQ first!!! I have a sleepers key, I would help, just name a place and a time to devote the 40+ hours of eatting DT every 30 seconds to beat him down and I am so there!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Braeorn</div><div class="date">07-18-2003, 11:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The more I think about it, the more possible it seems. With pumpers, rods, clickers, FT, C5, sowoods, qui's...a prolonged battle which obviously this would be seems more probable than ever before...not to mention the Time equipped guilds full of mini-gods.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solinar</div><div class="date">07-18-2003, 11:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lets say you could gather 100 of the top DPS people of your server together for this.<br />
<br />
Lets also say you could get 40 warriors together to tank (enough to rotate AE taunt for a Deathtouch every 30 seconds).<br />
<br />
Add in clerics debuffers etc.<br />
<br />
Your looking at 160 people which is insane lag.<br />
<br />
Now consider your top end DPS does 150 sustained DPS (including AFKs, etc) over a long long time.<br />
<br />
100 X 150 = 15,000 damage per second.<br />
<br />
2.1 billion hp / 15,000 hp per sec = 143,000 seconds = 40 hours.<br />
<br />
It will never possibly happen unless EQ characters get a 10-fold increase in DPS or more.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Braeorn</div><div class="date">07-18-2003, 11:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sol, the numbers are impressive (and overwhelming..ack)...but has anyone concrete knowledge of Sleeper's HP?<br />
<br />
I'm not trying to get flamed here, but I'm thinking that with Time being completed, maybe this will be an ideal target for guilds with nothing left to achieve.<br />
<br />
/shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">07-18-2003, 12:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The numbers are real. At one of the FFs s group of GMs chain DT'd the Sleeper and barely put a dent into him. There is no way in the world that the Sleeper is killable in its current state. Either his HP have to be decreased or raid DPS will have to go up an order of magnitude. Period. No amount of Time gear can change this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bombay</div><div class="date">07-18-2003, 12:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">sleeper was only recently awoken on xev.  there is some major backlash toward the guild that did it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Banuk</div><div class="date">07-18-2003, 12:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know 3-5 of the Elem Access guilds went to(2 from Nameless alone went) ...damn I cant remember the name! Sarym? whichever recent server where you could transfer and keep everything...?<br />
<br />
I would love to see the Ubers of their, Elem geared out the ass, etc, take on old kerafrym.....<br />
<br />
If it wouldn't be possibly for them, I don't see it ever happening...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NorokFV</div><div class="date">07-18-2003, 01:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i don't think it really matters if he's killable anymore since he's only sleeping on a handful of servers, and i'm fairly sure none of them would want to wake him just to try... considering it's really hard to tell if he even is killable in a reasonable amount of time due to his regen/hp. not to mention he does hit for quite a bit (2k or so?) and DTs so the chance of wiping is still rather high regardless of your gear, and you'd only get one shot... so it's just not really a feasible thing to do, ever. it's just the same old tired question that has came up every other day since velious... i really wish people would give it a rest :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

Nope, still have the original warders dropping SoD's, Shrouds of Longevity, and gnome masks on test.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daramin</div><div class="date">07-22-2003, 03:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You folks considering being able to kill Kerafym as he exists today on some servers are forgetting one minor point.<br />
<br />
It's not that he death touches. That'd make him tough. It's not that he has 2 billion HP's, that makes him nigh unto impossible.<br />
<br />
It's that he *zone-wide death touches*.<br />
<br />
That's right, AE death touch.<br />
<br />
You will never kill this mob the way he is today.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iskandar</div><div class="date">07-22-2003, 08:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's not a death touch. It's a very powerful AE, like 4k dmg. It's Kerafyrm's aggro range that's zonewide. His AE does have a long range for an AE but it's not nearly zonewide.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varf</div><div class="date">07-22-2003, 09:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i dont think he was ment to be killed, but i think it could be possable by some of the highest PoTime guilds,  how could an enslaved dragon who is the son on Vox and Naggy be maener then 4 gods put together?  i think he will fall into the storyline somewhere in the end of PoP (i dont belive its been beatin yet) or in a comming expantion.</div></div><hr />
