<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">07-08-2004, 03:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can start buying tribute effects at level 20, but I think you can look the effects at any level, whether you can actually use them yet or not.  The effects all have descriptions, so you can browse them and see their prices.<br />
<br />
Go to your home town (yes, it must be your original home town), hit Ctrl-F, choose the &quot;Tribute Master&quot;, follow the path to them, and right-click.  If the tribute master won't talk to you, then that means there's another Tribute Master in the same city that you should use instead.  (e.g. Kelethin has two Tribute Masters, but only one of them will work for each wood elf.)<br />
<br />
You need to donate money or tradeable items to the Tribute Master to get tribute points.  Turning on tribute effects uses up tribute points every 10 minutes.  Starting next patch, you'll be able to enable and disable the tribute effects whenever you want, so you won't have to drain points when you don't need the effects.</div></div><hr />

For example, pretty sure my guy started out just outside the West Gate in West Freeport, but Tribute Master is in by the bank.  <br />
<br />
But yeah, more or less in your hometown.</div></div><hr />
