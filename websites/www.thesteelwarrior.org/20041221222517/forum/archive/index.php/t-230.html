-15 ac<br />
+75 hp<br />
+8 sta<br />
+5 svm<br />
<br />
What's everyone think about this? I've heard some people who preach that anyone who uses it doesn't value ac as highly as they should, and some who say it's an awesome earring for it's value.<br />
<br />
I'm currently using one, but I have to know - how much does the ac hit matter?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomers</div><div class="date">04-23-2003, 09:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well the -15AC hit for a non-uber guilded warrior is a big one.  To see if it is going to be a big hit to your total AC remove one or more items of your armor and then calcualte the total loss of AC from the value of the armor you removed.  <br />
<br />
I like the lizard earring or Bloodmetal earring of engagement better</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gahid</div><div class="date">04-23-2003, 09:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Those both cost 60k+, and I don't have enough for even a Moisquito Leg Earring :( The total ac hit is 19 if I remember correctly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Surlok</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 11:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have one,and it is around 20 ac or so hit.The stamina only helps me when not buffed so it is just a hp earing with negative ac to me....<br />
<br />
Not really a big fan of it,however at 4k it'sfairly cheap,though I find with spending most of my time in velious and specifically ToV,that it is often bagged in favor of my Gobby earing for the debuff click..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 11:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Negative stats suck, especially a core warrior stat like AC.  That's just the way I look at it.  -20 ac for 75 hps is less than 4 hps/ac, screw that.  Even if you can use the STA it's not a great tradeoff IMO when there are a lot of 65+hp earrings out there.  Even compared to a 2/35 earring that is really cheap you're gaining less than 2 hps per ac lost.  <br />
<br />
Iron scream earring is a nice option as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nevian</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 01:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Always seemed like a paradox to me.  Most warriors who can afford to take a 20ac hit would have better anyways.  Personally its not worth it to me, i hate -stat items, probalby just a mental thing though =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gahid</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 03:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm, my AC is about 50 above 1300 buffed anyways...and I can't afford anything better =o<br />
<br />
Although I know 1300 AC is old school :)<br />
<br />
Maybe I should take it off....but for what?<br />
<br />
I'd have to find something for under 20k :/<br />
<br />
Screw it, just thinking about all that work buying/selling made me lazy...I'll just keep the Hammered Golden Hoop until something better drops :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solinar</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 03:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Run screaming away from this item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 05:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe, classic case of asking a question on a message board, getting an overwhelming answer, and then ignoring it and doing what you were going to do anyway.  Why bother asking?<br />
<br />
I'd wear an electrum black sapphire earring over that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ValyreSmoju</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 09:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Now that verant has removed the soft cap and the 50 ac *tiers* of ac, a negative 20 ac matters a lot more as each AC point is important, not just multiples of 50 (ie 1100, 1150, 1200).  Verant finally realized that common sense in the AC system would be a good idea, so now that item is potentially more negative that it would have been before this change was made. Id suggest against this earring...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grendonbb</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 11:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh, I'm glad this came up, because I never thought to ask, but judging by the overwhelmingly negative response from folks, I feel it is safe to assess that this item is not worth it.  Unfortunately... I bought it alreayd lol and have been wearing it for ages.<br />
<br />
I have Earring of The Solstice banked... would I be better off using it than Hammered Golden Hoop until I get a better upgrade?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbo Baggins</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 12:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">after PoP showing AC was still important i don't think i'd take the hit. get solistice and something else to go with it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
hp &gt; all <br />
<br />
This item looks very tastey for a split second, but don't be fooled. The negative AC is the suck. I too once thought of this as an uber earring, until my true friends showed me the light......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grendonbb</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 12:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Great, thanks for the advice guys!!!<br />
<br />
&lt;=== Not too stupid to take well-placed advice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 04:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Using the mitigation numbers from the tests on this board I got the approximation 1 AC = 5 HP with around 9K HP (buffed).  Even if you have say only half that, -15 AC will be like -37.5 HP so the earring is a 0 AC 37.5 HP earring, which is inferior to say the 2 AC 35 HP jewelcraft earrings.  Of course, more raw HP has other advantages but for tanking purposes, -15 AC puts you so much behind that the 75 HP gets offset considerably (and on the high end, it's like wearing nothing at all, or even worse!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tarsk</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 06:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think all of us Warriors have been at least tempted by this earring once in our lives *grins* .. I know I have, it's a quick easy way to get +100 HP on your ears, for anyone over about level 30.<br />
<br />
Like everyone else here though, after I calmed down and actually thought about the thing, I didn't buy it. I have a skeeter leg on one ear now and a yellow fang 30 AC monster on the other. I'm happy with my ears.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomb</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 07:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lol, I know i have been tempted by this one as well.<br />
I had a pearly sarnak bauble with 2 ac 10 sta 35 hp and some resists and thought about upgrading  due to coming close to stamina cap.<br />
But fortunately for me a highly polished gem in a pickup group (5 people from one guild and me as pickup P) in tactics dropped and i won it.<br />
Was one of the more memorable days as right after my chanter friend failed the combine for the bloodmetal earring of engagement the server crashed and right after he still had all components and i got lucky on second combine.</div></div><hr />

Drops off some purple-colored named netherbian swarmcaller thingy in the NW corner of Umbral Plains. Far as I know, he spawned somewhere in Tawro's caves, but I'm not sure - I wasn't the puller.<br />
<br />
As for the price, I don't know. I've never seen one for sale.</div></div><hr />

Try and hoist the hammered hoop on a rogue; it's not a bad earring for them, as STA and HP's are way more important to someone who is good at avoiding hits than AC is.<br />
<br />
For you, though, Mr. Tank, -15 raw AC sux.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 WHen people &quot;praised&quot; it was when AC was essentially pointless. I wore one for a long time myself. Even a month or two into PoP til I got a Bloodmetal Earring made.<br />
<br />
 If you don't hunt in PoP that much I'd say go with a Hoop/Loop. Otherwise yeah Solstice all the way. Did the &quot;quest&quot;, which involves running around the bazaar buying components, with my little SK. Cost me around 8-10k in the end with a guildmate giving me the robe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ThornyEQ</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 09:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">These days, on The Nameless, you can put a solstice earring quest together for around 5Kpp, definitely worth it for the money, plus let us not forget that always useful FT1 effect for us warriors! :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 10:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yellow Fang would be like 10 AC 100 HP if you convert 20 AC to HP (assuming 9K warrior) which would make it the best tradeable earring around.  I've seen those go for 40-60K range usually.  But the lack of any resists on that is somewhat troubling.<br />
<br />
Of course, the less HP you have, the less mileage you get out of AC as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spinetwist</div><div class="date">04-26-2003, 01:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dont forget the Solstice has resists!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaago</div><div class="date">04-26-2003, 08:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So what would be the best combo of earrings for a warrior?  Solstice and yellow fang or solstice and mosquitto leg?  Not that I can afford either of them, but it would be nice to know what I should work towards.  As soon as I get another 100pp I can get a second electrum black sapphire and that'll have to do until I can start doing some of the better money camps.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Robok</div><div class="date">04-26-2003, 12:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">-15ac sucks if your fighting in PoP or have under 1250ac.<br />
If your over 1250ac with the earring on and spending most of your time in SoL or SoV, you really wont notice much of a diffrence if any.<br />
<br />
I was never much of a beliver in the firm ac cap pre-PoP but i still used this earing once i got to a certin point.<br />
<br />
I would have to agree that the earring of soltice would be better, but you do have 2 ears. For a long time i used earring of the soltice and a hammered golden hoop.. once your fighting mainly in PoP tho, get rid of the HGH asap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Breogan</div><div class="date">04-26-2003, 04:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looking at your gear and what your guild is doing (NToV / Velious stuff) the earring is pretty good and doubt you will notice the AC hit. <br />
However having already another good earring (Bloodmetal) and the solstice, I'd go for the Bloodmetal + Solstice combo and sell the hoop (a combo that looks much better in my eyes :)).</div></div><hr />
