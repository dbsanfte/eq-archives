<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been told that my gear is pretty good for all non raid drops but I need better weapons. Anyone have any suggestions? I haven't been able to find any better aggro weapons that wont cost me a fortune like Blade of Carnage.<br />
<br />
Here is my magelo: http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=64921</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dibdab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">if you put the copper hammer in your off hand and use the long sword in your primary you might have some luck. but i can't really think of any weps that aren't supper exspensive that are better than those.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Wouldn't the loss of the proc make me have less aggro?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vilicontus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Both of your current weapons' procs have innate stun components to them, so I'm assuming your mention of loss of aggro is from the heated blade aug on your hammer.<br />
<br />
If I recall, DD procs don't do that much aggro. Aug procs at 305 dex run on 2 procs per min on either hand (hope I got this right lol  :p ), so offhanding the chos won't affect the aug's proc rate.<br />
<br />
If you really want to up your aggro without resorting to expensive weapons, get the Anger line augs from LDONs, or the Ykesha stun procs if you want a bit of DD to them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yea im working on the anger 3 augs, I should have 2 of them in about 3 or 4 more everfrosts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Cone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Anyone else have any other weapons they could suggest?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Anger III on the droga combo is about as good as it gets short of raid drops.  BoC and a few other droppable weapons are better, but not nearly enough of an increase to justify the cost jump.   If you wield an A3 aug'd droga combo and you can't hold aggro off someone they're either an idiot, an ass, or both.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Cone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yea, I hold aggro well without the augs so I imagine with them it should be np. Was just wondering if there were any weapons I wasnt aware of. Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Buyable you have about the best combo available without splashing out the big $$ for a BoC or SoD.<br />
<br />
If you can muster a couple of groups together you might be able to score a Great Blade of Storms from a BoT tower raid, or possibly a CHSD if you can take down Xanamech</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yeh, you have great weapons relative to your gear level.I wouldn't worry.I preferred the CHOS in mainhand over the SOTB /shrug.Aggro augs are the next step.Just decide if a BOC and nodrop weapons are too far away to hold the aug points for.</div></div><hr />
