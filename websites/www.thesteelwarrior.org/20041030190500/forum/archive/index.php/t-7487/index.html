<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fuzzee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Alright, here's the deal. I'm poor. I'm guildless. I haven't really had time to exp/LDoN for a while until this summer.  I group with personal friends that consist of a 58+shaman, 65 Time cleric with endless mana regen/pool, and 65 epiced zerker.  Basically I'm looking for advice on what to camp (besides doing lots of LDoN's).<br />
<br />
Keep in mind I have 2k so amy' masks and BoC's not really options.<br />
Also guildless though hopefully I may be joining a Time+ guild soon. <br />
<br />
See magelo on the left.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Get your group tactics flagged and camp there. Fewer people than BoT, so lots lets competition. <br />
<br />
Look for your servers open raid org and get flagged on that when your friends arent around. Wait on buying anything from LDoN other htan anger augs (to see what the new top levle armor is, where it is and if they will really let us move augs).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Daabu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Feet -- LDoN drops are your best bet here.  The Everfrost hard boots are 34ac 85hp and somewhat common.<br />
<br />
Legs -- Best you can get, really, is the ornate legs.  Till then, you're good.<br />
<br />
Wrists -- you have a few options.  If you can get a few friends, you could look at the Ring of Slime event in Cazic Thule.  Theres a 100hp war-only bracer that drops from there, and is by todays standards single groupable.  Ornate wrists are easily campable in tactics or BoT.  You could also hit up Velk's for a silver chitin wrist, 15ac 40hp.  Theres also the rock-molded wristguard from Chardokb, with 30ac 25hp (hp is low, but the AC is pretty nice)<br />
<br />
Arms -- try to get yourself some Ornate.  Alternatively, theres a set of arms that drop in Riwwi that are quite nice, but the name escapes me.  I'm not sure if you and your friends are capable of Riwwi, I've never exp'ed there myself.<br />
<br />
In general, if you can find someone else to tank for you, or if you are confident of your healer (like it sounds you are), you could try some hard LDoN for some loot upgrades.  There's a 75hp 28ac plate bracer, a 100hp ring, an 85hp necklace, and a 90hp earring (not to mention the boots and the gloves you're wearing).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nilana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">May want to look into some quests.<br />
Strength of the Elements- 100hp shoulder item<br />
Dain Ring- 100hp ring (still have on my magelo if you want to look at the other stats)<br />
Spirit Wracked Cord- shoulder,arm,wrist slot - 100hp. You also get a 85hp ring from the quest. (also still using, if you want the addt stats)<br />
<br />
I think all of these would be worth your time if you are willing to put the time into them.<br />
You can find good walk throughs on Alla if you look for them.</div></div><hr />
