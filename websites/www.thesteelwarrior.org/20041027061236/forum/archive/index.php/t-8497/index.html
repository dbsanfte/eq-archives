<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Venz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Looking for a few suggestions for a duo spot for a 58 warrior and 61 cleric. We've been doing os to this point but exp has slowed down a lot. I know good exp is probably hard to find with a duo, but im looking for anything decent. I have roughly 6k hps with virtue and focus...not sure if my magelo link is working. thanks ;)</div></div><hr />

A decent yet quick to get boring spot for you two would be just outside the jail in Plane of Justice. There are 4 mobs that spawn in this area, about level 50-52. Your cleric will have no problems keeping you healed and could even bust out the spammer hammer to help some. The mobs don't run when low on hp and they drop decent cash loot at times. <br />
<br />
The four mobs I am talking about are the first KOS mobs you will come to when entering the jail area. Just past the high guardians. The first one is a rock creature, then there will be two Punisher's that will need to be split with the clerics Pacify spell. Once spawn is broken you are home free. About the time you get all four dead, you will have a minute or two to rest, then respawns will happen.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Venz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">ill check those out tonight...thanks all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Redleaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You could reallyl have fun in Seb or even Howling Stones.  While they both are really old school, HS is a good place for xp.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Chardok entrance and exit are decent too for pre-60; that is if you don't need faction.<br />
let the cleric pull ( 60+ you can single pull ) and the mobs are pus*ies. <br />
with my old Trunch of Doom I could solo down to the lower safe room ( via tunnel ) with Myrmidon gear only+epics. Entance/Exit are a cakewalk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Seb is annoying for war/cleric thanks to the sow'd runners.  Snare proc weapons are a pain.  If you have a trunch of doom give the Mavuin hall in Justice a try.  The lower level pacify works there, nothing runs, and you can make good money from gems and ethereal drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Venz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">we've started going to the lower jail part in PoJ, the area across from the basement. Higher up, things were blue to me and light blue to her...but down there it's all blue for both of us. We took a room with 3 spawns and between room spawns we pull pestilence rats. Pretty decent exp but no loot to speak of lol.</div></div><hr />
