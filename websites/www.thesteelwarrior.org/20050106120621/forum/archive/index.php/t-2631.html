Looking to upgrade in several areas.  The necklace is good fer haste but thats it, so I'd like to swap that out and gain some haste elsewhere if I can.  With the ClockWork Vambraces adn teh necklace I'm at 60% haste.  Need to find a good helm.  <br />
<br />
I can spend about 15k, and can save up fer more if need be.  Any and all recomendations welcome! <br />
<br />
Thanks much!</div></div><hr />

It is pretty cheap in the bazaar as well. As for haste, your sitting at 21% perm haste, so that should be fine for now. If you go to upgrade that again, it might go on up to about 15k or more for 27% haste, and more expensive for more haste.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">08-20-2003, 04:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The first question you need to ask yourself is do you plan on playing your warrior to the high end?  It's a tough question.  Do you really enjoy your warrior?  Do any other classes abilities have somewhat of an interest to you?  The reason I ask these questions is because equipping any warrior from the bazaar can be downright insanely expensive.  If you spend the time to gear up your warrior to a respectable level and decide to play another class, then you may find yourself wishing you had never done so because you will most likely end up losing a lot of money.<br />
<br />
Let's face it, equipping a warrior is a lot of work.  Groups won't want you if you can't hold agro or die within seconds of engagement.  In order to gear up properly, however, one must fight those same mobs and sell their fare share of the droppings in order to afford gear so they can tank them properly.  As you can see, it's a neverending downward spiral, I'll give you that.<br />
<br />
The payoff comes when your guild or your group wants YOU to tank that 900dps mob who would splatter your entire raid party if it weren't for you.  So all that hard work, blood, and sweat for a mere two minutes of being the living shit beat out of?  You betcha!  That's the warrior spirit.<br />
<br />
Anyhoo, before I ramble on ALL BLOODY DAY long, let's cut to the chase and discuss viable gear upgrades.<br />
<br />
As a fellow Brell worshiper, I would advise you to steer in that direction for some hearty and inexpensive gear upgrades.  While Underfoot gear has approximetly half the HP value as its Fierce Heraldic (Rallos Zek) cousin, as it was made in mind for Paladins as well, the AC is exactly the same.  Underfoot Platemail Greaves (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=12522) should run you ~14-18k depending on server, availability, and good nature of the smith who makes them.  They are just as good as Skyshrine quest greaves, so you can buy them in hopes to still be using them until Ornate gear becomes more readily available.  The Underfoot Platemail Breastplate (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=12192) is also an excellent investment for its high amounts of AC.  It will serve you very well until you can get your hands on a Vindi BP.  I would also suggest looking into two Underfoot Platemail Bracers (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=12194).  Although you won't gain the full effect of those items until level 45, that level is really not all that far off.  It's quite easy to hit 50 these days.  <br />
<br />
I would recommend more, but those four items should keep you busy for some time.  In the meantime, good luck and may Brell be with you!</div></div><hr />

Click on my magelo on the left to see how I have equiped my little tank.<br />
<br />
As for weapons, I think the centi and wurmy will suit you pretty well for another 10 to 15 levels when the damage bonus from faster weapons starts to add up a little more.</div></div><hr />
