<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've read and posted about Warrior/Paladin balance for awhile. Recently I've seen a concerted effort to exagerate Warrior advantages and to downplay Paladin's.<br />
<br />
With the effect of vastly superior Paladin aggro control having been widely acknowledged, it was suggested that this was fair since Warriors have an HP advantage. So we debunked the myth that Warriors have an intrinsic 800HP advantage.<br />
<br />
Then attention was shifted to mitigation and DPS. These areas have been pretty throughly examined and seem to be in line with expectations. Now some Paladins have taken up the cry that their buffs are are useless.<br />
<br />
So, here's how Paladin AC and HP buffs stack up:<br />
<br />
Paladin<br />
Bulwark of Faith - 37AC<br />
Brell's Stalwart Shield - 330HP<br />
Heroic Bond - 19AC 425HP<br />
Symbol of Marzin - 700HP<br />
--Total-- 56AC 1455HP<br />
<br />
Cleric<br />
Hand of Virtue - 72AC 1500HP<br />
--Total-- 72AC 1500HP<br />
<br />
Is it any wonder that in experiance groups without a Cleric as a healer Paladins would be prefered to Warriors? In such groups Paladins can have practically the same HP's as a Warrior, excellent mitigation, unsurpassed aggro control, can buff the group nearly as well as a Cleric, and still have a few utility spells to contribute like spot heals, groups heals, Root, stuns, GRC, and Res.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It is true what you say about buffs but this is an &quot;on paper&quot; assessment which isn't quite accurate of how things are &quot;in game&quot;.<br />
<br />
Hero + Bulwark + Marzin = Aego.  No shock here.  The trick is there is always seems to be Druids hanging around.  There goes Hero.  There always seems to be Clerics hanging around too.  There goes Marzin.  Rarely people ask for the straight AC buff from either me or the Cleric.<br />
<br />
It should also be mentioned that only Brells and Heroic Bond are Group V2.  Buffing an entire group is somewhat costly.<br />
<br />
In any event I make it no secret I carry around peridots for symbols.  If there is no Cleric around I gladly pass out symbols.  The reality is that it is more of an exception than the rule.  While arranging an adventure at an LDoN camp, for instance, its easy enough to pester a fellow guildy for buffs.<br />
<br />
I'm glad I have them but the reality is that they aren't that useful.  I get way more milage out of my cures than my buffs (except for the Brell Line).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The only thing that's academic about this argument is paladins' continuing dismissal of their buffs' worth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Slight correction on your numbers...Hand of Virtue is only 1405hp, not 1500.  Using the individual buffs, clerics can buff 1430hp, but we can't break 1500hp in buffs except on ourselves (with self buff).  Now look at the numbers again and you'll see something a number of Clerics have been a small bit pissed off at for a while.<br />
<br />
Also, you need to make sure you state that's at level 65.  Heroism isn't 425hp until you reach 65.  It's 400 at 60.  Not a huge deal, considering Marzin for paladins isn't until 63, but I'm being nitpicky.<br />
<br />
I've already said my piece on the buff situation (as well as paladins downplaying their abilities) almost countless times, so people know my opinion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When a Cleric is not in your group, his buffs are not sorely missed if you have a Paladin. It couldn't be any clearer than that.<br />

 The reality is that it is more of an exception than the rule.  <br />
  <br />
<br />
Isn't that  like saying picking a warrior over an equivalent paladin is more the exception than the rule?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Boleslav</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Battleblade makes the initial post like he just now realized it.  However, I have seen him trot this argument out several times before in the past.  Just feel like stirring the pot some more by re-hashing this tired argument?<br />
<br />
Yes, Paladins get second string Cleric buffs.  Yes, in the absence of a Cleric they are quite powerful.  Yes, the real possibility that a Paladin might have more HP than an equally-equipped Warrior in some group situations is a legitimate balance concern.  <br />
<br />
However, that does not mean that the spells are being used a lot.  I appreciate the fact that I have considerable HP buffs.  But my experience with them is much like Aeka's.  I cast Brell's all the time, and it usually is kept by about half the folks I group with.  I occasionally cast Symbol, when there is no Cleric available to add Kazad.  I rarely cast Heroism and I almost never cast Bulwark of Faith.  So while the buffs are powerful, they are not much of a factor for my everyday gameplay.  I cannot think of a group I have gotten recently that I would not have gotten without the ability to cast any of those buffs.<br />
<br />
Also… Yes, including Brell's a Paladin can buff for more total HP than a Cleric.  The only time is likely to happen is in a group with a Shaman as main healer.  While Shaman are capable of being main healer in some situations, it's not horribly common.  Most Shaman I know get plenty of groups with their other capabilities and I don't see them lining up to be main healer.  In other situations, the Paladin is likely to add Symbol to a Druid's Nine, and of course to cast Brell's on whoever wants it.<br />
<br />
So I have to sort of take both positions here.  Paladin HP buffs are good.  However, outside of Brell's and the occasional Symbol, I don't cast them very often at all so they don't affect my groupability.  Again, I admit that the fact that a Paladin can have more HP than an equally equipped Warrior in some valid group situations is a fair concern.  <br />
<br />
I kind of liked Battleblade's &quot;War Paint&quot; idea he posted a while back.  The War Paint would be a vendor purchasable Warrior only self buff of sorts that didn't stack with other buffs.  This would help Warriors in those situations where the normal run of buffs was unavailable to help make them a bit more competitive in those situations.  I was disappointed that the idea didn't get discussed much.<br />

Another Paladin (in which case why not get a warrior and have him tank using the pally buffs?)  Necro/Ranger/Beastlord, in which case you have a real nonstandard group and are probably not doing serious tanking anyway?<br />
<br />
Or did you mean to say, &quot;in a group with only a shaman healer,&quot; paladins can buff almost as well as a cleric?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Newsflash: <br />
<br />
 In groups, Druids make acceptable healers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Warrior would be entirely missing cleric buffs and Brells unless he purchased them in advance. The Paladin is not only assured of having cleric buffs, but can also buff the rest of the group.<br />
<br />
While this might look like stirring the pot to some, it was as I stated a responce to Paladins downplaying their assets in the larger class balance debate.<br />
<br />
In experiance groups, Paladins do have assets which allows them to have preference in a wider variety of groups in addition to their widely recognized aggro superiority.<br />
<br />
Effectiveness against undead, the ability to buff, CC, and aggro superiority, with no real downside is quite a list of advantages in experiance groups. What exactly do Warriors get that balances this?<br />
<br />
Real class balance would require that these things are taken into account when adjusting Warriors. I believe some Paladin's are downplaying their advantages because they are intoxicated by their effectiveness vs. Warriors in experiance groups and want to preserve it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ezedriel7th Ham</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">In response to those paladins who say that our buffs are useless...<br />
<br />
which bodily orifice is this being plucked up from?  I can name one, just one buff that I see requested on raids time and time and time again without ever missing a beat.<br />
<br />
Brell's.  Who doesn't want Brell's?  Why wouldn't someone want Brell's?  Useless?  No, it adds that many more hit points onto the already large stacks of hit points being piled onto the main tank (be it warrior, paladin or shadow knight) and it is requested.<br />
<br />
While our other buffs are rarely, if ever, requested...they are used and I cast them quite frequently in my exp groups.  Allow me to offer you a situation.<br />
<br />
If I am grouped in say...let's throw in a random plane here a moment...Valor, and the group decided to bring a druid along as the main healer, I'm not getting virtue or any other clerical buffs.<br />
<br />
I'm going to get let's say hypothetically, Protection of the Nine.<br />
<br />
That still leaves room for at the very least symbol + brell's + any other buff slots I still have open + whatever else the shaman decides to throw on me.<br />
<br />
I'm using my buffs, plus there's the little dark and hidden secret that so many paladins try to keep under the rug.<br />
<br />
http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=3247&amp;source=Test<br />
<br />
Stacks with what...every buff in the game?  That's an extra 350 HPs that are exclusive to the paladin + mana regen.  That's not a little deal we're talking about there, that's a large increase in power coupled in with the others.<br />
<br />
I use my paladin buffs regularly.  I use them when I solo, I use them when I group when a cleric is not on hand, and I almost ALWAYS use Brell's even with a cleric on hand.<br />
<br />
Allow me to illustrate something for the paladins here that don't believe pally buffs mean anything:<br />
<br />
You state that utilities are never taken into consideration when you're brought into a group.  This is false.  You know it, I know it, so please cut that arguement right now.<br />
<br />
When looking between a paladin and a warrior to main tank in an exp group (where most of the imbalance is seen at the moment) they're going to look at ALL the possibilities involved and entailed.<br />
<br />
Possibility number one: The paladin can hold aggro better than a warrior.  This is something that is considered first and foremost prior to any other thing that they consider between a paladin and a warrior.  That paladin can have a slow land on incoming, can let the caster over nuke, and can let the cleric heal as often as he/she wants.<br />
<br />
Possibility number two:  What brings the most to the group?  The paladin brings moderate (nothing fancy but moderate) DPS, aggro lock, group heals,  an extra 330 hit points for all, lay hands, spam heals, emergancy heals, root for emergancy crowd control, stun to interrupt casting.  The warrior brings about two to six hundred more HPs and some DPS maybe a bit better mitigation.  Which would you pick?<br />
<br />
Possibility number three: Who can make my job easier?  The paladin makes everyone's job easier, saving the cleric on down time heals, saving the cleric from having to heal anyone else, allowing the cleric to use DArb at whim without risk, and makes it so the cleric practically has to heal no one but the paladin.  If anyone else gets hit a Touch of Nife and/or a group heal or two should remedy that.<br />
<br />
Possibility number four: What speeds up the rate of exp?  Certainly not the warrior with his bind wound, decent DPS, and lack of firm aggro lock.  In Planes of Power the itemization has thrown the whole reason warriors were superior out of whack with the narrowing of the gap between warrior and paladin AC/HP.  In Velious/ Kunark, warriors were &quot;it&quot; because they could take the hits and give them back long enough for the clerics to land their heals.  It was very simple...the paladin couldn't.  It wasn't mana efficient in raid situations.  Now adays the paladin tanks like a warrior, has aggro lock like a paladin, and heals just short of a cleric.  Not only does this speed up the rate of pulls, but the paladin's lack of DPS is made up for by the group's DPS increase.  The paladin beefs up the abilities of the group to their maximum, the warrior hinders them.<br />
<br />
Now before you start trying to pull out the Kunark wild card, put it back down.  We suffered during mid to maybe late Kunark because a ranger tanked better than us.  Guess what, we got fixed, it's over, and it wasnt' even that long of a traumatic experience, if you can call it traumatic at all.<br />
<br />
We had some problems...they were ironed out and by Velious and more or less the end of Kunark we were fine.  By Shadows of Luclin we found ourselves getting over powered and now...welcome to Planes of Power.<br />
<br />
And yet the most surprising thing is that paladins go &quot;Oh I want a fix&quot; and yet they only want a fix that won't let warriors touch any bit of their former &quot;greatness&quot;.  Warriors were great in Velious...I consider that expansion the golden age of Everquest.  Class balance was the best I'd ever seen (with the exception of toward the end when monks needed their mitigation nerf) and why that kind of role wasn't kept for paladins and shadow knights is beyond me.<br />
<br />
But this whole thing of trying desperately to grasp onto the straws of our overpoweredness is as logical as it is fair.  We need to be simmered down, warriors need to be boosted, their taunt needs to be more reliable when this entire expansion is based around firm aggro (per se), and we need to be more willing to help them with that.<br />
<br />
And this BS of &quot;Our buffs are worthless&quot; needs to come to a close.<br />
<br />
If you loathe your buffs so much, /feedback and post on the boards about getting them sent to warriors, I'm sure they'd appreciate them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually I have seen situations where using a Druid/shaman healing that the group looked for a Paladin to fill the last spot (for res and cleric-lite buffs).  Not the norm I'd imagine though.<br />
<br />
As for the effectiveness of Paladin spells; in a recent group we had our 2 boxing cleric/rogue go LD 1 min into an adventure.  With the remaining force of warr/pallie/bard/wiz (all friends so we said what the hay) we came within a whisker on finishing a collection LDoN (if pallie had kept KEI we woulda made it).  There is alot more utility than you might think with Pallie spells.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The in game reality is that all of the buffs I've inherrited from Clerics never stack with Clerics and awkwardly stack with Druids.  So what are we comparing?  Buffs that are hard to use against buffs that everyone would use (Virtue or Nine + Kazad)?<br />
<br />
Yes these buffs are useful but wow they aren't that useful.  As I said, I get more usage out my cures.  I applaud anyone calling the bluff of those who say buffs are useless.  But they aren't that useful either.</div></div><hr />

Thank you for your post Ezedriel, it's nice to be reminded that not all Paladins are whiny protectionists of their current gross superiority. My appreciation isn't solely 'cause you agree with us, honest :D.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Aeka is right, I do use the buffs very rarely, they arnt without merit or use, but because of the EASE of getting SUPERIOR buffs (Except for BSS line) makes them signicently LESS useful then they appear to be, With MGB Virtues, Kazads, and Nines in PoK being common, people botting people for buffs, guildies, friendly people, centralizied locations  etc etc (Wayfarer camps) it is the exception, not the rule they are used.<br />
<br />
Res on the other hand is pretty useful espcially in LDoN and is factor that is actively considered in Non cleric groups,</div></div><hr />

<br />
who is saying paladin buffs are useless? Most of the paladins here are just trying to say that we dont use Heroic bond, and our symbols are only used if clerics are not around (that possible?). Can you be honest and say that you had heroic bond on in an adventure?  K, maybe you did, but not all of us are so beefy in Hit points like you are and we will go out of our way for a virtue.  Even then not all of us carry peridots like we're clerics or something.  Im one of those type paladins who really wish that paladin aego never came out, and it wasnt even needed. While BSS adds 330hp to you, the rogues, rangers, monks, beastlords, SKs, some paladins, and even some warriors would rather have ranger buffs.  In an xp group we all know that the goal is to kill fast, you dont get that with 330hp buff.  You'll require less heals if your group has higher attack buffs as the mob is killed faster.<br />
<br />
fyi almost every class who can cast has a self only unique buff, its not hidden, we all know, unless its new to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Yes Valeris you caught me.  Its really isn't true that most Paladin buffs over overridden by better Cleric versions.  Its a compete crock of crap that Druid's Nine line has better components than the Cleric Hero Line.<br />
<br />
I guess I am lying to all of you because reality is you can never find a Cleric or a Druid willing to buff you either.  Its nearly impossible to find one hanging around at a WFC or in Knowledge/Tranquility.<br />

Paladins all over are reporting how its a rotten spell because there is no use for it except in the rare case you decide to go soloing in places like Western Wastes.  It is clearly a big fib.<br />
<br />
We all must be BSing you guys.  You are completely right in your assement that Hero + Bulwark + Marzin &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Virtue.  Go forth and spread the gospel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I think the differing view points here comes from how Aeka clearly plays a game where she is never more than 5 mins from PoK for a rebuff and always has a cleric as main healer anyway.<br />
<br />
Sorry, but you dont have to be in WW for it to be difficult for you to get to PoK to buy a virtue, and there are plenty of groups where cleric buffs arent available and even a few where neither cleric nor druid buffs are available.<br />
<br />
Maybe life is so good for paladins these days that you can turn those groups down<br />
<br />
Aeka tells you: &quot;Sorry, but you dont have a cleric and you are camping too far away from the zone line for me to run and get a Virtue if I die&quot;<br />
<br />
There are situations where a Paladin's buffs will give them more HPs than an equally equiped warrior in the same group.  This makes warriors HP advantage only an advantage situationally in XP groups.  Sure no one will ever ask you for HB or Symbol or your AC buff while on a raid or in a group with a cleric, but unless you avoid all groups that don't adhere to your ideal perfect group for risk free XP and EQ monotony that is apparently the ideal EQ experience for you Aeka, these spells are not worthless, infact they can be pretty damn useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Hero + Bulwark + Marzin &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Virtue When the cleric is a figment of your fevered mind &amp; you only have access to PoT9 it is. Your example appears to be that because you might run to PoK and take a chance that someones buffing Virtue right at the right moment and/or because you might have got a MGB in the last few minutes so the buff isn't half done with, then therefore the advantage is negligable, God forbid that you actually die and require party buffs as Eoden points out. That strange excuse for an arguement is most definately a crock of shit and typical of your double talking ways. May i also point out at this moment that AoTC stacks with virtue?<br />
<br />
I beg to differ that everyone runs around in this game fully raid buffed and with buff bots hanging around waiting to please - ignoring that convenient generalisation the different means whereby you can mix and stack buffs to suit your groups buffing capability and also boost your group members is very useful no? no of course it isn't. <br />
<br />
When considering a choice between a warrior and a Paladin, potential extra hp's for the entire group from your buffs and your own ability to halve or in some cases even virtually eliminate the warrior hp advantage (our big selling point apparently) whilst retaining all your other advantages is, of course, utterly immaterial. Pheh, sure. :rolleyes:<br />

I agree warriors are a broken class who have seen nearly every class but them being upgraded to fit new expansions.  Warriors should be the master of tanking, especially big raid mobs, like Quarm.<br />
<br />
But yet, after coming here I have noticed that many of you are infact the whiniest bitches I have ever seen.  <br />
<br />
From posts you guys make, to me it sounds like you won't be happy until knights can't cast spells at all (mainly paladins whom you seem to have some fixation on for whatever reason).  <br />
<br />
Some of you won't be happy until you're the only tank class period.  In that nobody else even has a remote chance to tank a mob.<br />
<br />
I have even seen some of you bash people who come here to support you...some class you have.  <br />
<br />
Oh and to stay more in topic of this thread.  90% of the groups I seem to find usually prefer to wait on a cleric over any other healing class (although ldon has changed that somewhat).  Having a cleric does infact make a paladin buffs (except BSS completely worthless)  I have played a friends paladin off and on for awhile, and I would say for all but mabye 10 spells, they are for situational use only and mabye used once a month.</div></div><hr />

How is this not a balance issue?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Beats me....I wonder that why you guys believe it is even on the radar for balancing.<br />
<br />
One of the worst melee and spell damage dealing classes in the game getting extra HP?  Yes...a very huge tradgedy.  A rare, expensive buff combination tradgedy.  A keeping the Warriors down by 230 HP tradgedy.  Ignoring that I would rather have more mana regen tragedy (but hey that is my humble opinion).  I can now see how Aura of the Crusader is such an evil spell.<br />
<br />
So is this a 230 HP mountain or molehill?  If anyone believes 230 HP will make or break tanking then they really don't understand the big problems with melee tanking.  Or buff stacking for that matter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Shadowfrost</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Eh, nobody was talking about AotC.  We were talking about HB+BoF+Marzin+BSS.<br />
<br />
We obviously have different definitions of &quot;rare, expensive buff.&quot;  To me, a &quot;rare, expensive buff&quot; is DI, which isn't easy to get in the first place, requires 12aa spending on that specific spell before it becomes useful, and takes two emeralds for a 5 minute base duration.  HB+BoF+Marzin+BSS is an exp group combination, and it's neither rare nor expensive.<br />
<br />
You out-tank one of your parent classes and out-buff the other, but you're not sure why that's&quot;even on the radar&quot; for class balancing?<br />
<br />
And yes, breaking news, even if we WERE including AotC in this, 230hp does, in fact, matter.  I challenge you to look at the amount of sheer effort a warrior would go through to get an extra 230hp and tell me it doesn't matter with a straight face.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Any buff but Aura a Warrior can get as well.  Where is the inequallity?  How about this: If I buff every Warrior I come across in Tranquility with Hero + Bulwark + Marzin + BSS, how much of that will actually stick?  Only the BSS.   An even better question: will the Warrior appreciate getting Hero Bulwark and Mirzin?  Probably not.<br />
<br />
The only time I pull out Hero and Bulwark is when I end up soloing (farming tradeskill stuff is so fun anyway).  I use Marzin on the off occation the group doesn't have a Cleric.<br />
<br />
I am happy I have them but they don't make a difference in the long run.  Real behavior changing spells are heals and cures.  These spells alter strategies and change the fundementals of how one plays.  Hero, Bulwark, Marzin and even Brells do not.  Buffs are psuedo interesting that way.<br />
<br />
Buffs for you are the same buffs for me.  Am I going to decline Nine or Virtue because I can buff myself?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Voridor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Like I said, you won't be happy until knights can't cast spells at all.  You picked a warrior full knowing they don't have spells and never would.  <br />
<br />
The only legit argument from spells I can see you throwing up about class balance between paladins mainly and warriors is the aggro gained from stuns and group heals.  Aotc somewhat, but most casting classes have their own self hp buff, so to rid of one almost calls for removal of all. <br />
<br />
I've never gotten a group because people wanted paladin buffs.  More like, I was in a group and the make up resulted in no cleric, and then people reluctantly took mine over trying to find a cleric to virtue us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Thaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Voridor, you ever group with a warrior who actually did the tanking? Wanna know why you were there? Because of your buffs (I guess the heals wouldn't be so bad, either O_O).<br />
<br />
Seems to me that paladins can out-buff clerics (not getting the exact numbers out, but whatever). Do you think this is right? Sure, it may be expensive, but hey, you knew full well that some buffs require reagents.<br />
<br />
And we've all seen the warrior stand-point for paladins.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Voridor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">My point is, very rarely are we even asked to buff our groups from my experience.  People dont say screw a cleric, lets just find a paladin to buff us, they are better anyway.  We are a last resort when no clerics are around.<br />
<br />
I mostly hunt in elemental now so I could just be out of the times of LDoN (quit that after a week) and I can see how paladin buffs could be interchangable in there.  But on the whole, rarely, rarely do my buffs come into play unless im dueling, soloing, or rare times without a cleric.  And I havent soloed with the paladin since level 60 really other than trying to farm VT shards.<br />
<br />
And not trying to rip on paladin buffs cause I really do like having them as a back up...just stating they probably arent used as much as some would think.  Also another reason cleric buffs preferred over paladins (not dealing with cost factor) is due to duration.  Virtue lasts 2 and half hours roughly, while paladin symbol is an hour.  <br />
<br />
and yes, I have grouped with warriors many times, but I only group with guildies anymore so not sure they really just picked me for one reason or other...its just that I happend to be lfg and they had a spot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Tell you what: you can have the HP difference if Paladins get a 3 mana regeneration buff.  I can't figure out how this &quot;bonus&quot; helps out.  I can't figure out how 230 non-scaling HP is some big bonus.  Can you tell me what new levels of uber tanking I can do with this &quot;massive&quot; bonus?  If any one really believes this difference will make much of a difference then you see tanking differently than I do.<br />
<br />
Guidance/Hero, Bulwark, Marzin are weak buffs anyday often used in stopgap situations.  If you had these buffs on are you going to stick with them or suggest going to find at least a Druid or at most a Cleric for better buffs?<br />
<br />
Are you sure you guys are comparing apples to apples?  Some how Paladin self buffing is causing all sorts of problems for Warriors I've never heard when all indications show that its rarely used.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">I can understand why many of a Paladin's buffs are rarely used - But used they are and that makes them a value.<br />
<br />
Anyways, Brells + Aura of Crusader is roughly equal to the Warriors supposed edge in hitpoints. Also, considering that the best breastplate in the game for a warrior only adds 250 HP, then yes ... a 330 HP buff that stacks with everything is quite a bit of a thing.<br />
<br />
Anyways, this whole thing is eroding.<br />
<br />
The main point of the thread is : Your spellbook is worth a lot.<br />
And if your spell book is worth alot it must be considered in the overall Balance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Aeka, you're missing the point.  The original point of discussion is the fact that knights downplay the usefulness of their spells, and hype the &quot;Warrior HP advantage&quot; whenever discussing balance.  You are right, the extra 230 HPs you're talking about are meaningless.  But in anything other than normal LDoN, the 500hps (maybe less) that a similarly geared warrior will have over you assuming cleric buffs is just as meaningless.  Sort of brings us back to the fact that you can do everything I can do, plus cast your spells.  Oh, and this &quot;Any buff but Aura a Warrior can get as well&quot;  is bullshit.  I'll consider it a relevant point when I can cast those buffs on myself.  If I'm grouped with a shammy/druid team for healing and buffing (which has happened as recently as last night 'cause no clerics were around)  I get what I get from them.  There's not always a cleric around when you need one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Aldarion_Shard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">You out-tank one of your parent classes and out-buff the other<br />
<br />
well, technically paladins out tank both of their parent classes, and out buff both of them as well.  nitpicking, I know, but it illustrates the inherant imbalance a little better to state it that way.<br />
<br />
In genetics we call this phenomenon &quot;overdominance&quot; or &quot;heterosis&quot; or &quot;hybrid vigor&quot;.<br />
<br />
In MMORPGs its called game breaking class imbalance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Marrgill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Not to be too nitpicky, but you shouldn't say knights when you mean paladins.  Obviously, shadow knights don't have any of the cleric buffs that warriors are complaining in this thread about paladins having.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">True that .... on the other hand Warriors cannot Snare and Feign Death either.<br />
<br />
An SK's spellbook is still worth a lot and should be considered in the overall balance.<br />
After all, if it isn't, SK's would end up with having spells removed and become pure Melee, I'm pretty sure that's not what they want either.<br />
<br />
If you lower the worth of one part of a Hybrid, the other must go up. Otherwise they'll be internally unbalanced. So if you ignore one part entirely, the other will go up so far it enroaches heavily on their parent classes.<br />
<br />
 - Ignore spells = screw the pure melee parent class<br />
 - Ignore the Melee = screw the caster parent classes.<br />
<br />
Right now Knights have become better Tanks than their Melee parent class - Warriors - But their Parent Caster Class is still in good conditions.<br />
<br />
Rangers don't seem to hurt either of their parent classes (Warriors and Druid) and also seem fairly balanced, except Melee weapons, but that's a trivial thing to fix.<br />
<br />
Beastlords have indeed impeded some on their Monken parent Class, at least when it comes to Tanking ability.<br />
<br />
Bards ... are just Bards - Nothing to compare with there.<br />
Not really quite balanced in overall power though.<br />
<br />
<br />
Summa Summarum : Biggest problems with hybrids is between Warriors and Knights.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">In exp groups...<br />
<br />
Wanna bet that you use your useless buffs, more times then I use my defensive????????<br />
<br />
Still nice to see that not all knights are blinded by their paranoia and ego.<br />
<br />
Love how paladins have the trend now, of coming here and saying:<br />
&quot;I agree Warriors are unbalanced, and wanted to support you,<br />
but you want to be better then us.. so fuck you.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
How about let's take away those buffs you call useless? Swipe them out....<br />
I'd be willing to bet my whole fortune, that the entire community of paladins would go on an uproar.<br />
<br />
Are they as useless as ... say... <br />
/discipline charge? or /discipline mightystrike? or /discipline resist? or /discipline fearless? or /discipline fellstrike? or Disarm?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Ender</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Both groups of players downplay the usefullness of their abilities.  Warriors for instance downplay their small tanking edge and small dps edge as well as their disciplines, all are important but none are game breakingly important.  Truth is paladins rarely use their HP buffs outside of the brells line.  Sure they get used sometimes and yes giving paladins the 63 symbol was probably a mistake since it pushes our hp buff ability over a clerics but in the long run it really is not a very big deal.  You don't generally pick a paladin to be in a group just for his buffs and on a raid, well you need 1 paladin to handle brells and thats it.<br />
<br />
In higher end groups a few more hps generally just doesn't matter, even a beastlord with their pathetic heals can keep a group alive on easier zones and a cleric/druid/shaman can keep up with healing on harder zones.  So in lower end groups with a shaman healer a paladins buffs are a big boon, in lower end groups with a druid healer paladins buffs are a small boon and in high end groups or low end groups with a cleric healer paladin's buffs are a non issue... thats all outside of brells of course, which isn't really any better than the ranger or BL equivalent spells.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">This was the only thing I was trying to get all.  Ender is absolutely correct the everyone overstates issues including this one.  As I said, anyone who claims that they aren't useful are trying to sell something just like the ones who claim they are too powerful.<br />
<br />
If you want to make an out of game, on paper assement, fine but never be surprised when someone states that in game reality is a bit different.  Conventional wisdom shows that these spells are interesting but not that useful.  I'm happy to have them but they plainly don't work in today's game.  The only ones I would keep are Marzin and Brell's...the rest are difficult to use.<br />
<br />
Besides, its a red herring.  How much HP will fix Warriors?  I don't see any level of HP fixing Warrior's systemic problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Shadowfrost</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">No one single thing will fix warriors' systemic problems, actually.<br />
<br />
This is because warriors have fallen behind in several different ways, so several different fixes are needed.  One is to restore the warrior's tanking advantage:-  That's got to come from either damage mitigation or additional hp.  Another is to restore the warrior to the position of viable taunter; inferior taunter to a knight maybe, but able to take aggro at least some of the time.<br />
<br />
A level of hp will not solve warrior problems in and of itself, but it has to form part of the fix.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Aeka,<br />
<br />
In LDoN Druids and Shaman are often healers. Pickup groups are extremely common. In such an environment Warriors often have a LOT less HP's than an equivilant Paladin. By a LOT, I mean 1k HP's+. Add to this the Paladin's ability to lock aggro quickly, Root, and heal and there isn't a contest.<br />
<br />
In one month of asking, I still have not gotten a reply to offering to donate for Brells SS in PoT with any character. So in a group without a Paladin a Warrior will likely have his 600HP &quot;advantage&quot; - AoTC -Brells. What advantage?<br />
<br />
If he does not have time to run back to PoT and his group lacks a Paladin or a Cleric, we are talking a LOT less HP's than a Paladin in the same group.<br />
<br />
So let's not downplay the buff advantage. It's not 230 HP's by any stretch of the imagination. Until they put vendors in the East Commonlands tunnel that will buff you for a fee, the Paladin ability to buff themselves and their group IS useful for any group lacking a Cleric.<br />
<br />
BB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">Conventional wisdom shows that these spells are interesting but not that useful. <br />
<br />
Ah, but we are also only talking about the buffs here.<br />
Which is also why I would rather onsider ALL your spells as a bundle + Your Melee skill = Hybrid of choice.<br />
<br />
So if one part goes up, the other part must go down - Otherwise you become out of balance.<br />
<br />
And the simple fact is, that the Knights have a lot of Mellee skill these days AND a great spellbook, which makes them overall unbalanced.<br />
<br />
I mean, I haven't heard any knights try and downplay the importance of Stuns / Snare / Feign Death / other very commonly used spell.<br />
<br />
<br />
Offcourse, since the thread started about Paladin Buffs, the point is a bit moot I guess, since you are only considering a small part of a Paladin. Just like you would only be considering a small part of a Warrior if you were only focusing on ... humm .. their Dodge skill or something.<br />
<br />
summa summarum : The buffs are nice and worth quite a bit balance wise.</div></div><hr />
