<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>osserkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Yep another one of those threads :) I'm in a rather small guild with maybe 10k to work with. We just started on our flags and i'm able to MT in tier 1 planes, but i realize i'll need major upgrades to MT tier 2 and up. <br />
<br />
Please take a look at my stuff and tell me where i need help the most.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zanakus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ouch, you definitely have some work to do on your ac. Remember that for each level you should aim to get 20 more ac - at 59, you should have roughly 20 x 59, equaling 1180 ac. And those guidelines are for a non-raiding warrior.<br />
<br />
 Sell the crafted pauldrons, crusty greaves and boots, mithril arms, dragon bone bracelet and black sapphire electrum earring. <br />
<br />
 Here's what I'd replace those with if I were in your situation and needed to get decent gear fast:<br />
<br />
 Earring: Vah Shir Claw or Lupine Frenzy Earring are good but can be expensive; Geomancer's Ritual Hoop (80-ish AP at Takish camp) is actually pretty decent as well and should hold you over for a little while.<br />
<br />
 Neckpiece: Amulet of Mummy Wrappings goes for several hundred plat on my server and has 12 ac, 45 hp, 3 stamina and some decent resists. I'd buy it.<br />
<br />
 Shoulders: Wretched Pauldrons aren't too bad, but they fluctuate in price and aren't sold too often, at least on Rallos. Get them if you can find them cheap.<br />
<br />
 Greaves: Blood Runed Greaves are excellent but expensive, same with Greaves of the Orcish Master. Buy them if you can afford them, otherwise save up AP for Malevolent legs.<br />
<br />
 Boots: Kingly Boots of Splendor are excellent as are Greatbear Hide Boots, you may want to consider them if you have the money. If you don't, save up AP for Malevolent boots.<br />
<br />
 Bracer: Rock-Molded Wristguard is incredible - if you have enough money to get it, do so.<br />
<br />
 Arms: Blood-Spattered Vambraces are amazing for the price, try to get them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>osserkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thank You Zanakus for your help... i knew i was in bad shape but I'll surely check for those items and get myself better</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Frostpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Lots of choices on gear. shop around. <br />
<br />
More importantly, and this is URGENT: do not spend any more AA's until you do some research about which to get. This is just my opinion, but it is a terrible waste to spend the AA's you have spent in general category. Please re-evaluate your AA plan.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Frostpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">opinions on optimum path vary, but please at least consider the following:<br />
<br />
Combat Agility, Combat Stability, Natural Durability from Archetype<br />
Area Taunt from Class (this should be before a lot of these others)<br />
Planar Durability from PoP Advanced<br />
Inate Defense and Lightning Reflexes from PoP Abilities<br />
<br />
The above are really the meat and potatoes of our AA, giving great HP yield and improved mitigation. Tons of posts on this stuff if you use search feature. That inate wisdom on your magelo made me cry like a baby, hehe. Ayway, hope this is of some help. Hate to see ya put in all that hard work earning AA's and not get good return on them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Frostpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Osserkon***Halt***Please Read Above!!!!<br />
<br />
I will not be able to sleep till i see you reply, hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>osserkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yes I agree about my AA &quot;screw-ups&quot; In my defence i was not leveling at the time... I was doing Naggy and Vox raids with a friend and waiting for guildies to catch up in level so they could go on them too. <br />
<br />
All AA xp has stopped for me since I went to level 53 and Naggy/Vox were left behind. I have every intenion of doing my defensive AA'S and go the proper route once i get to 65<br />
<br />
But by all means keep the good advice coming in guys-- i'm all ears  :) <br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

Everfrost LDoN's are your friend, start camping here like mad. Not only can u save points for Malevolent pieces (boots, arms and legs for u first dude), but the Mask of Frozen Mana also drops semi-commonly in that dungeon, not a bad face piece. Replace the Abomination Ring with a VRoG.<br />
<br />
Steel Wrapped Leggings are a good CHEAP option for legs, with raw hps onboard, and the Kingly Boots of Splendor willl improve ur feet alot. <br />
<br />
Do the LDoN's tho. Don't have to spend a copper then :)<br />
<br />
If ur doing Tier 1 bosses, go try Statue of Rallos Zek, and get the Erad BP. More AC, lotsa stamina and more raw hp's.<br />
<br />
Crafted Pauldrons gotta go dude. What faction are with CoV atm? If u r ally (and a SoRZ/IoRZ/AoW kill will really help this), do the Draconic Pauldrons quest in WW/SS in Velious. Really easy to do, more ac and +12 on both str and sta.</div></div><hr />
