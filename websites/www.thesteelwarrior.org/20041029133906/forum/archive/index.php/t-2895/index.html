<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bloodthorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all, and thank you for your time. <br />
I recently transfered from servers, and as you know that means im running around with my non high level gear. Anyhow, my question is this, being new to The Rathe server, i am wondering if it is possible to solo beyond level 57? On my old server, sure i was guilded, but the guild like all guilds disband and sometimes people move on..So soloing, well was not an issue, there was always someone on whom needed help and in returned helped you.. but On my own? Thats a different question. <br />
So any suggestions and imputs would be greatly appreciated. Of course I know that being partnered at my level would be better, but my odd hours of play and time of play may make it hard to do so, well soloing would be great. <br />
Thank you for any and all responses. <br />
Sorry i was long winded</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>lovax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">there's been a couple threads about this sorta thing before... best advice i can give you is as follows:<br />
<br />
1 - try to get regen item<br />
2 - try to get some good procs (slow, snare, etc)<br />
3 - have run3, jboots, or sow<br />
<br />
a friend of mine used to &quot;fungi kite&quot; I think he called it.  He's equip a really hard hitting but slow weapon, get close to the mob, attack it, turn off attack and keep running, then repeat.  Basically attack the mob whenever your weapon cycles but stay out of range regening with fungi otherwise.<br />
<br />
I heard that some warriors with proper gear could solo in PoJ some, but I never tried.<br />
<br />
I'm at 65, no slow proc, and mediocre gear at best and about all I can solo is hill giants :P.<br />
<br />
From all I've read and experienced though, warrior solo comes down entirely to the kind of gear you have.  Sorry if I've not been much help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xarim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Nah the rats in PoJ are completely soloable. They have next to no HP, and cant hit for shit. When I would get like around 90ish% aa and wanted to ding and couldnt get a group I would get a druid/sham to haste me and regen me and go trash the rats till I dinged. Hehe would probably be easier now but the xp gain isnt really worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bloodthorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thank you for the above posted replys.. its hard when a person is new to a server.. Hehe i noticed that there were alot of looks but only two replys.. Plane of Justice.. rats.. <br />
good to go. <br />
<br />
thank you again</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gnomb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Most of us stopped soloing a lot earlier because it wasnt worth the downtime.<br />
At least soloing for exp, farming guk or hill giants for pp is another matter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>SwordKitty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you still need help, look up Swordhammer on the Rathe, unless I'm raiding or in a middle of an Adventure I'd be happy to help ya out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bloodthorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thank you.. Im on the Rathe.. so if you are not busy.. ill hit ya up with a question..<br />
<br />
thank you all above on your help.</div></div><hr />
