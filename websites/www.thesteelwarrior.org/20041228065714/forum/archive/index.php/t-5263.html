I am not that much of a raiding warrior, I just want to get some AAs for now. So far I have Run3 Regen3 and ND2. I am working on ND3 now and i am wondering when I should get AE taunt. I plan to do CS1, CA1, PE, then finish CS and CA, then go on to LR5 ID5 then finally AE taunt. Is that good plan? Or do I need to throw in AE taunt in there before ID5 somewhere?<br />
<br />
BTW I am kinda hurting for HP right now. I currently have 4600hp 1200 ac 1150 atk(?). I also have CHoS and Elphorn's Cleaver both with ANger 2 augs so I am not having much trouble holding aggro, just staying alive while i have aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bulbog</div><div class="date">01-17-2004, 08:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Still very useful, tank switches, multiple pulls where healing needs to land quickly and mezzes aren't in yet, and just when you can't get aggro off a debuffer sometimes heh.  Incite and AE taunt of both really used for different purposes, AE taunt= taking advantage of no-fail taunt and incite just a small boost in hate.</div></div><hr />

You're gonna be amazed at how often you'll need it to save the party. Especially with LDoN, when 4+ pulls happen, you give the party a good chance to survive, regardless if you go down (AT the reposte disc is a nice combo).<br />
<br />
You'll be thrilled when you instantly pull two mobs off the cleric, not to mention the rest of the party.<br />
<br />
Its the best 5 AA you're gonna spend.</div></div><hr />

A 100% chance for a successful taunt is great; taunting all the mobs on an overpull then popping furious and defensive is great; grabbing all the built up aggro from debuffers on permarooted mobs is great etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Personialy *I* would want to get closer towards 5k hp and then get AoE followed by defensive AA's but it reaily depends on what your regular groups are, if you have a good puller that never brings more than 1-2 or if you group with outher tanks often and they off tank adds or if you usualy have CC that locks things down fast you have less reason to get AoE taunt and would be better served getting AA's to increase your survival rate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With the knowledge I have now I would have spent points in AE taunt at lvl 10 if that was possible :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just what exactly is the range supposed to be on AE Taunt? I have had concerns over using it when multiples are pulled in LDON. If there are mobs in the next room, which often is not that far away, would it cause them to aggro as well?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">01-19-2004, 01:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In the Bazaar at Nexus bank on the south side.  Stand immediately next to Ward Lillie on his west side.  AE taunt will hit both bankers on the west side, and the ward on the west side.  It will also hit the south east banker.  It will not hit the south east ward, the north east banker, or the north east ward.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draganetti</div><div class="date">01-19-2004, 02:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">AE taunt range seems to be just slightly larger than the normal taunt range.  (This is just my personal opinion/experience.)  You basically need to be in melee range of the center of the target to count on it landing, including z-axis.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As a small race (Dwarf), I've had a number of problems with AE taunt not hitting boss mobs when a normal taunt will.  It's most frequently a problem on larger mobs with &quot;high&quot; hit boxes, if I have to be careful about moving out of heal range.<br />
<br />
There is a difference in range between taunt and AE taunt, but I haven't a clue how to test it.</div></div><hr />
