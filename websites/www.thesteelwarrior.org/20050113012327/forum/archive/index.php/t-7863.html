<br />
My guild's biggest hindrance right now is finding the damn bosses up.  We're fairly casual and we schedule our raid times.  We don't normally start until 8:30 EST which basically means any high demand mob is already dead if it spawned earlier in the evening.  2 years plus since PoP came out and we STILL can't find Vallon Zek up.  /rude Sony devs for making a required flag mob readily farmable by a group or two and giving him drops they apparently want to farm.<br />
<br />
VZ was up last night.  I know approximately what time he was killed give or take an hour.  Once again he died right after he spawned.</div></div><hr />

This is your bigest problem You cant and wont progress in PoP unless you can form up and raid on a whim. The PoP mobs are always farmable. I know one person on TZ that is known as the &quot;Box queen&quot; She has about a group of toons she boxes (all female char's lol) She takes down ALL the BoT tower bosses. Sod if they are up you must get up there and take them down.  That is what sucks about you guys that dont play on a PvP server. You cant guard a zone. See on TZ we can XP in a zone that we want to get on our timer and if anybody from another guild zones in we kill them. Untill they show up with a larger force or train us out then the war for controll of the zone begins.  I have been involved with mass PvP for 2-3 hours +. I am talking 45-60+ people frome each guild  all out war. It is the best part about my server. <br />
  Sorry off topic a bit. But the best thing to do is find all those sites that tell you about each mob they might have a timer listed. Also  like I said inorder to progress in most high end places you cant have &quot;set times&quot; now you can have set times for people to log on but then you can cut yourself short like it sounds like your doing.  Have you done SSRA and VT yet? If not do that. If you kill just one of the taskmasters then people cant start the cursed event. So every 45 minutes kill a taskmaster and wait for the week-2week spawn time mob to spawn and then do the event. (cant remember the name of the mob that needs to spawn)<br />
Only way you can have set times is if the mob is on your timer and you know exactly when he is suposed to spawn.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daabu</div><div class="date">07-01-2004, 02:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its actually a 3day spawn +/- 12hrs (so 2.5 - 3.5 days) for most nameds.<br />
<br />
BoT minis are 8hrs, I believe.<br />
Birds/Druav in PoFire are 36hrs.<br />
Everything else is 3day +/- 12hrs, with times for failures changing things a bit (Coirnav, Bertoxxulus, etc)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fenring</div><div class="date">07-01-2004, 03:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah just saying the earliest you want to start camping the mob is 2.5 days if you want to be sure to get the jump on the spawn. I know the first time we got VZ we went in there early and just pulled trash for a couple hours and killed Anival the Blade a few times to get ornate pants until vZ popped.</div></div><hr />

Well, true and not true I guess.  My present guild has set raid times three times a week and we are at RZtW right now (the guild was doing NToV/early Luclin six months ago).  It's definitely a casual raiding guild and apart from the core members, the rest are on for about 2/3rds of the raids.  Yeah, that means lots and lots of backflagging but it is still pretty rare that we can't find *any* flagging mobs up on a given raid time.<br />
<br />
That's going to vary by server though of course and I'll fully admit that finding the Zeks or SolRo minis up is painful at times.  Still, depending on your server, a set-time casual raiding guild can indeed progress at least to the EPlanes.  I've no doubt we'll have tremendous headaches finding things up in the EP though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">07-01-2004, 04:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just think it sucks that PoP is still very popular :p so mobs are hard to find up if you need certain flags, but what's worse is that the devs still haven't corrected the advancement problem they created.  Guilds need the flags to advance but can't get the mobs because people who play EQ constantly are farming them for drops.  That's a content problem.  If it's worth farming, people will farm it.  If it's also required for advancement, guild progression will be blocked by farmers, whether intentionally or not.  That sucks.<br />
<br />
BoT minis aren't for advancement so that's not the same thing at all.  I have always thought it sucks that if you have a chanter they're much easier to farm with just a couple people or our hydra player.  Different topic though...<br />
<br />
We can usually find SOME flag mob up, but it's the same ones all the time.  We do a lot of backflagging because casual players won't be at every raid, but we still have almost no reason to hit many of the mobs we can find up a lot.  Meanwhile other flag mobs are never up.  You can tell which ones are more worth farming.</div></div><hr />
