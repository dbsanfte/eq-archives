<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ohsoluvli</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Don't see me getting a BoC anytime soon in a guild of maybe 10 semi active players.  Was using copper hammer and ornate stone, but just acquired a split blade and bought a velium gemmed longsword.  Are these worth using b4 i'm able to get hate augs through ldon?  <br />

<br />
I know i'm losing the stunner hate, but can usually keep aggro fine with my 2hander equipped thus assume I should be ok with these 2 weapons now.  Thanks for the help  :D .<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">procs &gt; DPS for agro.  Those weapons are great DPS weapons but not good agro weapons.<br />
<br />
Think about it this way:<br />
<br />
Weapon with agro proc + anger3 &gt;&gt;&gt; weapon w/out proc + Anger 3 / weapon with agro proc &gt; weapon w/out proc<br />
<br />
or <br />
<br />
A copper hammer with anger 3 will be better than a splitblade with anger 3 which is better than a copper hammer without aug which is better than a splitblade without aug<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
more procs = win /nod</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Sell the splitblade pls. It sucks so bad. I h8 it. It is an overpriced piece of shit. Sell it and save for something else. Ornate Stone Battle Hammer also sucks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Otheuym</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have to agree with Shirion. Unless you want a DPS set of weapons for when you are not tanking and do not want agro, I would sell the Splitblade, Ornate Stone Hammer, and the Gemmed Longsword and buy a Sword of the Bloodsworn and main hand the Copper Hammer of Striking and offhand the Sword of the Bloodsworn. It is a decent agro combo especially for the price.</div></div><hr />
