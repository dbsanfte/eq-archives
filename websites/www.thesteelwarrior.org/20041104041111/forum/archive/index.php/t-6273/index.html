<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aeryl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm not sure if this has been asked before, but I wasn't around for the first 3 months of LDoN.  Since we know that weapons have innate proc rates, does adding an Anger aug to a weapon with a hate proc really help?  For example, let's say your un-auged hate weapon will proc 2 times per minute.  If you add Anger III will it now have a chance to proc, say 4 times a minute, or will it still be two procs per minute but only varying between the different procs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>KoGuiN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">will make it 4 times a  min</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shaiel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Multiple procs on a weapon do not interfere with each other.  You can even proc two separate effects on the same swing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gothmaug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've never owned a dual-proc weapon.  Does that mean either proc can fire on any swing, independent of the other proc?  Or do both procs always fire together?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>DiomedXegony</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">From my understanding they are independent of each other.  On say an auged bow it does a proc check for eb then a proc check for anger.  The procs firing together would be just a lucky swing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">They are independant.  You can have one proc fire on one swing, then the other proc fire on the next, then both fire on the same swing, or you can have one proc four times in a row and the other not proc at all, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bonequest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I think it checks the original proc and if it doesn't go off it checks the added proc.   If the original proc goes off it doesn't check the added one so I don't think you can get two on one swing.  You can proc twice or more in one combat round and it could look like two in one swing but it is probably from main and off hand procs going off close to each other.   I also think you can proc on double and tripple attack swings but not on flurries and ripostes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shaiel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You can proc more than one effect on one swing.  This is a fact.</div></div><hr />

You can proc more than one effect on one swing.  This is a fact.  I'd like to see proof of this. SOE specifically explained that weapons can only proc a single time per swing. If the innate proc triggers, no other procs are checked. Order of checking is innate, augment, spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shaiel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Augment a weapon with an innate proc and go find something to beat on.  Eventually, it'll happen, though it will take a long time.  For proof you need to:<br />
1 - Only swing once.  No double attack, triple attack, flurry, punishing blade, etc.<br />
2 - Proc the innate effect.<br />
3 - Proc the augmented effect.<br />
<br />
The chances of all three happening at the same time is quite rare.  You can proc as many times as you have things to proc for each swing.  Both my weapons have 3 procs (innate, augment, and spell) so I've seen it happen several times.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've done this and over 70 hours of parsing (parsing sinister strike and offhand weapon dps), I've yet to have a natural proc and an augment proc fire on the same swing.<br />
<br />
As far as the original question, if you have 305 dex, you should see the natural proc fire an average of 2 times per minute and the augment fire around 1.9 times per minute (pre- WA and 0 CE)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Keane Abrams</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">You can even proc two separate effects on the same swing. <br />
<br />
Prove it. I want to see the log.<br />
<br />
Next thing you will tell us you can weapon proc on a flurry. (and yeah, I want to see the log on that too)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I want to see proof as well of two procs on a single swing.<br />
<br />
2 procs in a round (say, double/triple/punishing/flurry), yeah, that's possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Shaiel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">What good would a log do?  Those are sooooo hard to doctor...<br />
<br />
Like I said, it's pretty damn rare to see.  How often do you proc 2 effects on even the same round?  Now try to have 2 procs on the same swing, without firing off double/triple attack, flurry, etc.  Another hinderance to seeing this is that all the procs from your mainhand or offhand attack round are displayed before any melee damage, regardless of which swing actually procced.  So if you triple attack, and swing 1 and 3 proc, it'll show up as 2 procs, then 3 swings.<br />
<br />
Even with 3 procs per weapon, I've conclusively seen it maybe 5 times in the past 6 months.  Either believe me or don't; doesn't matter to me.  But that's how it works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The problem is, until you provide proof, best one is from screenshots, pretty much no one will believe you, and consider you wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Shaiel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">There must be a reason people don't think you can proc more than 1 effect on the same swing, and I'm curious as to why this seems to be the default conclusion.  If it's just that it's a rare occurrance and many people don't have 2 procs on their weapons, that's fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">70 hours of parsing rare?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>thundersam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I have never ever seen two procs on 1 swing with 1 weapon, say my vdd with anger 3, never ever never have i seen it and thats what rest here say aswell :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
You have no clue what you are talking about. None. You just told us that you &quot;see&quot; two procs on one swing. Post the logs and prove it. Looking at character animations and text as it passes by your melee window means nothing.<br />
<br />
Man, I am starting to feel like Haas does.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Shaiel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">And I've said many times, it's a rare thing to happen.  How often do you even get 2 procs in 1 round of attacks?  And every time that's happened, how many swings were there?  The chances of only taking 1 swing is rare.  The chance of proccing off that 1 swing is even more rare.  The chance of proccing a second effect, again on that same swing, is rarer still.  I've seen it maybe 5 times ever, and that's with 3 procs on both my weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Shaiel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Um, ok.  So, say I proc twice on 1 swing.  Then I attack again.  How the hell is a parse going to show that?  It'll look like:<br />
proc<br />
proc<br />
swing<br />
swing<br />
<br />
A log cannot distinguish between the rounds of attacks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">How can you?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Shaiel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Stop attacking after the 1 swing round...  again, that's why it's rather hard to notice when it happens.  You need something to distinguish between the rounds of attacks, like someone casting a spell, or a mob hitting you, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Mourningloree</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Ok so I'm confused.<br />
<br />
Someone using very small words explain to me in what possible shape or form is 2 proc messages in a row (IF such a thing existed) not from the same round?<br />
<br />
EITHER all procs appear just after the combat message (90% sure) OR all procs appear just BEFORE the combat message.<br />
<br />
There's not going to be a case where 50% of the time it goes:<br />
Swing<br />
Proc<br />
and 50% of the time it goes<br />
Proc<br />
Swing<br />
<br />
THEREFORE if there are 2 procs in a row they would be by the same swing would they not be?  (Assuming you have misses on hits on yadda yadda.)  Or am I missing something completely fundamental here?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">A log cannot distinguish between the rounds of attacks.Neither can you. You can't count on the animation because that is not necessarily sync'd with what is really going on.<br />
<br />
Stop attacking after the 1 swing round... again, that's why it's rather hard to notice when it happens. You need something to distinguish between the rounds of attacks, like someone casting a spell, or a mob hitting you, etc.Every event you have listed is mutually exclusive to a round of weapon attacks. Any one of those things can happen mid attack. Besides, if you have to stop attacking after 1 swing round to notice when it happened, how is it that you noticed it 5 times in 6 months? You stop attacking mid fight much?<br />
<br />
At least on a log, you have a timestamp that can at least give you some idea of how many attacks you have in 1 round. I'll see if I can find the dev post that cleared up how aug procs work, its been a while and I don't remember if it was on this board or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Das_bert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I have a cleric friend who weapon proc'd his delightful orb of forgotten magic, he said he saw it double proc a couple times.  Only buff he had was Yaulp for haste.</div></div><hr />

You don't need to go to that extreme.  Just put a stein or something in primary to prevent a melee attack and a weapon in offhand and parse away on your parse mob.  You'll have less double attacks in offhand and it's easier to distinguish all of your swings.  With ferocity 3 and ambidexterity, you should see a 67% double attack rate in your offhand.  The closest I've seen to a double proc is an augment firing and a natural proc firing on a double attack swing in offhand.  I'm not as heavy of a parser as some on this forum, but with over 1 gig of parses, you'd think I'd notice at one time or another a natural proc or augment firing twice on the same swing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Alisdahre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">&quot;There must be a reason people don't think you can proc more than 1 effect on the same swing, and I'm curious as to why this seems to be the default conclusion.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cause if I remember right, SOE said so when explaining it.  They said what someone else stated above.  That the primary proc is checked, if it doesn't go off the secondary proc is then checked.  If the primary did go off, the secondary is not checked that &quot;swing&quot; (not round, but swing, as there can be multiple swings in one round of combat).<br />
<br />
As for turning off auto attack when you've swung once, that would prove to be quite the tedious pain.  How did you see these double procs on a single swing?  Was it hunting in a group?  Or was it through the turn off auto attack method?  You'd have to swing and turn off auto attack every swing, everytime you hunt, for a very very long time to have any hopes of ever catching it I'd imagine.  And well, that makes for some crappy DPS and aggro, so I doubt your groups would like it... or it makes for a very boring stretch of pounding on some rooted mob solo.  Would worse than waiting for Stormfeather to spawn.  And from how we were told how it works, and how most of us believe it works, it would be like waiting for Stormfeather to spawn in the Nexus.<br />
<br />
If you saw it in a group while hunting, did you have misses turned on?  Chances are it was a double or triple attack, of which only the first swing landed.  We can proc on misses, mobs can't, but we can.<br />
<br />
Also, what are these 3 procs on both weapons that you're talking about?  Aren't Strikethrough and Instrument effects worn effects?  Not procced?  (going off the weapons in your Magelo).</div></div><hr />
