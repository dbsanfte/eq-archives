<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kurghann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What yas think ? <br />
Not sure myself but Evasive seem to work ok , at least after using furious to build up some aggro and let a lil time to debuffer to do their job and live /smircks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Mobs tend to have a high ATK. Defensive/Stonewall better, mobs with that high attack rip right through evasive</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">They do not have high attack.  Evasive is most likely still going to mitigate more DPS.  However, seeing the number of healers is limited it is more important to worry about spikes as opposed to average DPS which is why you should use Stonewall/Defensive.<br />
<br />
Also, some mobs have high accuracy, but not attack.  Archers, in particular, seems to hit much more often than the average mob, which limits the usefulness of Evasive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Mobs with high atk do not &quot;rip through&quot; evasive.  But defensive is less useful on mobs that have low atk, so evasive is sometimes used on mobs that would ordinarily be tanked with defensive, but have such low atk that the majority of their hits are for minimum, making Defensive ineffective.  <br />
<br />
From what I have heard GoD mobs have a large variability in thier hits similar to PoP mobs, so they are most likely best tanked with defensive.  If a mob has a low DB but a high DI, meaning there is a big difference between their max and min hit, and they are getting a reasonable hit distribution (not all minimum hits) then defensive is the way to go.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Evasive almost certainly mitigates more damage than Stonewall/Defensive now.  But that's just average DPS.  When working with a limited number of healers it is more important that you always survive as opposed to taking the least average DPS possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've found defensive better on Archer type mobs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zynth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i went into vxed using evasive and quickly switched over to defensive. the min damage i took was 200ish, max was 1100.<br />
also, i thought it would be interesting to mention that i tanked all of it with my unaugmented bloodfrenzy and BoT shield (since i dont have a decent agro 2hs). i held agro just as well as if i were duel wielding. i still lost agro every now and then, but it was no differnet than if i was tanking normally. i *think* once or twice i even turned agro back to me with a bash. but right now it's all just speculation. i think its simply that the BFs higher proc rate is just so much better that it doesnt matter that the off hand is. i defenitally wasnt losting agro due to my lack of DPS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've done this trial 5 times now, I use furious at the start to give the cleric some breathing room for the first heal.  If he's really doing a ton of DPS make sure he's dispelled on pull ;P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gurgeh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Did some test comparing evasive vs defensive in Ikkinz, and at worst evasive dps = defensive dps, but usually it seems that using evasive we get an average 50 less dps (on minis).<br />
<br />
However it probably depends on your AC : with 1800 it would be just foolish to use evasive, while using defensive with 2400 AC could be a waste.<br />
<br />
Was wondering if anyone could tell what dps does Diabolic Destroyer with what AC ? I'm trying to figure if this is insanely difficult because of the 'lack' of gear (read : not yet full quarm stuffed ...) or if you really have to not only have a perfect group but also be lucky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Hyardgune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I used Evasive on fake RZ last night and I got beaten like a mime in a biker bar.  He barely ever missed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>FulorianC</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Evasive does nothing if your AC is too low for a mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Evasive also does nothing if you're a fatass ogre who obscures heavenly bodies without trying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Those are pretty much my own conclusions as well.  If you have enough AC to mitigate most of the hits down to near or at minimum, then hitting Defensive really won't do you much good.  You're better off just trying to evade the hits entirely, hence the point of Evasive.<br />
<br />
Now, I'm not entirely sure what affects the hit rate of mobs, but I'd probably narrow it down to exactly what level they are.  Take two mobs, Inny in Hate and Avatar of War in Kael, for example, both of which are red con. AoW had an almost 70% connection rate on me while Inny in Hate had around 40% or so.  If I had access to my comp at home, as I'm at work at the moment, I'd get you guys the exact hit percentages.  Using this info, I'd say Inny is probably level 68-70 in fact, or just barely a red con.  By my guess, AoW is probably 80-85 at least.  Now, on a mob like AoW and, of course, Rallos Zek, I'd say going Evasive is near useless since they're so high level they hit you anyways.  Not to mention, well, these guys have some insane ATK ratings. :)<br />
<br />
I now use Evasive on Vindi since, suprisingly enough, his ATK is pretty low and I'm now sorta at the point where most of his hits are near minimum.  I also use Evasive on Korucust, but that's also because he has a nasty unresistable 1600dd proc as well.<br />
<br />
Btw, you guys are going to laugh when I say this, but it's true.  Maestro of Rancor in Hate parses more dps than Inny does.  I parsed Maestro to just a shmidgen over 500dps last night and my previous parses show Inny at ~440.  Wait a minute, who's the god here?  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Attack has nothing to do with hit accuracy.  From a parse a while ago RZ's debuff (Sedition) lowers your chance to evade which makes Evasive not as useful.<br />
<br />
Some mobs just hit more accurately than others.  Archers in GoD comes to mind.  Evasive just gets hosed by those guys because they miss so little.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>kurghann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">*clap clap* heheheh i m concerned about Evasive VS defensive on GOD mobs in Tipt trials and above ....<br />
 Thx all for the inputs about these , pretty much what i felt so far but need to try some more tho , didn t tank Kod nasty beasts yet .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Splaktar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">In Tipt I've found that Evasive works great on normal pulls/mobs.  It drastically reduces the DPS that I take, very noticably, I've had clerics comment on it with surprise.<br />
<br />
On the bosses though I use Stonewall.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Brackon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Someone had already touched on it, but the best way I have found to deal with the Tipt boss ( or Kod Trials ) was to start out Furious, then when it drops hit Defensive. The furious gives enough time for the debuffs to land, then your just in it for 60 seconds of fun in the sun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">In a 1 group environement<br />

Reducing Spikes &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Reducing DPS<br />
<br />
Because if u die, there are not 4 5 other wars just waiting to tank.<br />
And 10 clerics to heal them.<br />
<br />
Stonewall is totally awesome for that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Gurgeh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">In a 1 group environement reducing dps &gt; everything else. When you fight DD and your cleric(s) end up at 5 mana you'll be glad to have reduced the dps by 5-10% using the best of evasive or defensive considering your AC. Reducing dmg spike is for CH healing, I doubt any tank can live through an Ikkinz named with a 2 clerics CH rotation at this point of the game, I also doubt many clerics have enough mana to just chain SL all fight long, so reducing dps is your main concern in this case.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>kurghann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">kikou emilia ! woot good to see you :) <br />
seems that we all agree that after using furious to let debuffer do their job without being turned into red pile of flesh and bones , defensive is working better than evasive on boss ?? <br />
or did i read sumthin wrong heheh !??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Aielman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">First KT trial in Ikk, the first named hits for a max of 2750, and rips off 8 hits per round. With a full buffed AC of about 2250 or so, I'm getting hit 8 times for an average of 900 per hit while using Defensive/Stonewall, with at least 1 or 2 hits being at 1375. The max round did just over 9k damage in one round....and the cleric has no time to cast CH.<br />
<br />
So use evasive if you think it'll work. I wouldn't recommend it.<br />
<br />
peace,<br />
Aielman</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">You do not react to damage taken in Ikkinz trials.  Doing so will guaranteed a quick death.  You just have your healers blast heal (or CH if you're brave) as fast as possible and hope the mob dies before you run out of mana.<br />
<br />
Reducing DPS is therefore not as useful as reducing spikes because you do not save the healer's mana either way.  Evasive almost certainly will beat Stonewall in damage reduced, but it does not beat Stonewall in spikes reduced (a mob can still hit 4 times a row under evasive for higher spikes).  Also Stonewall lets you do more damage than Evasive, and that difference is significant when you're looking at a fight where every bit of DPS counts.<br />
<br />
The only reason to use Evasive would be if you've 2 clerics doing a CH chain on you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Gurgeh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">If you are using CH you can't react in anyway to damage spike, if you are using fast heal, you can react to damage spike. <br />
Using a 2 cleric rotation with evasive would just be foolish. With defensive too at this point of GoD anyway, even on Diabolic Destroyer that has a fairly low dps he still killed our defensive war with a 6.5 sec rota.<br />
As for saying you can't react to damage spike in those trials,  I did not feel it's true, considering you are using 2 clerics, you have at least 2 reliable way to prevent bad spike from killing tank : DI and Divine Arbitration (ie you can use 3 DI 2 DvA in a fight).<br />
<br />
My group mostly used stonewall, because those 50 or so extra dps are welcome, but we also killed all the 1st mini named with evasive, and healing was sometimes significantly easier.<br />
<br />
I found those trial quite interesting to test the difference between stonewall / def / evasive, considering the amount of wipe and fight against mobs that hit decently hard. If your healers just can't heal you give a shot to evasive, if your fight is lasting over 120 sec, use stonewall. Good place to play with the different disc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>thundersam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Im using stonewall exclusivly since it was available, dps shortens the fight and my job is to stay alive best availably way which in most cases stonewall do a better job at. Only fights id use different disc on is mobs that move alot. Stonewall&gt;all i say:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">On a 2K+ hitter a &quot;Spike&quot; can mean 5k to 11k dmg.<br />
Thats a single bad quad.<br />
<br />
Its mostly the reason i do not trust evasive.<br />
The thing is spikes are bound to happen anyway.<br />
Keeping the fight short (GoD) keeps the probabitlity of getting spiked really low.<br />
<br />
Still i find it totally absurd to use evasive on a mob that can 2K+<br />
In a single group environement, because that single spike<br />
(suppose DI fails), will get you killed and the group wiped.<br />
Of course its related to mob ATK rating (see xegony).<br />
But still, i dont trust evasive that much.<br />
<br />
If you are using CH you can't react in anyway to damage spike, if you are using fast heal, you can react to damage spike. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So far i am not impressed by GoD ATK ratings, but by ATK speed &amp; Accuracy.<br />
<br />
Still i prefer stonewall to lessen &quot;spikes&quot; and keep up decent DPS<br />
<br />
Ps : Salut toi :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Timmok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I've tried using both evasive and defensive/stonewall on the diabolic destroyer in ikkinz1, the best run so far was with stonewall(got it to 2% ahhh). The attempt where I used evasive I was smooshed by a string of 5 hits in a row :/ ..<br />
<br />
Evasive is nice on raids where there is both backup tanks and also backup clerics that can throw you a new DI if it triggers. Unless you have 3 healers, it is a bit risky to try to reapply DI mid-fight on the diabolic destroyer.<br />
<br />
Therefore on this particular one I prefer stonewall. But its the same concent in the tipt trial for instance. You need everyones DPS and you cant afford spikes/death.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">GoD attack values seem pretty standard.  Some mobs definitely have pumped accuracy rating though (Archers).<br />
<br />
Evasive works well when it is not likely you will die in between heals because it saves you more DPS.  However saving more damage doesn't help when it means you can die between heals, which does happen on Ikkinz trials, especially if you're not loaded with healers.<br />
<br />
Stonewall also has the advantage of adding about 50% of your own DPS (assuming you do half DPS with other discs) to the fight.</div></div><hr />
