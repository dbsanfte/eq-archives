<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Razzinel</div><div class="date">08-04-2003, 05:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
a warrior in my guild recently got got the FB VI shield from Earth: Aegis of the Earth.  He has been tanking some mobs while holding this shield now and claims that the reduction in damage taken when using this shield is DRASTICALLY noticeable compared to using a 2h or dual wielding while being MT.  <br />
<br />
I am assuming his claims to decreased damage are due to either mitigation or complete avoidance with this shield (so reduced damage per average hit or more misses/parries.)<br />
<br />
Has anyone out there done any recent testing on tanking 1 h with a shield versus a 2h or dual wield.  Can anyone either validate or disprove this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FulorianC</div><div class="date">08-04-2003, 06:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">He gained 75 raw AC, most likely. I'm guessing he used a 0 AC offhand. Thats a huge difference in damage taken.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Razzinel</div><div class="date">08-05-2003, 09:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye, Fulorian, that was my initial guess also.  That shield is 75 ac, plus some additional agi, it may have been just the increase in AC he was noticing.  But since he called it (HUGE difference in mitigation) I decided to check if there is something else to it.<br />
<br />
See the thing is they introduce these uber shieds, and so far to me it looks like the only real use for them is to put them in my magelo to boost my stats . . . what a waste.  (Maybe some limited use as a stat ac/hp boosting item to hold while on rampage ...but that's it.<br />
<br />
This warrior in my guild, does indeed use his shield when rampage tanking and just main tanking. It seems initially it is not a great problem holding aggro on some mobs with 1 h plus furious bash 6 shield.<br />
<br />
Bottom line: if BOW/or dual wield is the way to go and shield plus 1 h has only limited uses than I don't really want one.  I just passed on the Aegis last night sorta just because of that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why don't you have him validate it with some parses?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">08-05-2003, 04:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't see any reason to believe why a 75 AC shield would mitigate any better than adding 75 AC elsewhere.  That said, 75 raw AC is a pretty big chunk of extra mitigation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brudal the Fat</div><div class="date">08-06-2003, 01:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have had Stormriders carapice a while now and never really used it till recently but I can say its an option if you don't have a BoW since they fixed FB focus.<br />
BoC/SRC combo means EB proc is 980 hate + 40% hate increase on bashes.<br />
<br />
BoC/AoE combo means EB proc is 1050 hate + 50% hate increase to bashes.<br />
<br />
The Aegis of Earth is FB 5 not 6 but its a nice shield none the less. A warrior in my guild got one recently and he uses it alot, he also has a BoW and I have seen him use boc/shield over BoW in some encounters.<br />
<br />
Not sure how much a shield blocks hits but I do notice I take less damage tanking using my SRC. That is most likely from only swinging 1 weapon and the ac boost from shield, not the shield itself blocking damage. Just a guess though I have done no parses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Razzinel</div><div class="date">08-06-2003, 03:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aegis also has a 8% plus parry on it shrug...no clue how much this adds, probably minimal.<br />
<br />
We are doing some test but it will take a while before anything definitive is there. <br />
<br />
 Holding agro was not a major problem at some encounters.  He tanked General Reparm in Pofire with an SOD (not even BF) plus Aegis and held agro just fine.</div></div><hr />

Improved damage focuses don't work on DD procs<br />
<br />
Aegis of Earth ONLY glows on bashes<br />
<br />
I agree with the above poster, all available evidence suggests the FB focus has zero effect on EB proc</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brudal the Fat</div><div class="date">08-07-2003, 09:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">no way for me to tell really I guess but if the effect works as it is described in the spell data that would be the values.<br />
<br />
I can certainly tell a difference now than several months ago when I got the shield though as far as agro. Riposte damage I can't really compare much since I wasn't tanking 3k hitters back then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FulorianC</div><div class="date">08-08-2003, 10:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">'Huge' is a term defined by the user. That much AC could give a 'huge' difference in mitigation.<br />
<br />
When I first got my earring, I thought to myself, holy crap, this 8% dodge mod is making me untouchable. <br />
<br />
It wasn't, exactly, but I did see that the dps reduction I was taking was noticable. Combined with the 75 AC, the skill mod on that thing is probably why he notices. I would reccomend he get a Charm of Defense for range and keep DWing though, except on rampage.<br />
<br />
On rampage, no reason to have a weapon at all, if theres some way you can increase your mitigation in any way possible.<br />
<br />
Except for the initial hit of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">08-08-2003, 01:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i simply cant see any purpose to use a shield other than rampage tank.  even BF + Shield, thats a dly 20 weapon verse some slower 2h for less riposte. the time 1her is only exception i guess, but those arent dropping from the sky like rain.</div></div><hr />

Procs aren't considered spells in the strictest sense.  Hand a hybrid a FB shield - ask what happens when they cast a spell.. It glows...  When we proc, it does not.<br />
<br />
As far as the increase in aggro you're seeing, it could be a number of things.. Increased atk upped your dps, your dps classes learned wtf they're doing, the offensive aa... etc.</div></div><hr />

Hmmm, makes me wonder, when call of sky goes of from Orb of the Sky it says I'm casting as spell. Can't test it atm, sold my FB2 shield a while back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Demorgoth</div><div class="date">08-09-2003, 08:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe FB (and all focuses) only works on procs if you have that specific spell in your spellbook</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solinar</div><div class="date">08-11-2003, 09:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Focus' only work if its a player castable spell.  You dont have to personally have the spell scribed, but something like lifedraw proc (a necro spell) can be focused, where something like Enraging Blow (is not a player castable spell) can not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ladas Sindarin</div><div class="date">08-11-2003, 09:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm 99% sure that you have to actually have to be able to cast the spell yourself for a focus item to work, not just be a player castable spell...<br />
<br />
I know my ID4 items dont affect the proc from my Steel Flinted Dagger (Conflageration - wizard spell), but I am almost certain the Light Woodsmans Blade proc (Careless Lighting) was affected, but Careless Lightning is player spell castable by rangers.</div></div><hr />

O'Keil's Radiation (wiz DS) rightclick from VT smithing gloves isn't effected by buff duration on a warrior either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solinar</div><div class="date">08-11-2003, 11:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oops, I stand corrected then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Splaktar</div><div class="date">09-24-2003, 04:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Can any warriors say much about the RZ shield from Time?<br />
<br />
We gave our first one to a Paladin w/ Hopebringer and he can get and hold aggro whenever he wants, over other SK/Pal/War w/ Vanazir, EoE/ED, etc...<br />
<br />
Also gave our last Vanazir to a SK and now he overaggros all the time :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gobbo</div><div class="date">09-24-2003, 07:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, the way its determined if foci work on procs/rclick is whether or not the spell has your class listed in the raw data (lucy).  The aa abilities from PoP used to all be class/lvl1 in raw data - spell foci worked on them - but, they changed it to be none class, and now foci don't work on em. <br />
<br />
Since Enraging Blow has no classes listed, no classes will be able to use a foci on it.  An easy way to fix this would just change it to be warrior/lvl1 - but they may not be able to add spells for war/rog/rog at all.</div></div><hr />
