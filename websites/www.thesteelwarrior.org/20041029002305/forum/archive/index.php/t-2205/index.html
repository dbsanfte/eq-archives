<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cenyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, well, a few of my friends and I were just going to go check out Droga, then i remembered that new Copper Hammer of Striking drops there. So we start clearing from the bottom right Nurga enterance(we were doing small factioning there) and none of us have been to the zone before. I looked at my map, and noticed a few possible places. I heard it was in NE direction, so we pacified to a place that was like a mining central. We decided to stop there because we started late, and it would be rough going anywhere with all the mobs there.<br />

P.S. looking at some other maps(namely this one (http://www.eqmaps.com/m3/droga2.jpg)) i noticed we were at the bottom of goblin city</div></div><hr />
