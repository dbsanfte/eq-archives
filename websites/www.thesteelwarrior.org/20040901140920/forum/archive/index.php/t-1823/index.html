<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aveen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been reviewing some of the ideas that are being tossed around here. It seems that now adays everyone and their dog have *the* fix for warriros. The one thing that VI needs to do that will make it all better for our class.  That is a dangerous route to take since our problems stem more from being left behind in class upgrades. When comming up with ideas, we need to consider how that idea might affect our class as a whole, how it might pigeon-hole us yet again in the future. <br />
<br />
And from that mindset there are some good ideas for ways to improve warriors. However, there is no one thing that alone will fix us.  While the area of agro control certanly seems to be the biggest area that we lack in, if that gets fixed, we will still be the one dimensional tanks that we always were. We will have gained little in the grand scheme of things.  <br />
<br />
Warriors are out of date in today's EQ.  We are the same tanks that we were in Velious, we just have a few more hps now, different weapons for some of us, but the same set of skills and disciplins.  <br />
<br />
While we fight to get our main problem of agro control fixed, keep in mind that we need to continue to come up with ideas to send to the developers to address issues of itemization, outdated skills, and stacking with other warriors in a group and at raids.<br />
<br />
These issues are just as important to makeing the warrior class whole again as getting agro fixed.</div></div><hr />
