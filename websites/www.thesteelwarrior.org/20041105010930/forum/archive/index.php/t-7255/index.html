such a excellent piece of equipment and guess what it drops off?<br />
<br />
&gt;TRASH MOBS&lt;<br />
thats right, just any normal exp group can go to Ferubi and acquire one of these sweet items...<br />
<br />
BTW im trying to get one myself atm, but anyone know the drop rate of this item? I've hunted there for a few hours and no Mantle yet..</div></div><hr />

I don't know what the drop rate is but if I go to Ferubi for a couple hours usually get at least one of them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Darkeeper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Really?  I have been about 5 nights for around 3 hours a night and yet to see one drop.  Either im very unlucky or Duch is Lucky.  Where in the zone do you fight Duch?  Does it always drop off Cadavor's?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Duchess Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Got one the other night in ferubi close to the zone in and I have gotten others close to the zone in too.   They can drop off any random trash it seems</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Darkeeper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">another 4 hours the other night... Fought from Quinimi to Barindu and not 1 drop for the group.  Seems the loot here is rare now.  Anyone know if they made any changes to the loot since the made the zone easier?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Daabu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">They seem to be more common somewhat close to the zone in.  Last night we cleared from Barindu towards smith, and before we spawned the first named we got a mantle.  I've never seen one drop deep in, its usually before the first named trigger (which is near the bridge/water section in the north end of the zone).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>ZajeerSOE</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Just a quick note: Drop rates for items in Gates haven't been changed since release. So that mantle is dropping at the same rate for the last couple of months. It's just somewhat rare :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ernie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thanks Zajeer for the drop rate info :)<br />
<br />
For those of us who are looking to get some exp groups out here to hunt and hope for a mantle drop, any advice (to other players that is)?<br />
<br />
I ran out yesterday just to take a look, zoning in from Quinni (or whatever zone is one in from where the port guy is).  Mobs seemed doable with the front two beating me up in about BoT tower fashion or slightly worse.   A good puller to split mobs up seemed essential, but cleric healing didn't seem absolutly required.<br />
<br />
Anything I should know before trying to drag people out here to slaughter some bad guys?<br />
<br />
A different entrance to the zone was mentioned, where is that?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any help or pointers :)</div></div><hr />

Zajeer squashing myths right and left here.  If you posted more often we wouldn't have anything to argue about ;)</div></div><hr />

      Really false . First 15 day at release they drop much more (and named spamn more often too). Now in 5 raid to Zun'muran votal + many single group to the end of ferubi and we never get one drop . But well it's not normal that a  trash mob drop better loot than tiers3 pop god.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Daabu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Saroumane, are you telling an EQ developer that he's lying?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>saroumane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Yes ,are you surprised ? Like they don't have already done it so many time.......</div></div><hr />

I'm surprised that you'd call a man who helped create the game you are playing a liar when he comes over to your place to clear up myths.<br />
<br />
You can continue to believe that SOE has a hidden agenda and is trying to save face, even after everything that's happened in the past month in SOE's PR...but keep your anti-establishment SOE-hate rants in the outhouse, where people will be happy to treat you the way you are treating others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Thanks for stepping in, Daabu.<br />
<br />
Personally, I love when SOE developers stop by to clarify a point. They're the ones who cleared up taunt, for example.<br />
<br />
Come by any time, Zajeer.</div></div><hr />

Really false...they are completly random and the drop rate hasn't changed since the release of the expansion!<br />
<br />
but you know because you created the game right?</div></div><hr />

Hrmm I think he is referencing enhanced drop rates from previous release (Kunark, Pop etc) and assuming the same was done for GoD.<br />
<br />
I however believe the gentlemen from SoE when he states no such activity took place in GoD.  I believe we owe them that respect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Don't abuse the Sony staff.  If we have to choose between them posting here and a 1-post wonder such as yourself well...</div></div><hr />
