<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Haha and actually typing all the stats on items, making 10 hotkeys to cover all your goods :p<br />
<br />
But really, even when back then I complained about sitting for 2 hrs waiting on someone to pop up and sell a piece of armor, now I kinda miss all that...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Frig Coldheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Man do I remember the EC tunnel auction days hehe...begging for a sow for a cr to WC hehe. Thats another of the things I truly miss from the original EQ days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>rexiant</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">i started playing a few weeks after RoK came out. on drinal it was always north freeport, in the courtyard around the bank. minimize clip plane, look at the ground, and hope i hit the bank before i LD. seeing as there's race/religion/faction-kos npc's all over, it always seemed odd to me that we were centralized in north freeport, while most other servers were in the EC tunnel.<br />

/shout selling everything on me behind the jade!<br />
<br />
/auction WTS banded armor. 2pp per ac PST!!<br />
<br />
running everywhere you wanted to go, hiring druids or wizards, boats, getting in a derv group for the sexy xp, making the big step to oasis and running like hell whenever somebody trained specs or SGs to the dock where all the big kids hung out and waited for the boat, finally getting the oh-so-awesome forest loop, seeing the LoiO-OT-DL-KC progression come into play.<br />
<br />
for how much some things sucked back then, it was more enjoyable in some ways. more of a drown or learn how to swim kind of experience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Venz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I used to spend days at a time looking for a certain item to be up for auction, only to find that the guy selling it wanted way too much, and then spending the next half hour trying to bring his price down =P didnt mind waiting though, the best duels i ever had were in ec ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Redleaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I remember sitting in EC with Phase Spider Caparce on.  I finally made a hotkey in say for the stats because it was a bitch to type every time.  Some weeks I would do nothing but trade, but I usually got what I wanted.  Those were good times, sure the bazaar is easier, but hey, i had time to waste when I was in EC.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Sacrore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I guess I never hit up EC all that much, always bought and sold my stuff in Faymart.  Dont know if that was just a Povar thing or what, but Gfay was the place to be.</div></div><hr />
