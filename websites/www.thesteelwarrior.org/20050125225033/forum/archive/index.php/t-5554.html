I want to get the Myrmidon gloves, for hand.  I sometimes see the glove for around 15k, is that a fair price? As for range I may get  a war bow of Rallos Zok, if I ever sell my Cobalt BP.  There are not too many bows that interest me in Bazaar, anything that give over 60life are over priced.  I see war bow of rallos Zek for around 60k sometimes might buy it.  As for charm I have no idea what to get, some one give me some ideas?<br />

<br />
On a side note, I would a warlord vambrace recently for 4k, it had 33ac 5str 6 sta 2mr 2 poi 25 hp, i thoguth the hp was little low, i then traded it for a helanic vambrace 26 ac 5 sta and 60hp.   I now see warlord vambrace up for sale for like 40k.  I am just wondering if i made a bad trade in terms of value.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">02-05-2004, 02:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is hard to quantify the value of items on FV because most everything is tradeable. On a normal server, 15k for SS gaunts it too high because they are a common drop. Also, we don't get the option of selling the finished product, we are stuck with a no drop, statless item that just takes up bank space. I would try to score some Warlord's Steel Gauntlets (LDoN), Onyx Gauntlets (ToV), or Gauntlets of View (VT). Ideally, you could get Gloves of the Crimson Sigil (VT) but it is unlikely anyone would sell them because of the click effect.<br />
<br />
As far as a range slot, a War Bow of RZ or any elemental player made bow is a nice item to have, just a matter of getting some levels so you can use the elem bows.<br />
<br />
Lastly, the best charm is the PoP charm (Intricate Wooden Figurine) once you get some flags. It's also free, so you can use your plats for other upgrades. Most charms suck ass to begin with so it only takes a few flags to make the PoP charm better than anything else available. I wouldn't worry about it too much for now, once you get 60+ you should be able to get several flags to upgrade your charm.</div></div><hr />

I notice severl people on my server offer to key someone for a fee, and said the person might get a free AA.  Please respond to this post with the best of your ability.

From the items you referred to and the level I am at and the strength of my guild, I would say ToV, VT items are both out.  Warrior steel gauntlet is doable but i need to do a few ldon eastcommon, but maight take many runs and hard ldon is not easy.  In conclusion gauntlet of myrmidon might be cheapest to buy.  As far as Warlord Vambrace for Cultural helanic vambrace, do you think i made a mistake?  difference of 7 AC but gain like about 30 raw life<br />

instead of buying scads of cash on ebay to subsequently spend eq, heh, i would just enjoy the game and level through your gear progressively.  lv 52 with some of the gear youre talking about getting is just sickening (to those on servers with &quot;nodrop&quot; on our stuffs that have played the game for several years).  having uber gear from the get-go is completely pointless if this is your first eq character ever.  if you were an alt of a main thats been around the block a time or 2, it would be different.  all the gear in the world is empty if you dont have the experience/know-how that usually goes along with people geared as such.<br />
<br />
that having been said, if you can get a war bow of rallos zek in the 50k range, it sounds pretty reasonable.   as far as gloves go, myrmidon are great but not stellar.  if the prices on myrmidons are close to the ldon gauntlets, i would go with the ldon gaunts for superior stats.</div></div><hr />
