If you wish to get the conclusions without reading the whole thread, see Post #305 (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?postid=32130#post32130) for a summary of the thread to that point by Arantius.  This testing was motivated by questions posted in this thread (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=1673) which may give you some insight into the early tests which aren't clearly explained.<br />
<br />
Went down to FG with a cleric tonight (tried it with the bot but he got owned by the shroom stuns :p).  Had the cleric pull a mushroom and spend 5 minutes pissing it off...stunned 8 or 10 times, healed herself multiple times, meleed, etc until it was at around 20% health and then I had her turn off attack and stop casting and I tried to taunt it off of her.  I didn't attack at all and hadn't done anything to the mob until this point.<br />
<br />
The result was suprising, here's the log...<br />

<br />
4 successful taunts again.  <br />
<br />
Anybody have any explanation for this?  The only thing I can think of is that we're wrong about how taunt works.  If this is true then my hat is gonna taste mighty bad.  Full log file is attached with some chat channel stuff edited out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">07-07-2003, 09:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well hell.  Could it be that there is a limit to how high a successful taunt will put you?  If highest on the list is above that, maybe just gives you a certain number of hate.  Thats my only guess, I don't believe successful taunts help if you are tank still, but as proven here, we could be wrong.<br />
<br />
If you do another test, using the ranger, would be good to try with him using different a number of snares a few times.  See what the difference is in how many successful taunts to get at the top.  Maybe an sk would be good, to get exact numbers of how much hate he does (assuming the sk uses only terror spells).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Graal the Dorf</div><div class="date">07-07-2003, 10:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Try guards. I've seen that weird behavior with shrooms mentioned here before. Think it was Frodlin? Can't remember.<br />
<br />
Go to West FP and try it on the guards at the zoneline to NFP.<br />
<br />
I'm curious wtf the shrooms are like that though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Adarian</div><div class="date">07-07-2003, 11:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There has always been a cap on the amount of aggro a successful taunt will give. There is even a cap on how much aggro a AE tunt gives. When you get a succesful taunt you get one of 2 things to happen. You get either X aggro or Y aggro where X is enough aggro to put you ahead of the person and is smaller than the cap or you get Y which is the maximum hate taunt will give.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Graal the Dorf</div><div class="date">07-08-2003, 12:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't ever remember hearing anything about a cap Adarion. It wasn't widely known if that's the case. VI never mentioned anything about a max +hate cap from taunt, and it never tested out as having one in the tests back then. Like I said though, that was about 3 years ago.<br />
<br />
That cleric cast sound of force 4 times and either tarnation or enforced reverence 6 times in the first test. That is 10 stuns and 2680 points of spell damage. That's a hell of a lot of hate, but I still would have thought 1 successful taunt would have pulled aggro. <br />
<br />
Maybe testing with an SK would be a good idea. We can find out exactly how much hate the SK +hate spells give, so if there is a cap, would be easy to find out what it is. I would also recommend (if someone is willing) to try different mobs. Anything that speaks that isn't in FG, basically. I can probably do something similar with my wife's shaman and my paladin in an old world zone...but not tonight. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">07-08-2003, 01:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really am hoping it was just the mob, that somehow they are different.  Finding out that everything we thought we knew about taunt is wrong would just be a shock.  Still, better to know than not to know.  Thanks Brutul for doing the test, and passing this information along.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">07-08-2003, 01:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Now that is interesting...never heard of a cap on Taunt tho.  People need to check this on a variety of mobs, not just one type.  I think the fire elementals in SolB respond to Taunt too...I know they respond to Pick pocketing rogues. ^_^<br />
<br />
SK hate spells have a hate increase of 10x the mana cost, easy to figure out how much then.  The SK needs to do some damage first tho, the hate spells don't work as well it seems otherwise.  Someone grab a paladin to help parse this also...maybe we can also find out how much hate is on each stun. ^_^<br />
<br />
If someone wants some help from a 60 SK on Veeshan to do this, give me a tell on one of my characters below, and I'll see what I can do about helping you with my SK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">07-08-2003, 01:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not one to start questioning widely believed theories, but I've always suspected that something like this was going on.<br />
<br />
For example, I double box a warrior and a shaman.  If I pull two mobs, I can take care of one, and my shaman can piss the holy hell out of that second one....Turgur's, Epic, Blood of Saryn and Pox create an unbelievable amount of aggro.   When my mob dies, and the other is around half life, with no DoT's still active on iti'll try to pull it off her. There have been times where I have mashed taunt every time it came up and that mob stayed stuck to Cag until it died.  On the other hand, when we're split tanking mobs and I finish mine first, I can walk over the other warrior's mob, taunt once and pull aggro off all of the damage he's done to that mob, and hold that aggro as well.<br />
<br />
I can't explain it, and like I said, it's not conclusive of anything...I may just fail taunt every time I happen to pull 2 mobs.  Weirder shit has happened.  I'm guessing tho that there's something else going on that we don't know about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varaho</div><div class="date">07-08-2003, 02:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Try in Velious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">07-08-2003, 02:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since even low HP aggro is not infinite, it does not seem unreasonable that taunt or even AE taunt has a limit to how much aggro you can pull.  For one, clearly AE Taunt is never enough to pull it off a low HP aggro, so this implies whatever AE Taunt gives is less than low HP aggro.  Some friends were testing low HP aggro to try to AE mobs in Fire and I think they quoted around 10000 damage of PBAEs being enough damage to peel a mob off someone who's low HP aggro (not sure what this translates to in aggro though).  I have successfully escaped from Sol Ro with 100 HP (from rampage tanking and no one botherng to heal me) which is clearly low HP territory.  Of course, it is very easy for the MT to build a ridiculous amount of aggro on the Sol Ro if you avoid the AEs, which is why I suspect it works.  Sol Ro pretty much won't notice me even if I continue to melee him, but if MT dies then it's instant summon.  So that seems to suggest you can get enough aggro to overcome low HP aggro, though I have never seen that happen in a situation where everyone is attacking at the same time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varaho</div><div class="date">07-08-2003, 04:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wait a min...<br />
<br />
I remember VI saying something about spells having a maximum +hate value based upon the hp of the mob, could it be that they were just lazy and capped the taunt skill like they did spells?<br />
<br />
Someone kidnap a sk, I think it is time to find just how hps effects max aggro per spell! :cool:<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: And I thought low hp aggro was a multiplication and not an addition to your hate value.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valeris</div><div class="date">07-08-2003, 05:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think that the fact that FG mobs are 'messed up' at all suggests that taunt isn't as simple as we had accepted. <br />
<br />
For there to be any form of anomoly from the norm, surely taunt cannot just be a binary equation? how can you mess up a decision that has only two possibilities (taunt or failed taunt) unless there's more too it than that...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">07-08-2003, 07:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well since we know there are at least 2 different agro modes in EQ (undead/rooted and regular, if you will) and taunt is intamately tied to agro there is no reason not to assume that taunt would be simple either.<br />
<br />
Brutul, your test ring true with my impression of the way the messages work. Not that I have anything to back it up at the moement, other than about 4 years of game play.<br />
<br />
Of course it could be something as simple as the assumtion that the verbal responce from the mob does not represent a successful taunt. It could be that mobs are ware of ALL taunts and respond randomly to any taunt message. <br />
<br />
Are there anytimes in your log that you got agro from taunt without a message?<br />
<br />
I have never much gotten into agro theories becuase alot of people run with the assumption that responce = successful taunt and I have never seen that justified.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, I know I'm not Brutul, but I noticed the same sort of crap when I was farming lucid shards in Fungus Grove.  I didn't have my log on or anything, but after 6-7 hours there I don't recall having gotten aggro from a taunt without that message popping up.  Sometimes though, it seemed to put me high enough that when I swung my weapon twice for ~150 it immediately turned to me (although my next taunt was about to refresh at the time).  <br />
<br />
I wish I had a log, but I don't.  So take my experiences with a grain of salt :-P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Surlok</div><div class="date">07-08-2003, 08:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Excellent,Should these tests prove that this occurs in other areas outside of FG ,It further proves how useless That button really is..<br />
<br />
And I was one of those people that had a lot of Faith in it...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunrack</div><div class="date">07-08-2003, 08:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I hate to add this to the lists of I wonder.... But, the fact that agro with taunt as a yes | no would be the simplest thing to do of course and somewhat expected, and I guess even what the community was told how taunt worked?  Is that realistic?  Well, I know we are not talking about other games but please hear me out, as this is true even in the EQ Pencil and Paper game.<br />
<br />
Taunt is nothing but a bluff, it is not real, you are using words or gestures to upset the way an enemy thinks, to somehow make them believe that if they don't kill you first they are in trouble.  When we look at it that way lets now say that the intelligence or fighting &quot;experience&quot; of said mob matters.  They would have a counter check to your bluff that says for example, &quot;Brutul is full of shit the cleric has done all the damage anyways why would I hit him, I'll stick to the cleric.&quot;  This would be completetly true no?  Hence it would take a lot of convincing (multiple successfull taunts) to make that creature think different?<br />
<br />
Before anyone starts calling me stupid please realize these are just ideas, since there seems to be something ominous about the way taunt works.  Aside from this theory there are many others that friends of mine have offered such as:  tuant is CHA based?, taunt is INT based?  Wis Based? there is a counter mob check for realism?  The dummer the mob the more responsive to just taunt?<br />
<br />
Granted is this method of thinking more realistic?  Yes, specially since they've given the oportunity to increase those stats thru AA's, but when things work that way there is usually a skill that improves it, no not AETaunt, more along the lines of (Brutish all your taunt checks will now be based on STR instead of XX skill)  That btw is one of their skills on the pencil and paper version of EQ.  <br />
<br />
Anyways, just thought I'd add my 2 coppers which by no means I say are law just throwing out ideas to the masses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ealsur Helevorn</div><div class="date">07-08-2003, 08:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That btw is one of their skills on the pencil and paper version of EQ.  <br />
<br />
How does taunt work on the pencil and paper version? Maybe that gives us some clue, could you explain if there is not much trouble Gunrack? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">07-08-2003, 08:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As far as I know there have been NO developer statements on taunt that I know of. And I think you have a heck of an idea there that could be a 3rd possiblity of not getting agro on a succesful taunt.<br />
<br />
1) Responce to taunt is independent of success of taunt check.<br />
2) Responce is indicative of a successful taunt but it only adds a flat amount. There for a succesful taunt does not automagically move you to the top of the list.<br />
3) Mobs responced to a successful tuant, but then then get a save.<br />
<br />
Personally I think that taunt adds a random amount to hate. No supporting evidence (yet) but just the way it feels sometimes. <br />
<br />
Gunrack, don't worry about putting up what might be stupid ideas. Look this thread was caused by me asking a noob question about taunt (as a 160 day, 4 year, 63rd warrior). Personally I rathter see all the ideas possible. Even if the idea is seen as completely stupid it may spark some connection in someone else head.</div></div><hr />

Taunt<br />
<br />
Taunting is the art of angering and annoying opponents so that they attack you in preference to all other opponents, even if thats a tactically unwise decision for them.<br />
<br />
Check:  A Taunt check is opposed by the target's Sense Motive check.  Favorable and unfavorable circumstances weigh heavily on the outcome of a tuantcheck.  Four circumstances can work agains the taunter and they are the following<br />
<br />
1. The target is already attacking someone else.<br />
2. The target is of animal intelligence or lower (they don't understand what you said or are deadset on finishing one person off before the next)<br />
3. The target is above animal intelligence but cannot understand the taunter.  (different language etc...)<br />
4. The target realize that attacking the taunter may be tactically unwise.<br />
<br />
Each of these circumstances adds a bonus to the sense motive check of the creature being taunted, as listed below<br />
<br />
Taget's Condition           Bonus<br />
<br />
Attacking someone else  +10<br />
Animal intelligence           +5<br />
Doesn't understand the taunt +5<br />
Tactically unwise              +10<br />
<br />
Taunting is a move action.  A successful Taunt check indicates that the target MIGHT (yes the book says MIGHT) move toward the taunter --- depending on the targets intelligence and ranged attack options --- but certainly focuses all of its attacks on the taunter for 1 round (and possibly longer if it closes to melee).  The target attcks the taunter as intelligently and effectively as it can, but if it knows it cannot attack him, it is likely to ignore the taunt.  Targets affected by more than one character's taunt skill will attack the character who taunted tem most recently.  If the taunter damages a target on the same round he tries to taunt it, he recieves a +5 circumstance bonus to his Taunt check.<br />
<br />
Scenario:  be advised this is based on a D20 system and not 100's and over 300's for stats.<br />
<br />
Karesh, a warrior with Charisma 16 and 8 ranks in Taunt, sees a wolf attacking her wizard companion 75 feet away.  She knows she can't reach the wolf in one round, so she tries to goad the wolf into coming to her instead.  Karesh first fires an arrow at the wolf to get its attention, striking it for 7 points of damage; she then makes a taunt check, rolling a 9 and adding her taunt bonus of +11, and her +5 circumstance bonus for having damaged the wolf this round, for a total of 25.  However, the wolf gains +10 to its sense Motive check because it is already fighting something else, +5 for not understanding Kresh's taunts, and another +5 because its animal intelligence, the GM rolls a 6 on the wolf's sense motive check, so, with its +20 bonus (and +1 for its wisdom score), it gets a total of 27.  The wolf keeps attacking the wizard.  If karesh had rolled an 11 or higher, the wolf would have turned to attack her isntead, most likely for the remainder of the combat (unless it were then taunted by someone else).<br />

Given this posted test of taunt...maybe a /bug should be submitted about it. Clarification of taunt skill being changed again would be nice...while they are looking at warrior issues ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aethor</div><div class="date">07-08-2003, 09:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can confirm it. 65 Sk here, browsing boards due to boredom...<br />
<br />
Anyhow. Last week we killed the Arch Lich, and at the time two of our best warriors weren't online. Now, we do tank him with SKs and paladins as well, but we wanted to use a warrior so that the warriors who were there get some practice.<br />
<br />
After clearing other snakes in AL room,  everyone was medding/rebuffing in the corner behind the pillar as needed, I went to the beginning of the ramp and started chain casting two best agro spells I have (but only those spells that won't damage the mob so it doesn't go into summon mode before we want it).<br />
<br />
I casted it for something like 5 to 8 minutes. We had 3 warriors at the time, and two of them were very new - one was actually a potential recruit, completely untested, so the raid leader decided to put them all in MT lineup to see how will they behave. <br />
<br />
At least one of them does not have AE taunt for sure, I don't know about other two.<br />
<br />
The last on MT list was then told to go to AL and not attack at all, just to click taunt repeatedly until he gets hit, then to run back to us. I stopped casting, and I had built insane agro at the time.  (Imagine a SK chaincasting agro for 8 minutes without stopping and without doing anything else) He did as he was told, voila, he got (insane agro) + 1.<br />
<br />
Then I continued for another 3-5 min and the second warrior in MT line was told to do the same, now he had (insane agro * 1.5) + 1<br />
<br />
Then I continued building agro.<br />
<br />
Then the first MT was told to do the same, with the exception that he wasn't supposed to run back, but continue attacking and we started on AL... he had (insane agro)*2 + 1.<br />
<br />
Yes, taunt worked in all 3 cases. And I had sufficient agro built to break any possible limit or cap there is - which means there isn't one.<br />
<br />
After that, the warrior who was first MT had AL simply glued to him for the rest of the fight. He didn't die - we have set the MT order up just in case, to be 100 percent sure who gets next agro, this is why they were taunting and running away.<br />
<br />
The agro on MT didn't move for one single moment.<br />
<br />
Note that it usually wasn't enough to click taunt once - they were clicking it till they got hit by AL, it took some amount of clicking, but at the end they were able to start the fight with an amount of agro that allows them to keep the mob on them regardless of what do their weapons proc, or not proc at all.<br />

That would confirm the findings made by Brutul rather than the opposite.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">07-08-2003, 09:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's interesting Aethor.  Although it could have had something to do with distance to the mob. <br />
<br />
Of course it could be something as simple as the assumtion that the verbal responce from the mob does not represent a successful taunt. It could be that mobs are ware of ALL taunts and respond randomly to any taunt message. <br />
<br />
Are there anytimes in your log that you got agro from taunt without a message?<br />
<br />
I have never much gotten into agro theories becuase alot of people run with the assumption that responce = successful taunt and I have never seen that justified.<br />
<br />
I would bet a large amount of cash that message = successful taunt.  Up until last night I have always been absolutely confident that I had aggro after a successful taunt.  I have grouped with other tanks and hybrids and seen mobs turn on them like clockwork after seeing their name in the &quot;I'll teach you to interfere&quot; message.  The main difference last night is that I am not usually *that* far behind anyone in my group on aggro. <br />
<br />
As far as I know there have been NO developer statements on taunt that I know of. And I think you have a heck of an idea there that could be a 3rd possiblity of not getting agro on a succesful taunt.<br />
<br />
<br />
There was a developer statement on taunt and they said it worked as we have explained it does on this board (moves you to the top of the hate list if successful).<br />
<br />
1) Responce to taunt is independent of success of taunt check.<br />
2) Responce is indicative of a successful taunt but it only adds a flat amount. There for a succesful taunt does not automagically move you to the top of the list.<br />
3) Mobs responced to a successful tuant, but then then get a save.<br />
<br />
<br />
My bet would be #2.  Taunt moves you to the top of the hate list, as the developers told us it did long ago, but perhaps there is a maximum amount of hate you can get from a successful taunt.<br />
<br />
Wait a min...<br />
<br />
I remember VI saying something about spells having a maximum +hate value based upon the hp of the mob, could it be that they were just lazy and capped the taunt skill like they did spells?<br />
<br />
Another interesting thought.  That could explain Aethor's anecdote.<br />
<br />
Would definitely like to get some more tests done on this subject now.  Anyone that knows of some good &quot;talking&quot; mobs that have enough hitpoints that they could take a few stuns from my cleric but not tough enough that they will kill him before he can get decent aggro built up would be appreciated.  I have a raid tonight but if it's not to late when it gets over I will give some freeport guards a try afterwards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khazzuz</div><div class="date">07-08-2003, 09:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've always wondered why I had a taunt &quot;skill&quot; that went up with my lvls.  If taunt were based totally upon the RNG and a pass/fail system, wouldn't this make my skill in the ability superfluous?  This thread go me thinking that a taunt skill would work and make sense if tuanting actually added an amount of hate, with your &quot;skill&quot; being the modifier, much like increasing your skill in defense will increase your AC.  With that in mind perhaps the results of taunt could be broken into three categories.<br />
<br />
1.  Taunt failure - self explanatory<br />
2.  Taunt success - a fixed amount of hate is added, this acquired through a base amount determined by your lvl + an amount determined by your taunting skill.<br />
3.  Critical taunt - you are automatically moved to the top of the aggro list.  <br />
<br />
Anyways, just a thought.  Good thread so far, thanks for the original post Brutul.  I sure hope this doesn't mean I'm gonna have to go back to mashing my taunt button though......<br />

<br />
More than likely there is a cap, which is lame. Probably an artifact of pre-Kunark programming that didn't take into account the huge amounts of hate that can be generated now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aethor</div><div class="date">07-08-2003, 10:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If there was a cap then the warriors in my story from above would NEVER be able to gain the agro.<br />
<br />
The fact that one or more taunt clicks eventually gets them the agro confirms that taunt has no cap, it simply works or not, semirandom (random but the distribution of success-failure is adjusted by your level in taunt skill).<br />
<br />
Note also that on a successful taunt, you get highest current agro + 1. But +1 is a very small amount; actually, almost anything can outagro it. So this is just a chance for taunter to build on it by his melee damage, and agro procs, and in case of hybrids also by spells.<br />
<br />
In case that  the person who had the highest agro the moment before does something that generates more than your +1 (and +your melee damage), and that really isn't much, any spell will do, he will gain agro again.<br />
<br />
On a previous mob in said Rhag cycle, it was Rhag1 or 2, I can't remember right now, I did not FD after MT had agro. As a result, the agro list was as follows:<br />
<br />
MT warrior (insane agro)*2 +1<br />
<br />
Agro builder (SK) (myself) (insane agro)*2<br />
<br />
MT #2 (insane agro)*1.5 + 1<br />
<br />
MT #3 (insane agro) + 1<br />
<br />
then a long long gap<br />
<br />
then everyone else, debuffers, nukers, healers, assorted melee.<br />
<br />
So the MT had only 1 advantage over me, but an enormous advantage over everyone else. I did not attack for a while even when others did, I wanted to give him time to build more of a difference with weapons and procs (I think he has Braid of golden hair and PoI hammer) and then when I started attacking, with 52/46 weapon and nuking and dotting in parallel, I got the agro soon... Eventually I FDed to get rid of it. The agro returned to MT.<br />
<br />
After coupla FDs to make it sure, I dumped the agro (a successful FD has a chance to move you to bottom of agro list, on mobs under level 30 it wipes you off agro list, on higher level mobs it just moves you to the bottom, but it is just a chance so FD needs to be repeated).<br />
<br />
On AL I FDed right when the MT got agro, and I repeated FD several times, so we had the 3 mentioned warriors in agro line. (A consequence of the entire setup was that the clerics knew exactly if MT dies who is next on agro with 100 percent certainty, they could literally set up hotkeys for specific MTs and just click them).<br />
<br />
As far as mob hp is concerned, AL is far above any normal group exp mob... and taunt over agro works in exp groups every time.<br />
<br />
Sometimes I tank in an exp group, sometimes I pull and a warrior tanks, FD is handy for this... and to tell you frankly I got tired of tanking.<br />
<br />
If it is at all possible, my system with pulling is to pull with snare, add coupla more agro spells as the mob is coming. Slowers can slow the mob before it even comes to the camp, and if the mob resists slow, they can just reslow again. If there is sufficient space, they can recast slow several times. The mob goes on me, warrior clicks taunt till it works. Yes, the healer has to heal me for a while, but healing me is hell of a lot easier than to heal a shaman or God forbid to heal a chanter that a mob is aggroed on. If I would FD the agro would simply jump to the slower, if I don't, the warrior taunts the mob till taunt works, then we have him and me on agro list before the casters - so even when MT dies, tanking continues without problems.<br />
<br />
However, what happens often is that I get agro back too easily. A number of warriors have weapons that have a taunt proc even if their dmg/dly is fairly low... and if the proc doesn't go off soon, my 52/46 with massive damage bonus gets the agro. Or I dot the mob.. actually I drop 2 or 3 dots of 1k each to increase the dps. Warrior taunts, he gets agro, next tick the dot kicks in...  hi agro again.<br />

What he is saying is that if a successful taunt adds a maximum amount of hate, no matter how far behind you were, you could catch up with enough successful taunts.  On the AL you have no way of knowing whether your taunt was successful but you did say they had to taunt a few times.  They could have made multiple successful taunts to get it off of you.</div></div><hr />

I suppose if you can show me where SoE came out and said &quot;taunt skill affects your success rate,&quot; I'll be happy to eat my words.  I was just brainstorming other ideas how taunt could work, and barring a direct statement from SoE as to how taunt works, the idea I presented could possibly be just as viable.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aethor</div><div class="date">07-08-2003, 10:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm but then if a successful taunt adds a fixed amount, how did warrior MTs in exp groups, after they taunt the mob I pull off of me, sometimes, right after successfully taking agro, lose the agro when I make just a hit or two with two-hander?<br />
<br />
Then that fixed amount of agro is very low... or the entire system works in some other way...?<br />
<br />
However, I have some possible explanations for your experiment with the cleric.<br />
<br />
Spells produce agro. Spells also need time to cast. If the cleric casted something (like a nuke or stun) on the mob, in mid-cast you taunted and you got agro but then the spell lanted in next second... the mob turns back to him.<br />
<br />
Note in your log that at first the cleric was casting after you taunted, then he remember that he shouldn't cast.<br />
<br />
What about healing? If he healed himself, the healing itself produces agro...<br />
<br />
The entire log looks to me (I might be wrong however) as if the cleric produced agro right after your taunt... or at the same time, although after the initial &quot;forgot no casting&quot; and &quot;I ducked&quot; there isn't anything about him casting...  what about heal over time spells? Damage shields (cleric MoK/MoR spells)? How would they affect agro?<br />

<br />
Perhaps the taunt skill affects which MOB LEVEL you can successfully taunt, while success/failure rate is purely random?<br />
<br />
Has anyone ever parsed success/failure of taunt? Haven't seen anything like that on SK boards, though warriors are more likely to experiment and parse such a thing.<br />

<br />
As someone who didn't know to put a point into taunt until level 20, I can tell you that yes, taunt skill does indeed affect your success rate. The thing is, your skill scales up at the same rate as the mobs ability to shrug it off. Consider weapons skills. If you keep them capped every level, your chance to hit an even con mob stays basically the same from level 10-65. As anyone that has suddenly gotten a new weapon that uses an untrained skill can tell you, weapon skill does indeed affect your hit rate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I am suggesting that based on Brutul's findings there may be a maximum amount of aggro per successful taunt that one can gain.<br />
<br />
<br />
In other words: Taunt gives you x+y hate when it is successful. Also,  x=&lt;z, where z is the maximum amount of aggro allowed to be gained based on some unknown formula that may use the targets max hp as a variable. y is an unknown quantity of a value to small to accurately measure or use as a &quot;buffer zone&quot; yet big enough to signify that the person that used taunt has more aggro than anyone else.<br />
<br />
Ok so maybe that is hard to understand :p<br />
<br />
taunt=x+(1) x=&lt;z</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gimmel</div><div class="date">07-08-2003, 12:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">And if that is true, there needs to be a whole lot of /bug and /feedback going on until it is fixed.</div></div><hr />

Always having taunt maxed would make it appear to you that your chances are always the same, basically your chances of taunting an even con mob remain proportional no matter what lvl you are, assuming the skill is maxed.  For some reason that just doesn't make me feel any better.  Honestly, what's the point of having the skill then if success rate will always be the same?  They could have just tied success rate directly to your lvl only.  Seems just to be further proof that SoE really fucked up this taunt thing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seru guards give a taunt message too, and I was in there the other night fighting sigriendi of the hand or whatever they're called (the report dropping ones) ... and they'd give their just-taunted messages without turning on the tank a lot.<br />
<br />
And the same thing happened back in Splitpaw when I was younger. You'd get the message but the mob wouldn't turn.<br />
<br />
Maybe it's not the SKILL that's broken ... maybe it's the text/script or NPC?<br />

Most people have always said to taunt 2 or 3 times to ensure you have aggro when u release it...but maybe instead of a single success, there are more than one simply adding to each other.<br />
<br />
Absolutely no way to prove it...but something that just popped to mind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valeris</div><div class="date">07-08-2003, 02:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another possibility, perhaps taunt is supposed to stay 'behind the scenes' until such time as you reach the head of the aggro list at which point the aggro message is generated. If some mobs' script (such as FG 'shrooms) is bugged so that successful taunts that don't cap the aggro list ALSO generate a taunt message......<br />
<br />
If taunt stays fairly regular then the taunt skill itself might be a  measure of how quickly you can leapfrog up the aggro list.....<br />
<br />
Not sure how the relative difference in aggro between raid and Exp grouping might factor into this, perhaps in the case of the AL example the proximity aggro was great enough to give the warrior a leg up....?</div></div><hr />

Taunt skill as the 'range' from which a success can boost you to the top - if outside that range you are boosted X% up the list....<br />
as mentioned above  perhaps a 'critical' taunt success would take you to the top from wherever you are.<br />
<br />
Very very hard to prove such a theory though :p</div></div><hr />

Perhaps there's some significance to the fact that the mob generated the same number of taunt 'successes' before you gained control....<br />
<br />
Totally speculative, but perhaps this difference indicates a 'fix' during Luclin to a taunt aggro cap....</div></div><hr />

<br />
IMHO I think that &quot;taunt&quot; is a set of business logic on the server side.  I also think that over time this logic has turned into spaghetti with all the &quot;exception cases&quot; being added such as &quot;low health agro&quot;, &quot;PoP agro behaviour&quot; etc.  I'm pretty sure that some of this logic conflicts strangely with other pieces giving us some rather interesting results.<br />
<br />
I also think a Sony/verant/whoever the doer ant developer needs to pull this whole mess of crap out and rationalize it with who ever does their &quot;business analysis&quot;...i.e the keeper of the set of rules on how this whole thing is supposed to work.  Odds are they havent done that in quite awhile and what you are seeing with the shrooms etc are &quot;holes&quot; being caused by this spaghetti.<br />

<br />
I don't think that this can be true.  I remember fighting in Kael arena one night ... I was the MT, and we had 2 incoming ... one of the other warriors off-tanked the add, while the rest of the party killed the mob I was tanking.  After my mob was dead I ran over to the other mob ... it was at approx 75% health ... I taunted it exactly 1 time ... it immediately spun around on me and I had aggro for the rest of the fight.<br />
<br />
If taunt could add only a maximum amount of aggro, then I don't see how it's possible I could have gained aggro with just 1 taunt ... 25% health is just way to much hate to overcome if there was indeed a cap.<br />
<br />
Besides, hasn't Verant/SOE posted at least twice on Caster's Realm that a successful taunt automatically puts you to the top of the hate list?  Or are we saying that taunt no longer works the way it used to in the past?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Uhh, your logic is flawed there pal.<br />
<br />
Brutul was trying to taunt a shroom with 20% of it's HP remaining, and noticed that he couldn't gain aggro.  You got aggro off a giant at 75% health.  That doesn't mean that taunt doesn't have a cap..it means that if there is one, it exists at some point between those 2 figures.</div></div><hr />

You can test this as much as you like but the poh clerics will give you that message everytime you press taunt.

<br />
Raw &quot;hate&quot; is NOT the only component of mob aggro focus... if taunt is only putting you nominally higher on the hate list than someone else, that might not be enough to overcome other components of aggro (no faction on shrooms, but range IS a factor, could be dot heals or similar too).<br />
<br />
Suggest repeating the test with a few variables, like having the cleric move away out of melee range (i.e. run a bit) while the warrior follows closely and taunts.  Also make sure no beneficial dot-type spells are active, etc.<br />
<br />
I've noticed similar effects in other places, when taunting mobs prior to them being mezzed... without swatting the mob a few times after (successful) taunts it's tough to lock aggro sometimes.<br />
<br />
Just an idea.<br />

I'm simply stating that 25% of a Kael Arena giant's health is more aggro than could reasonably be expected to be overcome with 1 use of taunt if there was indeed some sort of cap.  25% in this case is quite a lot of aggro.<br />
<br />
Granted, this example is certainly an example of a very lucky roll by the RNG.<br />
<br />
If the cap were greater than this number then why have a cap at all?  How big would the cap have to be to make it so that it's not possible to successfuly taunt a mob with only 1 taunt?  If there was a cap, how many times would Aethor's warriors have to taunt to overcome 8 minutes of aggro generation by the SK?<br />
<br />
Aethor's post is an excellent example of how there simply cannot be a cap on taunt.<br />
<br />
Also, Verant/SOE have in the past told us how taunt works and they didn't mention a cap.  Why do you think there is a cap now?<br />
<br />
Brutul was trying to taunt a shroom with 20% of it's HP remaining, and noticed that he couldn't gain aggro <br />
<br />
Incorrect.  What he reported was having to taunt it multiple times before he gained aggro.  In both cases he presented he had to taunt 4 times, each time apparently a successful taunt, before the mob turned and attacked him.  Why 4?  Was it random?  Did it take 4 presses to generate enough aggro to actually become #1 on the hate list?<br />
<br />
What can explain this behavior?<br />
<br />
A taunt cap.  Yes, but other behaviors of taunt indicate that this is probably not the case.  See my example above.  See Aethor's example.  I'm sure others have their own examples.  Also, taunt has been explained to us by SOE and no cap is mentioned.<br />
<br />
Taunt being dependant somehow on aggro differential.  The bigger the aggro differential between the warrior and the person on the top of the hate list, the less chance of success the warrior has to successfully taunt.  Thus we have warriors who can overcome 25% health on a Kael Arena giant because they get lucky on the RNG, but normally it might take 4-6 taunt presses before aggro is gained.  This would also explain why it is usually relatively easy to get aggro back instantly after a slow lands.<br />
<br />
There may be other options, but my experience leads me to believe aggro differential does indeed play a part in taunt success.</div></div><hr />

The shrooms reported 'successful' taunts only on a certain number of taunt attempts,  it took four 'successes' each time to draw aggro. <br />

I'm not sure how a bug could differentiate between 'successful' and 'unsuccessful' taunts when displaying a message, if the script was a straightforward error like the clerics in hate that'd make sense, but why the variance?</div></div><hr />

The entire log looks to me (I might be wrong however) as if the cleric produced agro right after your taunt... or at the same time, although after the initial &quot;forgot no casting&quot; and &quot;I ducked&quot; there isn't anything about him casting...  what about heal over time spells? Damage shields (cleric MoK/MoR spells)? How would they affect agro? <br />
<br />
She didn't cast, melee, or do anything to cause aggro after I started taunting.  She did start to cast a heal on herself, but then remembered she wasn't supposed to and ducked it off before it landed (you can see the &quot;Tavari's spell is interrupted!&quot; message in the log).  No HoT's, DoTs, MoK or MoR spells were active while I was taunting. Besides that she was just standing there.  Clerics don't have riposte so no chance of damage from that, and it would have showed up in the log.  We were pretty much exactly the same distance from the mob...she was standing there with the mob hitting her, I was behind the shroom in melee range taunting.  <br />
<br />
We weren't real scientific on exactly how much aggro she built up, and you can't even really tell in the log because she stunned a few times while she was pulling that were out of range for my log to pick up.  She told me to attack on the 2nd one after she thought she had done pretty much the same amount of aggro as the first.  I'm guessing the stuns were about the same, because she used all damage stuns and the health was about the same, but she was meleeing with a proc hammer, so that could have made a difference.  All in all though, aggro should have been about the same on both shrooms.  The fact that both turned on the 4th successful taunt seems to indicate that as well.<br />
<br />
Right now I'm guessing that Varaho is right.  Successful taunt does put you at the top of the aggro list, but there is a maximum amount of hate you can gain from 1 taunt, so if the distance to the top of the aggro list is greater than that max value, then it just adds the max value instead.  <br />
<br />
I have an idea for a test tonight that should tell us something about the amount of aggro and hopefully will debunk the &quot;adds a fixed amount of aggro&quot; theory.  Man I almost want to ditch raids tonight just to play around with this some more lol.  Feel free to post any more questions about the test or go run a similar test yourself.  Any data we can get on this is helpful.</div></div><hr />

After that point, it seems that if I lose aggro again, one or at the most two taunts is sufficient to regain aggro.  This, as we all know, results in the dreaded ping pong effect =)  One taunt or so will continue to bring the mob back to me, rarely is it more.  <br />
<br />
Perhaps this is something to pay attention too that would support the theory of taunt building aggro at a set amount, with a 'critical' taunt possible that would automatically gain aggro.  Perhaps I'm stretching and this doesn't happen as consistently as I believe, or just happens to me, but either way I'm curious if anyone else has noticed this.<br />

<br />
I think this is the best theory we have going right now. It makes a lot of sense that a warrior has a smaller chance of a sucessful taunt when another player has built up a substantial amount of aggro.<br />
<br />
For example (And I made these numbers up completely). If a mob has not been aggroed then taunt has a 90 percent success rate. If a mob has between 1 and 1000 Hate on it from another player then taunt has an 80 percent success rate. 1000 to 3000 Hate, 50 percent. 3000 to 5000, 30 percent. 5000 plus, only 10 percent.<br />
<br />
These numbers are of course made up but I can see Sony using a model smiliar to this. <br />
<br />
We have one easy way to test this. Get a 63 SK with Terror of Thule (600 Hate) and parse how sucessful taunt is in relation to how many times the spell landed. <br />
<br />
Personally I think a sucessful taunt is based on 1) Taunt Skill and 2) The difference in Hate between you and the person at the top of the aggro list. and 3) Level of mob in relation to you.<br />
<br />
Sony assigns numbers to everything, hate is no exception. We know the exact numbers that TB and EB give. We do not know the exact numbers of a shammy's slow, a necro's dot, or a rangers snare etc...<br />
<br />
With the AL anecdote earlier, I am curious to see how many taunts it took the MT to get aggro. 3? 5? 10?</div></div><hr />

No, see, this is an opinion, not a fact.  You can't prove that 25% of a giant's health is more aggro than 1 taunt could pull.  In fact, there is no evidence at all to support this claim since you've done it.  You're assuming that there is no cap because of this, and your argument is based upon this assumption.<br />

Could it be possible that each successful taunt is not adding a fixed amount of agro, but by the time the 4th taunt comes around the agro from the cleric has decayed enough that it is now inrange of a successful taunt?</div></div><hr />

Here's the test I said I would post to prove that taunt isn't a fixed amount of aggro.  Went to freeport to visit our good friend Guard Effel.  Neither my warrior or Cleric are kos there which makes this easier.  I aggroed Senor Effel with taunt (notice he doesn't aggro on the first taunt with no message.  I pulled him to the zone and sat there ducking and mashing taunt until I got low on health. I did no damage to him whatsoever with either character.<br />

96 taunts<br />
<br />
63 'I'll teach you to interfere with me Brutul.' messages<br />

As you can see, after 63 successful taunts, 1 CH pulled the mob right off of me.  This shows pretty clearly that taunt is not a fixed aggro value and if it adds any amount of aggro it is insignifigant.<br />

In half a dozen taunts on freeport guards, none have aggroed without the interfere message, and every one that has aggroed gave the interfere message.  A small data set I know, but I'll do more.  This seems like an easy test to me.  From personal experience I strongly believe that the message indicates a successful taunt at least on most mobs.  If you can post a log of a &quot;talking&quot; mob aggroing without the message or giving a message without aggroing without a large aggro difference and no message, please post it.<br />

The only way to reliably test this is on non-kos, non-aggro mobs.  Of course clearing aggro after each successful taunt makes this kind of a pita.</div></div><hr />

Back to your mad crazy theorizing about this whacked, hard to figure out skill.<br />
<br />
I now lean towards the stance that the skill has just been torn up, rebuilt, torn up and rebuilt so many times through the different expansions that it's hard to figure out how it will react. The spaghetti theory, or for the more scholarly inclined, the Taunt SuperSTRING theory. :P<br />
<br />
Makes me long for the olden days, of Derv 2 in North Ro, where all four dervs came ... the tank held aggro by a thread, and we all just barely made it out alive. Those were the days.</div></div><hr />

Not trying to cause more difficulty but looking at the test brought some more ideas to mind, a couple more things that need to be possibly looked into.  <br />
<br />
IF the amount of taunt is a fixed value, and IF that value eventually is capped (have heard that idea tossed around here)  the test doesn't disprove that fact if CH creates more hate than your taunt cap.  I think I explained that well enough....<br />
<br />
I guess I'm suggesting you try casting other spells on the mob or you, ones that maybe create lesser aggro than a CH, which does happen to piss a mob off quite a bit.  That way, if it were capped you would possibly be able to define the area where it was.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">07-08-2003, 11:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Something occured to me.<br />
<br />
I'll try to get my point across as clearly as possible, but I know I'm going to mess up.  I'm not going to bother with success rates, that's another thing, but something occured to me.  Someone mentioned how a developer came and actually said &quot;a successful taunt puts you at top of agro list + 1&quot;.  But if that was true, then something else is wrong with Brutal's first test.  <br />
<br />
Verant (and SOE) assigns numbers to EVERYTHING.  The meditate skill for casters seems odd, because it's not a chance for success...if you're sitting, and you have a skill in meditate, you're medding.  Simple as that.  The thing is a certain skill in Meditate adds a certain amount of mana per tick.  (The general idea I've found is that every 10 points of meditate adds 1 more mana per tick)<br />
<br />
Now, we don't actually know how much hate is added for any spell, with the exception of those that actually say &quot;XXXX hate increase&quot; (e.g. the Terror line of SKs, and the Taunting/Enraging blow weapons).<br />
<br />
The general idea for Taunt is that a higher skill means a higher chance of success.  Also, that a successful taunt means you are instantly at the top of the agro list +1.  This sounds painfully familiar to anyone?  Anyone know anything else in this game that, in essence, maxes you out in something?<br />
<br />
Complete Healing<br />
<br />
When I first started this game, I didn't know about Lucy or Allakhazams or anything like that.  I only believed that CH took your max hp and current hp into account and healed you however many hp it takes to &quot;completely heal&quot; you.  I found out later that it's nothing so elegant...the spell doesn't take your max hp into account at all...it just healed you for up to 10,000 hp, making it, at the time, a complete heal.<br />
<br />
How does this have anything to do with Taunt?  Think about this.  Since Complete Healing heals you up to 10,000hp...you can say that &quot;it heals you for 10,000hp, or 100% of your hp, whichever is lower&quot;.  It's been lowered to 7,500hp, but the equation remains the same.  This can even be applied to incomplete heals for druids and shaman.  &quot;It heals you for 3,000hp (druid) or 2,000hp (shaman), or 75% of your hp, whichever is lower.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now, given an arbitrary number for a max amount of hate added from Taunt of 10,000hate, just pulled this out of my ass.<br />
<br />
Any chance that the Taunt skill could add 10,000hate on a success, or agro+1, whichever is lower?  The amount of hate added would have to be fairly high, high enough so in most cases a successful Taunt should put you at agro+1 anyways.  But the Taunt skill will never actually put you higher than agro+1, that's why more successful Taunts without anyone actually going higher on the list than you first do nothing (only Taunt when you DON'T have agro).  This explains Brutal's latest test.  He never did more than just get on the agro list with a successful Taunt (agro+1)...no one else was on it, and he never did one point of damage.  Taunt will never give enough agro to go higher than agro+1, obviously, so all those successful taunts never added agro because the equation can't give more than agro+1, which he was already at.<br />
<br />
So what does this tell us...no idea.  For all I know, my brain just came up with a theory that just happens to fit the facts.  Here's the short version.<br />
<br />
Complete Healing started at 10,000hp healed...as they never figured anyone would ever get more than 10,000hp to be healed for.  It was, for all intents and purposes, a complete heal with a very simple method of doing it.<br />
<br />
For all we know, Taunt could give a huge amount of hate (even higher than we think), so in most cases Taunt gives us agro+1 on a success.  It's only in cases coming out now, after the agro list changes and the fact that people can now generate insane agro from spells, that we might realize that taunt literally only adds a certain amount of hate up to agro+1. (i.e. Taunt is like a Complete Heal...adds a huge amount of hate, only up to the top of the agro list.  The problem is, if the amount it gives doesn't give you agro+1, it only raises you up that pre-determined amount, which, like the &quot;new&quot; Complete Heal, isn't always max.)<br />
<br />
Okay, now that it's on here, the next part of my speech.<br />
<br />
Remember I mentioned the Meditate skill?  It's a skill that &quot;succeeds&quot; every tick as long as you're sitting for the entire tick.  For all I know (very hard to test since the interval is 6 seconds, and we don't have a number to go by) Meditate might be checked against if you weren't sitting the entire time.  But anyways, the point was that the ratio is 1 mana for every 10 skill in Meditate (this might be arbitrary too).<br />
<br />
Taunt skill might determine your success (probably does, but I didn't train Taunt on my SK until about 40s...never needed it, Taunt did well enough as it was and spells gave me agro I needed), but it might also determine the max amount of hate added (Have no way to prove it, and it would be pretty hard, and this whole second theory was pretty much pulled out of my ass about 10 min ago).<br />
<br />
Anyways, just some things to chew on.  We don't know how much hate a stun adds, nor a slow or anything.  There might also be a hate lead cap, where the highest person cannot be more than a certain amount of hate over the next highest person.  While this would make things a lot harder, remember they changed how agro works recently, so if that existed, it might have been removed.<br />
<br />
My head hurts, I'm going to sleep.</div></div><hr />

I just don't understand this one.  The mob was on me (had just taunted off the cleric).  Cleric turns on attack and does 9 damage to him and it goes back to him and takes Four....that's right, our favorite number FOUR &quot;I'll teach you to interfere with me&quot; message taunts to get it back on me. OK WTF?  The only thing I can make from this is that the message really doesn't mean a successful taunt, so it was time to do some testing on that.  <br />
<br />
(log is attached, not much suprising in it except what I quoted above and the fact that it takes VERY little to get a mob back off of you after you have taunted off someone.  I could get the mob back on the cleric by doing 10-15 melee damage and nothing else.  If taunt adds aggro, it is a tiny tiny amount.</div></div><hr />

60+ guards taunted in All 3 freeport zones and North and South Qeynos.  No mob EVER aggroed without the &quot;interfere&quot; message...no mob gave the message without aggroing.  Seems pretty clear to me that that message = successful taunt.  I can't explain the previous post though.<br />
<br />
Here's the log...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">07-09-2003, 12:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Then a guildmate sends me a tell with an idea that maybe aggro decays quickly after it is gotten.  He makes a pretty good case for it that I'm not going to go into, so we decided to test it.  Stun the crap out of the mob (10 times with the level 5 stun) taunt off of the cleric and he zones out.  Sit there tanking the mob and getting no aggro for 6 or 8 minutes.  Zone the cleric back in and CH the  tank, stun 5 or 6 times and finally get aggro.  Back up a few steps and he goes back to the tank.  Stun one more time and he runs over to the cleric.  So much for the decaying aggro theory.  But we got another data point.<br />

Nothing new here, our favorite number, 4 &quot;interfere&quot; taunts to get it off of him.  Pretty impressive number of failed taunts in a row on this one hehe.<br />

<br />
Here is a question about taunt and Gordon Wrinn's reply from Sony's boards ca. April 26, 2000: (http://eq.crgaming.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=1390)  <br />
<br />
<br />
Source: Everquest Gameplay Forum.<br />
<br />
I am posing a question here for all the classes to respond to. Should the cap for taunt be raised for all the taunt capable classes? (War, SK, Pal, Rang). I think it should be raised. With the new more powerful spells, increased skill caps (offense/weapon skill), new weapons with high taunt factors, and the new disciplines, the taunting classes are going to have a hellacious time keeping anything on them.<br />
<br />
The skill level associated with taunt interacts with your level to determine how likely the taunt is to be successful.  It does not control the level of success.  A successful taunt will always make the creature shift to you, assuming that it can be taunted (Yes, some creatures are untauntable). <br />
Taunt makes a creature hate you just a little bit more than it hates the next guy on the list.  In other words, multiple successful taunts, or taunting a creature that is already attacking you doesn't do anything extra. <br />
<br />
I hope that clears up how Taunt works. <br />
<br />
- Gordon<br />
 <br />
<br />
Hanadan (Solinar) has done a test in CoD demonstrating that taunt generates top hate + some amount between something like 90 and 170 (the value of the two cleric nukes he tested) -- he suggests it's actually 2xlevel, so 130 for 65s. <br />
<br />
Gordon's reply says some mobs can't be taunted; maybe others are taunt resistant. He mentions between an interaction between skill level and player level, but it's hard not to think mob level plays a role too.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what to make of Brutul's results. I guess we certainly didn't know what we thought we knew about taunt. The recurrent pattern of 4 &quot;successful&quot; taunt messages before getting aggro is a little scary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">07-09-2003, 07:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I hate to throw another spanner in to the works...but 2 questions:<br />
<br />
1) Are we fairly confident that guard agro is the same as normal mob agro? (I don't remember anything about guard behavior being different from when I was XPing off them, but good to ask..)<br />
<br />
2) Either Gordon is wrong, or the whole premis of messages = success is wrong. I am quite willing to believe that Gordon is wrong (and I think that Brutul's agro guard test goes a long way to showing that message = success on most mobs). Heck by now (and maybe even by the time Gordon wrote that) I bet that there is no one who knows how taunt works. Until some dev hand walks though the code (again). <br />
<br />
Thanks for the work Brutul. And yet again my beleife that there are NO stupid questions is reinforced.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">07-09-2003, 08:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nice testing...I think other classes need to read this, if nothing else than to realize that this is the only way Warriors can get agro over them, and that it simply doesn't work as well as we thought.  Also to see those streaks of Taunt failures, ouch.  Took 7 taunts (42 seconds minimum) in your first original test to get agro, and 6 (36 seconds minimum) in the second...from a 65 Warrior with, most likely, 230 skill in Taunt.  If Taunt doesn't put you on the top of the agro list on a success, that's an explanation...if it DOES everytime, then Taunt really does suck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kaledan</div><div class="date">07-09-2003, 08:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One thing that coud explain these tests is if:<br />
<br />
AGGRO = HATE + BONUS<br />
<br />
where HATE is the stored hate, what's normally referred to as the hate list, and BONUSes are fixed values for various conditions such as being close, low health, low level, the current target, etc.<br />
<br />
If the cleric starts off with 3923 HATE and a BONUS of 3 (perhaps due to them being 3 levels lower?),  then after the first successful taunt the warrior would have higher HATE (i.e. 3924) but still lower total AGGRO.<br />
<br />
The next successful taunt would set the warriors hate to above the highest entry in the hate list.  This is 3924, so the warriors HATE becomes 3925. This repeats until the warrior has enough HATE to overcome the BONUS and gain AGGRO.<br />
<br />
If this theory is right, a higher level cleric would require less successful taunts to gain the mob's attention, and a lower level cleric would require more. A sitting cleric would require a lot of taunts, but it would still eventually happen.<br />
<br />
Soru</div></div><hr />

One thing that coud explain these tests is if:<br />
<br />
AGGRO = HATE + BONUS  <br />
<br />
That's making a lot of sense.<br />
<br />
In his tests, Brutul is (quite correctly) focusing purely on Taunt.  However, I'd agree that the Hate list is definitely not the only factor in which target a critter will select; it's merely one factor in a behaviour algorithm which also includes proximity and low hp aggro, target invulnerability, and possibly several other factors as well.<br />
<br />
Taunt might well put the warrior at the top of the Hate list; but, I theorise that critters show a tendency to continue to attack their most recent target if the amount of Hate is within a few points.<br />
<br />
Suggested experiment to test this:-<br />
<br />
Have the cleric act as before to gain aggro, then the warrior taunts until there is one successful taunt message.  The cleric then hits DA and goes invulnerable.<br />
<br />
The subject will certainly attack the warrior.  What interests me is what will happen when DA wears off... if we're just dealing with a tendency to attack the most recent target when the hate lists are roughly equal, then the subject will stay on the warrior even after DA expires.  If we're dealing with an overall taunt cap, then it will switch back to the cleric.<br />
<br />
Second theory:  Where the hate lists are roughly equal, critters show a tendency to attack whatever has hit them most recently.<br />
<br />
Suggested experiment to test this:-<br />
<br />
Have the warrior taunt until one successful taunt indicator, and then kick the critter once.  See if the kick causes it to switch targets without any more taunts.<br />

Several times I got into a situation where the cleric would get hit but if he backed up a few steps the mob would go back to hitting the warrior.  If the cleric got close again, he would get hit again.  This was very repeatable and it was clear that distance to the mob was the only factor in whether the cleric got hit or not.  He only had to move a very small amount to flip the mob back and forth.  This is a factor that is very hard to control in these tests and may explain some anomalies.</div></div><hr />

(In my oppinion only)<br />
there is an Aggro limit. its very real and easy to  see.<br />
<br />
before the aoe taunt came around remeber tank switching?<br />
<br />
tanks beats the hell out of mob procing like mad  and 2.5 min later you try to taunt it off.. you really think you failed taunt 10 times?<br />
<br />
No the warrior was at the max taunt limit. and he had to turn off attack to lose aggro. Took another 62+ warrior a good 45 sec of taunting and procing to peel doomshade off of me (i know i know.. but thats the best place to practice it for later) without me attacking.<br />
<br />
hate also seems to be a decaying value. So when you finally taunted that mob off that cleric it was becasue his aggro had faded. 1 hit was all i took to get him back on top.<br />
<br />
we have all seen this.. slow resisted 4-5 times and no taunting will get you on top of the list if he continues to cast. Hell aoe taunt even fails somtimes but i thinks thats more of a bug.<br />
<br />
If there is a hard capped number, say 10,000 (probably more but lets say it is this)  and you taunt you get top of aggro list +1 making it 10,001. as the top of aggro is capped at 10,000 a taunt making you 10001 fails. This includes aoe taunt if the memwipe fails (assuming it reduces others hate or somthing along that line)<br />
<br />
low hp aggro must be 10,000 hate as well. Seeing as people said that sometimes low hp aggro is not absolute.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think my last test shows pretty clearly that aggro doesn't decay. I'm repeating myself, but after building aggro with the cleric and taunting it off (did zero damage or any taunt-building stuff whatsoever with the warrior...taunt only, and I was ducking to avoid any damage from ripostes).  Then the cleric zoned out and back in to clear his aggro.  The warrior sat there tanking the mob while ducked and doing absolutely nothing to the mob for something like 7 minutes.  Then I attacked the mob with the cleric meleeing for a while...didn't get aggro.  Then I CH'd the tank....didn't get aggro.  To finally get aggro I had to cast stun on the mob something like 6 times in addition to the CH and the melee.  I think it's pretty clear that the aggro the tank got from taunting off of the cleric (the ONLY thing he did to get aggro) had not decayed in the 7 minutes since he got it.<br />
<br />
Your tank switching example is simplistic at best.  Taunt is only one of many factors in aggro when everyone is attacking and has been for a few minutes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At the time of these test, Farlander was 65th level I believe as was I.  I am a ranger btw, Farlander is a warrior, and Samanthea was a 60 something cleric.  We went to FG because the shrooms respond.<br />
<br />
I do not recall seeing any of the 4 succesful taunt behavior in order to get agro during these two tests, and the others we did relating to archery agro.<br />
<br />
Anyway here's the tests.<br />
-------------------------------------<br />
Objective:<br />
Attempt to determine if taunt only puts you on the top of the hate list, or it adds additional agro besides that of moving you to the top of the hate list.<br />
<br />
Test 1:<br />
Process:<br />
I snare a mushroom 20 times. 10 tangling weeds, 10 snares.<br />
Farlander to taunt until the mushroom responds, that way we can determine the difference in behavior if taunt fails<br />
<br />
Result:<br />
I snared 10 shots of tangling weeds, and 10 shots of ensnare, Samanthea kept me healed with some HoTs to try and remove her agro from the test.<br />
<br />
Farlander taunted once after I was finished snaring, the Mushroom responded to the taunt, and Farlander got agro.<br />
<br />
Test 2:<br />
Process:<br />
Farlander will taunt 20 times, then I will snare.<br />
<br />
Result:<br />
Farlander had to go defensive so he could get off 25 taunt attempts, on 14 taunts the Mushroom responded so we assumed that meant 14 taunts worked.<br />
<br />
I snared and had agro.<br />

Was Farlander closer to the mob than you were?  I think that may be the key here.  With a successful taunt while not meleeing, both characters have exactly the same aggro so the mob attacks whichever person is closest to it.  Or possibly it takes 4 times whatever small amount of aggro that is added by a successful taunt to overcome a slight difference in distance from the mob.<br />

I think that once you get out of melee range, distance doesn't play as dramatic of a role comparitively. <br />
<br />
You could also move the toons closer and farther away and see how much space it takes to get the mob to switch targets.<br />
<br />
I've had a theory for a while about absolute hate and effective hate, which I've talked about here before. We don't know if the taunt skill works off of effective hate or absolute hate. You could test that also by using 2 warriors and a cleric. Have the cleric stun multiple times with the &quot;Stun&quot; spell (cheap, no damage). Have warrior 1 taunt the mob from the cleric until he gets aggro. Root the mob, have both the warrior and cleric back up a decent distance from the mob. Now have warrior2 go up and taunt the mob while the warrior and the cleric are some distance away. Have everyone move to the same distance away from the mob, /assist to find which player is the mobs target. If taunt works off of effective hate instead of absolute hate, warrior2 will not be the target when he is the same distance from the mob as warrior1.</div></div><hr />

Sk casts 1 agro spell, warrior taunts untill he gets agro (both of them not meleeing or doing anything else). Do it a few times and see how many taunts it takes.<br />
<br />
Then the SK casts the same spell 2 times, warrior taunts untill he gets agro (both of them not meleeing or doing anything else). Do it a few times and see how many taunts it takes.<br />
<br />
This could figure out what the maximum taunt cap is (if there is infact one) because if you don't get agro right after one sucessful taunt (read:if the mob gives a message, although the messages may be broken) then you have reached the cap.<br />

I was farther away than Farlander in both tests, iirc.<br />
<br />
Distance does play a large role in agro, especially when you are a ranger PL'ing a chanter.  The chanter had to run through me quite often to ditch mobs on me, otherwise they'd stay agro'd on her regardless of how many snares I threw on them.<br />
<br />
In fact the whole PL'ing experience makes me believe that there is a difference between damage agro and non-damage agro.<br />
<br />
.... more random thoughts....<br />
Remember the spike agro issue that came in when they extended the hate list?  Well they fixed that, but that fix came after the testing I did and before the testing Brutal did.  I don't wonder if they broke something when they fixed that problem.<br />
<br />
<br />
Agro decay...  Brutal's test is not conclusive but definately a strong indicator that agro doesn't fade over time.  However there is some agro fade going on in xp groups.  Remember before horses and all outdoor zones?  Back then clerics were not supposed to heal and then instantly sit or they would pull agro.  I believe they had to wait a few seconds and then sit.  So there was some agro fading going on there.  In fact I still see that behavior nowadays if I nuke during the pull, and then sit right after losing agro to switch out spells.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is not an indication of aggro decay, all it means is that someone else has more time to gain a larger amount of hate if you don't sit down immediately. That's very easy to test too. Have a cleric pull aggro by CHing, then have someone taunt off of the cleric without any attacking or doing anything else to increase aggro. Wait several minutes and then have the cleric sit down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flair</div><div class="date">07-09-2003, 11:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">FYI guys this is a brillant thread.<br />
<br />
Any chance that the Taunt skill could add 10,000hate on a success, or agro+1, whichever is lower? The amount of hate added would have to be fairly high, high enough so in most cases a successful Taunt should put you at agro+1 anyways. But the Taunt skill will never actually put you higher than agro+1, that's why more successful Taunts without anyone actually going higher on the list than you first do nothing (only Taunt when you DON'T have agro). This explains Brutal's latest test. He never did more than just get on the agro list with a successful Taunt (agro+1)...no one else was on it, and he never did one point of damage. Taunt will never give enough agro to go higher than agro+1, obviously, so all those successful taunts never added agro because the equation can't give more than agro+1, which he was already at. <br />
<br />
Putting on my technical hat I'd say this has a pile of merit.  I would expect that they implemented this in a similar way to other processes.  I mean knowing what we know about where Verant was 3 years ago would they have had time/money to develop complex logic?  No they would have stuck to a similar design.  I also think they went with the simplest design possible that yielded the highest performance in terms of throughput.  I think that is described up above.<br />
<br />
<br />
If what has been stated above is true (darn nice work Bruutal) I think that server logic calculates +/- agro values and complies them onto an aggregate &quot;agro bucket&quot; database value.   It does this fairly inelegantly so as not to cause performance issues.<br />
<br />
<br />
Concept: &quot;Agro Decay&quot; <br />
If &quot;agro decay&quot; (the idea that agro fades over time) exists then:<br />
<br />
1. The bucket gets dumped periodically (very possible if data is cached for performance reasons)<br />
2. The bucket gets reset (i.e values older than X stop going into aggregate &quot;or sum&quot; logic for the &quot;agro bucket value&quot;)<br />
<br />
Thinking that performance was their #1 concern I'm guessing its option 1.<br />
<br />
Taunt &quot;Spaghetti&quot; <br />
<br />
Was just brainstorming all the agro/taunt changes since day 1.<br />
- Proximity changed<br />
- Agro given to procs changed<br />
- Actual taunt skill changed<br />
- Addition of EB weapons (direct hate add) added<br />
- DA chars removed from agro list<br />
- Facing agro changed<br />
- Spell agro changed<br />
- Addition of AE taunt<br />
- Tuning of AE taunt<br />
- Changing of how root agro works<br />
<br />
etc all.  Just something additional to chew on.  As hard as folks have worked on pareses its only as good as the soundness of the logic below it.  I think the 4  taunt-Agro thing is an artifact of a bug.  Just my opinion mind you ;-)<br />
<br />
Regarding the experiment <br />
<br />
You've gotten a pile of armchair quarterbacking but have you considered facing agro (i.e run experiement with you and cleric on opposite sides).  Proximity and facing agro != the same thing.</div></div><hr />

This shows pretty clearly that taunt is not a fixed aggro value and if it adds any amount of aggro it is insignifigant.<br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I wouldn't say this is necessarily true.  It's long been determined that taunt does nothing if you already hold aggro on the mob.  There may be code such that if you don't have agro, a taunt adds hate, but if you do than it adds nothing.  So it's possible your first taunt had a fixed aggro value that put you at the top of the hate list, and once there your next 62 taunts add no more value because the mob was already on you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, there are still people who insist that this isn't true and really believe that a successful taunt is +100 aggro or some such.  The purpose of the test was really to put that argument to bed finally.  <br />
<br />
Although some of these results on these tests weren't what was expected, there hasn't been anything that indicates that it's a good idea to mindlessly mash the taunt button while you already have aggro, so I think that we were right about that at least.<br />
<br />
EDIT:  I would buy Frodlin's theory about mashing on raids where there's a lot of clerics, wizards, etc gaining aggro from a distance.  I can't say whether it's true or not, but it makes sense.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The 4 taunt thing that Brutal has documented 3 times now is either a bug in the taunt code, or a bug/misunderstanding of the taunt response we see the guards and the shrooms make.  Or they have decided to change the way taunt works and decided not to tell us, or forgot to include it in some patch notes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flair</div><div class="date">07-09-2003, 02:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The actual taunt itself or the message? <br />
<br />
What you see at the user interface is not the bug...its the symptom of the bug.  To answer yer question though I'd say its the taunt process itself...I personally think the messages are just eye candy (/shrug just my opinion)<br />
<br />
More specfically I think the bug is the combination of logic that produces the outcome you are seeing at the EQ interface level (taunt x4 giving agro).  I can't comment on what exactly the bug is without seeing the code; snow balls chance in hell of that happening.  But my instinct tells me that when I see a process that is giving a consistent, spurious, REPEATABLE (which Brutal has shown) and inexplicable result that usually there IS a conflict at some point...you'd be amazed how something as simple as forgetting to close a loop or a single case statement can cause these things.  And I think we all have a list in our heads of just how many &quot;custom&quot; alterations to taunt/agro have been made over the years.<br />
<br />
Again all just my opinion and I can be dead wrong.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I belive it takes you 4  taunts to actually have mob turn on you maybe because cleric agro + 1 thing. Mobs still know somehow that cleric is the real pisser and not you. and you need her agro + 4 to get it off cleric. I bet you if you taunted and lets say punched or kicked a mob a few times you would have goten agro right away. If not then there is got to be a limit how much agro sucessfull taunt adds. I actually noticed something quiet similar when tanking on raids where we have EB wielding warriors (no eb here) it usually very hard for me to pill shit off them after proc takes 2-3 taunts at least.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Another thing to consider re: the original post...is it possible that the cleric might have had any kind of regen or heal-over-time effects on? Let's say that taunt actually does put you at top aggro + 1, then the very next tick of any heal spell would likely supersede taunt. Depending on the mob (and it's been a long time, but don't shrooms spend more time casting than meleeing?) it's possible that the warrior could have lost aggro to a heal by the time the mob is ready to melee again.<br />
<br />
I'd try it with 100% melee mobs, maybe in the old world, kunark, or even Velious. Those are less likely to have weird additional responses.<br />
<br />
Shrug...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">07-09-2003, 04:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One thing that kinda caught my attention in all this is that all the tests have been done at a high level of hate.  Might be worth trying arun with a lower level.  Say taunt guard to agro, pull to position, have cleric CH you(should be enough I would think to pull agro away), then see how many &quot;I will teach you...&quot; messages you get before regaining agro.  I am wondering if that, at very high levels of hate, there might not be a cap to hate of some sort, possibly do to coding limits(not a programmer, but do know that different variable types allow different max values...something like that maybe?) causing a bug to affect taunt.  Also, as has been mentioned, it could be that taunt will only raise you a certain fixed amount max, and you are exceeding that amount.<br />
<br />
Lots of questions raised by these tests, some great work Brutul, and some great theorizing by everyone else.  I find this whole thread kind of exciting, as we maybe will learn some important things about taunt, and agro.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daramin</div><div class="date">07-09-2003, 04:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm wondering if the problem is &quot;real&quot; agro vs &quot;taunt&quot; agro. In the tests you showed Brutul, you had no agro other than from taunting. I agree that testing a single kick or punch would be useful -- it'll show that there's an interaction between have some agro vs having only taunt agro.<br />
<br />
I'd also do something like punch/bash to start the fight, then let the cleric stun for 5 minutes, then taunt and see how many it takes to get the mob off the cleric. We know the agro you had won't decay in those 5 minutes (your test proved that at least 7 minutes isn't long enough for agro to be decay/wipe), so if you get the mob hitting you faster than the magic number of '4' taunts, then it'll be because of your previous agro.<br />
<br />
Personally I don't believe that there is a cap on agro to taunt. This is only anecdotal, but it's happened to me many times now. Most of you probably know the Burrower Beast even in the Deep. On one wave of this ring event, you get six pretty heft mobs spawn. These mobs are tank mezzed by 5 tank mezzers and the raid kills them sequentially (at least that's how we do it).<br />
<br />
I have been the MT for this raid a number of times, and have found that I have about a 50% chance of getting agro off the tank mezzer immediately upon taunting. In some cases the Burrower Beast was down to 30% of its health by the time I got to it, yet I was still able to taunt it onto myself immediately.<br />
<br />
What I *wasn't* doing, obviously, was hitting taunt and then just standing there. I had attack on, so I was generating agro of my own above and beyond taunt.<br />
<br />
I've also had the experience in plenty of xp groups and raids where I forgot to turn attack on and held agro with just taunt / kick / disarm. I would pull agro off the debuffers with taunt, later a rogue gets agro, I taunt, they evade, and the mob is on me again. I've gone whole fights with attack off and had the mob on me 80% of the time just from taunt.<br />
<br />
This 4 number is very scary, I agree. It indicates something strange is going on that we don't understand. But I've *seen* taunt work, in situations that are similar but not exactly the same to the controlled tests that have been run here.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This quote put one thought into mind.  I know that as recently as last night, taunt *seemed* to work normally.  Goofing around in BoT with friends, had no problem with taunt not working, and maybe twice needed as many as 4 taunts to regain agro.  With that in mind, figuring out where the tests differ from normal situations could be important.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1 - This is undocumented, but SKs feel that pure aggro effects (EB, taunt, SK terror spells) doesn't cause as much aggro if you are not on the hate list already. So if I pull with a terror spell then use a debuff or DoT for aggro, I get less aggro than if I used the DoT or debuff to pull then cast the hate spell.  Consider turning on attack for a round or two of melee, THEN taunting to see if it makes a difference, or start to attack after the first successful taunt.<br />
<br />
2 - I suspect proximity or level might have a factor in this as well.  Consider using a level 1 warrior sacrifice to try and taunt off the cleric (without knowing the difference in levels if any between the cleric and warrior).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">07-09-2003, 10:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since people keep bringing up decaying aggro, guess I'll put in a test I did.  This is quoted from my guild boards and originally posted on 3 / 28 / 03.  Doesn't really have to do with Brutul's tests, but decaying aggro is being brought up a lot.<br />
<br />
&quot;Last night after raiding I was bored like usual. While pondering what to do, I remembered that the previous night, A_guildie had aggro'd Niblek to pull him to the zone in so I could turn in for my VP key. While she was standing there, Niblek suddenly deaggro'd and became indiff again. So I decided to test this for myself.<br />
<br />
My first test was very simple. I went to west freeport and used taunt on a snake. I had removed my damage shield, and faced the wall so I wouldn't riposte the snake. I looked at the time when I aggro'd him, then just sat there waiting. After 10 minutes of doing nothing to the snake, he deaggro'd and became indiff again.<br />
<br />
Now, for my next test, I wanted to see if duration of debuffs effects the aggro wipe. So I went to north freeport and to a guard that regards me as an ally. I equiped my ToD and attacked him. After spending a min beating on him enough that he even had to heal a few times my ToD proc'd. The ToD proc is Tepid Deeds, 50% slow for 3.3 minutes. I stopped attacking immediately and faced away again. I checked the time then proceeded to watch. After 3.3 minutes my slow wore off as expected. I waited and 10 minutes after my initial proc, he deaggro'd and was ally again. So the fact that I had more aggro this time, and that he had been debuffed for a time did not lengthen the time he was aggro. It's 10 minutes after last active aggro.<br />
<br />
Another interesting note. In every test, 7 minutes after last active aggro I would get the aggro message again. I'm unsure whether this is significant or not.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sorry for slight derail.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If the &quot;multiple successful taunts to get aggro back&quot; thing only applies to someone who's got a colossal hate lead then it's one thing.<br />
<br />
With apologies to Brutul for implying another round of taunt tests, I'd be very interested to know whether this effect cuts in at a noticeable, lower level.<br />
<br />
Like, say, when the aggro holder gets enough hate to move the mob.  Knowing whether the type of mob, or having other melees engaged on the mob has a noticeable effect would be interesting too.<br />
<br />
But this would take a lot of tests to work out I guess.</div></div><hr />

It seems that taunting before damaging the mob has no effect for some reason, will have to experiment with that.<br />

<br />
A couple thoughts.<br />
<br />
Taunt was in Original EQ, We know that at the time there were many hard caps built into the system 32k hps, 10k CH's, 255 stats... all of these have since been eliminated, why do we not think that maybe AGGRO/HATE had a hard cap?<br />
<br />
The original explanation that it put you at the top of the hate list is kind of vague. keeping lists in a computer program can be done several ways, the aggro list is by far one of the most confusing ones it seems. <br />
<br />
Even SoE doesnt realive what happens to it when they change stuff. What I find strange is that Lucy can give us the hate values of EB/Terror, but none for any other spell. <br />
<br />
With all the changes to taunt/aggro I to believe there is a huge spagetti logic involved that is causing these anomalies.<br />
<br />
I honestly believe that there is probably no one left who wrote the original aggro code, and that no one there fully understands its implementation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 <br />
<br />
Not completely sure about this, If rooted ALWAYS gave aggro to closest, why would rooted mobs sometimes summon, even when engaged in melee? just something I noticed in PoS other day.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No rooted mobs just attack the closest target, that does not mean the closest person is highest on agro list and mobs will still summon people who are higher on agro then the closest person.<br />
<br />
Rooting for &quot;agro&quot; is really only rooting for &quot;proximity&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">07-10-2003, 09:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Obviously testing taunt on a rooted mob would be totally meaningless hehe.  No they weren't rooted.<br />
<br />
And yes I made a point of making sure I was far behind on the aggro list.  In a normal experience group, no one would ever get that far ahead of the tank in aggro, but the original intent of my test was to prove that a successful taunt could overcome any amount of aggro.  It appears that I proved myself wrong on this one hehe. <br />
<br />
The &quot;forgetting&quot; thing is interesting.  From what I have seen, I would bet that aggro doesn't decay slowly, but after a certain time they may just mem-blur themselves.<br />
<br />
Took a break from parsing last night to actually play the game :).  I do have some more tests to run though.  I want to try it with fewer stuns.  I want to try standing very close to the mob.  I want to try hitting the mob before doing the stuns so I'm on the &quot;real&quot; aggro list.<br />
<br />
Got a raid tonight but I may have time to run a couple tests afterwards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Braeorn</div><div class="date">07-10-2003, 10:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Man, I don't think Haas's tests are derailing at all, thought they were excellent. So either agro decays over time, or wipes complete given a certain lenght of time.<br />
<br />
It'd be interesting to see how long it wears off given different types of agg. It the time is consistent irrespective of the type of DoT, debuff, etc, I'd say it doesnt decay but wipes complete. <br />
<br />
Here's a couple of tests that could help determine the answer (again, using haas's face away no riposte method)<br />
<br />
All to indiff or better:<br />
1 Snared mob<br />
2 Dotted mob<br />
3 Debuffed Mob<br />
4 mezzed mob<br />
5 Meleed mob<br />
<br />
If times are consistently the same across spell types and mellee, then we could conclude it wipes...if different, then decay would seem applicable.<br />
<br />
Great stuff Haas and Brutal</div></div><hr />

All these guards con the same, in many cases it was the same guard, but sometimes they aggro on the first taunt, sometimes it takes 6 or more taunts.  There is no explanation for this that I can think of other than a failure or success on taunt.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gazze</div><div class="date">07-10-2003, 03:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I want to state what I have learned so far.  I will only refer to the evidence provided by the Brutul logs.<br />
<br />
1.  When taunting a &quot;talking&quot; mob.  A successful taunt will always result in a verbal response from the mob.  Even tho the mob may continue to attack the original target.  <br />
<br />
2.  A &quot;talking&quot; mob will always give a verbal response when switching its target.<br />
<br />
3.  When taunting a &quot;talking&quot; mob, an unsuccessful taunt is ignored by the mob and is manifest in the log by no verbal response from it.<br />
<br />
4.  A successful taunt may put us at the top of the Hate list, but does not necessarily gain aggro. <br />
<br />
5.  Based on Brutul trials at this time, it always takes no more and no less than FOUR successful (based on &quot;talking&quot; mob responses) taunts to gain aggro from a cleric which has fully engaged a mob.<br />
<br />
6.  There has been no instance shown to date where Brutul has taunted a  &quot;talking&quot; mob for aggro without the mob giving a verbal response. <br />
<br />
<br />
Factors that affect aggro...<br />
A.  Sit<br />
B.  Health<br />
C.  Proximity<br />
D.  Root<br />
<br />
<br />
In order to limit the number of variables in a trial should you keep all of the above (and others I didn't list) the same for both the cleric and the warrior?<br />
<br />
In the test Brutul ran where the cleric has aggro, Brutul taunts off, cleric zones out, cleric zones in, cleric casts CH and stuns a few before finally getting aggro back.  My guess is that particular test is invalid unless the cleric is the same distance from the guard as Brutul because the proximity factor comes into play and the mob could be making a save against changing targets.  <br />
<br />
Idea...<br />
Go thru the freeport gaurd trial again, with a twist.  Cleric gets aggro.  Brutul will taunt it off.  We expect that it will take Brutul 4 successful taunts to gain the aggro.  Warrior_2 comes over to taunt the guard off Brutul.  <br />
<br />
1.  Can Warrior_2 pull aggro with a single kick?<br />
2.  Can Warrior_2 pull aggro with a single slash?<br />
3.   When Warrior_2 taunts...will the result be the same as for Brutul (takes 4 successful taunts to get aggro)?<br />
4.  If Warrior_2 gets aggro with single kick or slash,  how many taunts will it take for Brutul to regain aggro?<br />
5.  If Warrior_2 gets aggro with only taunt, how many taunts will it take Brutul to regain aggro?<br />
<br />
Stay tuned....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">07-10-2003, 03:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just to clarify some things about my test.  First test I had very little aggro, second test I had a ton of aggro, both mem wiped after 10 mins.  So it seems obvious to me that taunt doesn't decay really, mobs just remove you from their hate list if you haven't done anything negative to them in 10 mins.  Note that on one I did debuff the mob, but the length of the debuff did not add on to the length of time before removal from the hate list.  That is to say, at Time A my debuff landed, and I stopped doing anything negative to the mob.  The debuff lasted until Time A plus duration of the debuff (Time A + 3.3mins).  The mem wipe came at Time A + 10 mins, the exact same as without the debuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">07-10-2003, 03:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">. My guess is that particular test is invalid unless the cleric is the same distance from the guard as Brutul because the proximity factor comes into play and the mob could be making a save against changing targets.<br />
<br />
The cleric was standing right next to me while casting CH/stuns, in fact before going to spells I started with meleeing, so obviously the cleric was right there.  After he initially got aggro I backed him up and the mob went back to the warrior.  One more stun and the mob ran to the cleric.  Proximity is only a factor if there is a relatively small differential in hate.  If one character is significantly higher on the hate list, the mob will go to them no matter how far away they are (within spell-casting range at least).  <br />
<br />
Regardless, I don't see how a difference in distance would make this an invalid test.   If the warrior's aggro had decayed the mob would come to the cleric with very little aggro, regardless of distance to the mob, certainly less than a CH and 5 stuns.  On the &quot;96 taunt&quot; test the cleric was much further away from the mob than the warrior....near max CH range.....and the mob made a bee-line for the cleric after one heal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">07-10-2003, 03:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What I find strange is that Lucy can give us the hate values of EB/Terror, but none for any other spell. <br />
<br />
The reason for that is: with EB / Terror line the hate is the actual effect of the spell.  Whereas with other spells, the hate is a side effect of it.  Lucy only gives us the actual effect of the spell, not effects that are secondary.<br />
<br />
I remember a few patchs ago, they made a statement that mobs will no longer FORGET the people they hate. Maybe the forgetting is a bug left in still? <br />
<br />
What that was about, iirc, is that mobs had a maximum number of people they could have on their hate list.  Once a person more than the max aggro'd them, they would forget the person the furthest distance from the mob.  This means that rangers could be at long range and do their nice dps without even being on the hate list.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dakkin</div><div class="date">07-10-2003, 09:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been trying to work out how a tank can only taunt off a colossally aggroed cleric by getting 4 successful taunts.<br />
<br />
The obvious explanation is that it's hard coded that way.<br />
<br />
If there's a hate cap and your cleric's at it, then 4 taunts would have to lower him and anyone else on the hate list down (say) several thousand hate points and put you at the top of the hate list, so that acquiring and losing hate could proceed again as normal.<br />
<br />
The only way I could think of to test this conclusively would involve paladins:<br />
<br />
Paly One stuns mob 15 x, from range so no heals needed.<br />
<br />
Paly Two taunts 4 x to get aggro then stuns another 15 x.<br />
<br />
Paly One zones and comes back.<br />
<br />
Does it take Paly One 30+ stuns to get aggro back?  If not, hate is hard capped.<br />
<br />
Looks fairly airtight to me, but relies on getting a couple of suitable crash test dummies (sorry, paladins) to test it out.<br />
<br />
Now, another question:<br />
<br />
Yesterday, a cleric mistimed his complete heal and went low hp.  Two of us turned round and tried to taunt off him at once, and I got aggro back in two taunts.  Frankly I was surprised, I expected to see a successful heal to get him back over 40% or cleric puree all over the floor.<br />
<br />
Purely circumstantial, possibly a one-off and I don't have the resources to test it myself, but I was wondering if:<br />
<br />
1)  4 taunts will get aggro back off someone with low hp hate.<br />
<br />
2)  Whether these 4 taunts all have to come from the same person.<br />
<br />
/crawls back into his hole.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">07-10-2003, 10:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Umm you are introducing another factor there too. Warriors have the highest taunt skill. Not that it invalitadates the test, but its another factor to consider. Its possible that the magic number may be something other than 4...<br />
<br />
And another thing that has been cludged onto agro/hate--rampage. <br />
<br />
LOL I think we are going to need a summery thread to go along with this the working thread.<br />
<br />
Gazze #3) has some exceptions--not proven in logs (yet) but widely accepted that some mobs will respond to all taunts, successful or not. (Clerics of Innoruuk for example.) I don't think your level of certanty on that is quite justified yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gazze</div><div class="date">07-10-2003, 11:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dakkin,<br />
I think it is safe to say that the &quot;4 taunt rule&quot; does not apply in a combat situation because so many other factors are coming into play.  The &quot;4 taunt rule&quot; only comes into play when the taunter has not put out any other type of damage.  Once you begin dealing out the damage from a group...there are so many factors involved with Hate and Aggro...you'll never sort it out.  Which is why Brutul's test is trying to get taunt down to the bare bones.</div></div><hr />

The fact that taunt is capped is blatantly obvious to anyone who has been fighting &quot;mem blurring&quot; mobs in earth/air who dont actually mem blur.. they only remove the top person from the hate list.

<br />
Me anda Paladin friend went to Freeport, both max KoS to militia, level 65.<br />
<br />
I aggroed a guard and pulled him without hitting him, and let my friend stun it a few times.<br />
<br />
2 stuns, I hit taunt, guard shouts and turns on me.<br />
Then again, with 8 stuns, I hit taunt and nothing happens (fails) but the guard wont shout either like happened to Brutul, then I hit taunt once more and the guard shouts and turns on me.<br />
<br />
Those results are all normal, however as we were about to complete our test something happened.<br />
<br />
As we started killing the guard, my friend taunted it and the guard shouted at him, but did not turn.<br />
<br />
As soon as that happened we both turned off attack and tried again, same result, the mob shouted but didnt turn off me.<br />
<br />
Now we all know Paladin taunt is capped lower than Warrior taunt, which brings the possibility that max hate generated by taunt is capped by skill level, two things to consider on this one are that a. I wasnt much higher on the hate list than him, and b. hardly 1 minute passed for him to lose aggro.<br />
<br />
Sadly, most of the last part of the experiment wasnt logged and we didnt have time to do it again, but there still is a lead in there.<br />

I taunted off low hp hate yesterday.<br />
<br />
This is interesting (if not a fluke).  The circumstances are irrelevant.  The fact that it happened IS relevant and very important since we all thought it was impossible.<br />
<br />
I think it would be even more interesting for someone to test this to see if it's reproducible under controlled circumstances, and whether under these circumstances it needs, again, 4 taunts.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">landrain</div><div class="date">07-11-2003, 09:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am really of the impression that Hate is capped at 32,000/16,000 somewhere. Solely because that is the design of the variables when EQ was created. If this is the case then, there are questions.<br />
<br />
Does a successful taunt give a max hate mod? possibly 8000 hate? <br />
<br />
if so that would explain the 4 no more / no less taunts to get from no-aggro to top of aggro list.<br />
<br />
Also, another question, what happens when two people occupy the same hate value? and if  someone is capped hate, can he ever loose aggro?<br />
<br />
Also does hate decay? It seems to me that it must, else in a long fight if there is a hate cap, then eventually everyone will be at max hate.<br />
<br />
I do not think the test with the KOS guards would  give same results, i think it needs to be done with non-kos or even ally to test effectively. As KOS i belive gives an initial value of hate to the PC.<br />
<br />
What Also is interesting, is If the spoken reply by mobs IS a tru indication of a successful taunt. We all assume that to be true, and until recently it was accepted as gospel, now I think that puts into question this belief. <br />
<br />
THAT is one of my STRONGEST points in saying I want a damn taunt message pass/fail EVERYTIME... make it filterable so no one else has to see them, but damnit, we need to know. I remember on another thread, people saying a pass/fail taunt message would be useless, do we think so now?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kosari</div><div class="date">07-11-2003, 09:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My observations have lead me to make the following conclusions regarding hate and taunt;<br />
<br />
<br />
Hate has a cap value<br />
<br />
There is no such thing as a &quot;failed&quot; taunt - taunt generates a fixed amount of hate based on your range from the mob, and your skill<br />
<br />
Hitting the taunt key generates a lot of hate<br />
<br />
When someone hits max hate, any action they take that generates hate, effects everyone else on the hate list - reducing their hate by that amount.  <br />
<br />
No-one can be &quot;pushed off the bottom of the hate list&quot;.<br />
<br />
The hate list is very large, if not unlimited<br />
<br />
Range varies the amount of hate generated by specific actions<br />
<br />
Crits generate hate<br />
<br />
The Backstab action generates hate<br />
<br />
Damage generates very little hate alone, but acts as modifier to your hate value (edit - Or damage puts you at a certain level on the hate list that you cannot go below).<br />
<br />
Sitting and standing either create/decay hate, or apply a modifier to your current hate - the effect is the same.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is how I have always believed hate works.  I have never seen any event that cant be explained by this theory.  Please post if you have had any experience that would indicate a flaw in this.<br />

PS - Any Pally should be able to tell you that you can taunt off low HP taunt.  I find it hard to believe that &quot;everyone thought&quot; that you couldnt.  Im sure Im not alone in knowing thats wrong for over a year. <br />
<br />
Get a pally to prove it with this simple test.  Get someone low hp.  Then when they get aggro, stun the mob.  Low HP person runs away, pally continues to stun the mob.  When the mob is allowed to recover  .. pally will have aggro.  So long as the other person is a decent distance away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Keane Abrams</div><div class="date">07-11-2003, 11:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I disagree with several of your comments Kosari.<br />
<br />
1) &quot;There is no such thing as a &quot;failed&quot; taunt - taunt generates a fixed amount of hate based on your range from the mob, and your skill&quot; <br />
<br />
Could not disagree more. In fact Brutal's logs prove that taunt does indeed fail. A&quot;failed&quot; taunt on a talking mob will result in no message. Also, a successful taunt is not a fixed hate value. That is why taunting when you have aggro will not generate any more hate at all. Again, Brutal's tests prove this. <br />
<br />
2) &quot;Crits generate hate&quot;<br />
<br />
I have never known this to be true. As warriors we crit all the damn time and I have yet to see a mob turn on me because of a crit. Crits are eye-candy, nothing more.<br />
<br />
3) &quot;Damage generates very little hate alone, but acts as modifier to your hate value&quot;<br />
<br />
High DPS weapons can generate a lot of hate, which of course is just pure damage.</div></div><hr />

Not true, and disproved again with the tests here.  Brutul would taunt non agroed guards, they would not agro till he got the 'I will teach you...' message.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Hitting the taunt key generates a lot of hate <br />
<br />
Again, not true, see above.<br />
<br />
Crits generate hate <br />
<br />
I believe this also is not true, as best evidence of this one, I offer the patch awhile back where agro was screwed up.  Rangers and wizzies where getting massacered when they critted and gained more agro than normal from it.<br />

All data is aligned to a DWORD now. There is no way you could ever possibly get enough hate to equal the storage of a DWORD. You could proc EB twice a second for a year and still have room to spare.</div></div><hr />

Not anymore...used to be able to, due to so many people and distance.  RAngers and wizards could stand far away and not get agro because they weren't on the hate list despite their damage.  Used to be a max people on hate list...one of those holdovers from the original EQ that never got upgraded.  Distance could also push you off the list at times...wizards found this out.<br />
<br />
The hate list is very large, if not unlimited<br />
See above.<br />
<br />
<br />
There's the flaw...you're mistaking taunt (as in agro) for Taunt (the ability...you know, that button you rarely have to use?).  It's been the idea that you cannot Taunt, meaning use the actual ability, to get agro over low hp agro.  Stuns would be considered taunt.  There's a significant difference.  Also, depending on your meaning of &quot;recover&quot;, of course you'd still have agro after he had a chance to recover.  The person low on hp is only high on agro list while they have low hp.  If they recovered up to above that low hp area(20%), then it goes back to whoever had it before...it's not lasting agro after you get healed.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brodda Thep</div><div class="date">07-11-2003, 12:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This has already been stated.  I don't know why it seemed to have been brushed off.<br />
<br />
But <br />
AGGRO = HATE + BONUS<br />
<br />
This it the theory I subscribe to.  Taunt will only put you at HATE + x.  Where x is a small number, possibly one.<br />
<br />
I think there are many different bonuses.  <br />
<br />
DA is a huge negative bonus.  So if you taunt off of a DAed person and that person had huge agro, you would still have HUGE agro when that DA wore off.<br />
<br />
For instance, pally stuns multiple times and is the only one on the hate list, he DAs and a warrior taunts till successful.  The mob WILL turn on to that warrior while the pally is DAed.  Have Pally zone and come back.  A stun will not pull the mob off of the warrior.  I have not tested that hypothesis though.<br />
<br />
Also low health agro is a huge bonus.  Hypothesis being that you can never taunt off of a low health agroed person if it is attacking that person to begin with.<br />
<br />
I believe being OOR of mellee range is also a rather large negative bonus.  Just try to pull a boss mob on engage over your clerics.  They will NOT survive.  I have seen this done with AoW multiple times.  It isn't proximity agro, it is that the clerics don't have the large negative bonus that being oor gives them.<br />
<br />
If that is true it also means that taunting while tanking a boss mob IS useful.  ie caster agro might be 9000 where 10000 is hate and -1000 is the bonus given for being OOR.  However you, as a tank, might be at 95xx where 9500 is your hate and xx is your bonus.  Even though you are tanking, a successful taunt should put your hate at 10000 + x (the casters hate value is 10000 though his agro is 9000.) Which will give you 500 more hate.  Again, I haven't proven this.<br />
<br />
I also believe that there are small bonuses for race and level and perhaps charisma?  But these would only be minor considerations.<br />
<br />
I do know that we perform tank switches on TZ in time.  We have one warrior not attack at all.  he gets NO agro.  When the switch is called he AETaunts and TZ switches targets.<br />
<br />
As for the four taunt?  Like the other person said.  The cleric may have been receiving some bonus to agro.  And even though you had higher hate, his agro remained higher than yours until you taunted off of your OWN hate enough to raise your agro above that of the clerics.   ie if his hate was 10000, then after the first taunt your hate was 10000 + x.  But x was still too small to overcome the bonus that your cleric was receiving.  <br />
<br />
Here is a test.  Do the same thing, but just attack instead of taunt.  See how long it takes to get it off of your cleric.  Then repeat but first get one successful taunt and then see how long it takes to get it off of your clerics.  My guess is that it will take one swing.<br />
<br />
I think stun might be a negative bonus. <br />
<br />
Hmm.  I have an SK and a shaman, I think I will go play around with this real quick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">07-11-2003, 12:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I'm starting to hate Freeport.  Did a bunch more tests this morning, with interesting results, but I can't necessarily explain them.<br />
<br />
First test I was going to try to repeat my test making sure the warrior was closer to the mob than the cleric.  After about 10 stuns, the warrior computer crashed hard and had to be booted up in safe mode, rebooted, etc.  All the time this was going on I kept stunning with the cleric this whole time, probably stunned 30+ times...got the warrior back on and it took 4 taunts, I was closer to the mob than the cleric.  Did this several times throughout the morning and I don't really think it's a factor.  It was interesting that the number of taunts were the same when there was a lot more stuns on the mob.<br />
<br />
So the next test I only stunned 5 times.  4 taunts again<br />
<br />
So I tried it with only 1 stun.  4 taunts again.<br />
<br />
Next test I decided to do some serious damage with the warrior so I pulled the guard, beat him down to half health, procced my SoD on him, and then ducked and started stunning with the cleric.  It took 6 or 8 stuns to get it off of the warrior.  After it was off, I stunned 10-12 more times and then taunted it with the warrior.  1 successful taunt pulled it off of the cleric.<br />
<br />
Next I pulled the mob with taunt...did no damage though.  Stunned him up with the cleric but still got aggro with just one taunt.<br />
<br />
Then I tried pulling with the cleric, stunning it up, then doing a few points of damage before starting to taunt.  Took 4 taunts to get aggro.<br />
<br />
Next I pulled with the cleric, using a stun.  Then I beat on the mob with the warrior (no taunts) until I got aggro.  Stunned again and got aggro back on the cleric.  Then I stunned 10+ more times and taunted off with the warrior.  Took 4 taunts.<br />
<br />
Just kinda some rapid-fire tests this morning.  My log isn't too hot because I turned others hits, other spells, etc all off for raids last night and forgot to turn them back on.  I don't think they're that interesting so I'm not gonna clean em up and post them unless somebody wants to see them.  <br />
<br />
At this point I'm not planning to do any more tests.  Would love to see some of these tests repeated by others though.  I don't know what to think about this last set of tests, so I'm not going to try to draw any conclusions right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tugurok</div><div class="date">07-11-2003, 01:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In the old Kunark guide from Prima, mobs are listed with a trait indicating likelihood of &quot;frenzying&quot; -- apparently some mobs do and some don't. It's possible &quot;frenzied&quot; mobs could be taunt resistant, or have different aggro rules (like they won't change targets for x period of time, maybe like the enrage timer).<br />
<br />
I'm looking through the guide to see if there are talking mobs which are listed as non-frenzying.<br />
<br />
There's also the issue of the relation of damage to aggro. Summoning mobs for example, won't summon until a certain proportion of damage has actually been done. <br />
<br />
Anyway, it all has to boil down to the aggro algorithm, and the ways in which taunt interacts with aggro seem a lot more complicated than we thought. Even assuming taunt &quot;works&quot; 40-60% of the time (depending on messages from talking mobs of varying con levels), these interactions seem to weaken taunt even further (taunt immune mobs, frenzying mobs, possible caps, etc.)<br />
<br />
Great job Brutul!</div></div><hr />

Look at Brutal's second test.<br />

I will tell you if you damage mob, then lose aggro, let that other person take their hate to the limit- a fixed number of taunts will always regain aggro.<br />

This is because taunt never fails, and always produces a fixed amount of hate.  <br />

I have known that taunt never fails for a long time, because there is always a fixed way to lock aggro from tash and slow.  Damage, minor stun then taunt will always gain aggro from tash and slow combined.  It never fails, the taunt never fails .. without it aggro is not gained.  Taunt does not fail.<br />

There is far less evidence of that being the case than taunt being a pass/fail type skill.  There is simply far more evidence of a skill check, pass/fail system than that every taunt adds hate.  If every taunt adds hate, he should have agroed guards first time every time with just taunt.<br />

What hate limit? What evidence to you have for whatever value you suppose is there? How many taunts? How do you know?<br />
<br />

We already know from developer comments this isn't true, and it's counter to what we know of EQ mechanics in general, and taunt in particular. If this were true, why would a taunt *skill* even exist? Obviously there has to be a skill check. Taunt does fail, and the amount of hate taunt produces varies.<br />
<br />
<br />
The message &quot;I'll teach you ..&quot; that you see is random, but will always occur when you hit the top of the hate list and gain aggro.<br />

It also occurs when you don't gain aggro, though possibly only in special situations. What then?</div></div><hr />

The hate list is very large, if not unlimited <br />
<br />
From a sheer technical standpoint this is extremely unlikely.  There would be a performance impact of managing 100+ person hate lists...I'm fairly certain there is a list cap of some kind (again no proof...just experience in writing high performace systems).<br />
<br />
All data is aligned to a DWORD now. There is no way you could ever possibly get enough hate to equal the storage of a DWORD. You could proc EB twice a second for a year and still have room to spare. <br />
<br />
Interesting you have access to their data dictionary?  I'd be very interested in asking you several questions if you do (this is not sarcasm i am being sincere).  Also DWORD is an MS SDK defined term yes?  That would mean access to their architecture structure or is is a guess they use SDK framework?</div></div><hr />

<br />
yeah a warrior could do this also but iun effect you are not taunting off a low hp person the AI is smart here and it does not make sence for a mob to chace a person a good distance away wile a active player is beating on it (it fixes a exploit) Expolit being if the low hp person runs and the mob is snared someone could effectively kill it from behind wiht NO risk so SoE made the mob AI smart.<br />
<br />
To sum up you cnanot taunt off  alow HP player period. the mob will stay on it untill dead or has sufficint hp's with the one limitation of proximity if the low hp player is out of melee range and continues to run the mob will go back to the person on the aggro list that is highes if said player returns with low hp the mob will go back to it immideately once in range. For all purposes you cannot taunt off a low hp player.</div></div><hr />

Hi.<br />
<br />
AGRO = HATE + BONUS<br />
<br />
Anyone notice this yet?<br />
<br />
Yeah?<br />
<br />
A successful taunt will ALWAYS put you at the top of the HATE list.  However, that hate list is altered to determine who is going to be getting hit.<br />
<br />
In your case your cleric is receiving a BONUS for being the first on the hate list.  Thus it took longer for you to taunt enough to get higher AGRO than the cleric.  <br />
<br />
I just went to FG with a shaman and an SK.  I pulled a shroom with slow, crippled, maliciously decayed, and then baned of nifed four times all the while chaining Flash of light.<br />
<br />
I waited for all the affects to wear off and then taunted with the sk.  First succesful taunt and it doesnt come off of the shaman.  I back up oor with the shaman and the shroom is stuck to my SK.  This means the other three taunts that it takes you to get the mob to hit you is almost NO hate.  <br />
<br />
I do the same thing again.  One successful taunt and the shroom is still on the shaman.  I swing my weapon once and the shroom is now attacking me.<br />
<br />
Bottom line, taunt works exactly like we always thought it did to the UNMODIFIED hate list.  So in a raid situation I would CONSTANTLY be hitting that taunt button cause I am sure that someone OOR of you is going over your HATE and you can leach that from them even though the mob is still hitting you.  <br />
<br />
In an exp group I probably wouldn't be doing that.  Becaues the negative bonus to hate for being oor of a mob is pretty small compared to the bonus applied to raid mobs.  (this is just a theory I have seen dealing with heal agro and raid mobs vs heal agro and exp mobs.  I mean ever wonder how a cleric can heal you for 6k damage after you have only done 500 damage to omnifiend but not get splatted?)<br />
<br />
I can't believe that all of this is raising such a fuss.  It only matches what I would exect to see.</div></div><hr />

Damage a mob, have someone else gain aggro and gain as much as they can.<br />

here's my quick analysis of Brutal's tests this morning.<br />
<br />
Every time the cleric agro'd first it took Brutal 4 successful taunts to get agro back.<br />
<br />
Every time the warrior pulled he could get agro back with one taunt.<br />
------<br />
<br />
Let me know if misread anything.<br />
<br />
Brutal, I am assuming that when you say it took 4 taunts, that means it took 4 taunts where the mob responded verbally.<br />

<br />
Brutal's tests indicate there is something interesting going on when the hate list is first constructed.<br />

<br />
From what Brutal posted we can say that a taunt will put you at the top of the hate list + some small amount of hate even if you are the one at the top of the hate list already.<br />
<br />
Now if the bonus that took 3 extra taunt to overcome was because he pulled the shroom with his cleric first, like I did with my shaman, we can say that the bonus to this was quite small.  All it took for me to get it off of my shaman after the first succesful taunt was a double attack with my windblade for 84 damage and a miss.  So that miss and that hit was enough to over come any bonus received by pulling first.<br />
<br />
I don't exactly know what you expect to see, or what you hope to accomplish by analyzing this?  <br />
<br />
At any rate, in the case of the shrooms the first taunt gets you 99% or more of the agro you need to get that shroom to come off of whoever it had been attacking.</div></div><hr />

I agree with what you're posting for the most part.  The only test that didn't really support your theory was the one where I pulled with the cleric, then taunted it off of him with melee damage (didn't use taunt), then stunned, and still needed 4 taunts to get aggro.  It seems to me that since I was high enough to pull the mob off of him at one point, any &quot;bonus&quot; that he received for pulling would have been overcome by that point and it shouldn't have taken 4 taunts to get aggro after that.  I have seen twice now as well where I taunted off of the cleric, did something with the cleric to regain aggro, and then it took 4 more taunts to regain aggro, even though I had just had it.  I guess that these &quot;bonuses&quot; like being the first one on the aggro list don't go away until the mob is dead or mem-blurred.  This theory makes a lot of sense to me.  I liked your test and it supports your opinion.<br />
<br />
Kosari -<br />
<br />
In my &quot;talking mob&quot; log, you can see multiple instances of me taunting a non-kos guard and not getting aggro.  In many cases, I could taunt a guard once, get aggro on the first taunt, zone-out and back in, and taunt the exact same guard as many as 6 times without getting aggro.  Explain how this could happen if all taunts are successful and add the same amount of aggro.</div></div><hr />

<br />
say a succesfull taunt is 50 points and you are 130 points below the highest person . you would need 3 succesfull taunts to take agro but instead of getting all 150 points of agro you would only get 131.</div></div><hr />

I am posing a question here for all the classes to respond to. Should the cap for taunt be raised for all the taunt capable classes? (War, SK, Pal, Rang). I think it should be raised. With the new more powerful spells, increased skill caps (offense/weapon skill), new weapons with high taunt factors, and the new disciplines, the taunting classes are going to have a hellacious time keeping anything on them. <br />
<br />
<br />
The skill level associated with taunt interacts with your level to determine how likely the taunt is to be successful. It does not control the level of success. A successful taunt will always make the creature shift to you, assuming that it can be taunted (Yes, some creatures are untauntable). <br />
Taunt makes a creature hate you just a little bit more than it hates the next guy on the list. In other words, multiple successful taunts, or taunting a creature that is already attacking you doesn't do anything extra. <br />
<br />
I hope that clears up how Taunt works. <br />

<br />
SK and Warrior...<br />
<br />
BOTH NON-kos<br />
<br />
SK pulls casts ONLY his HATE+ spells... Cast 1, 5, 10, 15... etc<br />
Test with warrior taunt how many it takes to taunt off with JUST taunt.<br />
<br />
I believe that damage from melee/spells afects hate/aggro differently.<br />
<br />
In order to test this we need the most controlled enviorment possible. The SK hate added spells are perfect in this effect. Both classes do no damage, SK just gain hate, warrior just taunt. Also the warrior should con the mob after each taunt.<br />
<br />
I think faction may have some affect on hate also.</div></div><hr />

After four bane of nifes I taunted till I got a message.  (It happened the first time for me.) and then I bashed it for 12 pts of damage.  It stayed on the shaman.<br />
<br />
I then repeated the test and taunted and again got the message the first taunt.  I then attacked.  I tried to hit one time but missed and the shroom turned on me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tarkas</div><div class="date">07-11-2003, 03:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You could probably test it with a few melee, a wiz and a shaman. Wiz tags first with a lure (no ID items on) with shaman as 2nd person to aggro (via slow) then re-run it with shaman as 8th or 10th to aggro with other people just pinging once with an arrow. <br />
<br />
Aggro rules have changed so many times for EQ its hard to say whats current but i've heard that aggro used to be calculated by what your potential damage was each round, not by what you actually connected for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brodda Thep</div><div class="date">07-11-2003, 03:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only test that didn't really support your theory was the one where I pulled with the cleric, then taunted it off of him with melee damage (didn't use taunt), then stunned, and still needed 4 taunts to get aggro.

<br />
Actually it does support the theory.<br />
<br />
Lets say pulling with the cleric gives 50 bonus hate.  The cleric then gets 10000 hate.  Now the agro the cleric has is 10050.  You then mellee until you have 10051 agro.  I am assuming you have no bonuses to agro in this.<br />
<br />
Now the cleric stuns and stun is pretty large hate.  Lets say 500.  Cleric now has 10550 Agro but only 10500 hate.<br />
<br />
You then taunt and you get put at 10501 hate, but your agro is still less than the clerics.  SO then you will end up having to successfully taunt four times to get it onto yourself.<br />
<br />
This is the only thing that explains how you can't taunt off of a person sitting or low health agro.<br />
<br />
It also explains why if AoW gets in mellee range of a cleric on the pull he will shred that cleric, but if they are OOR of mellee and do the same healing they aren't touched.  <br />
<br />
The only thing that interests me in all of this is if a warrior can gain significant hate by getting a successful taunt even if they are already being attacked.  It seems like certain mobs like say VZ in Time have large negative bonus' to agro for being OOR.  VZ likes to stun for 30 seconds every 24 seconds.  So if a warrior kept spamming taunt it is likely that he might be able to tank longer than if he was to not hit the taunt key.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I believe that is true.  In fact, I have a bit of evidence to support it.  The final mob for the Loyalist shield of honor quest requires vampyre bane weapons to hit.  Weapons without vamp bane get the immune message.  I have zero proc aggro weapons, so my choice when I was going to tank him was either duel wield bane piercers, or stick with my usual aggro weapon, Greatstaff of the Four Winds.  GSot4W is a pure dps aggro weapon.  It does have a proc, but it's a minor 75pt dd, that doesn't even really matter.  I decided to test a theory I had, which was about the same as what I quoted at the beginning of the post.  So I used my staff, and I kept aggro perfectly well.  I didn't even proc for the first half of the fight either.  My dps was around 1 maybe with procs towards the end, yet I didn't lose aggro once.<br />

Yeah, I thought you went on to explain it, but you started off the post by saying the theory didn't support what you were seeing.  So I was kinda confused.<br />

As to the dword?  There is a complie option that will align you memory to dwords.  Having memory align to dwords speeds up process time.  Just because it takes up a dword, doesn't mean that the code will use or can use the entire DWORD.</div></div><hr />

Hate ie Aggro is a combination of 4 things, Melee Hate, Non Melee Hate, Hate Aggro Modifier, Hate List Modifier.<br />
First is Melee Hate - created from actual melee damage to a mob (DPS)<br />
Second is Non Melee Hate - created form spells, damage sheilds, Proximity, and (Taunt) <br />
Third is Hate Aggro modifier - Sitting, low health, character level, fast aggressive damage (Wiz nuking for 5k) this is probably high numbers and scales from 50 for full health far away and not sitting to 2000 to 3000.<br />
Fourth Hate List Modifier (will explain later).<br />
Back in the days of Kunark melee hate ie weapons aggro'd for 200 dmg on really good weapons would be alot.<br />
non melee weapons or spells were 1000 damage.<br />
How I perceive this all tying together is as follows, Hate ie aggro is a cumulative effect every hit landed on a mob creates that amount of hate on that mob so as the MT hits more and more, his hate rises (reason why gainging aggro makes sense) MT hits taunt each successful taunt adds MT's skill level of taunt (ie 200 skill = 200 hate) to the non melee hate list, also having DS on MT adds to this.<br />
Now of course the MT isnt sitting, his health varies at every point, but each tick the mobs checks his health and assigns his number for that on list 3.<br />
And finally list number 4 mob checks how many lists said person is on and assigns a modifier to all the above.<br />
<br />
Heres my example<br />
MT <br />
1) 1000 melee damage, <br />
2) 3 taunts x 200  + 300 damage in Damage sheilds = 1200 non melee damage (this could be tested by having one warrior get 2 successful taunts and see if it takes 3 to get it back all else being identical ie melee damage DS Dmg proximity lvl so on)<br />
3) no idea how this is assigned per chance say 100 hate<br />
for a grand total of 2300 hate<br />
4) Now that we have 2300 hate we check the modifier, MT is on 3 lists so multiply 2300 x 3 = 6900 Hate<br />
<br />
Caster<br />
1) Melee damage - None<br />
2) Spell damage 4 casts, 600 , 700 , 545 , 800 = 2645 Hate<br />
3) casters standing far away full health and same level as MT , so he gets 50 hate<br />
4) modifier - 2695 times 2 since hes only on 2 lists = 5390 Hate<br />
<br />
Back in the Day Taunt was for Warrior's as Spell casting was casters, it added some hate but made sure they stayed on the extra list, since Non Melee aggro has risen in such numbers Non Melee has begun to take over Hate, also why hate has to be generated over time for warrior's<br />
<br />
The above example also explains why over time the Tank gets more and more aggro because thier Melee aggro builds, What this shows is basically Taunt which is considered Non Melee Aggro has risen by 30 points while spells have risen exponetially, SoE/VI assumed Melee aggro was going to rise at the same speed to equal the difference so there was no reason to alter this formula.<br />
<br />
One reason I believe theres a Non Melee and Melee Hate list and a modifier that adds those together in some fashion is this ... <br />
<br />
When a mob comes in to raid camp I face the mob and taunt my ass off while the ENCH tries to Mez it (without meleeing and breaking Mez when it lands) while said ENCH is tashing and mezzing, Taunt &quot;Should&quot; if successful put me on a higher aggro then the ENCH before Mez lands, meaning Taunt makes me hated with the value of Tash + 1 per SoE, but after years of doing this I have NEVER EVER successfully aggro'd a mob of an ENCH before they could mez it EVER ( I continue to try but still fail) which means Taunt is on a Non Melee Hate list but is less than Tash hate, and without melee Hate list I cant hope to EVER out aggro that ENCH, so I either hit the mob to get on 2 lists and possibly break Mez or I continue as I am, to continue on this theory I have Taunted a mezzed mob 3 times assited and still had the ENCH in mobs target, So I hit the mob and wouldnt you know it it stays on me, hmmm ( I got on the second list with Melee damage ) and third for proximity,  interesting. <br />
<br />
Everything I listed here is purely conjecture and in no way prescribing to be pure Factual in anyway, I simply ran figures in my head and made guesstimates of some things I have noticed ingame, the only way to prove such things would be long exhausting tests. But as for Brutuls 4 Taunt conclusion how I percieve that is a safety catch 4 successful taunts would be programmed as instant aggro sort of a fail safe they added in. But see if you dont realize how having a Wizzy nuke like mad walk to a mob and not have aggro, then hit attack and add themselves to the melee hate list see much hate that generates, non melee aggro without Melee Aggro and vice versa are hard to break which is what keeps mobs stuck to Pally's (ie why Brutul couldn't pull aggro off his CLR without melee damage), and by looking at what I devised here adding 20 points to taunt to max skill at 250 is like a drop in the bucket, this could be why SoE can't resolve this issue, because tinkering with melee damage could offset non melee and cause aggro lock, but adding to taunt would mean nothing where our issue is begining of the fight but by 30% aggro lock would be a given.<br />
<br />
Ae Taunt is not a given, I have pressed it with 6 mobs around and had all but one ignore me since others were engaged on them, again AE Taunt is non melee hate I guess somewhere around the same hate 230 skill x 2 = 460 or Enraging Taunt (CHSD) on all mobs in the area, and neither of these are a guarantee aggro. <br />
<br />
Ok folks pick it apart, but please remember I spent about an hour typing this and proofing, and 2 hours laying in bed dazing, so please at least take 30 mins to consider and ponder my ideas before you flame me =P and <br />
BTW Awesome test Brutul always nice having someone take the time to check our class out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It will ALWAYS do that, but not necessarily because the way you described (although I'm not discrediting what you are saying, either).  When a mob is messed, its current target is whoever it was attacking at that time.  Hate is not calculated on a mob that is not attacking.  A mob changes his target at the start of his next action (I have seen this before while tanking things that go into caster mode; ie the Water tower BoT mini).  If I lose aggro for a second, and he casts on a bard for instance, and I hit taunt, then /assist him, he is still targeting on the bard...but as soon as the spell lands, he faces me.  (Yes, when I lose aggro on something I shouldnt, I always /assist/tab to see who to yell at...I'm not raiding things that are Kill Fast with big CH chains all the time)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Britty</div><div class="date">07-13-2003, 07:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I remember posting up my theory on how taunt seemed to work many months ago now. I still stick by them now as much as I did then. In essence I never believed a successful taunt threw you immediately above every single other possible agro source right to the top of the hate list, how overpowered would that be. A wandering warrior walks up to a mob thats 1% health left with an agro list a mile long, and without having attacked it happens to press taunt you're telling me there's an extremely good chance it will ignore all the other damage dealers who have been on it for so long and turn to the wandering warrior. I'm still not convinced.<br />
<br />
 I don't know where the post is now (it's many many months old) and I'm not going to rehash it all over again, but basically I never believed taunt throws you automatically to the top of the hate list no matter what the circumstances......and i was doubted for saying so, even after providing muchly the same anecdotal evidence just like Brutal has which conflicted with everyones belief they hey taunt puts you onto the top of the haste list if successful...and why? Because Verant says it does.  <br />
<br />
Thanks Brutal for doing some tests to see it for yourself, and others who have come up with mixed results to show well shoot, maybe taunt doesnt work the way you all thought it did just because Absor released a statement saying so....whoopdee doo....I never placed that much credence in Verant's information to Warriors anyway ;p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kormus</div><div class="date">07-14-2003, 05:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Was pointed here from SK.org - too lame to read the whole thread but just to share some experience I had with taunt.<br />
<br />
Setting: Pre PoP Empror Ssraeshza fight, a SK guildie and me are off tanking Devourers.<br />
Take a tank taunting a mob for 40 minutes straight with spells, disarm, some h2h ripostes and spamming it with debuffs and snares.<br />
Emperor drops, SK guildie bids on an item and wins. he has to head off to loot and wants me to take over.<br />
Three minutes later a taunt (not a spell) got the mob on me after releasing a barrage of agro on it. Take taunt refresh, divide 3 minutes by that number and you got the numbers of taunt failures. <br />
This happened so often (had to do this at least a dozen times so far, some times pre PoP, some with 65) that I am convinced now that after a certain time taunt will not be able to get you on the #1 Hate List spot with +1 hate to #2 anymore. I am maybe picking up theories that have already been posted but what if taunt (being one of the oldest 'untuned' skills in game) still has an 'old' value?<br />
What if a successful taunt is only 32,000 hate? There are still some limits to this point of view as it does not explain how and when it 'blocks' the addition of 32k hate when the #1 Hate List spot is only 500 points away for example but to me it is the most sound conclusion so far. <br />
This could be parsed easily, the idea to add a SK with fixed value agro spells and checking taunt working before and after 32k agro have been built up someone should do - if we got someone on AB who wants to do that feel free to contact me.<br />

I am 55 warrior and my buddy is 60+ SK.  I asked him, &quot;If I pull a freeport gaurd with a wack, how many successful taunts do you think it will take you to taunt if off me?&quot;  I wanted to appeal to his sense of ego, in order to have a partner for my experimentation.  &quot;One&quot;, was my friend's confident reply.  &quot;I will bet you a 10lb Halas Meat Pie that you can't&quot;, I said.  And our testing was on.<br />
Let me state up front that I have the log from this experimentation, and I will post it when I get back to my home computer this evening.<br />
<br />
Warrior is indifferent faction to FP Gaurds and totally unbuffed.<br />
I forgot to ask the SK what his faction is and also unbuffed.<br />
<br />
Summarized findings:<br />
1.  Warrior pulled with a wack.  Ducked.  SK took 4 successful taunts to get aggro.  I stood and taunted and got aggro on 1st successful taunt.  Ducked again, took SK 4 additional taunts.<br />
<br />
2.  Sk pulled with a wack.  He ducked.  Took warrior 4 successful taunts to get aggro.  He stood and taunted and got aggro on 1st successful taunt.  Sk ducked again, took me (the warrior) 4 additional successful taunts.<br />
<br />
This gives me great confidence that the Brutul test can be duplicated over and over.  Not that I doubted you buddy, but it's good to get results duplicated.  So the SK protests and says yeah but this ain't accurate representation of how to gain aggro on a mob...yada yada.  We had some discussion in tells about to conducting a variation on the test.  Based on these results, we know that the puller has the advantage to regain aggro with a single successful tuant....<br />
Well shit...I was about to detail our other experiments...and as I sit here at work the details are now fuzzier than I thought they were and the last thing that I want to do at this stage of the discussion is to misstate the facts of the experiment.  When I get on the computer this evening I will post my log and summarize the few other tests that the SK and warrior executed.  <br />
<br />
The bottom line is that there DOES seem to be a taunt advantage to the puller when it comes to maintaining aggro.  The puller can control the aggro by using Feign Death or other tool, if the goal is to allow the warrior to 'tank' the mob.  <br />
<br />
Apocaly -<br />
Good point about the CT revamp and the zone modifier to taunt.  <br />
<br />
Garoar -<br />
You stated your case very well.  I think that I probably understand the mechanics, numbers, logic, and coding of EQ far less than you and many others in this thread.  I am far better at testing than I am at theorizing.<br />
<br />
I think that what we can say for certain at this point, is that a single successful taunt may put you at the top of the Hate list, but it is only a very small piece of the complicated aggro picture.  I also believe that as the warrior in the group, I can expect to hold aggro much more reliably if I am the puller or if the puller is able to perform a successful Feign Death or similar action.<br />
<br />
Look for my log in this thread later tonight (after 8pm CST).</div></div><hr />

Nice test!  Very glad to see the 4 taunt thing duplicated, and it just serves to further confirm what we have learned in this thread.  Thanks for trying this out :).<br />
<br />
I need to get a summary written up for this thread.</div></div><hr />

I'm still not convinced. <br />
<br />
No, because hate agro is constantly moving for melee.  The melee are still attacking and causing agro.   Maybe if everyone stops attacking and the warrior walks up and hits TAUNT... I'd believe that, but not while people are still attacking because they are still gaining agro faster then the TAUNT key worked (it was top of hate +1 for an instant not forever).  In Brutul's test the cleric was doing stun damage I believe.  <br />
<br />
And Ive done that before, walked up to a mob that was beating on someone who had been attacking the mob for queit a while, I've pressed taunt and the mob snaps to me quickly then immediately back to the origianl attacker because they were still meleeing.  If that person stopped attacking before I hit taunt I believe the mob would have stayed looking at me, saying my taunt was successful.</div></div><hr />

I think that what we can say for certain at this point, is that a single successful taunt may put you at the top of the Hate list, but it is only a very small piece of the complicated aggro picture.  I also believe that as the warrior in the group, I can expect to hold aggro much more reliably if I am the puller or if the puller is able to perform a successful Feign Death or similar action.<br />
 <br />
<br />
Heh, I can tell you that if you pull with taunt it only gives you as much hate as if you had taunted off of someone with 0 aggro. However if you pull with disarm, it will give you a bonus + hate even though disarm won't do anything after that.</div></div><hr />

Because Verant says it does. <br />
<br />
uhhh...  HI.  Did you read the %$#$ thread?<br />
<br />
It was proven that a taunt DOES put you at the top of the HATE list.  Just that there are MINOR bonuses involved in figuring the AGRO list.  <br />
<br />
Taunt does exactly what verant said it did.  <br />
<br />
The three taunts after that first one to get that mob attacking them?  THey did almost NOTHING.  A single attack round would have equaled the hate gotten from those three successful taunts.  <br />
<br />
How we understand taunt was NOT revolutionized by this thread.  It was CLARIFIED.  Worthy yes, but nothing fundamental with how you view taunt should be changed due to these tests.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Either way is FUBAR.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">07-14-2003, 12:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's pretty clear that some of the recent posters didn't read the thread, which is understandable since it's on page 7.  Basically, this test was started to confirm what we had been saying about taunt on the boards for quite a while.  That a successful taunt puts you at the top of the hate list.  At first, it appeared that this wasn't true, and a minor game mechanic was discovered (the bonus thing) but our understanding of the basic functionality of taunt was verified.<br />
<br />
Taunt DOES put you at the top of the hate list when successful (disregarding a few &quot;bonuses&quot; to aggro like being the first one on the aggro list, or sitting, having low health, etc.<br />
<br />
Taunt DOES NOT add a fixed amount of aggro when successful, or if it does, it is a negligible amount.<br />
<br />
As Brodda said, nothing earth-shattering was discovered in this thread.  Basically it is a confirmation of what we already knew about taunt, and we discovered an interesting, but relatively inconsequential mechanic (the aggro bonus).<br />
<br />
I'll work on writing up a better summary of the thread, but for now, please resist the urge to post that you don't believe in these conclusions without first reading the whole thread because we don't want to go over the same things 50 times.</div></div><hr />

I'd say thought that taunt is still the same after 4 years in this game its not nerfed and still does put you on top of agro list after sucess.<br />
<br />
The thing that is new here is for mob to switch targets it takes more then just a taunt. You have to have 2 things happen taunter has to do dmg or produce some sort of additional agro or for person beeing attacked to reduce agro ei move away cast a spell whatever. As far back as I remember that has been always the case anyways, but now we know for sure that just a taunt is not enough.<br />
<br />
As 4 taunt thing concered thats a cool test but doesnt really effect normal play much since its done in pure test conditions. There are not many if any situations one does not attack while/after taunt has been pressed.</div></div><hr />

Looking at the tests, the person who did not pull had not done a single thing to the mob other than taunt.  I am more inclined to believe that the bonus is for having actually done something negative to the mob.  Maybe a test where one person pulls, then the warrior hits the mob once, then proceeds to taunt would be in order?  I would do the test myself, but I won't be able to for a few days, if no one does by then, I'll see if I can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gimmel</div><div class="date">07-14-2003, 05:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, let me see if I have this straight. The reason it is taking 4 taunts is because the first one brings him to the top of the hate list, but not the aggro list. It takes 3 more taunts to overcome the &quot;bonus&quot; aggro of being the first person on the list, even though this is a very small amount, less than is generated by one weapon swing. Is this correct?<br />
<br />
If so, that must mean that a successful taunt while on top of the hate list does still add a tiny (very tiny) amount of aggro if 3 additional taunts does indeed bump up the taunter enough to get aggro, doesn't it?<br />
<br />
Definately some very good work going on in this thread, I appreciate the work of those that given their time to test this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">07-14-2003, 06:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You are right Gimmel, it does seem to add a tiny amount if you are on the top of the hate list.  I think the way it works is that it acts like a normal successful taunt.  Basically, you taunt the mob off of yourself, giving you your original hate + 1.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
On the contrary, I would actually have said that your test results show that taunt does add a fixed amount of aggro when succesfull - approximately 1/4 as much as is needed to switch places on the hate list.<br />
<br />
That a mob will not switch from it's current target unless the hate of the new person exceeds the hate of the current target by a certain threshold seems an easy assumption.<br />
<br />
That that bonus is negligible though is obviously not in question if 3x that bonus is equivalent to a small hit and a miss, as your tests seem to indicate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I noticed something strange with the 4 taunts last night in BoT also. Group was  65 Warrior, 63 Warrior, 65 SK (Note: was 2 boxed on the chanter so was doing nothing but pet attack and melee), 65 cleric, 65 monk, and 65 chanter. I was MT as 65 Warrior. Monk would pull, get to camp and FD, I would be the first to hit on each inc after the monk FD. When the chanter would slow from time to time the other warrior would beat me to /shield and he would taunt just in case mine failed. On each occasion that the other warrior got the aggro from that situation (3 times), it would take me 4 taunts to get it back off of him. <br />
Just thought that it was a little strange and put more support to what most of ya's are saying. The second two times I counted to the group each taunt. I guess the good part is on every 4th taunt I knew I would get the aggro back but damn that could be hell in raids but most peeps die faster than the 4 taunts can refresh in raids anyways so i bet it just never gets noticed........</div></div><hr />

If you mean that getting the &quot;interfere&quot; message from a mob = successful taunt, then I don't know if I would agree with this statement.  I may be wrong, but no one knows what happened on those 4 taunt messages that didn't get agro.  They may be doing absolutely nothing in terms of the hate list.  All you know is that you are required to get the &quot;interfere&quot; message 4 times before getting agro if you are not the first person to agro the mob.<br />
<br />
What happens if you get 1-3 &quot;interfere&quot; messages but no agro, then zone the cleric?  I don't recall this kind of test being done (granted, I may have missed it somewhere in the 15 pages of this thread).</div></div><hr />

The taunt does indeed put you on the hate list even though it fails to give you agro.  The guard started attacking me after the cleric zoned.  That's what I was looking for.  Now I think I'll try making a noobie &amp; see how much damage I have to do to get a mob off my warrior after taunting.  If assumptions are correct, one or two points of damage is all it should take.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We were in the Factory (POI) with one mob being killed and  another mezzed. The cleric LD'd just before the first mob dropped. I taunted the mezzed mob for a good 5 minutes straight getting hit from time to time between mezzes. The group decided that they wanted to try to kill it, being at 30% health I moved off to the corner to watch. They ended up having one death and aggroing the 2 door mobs. The strange thing was that once the group FD'd or zoned, the mob I had been taunting and disarming for a good 5 minutes never even took a look at me in the corner and walked right back to his spawn point. I am thinking this might be a zone by zone thing maybe at this point. I never did any melee damage but still should have been somewhere on the hate list. I was standing right by the little gnome guy so it wasn't like I was on the other end of the zone from the mob. Any ways, maybe someone else can make sense of it......</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do the test by targetting a mob (like the guard), hitting taunt over and over and over again for a while, while not attacking.  Then have an SK or someone cast a spell on the mob to see how many casts it takes to have the mob turn away from you.<br />
<br />
If taunt does add a small amount +1 when you ARE at the top of the list, then a small aggro spell should change the mob over to someone else.  If it adds X amount every time there's a sucessful taunt, then it should take a few casts to turn the mob.</div></div><hr />

That could be explained by mem-blur...all of the high-level enchanter mezzes have a pretty decent chance (40% I think) of blurring the mob every time they're cast.  <br />

From what I've seen it's a little more than 1-2 damage....somewhere around 10-20 should do it though.<br />

Post 58 (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?postid=22281#post22281) has a test basically doing what you suggested.  Would be interesting to see it repeated though with something lower aggro than CH to really get a feel for how much aggro you got for all of those taunts.</div></div><hr />

Taunt DOES put you at the top of the hate list when successful (disregarding a few &quot;bonuses&quot; to aggro like being the first one on the aggro list, or sitting, having low health, etc.<br />
<br />
Taunt DOES NOT add a fixed amount of aggro when successful, or if it does, it is a negligible amount.<br />
<br />
As Brodda said, nothing earth-shattering was discovered in this thread.  Basically it is a confirmation of what we already knew about taunt, and we discovered an interesting, but relatively inconsequential mechanic (the aggro bonus).<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok,  For some reason, this  'aggro bonus' seems like some convienient excuse that we can use in order to explain away the inconsistency of the 4-taunt effect, with what we always believed to be true. It is convienient and sounds ok, but just doesnt seem to ring true.<br />
<br />
I would propose a test, all of these tests were done with 2 people, how about we do this... <br />
<br />
 3 people go to the East Freeport Taunt testing grounds. One SK/Pal and 2 warriors...All non-kos<br />
<br />
1.) SK pulls with his EB spell, casting one time.<br />
2.) War #1 taunts until he gets aggro.<br />
3.) War #2 taunts until he gets aggro.<br />
<br />
How many taunts for War #1? I assume 4.<br />
How many for War #2? Any guesses?</div></div><hr />

That's not exactly what I was looking for.  I just tested it out myself with my bot cleric:<br />
 <br />
The taunt does indeed put you on the hate list even though it fails to give you agro.  The guard started attacking me after the cleric zoned.  That's what I was looking for.  Now I think I'll try making a noobie &amp; see how much damage I have to do to get a mob off my warrior after taunting.  If assumptions are correct, one or two points of damage is all it should take.  <br />
<br />
Actually this doesnt show anything if the cleric zoned. It just means you are the only one left on the hate list after the cleric was removed</div></div><hr />

Good suggestion.  I was wondering the same thing myself.  I am going to do my best to get some friends together for that test.  I want to see the results of that test...and this test<br />
<br />
SK pulls with wack.<br />
War_1 taunts twice successful, it is assumed that War_1 will still not have aggro cuz it takes 4 successes.<br />
War_2 taunts twice successful, then stops.<br />
War_1 taunts twice more successfully...does the mob shift to War_1?<br />
War_2 taunts twice more successfully...does the mob shift to War_2?  Or does it take an additional 4?<br />
<br />
My guess would be 2.</div></div><hr />

I'll test that as well...if I can get some assistance from some friends tonight.  <br />
I'm stating it now...I think the mob will follow the current aggro with War1, even if the War1 steps back after successful taunt from War2.<br />
<br />
Just wanna be on record <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">landrain</div><div class="date">07-17-2003, 12:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The reason I am disagreeing earlier...<br />
<br />
A) Statement - Successfull Taunt ADDS no Aggro if you are at top of hatelist.<br />
<br />
B) Statement - Successfull Taunt Puts you at the top of the hatelist.<br />
<br />
C) Aggro has a BONUS for Pulling<br />
<br />
D) Aggro is not same list as hatelist.<br />
<br />
<br />
If (A is true) And (B is True) And (C is True) and (D is TRue)... <br />
<br />
Then NO AMOUNT of Taunt will EVER get aggro onto a warrior that is ONLY taunting. <br />
<br />
Example...<br />
<br />
Cleric Swings at guard..<br />
<br />
Hatelist - Cleric get 100 hate from attacking a guard.<br />
Aggrolist- Cleric get 20 pt bonus for first aggro.<br />
Aggro list - cleric get 10 pt bonus for distance.<br />
<br />
Cleric doesnt cast or attack Guard.<br />
Cleric has 100 hate, 130 aggro<br />
<br />
Warrior Taunts and succeeds - get 101 hate. (first success)<br />
Warrior same distance as cleric from mob- gets 10 pt bonus<br />
<br />
Warrior 101 hate, 111 aggro<br />
Cleric has 100 hate, 130 aggro<br />
Cleric still being attacked...<br />
<br />
Warrior taunts and succeeds - no effect... hate still 101 (second success)<br />
Warrior same distance as cleric from mob- gets 10 pt bonus<br />
<br />
Warrior 101 hate, 111 aggro<br />
Cleric has 100 hate, 130 aggro<br />
Cleric still being attacked...<br />
<br />
Warrior taunts and succeeds - no effect... hate still 101 (third success)<br />
Warrior same distance as cleric from mob- gets 10 pt bonus<br />
<br />
Warrior 101 hate, 111 aggro<br />
Cleric has 100 hate, 130 aggro<br />
Cleric still being attacked...<br />
<br />
Warrior taunts and succeeds - no effect... hate still 101 ( forth success)<br />
Warrior same distance as cleric from mob- gets 10 pt bonus<br />
<br />
Warrior 101 hate, 111 aggro<br />
Cleric has 100 hate, 130 aggro<br />
Warrior being attacked...<br />
<br />
so where does the aggro change?<br />
<br />
We are still missing something here...</div></div><hr />

<br />
2 things.  Well, maybe 1 but anyhow. Let's rehash your example<br />
<br />
Example...<br />
<br />
Cleric Swings at guard..<br />
<br />
Hatelist - Cleric get 100 hate from attacking a guard.<br />
Aggrolist- Cleric get 3 pt bonus for first aggro. (this will matter later)<br />
Aggro list - cleric get 1 pt bonus for distance. (so will this)<br />
<br />
<br />
First successful taunt warrior get 101 hate, has 102 aggro (same distance from cleric).<br />
<br />
NOW, the warrior is on top of the hatelist with 101 hate versus the 100 for the cleric.<br />
<br />
He taunts again and gets to the top of the hatelist (101) plus 1 = 102.  102 hate and 103 aggro (same distance still), cleric has 104.<br />
<br />
Taunt 3, warrior 103 hate and 104 aggro, cleric 100 hate and 104 aggro.<br />
<br />
Taunt 4, warrior 104 hate and 105 aggro, cleric 100 hate and 104 aggro.<br />
warrior aggro &gt; cleric, warrior attacked.<br />
<br />
Now, it does turn on its head the assumption that taunting when you are on top of the hatelist is useless.  Sort of.  If a single swing generates 100 aggro, adding 1 hate for a successful taunt if you are on top of the hatelist is kind of pointless (although the 34 SK terror adds 200 hate and Pique adds 100 hate, so each swing is probably less).</div></div><hr />

War_2 taunts twice more successfully...does the mob shift to War_2? Or does it take an additional 4?<br />
<br />
My guess would be 2.<br />
<br />
I think warrior 2 would get aggro after his first two successful taunts...after all at this point he is taunting over warrior one and not the SK anymore.  After the mob is off the SK it should only take one successful taunt to switch the mob back and forth between the two warriors since neither of them has any bonus over the other.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kiztent</div><div class="date">07-18-2003, 08:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I did some testing of my own on aggro.  Just confirmed some results I suspected.<br />
<br />
Me and 2nd account (55 cleric) went to freeport and picked on a guard (Guard Effel, LB to 55 green to 58).<br />
<br />
First, I pulled with terror of death (53 SK spell, 450 hate).  One force pulled the guard off me (34 cleric spell, 6 second stun, 90 damage).<br />
<br />
Then, nuked with spear of plague (54 SK spell, 400DD, I have ID, it hit for 420). Took 3 forces to pull off me.<br />
<br />
Then I hit torrent of hate (55 SK spell, 35 ATK debuff) and THEN terror of death. Took 3 forces to pull off me (last one resisted).<br />
<br />
Then I just hit torrent of hate.  Took 1 force to pull off me.<br />
<br />
I'd say this is pretty definitive proof that pure hate isn't nearly as effective as hitting then getting hate (like by taunt).<br />
<br />
Other experiment:<br />
<br />
I pulled one of the gate guards with Terror of death.<br />
<br />
I then had a warrior melee with a big 2 hander (to make the turn easier to see).<br />
<br />
It took 2 hits to turn the guard<br />
192 crit<br />
73 slash (so 193-265 raw damage = 450 raw hate)<br />
<br />
Lastly:<br />
<br />
I pulled with stun and stunned again.  For a double stun, a single successful taunt pulled off the cleric.<br />
<br />
I then stunned again, pulling it back to the cleric. At this point, a successful taunt did not pull it off the cleric. A single slash for 79 did, however, pull it off the cleric. I meleed for 162 more, and a stun again pulled it off me. A successful taunt didn't pull him off the cleric again. I tried to atone, was resisted 6 times and zoned to clear aggro.<br />
<br />
I'll have to mess with the taunt/melee/stun thing some more.<br />
<br />
Next experiment:<br />
1 - how much melee does it take to overcome a stun.<br />
2 - If I hit in melee once can I overcome a single stun with a successful taunt, if not, how many will it take.<br />
3 - Same as 2, but for 2 stuns.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There's definitely something new/wonky going on.  Having the same experiences now (4 successful taunts to get aggro) in places I'd exp'ed in before w/o that problem, like tower of sol ro and pofire.  Most of the mobs there don't give a taunt success emote, but when the &quot;bug&quot; (more on this in a bit) occurs it ALWAYS takes at least 4 taunts to recover aggro, never less and usually more (due to fails that don't emote).<br />
<br />
I'm guessing this IS a code bug and not a &quot;feature&quot;, but haven't been able to nail down the all the exact conditions needed to replicate it in non-trivial situations.  Seems to happen to enchanters a LOT for some reason, which kind of makes sense as the issue (pretty obviously) has something to do with the order things happen during a fight.  Enchanters with GV casing boggle (and nothing else) on an otherwise-undamaged proximity  chain aggroed incoming mob does NOT have the result you'd expect...<br />
<br />
Some wild ideas about what might be happening:<br />
-aggro wrap-around (i.e. hate reduced below zero due to modifier wraps to maximum value possible)<br />
-some type of variable size mismatch between aggro focus check, hate list, and taunt/aggro generation code, or perhaps a 2 bit offset?  Need something to explain the always-4-to-succeed observation, either of those could do it.<br />
<br />
or perhaps...<br />
<br />
-this is deliberate/hardcoded, part of the &quot;melee balancing&quot; they've been promising; kill off the casters instead of nerfing them or buffing melee. ;)<br />

What I was trying to prove was that getting the &quot;interfere&quot; message meant that the taunt actually worked.  This disproves the theory that the &quot;interfere&quot; message is independant of a successful taunt.</div></div><hr />

BUT.. what if a successful taunt is an either or function.. either you get X amount of hate OR 25% of top targets aggro?  would neatly fit the 4x taunt success repeat you've been getting, as well as  1/2/3 taunt success.... and for the love of god do NOT ask me to come up with a test for this. i'm a dumb friggin warrior<br />
<br />
ps. i first noticed the 4x taunt in luclin on mezzed mobs... to *ensure* that the the mob comes after you and only you, i hit taunt 4x before i broke, if time permitted.  to the best of my memory (beerlogged that it is), i've never had a 4x taunt fail, unless someone snuck a slow in there or a heal on me in the meantime.<br />

Did some testing last night w/ a guildie chanter... pulled some protectors in sol ro with proximity aggro only, had chanter mez one and killed the other.  Then had chanter boggle the mezzed one (which had not been hit at all to that point).  Took 5 taunts to get it off her after the mez break.  Repeated, this time with no boggle, mob spun on first try.  Will be repeating the above tests soon to make sure it's systematic and not just a coincidence.<br />
<br />
I'm thinking that the aggro reducing AAs/spell effects/buffs aren't coded well and are causing one of the hate/aggro lists to wrap negative, the same way factions used to wrap.  Limit checking, for whatever reason, has never seemed to  be much of a priority for MUD/MMORPG programmers...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frodlin7th</div><div class="date">07-30-2003, 10:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I haven't piped up on this thread yet, wanting to see where the chips fall, but there's a couple of things I'm wondering:<br />
<br />
1. Is it possible that having autoattack on is an aggro modifier?   In other words, if you turn your back to the mob and hit attack, then taunt, would there be a greater likelihood of him actually turning on you than without it?<br />
<br />
2. &quot;Proximity aggro&quot; is meaningless if you're not actively on the aggro list by performing an action which generates aggro (Melee, casting detrimental spells on a mob, or casting beneficial spells on a player who is engaged with said mob.   This is a very important aspect which we tend to overlook.  I learned this a couple of ways.  <br />
<br />
A. There used to be a wonderful DPS increaser when using /shield and the druid AA skill &quot;Wrath of the Wild&quot;, since /shield didn't wear off runes, and Wrath of the Wild is a &quot;1 point rune with a 700 point damage shield&quot;, you used to be able to /shield someone with a 700 point damage shield on and it would never wear if you didnt' get hit directly by the mob's melee or a spell.  SOE caught on, and it got taken away, as it should have, but it was great while it lasted.   The thing is, the concept of &quot;AE Rampage&quot; mobs is a little skewed, AE Rampage mobs don't &quot;AE rampage&quot; at all, they rampage everyone within range who is *actively* on the mob's hate list by performing one of the above actions.   Proximity does NOT put you onto the &quot;AE Rampage&quot; list, only being ON the hate list does.<br />
<br />
B. Knowing this, my function while doing RZTW was always that of &quot;second tank&quot;, and what I did was stand right next to the MT and do nothing unless he died.   I was the only person on the raid who was able to stand at his feet and never get touched by his &quot;AE Rampage&quot;, and it was also a clear indicator that I wasn't on the mob's &quot;Hate list&quot;.   If the MT died, I would fire off a taunt, and would usually grab the aggro fromt he whole raid.   If that didnt' work, I'd whip out AE taunt which would ensure I had aggro.    RZ always seemed like an &quot;easy taunt&quot; mob to me, I don't know why.  The point is, I was able to, usually with just taunt, but DEFINITELY with AE taunt go from *not* on the mob's hate list (as evidenced by standing next to him and not getting rampaged at all) to the very top with a taunt over a whole raid.  Maybe Rallos is just really sensitive, I dont' know, but it's something I always have, and most likely always will do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Remf da Troll</div><div class="date">07-30-2003, 11:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heyas-<br />
<br />
The (regular) rampage list and the active &quot;hate&quot; list are separate; it's not a stretch at all to propose that AE rampage uses the active hate list + proximity.<br />
<br />
Determining mob aggro &quot;focus&quot; - i.e. who the mob is mad at at any particular instant, found by /assisting the mob for example seems to be a function of more than just one &quot;hate&quot; list.  It's some calculation based on:<br />
-raw hate list, from damage/spells/debuffs/heals/etc.<br />
-modifiers like:<br />
. sitting<br />
. low health<br />
. &lt;5 seconds to camp<br />
. proximity (distance from center of player to center of mob- where arrows hit them)<br />
. order added to list (suspected, explains &quot;puller aggro&quot; effect)<br />
. others?<br />
<br />
So here's a far fetched idea, with the following wild assumptions:<br />
-Taunt ONLY affects the raw hate list<br />
-the raw hate list uses one variable size definition.<br />
-the taunt modification code uses a different one (or a different bit shift??)<br />
-there is no limit checking on raw hate list modifications from aggro reducer spells/effects/aa's.<br />
<br />
What happens:<br />
-Mob is aggroed, hate list is &quot;initialized&quot; but has low or zero values.<br />
-Some effect (boggle, AA casting aggro reducer, some new hate list aggro modifier, etc) causes hate list value for a player to wrap to maximum by going negative, the same way faction used to roll over/under at extreme values.<br />
-taunt is used, but adds a maximum value of aggro only 1/4th of the actual total due to the mismatched code.<br />
-3 more taunts add the rest, warrior now matches (astonishingly high) aggro value of original player.<br />
<br />
Seems to fit what I've seen, thoughts or comments anyone?  Has anyone seen something fundamentally inconsistent with this?  Fix would be as &quot;simple&quot; as updating the code for taunt to use a variable size consistent with the hate list value.  Oh, and to avoid some pretty obvious sploits, put in limit checking on the hate list.<br />
<br />
Seems to have been &quot;broken&quot; fairly recently too, which has some interesting implications... maybe they are working on hybrid aggro lock and stuff.  <br />
<br />
I think.<br />
RdT.<br />
<br />
EDIT NOTE: might not be a variable size problem, but some type of bit shifting that's going on.  No clue how's it's actually coded, but there's a couple ways that would seem to be consistent with the observed 4-successful-taunts-to-get-aggro phenomena.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I still don't believe in the puller aggro effect, or that the reason for so many taunts was from wrapping.  To me, I've often noticed that it is harder to get aggro from a mob which you haven't done anything directly to.  In all of the tests that people believe show puller aggro, the taunting person had not done anything direct to the mob.  I am currently unable to log on to EQ though, so I can't really test this, but I am fairly certain that if the person swings once (maybe unarmed for least aggro), that the four taunt thing won't happen.  I could be wrong, but it is a variable that few are looking at.  Another possible test would be to use a non kos mob, and see if the mob goes to threateningly on a supposed successful taunt.  As I said, I can't log on to test, but I hope someone will be able to.</div></div><hr />

I think you're on to something. I've noticed the same thing and it definitely is starting to look like a coding error. My money is on your first assumption, that of an aggro wrap around. If people here only realized how many times EQ has been fucked by this wrap around bug, they'd be surprised.<br />
<br />
Monks with -100000 weight that had 1500AC at lvl 35 PRE-Kunark is one that comes to mind. PvPers who would take their charisma below -128 and become totally immune to Rapture (Rapture checked Charisma + MR and when you went sub -128 your CHA would wrap around to some ridiculous # and you'd be totally immune to Rapture - some of you PvPers are probably thinking, &quot;so that's how they did it...&quot;) Etc.... <br />
<br />
So yea, if I were a betting man I'd definitely say this right here is probably what's going on:<br />

Which leads to a super easy way to test this. Get a mob that is Dazzlable, cast Boggle on it as many times as possible before Dazzle wears off, and test 'taunt' on said mob. Reason I say use Dazzle is because of the duration of the spell per cast.</div></div><hr />

If nothing new is posted in a week I'll move it to the archives.<br />

The good thing is that unless the board itself goes under, these threads will not be lost (unlike EZBoard's finite backlog), so no worries there.</div></div><hr />

Get a mob that is Dazzlable, cast Boggle on it as many times as possible before Dazzle wears off, and test 'taunt' on said mob. Reason I say use Dazzle is because of the duration of the spell per cast. <br />
<br />
I'll go run this test right now and slap the log up here.  You guys gotta interpret this though because I haven't been following the thread since like page 4 :)</div></div><hr />

14 Boggles, again, 4 successful taunts to pull it off the chanter.  Sure looks like the hate list wraps to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Remf da Troll</div><div class="date">07-31-2003, 04:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Back when all that hate code was written, there probably weren't any effects that actually lowered the values on the hate list, so there wouldn't BE a way to wrap it... then.  Probably a LOT of variable that don't have proper limit checking, might be a good thing for them to take a look at, with all the new mods going in...<br />
<br />
Or maybe it's just very computationally expensive and they only do it on known-problem calculations.  *shrug*<br />
<br />
Either way, if that's all it is, should be fairly easy to fix.  Pretty exploitable too until they do, so I'd imagine it'll happen sooner rather than later.  Talk about MASSIVE aggro generation. ;)<br />
<br />
Actually, seems like there are TWO errors in their code; lack of limit checking, and a limit on the aggro added by a successful taunt (2 bit shift/offset maybe? 00 01 10 11...)<br />

Standard 4 taunt situation like we've seen from most tests.  This next one to me shows that the reason for 4 taunts is due to not doing any direct aggro to the mob, not due to wrapping or a max hate cap.<br />

Note how he got aggro with 2 misses instead of 3 more taunts.  My belief is that there is a modifier due to having &quot;hard&quot; aggro.  So the first taunt takes you to the top of the unmodified hate list, plus a little bit.  Second taunt you are taunting off of yourself, thus go above yourself plus a little bit.  Same with third.  On the fourth, the last little bit puts you above the aggro of the first person's modifed hate (since they did have &quot;hard&quot; aggro).</div></div><hr />

I've had the &quot;4 taunt&quot; problem with mobs while I was beating the snot outta em; I'm thinking that what you are pointing out is an artifact of the testing.  Shouldn't be hard to repeat test w/ some melee dmg mixed in to verify that.<br />
<br />
Note also, this seems to be a recent problem- I hadn't seen this before the last &quot;big&quot; patch a month or so ago.  I'd guess something got modified (perhaps when they made the potime modifiers actually work? hrm...) that broke the existing aggro/hate code a bit, tho it's possible that the problem has been around longer than that...<br />
