<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Razzo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I saw someone with a quote from Ephesians in their Magelo profile, and was wondering if anyone happened to know who it was. I came back to look for it, meaning to write it down, but I could not locate it.<br />
<br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
I still want Jesus to be a mob for a day so I can kill him for levi shoes and AE Fish and Bread summoning (for people in the steel warrior channel when it came up, we're all going to burn in hell)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">At least we'll be in like-minded company. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">And that makes all the difference!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">AVATAR OF CHRISTIANITY INCOMING!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ye gods, who's tanking that? It probably has an AE &quot;Mind Numb&quot; and procs &quot;Convert&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>daoga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">no, it has a 100% rez proc on death, you never actually get to loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Goska</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I hear he has a 2nd proc that takes 10% of all your cash, on you and in the bank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sivok Kovis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well, on the Jesus thing. Wouldnt it be cool to have Mt what the heck ever it is called, with all the greek gods up there. Would be a really hard camp, have to get up there with Zues hitting you with bolts and water from the water god and then fire and so on. Or if eq did it, would be one in each room with some lousy gaurds and zues at the end as the big boss. maybe we could fight hercules too, quads for 1k comes to mind :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">While I got a chuckle out of this thread, I think maybe in the interests of not being offensive to people who wouldn't understand or apperciate the humor involved, it might be best to drop it, out of respect for the religious beliefs of others?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sivok Kovis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">It would really suck if he cast a swarm of flesh eating lotcus on you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Razzo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Lol, you guys are seriously ADD/love to derail.<br />
<br />
Back on subject, anyone know who has that quote in their profile and could maybe provide a link?</div></div><hr />
