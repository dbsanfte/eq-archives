<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spoon</div><div class="date">04-13-2004, 03:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all,<br />
<br />
I posted a thread on this site a while ago http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=6418&amp;page=1&amp;pp=15 which I thought gave me some good advice. So i decided to look around in bazaar on my site, as I am still running around in mostly gothic steel items.<br />
When I got there I found that the items worth buying were in the range of 100-300k!, I can only manage to save about 800pp lol.<br />
Anyway whilst surfing the net I come across some sites that actually allow you to pay hard cash for items and buy Platinum. This raised a question for me :  Are the prices of items on some servers being kept artificially high to make the buying of items and Platinum a more attractive option?<br />
Or<br />
Is this sort of thing done by most ppl or is there places you can go to raise the cash.  It seems abit stupid for such high prices unless ppl are able to raise the cash?<br />
lol, And<br />
Does the buying of such items take away the spirit in which the game is meant to be played or (as above) is it part of the game?<br />
<br />
I would love to hear ppl's views on this, would be nice to see what other's think.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My understanding is that many of the high end items sold are being sold on toons operated by the same people yer buy the plat from.  And so:  You pay cash for plat, get yer item, giving yer plat back to the guy yer bought it from, who sells it fer cash again.  I would expect that these people (and again, I tripped over rumours that this is so) would push the prices for such things as high as they can, to generate significantly more cash.  Iono if any of this is true, but it's too plausible for me not to believe it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rysingsun1</div><div class="date">04-13-2004, 03:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">my views. there is experience and there is gear.  acquiring each is part of the progression of your toon and each is an integral part of the &quot;game&quot;. you can buy a 65 toon with full gear and 600aa and never play him and boast of your awesome toon but where is the game? or you can play your character from level 1 and just buy the platinum and now you have half a game. well its better than no game at all. but for all the money im shelling out to sony i dont want to be cheated out of half a game so i wont buy the plat either.<br />
<br />
secondly you CAN earn more than 800plat at a time. i can farm probably about 30000 plat (worth of mainly tradeskill bazaar items)  in a very long all day saturday session if i want though i dont have the patience for it. the best exp zones are not typically the best plat zones so if you wonder why your PoP groups arent making you rich .. well PoP isnt in most cases a good &quot;farming&quot; spot.<br />
<br />
if you do the buy low sell high technique inthe bazaar you can make a few k per hour doing it. im not saying you will enjoy it. some love it. some hate it. but its an option among others. those who enjoy doing it like me consider it &quot;part of the game&quot;. it takes a lot of practice to get good at it so if you hate doing it then dont even bother trying.<br />
<br />
you asked if prices are kept &quot;artificially high&quot;. yes and no. a lot of plat scamming over the years and especially late last year has driven up the supply of total plat in the system. more platinum chasing the same number of goods causes inflation. farming of platinum causes inflation but farming of goods causes deflation. platinum sinks (like vendor bought periodots) drop platinum out of the system without decreasing the supply of goods - hence deflation. item sinks (like the tribute system) drop items out of the system without decreasing the supply of platinum - hence inflation. eq over the years has had several periods of both inflation and deflation. the inflation caused by platinum scamming is particularly unfair to those who play fairly because the platinum dumped into the system is not distributed equitably - its distributed to the scammers and if sold for real life money distributed to the cheaters - yes you heard me right i called the plat buyers cheaters.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">irmingnomers</div><div class="date">04-13-2004, 04:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Doggabone you are correct for example lets take FV server which is 99.9% all ebay.  The economy there is so out of wack that a spider fur belt can cost 3k.  You might say that this is because of the trival loot code but if nothing is no drop wouldnt the spider fur belt be sold for like 40pp instead of the high price that it is.  Well this can be traced back to three people on the server (not going to name them) These people control the whole economy they buy up all the high end items and other items and mark them up atleast 2x the normal price.  These people are also involve on selling PP either for Yantis or for themselves.  By raising the the prices on the items to astronomical prices other people follow suit and thus a simple item like the spider fur belt becomes expensive.  Doggabone is true that the people you buy these items is also the same people you bought the pp so you paid them real life $$ for the PP and you gave it right back they dont lose the pp and made $$.<br />
<br />
<br />
YEs, it does take something out of the game. YOu are taking a short cut.  Is it illegal, can it be bannable.  Apparently not. <br />
<br />
<br />
It is up to you.  If you want to spend money for pp just to buy that fungi tunic or that blade of war that is your bussiness.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spoon</div><div class="date">04-13-2004, 07:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">so what can be done about it if no one, even the guys who run the game will do nothing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dags</div><div class="date">04-13-2004, 07:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nothing to be honest, if Sony won't step up and stop them then there is nothing we can do.<br />
<br />
Sony can stop it, ever notice you dont see everquest items or platinum for sale on Ebay?<br />
<br />
It was stopped long ago because they threatened to sue ebay if they continued to allow their items to be sold on the internet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gaylon</div><div class="date">04-13-2004, 09:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ive heard people claim that people like Yantis, etc provide a way for people to get gear, etc they normally would not have gotten and allow them to enjoy the game.  I very much disagree with that.  I am one of those &quot;casual&quot; type players that will never have access to the good stuff, can barely save up 10-20kpp.  Buying/Seling plat, Cheater/Dupers and people like Yantis just make things worse for us since it undoubtably screws with the server economies and making it near impossible for us to buy ingame items at fair prices with PP we have earned honestly and fairly.<br />
<br />
With that said, Sony is definatly at fault here...not because they cant do anything to stop it but rather because they choose not too.  Think about it, with the buying/selling of items/pp/characters those accounts that normally would have just cancelled due to not being able to progress further in game continue to remain active therefore bringing in more money for SOE.  I would wager that SOE somehow has their dirty little paws in businesses like Yantis, etc and are infact profiting from them.<br />
<br />
But for me the buying/selling of Items,PP, Characters for real world $$ seems really &quot;cheap&quot; and takes away what little &quot;fun&quot; and &quot;sense of accomplishment&quot;  the game still offers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">04-13-2004, 09:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Frankly I don’t understand buying in game items for cash. This is a game. Definition of the game you play to have fun or get away from routine of day-to-day life. Why would you spend cash to someone to have fun in game for you? If you don’t like EQ that much that you have to hire people to play for you why are you playing in the first place? The only reason that is valid that I can come up with is to win the dick-measuring contest and show off.<br />
<br />
I actually once overheard a conversation between 2 assholes on the buss who were talking how EQ was their job. How they farm trivial for them items and make cash. I had a bad urge to get up and kick their ass. Basically you are paying for people to bottom feed. You are paying for someone to 6 box AoW so you can never catch him up, to 2-3 box BoT tower and whatever else that you guild should be killing and that is currently in demand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gaylon</div><div class="date">04-13-2004, 09:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also,  there have been alot of debate/discussion about how EQ is &quot;addictive&quot; and like &quot;Drugs&quot;, etc.  For the most part I don't agree BUT when someone enters the realm of buying/selling items for RL $$ then the simalarities become obvious.  Yantis/Sellers = Drug Dealer....Buyers = Drug Users.  SOE = Government.<br />
<br />
And as with the RL drug issues who to blame for the problem is not so clear cut.</div></div><hr />

<br />
While I don't think it's cool to sell plat or anything, I can understand some folks' reasoning for buying it.  If you're new to the game, and you've got friends that have been playing for awhile, wouldn't you want to catch up to them?  If you've got the cash, and you feel you could get more enjoyment out of the game with better items, go for it.  Not everyone has the time to devote to an AoW killing or even BoT.  And if people can continue to keep prices this high, there must be some kind of a demand for it.  Hey, it's great that you have the time/skill/guild/etc that you're content and/or you don't need that kind of money to advance yourself.  Not everyone has that privilage.  <br />
<br />
It's not like high-end droppable stuff is anywhere in the neighborhood of high-end no drop gear anyway.  Be thankful that there are a plethora of people farming that stuff instead of banding together to progress through content and give you some competetion.  Keeps the more difficult encounters open.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sam DeathWalker</div><div class="date">04-13-2004, 09:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'v generated like 3 million plat over time (well I have 6 toons), most of my plat though comes in from jewcraft items. You have to spend time at it (like hour a day at first then maybe 20mintues a day like I do). You have to check prices often and when you see a item unusually low you need the reserves to snatch it up. <br />
<br />
Gear is very overrated. Levels is most important then AA then gear. <br />
<br />
Buying stuff with RL money is ups to you. Some people play golf for &quot;fun&quot;, and some of these for fun people will spend $1000 on one club. I have like $15,000 invested in this game with 6 computers and constant upgrading, dsl, monthly fees and whatnot. Some people are professionals and play golf to put food on their table, for them to spend $5000 on a club is nothing. <br />
<br />
In EQ people post on the boards how Yantis is runing the game and buying stuffs is wrong then one day after they quit you see their toon on PA lol..... <br />
<br />
Video games is the number one entertainment industry in the world, bigger then music or sports or whatnot. You're going to have &quot;fun players&quot;, &quot;hobby players&quot;, &quot;professionals&quot; and &quot;screw this @#$@#$$ job players&quot; and &quot;I love my job players&quot;.... Be what you want to be and let others do as they will.....</div></div><hr />

<br />
/agreed<br />
<br />
The most important thing is for people to have &quot;fun&quot; however they come about it.  But the problem is that buying/selling of ingame stuff undoubtably effects the enconmy, etc...usually in a negative way.<br />
<br />
I admit I have been tempted in the past to fork over RL $$ for PP when i had reached the point where getting upgrades was impossible, but luckily I just quit the game instead.  They introduced LDON which gave players like me a means to get decent upgrades at a pace we can set for ourselves so I came back.    Once i reach the point of frustration (in terms of progression) i will just quit again.  And from the looks of things it will be for the last time as I dont see SOE providing much more for players like me.  (its just not profitable for them).   <br />
<br />
But the one good thing is that since ive sorta stuck to my &quot;principles&quot; i will be so gimp when i quit that selling my account will not be a temptation :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">04-13-2004, 09:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sam I dont agree with your logic. Buying stuff in game(aka plat) is different then buying stuff for the game(aka golf clubs and faster comps). Buying plat in terms of golf is like paying somoene to play first game instead of you in a tournament.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ejryu</div><div class="date">04-13-2004, 10:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Casai, that's ridiculous.  You're paying money in hopes to enhance the enjoyment you derrive from a game/hobby.  With that stretch of an argument, you might as well say that you're paying the guy that made the golf clubs to play for you.  Again, you've got to look at why people do it.  Let's assume you're a casual player, and your best friend Soandso wants to pick up and play.  How is it wrong for him to get twinked up using real cash so that he can join you?  Gearing up like that will give you a slight advantage, but it's not going to turn you into an AE DTing Uqua soloer.  You can pay whatever you want for the golf club, but it's not going to make you Tiger Woods.  I know that I'm still going to be infinitely better than the guy that buys his gear/char.  Personally, I'd rather everyone spend money to get stuff.  That way, I wouldn't have to deal with $^&amp;@tards asking me if I can spare any gear.  Heh, just step back and enjoy it.  Without people spending money and chars coming and going on your server, where would the drama be?  The thrill of The Vision (tm) has long since passed.  If everyone played the game as SoE had intended, I doubt that EverQuest would still be successful today~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">04-13-2004, 10:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's always seemed wrong to me to buy either pp or characters; in both cases you're paying money to avoid playing part of a game. But I could avoid playing for free, lol.<br />
However, the reasons some people sell pp should be obvious. The reasons some people buy pp are a bit more complicated.<br />
Scan the boards here for the answers that lvl 30 or 40 newbies get when they ask what armor or weapons they should be looking for. &quot;Cultural&quot; comes up all the time. Before the recommended level bug was fixed, we'd tell people to go buy CHoS. We'd advise warriors that by the time they were 45 they should have a 31% haste item. then someone else would say 31% sucked--41% would be better, lol. While it may be true that a lvl 60+ warrior can farm thousands of pp in a single day, that's just not going to happen for the vast majority of &quot;first character&quot; warriors, who are strikingly bad at soloing and at the same time heavily gear dependant.<br />
I have a feeling that Pallies and SKs mains who hit their 50s have it almost as bad.<br />
Of course, most toons in their 30s and 40s are alts on most servers. Pretty easy to hop on your main and farm a few thousand pp to twink the alt and then lvl as fast as you can. It seems logical enough to farm pp for your twinks or to do the buy/sell thing in the bazaar, until you realize that it's even faster to buy pp online.<br />
Buying pp is a logical extension of powerleveling, twinking, refusing to level up in any but the highest-zem zones, and so forth. <br />
A couple of months ago I decided that in my spare moments I'd play an alt, and that the alt would be untwinked. I had a troll SK mule (at one point all my warrior's mules were Pallies and SKs, since who better to hold a warrior's bags?).<br />
It's been an eye-opening experience. First, I met a player who has gradually become one of the people I most respect in the game: he's been playing since 1999 and his highest lvl toon is 49. He spends almost all his time helping people and, obviously, almost none of it leveling (except when I can con him into fighting with me--he's an excellent player). He does what he does because he enjoys it and it makes the game more enjoyable for others. You don't see that every day.<br />
The other thing I've noticed is that although I've purposely had to level very slowling in order to let the SK get his own gear (thank Inny for the Troll exp penalty!), his equipment is pretty marginal compared to just about everyone else because on my server just about everyone else is twinked. Fairly often after a while in a pick-up group, a player who is good enough to recognize that my gear is decidedly untwinked will offer to give me some piece of gear they have somewhere.  Of course I refuse, but it's been very nice to see how many people will offer to help.<br />
The last thing I've noticed is this: the last time I logged on the SK, within a couple of minutes, I had tells from five different non-guild people asking me to come play with them. I decided to spend my time helping the person on the CR who needed my &quot;find corpse&quot; spell. No exp, no plat, still not Uber. But I did have fun and I got a free SoW out of the deal (yep: dead toon was a ranger, lol).<br />
And, no, I'm not really sorry for the length of this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The short answer to this question is yes. The long answer gets complex and very debatable, but yes, prices are kept artificially high on quite a few servers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is this sort of thing done by most ppl or is there places you can go to raise the cash. It seems abit stupid for such high prices unless ppl are able to raise the cash?&quot;<br />
<br />
Yes and no. Yes, buying plat/items/accounts is done. It's a successful business venture for the people who are doing it. And though many people on message boards will not publically admit they've bought plat or items or whatever (though a lot will admit they've bought accounts, since it seems less reprehensible to buy an account for your second or third box when you multi-box or whatever) ... just keep in mind that since it is successful ... SOMEONE has to be buying that stuff. However, there's the other side of it too. A level 65 monk like myself has no need for platinum whatsoever. I buy food, drink and gate potions and that's it. So I got lucky with some Sol Ro Tower drops that me and my friends split the profits on and had a huge chunk of plat, but nothing to spend it on. I loathe tradeskills. So I had this mountain of money with nothing to do. In other words, the answer to your question is BOTH.<br />
<br />
&quot;Does the buying of such items take away the spirit in which the game is meant to be played or (as above) is it part of the game?&quot;<br />
<br />
I was going to field this question, but Brabble did such an excellent job explaining the motivation of people who buy plat/items/etc. online that there isn't much I can say about it. <br />
<br />
VERY GOOD POST Brabble. It's one of the few times I've seen someone capture the reasons why people partake of mysupersales.com.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daggorr</div><div class="date">04-13-2004, 02:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kudos on that post Brabble.<br />
<br />
Honestly, twinking, buying plat and gear online.... It really just robs you of the experiance of playing that character. Do I want to be 65 with uber gear and hundreds of AA's? Absolutely.  But I wouldn't trade the experiance of earning my way there by my own hand for any amount of plat or RL cash in the world. I mean really, what good is a finish line without a good fulfilling ride?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wulfran</div><div class="date">04-13-2004, 02:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've always been adverse to the RL buying/selling of characters/items/equipment. Like others have alluded to, it all feels like you are cheating yourself as well as others.<br />
<br />
My character has been almost 5 years in the making. You can see my Magelo profile . He's got decent gear by some standards, gimp gear by others. But the one thing I can say about him, is that everything he is or is not, is because of what I have done with him. Some of his items I have purchased in the bazaar, presumably from other players (although I may have purchased some things from Yantis/IGE people), but my resources have been raised through my actions, my groups, my guild/friends. Yantis, I.G.E. or any other outside agency has not affected my gear, except to the point that their agents have increased competition for some items, by farming them and affected their Bazaar prices.<br />
<br />
To be honest, I do see that as a cockblock: some stuff is farmed out and puts a roadblock in the progression of some newer players. I see it as counter to the spirit of the game. However in SOE's defense how can they &quot;do something&quot; about this without devoting a huge amount of resources, which when you look at the downsizing and outsourcing of the GM staff, is something they are obviously not prepared to do. &quot;Ebaying&quot; or &quot;PAing&quot;is detrimental to the game environment, but not to the point where it has much impact on SOE's business.<br />
<br />
Now as far as raising coin/resources yourself, as a newer player, there are things you can do. As others mentioned, they generally won't involve quick returns/high experience, but rather boring farming. Farming tradeskill components, etc. is a good way to get an initial stake (spider silks, furs, ores, etc all sell) and like anything, once you have a little coin it seems easier to earn more...</div></div><hr />

Sony benefits from all of it more than anyone else or it wouldn't happen.  <br />
<br />
For example--there is some complete jerk on my server that has three characters (shaman, cleric, and paly or war I think) and sits in the bottom of plane of tactics in a safe place where mobs don't path near the pens.  He does nothing, says nothing even if you try to talk to him, just sits there until a pigglet spawns then he will attempt to KS any group that is there trying to get the piglet.  All this guy does all day is try to farm the ornate boot mold and he is very good at it to the extent that he gets it a lot of the time.  There are two ornate boot molds  currently in the bazaar on my server for 190k (I just checked) and 200k which is rediculous compared to the stats on them.  This guy basically is jacking up the prices of ornate, KSing people, cockblocking others from getting boot molds, and sitting there being a complete dick all day long.  When you ask the GMs to do anything they refuse to and give some lame excuse why they won't if they respond at all.  Guys like this ruin the game as far as I am concerned and Sony does nothing.  These kinds of people ruin the economy and inflate stuff for their own greed and there are lots of them out there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The question you have to ask yourself is this. Do you have the money to spend on in game items? Do you feel cheated in doing this? Will your friends in game feel cheated?<br />
<br />
No one can answer these questions for you. They are questions we each have to answer ourselves. Me personally? I would say that 1. I don't have the money, nor do I want to spend my hard earned cash on a digital thing that I can never truely posess. 2. I would feel cheated as I didn't truely earn this. 3. My friends would scorn me for this as again I didn't earn this.<br />
<br />
I guess thats that.<br />

Sony benefits from all of it more than anyone else or it wouldn't happen.  <br />
<br />
For example--there is some complete jerk on my server that has three characters (shaman, cleric, and paly or war I think) and sits in the bottom of plane of tactics in a safe place where mobs don't path near the pens.  He does nothing, says nothing even if you try to talk to him, just sits there until a pigglet spawns then he will attempt to KS any group that is there trying to get the piglet.  All this guy does all day is try to farm the ornate boot mold and he is very good at it to the extent that he gets it a lot of the time.  There are two ornate boot molds  currently in the bazaar on my server for 190k (I just checked) and 200k which is rediculous compared to the stats on them.  This guy basically is jacking up the prices of ornate, KSing people, cockblocking others from getting boot molds, and sitting there being a complete dick all day long.  When you ask the GMs to do anything they refuse to and give some lame excuse why they won't if they respond at all.  Guys like this ruin the game as far as I am concerned and Sony does nothing.  These kinds of people ruin the economy and inflate stuff for their own greed and there are lots of them out there.<br />

Before i took a vacation from EQ about 8 months ago, there was an asswipe that was doing the same thing in the sewers of CT.  I sure was tempted to see how much of the rest of CT i could bring down to the sewers :)<br />
<br />
Sometimes i wonder if things in this game would have been better if everything was  no-drop and nothing was MQuable.  I may still be in crafted but at least i wouldnt be cockblocked from stuff.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No it hasn't.  Hell it only popped in EQ after about 4-5 months went by (I was there).  And it was a shock then that people would actually do this.<br />
<br />
 It's not like high-end droppable stuff is anywhere in the neighborhood of high-end no drop gear anyway. <br />
<br />
But is good enough to make people &quot;insta 65&quot; and buy there way into a raiding guild w/o learning any skill at all.  Again thats a bone of contention.  Part of what makes this game fun is earning your place over time.  This distrupts that.<br />
<br />
 Be thankful that there are a plethora of people farming that stuff instead of banding together to progress through content and give you some competetion. Keeps the more difficult encounters open. <br />
<br />
This is kinda an odd argument: I'd instead say instead that SoE needs to add more CONTENT and not give players a reason to farm.  I also don't think the professional farmer and the raider populations have much intersection anyway.<br />
<br />
These are only my views mind you having been around since March 99 with the same character.  I still have a problem with people who 2-box so you get an idea of how conservative I am on the subject.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the best pp farming i can do an hour is around 2-3k in the best cash camps.<br />
<br />
a lot of people rationalize it by saying ... i can work 2 hours at my job and do what would take me 200 hours in game of grinding.  for those in such circumstances where time does = a buttload of RL money, it might be in their best interests to buy pp online.<br />
<br />
the game is about having fun and investing time though.  i like to keep work and play separate.  whats the fun of buying your way through a game?  in the end all you have is a hefty bill to prove how much &quot;fun&quot; you had &quot;buying&quot; your way there.</div></div><hr />

Sorry, but thats incorrect Flair. I used to play a MUD(text based RPG) by the name of Gemstone.  It was created in 87 and is still around today.  I know for a fact that folks were selling items for RL cash there long before EQ was a gleam in its daddy's eye.<br />
<br />
However, I will grant you that the frequency and scale of it jumped dramatically post EQ.  The only real differance is that EQ took the &quot;black market&quot; aspect and threw it out the window, openly marketing wares in complete disregard to retribution from the company its feeding off of.</div></div><hr />

If a guild lets a person in that doesn't know how to play their class, then that guild is stupid.  Have fun with another zerg body.  And let's say that the person *DOES* somehow manage to turn out to not suck.  Well then isn't that like skipping a few grades in school?  If you can solve large equations, why should you have to play with orcs &amp; flash cards?  Again, I do *not* condone plat buying, but just look at it in a different light.  If you're so concerned about content and what SoE should do, then think about the amount of people that are playing right now with items they bought.  People have come back to the game or just started and because they've had the money to throw around at guys like Yantis, it's another active account.  All of the people that farm have to be logged on or using multiple accounts.  They make sure that the mob is dying whenver it pops.  Again, they *need* subscriptions to do this.  And then when they get banned, they have to get another account activated.  In a bizzare way, I'd be willing to bet that they're doing more good for SoE's cash cow than harm...just not the average player.  Without the &quot;bad'&quot; people, who would we define as the good folks?</div></div><hr />

At my best, I can farm 1.5k an hour... but it's a grind, and not at all what I would consider &quot;fun.&quot;<br />
Did you know that you can buy 2000 plat for $1?... <br />
Is my free time worth more than 75 cents per hour?...<br />
<br />
Personally, I would rather spend my limited time in EQ enjoying an adventure with friends, or hanging out with guildies on a raid.  <br />
<br />
You have to remember that each and everyone of us pays $13 a month just for access to play EQ.  Many of us pay even more so that they can 2 or 3 box.  People have different levels of comfort with the amount they are willing to pay to enjoy EQ.<br />
<br />
People also have different expectations of what the would like to get out of EQ.</div></div><hr />

I suppose that's fair ... your self righteous bastard attitude irritates the hell outta me.<br />
<br />
Everybody's free time is worth better than 75 cents an hour, tho I would have thought one's dignity was a poor trade for plat. YMMV.  The thing about EQ being a community (that's all those other peeps who log on btw, EQ ain't yers exclusively) is that those who buy the plat for cash scootch up the market for the rest of the gamers in the crowd, by supporting those who would monopolize and distort the market.  <br />
<br />
Enough of them buy 50 bucks worth of plat, and uber_pixelbag00 is gonna cost 10K in the bazaar instead of 8K, and further, the competition for content will be skewed by an influx of farmers to generate the items to garner the plat to sell for cash to peeps who in turn buy the items that encourage the farming and sale of items and plat.  Many of us are working shmoes with bills to pay, and shouldn't be expected to dump extra cash just to equip their toons just because a blinkered minority can't be bothered to play by the same ruleset as everyone else.  <br />
<br />
People playing a game collectively should be able to expect each other to play by the rules ... the ones set out by the game designer and/or vendor (btw, this ain't you,  and you don't have the exclusive authority to decide who should follow these rules, in case you missed that memo as well).<br />
<br />
Deal with it.</div></div><hr />

If I have come across as a &quot;self righteous bastard,&quot; that was not my intent, and I appologize.<br />
<br />
But with regards to &quot;following the rules,&quot; ask yourself the following:<br />
Have you ever driven 65 mph in a 55 mph speed limit zone?<br />
Have you ever Jay walked?<br />
Have you ever had a beer before the age of 21?<br />
Have you ever down loaded an MP3?<br />

Is it truly an accomplishment to abide by ALL the rules within a computer game, but not in life?   And then, please remember that all progress throughout our history has been made by visionaries who did NOT follow the rules.<br />
<br />
While you may view me, as a person without dignity, I view myself as someone who is accutely aware of the value of his time.  I don't have time to wash my car, thus I pay a detailing service to do it for me.  I do not have time to mow my lawn, so I pay a lawn mowing service to take care of that.  I don't have time to change my car's oil, so I pay Jiffy Lube to do that.  In all cases, I'm paying for a service.  It's classic labor theory.  There is no indignity in that.<br />
<br />
Regarding items which used to sell for 8k, and now sell for 10k, I am sure you are correct, and the price of certain items has gone up.  But the more prevailant trend in the history of EQ is that the price of items goes Down.  Just a few short months ago, the standard price for a Sword of the Bloodsworn was 20k on my server.  Now they regularly sell for 5-6k.  I would argue that deflation is the more common trend.  <br />
<br />
These angry sentiments suggest that this Yantis and PlayerAuctions.com is responsible for the moral decay of society, and will ultimately culminate with the end of the world as we know it.  <br />
<br />
Relax.  It's just a game.</div></div><hr />

Well said... Like another member posted earlier, I was brought back into the game by my friends. Some no longer are even in the country (military) so this is a way of getting together. My character was far behind in gear and to get back to playing with them, who are all 60-65, I took what many consider the easy way. I don't feel any less of a person and I know that I have some things to learn with my warrior due to my rapid progression. I always inform groups and I take advice and criticism from fellow players. Do I think I am a less of player for it, no. Would I rather spend time playing EQ with my friends and learning my character as opposed to spending time (I don't really have) getting my gear up to speed, so as to not be a detriment? YES!!!<br />
<br />
My enjoyment from EQ is derived from the socializing with my friends in the game and making new ones. Unfortunately, the game has degressed to many power-gamers and a great deal of guilds won't even recruit people without some (what I consider lame) restrictions or prerequistes. When I played the game, you could just shout out and recruit people to come help you with a quest. Now, everyone has 2-3 boxes and normally won't even let you in their group b/c they want to hydra their alts. So the game has changed in many ways and I will do whatever I want with my time and money to enjoy EQ. Is it in the spirit of the game/ I guess the opinions will very on that one. If it to get together with friends and overcome obstacles, then yes, I am still in the spirit of the game. I don't see how saving myself some game deminished that in any way.<br />
<br />
Oh, I also pay someone to mow my lawn b/c I have asthma. Does that make me any less proud of having a nice yard? No, I work hard for my money and I put my money to work for me. I am sure that my lawncare service appreciates my business.</div></div><hr />

Yes but what you fail to grasp is that with the exception of possibly the MP3 download, your &quot;rule violations&quot; don't affect anyone else, and that there is a possible penalty for them as well. Utilizing Yantis/IGE/Playerauctions/etc has no realistic chance of incurring a penalty and as stated above, it does affect to some degree, the enjoyment of those who don't agree with your lack of ethics. What you condone DOES have a negative impact for others but they're not you, so they don't matter, right?</div></div><hr />

I don't know about all the negative impact you are speaking of. The platinum was made and in circulation so the inflation value is still there. And I am sure that the players that sold their Cobalt armor,CHoS, SotB, GSoT, Cloak of Flames, etc are quite happy about it. Who knows, you sell any good items lately? Maybe they bought their plat and I am sure you won't be complaining about the extra 50K plat in your character's bank. Truth is this all happens behind the scenes and somehow I doubt any of you are so devoted to this issue as to be screening players in the bazaar about where they got their cash. It's a hobby and a game, people complain about it in the Card Games like Magic and Warlord all the time b/c they didn't get the limited edition card or weren't willing to spend $100 for a rare card. Let people spend their money however they want. If one of these auction sellers are in a camp you want for a few days straight, ask them to give it up (they probably don't want undue attention), contact a GM, or get your friends and guildies and just go yank it from if all else fails. When the GM finally shows, let him sort it out.<br />
<br />
Of course, you could always just save up some plat and buy it when he sells it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I quite dissagree.  The other rule violations to which I'm referring do have a dramatic impact on others.<br />
<br />
There is a direct correlation between speed of vehicular traffic, and highway accidents and fatalities.  Also a direct link between Jaywalking and pedestrian / vehicular collision fatalities.  Not only do these issues have the potential of ending your life, they also raise the premiums on ALL of our car insurance policies.  And trust me, they are too high already.<br />
<br />
It's argued that early exposure to alcohol can act as a gateway drug, leading to further drug abuse, addiction or alcoholism.  Regardless of whether or not you subscribe to this particular theory, you must acknowledge that alcoholism and drug abuse are significant blights on our society.<br />
<br />
The MP3 issue you've acknowledged.<br />
<br />
And if more husbands/boyfriends recieved more hummers... there would be less war and conflict in the world.  (ok, this might be a stretch, but who doesn't want more of these?)<br />
<br />
Indeed, the other &quot;rule violation&quot; examples i've illustrated have a much GREATER impact on our community.<br />
<br />
Regarding the lack of enforcement for the EQ virtual property transactions in RL... well, that opens a different series of issues, which I will happily expand upon later.... when it's not so late here.</div></div><hr />

Do you really tie your sense of dignity to what happens within a computer game?<br />
No, that'd be absurd.  I tie it to how I co-operate within the communities and groups I live in.  MMOG's have a nifty twist in the way they operate like miniature or shadow variants of the real thing.<br />
<br />
Yer examples are a wee bit off, but not so radically that I don't see the point in em.  I often do 130 in a 100, but I don't ride up someone's bumper just cuz I'm in a hurry, and if I'm not in a hurry I don't do 100 in the passing lane.  I can get where I wanna be without obstructing anyone else or imposing on them.  I'm not much for peeps who piss in the pool and tell me the water is clean enough.  There is no indignity in paying someone to mow yer lawn ... there is, however, in letting the clippings drift over onto your neighbour's walk and leaving them there for him to clean up.  I'm pretty certain you wouldn't pay your landscaper till he cleaned up the mess, either. Dignity is about how we impact the people around us, and how we recognize the impact and balance it with our own needs.  The fulcrum for that balance differs for each of us.<br />
<br />
I learned my toon, caught up my gear, and socialized with peeps without spending cash on plat.  This does not reflect the value of my time in any way, but rather my preference for how I spend it, and the values I claim from it.  Those are my choices, and better for me than the ones others have made, perhaps.  But not inherently better, and likely not better for anyone else than their own choices.<br />
<br />
At any rate Saeborne, you were barking and didn't seem to know why people get as upset as they do about the whole plat selling issue.  From my side, yer were pissing in the pool and hollering that the water was fine, and I decided to lay out my annoyance.  And you've responded well and fairly; as it happens you completely defy my initial reaction to your invective.  I don't think your wrong, btw, although I do disagree with you at points - opinions are funky like that.<br />
<br />
I do agree with the inferrance that this ranks somewhere below the bottom of a long list of things that actually matter tho.  Yantis isn't the one responsible for the moral decay of society - that's actually Zamfir.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ghalion Darkscale</div><div class="date">04-16-2004, 03:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I bought platinum once on the Firiona Vie server cuz I just wanted to roleplay with some friends and it wasn't my main server. It TOTALLY ruined the game for me for a few months, it was just too easy (same could be said for the PoK but we'll leave that alone). Having done it I can't say &quot;Joo are bad and evil for doing so&quot; but I would never do it again. I know someone that has spent hundreds of real life dollars on platinum and thus has powerleveled their characters with gear and then wonder why at level 65 they don't know how to do as much as the next person. Some people do it moderately because they have little time to play and only really want to spend that time raiding or grinding /shrug. To each their own.<br />
<br />
Take it into consideration though that all your hard earned cash and your hard earned time on the account you buy platinum on can very well be &quot;poofed&quot; and Sony does not need to tell you why or even answer your emails concerning it. A friend recently bought a second account and transfered 300k he had earned over a 9 month period to it so he could outfit his twinks, Sony took the 300k and said if he didn't stop emailing them he would lose his account. So they have something in place to notice when large amounts of cash transfer around. Just be careful, to me its not worth it, and now its really not worth it if I'm going to lose all my hard work.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The big thought is in response to the person telling me that this has only been a short going problem. You were corrected but allow me to give my point.<br />
<br />
Ultima Online. I used to sell houses in this game as well as gold. (This was before EQ and after EQ started.) Thus the MMORPG Digital Item for RL Cash market has been around forever.<br />
<br />
Now having been one of the evil people who sold stuff and I will admit I even bought stuff in UO if it was cheap just so I could rerun it for profit. As someone else said though. It ruined it. The game was trivialized for me.<br />

I believe if I went out and bought 1 mil plat for EQ today and a Cleric Hydra and Shaman Hydra (as this seems to be the norm for a warrior). I would in essence be turning this into another pissing contest of who can have the biggest toy. I would also be ruining the spirit of the game. (IF it has any spirit left.)<br />
<br />
Oh btw to the guy who has his lawn mowed (not the asthma sufferer) and claims to take great pride in it. I offer you this. My step Father maintains their lawn with imaculate detail and precise care. Now do you take as much pride in your imaculate lawn knowing you Bought it as he does knowing that he put blood sweat and tears into it? The same applies to all we do in life.<br />
<br />
Taking the easy route as it is called has become a way of life for everyone. (EQ only shows that in a minor way.) I.E. PoP books Luclin spires need I go on? Dignity and pride are not as important as being number 1 at whatever cost.<br />
<br />
Just remember when you are number 1 that if you paid for it you didn't truely earn it and it won't feel as good as when number 2 pass's you buy for number 1 and earned it.<br />

Great example is the piglet that is camped 24/7 if there was no cash ppl who actually are at the right level to be in tactics could enjoy their time there much more fully. People whose job is to play EQ don’t give anything back to the community (at least in my experience), they not the kind of people I want around. Anyone paying cash to them encourages them to step on my and tons of other people's toes who want to try gear up/try new content, which becomes unavailable indefinitely because of this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm sure your lawn looks terrific, as I'm also certain that the lawn care gives your father a great sense of accomplishment.  I would venture that your father considers landscaping one of his hobbies, and derrives significant enjoyment from it.<br />
<br />
For me, keeping the lawn trimmed is neither a hobby, nor a source of pride.  It's a necessary chore, that I do not have time for... and quite frankly, a chore that I detest (used to mow lawns in high school for extra cash...  I've grown to hate it.)  I don't consider my lawn a source of pride any more than the fact that my dry cleaner presses my shirts well.  Please understand that the lawn mowing example was given to emphasize labor theory.  That it is common to pay for services which exceed an individual's available free time.  <br />
<br />
And no, I do not take pride in the virtual items that my character may carry.  At the end of the day, that Uber_breastplate_0773 is simply an entry in SOE's database...  which will one day be deleted.  These are not family heirlooms to be cherished.<br />
<br />
I do however, take pride in the fact that I enjoy the time I spend with friends online.  That I enjoy helping them with thier epic quests. Or simply griding out xp while joking around.  Or finishing a buzzer beater LDoN, and jumping for joy with them.  Some are RL friends, others are guildies who I will probably never meet.  I absolutely adore some of these people, and truly enjoy the time I spend with them.  That is where I find the &quot;fun&quot; in EQ.  Which is what I meant by different people play the game for different reasons.<br />
<br />
If I were to ever make a magelo, you would see that alot of my gear is pure crap.  I still use the warrior epic, for god sakes!  How many 62 warriors do you know that still wear some crystal chitin garbage?  I say this to illustrate that gearing up is not the top priority of my toons.  But once in a blue moon, when something catches my eye, $10 for 20,000 plat isn't bad value for my dollar.<br />
<br />
I think Thelgar's point about selling items in game is very valid.  We often focus on the down side of selling plat.  And yes, I acknowlege that there are a few negative effects.  However remember when you ugraded to No Drop uber_breastplate_0439, and you were able to sell your old one for 25k plat?  It's very possible that that plat was purchased at any number of sites with actual cash.  The influx of plat doesn't necessarily bother us when we are selling items.<br />
<br />
And Doggabone, my friend, on the last point we certainly agree.  Selling plat for cash isn't the end of the world.  That would be Bush's 2004 re-election.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bonequest</div><div class="date">04-16-2004, 12:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just a comment on the guy camping the piglets. This guy is a pro, you claim he is KS'ing you but seems to me its his camp, you don't have to be in an unsafe area to claim a camp do you? All you have to do is call the camp and be able to kill the mob. Guy is there 24/7 how can anyone claim its not his camp? And he is not holding 2 camps, he is camping one mob... <br />
<br />
If its not fair then KS him ... how can 3 toons do more damage then a full group? <br />
<br />
One advantage of pvp server, if you were not on his team and didn't like what he was doing you could just go in and kill him lol....<br />
<br />
He doesn't do anything but wait for &quot;OTHER PEOPLE&quot; to spawn the piglet.  He doesn't clear the stables or do anything if he is alone.  He is a parasite.  When you are clearing the stables to get the piglet to spawn and you are activly killing in that spot, it is normally considered the &quot;piglet camp&quot; by just about everyone on the server.  For example:  If you were killing placeholders on AC island trying to get the AC to spawn and some guy sat there and waited until it poped and killed it while you were engaged with another mob then wouldn't you be a little upset?  If you were in Sol A killing goblins to spawn that cleric epic guy and some buttplug was sitting there next to you and stole him as soon as he poped and did nothing while you killed placeholders for 10 hours wouldn't that be a little irritating to you?<br />
<br />
The only way I can see you thinking he is in the right on that is that you probably do it yourself and that really doesn't surprise me considering what a quality person you are.</div></div><hr />

Not sure if it's like this on all servers, but on Veeshan it is, but there's somebody selling all of the no drop items off two of the BoT lords. He put the items for sale, and logs on your character and loots the item when it drops. I don't deal with the BoT lords anymore but i'm guessing this person has the two that he's sellling drops from permacamped with a 6 box team or something close. This is a prime example of where sony needs to step in and start banning accounts.</div></div><hr />

Does Sam have tactics access? That could be why he didn't know the details of the piglet camp.<br />
<br />
Methinks there's a breakdown in communication between you two is all. Sam probably didn't know what you were describing and thought the person was 6-boxing a particular camp day and night.<br />
<br />
Whereas what you meant was, the person was waiting to KS the people actually camping the piglet and then hiding behind the Play Nice Policy that CS designed to not have to deal with issues of this exact nature.</div></div><hr />

Well, although I don't agree with everyone and everything said, some very valid points were brought up for me to think about and I do appreciate the various perspectives illustrated. As for those perma-camping a spot. If you are on Saryrn, look me up and we will start logging the complaints together. I agree that is wrong and definately not in the spirit of the game. I would like to think that if I was in business harvesting items like that, that when a group came along I would decide that was a good time to take my significant other out for dinner or go catch a movie. I am all for people finding creative ways to make money but not at the expense of being courteous and decent. I now think I sound a little hypocritical at this point so I will go ponder this topic a while longer.</div></div><hr />
