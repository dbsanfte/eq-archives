<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sarelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My guild has recently entered EPs but the question of PoTime came up (someone suggested that we might not want to go there - yeah right! lol) and I wanted to give them firm info on how the zone works.<br />
<br />
- Does an instance allow 72 people now rather than 36?<br />
- Is an instance &quot;yours&quot; until it expires or can others zone in when you leave?<br />
- How far along can a guild typically get when they first get there and how much time will it take them?<br />
- How many instances can be up at once or how quickly can instances be created?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Coray</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It's always been 72 people.  And yes an instance is yours, no one else barring bugs can enter your instance.  It takes a bit to get used to how things work so it varies by guild how long it takes them to progress.  <br />
<br />
No one knows of any limit to the number of total instances and I doubt there is one, it's tracked per person, not for raid/guild.  Your last question is sort of weird and I think you need to understand how the instances work.<br />
<br />
First they aren't instances, it's more like flags, and like I said its per person.  PotimeB is set to the 'instance' of the first person to zone in.  So if they have are flagged as having been there for phase 3 in the last week or so, when they zone in, it's setup so that after phase 1 is cleared, phase 2/3 will also be empty and you can run right in.  Anyone who has been flagged as going farther than phase  3, say they were there for a Terris kill would not be able to zone in.<br />
<br />
Each 'flag' resets in around 6 days, and they're tracked seperately, so it isn't the case that it all respawns every 6 days.<br />
<br />
And because it isn't instanced, only one raid can be in timeb at a time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sarelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks for that. Makes a lot more sense now.<br />
<br />
BTW, I am convinced that it was originally a 36 person limit. I am sure I read a &quot;rant&quot; by Furor about it on the FoH website back when the zone was first being explored.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ragnarz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">there is a body limit in PHASE 1 and 2.<br />
<br />
in phase 3 and beyond you can have 72<br />
<br />
and to the best of my knowledge you can only have 2 instances active at any given time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Krassus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">that cleared some of my ?'s up, were Coirnav away and going in blind so it will be interesting. Here are my questions -<br />
<br />
1) how long can people zone into PoTime after you do p1 trials ? like were an EST guild with PST, they usually log on midway into our raiding.<br />
<br />
2) how do you assign what 72 people get into time if your guild has more than 72 on ? We usually have 70ish on normal raids sometimes less, but when we call otm to something new or Xegony, Rathe, Coirnav sometimes 100 will be on and suddenly every lost person is back.<br />
<br />
3) how will Euro guilds on server effect our instancing ? we only have one american guild in time. So if i understand right as long as we arent in Time at the same time were GTG.<br />
<br />
4) p2+3 not more than 36 can die ? or 36 is max to do trials ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
They can be added in at any time as long as you keep to the player limit on phase 1-2. The /raid can be maxed to 72, people just bench warm in Time A until called.<br />

2) how do you assign what 72 people get into time if your guild has more than 72 on ? We usually have 70ish on normal raids sometimes less, but when we call otm to something new or Xegony, Rathe, Coirnav sometimes 100 will be on and suddenly every lost person is back. <br />
<br />
You can have a /raid inviter sit in A to invite people. We often change things around when we are overflowing.<br />
<br />
3) how will Euro guilds on server effect our instancing ? we only have one american guild in time. So if i understand right as long as we arent in Time at the same time were GTG.<br />
<br />
Yep, you are good to go. <br />
<br />
4) p2+3 not more than 36 can die ? or 36 is max to do trials ? <br />
<br />
36 is the max on phase 1. You can have a full 72 for 3.<br />
<br />
Like someone said before, the limit is to how many people are in B, not just the raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bonehammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">We use 54 for Phase 1 and 2, and move to 72 in Phase 3 as more arrive.  I have not paid enough attention to know if there is a limit beyond 54 in those phases.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Chatja ogre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">There are 5 phase 1 trials. Each can contain up to 18 people. <br />
<br />
Imagine there is 5 small rooms (Phase 1 trials), that lead into 3 bigger rooms. 4 phase 1 trials leads to the same 2 rooms.<br />
<br />
<br />
There are the same 5 areas in phase 2. But 2 of them connect, so you can zone 36 into thos and work on them together. 1 of them is alone and you can only have 18 in there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm an idiot</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nyvan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">You can get 72 people into tier two if you have the rest of the raid sitting in pota zone into trials that are unoccupied when tier 2 opens and invis over to everyone.</div></div><hr />
