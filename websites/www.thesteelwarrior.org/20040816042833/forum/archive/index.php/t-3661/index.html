<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Go watch someone quad kite for a couple of hours (say a wiz in elementals, should you have the access)...<br />
<br />
And then tell me why he (or she) can mitigate better than any melee class in the game?<br />
<br />
I think we have let ourselvs be distracted by the &quot;melee balance is coming&quot; and focusing too much on agro issues, when we should also be looking at caster/melee balance.<br />
<br />
Tell me what my defensive advantage is when I take hundreds of thousands of HP of damage and a wizard takes...0?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">That wizard must have been using their Skin line of spells, which negates a set amount of damage based on level and spell (each cast of which costs a peridot). Should that Skin wear off, they'd drop like a dress on prom night.<br />
<br />
Wizard defense caps at 145, iirc, and their dodge is a whopping 75. Add to that the silk mitigation table and you've got classes that may take a few hits, but that's it.<br />
<br />
There is a certain amount of skill in quadding, less for a druid than for a wizard (both of which I play and enjoy). Think of quadding like an eternal game of &quot;gingerbread man.&quot; The wizard or druid runs around singing &quot;Can't catch me! Can't catch me!&quot; while dishing out a sickeningly high amount of damage.<br />
<br />
But, like I said, one lag spike or a poorly timed spell and it's all over. A quad can eat through a wizard and their Skin in seconds. I wouldn't worry about their mitigation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I could mitigate as much damage as them if I ran around the whole time. Wouldn't that really be avoidance? ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hence the gingerbread man analogy. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Class should be balanced because what they can do not because they weatherlag better. ^_^<br />
<br />
But still that is the point.  If you never lose HP you never have to worry about recovery.<br />
<br />
My favorite balancing idea is to plainly make a certain segment of monsters shoot at their target till they close the distance.  Another idea would be to design a little intelegence into some of the monsters.  If they recognize they are being kited they change their tactics to something else but blindly trying to catch up to the caster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It's the &quot;dumb agro&quot; problem.  I don't see why more mobs don't get ranged attacks other than casting spells, or bring in friends if they realize they're being kited. :D<br />
<br />
That'll kill quadding easily</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kadah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Uhrlik, My brutha, preach on about those prom dresses!.<br />
You sound like you have a 200skillcap on that subject ^-^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I never made it to my prom. I'll let you draw your own conclusions as to why. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kadah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">A promdress was being used as a roof for your convertable?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grobble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The shield spell doesnt actually require a peridot ;)  Those before it in the spell line do though.  Basically it's a 750pt. rune with a little mana regen thrown in, which most PoP mobs will break through in a round.<br />
<br />
Kiting like that does have quite a risk factor.  As was said, the mobs will most likely chew through the wiz if he/she actually gets hit.  Additionally, many PoP mobs can be very immune to snare at times, and if snare drops or gets resisted a few times, you could be in for a load of trouble with 4 angry mobs behind you.  Then you have to get your corpse and sit around medding.<br />
<br />
As a necro I can't quad-kite (at least not efficiently at all) but we have similar risks.  Lag spike will prob equal a mob standing there beating on you for a few seconds.  It's even worse if you're sitting down when it happens because you get hit for max.  In tactics I've had a string of 11 consecutive resisted snares.  Given, with FD and DA we have a few more options than a wiz, but it can still turn ugly fast.  In a group you have someone to save your ass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shadowfrost</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Most humanoid melee mobs should carry bows, just like most melee characters do.  More animal mobs should also be given ranged attacks.<br />
<br />
As for intelligent behaviour, that probably isn't going to happen any time soon.  But how about this for a bandaid on the problem:<br />
<br />
In some zones, some of the intelligent monsters are Watchers, and when attacked, instead of charging at their foe, they'll run off and grab reinforcements.  (In other words, when first aggroed, they behave as if feared for a minute or so.)<br />
<br />
That wouldn't hurt groups; they would deal with Watchers by putting its nearby friends out of action with Lull or Mezz, rooting the monster, and then snaring it before attacking.  But it would make monster behaviour slightly less retardedly predictable, and it would seriously cause a problem for quadders.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tugurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">My bard friend regularly rolls into PoV, pulls the WHOLE ZONE and SOLOS IT. He gets anywhere between 50-80 mobs, drags them out to the desert, and just runs them in circles until they are all dead. He earns from 2-3 full AA per pull, which takes him 20-25 minutes from start to finish. He never takes a lick of damage.<br />
<br />
That's a joke.<br />
<br />
I think of it as the &quot;Thott effect&quot;. Someone at SoE must actually have read Thott's little essays, even though nearly every one of them is very seriously flawed -- he's wrong about nearly every major claim he makes. Anyway, bards are gods now, grats bards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Well when I say &quot;intelegence&quot; I mean do something other than trying to catch up to the person they have no hope catching.<br />
<br />
My ultimate dream: monsters smart enough to kite solo-ers. ^_^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Hyardgune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Ok, the bards getting 2-3 AA off kiting the whole zone, that is just damn stupid.  Bad enough that they are a waste of good steel plate.<br />
<br />
To the original question as to why casters get the best mitigation, let me introduce you to a military concept called &quot;artillery.&quot;  These are long range weapons that sit a few miles behind the front and pour explosives on to distant targets.  While the grunts at the front take the beatings, the guys humping shells five miles back are the ones doing the most damage.  Casters = artillery.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Aah, but isn't it true you can only setup artillery on ground you control?  So where in any zone is ground the player controls for soloists?<br />
<br />
Simply put, a huge majority of monsters are melee only.  No wonder why they get owned at range.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Alas, the quadder would already be quadding his buddies :)<br />
<br />
I play numerous classes and have done the quad kite deal.  I must admit that I don't see the rage about it.  I mean, if we're upset that warriors cannot quad kite, then we need to be upset that they don't get spells... that they cannot CH or lay hands.<br />
<br />
To think that there is no downside to quadding in elemental planes is kinda silly.  You die and now you have to get back to your body and work out a rez.  Now, if we say that 'well, he'll have a cleric with him', now he's not soloing anymore, he's grouping.<br />
<br />
Quadding is not so completely trivial.  You can leave and get sow every hour when it runs out (except druids of course), else you rely on run3 or if crazy on a horse/lizard.  You ride the hairy edge quadding as you will drop in a single round.  Now, if we say well this guy is decked to the nines and he has 6K hp in gear, then guess what?  Now we're done to a handful of 6k hp quadders who can do this crazy ass crap.  <br />
<br />
Imho, having all mobs with range attacks is completely silly.  I hate pulling casters that simply sit there and chain cast and won't let me pull them back to my party.  I tolerate it because they are casters after all, although they hit for 4x what my warrior does and triple &amp; double hit me enough to make me think there are 4 mobs there.  They should come and be happy to get the smackdown and not waste my precious time!  :)<br />
<br />
I'd be less worried about what folks can do and more concerned with classes not able to do what they're supposed to do.  Warriors are supposed to be tanks, that would imply they can keep aggro on themselves so they can do that job.  Quad kiting does not impact that, it impacts grouping.  That has been 'fixed' by 'nerfing' the exp gotten by a single person killing vs a single group's exp bonuses.  Simply said, it shouldn't be worth their time unless they simlpy cannot get a group or just want to fart around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Krowbar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">This is the main problem in EQ currently imo and has been somewhat remedied in LDoN. Prior to LDoN most of the time casters would just charm or quad exp all the time even after the &quot;nerf&quot; which reduced their exp rate from 1 aa in 11 minutes to 1 aa in 20 minutes. (My exp rate in elementals was around 30-45 minutes). This resulted in very few conventional exp groups being formed which is what caused so much competition for the &quot;tank&quot; spot.  Luckily shaman did not have this fast exp track for PoP which was great for the few groups that actually formed. I can probably count on one hand the number of PoP exp groups I had with a chanter, necro or druid in it.<br />
<br />
When I used to form exp groups, I'd get tells from melee and cleric/shaman (and a mage) for a spot. <br />
<br />
This doesnt happen much anymore now that everyone in my guild is on the LDoN bandwagon and everyone gets groups all the time. But, for the guilds whose members are still looking to amass AA's by hitting PoP, I bet it persists.<br />
<br />
My suggestion to Sony is this: Get people off the solo train and into groups in all expansions. That will greatly reduce the class balancing complaints. (Since you have less time to ponder your class's weaknesses when you're busy in a group.) Give all mobs ranged damage. (Oh and this eliminates &quot;pulling&quot; too, another concept that is undesirable.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Zukobim AB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">The quadkite problem is not really a problem with the quadkiters mitigation, but instead our old problem with pure melees being out of balance.<br />
The mobs that are target for quadkiters are pure melee mobs.<br />
Pure melees should have better resists both for PCs and NPCs, so a quadkiter would get resists more often, not necessary complete resists, but just partial resists that makes it sometimes fail due to mana problems.<br />
<br />
Range weapons would be a nice addition to melee mobs, but some randomness like a 0-0.5 sec stand still after firing it as a way to break trains/quad-targets up. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Alas, the quadder would already be quadding his buddies :) Unless he knew to get more than 3 others.  There's ways around that, you know.<br />
Quadding is not so completely trivial.  You can leave and get sow every hour when it runs out (except druids of course), else you rely on run3 or if crazy on a horse/lizard. They do make SoW potions, you know.  People do in fact use those.<br />
Imho, having all mobs with range attacks is completely silly.How so?  Monsters are dumb...but I do not see why ALL of them have to be as dumb as some of the kiters I've seen.  You're telling me that mobs in Plane of Tactics cannot do anything but play &quot;Chase the Kiter&quot;? Or simply cast spells on the Kiter?  That's kinda going against the idea of them being in the Plane of Tactics.<br />
I hate pulling casters that simply sit there and chain cast and won't let me pull them back to my party. Well you see that's a little different than the Range attack that's been suggested.  Rangers can use range attacks while moving...it's called bow-kiting.  Warriors can too, just not as effective.  Any character that can throw something can use a range attack while running.  The idea suggested is that the mob would do it's normal running around, but if it couldn't reach the person for whatever reason, it'd still have a way to do some damage.  Casters stop. yes, but they can't move while casting.  Just make sure it's not coded where they stop within range and just ONLY use range...the suggestion was some mobs would use range attacks while they were trying to close the distance.<br />
<br />
<br />
And come to think of it...why can't we have bard mobs?  That'll drive everyone crazy!  Even snared they'll still be halfway across the zone before you can do anything. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I think we need to focus our efforts a little more realistically. Lashing out at quad kiters as well as knights may make us look like we're just whiny brats taking our ball and going home. :p<br />
<br />
I do agree that bards are significantly overpowered, but wizards and druids are not our problem, there is inherent risk in quad kiting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>richardkent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Unless he knew to get more than 3 others. There's ways around that, you know.<br />
<br />
Ahh, well there isn't really an easy away around it based on the original author's idea.  His concept was that they'd go get friends to assist and this would NOT impact a group, because:<br />
That wouldn't hurt groups; they would deal with Watchers by putting its nearby friends out of action with Lull or Mezz, rooting the monster, and then snaring it before attacking. But it would make monster behaviour slightly less retardedly predictable, and it would seriously cause a problem for quadders.<br />
<br />
However, if the mob can just run off and get even more buddies, now you have groups that have to somehow keep half dozen + mobs lulled/pac/rooted/off-tanked.  The point is that it wouldn't stop quadding, it would impact groups.  In fact, this kind of behaviour would make quadding even easier, as you now get auto-pulls and don't have to run around with full speed mobs while you get the other 3 mobs together.<br />
<br />
You're telling me that mobs in Plane of Tactics cannot do anything but play &quot;Chase the Kiter&quot;? Or simply cast spells on the Kiter?  That's kinda going against the idea of them being in the Plane of Tactics.<br />
<br />
I'd think being in the plane of tactics that these mobs should be allowed to get fatal blows in.  I mean, they spend all their time training, so why not give them an instant death blow?  That'd spice things up, but at the same time make things silly.  I'm not talking DT here, I'm talking about innate chance to strike a fatal blow on someone every round!!  But, if SOE did that, I'd doubt it would go over very well...  yeah, challenging, but in the end, kind of stupid, like giving everything range attacks.  :)  Or perhaps they should be immune to melee damage.  I mean, they practice hitting themselves with swords all day long, so no matter what kind of a weapon you have it would only do 1damage!!  Yeah, you'd need casters to nuke them down!! :)<br />
<br />
Well you see that's a little different than the Range attack that's been suggested.  Rangers can use range attacks while moving...it's called bow-kiting.  Warriors can too, just not as effective.  Any character that can throw something can use a range attack while running.<br />
<br />
I know what bow-kiting is, I know you can shoot while running.  But, I've never had a mob shoot his bow at me or hit me from range except by using spells.  Who knows how hard it would be for them to implement this, probably not all that easy.  Not to mention, bow damage on a non-ranger is pretty sad and doubtful that would solve the issue listed here.  Unless we make them do 500dmg, in which case just make them a caster....  Bards are a different ball of wax, we're talking quadders here... bards are quad+.  Also, the assumption that they'd add bow dmg and not make the mobs constantly bow at you while in range, is like saying casting mobs wouldn't do that.  Alas, they do.<br />
<br />
And come to think of it...why can't we have bard mobs?  That'll drive everyone crazy!  Even snared they'll still be halfway across the zone before you can do anything. :D<br />
<br />
Now you're onto something.  They're just not creative enough to code the issues that'd be present.  I do like the idea of the bard kiting an entire raid around the zone ;)<br />
<br />
Lastly, I guess I still fail to see how any of this hurts warriors in any shape or form.  Yeah, we cannot quad, but we cannot do a ton of other things...  where does it stop.  Why do folks feel the need to beg for the 'nerf stick' because they feel something is unfair?  Just take and make a wizard and quad kite and work it outta your system.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Its not really anger that got me to post this, but to really point out how broken things are. A disadvantage that never (or rarely) comes into play is not a disadvantage.<br />
<br />
To say things like &quot;the classes are not fundimentally out of balance&quot; needs to be compaired with the reality of soloers taking out mobs that hit for 1k+ while those classes that have the 'advantage' of HP and AC, in reality get screwed because we can't trade HP for damage at anywhere near the rate that casters can.<br />
<br />
Take a wizard (at one extreme) and a warrior at the other and compare and contrast their abilities, then tell me as a person RUNNING a game (GM if you were) you would look at the 2 and call them balanced.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Deadalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Kailyn, you're making it sound as if a caster could always kill a 1k hitter alone, anywhere, and could trade hp for damage way better than a warrior under any circumstances.<br />
<br />
It's like saying &quot;artillery is so much better than infantry at dealing damage to the enemy than infantry is, it's so unfair! and they almost never take any either!&quot; and then the unit gets to fight in the mountains or jungle and people like you are nowhere to be found with their complaints...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">You are taking analogy too far....<br />
<br />
And there is no place where melee can shine like casters can. And, give it a while more, adn you will see tankless LDoN groups. I was in with 3 necros, a druid and mage...at one point the druid was dropped (before we adjusted tactics) and frankly the killing rate changed not at all, even with me backing out of combat and allowing the pets to tank. Heck, near as I can tell they were taking less damage than I was. <br />
<br />
In many ways I felt like was back in the EQ old days--and pre-every nerf necro. The overall balance between magic and melee, or offense and defense is so out of balance, that were I running EQ as a GM I would fold the game. <br />
<br />
I think we all have been lulled into passivity by the level of the imbalance, and when we see stuff like Absor's quote, it takes effort to see out of the box enough to realize how whacky things are. Why should damage that has the HUGE advantage of range, do significantly more than damage that has 0 range?<br />
<br />
As fundimental questions: What do casters give up for their massive damage? What do melees gain for their damage? What was the basis for the balance, and how has that balance changed over the course of 5 years?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Preach it Kailyn! ^_^<br />
<br />
I disagree that Caster power isn't a Warrior issue.  I see Caster Tatics vs Melee Tatics being way out of wack where Warrior problems are just a symptom of it.  Its also one of the reasons why Knights are not where Warriors are.<br />
<br />
Many of complain about how Knight mitigation is too good compared to Warrior mitigation.  How bout a kiter who can multiple monster and only lightly get hurt?  Can any of us kill 4 monsters and only take a couple of thousand points of damage?  That is real power.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you have ever pulled a mob that had a bow you would know that they fire an arrow and then run after you until the dly refreshes and then they fire another arrow at you, no 10+ seconds of casting time to wait for in order to get a mob back to camp.<br />
<br />
In short mobs can run and shoot at the same time just like PCs can.</div></div><hr />

Play with the rangers in EC some time...I KNOW they used to be able to shoot at you as they chased you, was quite scary in fact when I was in the 20s (this was about 3 years ago though) and I agro'd them by mistake as I ran through.</div></div><hr />

I hate that pulling is an intrical part of the game.  I think it is one of the things that hurts the game more then anything.  When I think back to the days of AD&amp;D, the most fun I had was when the shit hit the fan.  There was no &quot;pulling&quot; - if you got attacked, and other enemies were nearby, the fight was on.  Kiting - forget about it, casters and ranged attack's would have stopped that cold.<br />
<br />
Then again, in AD&amp;D, you typically play a hero and most mobs were easy to kill in singles (ok dragons were always a bitch).  I really hate computer the EQ AI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Pumilio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">do you really want to be doing events where unsloowed unegaged mobs are immediatly range attacking the first thing they see?  or the puller? etc.</div></div><hr />
