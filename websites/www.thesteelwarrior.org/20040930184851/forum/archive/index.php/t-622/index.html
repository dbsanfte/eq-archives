<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vamcoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I agree about some of the other boards:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i don't visit the other boards but it must be frustrating when they try and complain about us and aggo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Here is a wild ass guess.  I would guess that other classes complain about Warrior lack of aggro control because, uhm, it really is lacking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kalaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ask the wizards, they'll tell you that the problem with Warrior aggro is that we're all unskilled newbs.  All we need to do is learn how to play our class correctly.  And, hey, they're Wizards and have all that Int and stuff so they must know what they're talking about, right?<br />

While I don't hate it, the majority have some HUGE misunderstandings about just about everything melee.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I frequent a number of class message boards, and honestly most of them have a lot of people who just dont understand other class's, including paladins and warriors =p, and generally spout off the same crap that was argueably true two exspantions ago when someone brings up a balance issue, and generally look at it only their PoV....<br />
<br />
For an example.. Melee rebalance<br />
<br />
Druid/Wizards: &quot;Melee Rebalance&quot; OMG THOSE MELEE ATTACK ALL THE TIME WTF THIS WILL MAKE IT SO WE NEVER GET GROUPS AND THOSE MELEE THAT ALWAYS GET GROUPS WIL LGET EM EVEN MORE...<br />
<br />
Warriors: Melee rebalance: Lot of good discussion on the topic and a lot of good points, but always somehow ends up with how paladins are overpowered and a sometimes a few too much &quot;Woe is me&quot;  complex, still one of the class's that needs the most look at for rebalancing and has more points then most class's.<br />
<br />
Paladins: Lot of good discussion, but a few too much we are &quot;Paladins must excel at everything we do&quot; complex.<br />
<br />
People equate weakness to something that needs to be fixxed, when sometimes its intended or Needed overall.</div></div><hr />
