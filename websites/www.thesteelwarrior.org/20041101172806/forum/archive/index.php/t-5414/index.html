<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sakryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Magelo link is at the right and haven't seen a whole lot of upgrades out there for me, just thought I would ask here to see what others thought. Working on getting a bloodmetal earring of engagement to replace my solstice earring other than that I have no idea what I need to upgrade to help me out.<br />
Thanks in advance for all your help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aurthur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, I see tons of potential upgrades...but it really depends on your bankroll and what your guild can assist you with.  Just about every piece of gear you currently wear on your main slots, with the exception of your gloves probably, could be upgraded with Royal Attendant Armor of the Sands.  The increase from those pieces alone unaugmented would be staggering.  Augment them...and suddenly you're a new warrior.  <br />
<br />
However, if LDoN isn't something you can do to generate the amount of points needed for that route, or you're more of an 'instant gratification' type...  if your guild is moderately powerful, you could probably complete the 10th Ringwar to upgrade your 9th ring.  You could also take down Vindi or Statue for a BP of Vindication/Eradication, with a possibility for Boots of the Vindicator to upgrade your boots.  If you guys can take down King Tormax, then you could score the helmet of the kromzek kings, boots of the storm, ect.   If you can get a group of your friends to stand the boredom in CT, it'd be good xp/loot for you to camp the planks.  This camp can drop the heavy rubicite belt (very nice for warriors), mosquito leg earring (upgrade for you) and the Boots of Flowing Slime (this is the hook for your casters to come, FT3 boots).<br />
<br />
If you're a bazaar man with PP to spend, you could easily upgrade to an cheap or expensive elemental bow, either featherwood or stonewood depending on your aob/resistance preference.  You also could upgrade the earrings to either mosquito, lizard bone or bloodmetal.   Ornate pants/sleeves/helm would also be a significant upgrade for you (or the bp, for that matter...but not quite as much, and it's much easier to just kill Vindi and grab that one).  Shoulders could go the route of Barbed Rubicite, Heavy Spiked Shoulderplates, or you could try the Strength of the Elements quest...if you dare.  ;)  <br />
<br />
You're going to want to investigate Haste options...sooner probably better than later.  There are several dozen good options for your average raider, with 3-4 dropping in NToV, 1 off Yelinak and one quested from KT (from Yelinak's head...and my personal preference) but they depend on your guilds' firepower and regular targets.  For the meantime, you may want to get your friends to gun for Talendor and Kolek'odar (or however you spell it, the dragon in CS) to get a 36% haste item to tide you over until 41%.<br />
<br />
Last suggestion, assuming that your Magelo is correct, would be a few more utility weapons.  Get yourself a slowing weapon, my personal preference is the Truncheon of Doom.  I'd also suggest a journeymans walking stick for tashing.  With those items plus your snare whip, you'll be ready for most 'no X class, need to fill in some effect' situations.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sakryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks for the reply, have been gunning for the truncheon for a bit now but no real luck as of yet. As I prefer to earn rather than buy my upgrades, ( well almost all the time ) I will look into some of those things you said, guild is a family guild on CoV faction so Yelinak is out of the question, but we have a fair number of friends, so maybe time to start looking into a little more raid content. <br />
Again thanks for any help anyone can give me</div></div><hr />
