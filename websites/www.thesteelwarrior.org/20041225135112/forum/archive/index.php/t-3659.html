<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 06:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok this has been driving me crazy.  When I execute a flurry the message appears in YELLOW colored text in the chat box.  I have a lot of other types of things in YELLOW so I want to change the flurry text to some other color that will make it stand out more, but I can't seem to do it.  <br />
<br />
I have gone into the Colors part of the UI and changed just about every YELLOW colored message to a different color, but Flurry is still YELLOW.  Does anyone know what color number changes the flurry message I just cant' seem to find the right one.</div></div><hr />

I always see the yellow flurry text go by and sometimes think it was the yellow exp message.  :P  Maybe I should drink less.</div></div><hr />

<br />
click on the chat window and hit &quot;make new window&quot;....take a break you are halfway there!<br />
<br />
now right click on it and go down to filters. go to melee and choose NPC enrage/flurry/whatever and it will appear in that window!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">10-15-2003, 12:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Note that they are talking about PC Flurry, as in our aa, not NPC Flurry.  Last I heard, there is no way to change the color, no clue about moving it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draganetti</div><div class="date">10-15-2003, 12:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">LoL, I liked the take a break part.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">10-15-2003, 12:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I tried.  To the best of my knowledge, it is not included in any filter any not included in any chat color.  It kinda sucks because my main window isn't my melee window.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rylaa</div><div class="date">10-15-2003, 01:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just got flurry a while ago and was wondering this myself. Wish I could change it to another colour and window as well. And *rant on* damnit I want to be able to shut off slay undead crits! Okay done ranting!:p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draganetti</div><div class="date">10-15-2003, 05:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmmm. . .perhaps one could make their &quot;main&quot; window their combat window, and move everything else to a new window and make it like their, uh, primary chat window, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">10-15-2003, 02:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Damn well that sucks that you can't move or change its color<br />
<br />
Another thing I want is for other people to SEE when I flurry.  Why should I get spammed 100x per mob when mage burnout pets flurry yet no one gets spammed by me flurrying!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vigdis SangCaru</div><div class="date">10-15-2003, 03:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hm. I have five chat windows.  <br />
<br />
One is for actual chating (so tells, /gu, group, auction, etc). One is strictly combat (my hits, bad guy hits).  One is strictly spells. One is &quot;too far away&quot; and &quot;cannot see target&quot; messages, which is minimized to nothing b/c I just dont care to see the spam and can tell by my hit chat when I am and am not hitting. <br />
<br />
And one is &quot;everything else&quot; (so enrage messages, flurry messages, rampage messages, &quot;emotes&quot;, NPC text, /who, etc).  My own flurry messages show up in the &quot;everything else&quot; box.<br />
<br />
So you can move the message.  You just can't move it to its own private chat - you are stuck with the &quot;everthing else&quot; type chat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dugman</div><div class="date">10-15-2003, 04:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Your own flurry messages fall under the &quot;other messages&quot; category in the filters and color scheme.  This is the same category used when you gain experience, for instance.<br />
<br />
So to move flurry to a new window, you need to set the window for the &quot;other&quot; messages.  This will put flurry messages, experience gained messages, and all the other misc yellow messages in that window.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.</div></div><hr />
