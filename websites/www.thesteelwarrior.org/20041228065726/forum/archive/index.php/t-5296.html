<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drunder50</div><div class="date">01-20-2004, 07:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Was just wondering if there are going to be new Items with an endurance stat on them and also will the gear we currently wear that has STA on it be replaced by the equal amount of END?  It seems to me if they replaced STA with END then they should replace it with the equal amount of endurance or did we just get screwed? <br />
<br />
Just curious )</div></div><hr />

<br />
Stamina will not be replaced as it is the key factor in calculating hit points. The only thing with stamina that they have changed is the regeneration line of spells. They no longer have an effect on the stamina bar since it was replaced with endurance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Endurance replaced the stamina BAR, not the stamina STAT.  They will not be doing anything to the STAT called Stamina.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So the Endurance we currently have is it? We cannot expect any endurance on any gear we currently wear? <br />
Right now when i use my Mightystrke Disc it takes like 70% of my endurance.  I thought I read somewhere that items will be updated with an endurance stat or was I just dreaming ?<br />
<br />
I apoligize for the seemingly newb questions but I am just trying to understand all this. <br />
<br />
Thanks again for the great info =)</div></div><hr />

Don't be surprised if you see + endurance items in the future. ATM though, yes, all you can do is build your prime stats (str/sta/dex/agi) for a bit more endurance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
one of the devs said that they were working on adding +end to gear now and that it would be as common as +mana on gear.<br />
<br />
so i would think old world gear would get it as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">01-20-2004, 08:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, and I'm sure it will be itemized correctly too.<br />

/auc Flowing Black Robe Ac 8, +3 int +5 sta +10 ENDURANCE!</div></div><hr />

That would remove quite a bunch of items they wouldn't need to touch. After that go over the item list and put +mana on gear that was for pure melee in first place (or just melee gear) and let the same stat be there for 2 different applications. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jakle Attakle</div><div class="date">01-20-2004, 12:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Faed, that is definitely breaking the NDA. The only way someone could confirm 100% what you said was by being in Beta.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fenring</div><div class="date">01-20-2004, 12:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would hope old world gear gets +END, I don;t want to have to upgrade half my gear just to keep up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">01-20-2004, 04:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm betting most gear that a level 50+ would wear (since that's when we get most of our disciplines) will get +END. I'm also betting that +END will be in small chunks, not like +75 to +150 mana we see on caster items, we'll probably see +30 END, etc. We really don't have enough disciplines to use constantly to neccessitate that much endurance.<br />
<br />
I use defensive and I still have over half my endurance remaining when it wears off. When I use Incite I recove the endurance during the fight and am back at full for the next one, etc. Only time I've ever run out of endurance is when I used Furious, then defensive right when that ended, then constantly using Incite to keep agro (defensive ending up not lasting the whole 3min).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">01-20-2004, 04:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">at 305 on all melee stats (with SoV and Focus) I have to work real hard to run out of endurance.  On boss mob fights I can get away with starting with Fort/Furious, then using Def/Evasive/Stonewall, and finishing with fellstrike.  Depending on how many Incites I use I have had the last disc not quite go the full distance.<br />
<br />
The regen rate on it seems real nice too.  In longer fights I have noticed that if I take it easy on incites I regen more than enough endurance between evasive discs to use it whenever it comes back up.<br />
<br />
Having more endurance added to my existing gear, especially if its as prolific as mana on hybrid / caster gear (imagine +135 endurance on each bit of Raex) I just cant see ever running out.<br />
<br />
In my opinion the change to disc's is the best thing to ever happen to warriors making us a really fun class to play now.</div></div><hr />
