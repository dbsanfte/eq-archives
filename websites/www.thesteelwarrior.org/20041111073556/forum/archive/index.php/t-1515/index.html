<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dumptimax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Saw this thread for a guilds recruitment on my server board here:<br />

Some of what he said does make sense, but was also a bit silly, thought i'd see what peoepl around here thought?<br />
<br />
afaik, i myself have never known of a guilds MT that was an ogre /shrug<br />
<br />
I will be MT in my guild and am iksar, I feel confident i will do fine when the time comes, but to each their own i guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">until my friend zzixx left my old guild our MT was a lizard, troll, or myself ( half elf in my previous life ).<br />
<br />
i think by the time they had a full time MT that was an ogre ( he played 24/7/365 and his brother ( ub3r_shammy ) PL'ed the living hell out of him ) they were just about through with ToVN.<br />
<br />
i guess having an ogga MT makes things easiest with the non stunnability idea plus they'd be the first char's that could max stats before getting to the really uber type gear.<br />

/shrug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ogres are the worst warrior race.  Trolls are 2nd worst.  This should be intuitively obvious to the most casual observer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
But, I would change to a RZ halfling or something, rather then a dwarf again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Raychael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You would change to an azzling! Personally I'm a barbarian lover. Retiring Raychael and starting a Barb Warrior for fun gonna name her Sectlorum NovusOrdo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Go with what you like the look of.  Im at the point now where my stats are capping with raid buffs and its made me really happy to be a half elf.  Sure when I was level 55 in cobalt and a treeweave I used to drool over ogre stamina and almost rerolled at one point, but if I was an ogre I'd now have no stat advantage, an XP penalty and like every ogre and troll in my guild my nick name would be fat ass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i would make a barb; the whole RP enviroment is perfect for them.<br />
<br />
pretty much that was why i chose a wood elf; nice RP options.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">ahh everyone &lt;3 the azzlings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I agree with Brutul, ogres are the worst race.  That guild probably won't last too long, as it's leadership has a few screws loose.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">ogres are a bad race.....I personally like the iksar because of the innate regen, the ac bonus, and just that I look pimp. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Binnamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The only reason why I would go assling, or something (read gnome)... is that I can't really play large races for a while (think the highest I ever got one was 16 hehe), and because dwarves can't warship RZ- which would (and still will) have made my warrior's career so much easier.<br />
<br />
/shrug Gnomes would be fun too :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>aakla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">*braids Dobbo's feet hair and ties pretty pink ribbons to the ends of them* <br />

joo da pretty now :) /beems with pride</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Katina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I think it's kinda silly... monitoring every hour of your play.. a little too loot oriented for me</div></div><hr />

When I join my guild way back before Kunark, our tank line up consisted of nothing but ogres and trolls, with one half-elf and me.  I think if you're concentrated at all in the end-game eventually, race doesn't matter.  I do have to say that I think halfling is an excellent race to start with, on par with advantages that ogres/trolls/iksar have, that scales all the way to 65 - levels up fast, good faction most everywhere initially, small size to fit everywhere, and sneak/hide are extremely handy to have...I never have to worry about finding a merchant I can sell to, and it's nice to have for exploring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Tugurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Say what you want about all the other stuff. The bottom line is that chicks dig fatties. Hence ogres, with all that raw sexual charisma, are the master race. QED</div></div><hr />
