bored of my wizzy now hehe - have 100k to spend on a warrior twink, but i have NO idea what to buy, i was looking at dual wielding a Swiftblade of Zek / Horn of Hsarga, but that seems odd hehe - you guys are the real experts...<br />
<br />

<br />
Make sure to choose Rallos Zek or The Tribunal as your diety for the Fierce Heraldric or Helanic Tundra armor you'll get at 46.<br />
<br />
To start, some simple Crustacean Shell armor with as much hp stuff as you can find (6ac 65hp rings, 65hp/mana neck, 35hp/25 mana ears, spider fur belt/collar, shimmering terror hide cloak, etc (search for warrior armor by hp and buy the best deals, but do keep in mind the stats, hp is not king by itself). For weapons, start with something like Blackened Acrlyia Blade (14/22) and Steel-Laced Aged Snake Whip (12/18) neither is that expensive and both have great ratios and no recommended levels.<br />
<br />
That stuff will last you until 46, although you won't be able to help upgrading here and there along the way. At 46, get Fierce Heraldric/Helanic Tundra everything, Valorium Rings, Bloodmetal Ears, Soulscream Belt, Cloak of Greater Pernicity, Bonespur Mantle, etc etc etc)<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Aye, Id get a Fungi and a Haste item right off the bat.  Get a pair of low delay weapons and a good two hander ratio for lvls 20-40 ish.  My warr had crusty gear with a fungi and I flew thru the lower levels.<br />
<br />
Once you get serious with the toon (arond 45+) then fully equip them with fierce heraldic, some better weapons, and possibly better haste.  Once you start to group then you wont really need the fungi anymore.  And keep your weapon skills at good lvls, you never know what type of weapon you will get later on.</div></div><hr />
