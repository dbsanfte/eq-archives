<br />
I picked agnostic long long time ago.. back before crit hits were put in, back before fear was created. <br />
<br />
Basicly all the benifits that came from being agnostic are nil and void today. With the creation of pok and easy porting and quests that really dont give a flying hoot who you worship.. where is the upside?<br />
<br />
Nevermind the fact that none of this gear with god restrictions on it existed back then and there were only downsides to picking a god =P</div></div><hr />

<br />
ps: It's called a TRADEOFF.  That's easy coming from someone with gear like yours.<br />
<br />
Btw, the gear I have is better than the diety specific armor. I can't benefit from any of the crafted armor but what has happened is wrong and should be fixed. No one is saying you have to agree with it but alot of people do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Partha</div><div class="date">02-17-2004, 12:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bullshit what has happened is wrong.<br />
<br />
 What has happened is the game has changed.<br />
<br />
 Time was those of us who picked a diety were the ones being screwed for a long long time - the next few expansions, they may very well bring diety based factions back to the fore and screw us again. What ya gonna do then?<br />
<br />
 If I had a dollar for every whiny POS who picked Agnostic back in the day because they wanted to get into cities with less faction farming who started moaning the moment the first piece of Fierce Heraldric rolled out for sale, I'd be a goddamn millionaire. Offended? I could give a care.<br />
<br />
 It's a choice you made at startup. If you screw up, you can always restart, or you can live with it and work it out. Maybe spend the time it took to create that petition and go, I dunno, go get decent armor?<br />
<br />
 EDIT - Yeah, Gerick, I guess it is my time of the month. Armor progression? Don't make me fucking laugh. People either use Heraldric to twink out their level 10's in a full set or they do like me and get one piece or two. And if you get 65, tell me with a straight face you won't dump it for either Ornate or drop equivalents.<br />
<br />
 Agnostic armor progression = generic Heraldric. So sorry if it's not up to RZ or Tribunal quality - the AC is the fucking same.</div></div><hr />

It's not the message, it's how you say it.  &quot;fucking retarded&quot; is what's out of line.  You should be able to tell him this thread is old news without resorting to name calling.  If you can't express yourself without flaming, stick to the outhouse.</div></div><hr />

If it is not a big deal then why should it be that there is such a difference between the diety armor? Not a big deal can always find other gear, but just seems wrong. It's kind of like the itemization issue between knights and warriors that people ask to be fixed but this just puts the same kind of gap between people with different Gods. Probably not going to be at the top of the list but it should be there none the less.</div></div><hr />

Big deal, so you lose some hitpoints...thats really not gonna make or break you. Its only a matter of time before you upgrade.<br />
<br />
That crap aside, its more how you play your char in the lower levels than whether you have a slightly better item here or there. What do people want, all races/deities to start with the exact same progression options? What then, more whining about how bland and sucky EQ is.<br />
<br />
I dunno, I chose agnostic long ago when I didn't want a band of guards on my ass every time I strutted through town. I got what I wanted and took the consequences.</div></div><hr />

The subject of cultural armor is older than dirt, let it die, please.<br />
<br />
I'm a Tunare worshipping wood elf, I wasn't terribly impressed with full mithril armor.  Did I cry about it? Did I reroll? No.  I shrugged it off and spent my time on something more constructive, finding *alternatives*.  Guess what? I get groups, I tank just fine and I'm enjoying myself!  I advise others to do the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dintorr</div><div class="date">02-17-2004, 03:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I chose Agnostic because:<br />
<br />
1) my Warrior was my very first character<br />
2) I had not a damn clue what I was doing<br />
3) the helpful &quot;guide&quot; I found on the internet said to go Agnostic<br />
<br />
Now, 2 years later I realize 2 things about that guide:<br />
<br />
1) I should have put all my points into STA and not STR<br />
2) I should have chosen RZtW as a deity<br />
<br />
I can work on increasing my STA through gear and buffs, but what can I do about my deity?<br />
<br />
Not a damn thing, and that's a shame.  Why?<br />
<br />
Because &quot;agnostic&quot; means that you are skeptical about the existance of God(s) but prefer to not profess true atheism.<br />
<br />
So, one day you venture forth to PoG, PoD, CoD, HoH, PoTactics, etc., and what do you know ... you find yourself nose-to-nose with a real, true, in-game &quot;god&quot; ...<br />
<br />
After *that* experience, how in the hell can you still claim to be Agnostic?<br />
<br />
Agnostic makes no damn sense whatsoever, *especially* from an RP perspective.<br />
<br />
At the very least there should be a quest to convert from agnostic to a chosen deity.<br />
<br />
And there is simply no way in hell i'm re-rolling just to get the chance to wear deity specific armor.</div></div><hr />

Do you honestly think I got this gear magically? Do you also honeslty think I always had it like this?<br />
<br />
When cultural armor part 2 came out, the RZ and trib was looking very damn sweet to me, but I couldn't use it. I didn't complain. I ground it out and worked at getting what I could use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bustinn Amove</div><div class="date">02-17-2004, 03:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would like to make some final comments about this thread.<br />
<br />
1.) I had no idea this was discussed before<br />
2.) This was simply a request for input and support on the eq boards in hopes the developers would consider the ability to change diety.<br />
3.) I was merely using the cultural armor as an example of why I feel the system is flawed. I myself, would not benefit from any cultural armor.<br />
4.) To those that supported the cause, I thank you. To those that merely left responses for either attention or to simply act better than everyone else, well, good luck to you.<br />
5.) My attempt at this thread was not to benefit myself but to hopefully shed some light on the new players coming to the game that are not aware of diety and how it can effect your gameplay. The choice of diety I feel should be required upon creation of character but that's my opinion.<br />
6.) Most of you calling me a whiner, complainer or what-not, don't act like your shit don't stink because I've seen plenty of you bitch about the warrior class for multiple reasons. We all want the game to improve....some for personal reasons, some not. <br />

<br />
maybe if i was a shammy or a SK than iksar armor would be half decent when it came out and useful to my then lvl 45ish toon, but 20 lvls and probably over a year later i like to think that my gear as well as my options for upgrades has grown. the only set of diety armor that could even last past 60 for a warrior is the rallos armor. changing your diety mid way just sounds like a sad excuse to take the easy way out instead of working for your gear.</div></div><hr />

If you are going to quote me, atleast make a response that is pertaining to the FULL quote and not the first sentence. Quite honestly, I could care less about your gear and fact be known, half the people are ebay'd so who really cares.<br />

<br />
2.) This was simply a request for input and support on the eq boards in hopes the developers would consider the ability to change diety. <br />
<br />
 Done, and apparantly rejected.<br />
<br />
 3.) I was merely using the cultural armor as an example of why I feel the system is flawed. I myself, would not benefit from any cultural armor. <br />
<br />
 Cultural armor is the ONLY example people have to make anymore. They are certainly not worried about being able to walk into Neriak or Grobb anymore. No, it's only to rock out on the l33t twink armor that people want to switch diety. Well, the generic stuff has the exact same armor class and decent stats as well. So what you miss out on a few hundred HP? At the early levels it won't mean a thing and and the late levels you're repping this gear with better.<br />
<br />
 5.) My attempt at this thread was not to benefit myself but to hopefully shed some light on the new players coming to the game that are not aware of diety and how it can effect your gameplay. The choice of diety I feel should be required upon creation of character but that's my opinion. <br />
<br />
 The number of people coming into EQ now uneducated are vanishingly few. Most people who enter now come with assistance from friends/relatives/spouses/coworkers. It's not like the days of Kunark when I first hit create with an extra 5 points in INT.<br />
<br />
 6.) Most of you calling me a whiner, complainer or what-not, don't act like your shit don't stink because I've seen plenty of you bitch about the warrior class for multiple reasons. We all want the game to improve....some for personal reasons, some not.  <br />

 This complaint does not make the GAME better. It may make your agnostic self better, but it does NOT improve the game as a whole. Changes like Incite made the GAME better; diety switching does not.</div></div><hr />

Changes like Incite made the GAME better; diety switching does not  Like I said, this doesn't benefit me in any way, nor will it in the immediate future. Perhaps all your complaints are for your own self riteousness but not everyone elses is. And Incite made the game better now that you have to acquire items with +END to be able to constantly use Incite and multiple Discs with no working spell from another class to help rejuv endurance, hense longer down time and a even bigger time sink. Yea, that made the game better. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

You have some here and started this thread on how unfair cultural armor is to agnostics. You have stated that it does not benefit you as your gear is already superior. You have also supposed that my opinion doesn't mean anything due to my own gear. Okay. So we both have gear better than cultural yet your opinion is worth more than mine? No. It does not work that way. I also ask of you to point out where I was 'talking shit'. If you mean by strongly disagreeing with you, I will again have to disagree with your statement. I have not attacked you personally nor reduced myself to vulgar language.<br />
<br />
As to quoting your entire (short) post instead of the one relavent line, that's hardly a gross atrocity. You seriously need to lay off the defensive.<br />

<br />
The diety armor wasn't a bad balance decision...it was a fucking awesome balance decision in a sea of shitty balance decisions.<br />
<br />
Just because it's the ONLY reason to choose a diety now doesn't make it bad.  It just makes faction and all of the other benefits of choosing a religion that have dwindled over the years look like the crap they are.<br />
<br />
If there were more things in the game like diety armor, it wouldn't be an issue.  Since there's not, people are somehow convinced that it was a shitty design move.  They're wrong.<br />
<br />
And to be perfectly honest, I've heard it all in 4 years.  My halfling suxors.  My Innoruuk DE suxors because everyone is KOS.  My agnostic toon can go anywhere.  Nothing on that character select screen even matters anymore, we're all just skins on the same stick figure.  That's kinda lame, and any attempt to keep it that way isn't gonna go over well.  I'm sorry you picked a (insert race and/or diety here).  PL another toon in the 3 days it takes to get him to 65 and quit whining.  If the grass is greener, then jump the fence.</div></div><hr />

You are aware that you can still wear cultral armour and be agnostic and have similiar gear (your original post on eq boards says you can't)?<br />
<br />
For example..<br />
<br />
ELF HIE HEF FRG <br />
<br />
Can wear Full Mithril Armour instead of Blessed Full Mithril<br />
<br />
HEF DWF HFL GNM FRG <br />
<br />
Can wear Brellium instead of Underfoot or Mischievous<br />
<br />
HUM BAR HEF FRG <br />
<br />
Can wear Fine Heraldic instead of Dragonkin/Fetid/Fierce/Hateful/Luminant/Radiant/Salubrious/etc etc<br />
<br />
To summarize only one set has the high HP's on it that being Fierce.  There are alot of players who decided upon a god but not Rallos.  So even those Warriors are in the same boat as agnostics, except we have the option of wearing gear that has plus wisdom and intelligence on it.  Yay us.<br />
<br />
I hope they do include more armour weopons in the game that is diety specific, just don't give all the good stuff to the Rallos clubheads.<br />
<br />
Btw I play a Halfling Warrior 65 follower of Brell.  And I am cool with what I get.</div></div><hr />

It's quite obvious they gave the bonuses to the races that lend themselves to being a better warrior, and then extended that to people who worshipped the god of war.<br />
<br />
I'm completely unable to see why people can't see why it's set up the way it is.  I'm sorry that your candyass religion you picked for whatever reason doesn't give you any benefits, but don't bitch about something that was designed to make warriors look and be different.  As it stands at the high end, everyone has 305 stats, everyone wears the same shit, the only difference is race.<br />
<br />
Just because it doesn't benefit you doesn't mean it's not a good idea to add a little variety to things.  I'm all for making more diety specific stuff to add some spice to the game, but wanting to remove the only distinction between characters right now is just baffling.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My last line states I am cool with what I get as it is, so I am a bit confused if your disagreeing with me.  And exactly where your going, being a Rallos supporter I assume you have no idea as well...<br />
<br />
But, just to be serious for a second I do agree with your overall point, its a good one.  And the point at the end of my post is basically what you said.  I don't want to see the developers give all the good stuff to the Rallos followers, and just cut and paste the rest of us.  Not because its unfair, but because its damn lazy on their part.<br />
<br />
They started down the road with this cultral armour, keep at it, give small races a bonus on stuff that seems most natural to them, same with the elf types.</div></div><hr />

Better than a dumbass I reckon.  You don't benefit from it?  You aren't hurt by it?  Spend your time worrying about other things, and concern yourself less with the plight of the 4 people who can't get ahold of some ornate.<br />

<br />
From a true role-players ( damn them rp'ers :D ) point of view...the Vah Shir can't have a choice of God to praise; because they don't believe in gods.<br />
They're animistic; follow shamanistic ways; and to them all the things animate or inanimate have a spirit and that is where they gaint heir powers. That is where the Vah Shir bards come into pla; and why the cat race can be bard. Their history and teachings are handed down through songs and dances ( go to shadeweavers thicket sometime and just talk to the NPC's ) and to somehow in the future allow Vah Shir to worship one sole god would go against everything they believe in and taught from the day they were born and nurtured.<br />
<br />
Sure; I delved deep into the role playing of that class; but overall the whole design of gods in general should be looked at as such.<br />
Sure; you can call an apple an orange; but it's still an apple.<br />
<br />
Deity armors; sure they seem a bit more biased than others ( being a karana worshipping half elf i know ); but in the end the only thing that bothers me about it is that; well; nothing.<br />
<br />
I personally think SoE did a good job at designing the deity gear; IF you worship Rallos Zek sure you're going to be blessed with attributes edeavored by the God Of War. If you worhsip Innoruuk; you're going to gaint he sly cunning and intelligence of the God of Darkness. If yo worship Mithaniel Marr you're going to b blessed with the wisdom of the pious.<br />
<br />
But to gripe about it in the form of &quot;look at their armour; why does mine suck&quot; isn't the way to handle it. Overall looking at each statistic the armour posesses and compare it to similar items you make out pretty damn good.<br />
<br />
The whole deity armor gripes are just pissing in the wind IMHO. Be happy they deit does make a difference now tha what it was 4 years ago when deity meant if you were KOS or not in some town.</div></div><hr />

What I'm starting to see is it's all about advantages vs disadvantages.....that being said, what is the advantage of being a Vah'shir that must chose Agnostic? Do they get any advantages that some other races don't? Also Ogre's don't get stunned, that IMO is a huge advantage versus other Warrior races. Should there be a disadvantage for them?</div></div><hr />

Our biggest issue for some time was the aggro problem. Beyond a shadow of a doubt, we can't complain about that any more.<br />

I really think discussion of deity is a topic with little value. Yep, RZ has more hp...whoopee, it only affects you for a short time. You disagree? Level to 65 and you'll quickly see how meaningless cultural armor is. I'm not being elitest, just stating that you really won't worry about it for very long. Focus on understanding what it takes to be a good MT and no one will care that the doof beside you has more HP.<br />

Why did you pick agnostic to begin with? Why was it ok when you started but it isn't now? Why, if gear doesn't matter, did &quot;being RZ&quot; become cool? Did you suddenly become a supporter of bringing roleplaying back to EQ, restoring it to its gaming roots?<br />

<br />
Hmm...ok Dobbo, don't take this as a flame...but share with me how it took 'skill'. The only 'skill' involved in XP groups per se was for slowers to hold a little longer before casting. The alternative, which also isn't skill, was to have a solid hate producing weapon.<br />
<br />
Yea, you could time yer taunts a little better but seriously, if chanter/shammy slowed too quick there was no skill to possibly peel the mob off without some dmg done. AE taunt? Yep, but not available for every mob.<br />
<br />
Hey, if you wished they had never added incite thats your prerogative.<br />

<br />
Pre-PoP I wasnt in a hardcore raid guild, but I was in a guild that raided.  Still hitting velious, starting to work on the easy stuff in Ssra - rhags n stuff.  I had worked fucking hard for the gear I was wearing which was mostly skyshrine quested plate - 40ac, 40hp legs.<br />
<br />
Those legs are the same as your non diety specific legs in the stats that matter, sure they have a bit more str/agl/dex but no one cares about that.<br />
<br />
Upgrades to SS legs at that point? for an agnostic warrior there was a set of legs in NToV - ancient wyvern hide or something, Ivory Crystal greaves off the high priest which there was no way my guild could kill at the time, and 2 pairs of legs in VT, umbral and fiery might.<br />
<br />
So yeah, I was kinda shitty that one choice I made as a newb 2 years earlier meant that I had to raid Halls of Testing for fucking weeks to get the best legs available to me while some other dude who ticked RZ at the same time could go to the bazaar and buy legs with twice the hps (4th best legs in the game at this stage) for 8k plat.<br />
<br />
On top of this you had a generation of bazaar babys coming up who had been PL'd to 60 and spent 80k in the bazaar (the going rate at the time for a full set of FH on tribunal) and they had superior gear to what I had raided my arse off for.  There were server transfers who showed up on the server naked and a guild smith would hand them a set of FH and they would be ahead of me in HPs the day they arrived on the server.  All because I didnt choose RZ.<br />
<br />
Oh but they had it so hard, they were KoS to Dwarves in Butcherblock.  Maybe a small problem if you're a woodelf 4 fucking years ago, but now theres nexus spires, then pok books, new continents where diety faction means nothing and port bitch druids who will take your arse anywhere for 10 plat.<br />
<br />
But that was during SoL.  Now there are more options and ornate drops in a camp where anyone lvl62+ can XP.  Sure it costs a little more than FH, but it is an realistic option for non RZ/tribunal worshipers who arent in guilds raiding the uber stuff.<br />
<br />
I standby my opinion that when FH camp out it was a big fuck you to anyone who didnt RZ and wasnt raiding the end game, but the mudflation of PoP and LDoN has made it irrelevant now, so its a bit late to be taking on this crusade.</div></div><hr />

 I rolled as a Human Warrior, dumb enough to put 5 points in INT because I wanted to Tailor. (This was close to the release of Velious.) When the person who introduced me to the game heard I'd picked RZ, I got ribbed pretty mercilessly because I was 'too dumb' to pick Agnostic.<br />

 Along comes the first set of deity armor. I got both bracers. I still wore one until I hit 50, they were just that damn good.<br />
<br />
 Then comes Heraldric. All of a sudden, every single fucking twink Warrior made is an Ogre RZ worshipper. Every single fucking twink Bard is a HE RZ worshipper. And of course, the casters who were twinking them out were doing full RZ armor, bought with the plat they earned selling gear to schmucks like me.<br />
<br />
 I FINALLY in the last month splurged for a whole two pieces of FH. Take a good look at my Magelo, Gerick. 65 with 34 AA's. Every single fucking non-jewelry piece of armor you see with the exception of both bracers and the boots are drops that I've personally looted in this game. This was done with a guild whose idea of a big raid prior to 2004 was a shawl crawl.<br />
<br />
 Good armor is easy to fucking get without having to camp the bazaar. And maybe if people quit whining about the diety armor, got up off their asses, and went and got it, they'd have a lot more fun and see a lot more of EQ than they do currently.</div></div><hr />

Like the poster above me said, its getting easier and easier to bypass it now with mudflation. Its taken me a good while (sadly with a large amount of pp sitting in my bank that does not even get used as I refuse to spend 100kpp+ for one item unless it makes me much, MUCH more effective), and I would still use the legs lol if I could. Paying 120kpp for no drop ornate greaves when I could buy a full set of FH for that just does not sound appealing to me.<br />
<br />
I wish they would cripple the required ratio though. Nothing else has been more of a twink lure than FH armor since it came out to the warrior class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">02-18-2004, 07:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Those of us who chose a deity for roleplay reasons paid for it for years.  Go back to the days of having to walk or take a boat damn near everywhere you went and try playing an ogre RZ worshiping warrior in the qeynos area, or on faydwer, or for that matter near freeport.  It sucked.  You had to have a keeper to buy food/water/bandages etc., and you couldnt sell anything yourself.  At least until you had killed a few billion gnolls or orcs.  People generally chose agnostic because....it was EASIER.  Now that has changed, so there's no real penalty for faction anymore (at least if your careful).  If there weren't so many alternatives to cultural armor that are just as good if not better, I might say you had a relevant argument.  But at this stage of the game, just go get what you need and be done with it.  Hell, the ldon armors are as good as or better than ornate, and all they cost is time. And while your banking your points you're getting to xp and get decent cash at the same time.</div></div><hr />

For my race, dark elf I cannot find one starting  difference faction wise between RZ and Agnostic where Agnostic greatly benefits. I have checked and all I can find is RZ has a better starting faction with Kael. If I missed one, please enlighten me.<br />
<br />
The only discrepency I have been told about  is that if you apparently did quests back in the day (which ones I have no idea) with good aligned factions that required more than indifferent, agnostic could faction higher as RZ was apparently capped at indiff with certain factions.<br />
<br />
RZ has never been a harsh faction, rather stick with the &quot;I roleplay with the God of War as my leader I should be entitled to more as a warrior!&quot; bit. But then again that would bring up the questing instead of buying it in bazaar argument.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'll agree with you that 99% of the people who own it are fuckin twinks, but you can't penalize the rest of us that worked our asses off for it.  I made every piece I own.  Hell, for a long time, if you saw Fierce on CT, there was a good chance I made it.<br />
<br />
But, that's the price you pay for having tradeskilled shit.  It's either tradable or it's useless, it can't be both.  And yes, faction is irrelevant these days, but it wasn't for a long time.  For years everyone knew that the only thing that had any benefit was agnostic.  Then there were a couple years where being RZ or Tribunal had a benefit.  Now it's smoothed out with the availabilty of Ornate.  My faction doesn't mean shit in shadowhaven or plane of tranquility and your religion doesn't hamper your ability to obtain gear.  Sounds like it's fine to me now.<br />

Everyone forgets Guk  For the longest time, if you didn't have positive guk faction, you weren't likely to make it to lower guk, which was one of the best XP spots in the game.  All good races and all good religions started out glower to the frogloks, but all evils and ALL RZ were KOS.  The 2 just happened to overlap in a DE.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And irony Haas  is that the first people &quot;to quest&quot; it on my server were not even close to being warriors heh. But thats more to do with just how silly this game can be sometimes more than a warrior issue.<br />
<br />
I am almost to the point where I am completely above all FH now so it does not mean much anymore to me. I buckled down and worked damn hard to get upgrades. Finally after 15 months of wearing a hot bracer and a Bob I now have two nice bracers thanks to questing my cords and buying a bracer of sand. I have upgraded my shoulders, both bracers, a mask and boots to above FH in that time.<br />
<br />
My nostrils flare though when people lie out their ass about it, or use any argument they can hope to find,  and I just gotta have my say heh. But I agree with you, it is much better now.<br />
<br />
edit:- and my point about that Haas was race was far more of an issue than diety ever was. Does that mean Ogres and Trolls should get better armor?<br />
<br />
second edit:- Actually lol now that I think about it  a few shadowknights could bring up the fact that Trolls and Ogres actually do get better cultural armor compared to their smaller race counterparts, but I will let Sk.org deal with that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yep, that was a long goddamned time ago, but if that's not important, than neither is Fierce now that you can get Ornate or LDoN plate or whatever else competes with it nowadays.  Sure, people are always gonna downplay what they have, but anyone will tell you that for 2 or 3 solid years, the only thing people told anyone when they're making their character was &quot;Just go agnostic, it's easier.&quot;  Well, like I said..my stats are maxed.

Especially because I think the line of defense of how hard you had it is silly. <br />
<br />
Anyways I will test it out and get back to you as far as Barbarian warriors go. But I can tell you that its wrong for people to just generalise about agnostic and FH worshipers as far as what they are entitled to. One because race can affect it to the point where there is no difference, and two because there are more dieties than just RZ.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Like I said before, this isn't a bad thing.  Diversity is good.  The problem is a lack of other things like this.   If there was an ac 50 200hp neck handed out to Karana worshipping warriors in return for 4 muffins in some remote part of King Xorbb's Gorge, I can say for certain that I would not be fucking crying about it, but maybe that's just me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
And while I would think it was still stupid, you are correct I would probably not even post about it because it benefitted me (although I doubt I would defend it).  Funny how the human mind works I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khazzuz</div><div class="date">02-18-2004, 09:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The whole 'I had it so hard then I deserve an advantage now' argument sounds suspiciously like something I heard from knights in the recent past.  :)<br />
<br />
As an agnostic dwarf I often wondered how much improved my character could have been at certain levels if I had had the option of using FH.  Instead I would have had to spend twice as much or even more for a comparable upgrade, or go out and pick it up myself, which is what I've done mostly.  <br />
<br />
Diety armor is certainly not the end all be all of equipment after you reach a certain stage of the game.  Out of curiosity I went to magelo and made a lvl 65 RZ ogre with the same AAs I have and gave him all FH armor, the same non FH slots I have, and kept any slots which I currently have that I considered to be superior.  The difference ended up being ~100hp, in my favor not the RZ ogre's, and about 35ac in the RZ ogre's favor.  For reference you can look at my magelo, I'm not in a heavy raiding guild and currently wear no pieces of ornate.  <br />
<br />
So at level 65 now with a lot of time and effort I'm now able to basically equal what someone who followed RZ and bought his equipment in the bazaar did.  Personally I'm now past caring about the cultural armor, but I can guarantee you ten levels ago when I didn't have the ability to camp a lot of the items I wear now that the extra 600hp and 100ac I would have gotten from FH would have been damn nice.</div></div><hr />

Apparently it was too different, and I am missing out on some pretty good Tunare-only HE caster armor that would give me some really good intelligence and mana bonuses. And you know what? I really don't care, because it just means that I have to patch with generic caster armor that may occasionally have 2 less intelligence or cost 100pp more. You don't have to whine about armor because the problem doesnt' really exist, and thinking it would be &quot;cool&quot; now to worship a god? That was a choice you made, and a choice you live with.

Everquest as a game changes and evolves as well as the knowledge of each class and how to best roll, equip and play it.<br />
<br />
Back when I started playing as a complete newb in 1999 I rolled my Human Warrior and because at the time people were saying Warriors needed STR more than anything I listened and tossed all of my points into STR. Granted that was one of the great misconceptions I had ever lent my ear to. By the time I realized that STR was not nearly as important as STA I had a choice to make. Roll again and start over or play the hand I dealt myself. I played the hand and I do not regret it. To say that some of the cultural armor is better than items available to those who chose agnostic back in the day when it was an advantage is true. I guess you have a few choices here. <br />
<br />
1.) Re roll your RZ worshipping Warrior<br />
<br />
2.) Play the hand you dealt yourself. If you let someone else roll up your toon your a numbnut btw. It is not your toon anyway just on loan IMO.<br />
<br />
3.) Work really hard become the next Bill Gates and buy SOE and make all the Agnostic people happy.<br />
<br />
My only problem is that people do not have the ability to make a decision and go with it. Pick one of the above options and move on. Life is not fair and neither is EQ. Suck it up your a damned warrior for Zek's sake.</div></div><hr />

Verant publicly stated that deity will not effect game mechanics or game storyline in any way.

 You are correct that I am not ancient. I came in a few months before Kunark, so I'm not exactly a recent player either.  I do also remember seeing complaints that deity did not do enough. That was not long before the first round of deity restricted items (that I recall) from the PoG quests.<br />

This is a 'you' issue, even if it's over your pride rather than your gear. That's what I've been seeing throughout.<br />

Aside: Vah Shir aren't truly agnostic, the deity system just doesn't have an 'I worship the spirit of everything over the gods' option. Agnostic is just unable to commit to the existance or non-existance of the gods. Which IS rather silly once you meet them, really!

Well, I tested a Barbarian warrior worshipping Rallos Zek. Results are very similar to my DE RZ/Agnostic comparison test.<br />
<br />
<br />
Barbarian Warrior worshiping Rallos Zek can Bank/Buy/Sell  in:-<br />
<br />
Qeynos<br />
Freeport<br />
East Commons/West Commons<br />
Kaladim (guards dubious vendors apprehensive)<br />
Ak'Anon<br />
Kelethin<br />
Felwilthe<br />
Erudin<br />
Rivervale<br />
HighKeep<br />
Firiona Vie<br />
<br />
The only differences that meant anything that I found were that RZ Barbarian warriors were threatening to Upper Guk Frogs, agnostics were dubious. On the other hand RZ Barbarian warriors were dubious to Kael, agnostics were threatening.<br />
<br />
Now that I think about it I knew most of this already, as my evil barbarian warrior I made years ago on Sullon Zek went through the same thing.<br />
<br />
I don't want anything changed at this point, I feel its at a much better place than it was.  I just want people to be more honest about it like the poster said above. It was not fair, but EQ is not often fair so suck it up and deal with it, because no one is really going to give a crap about your woes when they hold an advantage over you in a videogame. <br />
<br />
Even though I bring up arguments now I did deal it it myself. The first time I brought this up I got told to sftu and reroll (ironically some very familiar faces blew up when knights told us warriors that very same thing :)), but  that is a stupid argument considering how many days I put into my warrior. Overall I feel that other dieties have very good options these days to match/surpase FH armor. Its takes more work, but its worth it. <br />
<br />
<br />
On a sidenote, its kind of strange when the most fun you have had in the past year in this game is running around old zones seeing all the old sites again. Was sad just how few people I met along my travels that frequent these zones anymore (save HighKeep which is pwrlvl paradise). The original designers of Everquest really did create something special.</div></div><hr />

I just don't understand why I'm being ripped in shreds for stating my opinion. I've been nothing but polite here until I've started being called names and treated like trash. I unlike others defend myself and have enough self-respect to do so.  <br />
<br />
i have to agree, this is all about RZ warriors wanting the keep the edge, but FFS, we are all warriors here, its not like we are pallys!<br />
<br />
anyhow the system is crap anyhow, whats wrong with a little monkeying with it if it doesnt nerf anyone without them knowing it</div></div><hr />

I've been trying to hold myself from telling you off this entire thread. The principle of the matter be damned. If you want a new deity so bad, reroll. Also, what were you told before. Nothing. Verant made no claims when you started the game on what deities would and would not net you. Players had to discover on their own what factions and religeons did. So, what IS your fight.  <br />
<br />
what like we were told to reroll paladins? this is backwords, something that is bullshit needs to be wiped up, picked up, and thrown away.<br />

In early Luclin when it was some of the best gear around there was some reason to gripe about it.  People did gripe about it a ton, nothing happened.  Now it's not even high end.  In fact there is even better smithed armor in the game now, hell the AGNOSTIC armor is better than the diety stuff in some cases.  But thanks to the fact that some newbie just made it to level 50 and realized there was armor in the bazaar that he couldn't wear, we have to go through this whole discussion again.  (I don't care if he claims to have 6 accounts and been playing since 1992 if he is just picking this week to gripe about armor that has been in the game for 2 years he is a newbie).<br />

I do think the difference between RZ/Trib armour and other cultural armour was excessive at the time, but not something worth getting your panties in a bunch over, certainly not to this extent especially when you arent doing it for yourself, but you are doing it for the other poor agnostic warriors who dont have a voice...<br />
<br />
Well I pulled up Bustin's magelo anyway, something I didnt do earlier cos the link isnt entered correctly or something, and found something interesting - Bustin's still wearing a chunk of that velious gear, the stuff that people used to raid for but now no one bothers with cos you can go to the the bazaar and kit your RZ worshipping twink out in much phatter FH gear.<br />
<br />
Looks to me like you'd get a decent upgrade on your Boots, Greaves, one Bracer, Helm and Neck.  About 150hps worth and a small but not insignificant amount of AC.  <br />
<br />
Fair enough, I'd camp an 8 page thread of me against the world and all that stuff if I thought I'd get a 150hp upgrade out of it too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is one key difference as I pointed out in my post. You CHOSE to be agnostic. You are bitching and complaining like a little woman because no one agrees with you. Why don't you go roll a Bard ya little cry baby. I showed an example that I thought was fitting, about rolling based on the advice of people playing the game when I started and a CHOICE I made. No one here is griefing you for the concept of what you want it is how you behave when someone rationally disagrees with you. I am ashamed to have people like you playing this class. There is a time and a place to complain about something. Class balance is a hell of a lot different than your chosen deity. I mean lets be honest here this armor is for Twinks anyway. If you can say with a straight face that you know a guild's MA that is decked out in FH or other armor I would wager they are still raiding Crushbone. I honestly don't care what armor twinks wear and I don't care that you want to sob and whine like a little baby because we disagree with you. Move on there is nothing for you here.</div></div><hr />

He didn't whine, most of you guys did.  Only thing I saw was a bunch of posters tripping over themselves racing to insult him and his posts.<br />

He offered a thread then reasonably discussed it, he even listened and respected peoples replys that were opposite to his own.  I didn't see any mods come in and tell him to calm down, it was the trolls that got the warnings in this thread.<br />

<br />
 And my original point, even stripped of it's anger, still stands.<br />
<br />
 There is NO reason to have a diety change quest in game for any reason whatsoever outside of being able to wear diety specific armor and use diety specific weapons. None. Zero. Zip. Zilch. The Big Goose Egg.<br />
<br />
 It also doesn't help that this exact same topic rolls around on a regular basis for the exact same reason. When you look at Mr. Bustinn's gear, his claims that he'd get no benefit from being able to suddenly wear RZ or Tribunal armor ring hollow. He pretty blatantly wants to max his gear with no effort on his part by changing the entirety of the game without being burdened by concepts like personal accountability in rolling up his character.<br />
<br />
 Oh, wait, that's right. It's not HIS character. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

 Fine Heraldric has the exact same AC as Fierce. The ONLY real difference is in HP - 425 raw HP between the two. Forgive me for not getting excited over a number only slightly lower than the difference between unbuffed Paladins and Warriors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">02-21-2004, 08:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">HP is important because it all adds up, the 2 togeather puts you at ALMOST 1k above a similer paladin, and that 425 Hp can be powered up with the AA that grants 10% more off the base, that makes it matter even more, and you should look into it, you also have more STR, what makes FH even more wrong in the scale of things is that it is mostly ogres using it, who already have more hp than the average warrior, and who are stun immune without using an AA(was that aa scapped?)<br />

 In the second, at where even we are in the level/gear continuum, and what we're tanking, 425 HP is nothing. And if you want to talk about having the HP changing AA, then you should be like me and mostly out of the FH by the time you're working AA.</div></div><hr />

Nooo....<br />
<br />
He was whining.  Whining because he can't get a BOT group to replace a few shitty pieces with ornate and instead wanted to go to the bazaar to grab some FH and tried to pass it off as being a savior for the &quot;little guys.&quot;  There is no one in the game who is REALLY wearing superior gear to Fierce that even gives a fuck about it.  The only people that care are the people who are wearing worse and don't want to look at other alternatives so they just sit there and complain about how their friends told them to pick agnostic 4 years ago because that was the &quot;cool&quot; thing to do and now they got fucked.<br />
<br />
You know what, i've got no sympathy for ANYONE who didn't pick the god of war on creation.  You're a warrior for crying out loud, it should be painfully obvious what you believe.  The weak shall fall at the hands of the strong.  Or I guess in the case of all you Tunare or Karana crying pansies &quot;The weak shall go and plant pretty flowers all over norrath.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
thurg, bazaar, skyshrine,bazaar(heraldic), vex thal, ornate. elemental, new GoD stuff<br />
<br />
<br />
skyshrine to vex thal is a big fucking jump, fine heraldic is nice in theory but no one makes it, no one sells it, and most smiths are AFK in the bazaar NOT taking special orders.<br />
<br />
the thing is you can go to bot, get groups, do BoT raids, but its chance, and if you hang out in BoT with crappy gear for more than a week, you start to build a rep as a mana sponge and people wont invite you, i havent been branded as a sponge yet thankfully, and i can get groups in BoT, but alot of people dont have that sort of luck, this is what i ment by cutting off a horses back legs, there has to be a decent ladder if you want to get gear thru raiding, ornate is gotten by luck.<br />
<br />
all im saying is there should be a decent path for anyone willing to take it, there isnt alot of fairness going in the direction on augnostics in that we were PROMISED by the devs that it wouldnt effect us like we did, and on the discription it would lead you to think you could commit at a later date, if you dont support the line of thinking that promisses should be kept, then they can get away with no melee balance part 2, they can get away with ignoring what they put in the manual.<br />
<br />
i can remember we qouted the game book like the bible, posted logs and data on how we got screwed wrongfully, now because you are not concerned with it you dont care, and it shouldnt even be posted in public view, EXCUSE ME, but were you not the same person ostrasizes the asshats that were time level saying everything is peachy keen, and they had no right to tell us to stop bitching? well dont be a hipocritical bitch k?</div></div><hr />

went back and checked for sure, you really minimalize how good FH can be compaired to fine, first, you get STA, DEX, STR and AGI thrown around as well as more HP, all the fine stuff doesnt have much besides hp and mana, so basically, FH has more procs, more str, more ability to dodge ETC, there is a big fucking over going on there</div></div><hr />

 I do minimize it, you know why?<br />
<br />
 Because if you're a Warrior, 999 times out of 1000 you are with someone who will stat buff you. Once you get more STA than it takes to max out with a STA buff, what comes after is essentially worthless as long as you're buffed. As far as DEX, STR, or especially AGI, I'll let more experienced Warriors tell you about their value on gear.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Northerner</div><div class="date">02-22-2004, 04:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">once you get more STA than it takes to max out with a STA buff, what comes after is essentially worthless as long as you're buffed. <br />
<br />
True indeed but you must admit that a buffslot is a pretty valuable thing to waste.  Even as a Rogue I look forward to the day I can hit my stamina cap unbuffed and not have to consume a slot for Boar.  My tankish alts would be even more interested given the desire for BoV/DI/Spellshield/Rune/DSes and such in various encounters.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying I agree that there is a massive difference due to religion but I do agree that there is one, and perhaps it is unfair in some ways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">02-22-2004, 05:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">you bring up a good point about buff slots, anyhow partha im not saying we can ONLY tank in FH, im saying we tank like ass when compaired to ogres who follow RZ, just like we used to gain aggro like ass compaired to paladins, its the compison that really makes us look shitty, casters get used to warriors in mostly heraldic or better getting fairly close or over the cap (pre AA cap) but let me tell you, i can be under the cap with buffs, and i try to farm at LEAST 6k a day for the last few weeks and im still playing catch up with these fucking twinks<br />
<br />
the main thing is, people talk and you can get a rep of being a waste of healing power because you dont hit the cap with buffs for STA, you take more hits because your AGI isnt up there, you get less proc because of medocre dex, while fatass_01 can move FASTER, more procise and quicker than i can<br />
<br />
my point is if you want to say there needs to be a balance what is the point of giving RZ ogres all the cards? stun immune, with cult. and FH they can get closest to the cap (i can understand them maxing STA as ogres, but i dont care how fucking magical that armor is, it isnt gona make that ogre more mobil than a human, or a gnome or anything, where is the penalty really? ohh right large in game size and laughable eating habits..... hmm shrink and a few AAs to slow down the eating, now lets see what are my choices to offset the imbalance? REROLL, just like i could have made a fucking paladin if i were such a quiter)<br />
<br />
i mean come on, the FH must be a fucking powersuit from fallout tactics to be able to make thunderbuns loudass dance around on his tip toes</div></div><hr />

<br />
Gerick, brace yourself.  This is going to come as a shock to you, but I feel that you need to understand it so that you can move on.<br />
<br />
You tank like ass because you have shit for gear.  No other reason.<br />
<br />
Accept it.  You'll be a much better man for it.  There is gear out there better than heraldic.  You just don't care to look at it.<br />
<br />
Edit : <br />
<br />
I should clarify this so it's not taken the wrong way.  I'm not putting you down or anything like that.  I'm saying that compared to people who you perceive as tanking better than you, your gear sucks.  That's why you tank worse.  Trust me, if you're standing next to an ogre in Heraldic, there's already 2 reasons he's got on you 1) like 300more hp from natural stamina that you don't cap, and 2) Heraldic is superior to a lot of your gear.   Spend some time in BoT, win some boots, win some bracers, find a couple other upgrades and you'll see that difference diminish and then fade away all together.  It's not the end of the world, you just can't go to the bazaar and pick up your gear, you actually have to go camp it.  That's no big deal, you get XP for it anyway and you can use the AA's you get to further boost your survivability.  It's a win/win situation, but you keep treating it like a loser.</div></div><hr />

Yes when I stopped playing Isk could've benefitted from worshipping RZ/Trib. But, that's cos I sat on my ass and didn't camp stuff like ornate. I wasn't rich, either, mostly cos I didn't save money for myself. I was kinda miffed about it but moved on. You should too.</div></div><hr />

There are some FH pieces that are better than Ornate.

Look, if you don't like the fact you can't wear FH armor, re-roll and get it. Or raid. Or buy ornate.  How many Paladins told you that when you were complaining about us Warriors being gimps compared to them? They said reroll or get over it. Did you do either? I doubt it. As far as raiding for it, let's just say I can't remember the last time I got an AA. You all act like you just go on a raid and get it....it may sound easy but its not. The BP is the easiest part to get which I got with my Guild. The legs, I'm sure you are familiar with this camp. You can't just go &quot;raid&quot; it and expect to get it and win the roll much less get him to drop it. And another thing, not everyone plays this game 14 hours a day. I am enjoying EQ alot now, I love my guild and we are doing alot. Yes it's gonna take time to upgrade my gear but I am upgrading my gear rapidly considering what I had when I returned to the game. That still doesn't make the imbalance valid....it's just an easy way out. Did all the Warriors who were upset that Paladins were better tanks than them and could hold agro better them just reroll and dealt with it? No, they didn't and now we have Incite and some Discipline changes although the Endurance is a bit off IMO, but fact is you spoke, you were heard and something was done about it. You had your right to do that. Am I not entitled to mine? Sounds like alot of you are just hypocrits.</div></div><hr />

Are you the game designer of EQ? My point about imbalance is an Agnostic would have to get to BoT to get equivalent or slightly less equivalent armor as a RZ would have available at level 1. If that is not imbalance, then you have the most polished rose colored glasses known to man. I have every right to voice my opinion here as anyone else. The difference is when you all were voicing your opinions on how gimp Warriors were to Paladins, I didn't once come to you and tell you to stfu, move on, quit the game, get a life, get better gear, reroll, the list goes on and on. There have been a number of people that have disagreed with me and respectfully voiced their opinions and I accepted that here and on the EQ forums but there is a little clique of you who think you are better than everyone because you are RZ and everyone else should bow down and kiss your ass and agree with you or continue to be called names. This isn't elementary school, grow up, act like an adult, voice your opinion respectfully....if not, then don't expect others to treat you with respect.</div></div><hr />

<br />
[list=1]<br />
  If I choose to go Agnostic the game will be somewhat easier.<br />
  I want to be Agnostic because I dont want to follow any gods.<br />
  Wtf I just want to play NOW, I don't want to bother.<br />
[/list=1]<br />
<br />
For point 1, that easier portion was the trade off for not being able to wear any cultural diety armor.  For point 2 thats just a choice, point 3 that was just lack of choice by the user.<br />
<br />
*  Yes Vah Shir dont get a choice.  And if you didnt create your character thats just too bad.  A game system should cater to peoples choices not other peoples choices that are inherited.<br />
<br />
To now introduce a quest into the game that allows someone to go from Agnostic to Worshipper should involve changes to the game that have a far greater impact so as to justify such a quest. <br />

What I mean is, to make it such that the benefits across all races for being a Worshipper is of such value that it is indeed unfair to just Agnostics that didnt have this in the game at time of creation.  And should be given the option of changing over (maybe).<br />
<br />
As such for this quest to be introduced I want to see the following in the game.  And note I am only concerning myself with Warriors here, and these are JUST MY INTERPETIONS but I think they serve as good examples.<br />
<br />
When you create a character, most races have bonuses or deductions made to their stats, including resists (which I am not including).  I would like to see this included in a more meaningful way across all races.  Plus to make some of these Statistics worthwhile I believe the impact they have on Warriors should be addressed, and this is my interpretation (some of this is already in the game)  and do note I am being a bit vague I dont want to design a brand new combat system in this post.<br />
<br />
Two factors should apply to Cultural/diety armor (Race and God) and only one to Non-diety armors (Race).  Therefore;<br />
<br />
My interpretation of Stats.<br />
<br />
Stats<br />
<br />
Strength. The higher the Strength the more damage per hit.<br />
Stamina.  The more you have the greater hit points you get.<br />
Dexterity.  You hit the mob more often.<br />
Agility.  Higher Agility equals higher Armour Class.<br />
Intelligence.  The higher your intelligence the higher your weopon skill caps raise.<br />
Wisdom.  The higher your wisdom the less damage you take.<br />
Charisma. The greater your Charisma then positive spells last longer (or are better i.e heals) and negative spells have lesser duration and or effect.<br />
<br />
My interpretation of Races.<br />
<br />
Races<br />
Barbarian - Stamina and Strength.<br />
Dark Elf  Agility and Intelligence <br />
Dwarf  Stamina and Agility. <br />
Gnome Intelligence and Dexterity.<br />
Half Elf Charisma and Agility<br />
Halfling  Agility and Wisdom<br />
Human  Strength and Charisma<br />
Iksar  Wisdom and Agility. <br />
Ogre  Strength and Stamina<br />
Troll  Strength and Intelligence<br />
Wood Elf Agility and Dexterity.<br />
Vah Shir  Agility and Strength.<br />
<br />
My interpretation of some of the Gods<br />
Gods<br />
<br />
Rallos Zek  Grants greater Hit Points, and extra to racial abilities<br />
The Tribunal Grants greater Armour Class, and extra to racial abilities<br />
<br />
<br />
Examples with the above reflected in the armor;<br />
<br />
Barbarian Cultural<br />
<br />
Helanic Tundra Breastplate AC: 58 STR: +10   STA: +10   HP: +50   <br />
Class: WAR Race: BAR<br />
Deity: The Tribunal<br />
<br />
Helanic Blood Breastplate AC: 51 STR: +10   STA: +10   HP: +80   <br />
Class: WAR Race: BAR<br />
Deity: Rallos Zek<br />
<br />
Ice Tundra Breastplate AC: 51 STR: +5   STA: +5   HP: +50   <br />
Class: WAR BRD Race: BAR<br />
Deity: None<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If that can be introduced then I would be more inclined to have a quest in to change from agnostic.  Otherwise I don't see any real point, its such a small thing.<br />
<br />
And it is such a small thing, in another month I will have addressed the HP difference gained from Rallos gear as opposed to my Brell gear.  Total time I will have spent in Non-Rallos armour will be around 4 months, thats not a huge amount of time imo.</div></div><hr />

Psst. There's a recommended level on it.  You're right, its 45. Like alot of you said, you can get lvl 45 in a couple days so your arguement holds no water. Regardless for a lvl 45+ Warrior, the FH is still by far the best and easiest to acquire.</div></div><hr />

 But you see when alot of us clicked Agnostic, it had a description in it that said, &quot;but will have the ability to chose a deity at a later time if so desired&quot; And 4 months is nothing to a power gamer but someone who plays leisurely it might be.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Allow me to quote you.<br />
<br />
 Most of you calling me a whiner, complainer or what-not, don't act like your shit don't stink because I've seen plenty of you bitch about the warrior class for multiple reasons. <br />
<br />
It was merely a request for Agnostics who agreed with my point of view to be heard.....kinda similar to the idea to boycot warriors by sitting in PoT doing nothing.  <br />
<br />
I guess that same advice can be awarded to those complaining about the imbalance in warriors and their taunt/tanking abilities. <br />
<br />
I'd be willing to bet money that you were one of the ones complaining about warrior agro.....just play the damn game. <br />
<br />
<br />
About this &quot;get over it bit&quot; isn't that what all the Paladins were saying when you couldn't tank and couldn't keep agro? <br />
<br />
<br />
How many Paladins told you that when you were complaining about us Warriors being gimps compared to them? They said reroll or get over it. Did you do either? I doubt it. <br />
<br />
Did all the Warriors who were upset that Paladins were better tanks than them and could hold agro better them just reroll and dealt with it? No, they didn't and now we have Incite and some Discipline changes although the Endurance is a bit off IMO, but fact is you spoke, you were heard and something was done about it. You had your right to do that. Am I not entitled to mine?  <br />
<br />
<br />
Okay so I think I covered that question. Now another one for ya.<br />
<br />
<br />
but there is a little clique of you who think you are better than everyone because you are RZ and everyone else should bow down and kiss your ass and agree with you or continue to be called names. <br />
<br />
I have never once stated I am better than anyone. Honestly all I have said is that you had the choice when you rolled the toon and I don't think you should be able to choose to change your deity. I chose STR over STA again a choice I made and I am not allowed a one time exemption to change my choices. You flame everyone like they are Haas and Partha. Give me a friggin break here. I disagree with you now and I will disagree with you tomorrow and even next month. We all have made bad choices at one point or another in EQ and never once has Verant or SOE given me a mulligan. What makes you so sure you deserve one?</div></div><hr />

<br />
[list=1]<br />
  If I choose to go Agnostic the game will be somewhat easier.<br />
  I want to be Agnostic because I dont want to follow any gods.<br />
  Wtf I just want to play NOW, I don't want to bother.<br />
[/list=1]<br />
<br />
For point 1, that easier portion was the trade off for not being able to wear any cultural diety armor.  For point 2 thats just a choice, point 3 that was just lack of choice by the user.<br />
<br />
*  Yes Vah Shir dont get a choice.  And if you didnt create your character thats just too bad.  A game system should cater to peoples choices not other peoples choices that are inherited.<br />
<br />

<br />
your wrong in a way, if you allow god changes a gnome still wouldnt be in a suit of large size armor, and a human would squeek into a gnome suit, then only major change to the armor itself would be to make it size alined, such as add vahshir to the larger armor, as a vahshir i think i have a valid bitch that we dont have cult gear, we dont have any god armor, we dont get much more than gimp soulscream armor and ANY race/class/god can make that so it isnt cult, anyone can do the quest</div></div><hr />

 I applaud this sentiment. I even said basically as much on page 1. I don't flame just to flame, I flame when someone asks for the entire game to change not to make it better for everyone, but just to improve their own sorry state caused by their own choices. Why not just ask for God mode and /testbuff 65 with Time loots?</div></div><hr />

Honestly no I don't. I just don't get the big outrage here. As I see it you have a few choices here.<br />
<br />
1.) Bang on SOE until they give you what you want. Estimated time to satisfaction 12-18 months.<br />
<br />
2.) Re-roll a toon to your satisfaction and use all the cultural armor on it. Estimated time to satisfaction 3 months assuming you play casually.<br />
<br />
3.) Live with and move on to farm better gear for yourself using guild resources or pick up raids in BoT. Estimated time to satisfaction 1 month.<br />
<br />
There are a lot of things you can do to alter your situation and banging on Sony is probably the most time consuming and unproductive of the options. Just get to work on upgrading yourself and stop acting like a martyr. Yes it may not be fair but if you have not learned that life is not fair by now you will soon. There are advantages and disadvantages to every decision you make. I suggest just working to improve your own situation and feeling better in the fact that you know better and learned from the decision you made. <br />
<br />
/shrug <br />
<br />
I guess we all can't make every choice right 100% of the time so make the best out of the situation you have and move on.</div></div><hr />

I guess we all can't make every choice right 100% of the time so make the best out of the situation you have and move on.  When I started this campaign I knew from the beginning that 1 of 2 things would happen. Either they will allow the Agnostics a change LIKE PROMISED, or they will just shrug it off and move on to other things. I also knew that IF something was done, it would be atleast 6 months and only IF I had enough support from other players, mainly Agnostics who were also promised a deity change but never got one. That being said, I knew by the time everything was said and done, this would be no personal benefit to me. (Hence the reason why I said I wouldn't benefit from the change) My Guild takes very good care of their members and we are getting ready to kill the Emp and move into VT where it is very easy to upgrade an entire Guild quite rapidly. But all this was about principle. Promises being made and not kept. Just like the person stating that Warriors would be the masters of weapons. I had forgotten that....but its promises like these that are not upheld that really burn me up. In high school and college, I witnessed alot of similar instances where we as students were promised various things that never were delivered. The only way I felt I could do something was run for Class President which I did. One of the biggest gripes students had was not getting what was promised and/or deserved. This campaign is very similar. That's why I felt an urge to do something about it. Just like the person that was fed up with being imbalanced with Warriors versus Paladins and started a campaign that eventually got heard. Why? Because someone took the iniative to stand up and do something and with enough support and backing, the Warriors were heard and something was done. This campaign may not be as big as that but the principle is the same. People gripe and moan about much lesser things but that is their god given right. I have that right to voice opinions that I feel are unfair or unjust, but I'm not an idiot, moron or bastard because of it. Alot of people disagree and that is their right but all I asked was do it in a respectful, mature manor. Yea I'm probably just wasting my breath, but deep down, I know I stood up for what I believed in and didn't chose the easy way out by quitting. As per responses on the EQ forums, there are many out there that do feel they were wronged and I feel better knowing that we atleast made an attempt to have a change implemented. Lesser things have been fixed so what was the loss in starting all this? A couple board trolls calling me names and trying to verbally harass and humiliate me. Big deal, I've been called worse.</div></div><hr />

You missed my point about weaponmastery. The game has drastically changed. Relying on what you may have read at character select is fallicious and wasteful. <br />

Where was this promised? I'm too lazy to look for it in the thread!  You know when you are selecting a deity, it gives a short explaination of each? Well it was changed recently...it used to say that Agnostics chose not to believe in a god or didn't know which god they felt was best suited for them.

So I guess I would change my advice to you then. Go ahead and try to get this changed although I doubt anyone will vote you president of Norrath. I tend to disagree with the sentiment behind this because to be honest you said in the beginning that you were supposed to be able to change deities when you created the character, but you did not create the toon your brother did. I guess I can not feel like YOU were promised anything and thus it really weakens your point as the spokesperson for this change. I do not believe that you personally were misled I think it was easier for you to pick up the toon someone else created rather than levelling one yourself. Now you see a flaw in that toon and want it changed. I would advise in your crusade that you not mention on any SOE boards that you and your brother have been playing on the same account or you can wave it all bye bye.<br />
<br />
As for you wanting to have a civil conversation about the topic I would like to believe that is the case but the fact that you have not replied to those who disagree with you in a civil manner you can only expect to reap what you sow. <br />
<br />
Bottom line is go ahead and do what you want but you are in a poor position to be the person to rally the troops because there are just too many holes in your agenda. I would hate to think of what you are going to do once Social Security is gone and you had been promised a pay out on it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for you wanting to have a civil conversation about the topic I would like to believe that is the case but the fact that you have not replied to those who disagree with you in a civil manner you can only expect to reap what you sow. <br />
<br />
Bottom line is go ahead and do what you want but you are in a poor position to be the person to rally the troops because there are just too many holes in your agenda. I would hate to think of what you are going to do once Social Security is gone and you had been promised a pay out on it.  Well your assumption that I merely picked up this character so I wouldn't have to level it is incorrect. My brother had access to my account and made a Ogre Warrior, Agnostic. Got it to lvl 3 and stopped playing it. I could have easily restarted and gotten to lvl 3 in a matter of minutes but I liked the name, class and race so I just kept playing him. There are other characters that are effected by Agnostic deities such as enchanters which I have as well. I am not wanting to be the President of Norrath or whatever, I was merely stating my feelings towards in hopes of demonstrating my personality. Normally I would perceive a comment like that a snide remark but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt. I have received numerous pm's in support. As it looks now, it just seems like a huge pissing contest. No one has to believe me or my intentions on this. I could really care less. Mainly what I learned from this thread is what a bunch of miserable human beings there are on this forum that obviously are so insecure with themselves they have to measure how l33t they are based on their character.<br />
<br />
I'm done with this thread because I've said all that I wanted to say and it's just turning into one big pissing contest. To those that have supported me via EQ boards and pm's, thank you and good luck to you. To those that brought legitimate arguements based on facts and strong opinions, I respect and I thank you for your feed back. <br />
