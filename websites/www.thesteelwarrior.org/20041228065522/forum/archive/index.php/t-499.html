<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">proteg</div><div class="date">05-06-2003, 01:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmm, I'm wondering if I should try and sell my Green Scale and get a Greatstaff of Thunder.  <br />
<br />
I Currently DW a Frosty Mainhand and offhand a Fleshy.  In groups with non-morons I hold aggro fine, but when I get groups with idiots it is a very serious issue.  Most often when I get a rep they ask me to get a Pally so they can have someone who can hold aggro (ouch).  <br />
<br />
I would leave the idiot groups but if I did that I would never get exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sloanbone</div><div class="date">05-06-2003, 02:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Get your epics... you wont regret it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ThornyEQ</div><div class="date">05-06-2003, 02:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">LOL, if you were on The Nameless, I'd trade you my Greatstaff of Thunder for that green scale in a hot second and thank you up and down profusely from now till next year. Not because, the Greatstaff isn't worth it (it is as nice weapon), but because I can get like 10 Greatstaves of Thunder for the price of one freakin' green scale.<br />
<br />
My suggestion to you: keep the green scale and get your epics. Light sabers may not be the greatest weapons, but they are serviceable, and they still make the ultimate warrior fashion statement, even three expansions and one extension later. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Friedrick</div><div class="date">05-06-2003, 03:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It depends on a couple of things.  If you obtained the green scale on a guild raid and went up against other warriors who needed I would say the ONLY honorable thing to do would be give the scale back to the guild.  In this way another warrior working on his epic and that wants it will get it.<br />
<br />
Personally, if I were in your shoes I wouldn't worry about obtaining your epic unless you are very close.  Warrior epic is a pain in the ass to get for most people not in an uber guild that can 1 group the mobs.  I recently obtained my epic (finally finished it at lvl 63) and &quot;upgraded&quot; from a Frostbringer that was on loan from a friend.  I haven't noticed any significant aggro increase with Blade of Strategy offhand vs. Frostbringer.  IMO your dual wield setup is as good as your epics for DPS and aggro.<br />
<br />
The warrior epic is a fine weapon system but it is getting very dated.  I am glad I got mine, but I would have sold the scale if I hadn't already done the turn ins and was only missing the queen blade.  Most guilds could get a Cord Hilted Spike Driver off Xeno in POI for the amount of energy put into obtaining a warrior epic IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">05-06-2003, 03:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">if you bought the green scale at the bazaar or something and needed plat; sure go sell it.<br />
<br />
if you camped the hell out of sev and dragged your friends into EJ how many times or had them help you track sev ; you'd prob be shit up one side of you and down the other for wasting all your friend's time helping you acquire it in the first place; but that's just me.<br />
<br />
I'd give a green scale to a fellow warrior/guildmate who's been bustign their ass day in and day out trying to get it before i'd even consider selling it because of how much of a living pain in the ass it is to get in the first place.<br />
<br />
no matter what was in my bag of tricks; there was always a slot for my JBoW. It is a rite of passage more than anything :D<br />
<br />
/shrug; i guess whatever you play for will decide its outcome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">05-06-2003, 03:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't know how you obtianed your green scale, and obviously there are some obligations depending on how you got it - that part is for you to decide.<br />
<br />
As far as GST vs. Epic for agro and DPS, then its no contest. GST owns the warrior epic in every way. More DPS, better agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Truelove</div><div class="date">05-06-2003, 04:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wandor - this is the first time I have ever disagreed with you...<br />
<br />
But I have both epic and GSoT and epic holds far better agro imo.<br />
<br />
To the general question - dont sell the scale, epics are a badge of a real warrior who climbs the mountain because it exists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">05-06-2003, 05:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you want your epic go get it.  If you just want to improve your character, sell that sucker and don't look back.  Personally I can't believe anyone bothers to do epics anymore.  The only worthwhile ones are cleric and bard if you're in even a casual raiding guild.  Maybe rog, ranger, monk, and mage if you can get them in your low 50s to help you get to 60.  Better-than-epic weapons drop off of exp mobs these days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Auron</div><div class="date">05-06-2003, 06:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">haha so true brutal, when i started playing it was towards end ov velious and epics were just pointless.  It was far more efficient to level up and get aa then waste time getting those.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">05-06-2003, 06:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">But have you bagged your BoC and tried weilding both epic blades or the 2h epic Truelove? The epic proc can be resisted and it does nothing for agro when it doesn't land. Couple that with an insane DPS advantage and the edge goes to GST.<br />
<br />
I agree that the epic is a status symbol and it is an impressive show of dedication to complete the quest. But, it is really hard to justify the endless hours when in less than half the time it takes to complete a warrior epic I can farm enough plats to have a GST, a windblade, an SBoZ, and an HoH in my bags.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TaiilChayser</div><div class="date">05-06-2003, 06:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I say go for your epic, if for no other reason than to say you did it.<br />
<br />
Brutal I have to disagree just a bit on your statment that most epics arent worth it. Speaking from my rogues perspective I will be hard pressed to find somthing worth bagging my epic for quite some time. 40% haste and 40 raw atk are hard to replace. Even after obtaining a better main hand poker, many rogues offhand the epic for a long time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">05-06-2003, 07:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yea, perhaps rog and monk are also worth doing, only because they are easy and most people complete them in their low 50s.  Still, anybody that is in a guild that can regularly field 30+ level 60s can get a wicked shank and prismatic, which is arguably better than epic (although a good rog would probably swap primal offhand with rage).  Ranger epic is an easy-to-get haste item and the earthcaller is a handy thing to have even if you have a better weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raunstonecutter</div><div class="date">05-06-2003, 07:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd get it just for the cool looks, and it would be nice if I could DW two hate procers.  If you can get your wingblade and queen part in short order, I'd go ahead and get your epic.<br />
<br />
If not, then I wouldn't worry about it.  Give it to someone else who needs it or sell it.  But if you drug your guild out there to help you with sev...I'd personally keep it in your guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Keane Abrams</div><div class="date">05-06-2003, 09:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think it comes down to one simple question: Do you EVER want your epic? If the answer is yes, may Rallos Zek strike you down if you sell that scale. <br />
<br />
If the answer is no, sell that bad boy. And I have to wonder how difficult is was for you to get the scale. There are many a warrior who spent hundreds of hours looking for that bastard dragon.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zukobim</div><div class="date">05-07-2003, 10:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just how much do the green dragonscale actually sell for on your server??<br />
<br />
On AB there has been a GDS for sale the last 7 days now at a price of 24Kpp.<br />
The standard going price seems to be somewhere around 18-20Kpp, though.<br />
<br />
Is the AB market just screwed up or is the prices inflated on some of the other servers?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">05-07-2003, 04:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">sells for 75k on emarr.<br />
<br />
dont sell it, get your epics friend. id kill for a green scale cant even buy on as hardly ever for  sale</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">proteg</div><div class="date">05-07-2003, 06:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Couple answers to your questions (and thanks for your tremendous response)...<br />
1) I have a 52 Dru that I spent weeks tracking Sev with myself, and when I found him up finally after a fiarly recent patch I called in favors from all the people who owed me for helping them with their epics and stuff.  These people also got to roll on decent loot like any dragon kill so I don't feel overly bad about selling the damn thing.  There was 0 guild involvement mainly because at the time I was unguilded.  I admit tho, I would feel bad telling my friends that I sold it, but knowing them they're more into killing dragons anyways and were thanking me for getting them a Dragon kill.  <br />
<br />
2) Only parts left for epic are Fear (which I really dont count) and PoA.  After several weeks, no one has been jumping up to help on getting it or seems enthusiastic to help out.  I think I need to finance a PoA raid myself and just go to Island 3 or something just to get ppl used to PoA, then get a larger raid to go to Isle 5.  This is also necessary because I have gained 11 levels (64 now) since last time and I have no idea how much Power I need there honestly at this point.  <br />
<br />
3) Got a Greatstaff of Thunder today for 23.9kpp on Mith Marr.  Green Scale sells for 100k, 75k, or 55k depending on the moon.  <br />
<br />
4) I hate warriors that are into looks and ego when we are supposed to just be getting beat on.  <br />
<br />
5) Despite 4) above I really want the lighsabers for looks and ego.  <br />
<br />
6) My current Guild Leader has explicitly said the guild will not help in any way in doing PoA.  I need to do it using friends.  The guild has killed Vindi, PoI Dragon, and is going to move from HoT to WToV soon to give you an idea of our power.  Tho that seems to be moot huh.  <br />
<br />
7) Fright DTed me once....once.  I want payback.  <br />
<br />
So my outstanding question which will hijack my own thread is: How in the world do you get ppl to go to PoA and what kind of essentials are needed for classes and levels?  I am a 64 Warrior and have friends in the 62ish range, but finding Chanters is REAL REAL difficult.  Have three 62+ Bard friends tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">05-08-2003, 01:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">cant you just  buy mq of  spiroc blade? go for  about 5k</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">05-08-2003, 02:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">55 freakin k!!! Sweet baby Jesus sell that scale! You already have a GST and it sounds like you are still in for a lot of painful work unless you can get an MQ. I suppose if you really have an undying need to have light sabers then try to get an MQ. If that doesn't pan out, 55k+ can go a long way to getting you some pretty sweet upgrades.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wold</div><div class="date">05-09-2003, 02:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm PoA is a big Pain in A**, especially if your guild refuses to help. You need about three groups to do it although I'm sure people here have done it with one :). And the stupid golems in fear often don't drop the ball.<br />
On the other hand, if you have green, red, and Chardok done, you are almost there. I like the epic, tactics has a nice atk bonus/dex bonus,  and you can use the 2HS epic in PoP , it has a hate proc (Fury of Zek ) which holds aggro and you don't get riposted to death.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azlana</div><div class="date">05-09-2003, 02:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When ya call in favors from friends an such dey come ta ya aid cuz dey care about ya in one way or nudder.  Dey wan see ya happy an get a gosh dern hard piece.Aye.. PoA doesn' seem doable RIGHT NOW, buh no count it out.<br />
<br />
Now m'knows warrior who got a blade from PoA buh sold it an den got green scale.  Caused lotsa prolems fer him when folks found out blade was sold.  Why? Cuz da same folks dat help him get green scale had already helped im get da PoA blade.... lotsa feelings were hurt.<br />
<br />
Asides all dat...is wot ya really want... Ferget evraone else's opinion bout if it a GOOD weapon.  Ifn is sumpin ya want cuz it will make ya feel good dat ya set goal ferself ta get it an dey ya ventually be weilding dem den go fer it. Bank dat scale and waits ta tag along wit nudder guild doing PoA... find someone MQ fear thingie.. is doable!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tsebach</div><div class="date">05-15-2003, 01:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sell it at 55K? :)  Geez, I just bought one for 116k on Innoruuk... and I got a deal.  The average is 125 to 150... and for some reason it seems to be going up. &lt;shrug&gt;  Funny how servers deviate... I guess there is a lot of cash rolling around on Inny.  I see BoC's up for 450k.  Whether they sell for that or not, I dunno.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'm digressing.  I think the thing about epics now is that it is a rite of passage... but only if it means something to you.  If you simply want the best agro weapon you can get, I would stick with your GST and sell the green scale.  If you got it the way you say you did, there is no shame in that.  But there is a status of a sort that goes along with being &quot;epicized&quot; (love that conjugation).  If anything, the fact that guilds are less and less eager to help out with most epics nowadays makes it even more of a personal accomplishment.  And that guild thing is a factor in your decision as well... they probably won't help you kill Sev again later on if you change your mind, but you will most likely get upgrades similar to what you would get by selling the scale simply by raiding with your guild as they move on.  As for the rest of the pieces, the Wingblade is MQ'd on Inny for about 15k, so using the apparent rate of exchange that would be about 5k for you? :)  As has been said in other posts, the rest is cake.<br />
<br />
Also, there is the option of selling the GST once you have the epic and using that for some upgrages... I'm sure there are merits to having both, but if you are in a 'one or the other' mentality about it, it would be something to look into.<br />
<br />
Just options, I suppose... I guess essentially it comes down to whether completing the epic is going to satisfy you beyond it's mere statistics.  I eventually made that choice... and 3 years or so later it looks like I'll have my lightsabers this tuesday. ;)  Oh, and I sold a GST to raise part of that 116k. ;)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomb</div><div class="date">05-15-2003, 04:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lol, i see green scale regularly for 30k or so in bazaar on Terris.<br />
On the other hand I have only seen greatstaff of thunder in bazaar once when Truelove tried to resell it for 50k.<br />
Havent been in an exp group with another warrior using it or when playing my cleric so i cannot comment how good or bad the agro is(either insanely rare or warriors on TT dont like it much).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">05-15-2003, 05:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the reason you don't see them for sale is cause the warriors on TT like the GST too much.  There are 2 in my guild, that most likely won't leave, and I know of a few others who swear by them.  GST is a great weapon, I used one for a while and loved it.  Proc is good aggro, proc rate is good, and has nice dps.<br />
<br />
As for whether to sale the scale for one, thats really a personal choice.  I upgraded to a weapon above the GST, yet I am still close to finishing my epic, and will have it soon.  Even though it will be bagged 99% of the time, it still is a rite of passage to some people, me included.  Of course, I couldn't bring myself to ask my guild to go to PoA for it, and did plan on buying an MQ of the wingblade, until my guild decided they wanted to go to PoA for some other reasons also.<br />
<br />
If it will be a sense of accomplishment to you to finish it, keep the scale.  If you will get it and would feel disappointed if it's not a good enough weapon, then sell the scale.  If you do keep it, I'd work on collecting the cash for a GST anyway, since you'll probably get the cash faster than you can finish the epic.  Just find some way other than selling the green scale for the cash =)</div></div><hr />
