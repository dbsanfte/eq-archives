<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>SSharlon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Going to be unable to play for a few days,  can someone explain something for me.  <br />
<br />
I was under the assumption that our endurance pool would be setup similarly to how mana is for a caster,  in other words, our primary stat,  either stamina or strength or somethign new would be used to calculate our endurance pool.   Again, to better allign ourselves with the increased casters abilities an AA would be introduced to allow the raising of said primary stat to 355, ala casters.   <br />
<br />
This would allow for high end players to increase their endurance<br />
pools over mid level players in the same way high end casters have increased mana pools.   <br />
<br />
Now I just read the patch message and all I see is ambiguity,  and no mention of any new AA.<br />
<br />
Can someone explain to me how endurance is calculated ?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">**edit i might have been wrong on what affects endurance**<br />
<br />
also keep in mind the balancing is being rolled out in phase's I remember hearing something about having items that increase the total size (but not regen)... besides capping sta naturally of course...<br />
<br />
And technicallly melee (well warriors and knights haha) did get an equivalant... its called Planar Durability.....<br />
<br />
some aa that incerased total pool size would definatly be cool tho</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've heard it's dex that determines the endurance pool.  At any rate, with 305 on all melee stats, you still can't do more than 2 offensive discs back to back if you want to have any endurance left over for defensive discs and incite.  So right now the amount of endurance we have seems kind of inadequate.  If they don't intend to increase our endurance size, then the opening has to be very powerful abilities because just using Incite even intelligently can indefinitely lock up whatever endurance regen you have (and more likely you'll have a net loss of endurance), and consider you need half of your endurance left over just to use a defensive disc, that's not a lot of endurance to work with.  If they intend to increase our endurance pool/regen significantly via items/AAs, then the current numbers are fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rylaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Just using incite once, and not on every mob I was ending normal Ldon adventures at about 20-40 % endurance... and these were not very long adventures. The longest was perhaps 45 minutes or so.<br />
<br />
I have to admit I was looking at it dwindling down and being somewhat dismayed that if I had to use defensive or wanted to use something else I would probably run out of endurance and either tank the old fashioned way or have to pause to regen some... aka med.<br />
<br />
I'm looking forward to seeing what we have in store for our endurance pool and regen and or buffs that affect it.<br />
<br />
Incite is very nice although I've found it's not enough hate to just hit it and say break mez and have aggro, and sometimes it was not enough to last through a slow. I still needed to taunt and usually wait 2-3 times for a successful one at that before breaking mez.<br />
<br />
I'm still really hoping there are plans to fix taunt itself!<br />
<br />
Now that we see the message it's becoming apparent how much it really does fail.  Even on a success I often don't have the mob turn back on me. Even check with /assist and find it on whoever else.<br />
<br />
I don't think I'm alone in the massive amounts of taunt failures department. <br />
<br />
All in all though I am just glad we are finally getting some attention to our issues and I appreciate the hard work and thought being put into it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Splaktar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">From my testing in Time last night:<br />
<br />
Aggressive 60% Endurance.<br />
Precision 40% Endurance.<br />
Defensive 50% Endurance.<br />
<br />
There's also some information about how much Endurance these actually cost in the 'S' melee skill window.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>SSharlon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Certainly we can cut them some slack, since this is phase 1, but lets be honest here.  If you are gonna make our endurance similar to mana, you need to balance that stat across all levels of gear.  certainly a time equiped warrior 400+ in most main stats should have a significantly more amount of endurance than a velious armor equiped warrior who can hit 305 with buffs.<br />
<br />
I hope the devs can do this in phase 2 and beyond.<br />
<br />
Also, again I have not logged on yet,  but any existing gear showing up with + to endurance items?  If not include this in my previous statement,  if your gonna make it like mana, then make it like the current way mana is calculated.  Using 50% of your endurance on one disc just does not seem reasonable considering casters can chain cast their best spell over and over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Khumak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well they already said that items will be retroactively adjusted to include endurance.  I have yet to see anything with endurance on it so it stands to reason that they haven't done it yet.  I'm sure we'll see plenty of tweaking of both endurance pools and endurance regen in the next couple of months.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gromlok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Anyone but me find it hilariously funny to here Warriors talking about endurance like casters do about mana?<br />
<br />
Wootuz tells pakmelee: OOE!  Frax can you take over?<br />
Frax tells pakmelee: 40 END, good for a bit.<br />
Gromlok tells pakmelee: ROFLMAO!<br />
<br />
I was laughing my ass off while we were doing phase 3 in PoTime, I guess it just struck me funny  :)<br />
<br />
And then when one of the officers asks me if I'm ready to engage VZ he says: &quot;How's endurance Grom?&quot;.  I about fell out of my chair laughing :p <br />
<br />
Sorry... back to the discussion....</div></div><hr />
