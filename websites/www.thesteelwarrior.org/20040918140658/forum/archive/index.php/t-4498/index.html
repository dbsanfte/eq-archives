<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>paladiin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hmm, maybe I'm missing it, but seems it's only introducing a text to say when we fail a taunt.  Kind of redundant considering it's quite obvious when taunt fails.<br />
<br />
However, this states nothing on the potential of an on-demand agro skill with the new combat system though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Biggwinz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">How often does the aggro factor on stuns fail?<br />
<br />
If they had to code in a message that means that there is a chance to fail built into the skill!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>arative</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I like the fact that we see when taunt fails, people have been asking for that ability for a while on this board. Shows that the devs are actually listening.</div></div><hr />

Heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bloodravenger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Heh on demand aggro would be like Diesiese Cloud for Sk's back in the day when no matter where the mob was at, an Sk could cast that and mob would go running to him.<br />
<br />
Pallies just use stun, then walk up and commence Melee attack, It does rather well on Inc since hate list is not a mess at the time, but clearly person fitting a mob for a length will stop him from being able to rip off the mob from him and pally would be forced to move and restun and taunt to get aggro...<br />
<br />
Same is with CD and fear, but fear has chance to fear the mob..<br />
<br />
-------<br />
<br />
If stun fails to land it sometimes can not take aggro hold whereas CD does still gain aggro when resisted.   Some times it will seem as CD will not get aggro hold on resist or even if not resisted this only means puller meleed mob a tad and i have to move to mob to get better aggro off.</div></div><hr />
