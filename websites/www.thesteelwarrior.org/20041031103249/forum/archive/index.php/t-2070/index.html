<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tormaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi, warrior from Luclin server here with yet another question on what weapons would you use.<br />
<br />
I just got a Blade of Carnage and recently have gotten a Greatstaff of Thunder , Splitblade of Destruction.<br />
<br />
My question is this, in grouping and raiding situations which would you use:<br />
<br />
Blade of Carnage / Splitblade of Destruction<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
Greatstaff of Thunder</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Group = GoT<br />
Raiding = BoC/SBoD</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Truelove</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">With respect how can you have got to the point in your EQ career that you have 3 of the highest end droppable weapons in Warriordom and you havent thought in which situation to use them?<br />
<br />
The BoC is the highest agro tradeable weapon, use it when you want taunt - otherwise bag it.<br />
<br />
If you raiding and dont want agro then a 2hander is prolly best - but the staff has a stun proc which if you got a good run would turn the mob - you may consider selling it and getting a lower agro windblade.<br />
<br />
Sorry.... how did you get all that stuff and not know this kind of info?</div></div><hr />

Hmm Ebay, Player Auctions, Hand me downs from retired characters?  I dunno . . .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dalbe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">For raiding or grouping when your not tanking, pick up a Windblade or War Marshalls Bladed Staff</div></div><hr />

 I dont know maybe just maybe he wanted to make sure of his decsion with his warrior brethern. On the other hand it could just be a &quot;Look at my uber weapons you dont have&quot; post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Smakz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">first thing you do, sell the BoC.  cause you obviously dont understand what the weapon is. <br />
<br />
If you have to ask about if you should use it ... you dont need to have it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tormaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The reason I was asking is because other warriors in my guild told me to use the Greatstaff of Thunder ALL THE TIME and I did not agree with this so I decided I would post here and see what others thought. I figured it was as people said, but I just wanted to be sure that I was making the right decision, is that so bad?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>weidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I think Mr.Envy let out some of the harsh remarks =)<br />
Those sure are überweapons and i for once will probably not own <br />
any of them.<br />
<br />
Well anyway, good luck to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I dont own a BoC or a Splitblade but if I did.  I would use the Dual wield for groups when you cant depend on the other party members to mind the agro.  And I would use the GSoT for the big stuff when the reposts really matter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">go find an axe of the kromzek kings rotting and that piece of sh*t is one of the nicer DPS weapons with about ZERO chance of ever getting aggro unless your MT-type is wielding rusty weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">4 Modes I use &amp; Equip for &amp; how I'd use your equip:<br />
<br />
1. Normal exp (you tank):<br />
<br />
Boc/SBoD *or* GSOT...either way will work...if you lack a haster use dual wield...GSOT lacks agro with less than best ench haste.<br />
<br />
2. Raid (you tank)<br />
<br />
BoC + some other agro procing weapon you don't have (new toy from Chardok B comes to mind)<br />
<br />
3. Normal Exp (you not tank)<br />
<br />
I would not advise any of the weapons you have listed.  Find a non procing 2 hander (war marshall or windblade come to mind)<br />
<br />
4. Raid (you not tank)<br />
<br />
I would find a fast 1 hander NON PROCCING combo mate (shortblade of lightening?) for the split blade of destruction.  You can then stay in play for agro and swap in BoC/aetaunt/defensive quickly if you need to step up to the plate and tank. <br />
<br />
/shrug just my 2 coppers</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Grablock</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Why post stuff like this? <br />
<br />
Honestly does it make you feel better measuring the size of your penis?<br />
<br />
Staying happy with his 5k GSoT</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Hi, This board isn't for flaming people. Let's not turn this into the safehouse. One of the better boards for commenting with helpful stuff or just letting a post drop into oblivion.<br />
<br />
Please.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Sounds like people are making a few assumptions and holding them up as gospel. <br />
<br />
BoC best tradeable agro weapon and stuff, blah blah.<br />
<br />
I thought I was gonna be the uber tank when I got my first XP group after getting a BoC.  BoC + red blade = 2 hate proc weapons and agro was gonna be no probs at all.  <br />
<br />
Seriously in practice tho, the only time I pull out the BoC now is when I am tanking with defensive or evasive because in all other occasions the 20 extra DPS I get from using my 2hs owns the agro I get from the BoC's shit proc rate, and using the red blade off hand makes it a pretty poor DPS combo.<br />
<br />
Maybe this guy has found the same thing, that duel wield can't match 2handers for DPS and the poor proc rate of a velious weapon doesnt compensate for it especially when compared to the proc rate on GSoT.  He's certainly not the only warrior I know who has bagged a BoC + DPS 1hs for a GSoT.<br />
<br />
Its no wonder when you've got people harping on about how the BoC is Sony's gift to warriors that you'd post a question on the boards when something like the GSoT exceeds your expectations so much and that you'd want to hear from other peoples experiences aswell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Rhagulim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I agree with Flair's assessment: when not MT or offtanking you are there for dps only and must be careful NOT to draw aggro, and for that a 2h weapon with a low aggro proc or no proc is best.  I would recommend a windblade, excellent ratio with no proc, and probably easy for you to acquire.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Its no wonder when you've got people harping on about how the BoC is Sony's gift to warriors that you'd post a question on the boards when something like the GSoT exceeds your expectations so much and that you'd want to hear from other peoples experiences aswell. <br />
<br />
1. Its been fairly well documented in these forums that the BoC proc rate aint all its cracked up to be.  I personally think the items &quot;awe factor&quot; exceeds its performance (going back to its status in Velious and the fact it is tradeable).<br />
<br />
2. Its also been very well documented in these forums that the GSOT has been one of the single best gifts given to the non uber guild warrior in eons.<br />
<br />
3.  Just cause a couple of people jumped on this poor soul don't assume everyone here is hostile.  This thread is an abberation in that regard (well other than the outhouse area!!)</div></div><hr />
