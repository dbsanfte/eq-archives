I think i will resell it for 35k, would that be a fair price?<br />

Heal will be only at 1.4% around that time with makes it like 20min for a full heal.<br />

Sqar  If you want to heal, play a priest. Warriors are not meant to heal. Cobalt BP is a utility item that has some usefulness, it was not meant to be used as a primary mode of healing.</div></div><hr />

Your bind wound isn't maxed then, because BW &gt; Invig BP at capped skill.  Bind Wound + Fungi &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Invig BP.<br />
<br />
Dump it.  Try to get a fungi, far better tool.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh, and healing will is ass.  If you need to use healing will, you would be better off using the endurance on Furious or Fortitude to just avoid the damage to begin with.</div></div><hr />

I stuck with the Cobalt BP to level 65, lol... &amp; then I got an LDoN BP. 100hp heal is VERY nice for high-end when you have to solo for VT shards (what a bitch.) BW only goes up to 50%, 75% if you waste your AAs on it. So keep the Cobalt BP I'd say</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">02-04-2004, 08:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can bind wound to 70% at 201 skill.  I haven't clicked my BP in I dunno how long, but I still use bind wound occasionally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drunder50</div><div class="date">02-04-2004, 08:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Unless you are soloing alot (Not that common i dont think for a warrior), I would recommend getting rid of the Cobalt BP and get one of the invis items as mentioned earlier. When in Exp groups or raids, you typically have a healer of some sort.  I found it extremely frustrating relying on other classes to provide the necessaties for mobility so I took some time and and got me a Pegasus Feather Cloak (Alot of time, actually) for lev and saved and bought the Incarn BP. Life is soo much easier now getting from point a to point b. You wont regret losing the Cobalt BP in exchange for invis. Also recommend working on BW.  <br />
<br />
Enjoy!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
edit: fixed typo, my skill is 210 not 20 ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">02-04-2004, 02:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When I used to solo a lot I used tons of bandages.  With 201+ skill I believe you get 80ish hps per bandage, so in 30 seconds you can heal 240 hps with 3 bandaids or 200 hps with the cobalt breastplate.  If you wear a Fungi while bandaging you will get 75 hps in regen in that time as well so obviously Fungi + bandaids is way better than the cobalt bp (assuming you are over 57 and have &gt; 201 bind would skill).  Bandaids alone beat it except for the fact that you have to carry them or click the guaze press.<br />
<br />
I have had a warlord breastplate in the past and now have one of these..<br />
<br />
earring of vigor <br />
<br />
I have almost never clicked either of them.<br />
<br />
Of course now I have something better than any of the above options....a cleric bot</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you have 20 point skill in BW, and 1 First Aid AA, you can not bandage to 80 percent.<br />
<br />
So certainly that is a typo.<br />
<br />
The original poster, being level 52, with no fungi ... well his self-healing capabilities are probably better off for NOW with the cobalt BP. 7 minutes is not a long time to wait for 90 percent of your health. You shouldn't be fighting mobs that take you down to 10 percent life to begin with. Fight mobs that take you down to 30, 40 or 50 percent health. That cuts down on your healing time dramatically.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">02-04-2004, 03:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">typo, meant 210 :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zcao</div><div class="date">02-04-2004, 04:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So as far as for the Gungi verver tunic, 15 hit pt per tick is quite amzing.  But that is like around 100k on my server.  I just wondering if i get some armor like iksar ceremonial plate which has regen on ti(3hp per tick) would that stack with my innate AA regen?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">02-04-2004, 05:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gungi Verer tunic? Ok, now you're all  just baiting me.<br />
<br />
:P<br />
<br />
Anyways, Ikky BP, Fungi, whatever ... it all contributes to the worn regen CAP. Which is 35 per tick. <br />
<br />
That is a cap. You will  not get any more hps per tick from WORN effects after that.<br />
<br />
HOWEVER ... spells stack with that.<br />
<br />
Innate abilities, like the AA you're asking about, do indeed stack with that.</div></div><hr />
