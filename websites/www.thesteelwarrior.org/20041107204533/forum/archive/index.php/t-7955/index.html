<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ubercheerio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey hey everyone,<br />
<br />
The title of the post states it.  There are too many ogre/barbarian warriors out there, and most classes have ugly females, so it basically left me with the choices of DE, Gnome, Wood elf and human.  Humans are extremely boring because they're just...normal...<br />
<br />
I've had a couple wood elves before, i'm afraid people would ask me for a SoW every five minutes.<br />
<br />
DE, Had a couple, while not a terrible idea, plate graphic = skull, looks terrible!<br />
<br />
That leaves me with a gnome.  Short, cute, tacky dress sometimes but they also get to learn tinkering and a few other things.  I cant slam, and i have low starting stats, but with time i can up my stats no problem.<br />
<br />
So the question remains...is this a cool change of pace or a moronic thing to do?  Also, if you happen to be a gnome warrior, let me know, i'm curious to see how many others have had this urge for difference.</div></div><hr />

From the start you can buy tinkered armor with right click haste/sow/str/dex throwing hammers and invis.<br />
<br />
We never need shrink, and WE crown is easy to get to grow you if you want.<br />
<br />
Tinkering TS is a fun skill to play with. You can make some damn cool items.<br />
<br />
Not being able to slam and being stuned is a down side. But once you get level 55 your kick will stun, and there are AAs that will make you resists stuns 80% of the time.</div></div><hr />

Honestly though?  As a Rogue who tends to eyeball prospective tanks quite often, I always prefer Gnomes, Wood-Elves (even illusioned ones) and other offbeat types.  It's more often than not the Marshall Barshemgud Ogres that seem to be clueless for pickup situations.</div></div><hr />

That can be a major pain during fights or when you're just in a hurry.  What ever race you choose, just be sure to pick a deity.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>oomwarrior</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">If i'm not mistaking, the biggest advantage for nome and assling war is their &quot;race&quot; xp bonus.  they have a 10% xp bonus over the baseline(human) on xp/level.  So, if your game is to get to level 65 on the bullet train, then nomes are the way to go since they also get to tink.  <br />
<br />
but seriously, nomes are very strong tanks because they get there faster then any race in the game.  verant has removed the &quot;class&quot; xp bonus/penalty, but I believe the &quot;race&quot; xp bonus/penalty is still there.  Ogre has the worst xp penalty for a warrior but they do make up for it in the immune to frontal stun department.  <br />
<br />
as anyone would tell you, play whatever race you enjoy because at the end of the day, only 2 stats really matters and that is HP and AC.  it's almost impossible to get to level 65 w/o getting max sta/str these days.  so dont let those stats be a concern.  if anything, concentrate on CHA as a primary stat because it's the hardest stat to raise for a war IMO and it becomes rather important when you start to tank real mobs.  Looking back, IMO, the primary stats you should focus on are CHA and AGI because everything else can be buffed to the max rather easily.(excluding int/wis of course but those are useless)  nomes offer a good balance between CHA/AGI/DEX IMO for future development as you gain gear.  And although asslings are better in AGI/DEX, their CHA is lower and cant use nome armor in the early game which is another great xp advantage for nomes over asslings.<br />
<br />
so... what do you get for being a football for the real tank races?<br />
race xp bonus<br />
immunity to shrink:) / innate cornering ability:)<br />
tink<br />
nome armor<br />
&quot;balanced&quot; stats for development/growth<br />
GOGGLES!!!!<br />
<br />
and remember, ogre dont get as much out of the stun resist AA as all of the other races, so in a way, they are nerfed, AA wise, for losing 1/2 of their stun resist AA's to their innate ability.<br />
<br />
well, hope that helped.  looking forward to playing more nomeball:D<br />
Ohohemm da Ogre:p</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>oomwarrior</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">Trolls and lizards used to have the worst xp modifier I thought?These modifiers still in place?<br />
<br />
actually ogre used to have the worst xp mod due to immune to frontal stun, then it was ikky for regen and AC, then troll for regen etc...   Ikky and ogre were really close on the xp mod tho.  they both have like a +30% mod if i remember correctly.  nomes and asslings both had a -10% mod cuz nobody wanted to be footballs.  <br />
<br />
they abolished the &quot;class&quot; xp mod a long time ago due to the excessive whining of the hybrids back when they REALLY sucked (kunark/velious) but if I remember the patch message correctly, the &quot;race&quot; xp mod was left untouched.  i remember back in the day when a ogre SK had a xp mod of something like +60% or something crazy like that.  costed them 18million xp points to get to level 50 i think it was and only costed a nome war like 10 million xp points to get to level 50.  <br />
<br />
if anyone with a sniffer or working on the EQEmu project can step in and confirm this that would be great.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ogre is great if you are just starting out and don't have much money.  The frontal stun is just like having free aa's basicly.<br />
<br />
Gnomes are good for one thing only(shrink does not count to me).  They have some of the highest innate cha.  Charisma affects your chance for DI or Death pack to go off and its a very hard stat to raise for warriors.<br />
<br />
Frogloks are just a gimmick and a joke to me.  I could never see myself playing one.  All of the old school people spent forever in Lguk when it was the top exp zone and then moved onto Seb.  I have probably killed a few 100,000 frogs.  Just could never picture myself talking the role of a European ontrey.  Like frogloks could really kick the crap out of trolls?  Specialy after they had been hunted by xp starving people.<br />

In the end the only thing that matters are Evil Races &gt;  Good.</div></div><hr />
