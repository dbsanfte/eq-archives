LOL this ability is just flat out comical.  So if we happen to find a mob with a damage shield, and IF it doesnt get dispelled immediately and IF we happen to land an attack with our offhand during that period in which people are trying to dispell it, we MIGHT decrease the amount of damage we take from it?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Northerner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It is also the result of SoE patially listening to class complaints but not really understanding them.  One of the things Rogues brought up as an issue was that DSes chew us up in a hurry and can be a PITA in many situations.  I personally figured this was a non-starter (for the exact reasons that are listed above) but apparently someone thought this would be a neato line to persue anyhow.  Offhand only and a percentage reduction though is simply laughable.  Even if there are undispellable DSes coming up, we still won't melee these targets very long with or without this AA.</div></div><hr />

Will this be a little help with avoidance for Knights with the masters of all weapons excluded since a shield isn't really a weapon and we wouldn't know how to block with one?<br />
<br />
Or, will Warriors be wielding our awesomely high DMG/DLY ratio DBoW's with the game's ultimate aggro machine for Warriors - FB4 shields? In which case the lowered damage from offhand DS hardly matters do it?<br />
<br />
I know! We'll pull out the Demerix's we're all hiding in our bags, grab a shield, and tank like an oom SK.<br />
<br />
As a Dwarf, I'm also looking forward to buying night vision with AA's just so I can get See Invis. Go Go racial advantages.<br />

<br />
If Slippery Strikes is five levels, that would make off-hand attacks completely immune to Riposte the way it's listed now. I see that as nothing but a monster benefit.<br />
<br />
A while back it was established that off-hand damage aggro was gimped because of the lack of damage bonus. How much of a DB does Sinister Strikes give, and does it correctly add to aggro? Has this been parsed anywhere?<br />
<br />
Crazed Onslaught increasing flurries also increases melee-based aggro, or has someone managed to prove that flurries are flukes that create no aggro like Ripostes?<br />
<br />
If I'm reading these right, there are several flat, baseline upgrades for warriors and their tanking abilities.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">the damage bonus of Sinister Strike is delay/3.5 rounded down.<br />
<br />
In practical terms, this means a delay 21 weapon has a damage bonus of 6, which happens to be the delay of just about any 1hander minus the warrior only primary these days.<br />
<br />
It's not even clear if damage bonus adds aggro at all, and it's pretty much impossible to verify either way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>aguktawarrior</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The only really decent new AA is shields having a chance to block. But thatll prolly be low to allow for future expansions to add to it.<br />

What we need are interesting things to do (the AAs above are all boring, for lack of a better word, the defensive ones are useful but still uninspiring):<br />
<br />
 short duration snare (5 seconds.. instant action.. uses endurance and 5 min reuse)<br />
<br />
 1 second duration AE stun based on rampage (with a long reuse and only if using a 2HB weapon.. prohibts procs during rampage )<br />
<br />
 head butt  (or head slap or a 'forearm shiver') stun that works on humanoids (with a moderate reuse.. 5 min?)<br />
<br />
'bum-rush' ability smiliar to WoW's Charge (w/o the stun).. that burns endurance and grants us a 5 second burst of speed to engage a mob and generates some agro, 5 min reuse but heavy on endurance cost.<br />
<br />
Defensive Extension.. allows you to extend the duration of Defensive/Evasive for 30 seconds once every 90 minutes.  Heavy AA cost.</div></div><hr />

PoN would have a freakin heart attack if warriors got any of those abilities(and rightly for most of them IMO), and I guarantee they're never going do do anything that makes defensive better.<br />
<br />
Personally I'm looking forward to trying out Resolute Defiance.  An instant 5k heal is certainly a very powerful ability.  I could see using this as a first heal to save aggro on clerics, and it could virtually eliminate exp group deaths from late CHs.  The 100dps dot will make it so you have to be careful when you use it though, on a hard fight you could easily kill yourself with it, but I can see this becoming crucial in some situations.  I believe the dot can also be removed with radiant cure?</div></div><hr />

of course they would, kind of like how many feel about knights getting any sort of defensive :)  EDIT: and no i'm not trying to make this a class balance post.</div></div><hr />

All you get is paladins tanking equal to a warrior with defensive in 95 percent of stunable mobs plus paladins tanking much better than warriors without defensive in 100 percent of stunable mobs.  The only mobs that warriors will be better will be raid mobs.<br />

Why would you use a Warrior to tank regular junk over Paladins?  Because we can still aggro wayyyyyy better compare to a weapon + shield Paladin (Paladin weaopns tend to suck for aggro, even despite their ratio, due to lack of good procs).  Even on stunnable mobs, Paladin just becomes mitigation but a Warrior still tanks better.</div></div><hr />

A shield is going to have more AC and now a chance to block. It seems obvious that a shield is going to be a more defensive tanking setup than two weapons.<br />

In EQ this would give you (aggro) procs from the offhand and more damage. In general, a more offensive tanking setup than weapon and shield.<br />

Um our aggro is different, not IMO &quot;better&quot;. A Paladin is not dependent on Weapon procs for aggro - they use spells. Therefore it is much less important to them wether they are weilding a 2Hdr or weapon and shield when tanking, except w&amp;S provides more stats/effects/AC/HPs a chance to block and less damage.<br />
<br />
Yes, IMO giving shields an inate chance to block is a greater boost for Paladins than Warriors. They have better ratio 1Hndrs and since they use spells to get aggro their aggro capability is largely undimished when using a shield. Having said this, it is possible that SoE does not intend to encourage Warriors to use w&amp;s as much as they make them attractive to Knights. Umm I suppose the same can be said about 2Hdrs for simular reasons.<br />

Yes the increased shield blocking is a boon for Knights, and a nice novelty for warriors.  It would be great to be able to ensure having agro using a sword/board, however as most warrior agro is based on procs, i'd still rather have the extra weapon procing anger3 than a shield.   Even with a DB/EoE both anger3 aug'd i've lost agro to people on occasion, a shield would only make that happen more in exchange for a couple of % less damage to the tank? I'd rather the  tank have more HP and hold more solid agro than risk a nebulous chance of an extra shield block.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>callius maximus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">perhaps bahs aggro needs to be increased so it works well  using a FB shield.<br />
Though using a swrd/shield combo there has to be negatives over  dual wield. When MT for a raid your dps hardly matter so aggro is the only negative to using a shield.</div></div><hr />

Not that it matters, at least in exp groups.  Paladins will own us with their stuns.  Imagine when they have 4-5 stuns up that are effective on everything up to L65 and 2 or 3 that are effective up to 70.  grrrr.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Daggorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I don't see the point of adding a shield block if you don't make shields produce hate just as well as a weapon with 2 anger procs.<br />
<br />
- On a long fight, Once you run through Evasive/Defensive you can bring out the shield for some damage blocking.  By the time Defensive runs out you should have enough aggro to not need to worry about losing the second weapon.<br />
<br />
- Offtanking in groups where theres a weak or no main healer, help keep damage down so MT can be focused on.<br />
<br />
- Hunting in groups without a slower it can help offset the faster attacks if their not all hitting. <br />
<br />
- ect...<br />
<br />
Sure, this isn't an earth shattering AA, but it gives use some more use out of the shields most of us carry. Its a situational AA to help us with a situational Item.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>aspit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">im very much against knights getting a variety of stalwart endurance, which it appears they have in beta.  The last thing knights need is a high chance to shake off stun.  They already have instant horse and da, lets just make training easier for them seriously!  Stun has very little effect on knights aside from casting, and this problem stuns from a channeling issue not from a stun issue.  The utility of antistun on knight is negligible at best in a pve environment aside from the fact that it allows them to train better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Would disagree with you there Aspit for a few reasons:<br />
<br />
1. Stun Resistance is something thats pretty valuable for Knights and also happens to be something we can't really get large amounts of.  With the way Warrior aggro is now, Knights need their melee aggro to keep pace with Warriors, so getting stunned costs us that.<br />
<br />
2. The second reason its valuable is because Persistent Casting doesn't go off very much (15% of the time we get stunned), and then assuming we pass the channeling check also when PC works (won't often) we're still stunned after the spell casts leaving us helpless.  This isn't quite as big a deal for Paladins as it is for SK's though.<br />
<br />
3. What I started to hint at in point 2.  Pulling - Being able to channel through a stun isn't nearly the same thing as flat out resisting stuns, I pull a very large amount of my guilds raids, a good 90% of my deaths are a result of being stunned, and no it's not a channeling problem when a selo speed hasted to uber light speed quad hitting kyv stuns me and kills me in less time than it takes me to type in &quot;bye&quot; when pulling in Txevu.<br />
<br />
4. One of the reasons Warriors got Tactical Mastery is that Ogres can resist stuns and it put non Ogre Warriors at a significant disadvantage correct?  Well, Ogres can be SK's also.<br />
<br />
Oh I would also like to point something out, I had Persistent Casting on the FIRST day of GoD.  Since then I've noticed the skill actually work (defined as I channel through the stun and channel through the spell with it going off afterwards) 4 times, it's actually been of use when it worked twice (both cases involving FD).  So as you can see simply letting us channel through stuns doesn't work all that great, we need to actually avoid the stuns in the first place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>mishratm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Knights is a term that includes paladins. They need absolutely no help generating agro.  This *may* be something that could help shadowknights, but it should definitely not be applied to paladins.<br />
Just because a warrior gets a nice skill that you may want, doesn't mean you should get it. There have to be some benefits to playing a warrior over playing a hybrid, and they shouldn't be restricted to a couple of useful discplines and the ability to duel wield. There are meant to be downsides to playing a class (if there weren't everyone would play it) and sometimes I think &quot;knights&quot; struggle to see this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Frax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Would disagree with you there Aspit for a few reasons:<br />
<br />
1. Stun Resistance is something thats pretty valuable for Knights and also happens to be something we can't really get large amounts of.  With the way Warrior aggro is now, Knights need their melee aggro to keep pace with Warriors, so getting stunned costs us that.<br />
<br />
2. The second reason its valuable is because Persistent Casting doesn't go off very much (15% of the time we get stunned), and then assuming we pass the channeling check also when PC works (won't often) we're still stunned after the spell casts leaving us helpless.  This isn't quite as big a deal for Paladins as it is for SK's though.<br />
<br />
3. What I started to hint at in point 2.  Pulling - Being able to channel through a stun isn't nearly the same thing as flat out resisting stuns, I pull a very large amount of my guilds raids, a good 90% of my deaths are a result of being stunned, and no it's not a channeling problem when a selo speed hasted to uber light speed quad hitting kyv stuns me and kills me in less time than it takes me to type in &quot;bye&quot; when pulling in Txevu.<br />

Tactical Mastery has nothing to do with stuns or getting stunned. The AA is called Stalwart Endurance.. and is not nearly as powerful as you think.  Ogres are still frontal melee stun immune, and have the same chance (like 10 or 15% tops) to not get stunned from other angles.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Ya thanks for pointing that out, I meant Stalwart Endurance was reading something else about that AA while typing my post up and typed it instead.<br />
<br />
Mishratam, traditionally in EQ SK's and Paladins have shared the same melee capabilities exactly the same.  So if SK's were going to get it Paladins should too.  Only exceptions to that I think are Slay Undead (we have Scythe spells to keep pace), Holy Forge, and Leechcurse.</div></div><hr />

Anybody seen a parse on stalwart endurance?  I haven't but it certainly seems like more than 10-15% to me.  I consider it one of the better PoP AAs, but it could just be a matter of perception.</div></div><hr />

I held off on getting Stalwart Endurance until I had nothing else to get because I'm an ogre.  It does nothing for me if I'm facing a mob but I've seen a HUGE difference in the frequency that I get stunned while pulling.  I used to get stunned constantly pulling stuff that was fast enough to get into melee range with me before I got back to my group.  Now I very rarely get stunned except by spell effects.</div></div><hr />

Shield resistance is decent on a few select pve encounters but 20% doesnt do much of anything.  What it basically does is give monks and rogues the ability to dual wield in pvp and not get destroyed by a priest with a 10 point ds or a mage without a healer.<br />
<br />
Personally i love the idea of getting dragon punch.  A it gives non tanking warriors an ability other than tanking and dps (positioning) and makes us a beast in pvp along with weapon stuns, pest shock stuns, and kickstun.</div></div><hr />

Most of Oow aa's I like.  Finishing blow up to lvl 65 is going to be the win.  Regen end aa's help in GoD an immense amount of time now as is. Why would getting more suck? More dps is always a good thing with Adv Tm, flurry etc.  Slippery Strikes is going to be huge for DW'ing.  Upgrades to Warlords tenacity. I dont know how you could call an instant 5k heal worthless.  Granted the 100dps dot you'd have to be careful with but could save your group / raid in situations.  <br />
<br />
 We all pay to play this game. I still enjoy it and am looking forward to OoW.  GoD has been a fun expantion, I loved when it first came out and everything was assrape.  It's pretty simple if you dont like the ideas they come with just dont buy the exp.</div></div><hr />

It's impossible to tell if the OoW AAs are 'worth it' because you can't buy any of them yet (and they all have a cost of 1, which is obviously wrong).  My guess, though, is that the purple bar HPs can't possibly be more expensive than Sturdiness so that's a good deal there.  Purple bar HP is every bit as good as HP elsewhere since it's not like you mitigate worse just because you're on the ground (okay so you can't attack while unconscious but not like you stay there very long).  <br />
<br />
Our Archtype AAs are pretty solid, and our class ones are all pretty good (Resolute Defiance is going to be pretty important IMO).  You'll be surprised how many people swears by DBoW + shield and it's certainly manageable aggro especially with the super shields coming from GoD endgame (Bulwark of Living Stone, Aegis of Midnight).  The flurry/tactical mastery upgrade aren't too exciting but more DPS never hurts.  Overall the only questionable AA we get is shield block but if you're someone who never uses a shield (like me) then you'd never need it to begin with.  And if you actually believed in shields, now they can be better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You dont want to be judged by how many AA you have but youre perfectly happy to make fucked up assumptions about people based on how many they have. Thats a mighty fine double standard you have there.<br />
<br />
You dont need to play the game for 40 hours a week to have 600+ aa, you simply need to budget your time into being productive when you are on. I generally play about 20-30 hours a week, sometimes more sometimes less. That includes raiding, yet I have 690AA and a cleric with 200. Its easy to do if you dont faff about with your ingame time.</div></div><hr />

Okay enough of the attacking each other.  It doesn't matter if you have 189 aa or 600 million AA.  Number 1 its what you can do with your character called skill and knowledge.  I've been around since the beginning of time and its those 2 things that show you know how to play a tank.<br />
<br />
Now lets get the subject back on track which was what everyone thought about the OOW AA's btw which aren't the actual ones until they are on live so a lot can change between now and then.<br />
<br />
My opinion on AA's I have seen is that warriors were given some AA's  enhancing AA skills they all ready had.  I don't really see anything new that stands out.  But I will reserve total judgement until I see what AA's we receive and see them in action.<br />
<br />
Also remember that &quot;I like everyone else will respect your opinion if you will also respect my opinion of your opinion&quot;.</div></div><hr />

I'm in two minds about that particular skill. On paper it looks nice, but primary hotkey bank space is very valuable to me, and using 1 out of the 10 hotkeys on something with a 1hour+ reuse is a bit annoying. They should make the re-use time 30 mins instead, then it would be easier to swallow.</div></div><hr />

The worst that can happen is that you use it and you still die, but in that case you don't lose anything either.

Although it is nowhere as reliable as Furious/Fortitude, I'm certainly more willing to waste a Warlord's Tenacity than a disc, and also you can use Warlord's Tenacity while under a disc whereas you can't do that with Furious/Fortitude, unless you click very fast but you might still regret it later since you no longer have your defensive disc.<br />
<br />
On the dot part, I thought you get dotted for the same as the heal because of the PvP penalty (source of dot came from yourself, which is a player), the same way necro Lich line don't do full advertised damage to them, at least that's what I recall hearing once.  I seem to recall PvP penalty at 2/3 and it certainly fits the numbers, e.g. Resolute Defiance heal 5000 dot 680 for 11 ticks = 7480 X 2/3 ~= 5000.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>NeoKlux</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">yeah sure, the hp regen cap boost, the minor DPS aa, the lame dual weild aa ? oh no wait your obviously speaking of lightning reflex and innate defense upgrade that every freaking class get ! omg i can boost my mitigation , oh wait wizard can too ! sooo leet <br />
<br />
so we get a warlord tenacity upgrade, a shield block  ? thats your not so bad, solid upgrades ? you kiding ?<br />
<br />
so as a 2Hander war i get a group anti late heal aa and some more dps ? coming with the general line aa, i for sure shouldnt bitch about it !<br />
<br />
sorry if care more about mitigation and aggro. With SoE people still working on oow aa, people claiming they are happy with the actual set up turn me crazy<br />
<br />

I think his point was that not everyone plays the same way. Imagine that.. variety in EQ.</div></div><hr />

Perhaps not, but if the warrior class-specific weapon for the expansion is a 1-hander, it kinda makes sense that they would put in mostly dual wield AA.  If you really want to try to hold aggro with a DPS weapon more power to ya but personally if the best aggro weapons are 1-handers, then that's what I'm gonna be using primarily.</div></div><hr />

Well in Time that isn't really the case.  DBotW/EoE are pretty much equal to Vanazir for DPS.  Has anyone actually parsed a great maul of the mighty vs. BBoB/Tacvi level offhander?  I realize that there aren't many of these weapons around yet, but it would be an interesting piece of data.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u70"><b>dethvegi1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p70">I had a huge parse from  Gmom vs  Fleshbiter / Demerix somewhere in one of my log files. I realize BBoB will outdmg Fleshbiter by a good margin but it should give some comparison.  Will look for it in a bit</div></div><hr />

do you mind if i would have been more pleased with both dual weild and 2H aa ? <br />
Thing of the past ? i just dont like dual weild, thing is i was strongly hoping that those lazy dev would re use the epic 1 system  :mad: <br />
<br />
about the aa,well if you are happy with it i guess you deserve it  :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
maybe the fake crap LH we get do something at your pally inner side  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>Boub</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">NeoKlux, why do you think other classes getting defensive AAs is a bad thing ? Do on your raids never non warriors get hit ? shall every class die by the slightest damage because they are not warriors ?<br />
<br />
There are already the silk - leather - chain - plate - melee - nonmelee differences, as well as the innate bonus mitigation warriors have.<br />
<br />
If only warriors got those defensive AAs, it would increase the gap without need, if all get them the current gaps stay the same. Fine.</div></div><hr />
