<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">04-30-2003, 03:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Im thinking of upgrading my cloak and the following three look like the most likely upgrades<br />
<br />
cloak of greater pernicity 25k<br />
<br />
cloak of the maelstrom 5k<br />
<br />
heirophants cloak 10k<br />
<br />
from the stats the pernicity cloak has the most, but in terms of hp/sta i dont know if its worth the extra 20 k over cloak of the maelstrom. what would you guys suggest, assuming 25k isnt the problem - is it worth it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do the quest.<br />
<br />
It's MUCH cheaper.<br />
<br />
I recently had this exact quandry. I lucked into a Hiero cloak that I had been after for ages.<br />
<br />
At the exact same time I found the elusive boar horn for sale, and finally had the items I needed to finish the pernicity quest.<br />
<br />
At level 52, Hiero had 3 less hit points, and 2 less AC.<br />
<br />
But the dex on Hiero put me over 200 dex.<br />
<br />
The str on pernicity put me over 1k atk easily.<br />
<br />
I was using pernicity until a friend offered me 3 valorium rings for the pernicity cloak. <br />
<br />
Much better deal for me.<br />
<br />
In any event, if you go PERNICITY ... just do the quest.<br />
<br />
The two items to get from innovation are EASY to snag.<br />
<br />
The other two items from the higher planes are tradable.<br />
<br />
Cloak sells for around 12k on Povar. I got the horn and the shard for 4k each. So I saved 4 thousand plat just doing the quest. I shudder to think how much plat YOU could save if they sell for 25k on your server.<br />
<br />
Good luck. Have fun.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If yours isn't, then that Pernacity cape is purty nice.<br />
<br />
Edit :  I should stop being a dumbass and check magelo's before I post.<br />
<br />
Your stamina is close enough to capped.  Wear a Heiro.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">04-30-2003, 06:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ive donesome fiddling with magelo - the hiero cloak certainly bumps up my hitpoints nicely. However if i do get it my AC drops from 1205 to 1189 unbuffed. Given my current set up, i really dont know where i can get a significant AC boost to offset that.<br />
<br />
My other planned upgrades are 2 valorium rings,a mosquito earring and a clattering bone necklace - all of which should put my unbuffed hps to about 4200-4300 but wont any make any significant change to my ac.<br />
<br />
However, i think to upgrade to 4sta and 75 hps and lose the 10 ac that the seahorse hide cloak is probably a good tradeoff right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">04-30-2003, 08:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah the heiro and pernicity cloaks are about par with each other ( heiro esp. if you're closer to max stats, pernicity if you need the extra str/sta  ), and the maelstrom basically is the &quot;no-frills&quot; version of stat buffage.<br />
<br />
I'd go with the Heiro Cloak tho ( as you saw on your fiddling with magelo ).</div></div><hr />

<br />
ATM you have hiero, well keep it :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
You could kill a dragon in WW for a head, or you could kill Dlammaz Stormslayer in Kael much quicker and easier for the cloak :).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dandolo1</div><div class="date">04-30-2003, 12:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just went though this entire debate myself, and here is what I came up with:<br />
<br />
On Torv<br />
Heirophants Cloak 20k<br />
Cloak of Greater Pernicity 19k<br />
Iksar Hide Cape 9k<br />
Cloak of the Maelstrom 4k<br />
<br />
My Sta is maxed and so is yours, so the Cloak of Greater Pernicity is essentially 50hp and some DI helping 25cha.  The choice is then between the two 75hp Cloaks, but I chose the Iksar Hide one for the 15svD/P.  Exp group wearable svD/P gear is always difficult to come by, and figuring that NO one is camping Chardok these days, the demand will outweigh the supply on these suckers soon --&gt; causing the price to rise (or at least stay level).<br />
<br />
Agree or disagree, at least I have an opinion.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raunstonecutter</div><div class="date">04-30-2003, 08:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Keep the hiero cloak.  I its hard to upgrade at 75hps, and 75hps is hard to get on any slot (tradeable) for under 25k.  Also, when you replace it you can throw it on a twink and its a huge ass instant upgrade =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SamirDaStinky</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 03:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you really want the pernicity one, buy yourself a gold tipped boar horn for cheap (5k-ish on my server), and complete the quest yourself.<br />
<br />
I'd stick with hiero myself. It's what I used for a long time actually until I got a cursed cloak.</div></div><hr />
