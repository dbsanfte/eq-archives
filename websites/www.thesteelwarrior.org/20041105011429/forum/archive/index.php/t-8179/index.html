<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just noticed this while checking loot for named in Sol Ro while I was on a minis raid and realized that this weapon is pretty badass but I'd never heard anything about it, so I'm posting to ask why not? Is there something wrong with it? Extremely rare? Taken out of game? Why isn't this thing more popular?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fenring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Still drops, saw it drop on the way to Dresolik 2 days ago. It's not bad but probably overshadowed because presumably you'd have something better by the time you have Sol Ro access.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Its not a bad sword by any means. Back when we were clearing Sol Ro it just turned out to be extremely rare for us, only one dropping during out entire stint there. I think its a nice weapon for maybe a warrior third or fourth down the tanking list. Typically if youre farming Sol Ro you're capable or soon to be capable of killing Rz so most folks are likely holding out for a shot at a BoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kilzalot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yea this weap is kinda weak for what it takes to get it.  Not talkin really about the mob that drops it... but the effort it takes to get there.  Should have a bit better ratio and around 130-135 HP IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The mobs that drop it are single groupable.  Looking at the other loot from comparable encouners in solro, it seems pretty competitive as is ... if the stats were any better you'd lose balance.<br />
<br />
I've seen it drop about 70% of the time we make a dresolik run ... though it can potentially drop off every named demon on the way up.  I have one in my pack and am not incredibly impressed, but i would rate it above a GSoT for sure.  30ac on it is nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Raunstonecutter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have one.  And unauged, it kind of sucks.  If you don't have many offensive AAs, it kind of sucks.  Any of your basic DW combos will easly out agro this guy for the haul.<br />
<br />
When I added anger2, it got a good bit better, but still not as good as DW<br />
<br />
Got PB2, Fero3, WA4 (now essentially) its not half bad.  I like to use it in groups and don't have trouble with agro.  if I'm SAing or off tanking in a raid, I use it.  With the right AAs it starts to shine.  I'm sure if I spent the points to get it Anger3, and finsihed WA and PB it would be very wicked indeed.  I hope at that point to have a SEWS or BOW or some other kind of agro weapon though.  The 85 hps is really the only draw back.<br />
<br />
Thats just my impression, I've had it since December/January.</div></div><hr />
