<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Evariste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">... sell my WMBS, now that I have a moderately better ratio'd Exe Axe in my hands for MA-ing? The cash I'd get for WMBS would be useful to upgrade a piece or two for my armor, but if it's more effective in general than Exe, I'll keep it around and use Exe as a toy. <br />
<br />
Opinions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Goradain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">For MAing?  I wouldn't use either one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I use the Exe Axe instead of WMBS for DPS.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't use either for MTing (which I assume is what you meant by MAing, because there can be a difference) instead I would grab a GSoT for a few hundred PP (chump change once you sell the WMBS, and should be easily affordable anyway)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I would keep my WMBS just for skilling up faster (my 2HS isn't maxxed, close but not quite), I'm usually the MT and dual-wielding.  Also you can only get maybe 10k for it, that's not going to go very far in getting armor.  But it depends, 10k will go nicely towards a nice upgrade, and the only reason I can think of keeping the WMBS is for skilling up, and if your skill is maxxed there's really no point unless you just prefer faster weapons.  Fab Exec Axe has better ratio, bigger hits, and is cooler looking imo.</div></div><hr />
