******<br />
<br />
Comrades, <br />
<br />
Over the past few weeks of my Crusade for Ultimate Social Justice and The Reappropriation of Froglok Wealth, I have had the fortune to encounter many members of your Cell of Righteous Socialist Rebellion. <br />
<br />
From these encounters, in the lands of the corrupt capitalist-lackey frogloks, known as Sebilis, and in The Repository of Marxist Knowledge I have grown to realise that your members are highly worthy of praise. <br />
<br />
My brethren in the Organisation to Equip Phibs With Mad Lewt (a worthy and highly notable non-profit communist charity) wish to extend our heartfelt regard to your support of our ideals. <br />
<br />
For too long the inhabitants of Norrath have turned a blind eye to the machinations of the bourgeois elite, who strive only to line their own pockets and remove the food from the very mouths of our tads. It gave me the greatest of joys to witness you slaying Trakanon, that foul belligerent whom has misguided my people and their ideologies for decades. <br />
<br />
Whilst reappropriating funds in said Sebilis for the good of all decent, proper communists (for example, purchasing the aforementioned mad lewts from the capitalist swine in the bazzar in order to further our righteous agenda) I realised that your group is in a unique position. <br />
<br />
As your dedication to the destruction of the elite, and the empowering of the proletariat, is without question - I believe that this strength can be put to better use. <br />
<br />
I request of you a small donation of 100,000 platinum pieces to the Organisation to Equip Phibs With Mad Lewt so that I may consolidate the efforts of the masses, create an enlightened marxist state, begin a program of enlightenment and equality among the less fortunate and to purchase a windblade and some heraldic armor. <br />
<br />
Lesser beings than yourselves may regard the above request as a mere ploy; an attempt to garner personal wealth. However, I am sure that you shall all embrace this chance to aid in the creation of the Frogtopia of which we all hold so dear in our hearts. Let it not be thought that I seek wealth, weapons, sexy-ass armor and gear purely for individual gain, but as a giant step towards the realisation of our most cherised ideals. <br />
<br />
Of course, I seek not membership of your organisation; whilst it is worthy of respect, it still maintains the taint of capitalist dogma and the foul mind-spew of the establishment. However through my generous offer you may all donate towards a better tomorrow. Surely you must see that, given such a donation, it could then be invested in my righteous crusade of slaughter and mayhem, brought to the pityful Frogloks of Sebilis (may they be cursed) and, in turn, earn even MORE wealth for the furtherment of Frogtopia. <br />
<br />
I fear that I have gone on too long and taken you from your righteous labours, which you of course share evenly with all others. I must now rest, for tomorrow is another day and I would loathe to believe that my toil would not match that of my comrades as we work towards our ultimate goal. <br />
<br />
Gentlemen: To Frogtopia! <br />
<br />
Yours in ultimate socialist equality, <br />
Phibs McFroak <br />
Paladin of Marr and Reappropriator of Wealth to The Needy.<br />
