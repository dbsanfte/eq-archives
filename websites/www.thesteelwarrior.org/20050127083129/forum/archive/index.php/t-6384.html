I made a new warrior and bought him some gear. I think I've done a decent job of getting the right items but I'd like everyone's advice and suggestions on where I can go from here.<br />
<br />
Here is the link to his magelo: http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=878798<br />
<br />
All the gear, AAs, and leadership abilities are correct. I have about 50k plat. I have some gear sitting in the bank that I've picked up that I could probably sell for another 100k if I really needed to.<br />
<br />
Basically, I'm trying to make sure I haven't missed anything obvious. Any suggestions (about AAs, leadership abilities, or gear) would be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />

Just keep an eye out in the bazaar for even better stuff. You obviously do know what's good and what's crap, so just never stop looking for upgrades and you'll do fine.</div></div><hr />
