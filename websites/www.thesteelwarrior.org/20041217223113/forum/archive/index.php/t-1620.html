What do I do with them now? They're well trained and know to jump when I bark. What you think we can do, what's rough, what should I be doing? Looking for some suggestions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">06-30-2003, 03:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">almost all velious mobs / a lot of luclin mobs / some pop... really do some reasearch</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raunstonecutter</div><div class="date">06-30-2003, 03:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Get a couple groups together, preferably folks who don't mind dying, and romp around looking for targets.<br />
<br />
Two you could do are the Prototypes in PoI Factory, if you have someone flagged, or the Ring of Mujulak.  We've done that ring with as few as 11 people.  Both should be interesting challenges for you guys to figure out.  The loot is pretty good for the events as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slammer</div><div class="date">06-30-2003, 04:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As well try the POI dragon, That should be a fun fight for you as well..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ararkham</div><div class="date">07-01-2003, 04:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Rumblecrush, Servirtor of Luclin is a very good way to stuff your people. Also have a look at Rhag 1 in SSra<br />
<br />
Ararkham</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fvighlander</div><div class="date">07-01-2003, 09:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">With a few more levels (preferably at least 60) on your bard and another tank or two for back-up, you could look into breaking into NToV, or kill Xanamech a few times for nice drops.<br />
<br />
Itraer Vius is an interesting kill, but you'll need a few people to get a copy of RGC if you don't have it already. Which leads to.... Rhags. You should be able to toast Rhag 1 and 2 without breaking a sweat for a chance at RGC scrolls, and AL is fun once you have enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">07-01-2003, 02:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I see a few things you guys need to do to greatly increase your power:<br />
<br />
1. Level - work hard to get everyone 60+. This will do more for you than any drops you could get in a similar amount of time as it would take to get the levels. I would concentrate on your warriors, 2x 56 warriors are not very good back up for you. Same with the bard, need to get the bard leveled up so you can have the better songs.<br />
<br />
2. DPS - you are a little light in the DPS area. 4 rangers are nice if they have EQ+AM3. But you only have 1 monk, 1 rogue, 2x mages, and 2x wizards. I would try to get a few more of these classes.<br />
<br />
3. Knights - you only have 1 of each. While they are not necessary, they do have thier use and they are nice to have around. I would try to add a couple more knights.<br />
<br />
If you could make these changes, then you could basically take any Velious mob and the majority of Luclin mobs. You could also do quite a few PoP bosses as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">07-01-2003, 03:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">PoP<br />
PoI - dragon, factory spiders(after u got keys from killing dragon)<br />
<br />
BoT - wing bosses are one group doable, you might could do the water tower boss(lvl 67) - good shoulders and sword there.<br />
<br />
<br />
luclin<br />
ssra temple - rhrag 1 and 2, 1 triggers 2(3 day spawn)<br />
<br />
akheva - vadyn(1 group doable), maybe IV, worth a shot, you dont NEED rgc if you can 2box = ) but otherwise u do. iv blinds mt and need cure it since he knocks ya back unless u can 2box and watch yourself tank.<br />
<br />
UP - anything named here u can do, doomshade is the hardest mob, rumblecrush is much easier after you get slow in. other mobs are 1 groupable.<br />
<br />
griegs - servitor is easy but i wouldnt bother unless there is nothing else up.<br />
<br />
<br />
velious<br />
velketor's lab- velketor the sorcerer<br />
<br />
kael drakkel - vindicator, tormax, statue. tormax being the hardest. probably need to recruit a cleric or two for tormax, all clerics need work on scm3 asap.<br />
<br />
western waistes<br />
can kill most the dragons here that are sitting, decent neck items, will kill your faction though. maybe can take klandicar too, would be a close fight, but easy ST key<br />
<br />
dragon necropolis<br />
might could do the dragon here too, slowable and ae is resistable.<br />
<br />
loot for all them is listed on allakhazams (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/zonelist.html)<br />
<br />
lvls are the most important though, need to balance your time.</div></div><hr />
