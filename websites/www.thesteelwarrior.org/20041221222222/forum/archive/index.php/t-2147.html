<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kromagnon</div><div class="date">07-23-2003, 01:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I recall a brief discussion on the FoH boards regarding Shielding mods.<br />
<br />
At the time, the Shielding mod was a % of 'post-hit' mitigation, but only functioned on min hit (which, granted, is about 30-40% of the hits you are gonna take from your average mob)<br />
<br />
Has this been changed at all to a straight reduction across all hit values?  Anyone know if it's working as intended with only mitigating min hits?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bunnie Burner</div><div class="date">07-24-2003, 08:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One thing I don't understand...<br />
<br />
is that the minimal hit is a variable in the Hit equations, from what I udnerstood in the &quot;Uber Mob Tanking&quot; thread...<br />
<br />
so if the minimal hit is changed, it will inevitably change all other hits too.<br />
<br />
Say your minimal hit went from 300 to 250...<br />
<br />
well the hit that would of been say... 600<br />
will be 550 instead.<br />
<br />
equation being : Minimal Hit + (Y x Z).. if I recall.. x and z being proper to every mob out there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kromagnon</div><div class="date">07-25-2003, 07:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's not Min Hit + (Y x Z).  It's not Min Hit + anything.<br />
<br />
You will never get hit for the Damage Base.  You get hit for DB + ( n * DI ) where n=1 to 20.  Minimum hit is DB + ( 1 * DI ), bashes/kicks are DB + n where n=1 to SomeNumberLessThanMobDI.<br />
<br />
It's also (the way I understand it) a 'post-hit mitigation', like a rune.  The hit is rolled and calculated and then passed through the post-hit phase for actual damage recieved.<br />
<br />
Mob DB/DI stays unchanged.  But when that mob hits you for a min hit of 1000, you only take 1000-x% damage (where x is your shielding mod).<br />
<br />
The question is:   Does the shielding mod only kick in on minimum hit?  And if that's the case, is it 'broken' or the way it is intended to work?</div></div><hr />

That my friend only Waihung can answer, and i hope its a yes.</div></div><hr />

I look forward to your piercing insights in the future Chatja.<br />
<br />
Thank you for the information Iustus.  I was misinformed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Several other people alraedy agreed on something, you started up a completly new theory with long words, so yes, I did consider that rather amusing :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kromagnon</div><div class="date">07-28-2003, 10:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Take it a bit more serious, please.<br />
As in 'owned'?  I had no idea that was a serious term.<br />
<br />
(the way I understand it)<br />
Meaning I was working on incomplete information.<br />
<br />
Several other people alraedy agreed on something<br />
One person stating a fact is not agreeing.  The fact that it's buried in a thread with a title that has been used 9 THOUSAND times since PoP release is also relevant to people not reading it.<br />
<br />
I'm glad you are amused, just as I was on Saturday while you guys were in Fire.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I concur with Chatja. Not as a mod or anything, just as a guy reading a message board thread, I think you should mellow out.</div></div><hr />
