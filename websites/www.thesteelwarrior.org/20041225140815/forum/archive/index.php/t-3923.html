<br />
I was recently told this from a WAR I respect, but I'm still trying to decifer what this really means.<br />
<br />
<br />
QUOTE:<br />
&quot;The idea is to gear up MTs with 2h weapons so we can survive fights against boss mobs that are now dishing out serious dmg overall <br />
If MTs are duel wielding.. they wont last plain &amp; simple. <br />
Myself for example wont be asking for a BOW now as I have a BBB which does the job its intended to=hold aggro &amp; live longer as a tank&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Firstly, why is it that if MTs are duel wielding, they won't last?  <br />
<br />
And when did BBB become a good agro weapon?  I have *never* seen that thing kick ass in the agro department.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts would be appreciated.<br />

<br />
When one ripostes, it causes spike damage.<br />
<br />
The more times you swing (dual wield) the more chance of a riposte.<br />
<br />
Can't comment on the BBB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lunaticfringesk</div><div class="date">10-29-2003, 06:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My understanding is that riposte damage was not that significant in the grand scheme of things.  However, even if it was, I would think that there is an easy solution.  <br />
<br />
If you had one WAR, with a BoW, and another wielding 2 1H, both with EB proc on them, I would have to think that the DW person would control agro better.  Has practice suggested that this is complete crap?<br />
<br />
Furthermore, I woudl also think that an easy solution to taking less riposte damage would be to firstly click off haste.  Yes, your DPS will go down, but your proc rate per swing will go up and agro management is what we are concerned with here, not DPS (for the MT I am referring to).<br />
<br />
Please tell me what I am missing<br />

Procs are a significant source of aggro for warriors, but they are not the whole picture. Read more here: http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=3789<br />
<br />
As far as riposte goes, it's not a matter of how big a percentage of total damage it is, it's a matter of putting yourself at a much higher risk of taking an extremely bad round that your healing isn't going to be able to deal with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">10-29-2003, 07:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If MTs are duel wielding.. they wont last plain &amp; simple.Quite a few of our warriors duel weild against every mob up to and including Quarm. Your warrior friend is refering to the additiona riposte damage taken from swinging twice as much. While the total additional damage might be insignificant in the grand scheme of things, big ripostes do cause damage spikes which can contribute to being 1 rounded.<br />
<br />
This was much more of a problem 9 months ago when tanks breaking in to the elems where just breaking 9khp. With Time geared tanks over 11k and defensive AAs maxed, the chances of being 1 rounded have been cut to a fraction. It can still happen, but the chances are actually a lot smaller than you would think.<br />
<br />
Myself for example wont be asking for a BOW now as I have a BBB which does the job its intended to=hold aggro &amp; live longer as a tankI would question the intelligence of anyone who would pass on a BoW because they already have a BBB. That would be similar to saying I would pass on a BoC because I already have a Willsapper. The 2 weapons are not even in the same class, not even close.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh, Ive read that thread alright Gimmel.  :) <br />
<br />
And I agree that reducing the amount if swings should equate to a reduction in the amount of hate generated.  I would question, however, that it would reduce the amount of hate *significantly*.<br />
<br />
I merely posted that as a possible solution to this riposte problem.  What I am now reading, however, is that it isn't a huge deal nowadays, which is in accordance with my expectations and experience.  In other words, put haste back on for max agro and DPS.<br />

I use it for tanking in the EP's and its great agro.</div></div><hr />
