I remember a post talking about class DPS, where parses were done in unbuffed max atk type scenario, and VDD was like 110ish, so that chart is either self hasted, or inaccurate.  Also the ppm is wrong considering gs4w is like a 30 mod or such, so that questions the parsing</div></div><hr />

Full AA , Full ATK , 41% haste parsed sews/bow around 110ish on Katta Banker.</div></div><hr />

don't know.<br />
<br />
So, take it with a grain of salt... even so, the comparisons should be somewhat useful. As long as the parses were all done with the same AA and buffs, on the same mob etc, in other words if everything else was equal the relative DPS should be about the same.<br />
<br />
Plus, there's sample size too... but a quick eyeball shows them to be relatively accurate.</div></div><hr />

DPS can also depend on WHAT mob you're fighting, and from what side, so I don't think that that necessarily means the parse is invalid. As I said, as long as the only thing that changed is weapon to weapon, the relative change should be the same.<br />
<br />
as for PPM, yup. Think the creator of that table should correct it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Crashbomba</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">thanks for the fast replies all.   :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">hey this is really awesome link<br />
as you said parsing depens on a lot of things so when I compare stuff I look at ratios the lower it is the better the dps in most of the cases.</div></div><hr />
