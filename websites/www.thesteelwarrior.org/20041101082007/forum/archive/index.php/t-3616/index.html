<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Gonna be wearing my new Crimson Runed Mask (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=26773) for a long time.  <br />
<br />
Was thinking Veng 4 might be the way to go with it.  Anything else that would be better?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Splaktar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I was going to say that you might want to look at HP or AC.  But then I saw that in your magelo you aren't even close to the ATK cap (which could be a problem for a lot of people).  Shrug either should work I guess.  Still think I'd go with AC/HP over ATK tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Haven't really seen a +hp augment that is slot 7 and goes in the face slot.  I could put a +10 ac augment in it (60 ac mask wuwu) and it would be much cheaper than veng4.  Maybe that's the way to go.  I understand with elemental armor it's relatively easy to hit the atk cap?  This mask is pretty much the only +atk item I have right now but I am trying to pick my loot in VT with stuff that isn't as easily replaced in the e-planes.<br />
<br />
Anybody else have any thoughts on that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brudal the Fat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You have +12hp augs in normal adventures, common drop not named and you have +15hp augs from the hard adventures as well.<br />
<br />
Both pretty rare granted but I am gonna wait for one of those to put on my mask personally. HP imo is &gt; all those but everyone has their own prefference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Splaktar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeah, I was thinking the 10 AC aug for 510 points, from MM I beleive.<br />
<br />
ATK cap isn't a problem till Raex you are right.  Once you get AoV, AoB, AoD on half your items you are basically at the cap.  Avatar apparently is included in this cap.  One of our guild wars atm procs avatar and it gives him no ATK at all heh.  I'm not sure what the cap is, 200 ish?<br />
<br />
The 50 HP aug from MM raid fits on masks, I thought there was a 40 hp one for masks.  Or at least a 30 hp aug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Myst Darkwind</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have AC aug on my mask as well. Im doing AC on MASK Belt and BACK, HP on the other slots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Chatja ogre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">AC, grats on mask.</div></div><hr />
