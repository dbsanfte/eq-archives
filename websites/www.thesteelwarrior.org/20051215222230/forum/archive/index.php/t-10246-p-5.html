------------------------------------ <br />
<br />
Welcome to the forums. I know there is a lot of various discussions and questions going around today so I am hoping to consolidate them somewhat. <br />
<br />
Class questions/suggestions <br />
Regarding class balance issues, we have asked the dev team to look further into the following. Please be aware that any proposed changes take time to occur, which is why the discussions have been so many, and the feedback not as many. <br />
<br />
Hit/miss ratio concerns - Some players say they miss all the time. Some players say they miss in succession some of the time. We are trying to determine what exactly the problem is. Please remember, unless your weapon skill is maxed out for your current level, misses will be an issue. We are investigating why players who are maxed out on weapon skill are still missing. <br />
<br />
Warriors - We are aware of many players who say the warrior is lacking utility. We picked out the most well-developed thoughts on this matter from the player base and have presented them to the dev team for their analysis. <br />
<br />
Warlocks - As with the Warrior class, the most well-developed concerns regarding the Warlock class have been made aware of the dev team. <br />
<br />
If you have questions outside of these 4 points (this is the extent of info we have right now, but that might change through the course of the day), please feel free to ask them here. <br />
<br />
[Language mod] <br />
We have brought up this issue, but it must first be investigated. <br />
<br />
[Realm/Login] <br />
All levels of the organization are working to address this. I would like to stress that real progress is being made on the issue behind the scenes, and again, we are all fans of the game and want as much to rid of these problems as much as our players. I know the perception is contrary to that, but there aren't enough words to express how much dedication, from the president on down, is going into resolving these issues. <br />
<br />
[Mage] <br />
Water - I will ask for some feedback, not sure why there wouldn't be higher end water. <br />
Arcane Missle - I believe QA is still looking into this matter. <br />
<br />
[Character migration] <br />
We plan to offer a 1 time migration from high population realms to low peopulation realms to ease the overcrowding. It is currently undergoing implementation/testing. More details to follow.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But I happen to do a bit of goblin toy work *uses rocket boots and gets away, so long as they dont explode*<br />
<br />
(sidenote: I think I'll make a small thread to help warriors deal with warlocks since I have personal experiance from my side... all I can say for now is blacksmith trinkets!)<br />
<br />
/derail off :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then I hit lvl 30 and it was all over.  Once you get berserk its over.  If you are in Fury stance, you can break their fear with berserk.  That and they can't cast it on you again for a bit allows you to intercept back and finish them off.  With reckless or the glimmering mithril trinket, they can't really do much to you anymore.<br />
<br />
Oh did you know that their pet can charm you if you are a male character?  It doesn't work on female players though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Get cosmos with its /equip and /unequip commands and macro them.  Works MUCH better than trying to use your mouse.<br />
<br />
Hmmm, not right now it aint.  If that really were the case there would be a forced cooldown between stance changes.  Instead we have this notion that you can change stances instantly, but it makes you completly 100% calm.  Uhhh.. yea.. right.. sure.<br />
<br />
And I really dont see any reason we should loose it all for changing the way we stand.<br />
<br />
I can understand that they might want us to pick a stance and use it.  If they really meant it, there would be a cooldown after you switched.  Instead we have this talent point sink called Tatical Mastery.  Its annoying, but hey, its one fun ass game.  I'll play it either way =)<br />
<br />
huh? How is that?<br />
<br />
<br />
Totally agree. And for the record, CRIT is one of our best friends in PVP and PVE even. Not to mention it activates a couple of our most useful skills? Ever hear of Flurry or Deep Wounds?</div></div><hr />
