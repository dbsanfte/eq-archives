(That will quad every time for 1100 every single round)<br />
<br />
Most have 700-3000 hit.  With a decent average and deadly spikes.<br />
But the average hit, is closer to the &quot;average of min/max dmg&quot;<br />
<br />
At least thats the feeling i have gotten after 5 months in the elemental.<br />
Mobs can hit HARD, but they rarely do so.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, she hit me for 2420 (iirc is her max hit, Im at work now) exactly 2 times in 33 minutes of tanking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">05-06-2003, 02:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I see your point Solinar. Rather than give mobs uber ATK ratings like they did in Velious, their ATK is rather low - such that it can be overcome by AC. The compensated by giving them a much larger max/min hit.<br />
<br />
The net result is the same though, there is still a &quot;soft cap&quot;, but in the case of PoP mobs this cap is determined why the level of AC required to get avg hit down to a reasonable level.</div></div><hr />

Mob dps didnt change much ...<br />
(Anyone else remember 900dps AoW , and 900dps Fenin atm ?)<br />
<br />
The max hit made spikes VERY deadly.<br />
And they found a way to make AC actually matter (thumbs up on that one)</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. As always, terrific work Han!<br />
<br />
2. You definitely have enough swings to generate a level of statistical confidence. It might not be the &quot;truth&quot;, but you have enough data to estimate the level of certainty with which you can say what you are saying.<br />
<br />
3. I'm a little concerned about the use of average hit, rather than dps. As Solinar points out elsewhere (and for another issue), the frequency of hits has a bigger impact on damage absorbed than size of hits. If there's any way to recover dps absorbed data for the time spent with the different AC levels, I think that would be much more significant. <br />
<br />
Unless we know for certain that high AC can not mitigate hits into misses. Is a hit always a hit, no matter what your AC -- does AC only impact the range of x? If AC only impacts the range of x, then the average hit measure seems okay. What frequency are the mobs hitting you at those AC levels? My hazy recollection is that gear only gets you mitigation AC, which does not include avoidance, which means hits are not converted into misses by getting better gear, which means, in this instance, higher AC does not mean more misses, which means everything I'm saying can be ignored?<br />
<br />
Or maybe I've been out of EQ long enough I've lost track of all of this stuff. It's been 2-3 months since I logged in, so sorry if this is old news or doesn't make sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solinar</div><div class="date">05-27-2003, 11:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">hit % appears to be based soley on level ratio.  Every 65 mob appears to hit every 63 warrior about the same % of hits/swings with maxxed defensive skills and AA (CA/LR) non-wistanding.  At least thats been my experience.<br />
<br />
I also think someone did a pretty significant proof of the hit-cant-be-mitigated-to-a-miss issue on the old boards, but I have no clue where that would be now, or how they proved it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tugurok</div><div class="date">05-29-2003, 10:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think this thread should be stickied and used as the starting point for future AC tests of various sorts.<br />

*bump again*<br />
<br />
Let's sticky this, or I'll just copy and paste it into the ubermob tanking thread. Hate to lose this stuff.</div></div><hr />

pop currently 1280 unbuffed but giving away 150hp or should i drop back to 1250 to get those hp back?<br />
have a few equipment changes comming up and just wanted to know if i should still concentrate on ac?<br />
just ball park fine without getting to deep thanks.</div></div><hr />

It really depends on what you are tanking. The new AC theory only applies to PoP era mobs so if you are still tanking Velious or SoL bosses, then stick with the 1200ac softcap and go for HP.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, if you are going to be tanking tier 3+ bosses then you should be aiming for 2k+ AC. The nice part about the gear that will get you that much AC is that it also has a ton of HP on it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It was proven on the old boards.<br />
<br />
How to prove it:<br />
<br />
<br />
Find a static level mob, duck to avoid parry/riposte, and let it beat on you fully clothed.  Record the number of misses.<br />
<br />
Get your AGI to whatever it is while you're fully geared (you're gonna need a shaman) then on that same static level mob, duck to avoid parry/riposte, and let it beat on you naked.  Record the number of misses.<br />
<br />
They should be ~ identical if your sample is large enough.<br />
<br />
edit: forgot to add you have to take out all the successful dodges from both sample sets</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">maths</div><div class="date">06-22-2003, 04:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1694 AC (Unbuffed) = 329.4 Average &quot;hit&quot;<br />
1815 AC (Unbuffed) = 311.7 Average &quot;hit&quot;<br />
1917 AC (Unbuffed) = 295.0 Average &quot;hit&quot;<br />
2112 AC ( Buffed ) = 288.6 Average &quot;hit&quot;<br />
<br />
Just for reference:<br />
1694 AC = 666 hits, 219374 total damage from hits<br />
1815 AC = 813 hits, 253380 total damage from hits<br />
1917 AC = 507 hits, 149544 total damage from hits<br />
2112 AC = 752 hits, 217004 total damage from hits <br />
<br />
Usually when you do this kind of study you want to estimate the errors. As an example it would be nice to know; if I were to repeat the 1815 AC test with 813 hits, can I expect the average hit to be 311.7 again? As you probably already know, the answer to this question is no. What I would like to be able to say is; with 1815 AC the average hit for this particular mob is 312 +- some number, with some degree of confidence.<br />
<br />
Since you didn't post the standard deviation for your samples I can't give you exact confidence intervals for the real average hits but I can still make a rough estimation. <br />
<br />
The error is porportional to the standard deviation and inversly proportional to the square root of number of observations. So we have:<br />
REAL AVG HIT = MEASURED AVG HIT +/- k*STD_DEV/sqrt(n)<br />
 <br />
where k is a constant from the students distribution with some degree of confidence (k=2 corresponds to ~95% confidence) and n is the number of observations.  <br />
<br />
We already have the number of observations and the measured avg hit so we only need to make a rough estimation of the standard deviation. I don't have any logs from sol ro but I found some 1200 hits from a soldier of fire in my logs. The standard deviation for that set was 194 which I will round to 200. Now assuming the sentry in sol ro have the same Max and Min hit (733, 173) as a soldier of fire in PoF we can use 200 as an aproximation of the standard deviation to get an idea of the statistical uncertainty in your test.<br />
<br />
For the 1815 AC test:<br />
REAL AVG DMG = 312 +/- 2*(200)/sqrt(813) = 312 +/- 14<br />
<br />
and this I can say with 95% confidence if I neglect the fact that the standard deviation might be somewhat off. <br />
<br />
Note: a good estimation of the standard deviation is (Max-Min)/2.. this will always be an overestimation of the error and in our case it would lead us to the conclusion: real avg dmg = 312 +- 20 with more than 95% confidence.<br />
<br />
Note II: As you can see the only way to lower the error is to increase the number of observations since the error is inversly porportional to the sqrt of number of observations. With 3,000 observations our error would decrease to +-7 and with 10,000 observations the error would be down to +-4.</div></div><hr />
