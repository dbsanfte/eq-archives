<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tatanka7th</div><div class="date">01-14-2004, 01:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just out of curiosity, why are you disgusted with the TM camp for the Katta cloak?  It's on my list for things to do for my warrior, so I'm curious to hear your opinion.<br />
<br />
I help my guildleader do the quest (he bought the ashes in the Bazaar for some stupidly low price, lucky dog), so we only had to do everything else up to the TM camp.  Took about 2 hours, and was just the two of us (62 DRU, 62 SK).  Total cake.  So obviously the camp in TM is the only bottleneck for this.<br />

<br />
I spent a combined 85 hours with my friend (50 myself, 35 him) before I got the ashes.  Suck it up and keep at it.  You won't regret it.</div></div><hr />

loyalist shield of honor, Katta quest. 50ac 75hp, good until Time. <br />
well, this post gives me new energy to spend time at that accursed castle.  then again, i'm sure i spent more time on the ethereal bladed naginata quest, and that certainly didn't last me too long.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telen</div><div class="date">01-14-2004, 04:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What level do you need to be to do the loyalist shield quest?  I'm level 50 and normally play with three other level 50ish players, cleric, ench, shm.  Although Allakhazams says level 50, I am thinking we need to be higher than 50 to do this quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bombay</div><div class="date">01-14-2004, 04:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">pretty sure vald is 62.  might be tough to take him out with a group of 50's...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">icsdave</div><div class="date">01-14-2004, 07:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not only is he 62 but he has 1000hp life tap and can only be hit with bane weapons, so NO a 50's group could not take him :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">01-14-2004, 08:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Unless they've changed him recently ... he doesn't summon.<br />
<br />
A Druid could kite him (and I believe has in the past).<br />
<br />
Also, vamp bane weapons are pretty easy to get. Some powder from Netherbian Lair, a short trip to Katta, and boom, you've got yourself a 1hb to hit him with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bombay</div><div class="date">01-15-2004, 02:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">heh, got lucky and nabbed him tonite.  thank you logolam of &lt;Peritus&gt; for the heads up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anker steadfast</div><div class="date">01-16-2004, 09:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh ... he don't summon ?<br />
<br />
Necro + Shaman = Root 'n' Rot<br />
<br />
Would that work ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aurthur</div><div class="date">01-16-2004, 10:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">He is immune to changes in run speed.  I've seen 65 necro/clerics attempt to duo him using the necro's pet as the tank and fail...simply too many hp.  Solo'ing him with a druid would be...interesting...and the chances of you resisting *every* snare he ever cast as you were slowly kiting him and trying to regen mana would be a crapshoot.<br />
<br />
I've spent about...25 total hours clearing that castle and the only time I seem to see that vampire is when other folks are killing him when I arrive.  :-/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">01-16-2004, 12:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've read about a few high end necros soloing Valdanov, but it's no easy feat.  He is undead and doesn't summon, however, so you can kite him around and cook him all you want.  The only problem is he'll gate!  <br />
<br />
Also, you can buy shitty Vampyre Bane in Katta.  They're 12/23  piercers, but they hit him.  They're in the third bag of my inventory.  I always keep a set on me. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grongl</div><div class="date">01-17-2004, 09:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Taking a quick peek at your guild's site, there's an obvious answer that screamed out at me.  Cloak of Thorns (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=31366) from Lady Nev in NToV.  I wore mine for a loooooooooooong time, and you will be hard pressed to find a better one in that tier of raiding.  Instaclick DS, 35ac 100hp (45ac with an aug), solid secondary stats, and for most guilds, given to Wars first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goradain</div><div class="date">01-21-2004, 10:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did the entire quest for the Loyalist Shield about a year ago and have yet to see HG or Valdanov up ever.  To be honest, your better off grinding in LDoN and buying the cloak there.  The Loyalist Shield is simply not worth the time anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gharghael</div><div class="date">01-23-2004, 09:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I helped a friend kill Valdanov several months ago. We had two warriors, a druid, a cleric, a necro, and a monk; all around 60 except myself being 55ish IIRC. We melees all had the crappy 1hb vampyre bane weapons. It was sort of a long fight, the other warrior was slain, and I had to tank him for the last quarter of the fight. His lifetap sucks. =- |<br />
<br />
I've wanted that cloak bad since then - It just seems like such a PITA to find Valdanov up.</div></div><hr />
