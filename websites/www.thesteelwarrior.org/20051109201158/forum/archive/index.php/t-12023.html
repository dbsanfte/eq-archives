Priest bubbled me during the last run and I think I yelled at her (team speak). We still won the battle, but I felt kind of bad at getting hot for being bubbled. Afterwards we started to talk about it. She said she had read on the priest boards conflicting info on if it’s okay to bubble a warrior. I'd still rather err on the side of caution and stick with not wanting the bubble, but there may be times when it’s acceptable I'm unaware of. What do you guys think?</div></div><hr />

Okay, I'm a jerk /chuckle. So is there an agro issue here with regard to agro being transferred to caster or reduction of hate generation due to being bubbled?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Isk</div><div class="date">06-20-2005, 10:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the latter</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greysen</div><div class="date">06-20-2005, 01:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My tests show that since about 2 patches ago, being bubbled no longer generates rage while taking damage.  This really isn't a big deal, because it amounts to about 10 rage (900 damage).  Chain shielding might be a problem.<br />
<br />
Priests should defintely use it to &quot;heal around&quot; mortal strike, and other healing impairing effects (veil of shadow comes to mind) if possible.  Pre-shielding is good, as with mana regen, it is typically a &quot;free&quot; 900 hp.  The only real time I run into a problem with it is if someone shields me immediately upon me getting aggro, it'll typically pull them if I haven't got a chance to hit anything yet.</div></div><hr />

I don't think I've had problems keeping aggro, I've had to convince people I'm not prot specced.  But I'll keep a closer eye, and tell them to bubble someone else (themselves, mage) if it's going to be a tough fight.</div></div><hr />

However, when I get low on HPs against hard hitting mobs, sometimes it is eassier for a priest to bubble then heal, and I will usually have pletny of rage built up by then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greysen</div><div class="date">06-21-2005, 08:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There seems to be a lot of conflicting results on the WoW forums as to whenever this topic is posted.  I usually end up posting mine, and get a big &quot;Stfu n00b, it does generate rage&quot; when in fact it doesn't for me.  If anyone can test/post their results as well it would be nice.</div></div><hr />

As soon as it went awya I strated getting rage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm of the same conviction. I prefer not to be shielded at engage during 5-man instances. I could care less when tanking MC, Onyxia, etc.  As rage is not hard to come by.<br />
<br />
When shielded you don't generate rage from damage taken, but you still generate it from damage dealt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">andrewquik</div><div class="date">06-21-2005, 11:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yo, in my experience healing in instances, the bubble does deter rage building up at start of fight, unless the warrior charges.<br />
<br />
personally, i view the bubble as a &quot;stop the bleeding&quot; measure, usually when i'm waiting for mana to regen so i can actually heal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">06-21-2005, 12:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had to actually read this entire thread to understand what the fuck &quot;Bubbled&quot; means, and can't believe you guys all use a term so blatently fairy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sthythys</div><div class="date">06-21-2005, 03:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">While it may slow your rage generation a tad, having a priest shield you before initiating combat makes it so he doesn't have to heal you as soon as he otherwise would have to...resulting in less aggro to the priest!<br />
<br />
Not a huge difference but then again as was stated above the rage lost is like 10 points and is also hardly a huge deal, especially since you are still getting rage from dealing damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Viernafein</div><div class="date">06-22-2005, 01:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are certain times I actually have fun and count on taking a ton of damage for huge spikes in my rage bar (Onyxia's Warders for example) for getting a ton of rage to spam off every ability I can think of, then jump back out for a bandaid.<br />
<br />
Bubbles frustrate me to no end during such scenarios</div></div><hr />
