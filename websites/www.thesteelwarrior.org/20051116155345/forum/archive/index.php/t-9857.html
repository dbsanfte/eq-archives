You don't mean gleam do you? A periodic gleam/sparkle from the blade, like it caught the sun?  If so, that simply means the weapon has been sharpened, most likely by smithing made sharpening stones.  You can also get a glowing affect on your weapon by having it enchanted.  I really like the fact that player modifications to weapons, even temporary ones, can be seen.</div></div><hr />

the red glow is the beast enchant(+2 dmg vs beasts).  Relatively low skill required in enchanting to do, but the recipe itself is only dropped.  Look on the AH and you can normally pick it up cheap.   The +1 damage enchant doesn't make the sword glow any longer.</div></div><hr />

Serious? <br />

That's pretty bad ass, might have to get that on a weapon later on =p</div></div><hr />

I apply Coarse Sharpening Stone which increases sharp weapon damage by 3 for 30 minutes.   You need 65 smithing to make the stone.  My smithing is only at 88 at the moment.

actually, do both.  Red gleam is an enchantment (permanent), sharpening stones are a buff (temporary).  Use them both and even at low levels you can have +3 dmg on every swing.</div></div><hr />
