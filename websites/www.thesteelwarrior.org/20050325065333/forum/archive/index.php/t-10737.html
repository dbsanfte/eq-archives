We normally do with 2 groups in each, but wanted to know if anyone knew the bare min. Those dang roots suck to move a raid around in though. Thanks for any response.</div></div><hr />

The loot was easy though.  &gt;&lt;</div></div><hr />

I might be mis-remembering and it might be 6, but it's definitely one or the other :)  people with sufficient numbers to put 2 groups in each room are just unjust, that's all.</div></div><hr />

I agree, Prathun did very well on this one....Nice lil gnome too I have seen him once or twice on our server.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">02-23-2005, 10:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not saying Inktu`ta is a bad zone, but I guess it's not the kind of game play I look forward to in EverQuest.  I honestly enjoyed Uqua, LLLOOOVVEED the Rallos Zek event in Tactics, adore the King/Queen scripts, and kill for just about anything that fits the definition of pure, adrenaline rushing brutality.  Another reason I don't particularly care for Inktu`ta so much is because it incorporates two things in this game that I absolutely despite - deathtouch and banish.  Kelekdrix would be a lot more fun for me if he was a 2000dps mob instead of a weak panzy who just banishes your tank whenever he feels like it.  Deathtouch is just gay, even if the form they use it in makes sense.  It always has been and it always will be.  It's just cheap, and I honestly care nothing for it.<br />
<br />
So ya, Inktu`ta definitely doesn't rank up there as one of my more favorite zones, but then again, who likes Uqua anyways?  (That'd be me...)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kleth</div><div class="date">02-24-2005, 01:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe fun for you, but think about the cleric that is CH chaining you all that time. Inktu'ta allowed for tanking fun, clerics having fun and generally everyone doing something, which is what a raid should be imo. But it is just that, my opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tramir</div><div class="date">02-24-2005, 01:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've loved every GoD raid encounter that we've come across. I really enjoy the fact that these raids were developed in such a way that everyone could contribute, and everyone had to pay attention on an individual level. It wasn't all about pinning Raid_Mob_01 into the nearest corner, and then DPSing it to death. Having said this, our guild just broke into Tacvi tonight, and we said hello to the goat, and then killed her....and then proceded to wipe to the adds. &gt;.&lt; Good times.</div></div><hr />

There was so much thought put into Inktu'ta.  I won't give anything away, but the name of Cursecaller F..... had me laughing so hard I almost forgot to turn attack on.  Gotta respect a zone that makes you laugh.</div></div><hr />

Oh nos, the guild has wiped, *again*<br />

DONE!  (often said from bind point...)</div></div><hr />
