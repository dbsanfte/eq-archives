<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I found this info and got this drop the other day so I thought I would share it as I think this is a good aggro proc and a good alternative to doing lots of LDoN's for an Ykesa proc.<br />
<br />
In Bloodfields there is a mob called an ukun slaughterhound that is a PH for the Domineering Ukun.  The uncommon drop off the Domineering Ukun is a stone called a Bloodstone of Agony.  It is a type 4 aug with a Bite of Ykesha proc, which is a 50 dmg 0 sec stun proc.  Not quite as good as the LDoN versions, but close and should have the same aggro.  The common drop is an ok cloak.  We got 3 cloaks before getting the aug, I would say we probably spent four or five hours before getting the aug.<br />
<br />
To get to the mob from the DS zone in just run to the first open courtyard and just past the archway there is the first open area.  In the first open area will be the wandering ukun slaugtherhound, he will wander across both sides of the path.  Just keep pulling him until the named Domineering pops, probably about 1 in 4-5 or so.<br />
<br />
There is one other named in the general area, the Ikaav Slumberer, and the miragenist is the PH for it.  So you can pull both of those, the Ikaav Slumberer drops a decent clr/dru/shm belt as the common and a nice +2 dmg shield aug as the uncommon.  During the four to five hours there we also got the +2 dmg shield aug as well as the bite of ykesha proc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>unclebong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">very cool! Thanks for the info  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>bargran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">nice info. Just 2 questions :<br />
Do nameds drop some sorts of runes, and if so, which ones ?<br />
Difficulty ? think it shouldn't be hard, but never hunted in bloodfield other than our epic fight :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lexchess</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Just saved me 510 adv points!  Got one tonight.  Great info!!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Great, good to hear.   :)   I thought it was a good alternative to spending 500 adventure points also.<br />
<br />
The mobs are pretty easy there, they are mostly under level 55 as they aren't immune to stun procs.  Named are a little bit harder, but still pretty easy.  You can check my magelo, I'm 65 with just over 20 aa's, decently equipped.  I would guess you could handle tanking the named much lower level.<br />
<br />
I don't think any of the named in Bloodfields drop runes.   :(   At least the lower level ones and the one that drops the aug doesn't.  Bloodfields isn't a spectacular zone, but the ykesha aug is a nice drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Drunder50</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Anyone know if that proc will work on mobs above 65?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Depends on what you mean by work...  Will it stun them?  No - none of the Ykesha procs go above lvl55 stun.  Will still it generate good aggro?  Yep.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Drunder50</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Exactly what I was looking for.. Thanks..<br />
<br />
Got the aug over the weekend. Camped just outside the first archway leaving the castle on the right. Got it on the second kill. Was there maybe 1.5 hours..</div></div><hr />
