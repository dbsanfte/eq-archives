Most *I* have personally seen, or know of 100% certain is 550k my friend farmed in Droga over 2 week long breaks we had in Feb-March and sold to Yantis.  Got himself some cool tech toys from it</div></div><hr />

The individual players with the most $$ are the ones who farm shit like tactics/bot towers.  In fact, for many, this is their full time job that makes the house and car payment.  Of course you gotta be thinking. WTF Tactics and BoT???  The fact that they do it non-stop while cockblocking everyone else, makes it quite effective.  I know several people who make in the 40,000(US dollars) a year.  This buisiness is quite the racketeering operation.  You find out who buys your stuff, as generally, it will be someone who purchased plat from Yantis/Ebay/PA.  You then offer to sell them your plat for a discounted price to what the former 3 sell theirs for.  Then, they turn around and buy items off of you, after all - you'll want to give your &quot;special customers&quot; at least a 10percent price break!   And of course.. you sell the plat to them again, and the cycle continues.</div></div><hr />

I believe he was his guilds merchant, he used to sell stuff like looting rights to the vindi bp back when it was very high level content. He had so much cash if someone cast lev on him he would die due to the falling damage when it faded. This is all ec trading btw.</div></div><hr />

There are hidden dangers to being rich, though.<br />
One day we took our baby alts into Splitpaw and after we fought for a while he realized he wasn't wearing any pants (&quot;Hmm. Must have sold them...&quot;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are at least 2 perma-traders on E'ci who always have an abundance of bigger ticket items for sale than me.  No idea how much liquid cash they keep.<br />
<br />
Honestly, I'd be shocked if I were even in the top 10 for cash on my server.  It's just way too easy to farm expensive drops right now and friggin' EVERYTHING sells for 100k+ on E'ci.  I constantly see people say on the boards that &quot;such and such item should cost you about 30k&quot; yet I know that item sells for well over 100k on E'ci.  Our economy is really screwed up.</div></div><hr />

I have 5 level 65, 1 61, and a bunch of other, all with lots of goodies.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sam DeathWalker</div><div class="date">09-22-2004, 12:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Iv spent about 3 million pp on my guys, with half of that on the warrior, and I have just about 1 million pp on my trader right now. 6 level 66 and 1 level 65. I have 7 of the 100K horses... BoC was 250K. <br />
<br />
Im getting an average of 4 OoW Level 66 Items/runes a day (sell for at least 80K but Iv only sold 4 or so items (122K each for 2 the first night and one for 155K and one for 77K) so far.... <br />
<br />
Yantis prices for items are insane I laugh when I see them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get yur very own War Marshalls Blade 4 a mere $50&quot; or whatever LolzorS!<br />
<br />
I bet a lot of people would pay $50 for a level 68 rune right now ... <br />
<br />
Dang when you think about it, 4 drops a day at $50 a drop.... humm <br />
<br />
Better get off the forums and log back in.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's gotta be overcompensation for something.<br />
<br />
I've never had over 300k at one time... when it gets to that point, I start giving it away to friends, giving away or selling cheaply, high plat items to friends and guildies. PP just doesn't mean anything once you raid for NODROP items that are better than anything buyable, and replace all your buyable items. Unless, of course, you like to twink.<br />
<br />
If I hadn't given away all that plat, I'd probably be at, oh, a mill by now, as a player with a very casual interest in making any money at all. Instead, I'm hangin around 150k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wudedorm</div><div class="date">09-22-2004, 02:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i have a friend who last I asked had about 5 million plat, myself I think I got 50k lol last thing I bought other than invis potions was some spells for my bot cleric 3-4 months ago money is almost worthless once EP+ imo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frawdo</div><div class="date">09-23-2004, 02:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Most I've ever had was 70k one time when I got a nice droppable FT item and sold it.<br />
<br />
One guy in my guild had 2 million pp during PoP, think he has about 1 million right now. One other person from my guild had 1.5million during PoP, but he spent most of his money trying to get 1750 for tradeskills. Made it to 1720 and quit the game completely.<br />
<br />
I've heard of people having billions of plat due to bugs, but I really doubt anyone has ever had 1,000,000,000 pp legimately. Just seems like too much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sintaril</div><div class="date">09-23-2004, 03:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">im pretty sure the monk you were thinking of was tigerstyle from quellious. we used to hang out alot a few years back. last i heard, when he ebayed, he had ~8 mil in cash, and ~3 more in items. basicly he was the servers top trader from  mid/late kunark (iirc) till early/mid luclin when he decided to become a raider, and later quit. not sure what the new owner did for sure, but pretty sure hes a pp for $ trader now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tsaevio</div><div class="date">09-23-2004, 12:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">fv is where the real plat is at :)  i think i got up to 7 or 8 mil at one point, but that's nothing really.....there are many people with multiple millions at any given time, and the main traders have MUCH more.</div></div><hr />
