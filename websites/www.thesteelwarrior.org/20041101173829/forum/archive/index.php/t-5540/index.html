<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>wickedwoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have some serious upgrading to do, starting with haste, since I'm only at 21% with the Belt of Contention. I doubt that I'm going to be looting a better haste item anytime soon so I'm considering selling my cobalt bracer and buying the haste upgrade since I'm a woodelf and don't really need the shrink.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions for which haste item I should pursue? Cloak of Flames seems like a good choice, though I did just recently get my Cloak of Greater Pernicity and would hate to give it up ...<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for the advice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">if you can swing a CoF than go for it; you can make up the HP and AC loss with a new belt like a heavy rubi girdle or a deity_imbued one as well ( if you worship RZ that is ) or something.<br />
<br />
cobalt wrist for a wood elf is kinda silly; but either whith the bracer or a CoF you're going to get your investment $$$ back later on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">soulscream should set you at max excep for shammy haste not a bad belt either, and prolly leave you cash to get a new bracer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wychway</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Weeeeelllll.... That shrinky isn't exactly useless. I'm an inky and mine comes out regularly. Usually for shrinking others. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I play a dwarf and I still regret selling my cobalt bracer. Not only for when you need to corner a mob, but for shrinking others.<br />
<br />
Save your plats and do a lot of LDoN dungeons. Save your plats and your points for either a CoF+heavy rubicite girdle or either LDoN helm or cloak+rubi girdle. Either way you should be set for a long time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wompem Ondahed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I will keep mine until they have an easy quested shrink item with uber stats, so basically I will own mine till EQ explodes and SOE founders commit Hari Kari (sp?)<br />
<br />
I have a WE illusion crown, but there are still plenty of times when I illusion plus shrink and then I can corner tank something previously unable to. Plus, ever get tired of the troll shaman on a drogmor? Screw that, give them their own medicine with your shrink. I use mine to piss off shaman and various casters, as well as shrinking other melee so then rogue can get closer to the mobs rear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dununder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I would say keep the Cobalt bracer, since its just such a useful item. Of course being an Ogre its in constant use, but I also use it to shrink group members in tight places, especially LDoNs. However, if you can live without it, I would say to buy a Soulscream belt. Less Haste than a CoF, but far more common and cheaper.<br />
<br />
And look me up online. I have something for you that may work a tad better than that Architect Scepter.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zynth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">soulscream belt is very cheap (compared to other haste items at the 30% range) and very easy to camp, as well as having stats that benifit a warrior or tank. usually i see them for around 25k. for the price of a CoF, you can get soulscream belt and cloak of greater pernicity...twice. CoGP has the same raw hp as CoF with better stats and the SSB has 5% less haste. personally i dont see 5% haste being worth an extra 40-50k. <br />
as far as other gear, after checking yur magelo, i'd say you should focus more on gear with stamina and raw hp on them above all else. if i were in your position, i'd look to getting better earrings and leggings right away and probably a better mask if you can find a decent one. the rest of your stuff isnt that bad, could be better, could be worse. it should keep you stable until you can upgrade them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I miss my cobalt bracer very much since I haven't been able to aqquire one since I swapped servers.  Also I remember a guild warrior back on TM that sold his cobalt bracer and believe me I swore at him every time he asked me for shrink on raids from that day forward.<br />
<br />
I have never been a fan of selling a piece of gear that you use to buy another piece of gear.  I would agree with Wandor and say keep the bracer and save for the haste item.  There are shrink devices relatively cheap in the bazaar these days, and I get by ok with them, but anyone that's owned a cobalt bracer will tell ya it's not the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Binnamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I have a bracer, and I love it. Save for the 5 requests an hour I get for shrinks. It was definitly the 13k I spent on it.<br />
<br />
I pity the fool who has to use a shrink device! I'm a dwarf btw, and I use it every raid. It's hard to corner tank unless you are the smallest you can possibly be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">It really depends where you want to take your character.  Cobalt bracers fetch a good price because they have always been a pita to get and are very nice to have when you start raiding - shrink yourself for cornering, shrink that fat paladin who always stands infront of you when you are trying to get to a mob.<br />
<br />
I finally found a cobalt bracer forsale after 3 months of bazaar searching, /auct wtb-ing and posting on my servers pawn shop forum.  Cost me 25k and worth every penny, and thats as a half elf.  I was going through a class 6 mana battery every 2-3 days just keeping myself shrunk, now I can keep my whole group shrunk and not worry about recharging.  Also great for LDoN groups where there not much space to get around.<br />
<br />
Haste on the otherhand will be great now and if you are going to be a non-raiding bazaar equiped warrior a cloak of flames would probably be the only haste you will ever need.<br />
<br />
So the choice is between setting yourself up with haste from now until you reach the point of being able to obtain a haste item from raiding, or hanging on to an item that you will regret selling once you reach the point of raiding every night.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kiya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Keep your bracer, just save up for a soul scream belt.  Better yet, get a partner or two and camp your own soul scream!  (Worked for me! ;D )<br />
<br />
I'm a wood elf warrior, too.  You'll get my cobalt bracer when you pry it from my cold, dead hands!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>wickedwoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Wow, good advice all around. Thanks, y'all. Looks like I'll be keeping my bracer and saving my plat. My only real issue that I only play maybe once a week (it's been a long, slow journey) so I can't count on a lot of LDoN or excessive farming. I'll get there, all clickies intact. Now to figure out which mob is hoarding the soul scream belt ...<br />
<br />
And Dununder! Long time no see. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kavak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Cobalt bracer is almost a must imo if you raid.  If you do not raid at all its worth less, but still very nice.<br />
<br />
Its one of the few items out there that I was willing to spend a lot of money on. I sold one once months ago and regretted it everytime I was on my warrior. Thankfully I recently got another one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Zynth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">it infurates me to no end that iksar cant use the cobalt bracer...not even from invintory =(<br />
i cant tell you how many batteries my shrinking device goes through on each VT run.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Esvee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">It is probably still a bit early in your career for you to need a Cobalt bracer; It's one of those items you buy once you can't  upgrade anything for a realistic amount of pp anymore. <br />
<br />
On raids it is very handy, especially if you MT a lot, but apart from that it is just a plaything. Sell it for a good price and get one of the karana deity bracers and a soulscream belt is my advice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Khazzuz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Now to figure out which mob is hoarding the soul scream belt ... <br />
<br />
The absolute best map I have ever found for Veksar, mob you're looking for is number 13 on the map.  Might want to check out what else drops there too, bunch of good stuff in there.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Bonequest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Two items I will never ever sell are my cobalt bracer and cobalt greaves.  I don't wear either but I use both every day.</div></div><hr />
