This is my main and from as far as I know I dont have any great ways of makeing money :( (any info on how to do this would be great :) )  Anyways I know I am not going to be as good as a twink but hey I try my best :) .  I was hoping I could get better Hp items and Ac items.  I also was hoping to get better haste items 2.  Any suggestions/ideas would be great.  Thank you so much!!!!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">LDoN dungeons are probably your best way of making money I would say.  As for haste items, fbss is pretty good, to go up from there gets expensive because you are looking at soulscream belt from veksar and enchanted sash of wonder in the 31% category which run probably 15-30k depending on server.  For items, it just depends on what is available on your server.  At your level I had plate boots of light on my feet, oxidized fine plate leggings, aged iron ring and velium fire wedding ring, grand bracelet of war eternal, dented kunzar helm, don't recall everything else but those are some relatively inexpensive suggestions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The best advice anyone can give you is to level up. Not only will you get innate increases in HP and AC due to defense skill, but you will have a much easier time getting plats. You might consider doing some LDoN to get Death Embracer's out of Mistmoore. The items are 150 pts each so they should not be too hard to get. Once you can start saving some plats, I would recommed either purchasing or working a trade for some Fierce Heraldic armor. Those items should last you a long, long time. Your weapons should be fine for now. When you get some levels you should work toward getting a Copper Hammer of Striking and a Sword of the Bloodsworn. Also at 55, I highly recommend getting a Greatstaff of Thunder - the best tradeable weapon you can get for the plats. They often sell for 100pp. If you where on my server I would give you one!<br />
<br />
The only immediate changes I would make to your gear are your earrings and 1 ring. Get another 6/65 ring and try to get a couple player made 35hp/25mana ears. Bag the gobby ear for later use.</div></div><hr />

Levels are your friend. I resisted getting past 52 forever... had (then) gimp items, and had gear envy. Basically - if you blow 3k in the bazaar these days... you generally will be able to get to 50 NP, and from then on... farming for plat gets lots easier.<br />
