I am curently equipping a Sews with anger 3. I dont realy have any unusual agro problems in any pop zones. I hold a pretty solid agro for clearings and have more or less stealth agro for named fights post furious. However whenever i enter GOD my agro goes all to hell. On Ferubi clearings for Rondo i basicly cannot outagro anyone wich makes me feal rather stupid honestly. In flagging groups in Tipt etc i sudenly get slow outagroed on every mob, in Kod taz rangers outagro me baiscly by just kicking the mob. (i hold fine furious agro on named still)<br />
<br />
I am wondering what i am facing. I am by now thinking that GOD somehow is coded for dual wielding quadro anger 3 agro proc either becuase of the slashing imune mobs or simply from coding tricks. Obviously Echo of anger etc would help some however i think the difference from xpansion to xpansion is to big to be coincidential. <br />
<br />
Anyways now im mumblering, i wonder what others stand on this issue is.</div></div><hr />

Generally by that time, they've got a vdd, a dbow, or an eoe/jos combo.  That's not to say bow/sews can't work, they're just not the weapons of choice.</div></div><hr />

As a Rogue still mainhanding a DoI (not the top dps but quite aggro in most situations) I don't draw unwanted attention in GoD anymore than I do in ldon hards or solro/tactics etc.  I can still get it against many tanks if I am in a mood to do so but it surely is no worse than elsewhere in my experiences, with a vastly different array of tanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Spell agro in GoD (especially ferubi, vxed, tipt) is over the top.  I find it almost impossible to do vxed/tipt as a warrior.  I watch vxed/tipt being done by paladins with no difficulty.  I have had 5 hour vxed runs where the cleric died 20+ times due to agro.  The cleric didn't have scs3.  If the spell agro was not so high, I might hate GoD less.<br />
<br />
I have WA1, BoC + Anger3 / CHSD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">quirkyguy</div><div class="date">07-03-2004, 12:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Jobned do you have WA5?  And Bellow of the martusq *or however it is spelt*<br />
<br />
I think those are both essential for GoD especially once you're in KT.<br />
<br />
I never had the pleasure of owning a SEWS or BoW, so I don't really know how they compare.  But my VDD when I first entered GoD held good agro, EoE/a3 JoS hold much better agro.  So getting a couple good 1handers would definately fix your problem in my opinion, or snagging a Vdd and putting a3 on it.</div></div><hr />

GoD is a bit different it seems</div></div><hr />

<br />
We had 2 Darkblade, 2 Fleshbiter, 3 BoW.<br />
<br />
I was one of the 3 BoW, and with WA5 CE25 i has no problems getting &amp; keeping agro.<br />
Of course couldnt compete with the other warriors. <br />
<br />
But Never had a single Wizard/Necro die on &quot;Normal Bosses&quot;.<br />
(KnockBacks did give me some trouble in Ikkinz, but Destruction boss fine)<br />
<br />
Imo the BoW can last until OOW without too much trouble.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If anything the addition of scs3 makes it seem like agro is even better in GoD, as damage comes in so much faster in this expansion and heals can pretty much be spammed instantly just as long as bellow is used also, and agro not shift.<br />
<br />
With max aa's and A3 kinda surprised to hear of a problem since i use the same, aside from Taunt itself sucking, but when hasn't taunt sucked. Just a lot of higher mobs in GoD so its to be expected.</div></div><hr />

<br />
live agro is based on dmg and what not. anger prots blah blah blah, you know the deal.<br />
<br />
undead agro is based on nearness to the mob. ie: if you are attacking a mob and are 5 feet away from it and proc anger 500 times and i walk in and get like 4 feet away from the mob, ill get agro.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is why Karnor's has so many trains. someone would pull from the skel tower and pull to the zone in. someone from the dog tower would go down to the 1st floor and the mob would agro him. he would run back and the dog tower wouldnt be able to handle and they would run to the zone with dogs and skels. then everyone would bitch about everyone else training them.<br />
<br />
not sure if this is still the case they have made tons of changes to agro so whatever.<br />
<br />
/hugs everyone</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lokkak</div><div class="date">07-04-2004, 04:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is Live Mob agro and Undead Argo, unless they changed it to all Live Mob Agro.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well my problem is like this:<br />
<br />
With cleric and enchanter at near max range hanging behind me, I pull the mob from it spawn point with an arrow (shoot till I hit for x damage) run to camp, turn around, spam incite until it lands * OR * wait till the mob hits me once and then cast incite, then turn on attack, then bash slam/kick for most of the fight.  I have WA1 and anger 3'd Blade of Carnage and CHSD.  Most of the time, the mob will run to then enchanter or cleric in the first 15 seconds.<br />
<br />
If the cleric and the enchanter don't have LR5/ID5 and 6k hp, it makes for a very frustrating day, since most of my play time the mobs are beating on the cleric or enchanter.  I play with multiple clerics and enchanters, but this is a universal experience in GoD.  I don't see this (ever) in other zones.  I don't always have this problem.  It is much worse when the cleric doesn't have SCS3.<br />
<br />
This isn't a live/undead thing for me.  Also, I don't think it is &quot;you notice it more because in vxed the mobs hit hard and can quickly kill a cleric&quot; kind of thing.  I get angry frustrated and mad if I lose agro.   I notice when I lose agro.  I guess I still could be confused, but it doesn't matter.  I hate playing in GoD because of this problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">07-04-2004, 04:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd say aggro issue is half from aggro might be different (sure feels different, but hard to prove it) and half from loss of aggro having far greater complications than normal due to mob difficulty.

<br />
Lokkak I was in tipt and sewers all night and i'm not seeing it.What is your hp/ac and are the chanters tashing and slowing fast?I can't see the group dynamics from this distance that would likely cause the prob.My cleric got murdered once today in tipt from straight heal aggro because I'm a little bit lightweight there with the changes to some of the mobs and he healed someone else and me early.<br />
<br />
Aggro is no prob for me usually there, it's just tested a bit more because people want to debuff and heal very fast imo.Sewers is like beng in ldons hehe and Vxed seems normal.Spent like 15 hours this week pulling stupid pookas from the cubby with no aggro probs stuff just hit harder.I get ripped fast enough in tipt now that the healer treads a finer line on aggro especially early in the fight.Everything seems to work normal...just more pressure.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
This is your main problem, WA5 is really needed, I've tanked Tipt and Vxxed on a WA3 warrior with a BoW and still have consistent agro problems if I don't get a proc early on (much &lt;3 now SotPM)<br />
<br />
Also if you are using a BoC and CHSD I'm guessing your gear is not high elemental/time which really helps, yeah it can be done without but it does help alot and seems you need this sort of agro, and dual weild on these mobs isn't a good thing considering 1 riposte can be 1100dmg. <br />
<br />
My guess is that your cleric is having to use lights pretty fast and the 2 weapons you have just are not proccing enough/generating the agro needed to last the first heal, get WA5 and you'll see a nice difference, and try to have the cleric HoT on inc (especially now it heals more) and try to CH you for the mobs.<br />
<br />
<br />
Buuuut this is all a little offtopic, GoD up to Transcendant so far as we have gotten, I have seen nothing odd about agro, you need alot more as the fights are much shorter and more dps but all the same rules of agro still apply.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">saniri</div><div class="date">07-04-2004, 03:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I almost always three box my warrior, cleric and druid(both healers with SCS3) so i know when they are going to get agro and save up my discs accordingly, rarely when i group with other healers i always have mob mezzed and slowed first before anyone engages. You get alot of time in tipt/vxed so use it to your advantage. One CR easily exceeds the time you waste in mezzing/slowing first. <br />
<br />
I use BoW+A3+AHR gloves and have WA5 and its not that i dont trust my aggro, i just dont trust healers i don't know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lokkak</div><div class="date">07-04-2004, 03:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gunnar, I have 9716 HP raid buffed with 1805 AC.  I am usually 9100 to 9500 in vxed/tipt with 1720 to 1760 ac or so.  I know that is very low, but I don't have the AA to train in sturdiness yet.  I have LR5/ID5 but only 152 AA.<br />
<br />
One enchanter can tash at max range and never get agro, another tash 5 seconds into combat or so and gets agro.  So it does appear to depend on AA/Gear the other classes have.  Also, it is much better with a CoD pet.  With a CoD Pet, the mob is slowed at like 40 percent health remaining.  But most of the time when I have a CoD pet, I have two clerics and a druid.  One cleric is always casting BoVie/Celestials and the other CH with the druid fast healing.  Agro is &quot;ok&quot; but I have to have it &quot;spread&quot; around 3 healers.<br />
<br />
This is your main problem, WA5 is really needed<br />
<br />
So I must pay 60 AA to have so so agro?  It has honestly came to the point that two paladins I know with less hp and ac are significantly a better tank (safer) to take on a tipt run than me.  I have played cleric or druid (I have 65 of both also) on a number of tipt/vxed runs with a paladin tank and they don't seem to ever lose agro.<br />
<br />
I didn't have much confidence in WA fixing my problem, because right now I often go 30 to 40 seconds with no procs.  I also have 7 or 8 procs in a row back to back.  If I had WA5, I could still expect to see 10 to 15 seconds with no procs (my guess) and this would still kill a cleric.<br />
<br />
I guess there are just too many factors in this problem.  It almost too frustrating to play in GoD for me, and since most everyone plays here my only source of exp is GoD or random out of guild groups (like ldon or bot which are very low exp.)  Without exp, I can't get WA5.</div></div><hr />

I've been all through the sewers, vxed and tipt without any major problems at 9700hps/1650ac (9400/1600 in average groups). My problems started to all but vanish with WA1-2.<br />
<br />
As for the Sews + anger 3 ... i wouldnt trust it to hold aggro <br />
<br />
/shrug ... its been my experience that spell hate far surpasses any dps aggro for reliability in GoD trials ... and 1 anger3 and a dinkey rune3 really wont cut it unless you get very lucky.  I wouldnt take any 2hander other than a BoWar into a trial personally.  You simply get more bang for your buck with some decent 1handers paired off with anger3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">07-05-2004, 11:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No warrior has 0 aggro problems unless you play alone.No knights I know have 0 aggro problems either for that matter.However, our aggro potential now is vastly better than ever.No warrior has anything approaching aggro lock early in a fight so it depends a lot on the people you are playing with.An a3'd BOC and CSHD should do fairly well imo.You appear well set up for vxed ,but ,like myself a little light to straight tank in Tipt.I have to be aggressive and not slacking in Tipt to hold aggro decently,unlike say fire where I can easily hold heal aggro on 3+ mobs and only worry about dps aggro.I think Tipt will challenge you with heal aggro,but,should be doable though very hard.In Vxed you should be fine with a good group who recognize you're not a pally.It's ok when you're screwing around somewhere trivial for the chanter to tash incoming mobs,but, not in places they're likely to get one rounded.Your group has to take the worst case odds seriously because the ring is streaky and will let you down.<br />
<br />
You look ok to tank in Vxed to me.However,aggro is fundamental to your job and a warriors biggest handicap.If you see a way to improve your aggro you should take it within reason.If you're comparing yourself with offensive aa'd wars with wa-5 you'll find yourself lacking.You should easily be able to hold aggro on a ch on incoming and debuffs/dps can be delayed a little.Any group must work as a team or face the wipe when it comes and no warrior can do his job consistently  if every caster go's max aggro from the start.<br />
<br />
I'd say relax on Tipt unless your with friends who feel up to the challenge and play with people who are willing to work with you in Vxed and sewers etc.Don't lock yourself into a singlular expectation of aggro.Battles require fluidity and compensation for bad timing and the unexpected.Not sure if i understood correctly,but, generally you should arrow till the mob closes then hit attack before it engages you not after.Having your bow in hand during melee is bad.Unless the mob is veering off I incite after I engage with melee,but, this is subject to change depending on the situation.Finally,if your allowing yourself to get really frustrated about aggro you should back up a bit and relax.Those feelings will make you play worse , send you into zerg mode and prevent you from properly seeing and dealing with the problem.<br />
<br />
Aggro can be very frustrating at times,but, your tools are limited so do what you can to make the best of them.I think you should be fine in Vxed given a reasonably patient group.If not take a break for awhile for more aa and gear.Wa is a small price to pay for a good improvement in aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ibithor</div><div class="date">07-06-2004, 10:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">sounds like a combination of factors to me, several good points have been made about different factors that could contribute to your losing aggro consistently<br />
<br />
1. Casters skill and aa-I played a necro and cleric and trust me SCS3 DOES matter, as does timing your cast. If you are consistently pulling aggro off a tank, you adjust on the spot, you address the issues with the tank later as they most likely arent instantly fixable (ie he knows how to do his job but its just not working for some reason).<br />
<br />
2. Heals needed-With the recent changes to the hits in GoD, maybe you arent good enuff anymore. I had to face that fact about myself in GoD post sewers, you do have a few hundred more hp and about 150 more ac tho so i cant say thats it.<br />
Might want to pick up Tactical Mastery3 to reduce riposte damage from 2hand weaps. 1100 a riposte makes spikey damage and eliminating some might allow cleric to heal a little differently and pull less aggro. Heal over times on inc help, but they can put cleric on ramp list early so be careful. Have you considered going evasive on some of the trash? might also help with need for spam heals that draw 2 tons of aggro.<br />
<br />
3. Your offensive AA-ambi, Ferocity, flurry, WA5, punishing balde, etc are really useful for aggro. Increasing swings at a mob or increasing proc rates both help aggro. If you dont get a lot of AA, do what i have done so far and buy them but get them according to cost. Like start with the cheapest ones and work on all of them in order of increasing costs. Im up to the ones that cost 6aa each now. So far i have flurry1, ferocity3, punishing blade2, and wa2. I can tell i hold aggro better now than i did before, no doubt at all.<br />
<br />
4. Your methods of maintaining aggro-seems generally agreed you are doing things right here. Arrow in mob on inc, taunt, incite etc<br />
<br />
you cannot compare yourself to a pally for holding aggro, they have aggro procs on demand(stuns) and any knight can keep aggro off any warrior, at least until the mob kills them :P<br />
half the aggro responsibility is on the tank, you must do all you can to get and keep aggro, but half is also on the others in the group to manage their aggro. never ever forget that<br />
<br />
without being in the group and observing what happens firsthand, its hard to say really what is going wrong</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yathaghera</div><div class="date">07-06-2004, 12:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I spent the entire weekend doing Vxed and Tipt trials, I have a BoW, anger 3 aug, and WA3.  I didn't have any agro problems, if I lost agro I would incite and taunt and kept it firmly on me, even with a rogue going all out.  <br />
<br />
I have one question though, we seem to be hearing various stories about the Tipt boss, I heard that he gets stronger if you move him too much from his spawn point and that you can't tank him defensive, any truth to these rumors?</div></div><hr />

I think its a combination of things really. Most all of which have been said in this thread so not sure how much more I can add to it. I will say this, I hear people suggesting VDD auged and I have to ask why? I can tell you for sure, without question my BoW will outagro an auged VDD any day of the week. So I wouldn't buy that weapon for any other purpose than DPS, which imo is what it was made for.<br />

To answer the question on tipt boss. If you pull him out of his room, he will hit for 3800 non defensive. Moving him inside his room I have seen no change in his melee though. Pull him out of that room down to the safe room past riddler and get ready to wipe since the change anyway. It wasn't always like that but it is now.</div></div><hr />

Don't know about the away from spawn damage, but the defensive info is correct.  You lose a set amount of agro every tick if using a discipline.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">07-07-2004, 03:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That sounds about right.  My guild's main offtank is a paladin and he always goes for aggro early on any pull, basically to establish an aggro lead over the healers and debuffers.  Therefore, I have tons of experience in competing with him for aggro (e.g. when first taunt fails).  I can say the following:<br />
<br />
Pally stun &gt; one early Anger3 proc (600) <br />
Pally stun &lt; two Anger3 procs (1200)<br />
Pally stun &lt; one Anger3 plus Incite, just barely (1000)<br />
Pally stun ~= one Anger3 plus 3 rounds of melee (900?)<br />
Pally stun ~= two Anger2 procs (900)</div></div><hr />

Hope to have it parsed in other places too eventually (and get SK's parsed at the same time).<br />

BTW you get a 6% melee aggro increase Sassinak if you switch your weapons around (assuming 1.4 aggro mod for Warriors), probally more in increased stun procs as well.</div></div><hr />
