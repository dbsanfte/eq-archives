<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Looks like the poll has gathered about all the data it's going to.<br />
Now, what are we going to do with this information?  Personally, I'd like to print it all on a wrecking ball and send it through the EQ dev team's offices, but that might be a little extreme.  Any thoughts guys?<br />
<br />
Beo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">What I would first recommend would be throwing out the lowest and reevaluating the higher results.<br />
<br />
The key is figuring out if the results are really good suggestions or just reactionary.  The best way to do this is to have people comment on why things like &quot;Improve Taunt&quot; are good and bad.  If people can't explain why its good or bad to get &quot;Improved Mitigation&quot; is good or bad in given situations then don't suggest it.<br />
<br />
After culling the ideas again somehow present them to SOE.  Catch whoever it is responsible for Melee issues and well...I'm not sure if torture will work. ^_^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Binnamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Time for another poll maybe, and with those areas that got more then 5% of the votes or something?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aveen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Something that is discussed for 2 months is not reactionary.<br />
<br />
Right now I am so mad about the upcomming patch that I would be happy to send the wrecking ball through the dev office windo myself.... again and again and again.<br />
<br />
We need to take the top 5 or 6 ideas and make a signable petition.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If we're really gonna just discard all but the top 5 idea's then the poll was a waste of time. there's also a problem in that general idea's that go together like adding warrior utility were watered down into different subsets (stacking, new class skills, new attacks, discipline changes etc) which could all have come under one heading and gained more weight.  Also specific idea's loose out to general sentiment choices like 'improve taunt' or 'improve ac/hp/mitigation'.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Err...the purpose of the poll was to narrow down 5 things we really want, to tell SOE that the other stuff isn't as important, this is what we've decided is crucial. Other bonuses would be nice but as a community we can deal without them as long as we get these few improvements. If we go to SoE saying we want 20 different things, we're gonna be ignored.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I don't think all but the top five should be thrown out, I think the full list needs to be given to the devs somehow.<br />
<br />
I do think that the list should be ordered from what we see as the most important to least important, give them a working order so to speak.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">They won't be discarded.<br />
<br />
The purpose is to specify some areas so that we can break them down more. For isntance &quot;New skills&quot; can mean a ton of different things, but if it was presented as simply &quot;Give me a new skill&quot; we're going to end up with /shield version 2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Binnamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If we go to SoE saying we want 20 different things, we're gonna be ignored. <br />
<br />
You mean like druids? :D<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
We need rezzes too. ~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Rhagulim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">A new poll giving only the most voted for options is a good idea.  Last night I had a PoV invite (I'm lvl 59 so I was like hell ya!), then had it canceled when the guy's group said, &quot;oh sorry, we only want a pally or sk&quot;, because they (rightly) knew they'd all get beat on if I tanked, not because of my lvl (which was low), but because even a few lvls higher I still couldn't hold the aggro without insane weapons.  GRR I'm about an inch away from rolling a SK and saying screw it.  I don't have the pp for a BoW, hell my best aggro weap is a frosty, and I'm getting sick of having group members die after playing their classes like usual and getting beat down because I can't hold aggro or taunt it off them.  <br />
<br />
/rant off OK my point is I like the poll idea :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Apothes Drudoll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">every warrior should just copy the list (by list I mean the poll with the %'s of votes) then go to eqlive.com click on the e-mail your server gm and submit the list :) if enough warriors do it then it will get thier attention.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">that circumvents the point of the poll but...whatever!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Apothes Drudoll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">that circumvents the point of the poll but...whatever!<br />
<br />
