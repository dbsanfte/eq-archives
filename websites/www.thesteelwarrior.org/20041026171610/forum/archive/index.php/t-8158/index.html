<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">the OoW teaser say that Mata Muran flee to is land when hero managed to defeet his outpost on talosian continent. so maybe that we must wait OoW to see the final Boss gate in the middle of the fight in OoW, letting a none-totally-closed portal behind him to let the adventurer brotherhood build a clone of this portal between their boat and the newbie zone in OoW (remember that this expension is for lvl 1 to 70).<br />
so this 50% health crashes is jsut a segmentation fault cause code don't find OoW memory :)</div></div><hr />

dont know if this is only guild who did the pixxt. Or if any further progressson acheived by other guilds.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Solanthious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">It's pretty interesting how that fight works, kudos to some fairly original ideas for a change.</div></div><hr />

Had Xxeric down to 20-30% a couple of times, but ironically our lack of knights (or other ATs) were our downfall since 5 of the pops were nomez and we had 1 pal and 4 wars total, and someone had to tank the boss. More balanced turnout and we would've reached enrage at least, with solid numbers. Would've liked to beat the 'pre-nerf' version</div></div><hr />

Difficulty of the encounter rests too much on luck (type of add pops) imo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah it's been too much luck based since the type of adds you get seems totally random. If you get lots mezzables, it would be pisseasy. We've had the goat at 5% and 9% on our best runs but like for Demorgoth's guild we haven't had the right class balance there on our attempts since we haven't even been able to fill the 54 limit :/ Anyway we'll see soon what happened to the adds if anything, just rumors so far.. Don't really see the need for gimping adds though personally except maybe make it less random which kind of adds spawn each time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Demorgoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Oh well, so much for beating the 'nerfed' version of Xxeric. They could change him into a moss snake and make him drop 50 items of loot and it wouldn't matter, coz Zun has been changed into a_Dev_Cockblock06. <br />
<br />
Can't see anyone, anywhere, beating him now with the 54 people who can enter Tacvi after him. Not without discovering a new sploit or unintended loophole of some kind.</div></div><hr />

Well, he's not unbeatable, but after killing Xxeric and Riel on our first tries at them on Wednesday, it was pretty annoying to actually lose to Tkarish. I feel we were close, and if timer was 15 minutes longer it would be no problem, but it still has relatively little margin for error. It is pretty funny that I'm more worried about getting Tkarish fight down again than I am the third set of bosses (one of whom is bugged anyhow).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Moss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Well, we didn't get to try him before the nerf, but now the event just seems WAY too dependant on luck. Yesterday we managed to get him to 45%, today... we went 3 attempts in a row without being able to dps him at all. I guess eventually we'll get lucky and kill him but then 2 probles arise:<br />
1. Which 10 people do you tell they can't go to tacvi.<br />
2. We have to get lucky again in 5 days, and who knows if the 10 people that couldn't go to tacvi would even bother logging on...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Korinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Which 10 people do you tell they can't go to tacvi. <br />
<br />
Thats a luxury many guilds dont have, be happy you dont have to cancel raids because your 10 people short.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Madren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">knowing ahead of time you will get  only 4 adds, and know exactly what those adds will be does some what gimp  the event.   You still must deal with them though.<br />
<br />
most tacvi guilds are not fielding  more then 54  consistantly, i would wager.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Zun's doable with low 40's as it is, so if they don't login it wouldnt really  matter too much.<br />

Agreed on both, we get mid 40s most of the time.</div></div><hr />
