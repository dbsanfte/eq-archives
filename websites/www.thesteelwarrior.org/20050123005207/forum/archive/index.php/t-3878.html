<br />
I was on a raid in Kael the other day and when the mob got out of melee range I would try to shoot an arrow at them and it did not work.<br />
I never had this happen before.<br />
To fire arrows I had to turn off auto attack.<br />
Is this new or a nerf of some sort.<br />
Or am I loosing my mind and just never noticed this before?<br />
I could swear I use to pop off an arrow or 2 before I got back in melee range.<br />
<br />
Also while I am here does anyone else have trouble targeting giants with their hot key?<br />
I only seem to have this problem with giants that I ever seem to notice.<br />
Giants in any zone not just Kael.<br />
I can be biting their ankle and pounding my hot key and just not targeting them.<br />
I have to place curser on them to target.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's always been that way. When you &quot;attack&quot; both melee attack and range attack are greyed out.</div></div><hr />
