<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bigdung</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Why does it take so long to ding at the end of the exp bar? I was in a LDON last night and needed 2% to ding 65. Well the dungeon timer ran out before I got that last 2%. We won the Ldon and we used the last 30 min to try to get my ding. All I have to say is AHHHHHHHHHHHH!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Perception?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>graderr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">because you focus to much on it... like the saying a watched pot doesn't boil. in the last bue you are expecting to hear the ding sound and don't want to get cought off guard, so you tend to look at your exp more then when it is at any other place. also has to do with the long minute and the short minute.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>irmingnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Why, because god hates you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well, Gnomers hates you anyway, but he hates everyone and it's a struggle every day for him to not get banned for it, so take it with a grain of salt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>irmingnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">pftt Haas you should really talk.  You are an asshole in about 99.9% of every theard you post.  So if you want to call me an asshole, I advise you look in the mirror I gaurantee that the finger will be putting at you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">hey dont be hard on haass. he is the reason i can rant all over the place and put you all down without looking bad. i hide behind him :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">haass said 'hates everyone' not 'is an asshole'<br />
the difference is that everyone hates assholes and mke joks on the one who hates everybody ...<br />
:P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>irmingnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">it was just a joke anyway.   but what I said about haas still stands he is by far worse of an asshole than me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">This is not an argument you want to pursue.</div></div><hr />

You had 100% going to AA?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Adzar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">LOL Iskander says in a not so subtle way that all y'all need to stfu!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">haha<br />
<br />
in this case I just think his stance is weak.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">yah Haass is an ass<br />
but I have a good laugh more often then not reading his posts. Althought he does take geting used to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>irmingnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Pfttt</div></div><hr />

Gnomers = Banned from a name once because he refused to stop slinging shit instead of stating his opinion, even when asked nicely, and then on his new name, given a &quot;Timeout&quot; for telling someone to get the fuck out of here.<br />
<br />
Now, it's true that Isk doesn't have the stones to ban me, see, because I'm important. I carry a lot of weight around here.  Me walking into a discussion is akin to the Pope coming to dinner, and Gnomers is just like that guy that sells peanuts at the stadium, but that's just details.  Fact of the matter is that even tho I have this annoying tendancy to always be right, and I&quot;m pretty abrasive, I'm still an American favorite, and you're still just Gnomers.<br />
<br />
Not that there's anything wrong with that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Bourbon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Once second, got to open a window, Haass' ego is forceing all the air out of the room.</div></div><hr />

Gnomers wasn't banned I changed his email address that did not exist any mod can confirm that.  I made this username after a little Hiatus from here,  if you remember that thread at all.   <br />
<br />
Yes I got a 1 week ban for telling that known asswipe to fuck off.  Am I sorry, no I can't say I am since that poster is a known troll that will just spam this board with nothing but stupid WoW links. <br />
<br />
<br />
Isk doesn't have the balls to ban you, you are important,  I see is post from sad lonely disgruntled guy.  The rest I will take as sarcasm because anyone can't be that dilluted to think who post like a disgruntled postal worker to be any importance to this message board or even in his sad pathetic every day life.</div></div><hr />

Well first, I know sarcasim is sometimes hard to catch, but that's what Haass' post was and second, a guy that hasn't seen pussy since birth shouldn't tell someone that is married and has a kid about his sad and lonely life.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>irmingnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">WoW bourbon you came to that deduction all by yourself and I didn't know that you were Haas also.  Wait your not Haas then try to explain to me why the fuck are you butting in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Bourbon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">If ya don't want me buttin in, then I suggest you take it to PM's.  This is, after all, a public forum.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>irmingnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Damn't it is hard to make a come back when your post make sense!!!!</div></div><hr />
