What's the easiest way to use this, and in what situations?  Is setting up a hotkey best?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ulfur</div><div class="date">05-22-2003, 06:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">/shield is best for situations when your healer/slower has grabed way to much agro and you cant taunt the mob off them. <br />
<br />
A good hotkey macro is:<br />
/assist<br />
/shield<br />
/g shielding %T<br />
<br />
assuming you have the mob targeted you should end up shielding the person getting bashed, you do have to retarget the mob afterward, but if it saves your group some downtime then its all good.<br />
<br />
The range on shield is really small, you basically have to be in mellee distance of the person you wish to shield for it to fire properly, but the good news is, if you aren't in range then you havent wasted it, you can just hit it again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ariene</div><div class="date">05-22-2003, 06:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't know how to set it up, but I can tell you that if you do use it your cleric will love you.  :)<br />
<br />
If you have an enchanter as the group's slower, make a hotkey for the chanter.  Some warriors make one for the cleric too but the enchanter is more likely to need it (unless your cleric is clueless) if you only have room for one macro.<br />
<br />
Edit:  I love the assist idea!  I use assist to see who has agro for healing all the time but wouldn't have thought of it for this.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">05-22-2003, 06:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i actually prefer to set up 2 /3 separatehotkeys rather than the assist method which i find can be glitchy sometimes.<br />
<br />
Whenever i start a group i have one for cleric/sham/ench or their equivalent.<br />
<br />
also, dont shield just because a mob is whaling on caster, try taunt first, if that doesnt work, then shield. its useful to tell the group before you start that you are setting hotkeys for them and tell them if they are getting hit to stay put and not run around like headless chickens. for it to work, you really have to be standing immediately adjacent to the caster facing the mob.<br />
<br />
as the slowers normally get aggro most commonly, when i pull i will just run straight to them and stand next to them so if they do get aggro they are already next to me.<br />
<br />
your group will lvoe you for it. its definitely saved a few lives afaik.</div></div><hr />

Welcome to the board, O /shielded one!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I use /shield (slowers name) hot key and if it looks like the healer is clueless or the mobs in the zone just don't like them, then I set one up for them also......</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I usually keep a /shield hot key ready made for my slower(chanter or shammy) and healer...<br />
<br />
One thing i have noticed i almost always get immediate (dont want to call it agro) attention from the mob when i shield someone..i saw another thread on this for better info..<br />
<br />
i just notice that i may be wailing &amp; taunting away on a mob to get agro off my chanter..then i hit /shield hotkey and its immediate the mob turns to me...just my observations....</div></div><hr />

<br />
True that... I generally set up one for my enchanter and one for cleric.  if no enchanter in group will set it up for shaman, but rarely use it since agro control isn't so much of an issue with shaman in group (WOOT for malo creating little agro hehe)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Compo</div><div class="date">05-22-2003, 03:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Instead of setting up mutliple hotkeys for different grp member, try the follwoing:<br />
<br />
/assist<br />
/pause 2<br />
/shield</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grendonbb</div><div class="date">05-22-2003, 04:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, that would work... but that means 2 full seconds of no attacks, and ending up having the wrong person targeted.  If you just do /shield &lt;name&gt; as a hotkey, and just change it each time a new slower/healer joins the group, you don't have to change targets, nor pause at all.  works a lot better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Compo</div><div class="date">05-22-2003, 04:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can see your point. Firstly, pause 2 is more like 0.2 second (not 2 seconds). Secondly, you may want to shield other classes in the party sometimes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rexiant</div><div class="date">05-23-2003, 02:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've found -<br />
<br />
/assist<br />
/shield<br />
<br />
to be glitchy too. I get the message, &quot;You must target a living Player Character to shield&quot; or something like that. I added one tenth of a second pause in there and the problem went away. So these days it's -<br />
<br />
/assist<br />
/pause 1<br />
/shield<br />
<br />
I use -<br />
<br />
/shield &lt;name&gt;<br />
<br />
on a situational basis as needed. I find 2 or 3 named shield keys to be too cumbersome at times. Going the assist route, and linking it to a good spot on the KB just makes things easier for me. Plus if i reacquire agro before the /shield goes off it doesn't waste it since you cannot /shield yourself. <br />
<br />
/agree &quot;Always try to taunt first and save /shield&quot;<br />

ps - Does anyone know if there is a /command that can be hotkey'd to toggle you to your previous target? After shielding I'm retargeting via &quot;closest NPC&quot; key (unless we have mezzed or uninvolved NPC's around), I know you can TAB to previous target...just curious if there's a way to set it up auto. Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes there is such a thing but it must be mapped ( the same place where you re-map the attack key, I forget what it is called though ) I have mine mapped to &quot;q&quot;.<br />
<br />
Tab is to switch between you and your last target fyi :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ragnok</div><div class="date">05-23-2003, 11:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just have 2 buttons that i use. one is called 'healer', the other 'slower'.<br />
<br />
Each just has /shield x. When i change groups i just change the names. It seems  to work fine. <br />
<br />
I combined kick and disarm into 1 button to save room. If you are really out of space you could combine taunt into that as well. The only problem is that you cant tell when the abilities refresh.</div></div><hr />
