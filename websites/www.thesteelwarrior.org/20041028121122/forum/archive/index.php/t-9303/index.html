<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bonequest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My guild just needs to flag like 30 people before we go into plane of time and we have been trying to kill her for 2 days now.  It seems like she is a lot harder now or broken.  The chancellors seem to auto agro now and it is total chaos every time we pull.  We have killed her several times before ooW came out and it was never this hard so I am wondering what is up.  <br />
<br />
Has anyone here been able to beat her since OoW came out?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Braddox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Had the same problem on brell last Sunday.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Malric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The exact same thing happened to us the last time we tried her. We'd get her single, I'd start tanking, the adds would spawn then suddenly all her guards would go wipe out the add grps and come running for the rest of us. This was 2 weekends ago for us that it happened.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Deurgeran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hopefully this will be fixed in next patch.   Something similiar was happening on the Rallos zek script as Vallon would Aid Tallon and vallon came with friends too!  <br />
<br />
You basically had to offtank Vallon and kill tallon first, mezzing the adds.   Not nearly as hard as Xegony, but it still sounds like a similiar issue.<br />
<br />
Sony SAY'S they will have the rallos script fixed in the next patch, perhaps if they are related problems, that could be fixed as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hrmm when they added the capability for mobs to move through ports I wonder if they also broke pathing restrictions in the process?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Malric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">We went back last night and beat her in her current bugged form so it is doable. Just required modifying our strat and positioning a bit and having some very good pullers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Khumak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Aggro radii is greatly reduced when you're level 70 so pulling the waves is a bit fubar now.  We had issues too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dokor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Killed her last night (first kill woohoo) we had no problem with the djinn, armor and bug (or whatever they call) waves, but it seem that all the wave from the other side always came with at least one guardian. We managed to deal with them so it's doable but it took us some time to figure it out.</div></div><hr />

Were we the only guild that just split the raid at the fork and did Vallon and Tallon on their respective sides at the same time?  No mess with pulling triggers, no issues with adds comng through rooms... none of that junk.  Each side kills theirs, then meet again in Rallos' room.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kezla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">i'd wager not all guilds can summon the swarm to do such a feat...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Arathena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yeah, when you're pushing a script with 48 people instead of 72, things change a little... Offtanking Vallon when your raid has a total of 4 clerics and 4 druids can get a little ugly, especially since most guild are forced by the big ol deaggro to use a knight tank for Tallon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ladas Sindarin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Our average raid size for that was 58...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">noones beaten xegony on bertoxx since omens went live. 3 time guilds and an EP guild (mine) have tried and the guardians aggroing from middle is just nuts.</div></div><hr />
