<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Northerner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So, I've been doing this for a good while now.<br />
<br />
I'm a Rogue and although I've been in a more raid-orientated guild in the past, I now find myself raiding with more casual players.<br />
<br />
Here's the thing.  My nukers don't seem to think they have any push assossiated with thier spells unless Lucy tells them there is a KB effect.  I've tried to say that *any* spell is much like a melee attack and moves the target some (and in the direction you are facing) but I get a ton of resistance on that idea shall we say.<br />
<br />
Hey, I might even be wrong I guess, although we've used caster-push to effect in the past.<br />
<br />
I guess what I am looking for is some backup or at least some information.  I am about to take them all out to some rooted/high-hp mob and see if we can scoot it around.  Many are adamant that they cast nothing but spells that DD and move a target not at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Quarg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I am 99% sure that all nukes have a tiny bit of push involved. Some have more than others, some have a shitload (particularly thunder line of wizzy spells), but yeah we use caster push all the time and it works great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Derrict</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Enc nuke 1 pushback - http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3349&amp;source=Live<br />

<br />
etc etc<br />
<br />
As far as the other spells with push that have no pushback effect, I haven't seen it.  I loaded my beastlord to test this with several of the cold nukes on the katta banker and the mob wasn't moving.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Northerner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks, I appreciate the feedback.  Perhaps it is more a question of people using nukes they don't think have any push rather than there being a generic push attached to nukes in general.<br />
<br />
Interesting to learn something new even after all this time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">most 0 sec stun nukes push some. not real push but make the mobs do some weird animation witch repositions them.<br />
<br />
thunder stike will make a mob fly though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Katta banker is perma rooted and won't move.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I suspect all DD spells, like melee, have some minor push. I'd wager arrows do the same. Considering how few spells land compared to melee, it's probably not significant enough to worry about even at a raid force. That is, of course, excepting those spells with an actual knockback stat visible in Lucy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shredder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I can't say I've noticed any push with DD component only spells.  There are a few, but they're very situational.<br />
<br />
Where you see it is when the cleric decides to make use of those ornate gauntlets and nuke away with Condemnation.  On raids though, they're usually much too busy either in the chain or patch healing/rezzing.<br />
<br />
The only other two classes that I've seen that enjoy employing the push spells are wizards and paladins, on a regular basis.  More than likely, it's the pallies doing it.  Their only &quot;nuke&quot; is also a stun which has a pretty hefty pushback effect.  If you set up a minimized spell effect window, you can filter the text to it, and verify later with your favorite log parser. <br />
<br />
Also keep in mind that any weapons with a DD + stun also have a minor push effect.  You don't have any berserkers using a Chetari Wardstaff do you?<br />
<br />
I don't think you can move permarooted mobs in any fashion.  I don't recall being able to budge any of the permarooted ToV dragons, but that was long before PoP.<br />
<br />
<br />
Lucy is an awesome tool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>aspit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The push will also be in the direction the caster is facing.  For example to control fennin have casters face the same direction as fennin if you want him closer to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Derrict</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The Katta banker is perma rooted and won't move.<br />
They are rooted but it doesn't mean you can't push them.  They path back to spawn once they get moved ~ 5-10 range.  I'll post a screenshot if ya don't believe me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>AThousandYoung</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Nukes don't push as a general rule, at least on players in PvP.  Unless Lucy says the nuke has knockback, it will not force a channelling check when you get hit with it.  I used to use this to great advantage when I was low level and marauding Druids would try to hunt me down and kill me...they could not stop me from Gating.  Spells like Shock of Lightning would definitely stop a Gate though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Nukes &amp; Arrows push a LOT MORE than people will ever admit.<br />
<br />
Anyone having killed Blazaax 1.0 (100 range 2k / 10 sec AE) will remember that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">When we used to do certain mobs in pop that had to be kept in position but weren't meleed, we'd always shout &quot;nuke north&quot; or &quot;nuke south&quot; and expected every single caster to face that direction to nuke.<br />
<br />
I can't say how well it helped having the DD casters doing that too, but it never hurt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Arrows push, but not that much.  It's when you get 9-10 rangers (like we do) firing on a mob from the same direction (air avatars, for instance) is when you really start to see it.</div></div><hr />
