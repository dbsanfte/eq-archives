<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kebast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My current setup is a CHoS and a Fabled SSoY.  I'm using the Fabled SSoY over a SoBS because at my level it gives me about 2.5 more DPS.  My question is what happens when I start fighting mobs over level 55?  Will the stun still produce agro even though the mob is unaffected?  Will it be as much agro as if the stun did take effect?  Same question applies to the SRo Ykesha Augs...what happens at 55+?  I'd like to keep my DPS as high as possible and the Fabled SSoY has just a tiny bit better ratio and a 75 pt higher proc than the SoBS.  Should I even keep my SoBS?  Will there be a time I need to put the FSSoY away?  Thanks for the help...my magelo is up to date too if you want to take a look.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">yes you still get aggro on immune mob and on mob that are above lvl 55. don't panic stun aggro is still usefull whatever your oponent's lvl. for history remember that weapons whith stun above lvl 55 useable by us, warrior, can be count on fingers.<br />
this is the list of I am aware, so if we remove the shit (archery/throwing) we have 7 one hander and 2 two hander... not that much when there is so many possibility for normal stun. if stun aggro won't stop above stun lvl then we would never use them (as MT we fight only red cons mob, so lvl more than 68 which is our best stun lvl).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kebast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'll keep it around and use the FSSoY for now :).<br />

Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nazgrub</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Since aggro is basically the same, all that matters is the DPS and maybe tanking stats.  I use the equation that is in the library:<br />
<br />
(Damage x 2 + Damage Bonus)/Delay for main hand<br />
<br />
SoBS = 1.89<br />
<br />
FSSoY = 1.83<br />
<br />
CHoS = 1.9<br />
<br />
I chose to main hand the CHoS, equation comes out about the same, plus the proc is bigger and the delay is a tiny tiny bit higher (ripostes).<br />
<br />
For off-hand I just go by pure ratio since damage bonus doesn't come into play, and FSSoY has the best ratio.<br />
<br />
Also, yes the stun procs aggro even if the mob can't be stunned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kebast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The Ykesha Augs have a stun and a 125 DD.  Is that combined effect equal ~400 Hate?  I suppose if your fighting a 56+ mob that the stun doesn't effect and the DD gets resisted, Hate is still the same?  Also, do all stuns produce that same Hate (not counting any DD associated with them)?  CHoS has Stun + 179 DD, FSSoY has Stun + 150 DD, SoBS has Stun + 75 DD...Are all the same agro aside from the bit of DD difference?  I'm saving for an Anger 3 for my CHoS and am going to get a Ykesha Aug for one of my other weapons...If Ykesha Stun = Planar Strike Stun for Hate its going on the FSSoY.  If Planar Strike is More Hate, then going with the SoBS.  You get the idea...any suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Omnus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">No one is sure if a resisted stun gets the same amount of agro, but resisted/immune stun still generates alot. But don't trhough the sobs to the wind, being able to stun level 65 mobs still has it's uses. Although I imagine you will have good reason to use either. 4 total stuns procs will carry your agro a long ways.</div></div><hr />
