<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Froggerx Xreggorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone seen this being a problem more often? I have ambidex, flurry3 and other offensive aa's aswell as my defensive ones... But regardless if I fail taunt once or twice I lose aggro to someone else.  Is there any trick to stopping, or lessening the &quot; failed taunt &quot; rate? if so, post it here for me please, also if your having this problem talk about the downsides your having with it too so I dont feel so alone with this problem. <br />

Warriors shouldn't have to say &quot; failed taunt, sorry &quot; every 10 seconds if / when we lose aggro and a rog or wiz ends up tanking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>turkishbull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yeah....Failed Taunt sucks bad.....especially when people are waiting on you to break a mezzed mob.  I fixed a chanter that way who was being a real big &quot;richard cranium&quot; one day by just hitting the mob after mez.  He got his @ss handed to him and wondered why I didnt taunt and i just said &quot;I had Failed Taunt, Sorry bud&quot;  <br />
<br />
To answer the question though, I dont think there is a way to improve the amount of successful taunts vs. failed ones.  I kinda wish there was.  Maybe im wrong though....hopefully someone can shed some more light on this matter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>irmingnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah the failed taunt dirves me crazy I am noticing that it fails more when you use Incite than you don't.  I am not to sure about this and I got to do more testing on it to verify.   It shouldn't fail as much as it do  having the skill maxxed and taunting dark blue mobs.</div></div><hr />

Why are you taunting while you still have agro.  I think the tip you need is to find out how taunt works, and how best to use it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Binnamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I spam taunt, and I am proud!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>akamek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well Froggerx you can always get that +4% taunt mod belt lol.  As for getting less failed taunts... maybe you could talk to you RNG and see if you can persuade him to be a little nicer.  Honestly there's nothing you can really do afaik to get more successful taunts.  But I looked at your magelo... and I'm not tryin to be a dick, but some haste could help a little in the aggro department.  <br />

Looking at his magelo, I spy a Shroud of the Dar Brood (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=27261).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bulbog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">With your setup and aa's you really shouldn't have any aggro problems.  The only problems I could really see our intial aggro problems(tash, slow, debuffs etc) which is fixed with a well timed taunt.  Your problem may be, like mentioned above, using taunt at the right time.  Watch for &quot;Target glances nervously about&quot; and slow messages to toss taunts in after in case you don't get those early procs off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Antaran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'm just wondering here.<br />
<br />
Has anyone parsed if Charisma, int or wis has any effect on taunt sucess rate?<br />
<br />
I have been thinking about this for a long time and have never seen this adressed here on the boards.<br />
<br />
Food for thought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I have 119 CHA with gear on (It's all about being a sexy Half Elf :p ), and if CHA affects Taunt, it's failing on me, because 2 days ago I had 10 failed taunts, yes 10, then a succesful taunt, then 5 fails... on dark blue cons on a LDoN adv... I mean... come on... 10 fails!! and what is worse, all these fails happened on more than 1 mob, so I had mobs running to the slower all over cause I was failing taunt when the mob got to camp... it was utterly stupid and I freaked out...<br />
<br />
Something else I noticed, is that I had a few times regained attention of the mob with a failed taunt... anyone else felt like that happened? Maybe it was my meeling or maybe not... but maybe a failed taunt does something else other than get on my nerves?... I really dont feel I can rely on taunt at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Valaden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The taunt skill blows, im pretty sure its the only class defining skill that fails so often. I think the most I've ever failed taunt on a single mob is 13 times. Nuff said. They badly need to put an AA in the game that gives a bonus to the taunt success rate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>akamek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">My bad Froggerx, guess there is some haste in there.... Weird I'd swear I didn't see that last night, oh well was kinda late, sorry bout that.  But anyways, taunt fails alot, just something ya gotta deal w/and hope you get lucky and that you time your taunts right, but thats already been covered. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tarvok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Something that works for me when breaking mezzes is /shield the mezzer then incite and attack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ygnir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Taunt never ever fails if you make sure you rub your belly with your left hand while holding your hand to your right ear and wriggle your fingers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Britty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">If the taunt button was fixed to be more reliable than the train wreck that it is, warriors wouldn't have needed a crutch called incite.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">my observation (especially in ldon) is that since incite was added my groupmates have conspired to abandon all restraint on timing of slows other debuffs nukes and heals. im starting to see slows land before i even make melee contact on pulls now.<br />
<br />
now there is some good some bad to this. the bad is that groupmates get agro. the good is that i can have a very quickly slowed mob and only lose agro for a swing or two which sure is a lot better than it was before incite was added when i had to give up half my hitpoints building up enough agro for the slower to be able to safely cast.<br />
<br />
i used to subscribe to the view that a successful taunt always brought you to the top of the hate list and that a taunt while you already have agro is useless. but after a long while i finally concluded that this doesnt square with experience. notably if taunt gave me max hate +1 as is often said i would expect to see a very frequent occurance of snapping agro and losing it on the very next rogue swing for a round or two. i just dont see that happening much. so ive gladly joined the ranks of the taunt mashers. i know im not politically correct on this one but it just seems to work better for me. i would be an incite masher too if it werent for the huge endurance cost associated with it.</div></div><hr />
