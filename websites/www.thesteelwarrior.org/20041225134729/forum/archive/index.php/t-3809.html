<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Korinn_emarr</div><div class="date">10-22-2003, 12:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't have it but it is on my list for something to get down the line.  Can anyone who has it verify the actual benefits of it? From my calculations you raise the cap of your stats from 280 -&gt; 305 at level 65. To break that down by stat:<br />
<br />
+25 str = +25 ATK<br />
+25 sta = ( 25 x 4 ) = 100 HP.  Since you receive 4 hps per sta over 255<br />
+25 agi = ( 25 / 8.8 ) = 2.8 AC. You get roughly 1 AC per 8.8 agi.<br />
+25 dex = ??? maybe the slight chance to proc .01% more, /shrug.<br />
<br />
So, all in all the 10 AA's it costs for PP5 = +25atk +100hp +3ac.<br />
<br />
That sound right? Can someone verify these values? Does the +25 dex really increase your chance to proc by any noticeable level?<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />

I think I got 23atk from PP5. Approximately 100hp, I didn't check close enough to be positive. The ac I discounted, though that number sounds good enough. No info on dex though, sorry.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would like to thank you for the enormous amount of info you offered here.<br />
<br />
It is an interesting question, anyone care to elaberate on the over all benifits? I have not gotten this yet, but the poster seems to have a valid concern with the slight benifit from PP</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ODB</div><div class="date">10-22-2003, 02:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, let me rephrase that.<br />
<br />
PP is not really an AA you should pass up, buddy.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If you think 100+/-hps, 2+/-AC, 25+/-ATK isn't worth 10 AA's then don't bother. Just remember that your Dex(helps with tradeskill increases) and Charisma(helps with DI proc'ing) will also cap at 305.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Korinn_emarr</div><div class="date">10-22-2003, 02:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not going to pass it up I just don't know where on my list it should be. Right now it's pretty low, spending 10 AA's for 100hp and 23atk isn't anything to write home about.<br />
<br />
I would probably rather do SE, or finish out TM before going PP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Togr</div><div class="date">10-22-2003, 02:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Depends on what signifigance you rank AAs.  I see 100hp of high importance so I'm finishing it off, but I also have my STA/STR at 50 points over the 305 cap.  After seeing myself at 280 for so long when I knew I had much higher finally got me to decide to stop wasting what I have so I raised PP up on my AA order.  Which I'm about to have finished (and last step will make me at an even 6600 which is nice too!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">10-22-2003, 03:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">100hp and 23 atk is nothing to scoff at. I did all my other defensive AAs first, then spent the 10 on PP. It also has the nice feature of being 2 points per level, so you get some very quick small results. The invisible effect of increased dex undoubtedly helps too, but that's hard to quantify.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Binnamar</div><div class="date">10-22-2003, 04:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Get your defensive aa first. Once you have that, then get PP. <br />
<br />
<br />
Or if your like me, I could care less and will probably get some fun AA after I finish all my defensive rather then for a couple of minor stat increases.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">10-22-2003, 06:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think you got those values right<br />
I personally am not doing PP untill I max all my offensive and defensive stuff maybe even get a few toys before it as well. As you pointed out 100hp and 25attack and thats with buffs unless you are uber is not a priority.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">10-22-2003, 07:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only thing Planar Power is really good for is your Magelo profile.  As long as you still have any defensive skills left to go, and that includes things like Stalwart Endurance, you're better off spending points into those than Planar Power.  Even most offensive AAs are more worthwhile than Planar Power.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">10-22-2003, 08:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah I don't plan on doing PP until I finish off Flurry 6, ambidex crits 6 and SE3.  I'll prob start working on PP after I'm around 220+ aas or so.  I'd rank it higher than innate resists and double riposte and lower than all defensive / offensives aas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">10-22-2003, 09:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh, if you think 10aas for 100hp and 25atk is a good return on the investment, you have FAR more AA's than I.  All defensive and 99% of all offensive AA's are way more useful than 10 points in that POS ability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taminy</div><div class="date">10-23-2003, 03:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Planar Power is far from stellar - that's definetly the truth. It's definetly useful, but I suppose for the people who want to purely play the numbers game it's fairly low priority. <br />
<br />
I did it just to feel completely finished with my defensive AAs though (I think I also had TM3 and SE3 at the time). Purely a psychological thing - that I was going to be able to stand up to damage the absolute best that I could from AAs (at least until the next AA set is added).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nagellom</div><div class="date">10-23-2003, 11:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did PP before I finished my defensives, been happy as hell ever since.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">10-23-2003, 11:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I found it worth the AAs for the extra 100hp. Higher end, anything that can give you more hp is pretty high up on the priority list. It's actually the only AA warriors get that's both defensive and offensive as well. Is it as good of defensive as any other defensive AAs? No. Is it as good of offensive as most offensive AAs? Nope. I got it just so I was completely done with defensive AAs forever, and for the eye candy of 305 stats.</div></div><hr />

Agility?  *crickets*<br />
<br />
Going from 280 to 305 dex might be helpful, I really don't know.  It is with fletching at least.<br />
<br />
Going from 280 to 305 charisma might be nice, but are there any warriors here who can take advantage of that?<br />
<br />
That leaves us with the 100 hps that the stamina gives us.  How much do you value 100 hps?  Personally, I did it after all defensive AA's and about halfway through offensive AA's.  I think I did PP right before going back and doing the combatfury/flurry route.<br />
<br />
P.s. stalwart endurance is really an offensive AA except in special circumstances (like getting stunned while pulling and then getting beat on more).</div></div><hr />

It has been shown that attack gained from STR doesn't significantly increase your dps.  I don't know much about the history of the discovery of it, but it is generally regarded to be true.  It's not very important though, as most people that would take the time to test such a thing have 305 str unbuffed anyways and probably got planarpower months ago.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The game's changed quite a bit since the shamans over at the cruicible did those tests.<br />
<br />
Questions you have to ask yourself ...<br />
<br />
STR ATK, how exactly is it different from worn ATK?<br />
<br />
Does STR ATK instead increase the number of max hits? Or decrease the number of min hits? If so, how's that affect the ATK rating and overall, DPS picture?<br />
<br />
But really, that is for another thread. And for another class message board, imo, heh (let the shamans deal with that jibba jabba).<br />
<br />
Planar Power, most people get, so that they max their stats. <br />
<br />
It's just an eye candy thing. And there's nothing wrong with that.<br />
<br />
Hell, stat chasing is half the reason people upgrade gear anyways.</div></div><hr />

If you are a raid warrior with a bard, yes.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Allpain</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 02:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I completed the 5 levels of PP in about a day and a half of bashing POS frogs (I had already completed the major deff. and off. AAs).  I noted an observable lessing in the amount of dmg. I took while tanking mobs.  <br />
<br />
If I had it to do over again I would have gotten PP maxed as soon as I hit level 65.  My theory is by moving the stats from 280 to 305 there is a fairly significant improvement in a tanks ability to avoid and to mitigate dmg.  I think there is something within the game code that makes this occure and is not something made evident simply from our Str, Sta, Agi, Dex, etc stats.<br />
<br />
No, I can not prove it with a parse so my opinion and 50 cents might get you cup of coffee.<br />

<br />
What are basing this on exactly? So you feel that 100 hp and 10ac allowed you to tank much better? Maybe you not talking about PoP mobs but some sebelis stuff or something because there is no way I can tell the difference of 100hp/10ac on things that hit 400-700.</div></div><hr />

Cant beat that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, actually, damned near every other thing you could buy with 10 points DOES beat that, and that's the whole point.</div></div><hr />
