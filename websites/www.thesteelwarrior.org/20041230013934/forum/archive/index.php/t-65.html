<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donnel</div><div class="date">04-17-2003, 04:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Any suggestions on my equipment? I don't have much money (most Ive had at one time was 200, but I have ways of making money if need be).<br />
<br />
I'm rather new to the whole tank thing, I mainly play casters (I have 8 characters on the nameless server, only one is less then level 20 and 5 of them are casters, the other three, a Monk, Rogue, and Donnel here)<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

Alot of people just want to get rid of there old gear fast so they sell it cheap. You may score a really nice item for 1/10th what other people sell it for.<br />
<br />
Heres what you do. Set up the search window for your race/class then set it to show item by ac or whatever stat is most important to you. Also enter the max ammount you want to spend for each item. Then just select one slot at a time and hit search and write down the top 5 choices and there price. Then do this again for each slot. Now with a little figuring out you can decide what combonation of items to buy will get you the most AC for your money. You may not be able to buy items for every slot, and dont take all day figuring this out because an item might get bought before you get to it.<br />
<br />
That is what I did for my warrior frog. All the stuff I have cost me about 25k, thats including all weapons. Click the link below to see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donnel</div><div class="date">04-17-2003, 04:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well Ive got every slot full with something that provides a stat at least, so I am probably ahead of the curve, but specifically what should I look for at which levels? I have over 500 AC at level 25, is this good? or do I need more.<br />
These are my questions really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ThornyEQ</div><div class="date">04-17-2003, 05:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just off the top of my head, and figuring a cash crunch, I'd recommend you pick yourself up the following at the bazaar:<br />
<br />
  crafted pants (the regular size has more resale value than the small, but either is cheap these days) or crustacean pants (sucky CHA, but good AC and great STA).<br />
<br />
  crafted or crustacean bp<br />
<br />
  tattered mantle for your shoulders<br />
<br />
  replace the serp bracer with another crusty or crafted bracer<br />
<br />
  replace your rings with AC 6/65 HP rings (velium fire wedding rings)<br />
<br />
I'm willing to bet you can do all that for less than 2Kpp, maybe a good bit less.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donnel</div><div class="date">04-17-2003, 05:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did you mean Crusty Legs instead of the crafted? I have a couple proccing weapons too, is the loss of dex a problem?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nevian</div><div class="date">04-17-2003, 06:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">At level 25 procing weapons is the least of your worries.  The basic formula is AC &gt; STA &gt; HP &gt; everything else, and that will hold true for you for a while.  crusty/crafted is good stuff at your level and dirt cheap.  i would just shoot for having ac and hp if ya can (either raw HP or STA) in every slot.  basically go out and whoop mob butt, your gear will improve with your level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zalgen</div><div class="date">04-17-2003, 06:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Buy crafted / crusty gear.  Basically interchangeable.  And that stuff is cheap now.  I quested all of it and sold it all around 50 relatively quick and very reasonable.  Now that's too weak for 50 but then... Basically I'm saying it's gear you can get some mileage out of.<br />
<br />
Get some AC rings too.  Jagged bands are like a dime a dozen (pick up 10AC for like 25pp) if your real tight or just have a jewler friend make you some Velium Fire Wedding Rings (6 AC / 65HP).<br />
<br />
Worry about Dex later...  focus on AC if your tankin'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ThornyEQ</div><div class="date">04-17-2003, 08:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I meant get crusty or crafted legs; your Magelo shows you using feathered leggings. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbo Baggins</div><div class="date">04-18-2003, 12:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">at 25 1 sta=2 hp so it would be ac&gt;hp&gt;sta</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donnel</div><div class="date">04-18-2003, 10:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">When I origonally purchased stuff for Donnel here, I bought his entire set for &lt; 700P so the feathered ended up being one of the last things I bought (I figured, I don't have that much money so +7 STA was okay for 20P)<br />
<br />
<br />
Ive upgraded a few pieces as money comes in (I gotta earn it now) And Ive bought a few more weapons for kicks and grins. (I like the /boggles as I switch around two or three weapons in a fight, walking arsenal)<br />
<br />
Thanks for the suggestions, the idea that stat1&gt;stat2&gt;stat3 is new to me since I mostly play a caster (int/mana&gt;all) <br />
<br />
I will look around and see what I can find. Got two levels in Sol A last night, and around 90P for my troubles, so Ive got a bit o' cash now.</div></div><hr />
