<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kjelrod</div><div class="date">12-06-2004, 12:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a lvl 64 troll warrior who sits at like 6.8k hp with a Kazad, Pot 9, Fo7 and a Stamina.......  weapons are Copper Hammer and a Sword of Bloodsworn.  Gear is decent will link it if i figure out how.......<br />
<br />
Now my problem...... I would one day love to get to lvl 70 but i am not sure what all i have to do before i get there...... I only have like 7 aa's regen and STA and i have started doing those again until i get a plan for my next few lvls.... I know i need more HP but i only have like 10-12 hours a week to  play and it is only on weekends.  I have thought about LDoN and I have heard it takes forever to do too.  I ooc'd one time and had a lvl 70 warrior try to set me straight but all he did was inspect me and tell me i need to get 120 aa's then hit lvl 65 then do LDoN till i am blue in the face........... at my playing rate I could be 70 i about 10 years....... please send me some direction if you can...keep in mind my time is not eternal.....thanks guys</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tooby</div><div class="date">12-06-2004, 12:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I play about the same as you, little less at the moment, maybe 8 hrs. 6.4k is a little low, but  i believe i was at your stage in September (4k unbuffed at 64) and have added just short of 2k hp, 20aa and 2 levels since (6000 unbuffed) (V + Shield of the Arcane *from the ornate bp = 8100hp, 1450ac - so still not great but at least nowadays very few rangers and monks suggest they should tank.<br />
<br />
I would suggest, and this isnt exactly brilliant but it worked. <br />
<br />
Do a few Ldons - just for the anger augs and maybe some AC augs. Might as well do it now you will acctually start getting less points per win for normal (which i think is what you want to tank) as you get into higher level groups. Secondly, while ldon xp is bad at 64 - it just gets worse, so now is the time.<br />
<br />
Try making or getting some OOW groups, pray for a few decent drops (if you have a bard or ranger friend who can snag the names that really helps). If possible trade the runes.<br />
<br />
Set up a trader. If you only play say 10% of the hours in a week, but are on cable, keep a trader up the remaining 90%. If you do some research, you will find some good deals eventually. Bazaar up your gear.<br />
<br />
Sadly this is not very inspirational. The other option is of course to make a toon that is better suited to casual play, but once you get into warrioring, it can be hard to turn back..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">12-07-2004, 03:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">rule #1 : don't lvl to 70 now ! stop at lvl 65<br />
reason : a lvl 70 war without 100AA sucks, and at lvl 70 there is fewer hunting zone, and you won't find any LDoN group at lvl 70. Much of lvl 65 zones are getting fewer people now so it's harder for LFG people, but it's a great time for you to hunt if you have friends, and if you don't it will give you some (hunting allways with the same people because there is noone else...).<br />
rule #2 : you need aggro aug for tanking, since you have few time to spent, coose the Ykesha aug since they are cheaper than A3 and they are comparable aggro (a bit less of course but still very ok). you will need enougth points for 2 (ideally 3) ykesha slot 4 then reimbourse them and buy back 2 (ideally 3) type 8 when you will use OoW and GoD weapons. Thus bank LDoN points now that you can hunt there because after it will more difficult. So in summary, LDoN are a forced zone for us because it's the only way to get aggro aug. But all the other aug (HP, AC, stats, ...) can drop in GoD and OoW (they are even better on hard mob), so if you don't like LDoN just get your ykesha and run away.<br />
<br />
rule #3 : post your magelo, to do so easily past the link line of the web page of your magelo directly in  the post, like this http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?p=152633#post152633<br />
<br />
rule #4 : have fun ! it's more important than lvling when you don't have 35H+ to spent on EQ !<br />
<br />
rule #5 : OoW is great for exp, loot and fun but remember that you need 50AA before getting lvl 66 (you can do without but it won't be fun).</div></div><hr />
