<br />
First I would like to say, that it is GREAT to see you all posting and participating on these boards. It means a lot more than you may realize,  the fealings of being ignored were getting to a fever pitch here after months and months of apparent abandonment hurt a lot  of people, and lowered expectations greatly that we would  ever get some attention.<br />
<br />
The two questions I have.<br />
<br />
1.) Innate HP advantage for warriors. This started with original Everquest, The actual numerical difference has remained pretty much consistent, however the percentage of our HP advantage has decreased dramatically. Is there any plan to restore the original advantage?<br />
<br />
<br />
2.) Itemization. Is there any plan to change/fix the current or future itemization of equipment in the game? The current policy of all/all and all plate has also tended to benefit the caster classes and hybrids more than the pure melees.<br />
<br />
Any comments or opinions on this would be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know you read this board enough to remember = p</div></div><hr />
