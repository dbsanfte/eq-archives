<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ironblood Spillmore</div><div class="date">07-18-2004, 03:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">After having read these boards for a few years, I'm finally to the point where I need some advice as I'm undecided which way I should head with my char. Here's what he looks like currently:<br />
<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=147884<br />
<br />
His HP isn't bad, around 9600 buffed up, but his ac with tribute barely tops 1850. He is elemental flagged, but he's also my twink (of many years) so gets basically no chance at any raid droppable gear. Also, in 40+ raid strength situations he's normally not called on to tank unless all the other tanks die.<br />
<br />
Will LDoN armor be the best way to raise his AC short term? Keep in mind any thing that would be obtainable by him would have to be single groupable or purchasable.<br />
<br />
Any comments on gear, AA, Leader, weapons etc would be welcome!<br />

<br />
To be honest, I'm not sure how you can improve your AC at this point.  You are pretty much at the end of the line in terms of non-raid AC.  LDON will be a downgrade.  Most elemental would be a downgrade for AC too, for that matter.<br />
<br />
Farming Ferubi or Kod'Taz for AC augments seems like the best idea to me.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, AC augments look like your best bet (which it looks like you've already started).  It's possible VP might change that...but I don't know as much will be duoable in there with the revamp...risk vs. reward for upgrades of your gear seem to pretty much point towards raid drops I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Svan</div><div class="date">07-18-2004, 07:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">RA would still be a small upgrade for ac and hp, but not much</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">oomwarrior</div><div class="date">07-18-2004, 08:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1st of all....   I HATE JOO  gimme my mask:D  been looking for that mask for as long as i can remember playing a war;p<br />
<br />
hum... well lets see.  considering you are in elem guild with elem friends...   <br />
<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1049387<br />
<br />
Doze neck<br />
Doze bracer<br />
GoS earring<br />
another earth ring<br />
deepflame would help with other stats. but not so much on the AC department<br />
and yah scalecracker IF you can find 1.  it's just as rare as your mask so good luck:)<br />
<br />
and yellowfang ear IF you are willing to cough up hp's to use it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nazak</div><div class="date">07-18-2004, 08:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's some ideas:<br />
-Earring of Veracity.  (I think you could do it with a group or two, assuming you can get a lot of pet classes to kill the praesertums.)<br />
<br />
-Turepta ring in the Lair sewer trial.<br />
<br />
-Bracer from the ring of slime.  (Should be single group, no problem.)<br />
<br />
-Bracer from Mir hard ldon...might be called &quot;mana threaded bracer&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Argin</div><div class="date">07-19-2004, 12:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For AC it seems that you can get one of your biggest upgrades in the neck slot, with just 3 AC on it unaged there's a lot of items you could get with one group for little or no hp trade off.  Seru toruqe, amulet of the dreadgazer, necklace of the troglodyte from hard EC ldons, silver charm of tranquility, probably quite a few others.<br />
<br />
edit- I'm in about the same boat as you, good AC is pretty hard to come buy pre-EP or VT, other possibilites for upgrades could be Seru BP, SBoS, Polished Garnet Loop or Purified Steel Earring for ear.   Getting a BF would be hard with one group but you can do AL (very slowly) for a chance at a HG.  You have a lot of options for range if youre willing to get rid of bow, scalecracker is good but rare and also type4, Carved Vrex Totem, Marsinger gems 3 and 4, Charm of Defense, and Secret of the Planes are all type7 ranges you can pop a Faceted Gem of Might or other aug into.</div></div><hr />
