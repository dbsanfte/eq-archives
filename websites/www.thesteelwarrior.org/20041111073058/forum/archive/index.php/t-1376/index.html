<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>QuirtEvans</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Looking at posts recently, I'm absolutely amazed at the obsession with HP among the warrior community.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I agree that HP are crucially important.  But the focus on HP to the point of ignoring every single other stat seems to me misguided.  <br />
<br />
With the arrival of PoP, AC has become critically important once again.  Pre-PoP, there was an argument that there was a &quot;soft cap&quot; on AC.  Whether that was true or not pre-PoP, it's certainly not true in the PoP zones, it's been demonstrated that very high AC continues to provide benefits versus PoP mobs.   <br />
<br />
One recent example of the obsession with HP was when someone said that they wouldn't wear a stone visor because it doesn't have any HP on it.  Excuse me?  20 AC, 10 STR, 10 AGI, a couple of decent sized saves, all in the face slot, and you'd wear something with much less AC and substantially smaller stats because it has a few HP?  That seems silly to me.  <br />
<br />
What you need depends on how you play the game.  I two-box quite a lot with a shammy.  When I am two-boxing, it doesn't matter whether I have 3K, 5K, or 10K HP .. because my shammy's cheal is only 1800.  Really, the place I need the extra HP is on the shammy, because the warrior never, ever dies unless the shammy dies first.  When two-boxing with a shammy, damage avoidance, damage mitigation, and more DPS are all more valuable to a warrior than more HPs.  <br />
<br />
And if your AGI is under 120, goosing your AGI over 120 would be far, far more valuable than those last few HPs, because of the way AGI and AC interact when health starts to get low.<br />
<br />
Yes, more HP is better.  All else equal.  Heck, HP may even be more important than any other single stat.  But the singleminded pursuit of HP without considering the effect of each piece of equipment on all of your other stats is stupid.  It's a multi-variable analysis, and it needs to be treated that way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Think thats your problem.<br />
<br />
Group Exp usually (not always) revolves around cleric CH.  You try to minimize the amount of times the cleric has to CH.  Less CH's means less downtime.<br />
<br />
Thus HP &gt;&gt; All.  The more you got, the more efficient the whole group becomes.  I mean yeah Id take a +20 AC improvement if it lowers my HP's only 10 HPs but usually I go to Max HP gear.  <br />
<br />
AC does little against PoP Mob Hits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well lets suppose the gain from AC are linear.<br />
<br />
And that +100ac (raw) will give you -5% DPS on mob dps.<br />
(Parses tend to indicate something near that number with<br />
some diminishing returns on XP mobs, no info on gods yet)<br />
Please note again this could be generous, but 2-5% is reasonable.<br />
I chose 5% to make a point.<br />
<br />
<br />
Let us compare 3 rings :<br />
<br />
AoW : ac30 hp100<br />
Algae : ac10 hp135<br />
Moss : ac18 hp145<br />
<br />
Which of the 3 is better ? Well lets take a look :<br />
For a 9000hp full buffed warrior wanting a new ring<br />
(Items give +50%ac as normal bonus, and +17%hp as AA bonus)<br />
<br />
AoW will give :  45ac and 117hp<br />
Algae will give : 15ac and 158hp<br />
Moss will give : 27ac and 164hp<br />
<br />
So <br />
AoW = 9000+117hp AND 45ac<br />
Algae = 9000+158hp AND 15ac<br />
Moss = 9000+164hp AND 27ac<br />
<br />
But how do we take into account the AC gain ?<br />
As we saw before  100ac = -5% dps, lets assume again that<br />
lowering the mobs DPS by 5%, is equivalent to having 5% more hp.<br />
(I know it doesnt work like exactly that but lets assume it)<br />
<br />
AoW = 9117 x 0.45 x 5% = 205 hp<br />
Algae = 9158 x 0.15 x 5% = 69 hp<br />
Moss = 9164 x 0.24 x 5% = 110 hp<br />
<br />
This means, that AoW will give you 205 &quot;Virtual HP&quot; because of its ac.<br />
If you want to &quot;translate 30ac&quot; for the 9000hp warrior its equivalent to 205hp.<br />
So ac30 100hp  =   ac0  305hp statwise (assuption of course)<br />
<br />
So the Final Comparaison for the 3 rings on a 9000hp fully buffed warrior<br />
That is looking for a ring is :<br />
<br />
AoW = 305 hp gained (real &amp; virtual)<br />
Aglae = 227 hp gained (real &amp; virtual)<br />
Moss = 274 hp gained (real &amp; virtual)<br />
<br />
Remember this is based on 2 very big assumptions :<br />
*  +100 ac = -5% dps taken<br />
*  -5% dps taken = +5% hp (virtual hp of course)<br />
<br />
<br />
Now the choice between AC &amp; HP is delicate. You need both<br />
because some mobs will just SHRED you with low ac.<br />
But HP will help you take hits.<br />
<br />
In the end i tend to believe that as your max hp above 9K buffed<br />
Ac becomes much much appealing for 2 reasons<br />
<br />
- You gain a LOT more &quot;Virtual HP&quot; from dps reduction<br />
(Thats if you believe  DPS reduction = Virtual HP gain)<br />
<br />
- AC helps a LOT reducing max hits (spikes) and spikes are killers in PoP<br />
(see ainian's parses on xegony, and chatja's ?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The reason hps are more important than other stats is that hps arent capped, stats are. At 65, with planar power, the highest stats you can have are 305. The highest hps you can have at that level has no limit, so whats more important, higher unbuffed stats or higher buffed hps?<br />
<br />
You especially 2 boxing a shaman should be the last to worry about other stats. Focus line, agi, sta, boom, maxxed stats or close enough that it isnt a worry.<br />
<br />
With the damage dealt by mobs in pop, unless you have super high ac, i dont see it having as big an impact on day to day playing than having more hps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">With a shaman as main healer, total HP dont really matter.<br />
Since his CH will always hit for full. <br />
Thus your goal should be to minimise the dmg taken.<br />
<br />
With a cleric as main healer, total HP do matter a lot.<br />
Since his CH will almost never hit for full.<br />
Thus your goal should be to maximise total HP (CH efficiency)<br />
<br />
But on the long run, going for high HP &amp; high AC is solution.<br />
<br />
Since when you start raiding, you will want to<br />
* Lower the mobs DPS (by gaining ac, thus &quot;virtual hp&quot;)<br />
* Boost your HP (to have more room for error &amp; slower CH lines)<br />
<br />
Your case is special, since you use a ghetto CH as reference.<br />
<br />
<br />
Stats have ZERO importance (very easy to raise, miniman impact)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grimmlokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Smart people focus on HP because HP always matters. AC only matter when you're directly tanking, HP's on the other hand absorb AE damage quite nicely. Plus you can see what they do, there's zero randomness to the impact of HP's. 100hp's is going to let you absorb 100 more points of damage. Period. People like that.<br />
<br />
 However, I am curious where you're getting the impression that people are all gung-ho to sacrifice AC for HP. Since this board has generally come to the concensus that AC is indeed very useful in PoP, like months ago.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's what I was thinking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Also, hps are more important than AC when you have a CH chain aimed at you for a raid target. Usually CH chains are tuned to take into account the worst case scenario, which is the same regardless of AC level. The only thing that can really change the timing of a CH chain for a given mob is size of the HP pool of the tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">But CH lands for 7500 hp unless it's a crit nowdays, meaning that a 9k+ warrior will have a 1500-2000 point reserve above a CH.<br />
<br />
I dont' advocate anything that's knee-jerk, i.e. HP &gt; all in every circumstance, or AC &gt; all in every circumstance, or any other nonsense.<br />
<br />
For instance, during Luclin/Velious, the Vindi BP was seen as the premier BP barring Seru/AHR BP's.   This was due to the lessenned utility of AC, and the effect of +Atk.<br />
<br />
This is no longer the case... Kizrak's BP is significantly better than Vindi BP precisely because it's almost 20AC more, as well as 15hp.   The effect is far less meaningful nowdays than it used to be because of fight durations, and I'd go so far as arguing that Eradication has increased in value as well, to be about equal with Vindi BP because of the short nature of PoP fights and the limited value of + Atk in short duration fights.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Zakneffan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'm always going to be hp &gt; all in my mind set, the smallest amount of HP can save your life and make a difference between getting res or a complete heal, I was at 0% on my health bar and got a complete heal just cuz I had like 1 hp left =P I know ac can do the same but what's better, to have a weak organ and strong casing of bone to protect it, or to have a decently strong bone casing, and have a stronger organ inside so it can withstand a beating. I know bizarre comparison but I'm kind of drunk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Mandragor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">HP is the universal &quot;I-ain't-gonna-see-'LOADING, PLEASE WAIT'-yet&quot; stat, whether you're getting beat, nuked, DoTed, etc.  Thus, its utility is far and away more useful and prominent than AC and its cousin, resists.  Sure, you'd be stupid to go without respectable AC and resists, but HP determine how many of those &quot;decreased&quot; hits you can take before the cleric has to prop up the meatshield.<br />
<br />
My opinion, of course.  I'll leave the comparisons of what equals what to people with way more patience and parsing time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gunrack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'll give you the view on this from a &quot;non-ubber&quot; small guild of casual players.  HP is a very big deal because for us breaking the 1250 mark on AC isn't that realistic.. buffed maybe.. of course we can still shoot to have that unbuffed.. but after that.. all hp's.. avaliable through tradeskills or by just farming PP.<br />
<br />
So for the small scope of everquest &quot;casual&quot; gaming HP is a very important stat =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">&quot;At 65, with planar power, the highest stats you can have are 305.&quot;<br />
<br />
Which means stats are important until you cap them right? A lot of people haven't capped them, even with buffs.<br />
<br />
I was talking to my guild leader the other day (he's also our guild MT) and he was talking about being able to swap some STA gear out for HP gear. My reply was, &quot;Is your STA 305 yet? NO? Then you're still need STA gear.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sure it was flip. But the point remains the same. Everyone likes to say that past 255 you don't get as big a return on STA hps. But let's not kid ourselves ... even at 1hp per STA point, it's 1 more hit point.<br />
<br />
So STA remains important until 305. Just like AC remains important. Just like Hit Points remain important.<br />
<br />
NONE of these stats are UNIMPORTANT as you develop your character. It's sort of the point.<br />
<br />
&quot; The highest hps you can have at that level has no limit, so whats more important, higher unbuffed stats or higher buffed hps?&quot;<br />
<br />
Hit Points certainly do have a limit.<br />
<br />
The limit is what's attainable by the gear. 305 is the stat cap, and that's easy to see because everyone can see it and get it. But there is a finite amount of gear with finite amounts of statistics available. Which means there is indeed a hit points hard cap.<br />
<br />
Just like there's a hard cap on Armor class one can attain.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;But CH lands for 7500 hp unless it's a crit nowdays, meaning that a 9k+ warrior will have a 1500-2000 point reserve above a CH.&quot;<br />
<br />
I tend to take the opposite stance. Since the spell is finite now, the added HPs are less useful since a tank can still do the job with less hit points. The added hit points aren't really doing much there.<br />
<br />
But I'm in complete agreement with this:<br />
<br />
&quot;I dont' advocate anything that's knee-jerk, i.e. HP &gt; all in every circumstance, or AC &gt; all in every circumstance, or any other nonsense.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stats are stats. Gear is gear. You can't just make one universal truth that X will always be better than Y for EQ equipment.<br />
<br />
It all depends on what drops, and then when it drops where exactly you are with your own gear and effectiveness (as well as your friends/guildmates).<br />
<br />
Hit points are very important. For sure.<br />
<br />
But so are all the other stats.<br />
<br />
People must remember that by the time you're maxxing out your combat stats to 305 ... you're obviously wearing gear and using items that have a LOT of AC and Hit Points on them. It all goes hand in hand.<br />
<br />
Occasionally there's odd little quirks, like the Shaderock Amulet (sure, 100 hit points, really nifty, but a measly THREE AC? Is it really all that much better than a Glimmering Mithril Torque? Well, that depends really on you and your gear at the time).<br />
<br />
But for the most part the 100+ HP items have pretty good AC and stats to go with them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>QuirtEvans</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">To those who wonder where I got the impression that the warrior community is obsessed with HPs, I got this impression from several threads, the gist of which is, &quot;Don't use that high AC item, it has no HP on it, use this low AC item with some HP!&quot;  There's a few quotes in this thread that seem to say that very thing.<br />
<br />
I understand the idea about the relationship of HPs to cheals, really I do.  I only mention the two-boxing situation because it's a case where you have to think about how you play the game, and not mindlessly go along with the crowd on what is most important.<br />
<br />
More HPs mean you can take more hits, true.  But more AC may also mean you can take more hits, if it lowers the average value of the hit.   Even if you have a cleric chealing you, there is some tradeoff between AC and HP .. there is some point at which lowering the damage you take is better than increasing the pool of HP against which damage is calculated.  What that tradeoff is, I don't know.  But certainly 50 AC &gt; 1 HP, and 50 HP &gt; 1 AC.  So we can all agree, I think, that there is a point where one or the other is optimal, it's just a question of where that point is.  Conventional wisdom used to say 1 AC was roughly equivalent to 10 HP, but I get the impression that many warriors seem to think that 10 HP is worth more than 1 AC these days. <br />
<br />
Let me respond to a few things:<br />
<br />
----------<br />
<br />
&quot;Stats have ZERO importance (very easy to raise, miniman impact)&quot;<br />
<br />
Sorry, but I don't agree.  DEX is critically important when you are using a proccing weapon.  If you don't believe me, do some parses with DEX of around 150, and then with an enchanter casting NDT on you.  Your proc rate will go way up.  Proc rate may not affect your defensive abilities, but it will sure as hell affect your tanking abilities.  You need to be able to hold aggro, and procs (depending on the proc) can help you do that.  As I told a warrior in my guild comparing a low ratio weapon with lots of HP with a better ratio weapon with no HPs, it really doesn't matter how many HPs you have if the mob isn't hitting you.  <br />
<br />
---------<br />
<br />
&quot;Less CH's means less downtime.  Thus HP &gt;&gt; All. The more you got, the more efficient the whole group becomes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Less cheals does mean less downtime, but that doesn't necessarily mean that HP &gt;&gt; All.  More AC can mean less cheals, which can also mean less downtime.  Assuming that more AC means more damage mitigation, of course.  <br />
<br />
-------------<br />
<br />
&quot;With the damage dealt by mobs in pop, unless you have super high ac, i dont see it having as big an impact on day to day playing than having more hps.&quot;<br />
<br />
I don't agree with that either.  As the hits get bigger, anything that can mitigate the size of the hits potentially becomes even more important, because a small percentage mitigation winds up translating into a bigger raw number of HP mitigation.  If more AC actually mitigates more damage, that is.<br />
<br />
---------  <br />
<br />
&quot;I dont' advocate anything that's knee-jerk, i.e. HP &gt; all in every circumstance, or AC &gt; all in every circumstance, or any other nonsense.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now THAT I agree with.<br />
<br />
------------<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;AC does little against PoP Mob Hits.&quot;<br />
<br />
Not in my experience, and not according to the parses posted on this board.<br />
<br />
------------<br />
<br />
&quot;I am curious where you're getting the impression that people are all gung-ho to sacrifice AC for HP. Since this board has generally come to the concensus that AC is indeed very useful in PoP, like months ago.&quot;<br />
<br />
It isn't much of a consensus if people are still saying things like &quot;AC does little against PoP Mob Hits.&quot;<br />
<br />
-----------<br />
<br />
&quot;The reason hps are more important than other stats is that hps arent capped, stats are. At 65, with planar power, the highest stats you can have are 305. The highest hps you can have at that level has no limit, so whats more important, higher unbuffed stats or higher buffed hps?&quot;<br />
<br />
That's true once your stats are maxxed with raid buffs, but mine aren't, and my equipment isn't all that terrible.  It's not elemental gear, but it isn't cobalt either.  <br />
<br />
I do agree that, once your stats are maxxed with buffs for your ordinary fighting situation, a stat that has no cap becomes very attractive.  That said, neither AC nor HP caps.  <br />
<br />
--------------<br />
<br />
&quot;AC only matter when you're directly tanking, HP's on the other hand absorb AE damage quite nicely.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fair point, but the logical extension of that point is that HP is resist gear.  When you are MT, which is better, AC or HP?  That's the question I was asking, although your clarification is reasonable.<br />
<br />
--------------<br />
<br />
&quot;you can see what they do, there's zero randomness to the impact of HP's. 100hp's is going to let you absorb 100 more points of damage. Period. People like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yeah, but that is a very unsophisticated analysis.  That's like saying HP is better than resists against an AoE mob because you can't directly see what the resists do for you.  I'm not saying you believe that, of course, but it is a very logical reason why some people who don't want to think too hard might prefer HP.  Myself, I can live without seeing a one-for-one relationship, if it can be demonstrated that another stat is more valuable.<br />
<br />
-------------<br />
<br />
&quot;Usually CH chains are tuned to take into account the worst case scenario, which is the same regardless of AC level.&quot;<br />
<br />
If it's a first time mob, true.  If it's a mob you've fought before, hopefully you have some sense of how often it hit for max damage against your MT, and you can tune your CH chain accordingly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For any bona fide 'Guild Main Tank', ie someone who tanks regularly on a raid and isnt just the guy who gets hit in an exp group, the tradeoff is actually<br />
<br />
&quot;Assuming all other stats are equal,will the raw HP gained from this item offset and overtake the the loss in HP from the stamina on my previous item, taking into account the diminishing returns of sta above 255, the hard cap of 305, and finally that on a raid I will be bufed 99.99% of the time with Boar if I want&quot;<br />
<br />
If the net HP gain is greater from raw HP over sta, then go for it.<br />

IMO, Sta at 305 unbuffed is useless, if you are always buffed when it matters.</div></div><hr />

Who do you think will last longer in a boss mob fight . . . <br />
<br />
Warrior X with 255/305 and say +1400 HP's unbuffed or<br />
Warrior Y with 305/305 with +1200 HP's unbuffed? <br />
<br />
Warrior X DID NOT max out his stam gear, instead he opted for +HP gear.  Warrior Y went for all out +stam gear and doesnt have all the good +HP stuff.<br />
<br />
Warrior X with stat buffs from a shammy will have about 1400 + 150 from the additional stamina = +1550 (assuming 3hp per 1 stam after 255)<br />
<br />
Warrior Y is maxed stam already so he cant get any buffs from a shaman (stam wise).  Thus he's still at +1200 HP's<br />
<br />
Warrior X has a 350HP advantage over Warrior Y, thus making +HP gear better over stam.<br />

Well he's not at 305 BUFFED yet, let alone unbuffed. Can't check magelo at work, or I'd get the exact stat. So he's got some ways to go. Which was the context of my response to him in our little chat.<br />

<br />
Depends on the fight. But generally, they are interchangable due to the nature of the heal chain. On some boss mobs you cold insert a druid or an enchanter for this very reason.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Xath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">On the whole hp/ac/stmaina thing my view is simple.  for me 1ac = 1 stamina = 5 hp.  I did a little math to get there based on mitigation trends for ac as posted here in a couple of places, my max hp, and the fact that I am a DE who usually doesn't have a shaman around (and almost never one over 60).  For me it just really isn't worth any more effort than this simple comparison.  If you don't know where to go with your own ac/hp choices you might wanna try something similar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">With the parses so far, it basically figures out one displayed (not raw AC, i.e. 45 AC on Vindi BP) is about 5 HP for a 9k HP warrior (it's slightly more... probably closer to 6 in reality).  <br />
<br />
You're a warrior, not a wizard.  If you're worried about HPs to survive some AE then something is really wrong.  If people with considerably less HP can survive on the AEs that are mostly unavoidable and unresistable (Fire/Water) then so can you.<br />
<br />
And for tanking, no CH chain is ever prepared for the worst case scenario because the worst case scenario is you getting one rounded by a mob and the end.  Since the chance to be get one rounded is roughly n^2 to n^3 (it certainly takes at least two high hits to one round a warrior) this basically means the chance of you getting one rounded drops off very rapidly as you increase AC, far faster than the increased chance of getting one rounded due to HP which is roughly linear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Icebladee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Sorry, but I don't agree. DEX is critically important when you are using a proccing weapon. If you don't believe me, do some parses with DEX of around 150, and then with an enchanter casting NDT on you. Your proc rate will go way up <br />
<br />
it has been my experence that due to the fact it adds a proc, the NDT proc rate over rights the proc rate of your weps.  so if u use a bloodfrenzy and get NDT for the dex, unless the proc rate of NDT is better then bloodfrenzy the +dex will not matter.<br />
<br />
i try to stay away from all chanter forms when i MT for an xp group.  i seem to get less GSoT procs.  this was tested with tricksters (sp).  <br />

That's more DPS. Not much more, granted. But more. <br />

A very stupid example, since the toon in question is already dead.<br />
<br />
Howbout one a bit more useful? Like who would live longer, a tank with 1200 HPs fighting a boss mob, or a tank with 5000 HPs?<br />

The answer lies in when the CH is going to actually land. Because BOTH can do the job effectively if the healing power can handle it.</div></div><hr />

That factor usually has a point of no return, no return = dead tank.<br />

Even tho some might be over doing it yes by saying yey I have 2k hp's left everytime CH lands... yet another tank can do he same with only 500hps left.  This in my eyes is true.

I challenge you to show me a Magelo with a 32,000 hit point warrior.<br />
<br />
Because if there's no cap, this ought to be possible, correct?<br />
<br />
Or, is it as I stated much earlier in this thread ... there IS even a hit point cap, which is determined by the gear that's available in the game, which is a finite pool of items and stat boosters?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>QuirtEvans</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">What we have here is failure to communicate.<br />
<br />
Snoggy isn't talking about a coded HP cap, like the cap on STR or STA.  He's talking about a HP cap *in practice* .. even if it is theoretically possible to go aboce a certain level in HP, in practice you can't get there because of gear and buffs available.  <br />
<br />
A HP cap in practice is far more likely to get raised than a hard coded HP cap.  To change a cap in practice, all you have to do is add a new item to the game, as opposed to the coding changes necessary if you are raising a hard coded stat cap.  They add new items to the game all the time, they raise hard coded stat caps only rarely (and only in connection with a couple of expansions, I think).<br />
<br />
AC is pretty much in the same boat as HP with respect to caps *in practice* ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Binnamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">The way I see it is that HP gives you a greater room for error.<br />
<br />
Let's face it, nothing is perfect. Healers fizzle, healers have lag spikes and what not. Having more and more HP means a greater room for error. Sure, you can tank A LOT of things with 6200hp, but doesn't having 7k-8k hp make everything a hell of a lot easier?<br />
<br />
/shrug, I'm one of those people that want a lot of HP. AC is nice, but since I'm not in a break-neck guild ac past 1300 doesn't effect me much. HP past 6200 does though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Who cares if someone would rather use one high HP piece over one high AC piece?  It's one piece.  It's not like you can find (or would use) 10 items that are 100 hps but only 5 or 10 AC.  The bottom line is that you can't choose to overload on one or the other because, as you progress through the game, they start to even out ... and that goes for the stats too.  How many 10k tanks aren't in the neighborhood of 1900 AC or more?  Probably none.  <br />
<br />
Now, I know there are very few 10k tanks compared to the rest of the population.  However, do you think a Shaderock Amulet over a Glimmering Mithril Torque (or vice versa) is going to make a difference in any of your encounters over an extended period of time?  No, it won't.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First:<br />
<br />
difference in any of your encounters over an extended period of time? No, it won't.<br />
<br />
Yes.  Because it will.  I've been saved by a heal with &lt;200 hp left so many times, twice today in fact.<br />
<br />
Second:  Its 6 hp per sta until 255, then it drops to like 4 or 5 or some shit I don't remember.<br />
<br />
Third:  The word &quot;stat&quot; includes resists, base stats (str sta agi etc etc etc. . .), raw HP and raw AC, and attack.  That said, HP is the single most important stat for a warrior, and either the most or second most important stat for any other class.<br />
<br />
It was mentioned earlier in this thread, but I'll make this as simple as I can since people can't grasp this concept in their preaching of AC is God:<br />
<br />
THERE ARE MANY MORE WAYS TO TAKE DAMAGE THEN FROM PHYSICAL MELEE CONTACT, AND AC --ONLY-- MITIGATES DAMAGE TAKEN FROM PHYSICAL MELEE HITS<br />
<br />
Falling damage, AE spells, direct damage spells, drowning, burning, damage shields, damage over time.  These are the things that kill.  All the AC in the world doesn't save my ass if General Reparm procs four times on me in the span of 2 seconds.  It doesn't save me from taking 2000 AE damage from The Wise.<br />
<br />
The returns on AC as it increases, as opposed to the benefits of HP as it increases isn't as noticable.  Give me an extra 300 hp instead of 100 more AC anyday.</div></div><hr />

<br />
While if you didn't have that +150 HP item you would've died the time when you got a heal with 100 HP and you can see that, but what you don't see is that suppose your BP lost 50 AC and had the same stats you'd have been dead even with that extra 150 HP.<br />
<br />
Every time some elemental mob hits me for 500 that hit could've been a 500, a 1000, or 3000.  I don't know what it would have been but I can tell you that it doesn't take very many 3000 hits that I fail to mitigate to kill me.  The fact that tanks are even alive is because their AC are converting many 3000 max hits into numbers that are much more manageable.  If there is no meaningful mitigation, elemental mobs can do 10K in one round without breaking a sweat and all the HP you can stockpile won't save you from getting one-rounded.  <br />
<br />
1 displayed AC = 5-6 HP is a very accurate translator between AC and HP when dealing with 9k+ HP warriors.  While there's rarely a choice like say an item with 50 AC and 0 HP versus an item with 0 AC and 150 HP, it is still helpful to know how much AC is worth because for example 30 AC 100 HP would be beter than 15 AC 145 HP and such scenarios are not rare.</div></div><hr />

A perfect example of AC/HP tradeoff for non-ubers is the glimmering mithril torque vs. the clattering bone necklace.  Or, if you want to throw yet another stat into the mix, the tracking wolf collar.  All three are droppable, so you really can choose among them.<br />
<br />
Will any single one of those choices make a huge difference?  No.  But add them up with similar choices in other slots, and suddenly you are making a real difference.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">I suppose I'll put it another way.<br />
<br />
If someone claims that a single stat is always more important than another, they're probably wrong and should be dismissed.<br />
<br />
There's different areas of this game, and there's times when one thing is more important than others.<br />
<br />
For instance:<br />
<br />
AC is less relevant against mobs in PoP that have an innate proc than those that have only high melee.<br />
<br />
This does NOT mean that because those mobs exist, that AC is worthless or unimportant.   It DOES mean that if you spend a majority of your time fighting such mobs, then you will probably see a greater benefit from hitpoints as opposed to AC.  You may not though... <br />
<br />
Let's say this mob has an innate proc which isn't affected by AC *and* fairly heavy melee as well.   The combination of the two can kill you... at this point, minimizing one of the two attack types could be superior to simply piling on the hitpoints if it's possible to minimize one without minimizing the other.   Is the innate proc resistable?  Well hell, if that's the case, then resists &gt; hitpoints on that mob.   <br />
<br />
When Cursed wasn't trivial.... I used to sacrifice a LOT of hitpoints AND AC to get my disease resist up.... and kicked his ass every time wearing indicolite boots and those gloves from Fungus Grove and a few other things.   Resists were significantly &gt; HP *and* AC on that mob before level 65 and multi bard songs and tribunal buffs.... FOR ME.<br />
<br />
There is NO WAY that one can say that &quot;every time such and such is better than such and such&quot; unless you're talking about adding on stats that are maxed.<br />
<br />
A good rule of thumb is this:<br />
<br />
Until you close in on 1250AC, then AC is probably going to have more of an effect on you than anything else.    <br />
<br />
Once you near that point, then you can start thinking about swapping in some hitpoints and trying to balance things out.<br />
<br />
Don't go overboard with hitpoints at the expense of AC and you'll be fine.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Sterix_VA</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">About swapping stamina out for raw hps:<br />
<br />
I am not yet 305 unbuffed, not even 270 (my current cap) with normal buffs.<br />
<br />
However, if I have sta item that gives 100hps from stamina (for example bracelet of fortitude gives me about that), I would swap it to +100 raw hps with otherwise identical stats anytime.<br />
Why? 2 reasons...<br />
<br />
1) I  have same unbuffed hps, yet I can get theoretically much better buffed hps (can get infusion of spirit..etc...)<br />
<br />
2) When I get the next awesome item with million stamina, I get more profit from it.<br />
As long as Stamina stays at reasonable levels, I feel it is better to switch to raw hps if possible because sta is capped but hps are not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Sterix_VA</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">About ac vs hps...<br />
<br />
I was big believer of 1200-1250ish ac cap myself in pre-pop. I am bit over 1200 unbuffed hps and that is one limit I try not to lose.<br />
I will try hard to stay at 1200 unbuffed AC, but as long as I can keep that I would sacrifice some AC over hps.<br />
<br />
For example, in my situation...I would gladly swap clattering bone necklace for shaderock amulet.<br />
<br />
Our guild's level is that we have killed most of the stuff in Kunark, epiced lot of people, farming HoT, some luclin names like Va'Dyn, preparing to take out Vindi and other that level stuff...<br />
Never attempted any of the PoP boss mobs, bt Xanamech is pretty close goal as well.<br />
<br />
So I don;t think I have need nor possibilities for ac of 1400-1500...<br />
(my mitigation in luclin is good, I parsed 25% of Va'Dyn hits being minimum hits, while about 9% were maximum hits...rest of the hits were pretty evenly between min and max)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Hah! Awesome!<br />
<br />
Sterix is my guild leader and MT. The person I was having the conversation with!<br />
<br />
I still disagree with him though. I've always been a fan of armor class personally and I really agonize over swapping out for this, that or the other thing.<br />
<br />
So when I make gear decisions I usually try and find items with better AC, STA and HPs.<br />
<br />
That being said, I'd probably ditch my Dragon Tooth Choker for a Shaderock Amulet for the very reason that AC 8 isn't all that much better than AC 3, and I can boost AC easier in other slots.<br />
<br />
I'm not stupid (even if I sound like I am). I think Hit Points are extremely important.<br />
<br />
I also think there's something to be said about how a Yellowfang Earring is probably much more effective than a Black Sapphire Electrum Earring.</div></div><hr />

AC/HP question is kinda lame, how often does it come up? ppl mention the neck pieces, but really there arent that many pieces to agonize over as some put it. lack of ac or hp could make or break ya on some rounds depending on how the rng is behaving, if its really that tight though, probably need spare healer or serious upgrades.<br />

<br />
I've since been on a raid/spending spree, and although my STA is now down to 270, my HP are higher as I focussed on raw HP slightly more than the other stats.  I know I can make up that 10sta short fall (and more with AA) from shammy buffs, so it's hardly a problem.<br />
<br />
It's a question of balance.  Sure, raw HP are the most important stat for a tank at the higher end, and I pretty much hold that statement now throughout the game, but if I had my 5560hp unbuffed, but only had 600ac (I know, not likely), then I'd think there was something wrong.<br />
<br />
It's the quest of ever improvement - sure, my STR, AGI and DEX are stats that I don't want to suffer too much, but they're lower than my STA.<br />
<br />
This will be debated by tanks as long as there are tanks, my thoughts? HP/STA/AC/the rest, in that order, but if any one of those stats is ridiculously low, I'll do my best to work on that while not making the others suffer - hence balance.<br />

CH lands for 7500hp if it's cast by a level 39 cleric who's just bought the skill.  The clerics supporting 9k+ hp tanks, though, frequently have the Healing Adept and Advanced Healing Adept AA skills - and those AA skills do work in conjunction with Complete Healing.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Khumak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">My plan was to go all out AC until I hit 1250.  Then I started swapping in items that increased either sta or HPs as much as possible whether they decreased any other stats or not as long as I stayed above 1250.  Zero HPs was fine as long as the sta boost gave me the largest HP boost I could find.  <br />
<br />
Once I got to where I could max my STA with buffs I started swapping out sta items with raw HP items even if my unbuffed HP total went down as long as I could still max my sta with buffs.  This has had the slightly comical effect of giving me a lower unbuffed HP total than several of the tanks in my guild but a higher buffed total.<br />
<br />
Now that I'm closing in on 9k hps buffed I've been focusing more on AC and resists again as long as I don't have to sacrifice HPs.  7500 may be the cap on CH but having a 1k or larger buffer does make a difference in many cases.  Plus with crits I've been healed for over 8K on several occasions so it's not like it's wasted.  I've also been trying to get myself to 305 STA unbuffed to free up a buff slot but I'm not willing to sacrifice any AC, raw HPs, or resists to do it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think that's wrong.<br />
<br />
First of all, AGI adds marginal AC.  It may not be much, but it's something.<br />
<br />
Second, and more importantly, I think the key number is 120, not 100.  As I understand it, when your health goes below a certain percentage, your AGI drops by a third.  If your AGI falls below 80, your AC suffers dramatically.  So, with an AGI of 120, when you health is low and your AGI drops by a third, you're still at an AGI of 80, and you don't take a big AC hit.  That's how I understand it works, anyway.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Promethis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">My raid buff lineup is something like:<br />
<br />
1- Shield of Pain (Puresteel click)<br />
2- AoB / Avatar whichever is up<br />
3- Marzin<br />
4- Potn<br />
5- Focus<br />
6- Haste<br />
7- WoG<br />
8- CoTR<br />
9- CoTP<br />
10- Brells<br />
<br />
The rest are empty.  DI is in there somewhere depending on the mob and probabilities of me dying (like Reparm, or Xegony).</div></div><hr />
