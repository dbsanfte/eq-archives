<br />
I have recently decided to return to EQ along with some RL friends of mine.  Its been about a year since ive played and just about all my stuff is long gone (given away, etc).  I am still in the process of rebuilding myself and learning all the new stuff thats available.<br />
<br />
As you can see from my magelo, I am in pretty bad shape gear wise.  I would appreciate any advice on quick-upgrades that I can shoot for to get me back on my feet.<br />
<br />
Funds are somewhat limited so no Cloak of Flames type stuff for me :(   <br />
<br />
What new haste options are there?<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />

<br />
Soulscream belt - 31% haste<br />
Enchanted Sash of Wonder:- 31%<br />
Spiked Seahorse Belt:- 34%</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caldron</div><div class="date">02-26-2004, 11:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">How limited are you talking in funds?<br />
<br />
If you are really broke there are some good items from LDoN that are not that expensive in points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Doomflayer</div><div class="date">02-26-2004, 11:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Soulscream belt, about 29k pp, is about what you should shoot for. Hate to say this, but you will be farming pp for a good while, got a caster char to help?</div></div><hr />

I have restarted EQ along with some friends that have also been away for about the same time.  We consist of: Me, 61 Druid, 61 Paladin and 64 Enchanter.   Most of them still have all there stuff so I am the one needing the most help.<br />
<br />
I can probably get 12-15kpp but thats about it.<br />
<br />
Any recommended upgrades we can adventure for?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">paladiin</div><div class="date">02-26-2004, 01:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First of all, anything &gt; empty slots.  So get them filled with anything cheap to start.  Crustacean, Crafted, Validus Custodus, anything cheap and that's plate.  Don't go expecting to tank anything serious with this though - it's just a band-aid until you can get geared up.<br />
<br />
Soulscream Belt or Enchanted Sash of Wonder.  One of these two should be on your waist.<br />
<br />
http://www.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=21436<br />
http://www.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=22156<br />
<br />
However, skip the buying it part.  I camped the Soulscream at 53 with a mid 50's group.  It drops in Veksar.  I believe the drop rate is a bit better than the Enchanted Sash of Wonder from Droga (personal experience).  Should be able to get one in ~2 hours (depending on your luck, but that's what I've both seen and heard).  <br />
<br />
For your back, a very cheap option is a Crinose Cape of the Werewolf.  It should be under 1k for most servers now.  However, it drops fairly commonly from named in Mistmoore themed LDoN's (average group level 63).  You might be able to get lucky and just win one if you do some hunting with some 65's there.  <br />
http://www.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=23258<br />
<br />
For your feet, a free option would be Kingly Boots of Splendor which drop in Droga.  A group at your level could handle it no problem.  <br />
http://www.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=21771<br />
<br />
A cheap ear slot would be a Jagged Bone Hoop, likely under 1k in the local bazaar. Or if you're doing average level 63 LDoN's at Mistmoore for the above mentioned cape, you might come across a Lupine Frenzy Earring which would do nicely.<br />
http://www.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=23220<br />
http://www.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=21940<br />
<br />
For your neck, you could try to find an inexpensive Amulet of Mummy Wrappings in the bazaar, or again hunt for it in an average 63 LDoN, this time in Takish-Hiz.  A Ribbon Choker should be another inexpensive option in the bazaar.<br />
http://www.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=23829<br />
http://www.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=16451<br />
<br />
For your face, a Grobb Hide Mask is el cheapo option, should only be a few hundred pp in the bazaar, or can be camped with a group very easily at your level in Torgiran Mines (probably just easier to buy it though).  <br />
http://www.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=19256<br />
<br />
For range, I'd stick a cheap-o Goranga Idol there.  Better than nothin.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind there are fairly decent, and inexpensive or campable items.  There are of course better out there for you, but should give you some survivability in areas where you can get bigger upgrades (like Ornate drops in higher tier PoP).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wompem Ondahed</div><div class="date">02-26-2004, 04:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow man, its been a long time. We didn't know each other well but I kept up with your posts here on TSW.<br />
<br />
As above, Droga is the place to go. You can farm boots to wear and sale, also Copper Hammer of Striking and Sword of the Bloodsworn to use or sell. The camp is do-able by you'r core group and the drop-rate is nice. Easy money and free 1h setup. <br />
<br />
I hope you'r hunt goes well and don't forget LDoN if you guys have the expansion. The armor is slightly better than Ornate, and its free ( if you put in the time ).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kiya</div><div class="date">02-26-2004, 04:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow, been ages since I've seen ya on.  <br />
<br />
Another suggestion for gear hunting places would be veksar.  In addition to the soulscream belt, the Kylong Darkmail armor is a very nice suit.  <br />
<br />
I also second the vote to hunt in Lost Dungeons, if you have it.  The Everfrost and Takish suits are worth the time you put in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">02-26-2004, 05:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Huh, Blademan's Breastplate?  I take it that's the new name for the PoGrowth Warrior armorset?  I should pick up the Norrathian Times more often. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CasEci</div><div class="date">02-26-2004, 05:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Welcome Back!<br />
<br />
Hate to sound like a broken record, but LDoN will be your best bet. Droga, Veksar are both fantastic too.<br />
<br />
But your friends are perfect for Adv. groups. You can adventure with 4 but grab 2 more folks and get some decent exp along with points, killing two birds with one stone.<br />
<br />
And hell, crawling a dungeon, even an instanced one is FUN!<br />
<br />
Oh, BTW, get to PoK or EC and buy your new &quot;spells&quot; :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baadan</div><div class="date">02-26-2004, 06:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">WB Gaylon.. I remember your sig.<br />
<br />
Thats all I have to say though, paladiin pretty much said everything that needs to be.<br />
<br />
But as a cheaper alternative for earrings, you can go with trusty Black Sapphire ones (2ac 35hp)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Terail</div><div class="date">02-27-2004, 02:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">WB Gaylon.. wonder where you went off to lol. Pretty much LDoN and Droga what the other guys said, gluck to you myfriend.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ignore all the druids etc that say the PoM revamp ruined the zone, crawling and taking out various challenging named around the zone that drop loot every time is much better than camping Stomples for a year.<br />
<br />
Only named see invis, only named summon. Everything except halfling-type mobs are charmable. Everything, including named, are lullable. Repop time is 30 minutes, named aren't very rare (1 in 4ish). Expect a few wipes and there isn't a graveyard, but it's not hard to invis back in.<br />
<br />
May take a day or so to learn the zone; ports and false walls get confusing. Most of the pit traps were removed in the revamp, but the trap just south of gorilla professor is definitely still there. I'm not sure there's a way out if you fall in the pit, but there's quite a few mobs down there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gaylon</div><div class="date">02-27-2004, 09:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow thanks for all the welcomes and advice :)<br />
