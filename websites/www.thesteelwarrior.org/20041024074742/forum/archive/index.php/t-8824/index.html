<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shaimis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been working on getting my faction up to get into Kael to do this quest.  I seem to be having a problem doing the head turn in. He takes them but I don't recieve any faction for it, am i still to low on the faction table or do i have to turn four in at a time? Also How hard is it to get  the drops?  As you can see I need new gear and fast.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You'd prob get better armour faster by going LDoN unless you can jump in on some ToVN/ToVW raids and just club sh*t for faction.<br />
<br />
Kromzek/'rif faction sucks ass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>didiaquarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Pretty sure you have to do 4 at a time.  <br />
<br />
The heads suck for faction.  As Shik says, the best way to get 'Zek faction (the one you need for turn ins) is to kill dragons in West and North ToV.  This is also where you get the drops to turn in, so it works out.  <br />
<br />
Been a while, but I'm pretty sure the named in NToV don't give hits, just the trash.  Maybe Aary?  As well, the sleepers key dragons outside of ToV give hits as well.  Probably also Velketor.  <br />
<br />
Back when I did this, I stayed KoS to the Kromriff giants, but got to Ally with Kromzek from killing dragons.  But none of the Riff giants see invis, so thats ok.  You don't have to be non-kos to Tormax (a 3rd faction), but you have to be careful getting back to the turn in room behind his throne if he and/or his guards are up.  <br />
<br />
BTW, did you put in accurate skill values on your Defense and whatnot.  Looking at your gear, you seem to be doing ok for a 54 warrior.  (better than I was at the time, but then again, that was a while ago)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you want to do those quests, head to Skyshrine and kick some butt there. Again, the faction is purely + Zek, but it's some very decent hits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I can basically guarantee you won't be working on Warlord armor at 54.  Probably wanna look at some other alternatives, or hold off on that for awhile.</div></div><hr />
