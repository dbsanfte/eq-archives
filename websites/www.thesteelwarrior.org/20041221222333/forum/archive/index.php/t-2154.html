Velek/HS/Sebelis/Hole/Cazic<br />
may also try newly rewamped zones I hear xp there is nice, have not 2boxed there without other group mates.<br />
<br />
As for mana it takes, well its hard to say for me 2boxing in Tactics with AAs both druid and war have now and kei/virtue as the only non self buffs it takes me roughly 2 bubles of mana to take down upstairs mobs, probably same downstairs since they pretty much same. Thats unlsowed mobs in tactics btw, but if I went to veleks now thought I probably would be just fine with regen on me for single pulls hehe.<br />
<br />
Ohhh ya now I remember I was 2 boxing koblad vilage in velek pre pop when my druid dinged 58. Was pretty damn ez and xp was good. Also if no one camping spiders I like to pull trains and watch them die from DS :) I could do pull of 4-6 without trouble back then. That was fun. Also can do same thing in hole and sebelis too.</div></div><hr />
