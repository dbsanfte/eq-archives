<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Havyk Okenasmyl</div><div class="date">04-21-2004, 01:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">After spending a little bit of time in Droga a while back, I managed to come across all the parts for the Revenge for Vaxxim quest, which results in this bracer:<br />
<br />
Soft Leather Bracer of Gore<br />
AC: +5 Sta: +8 Agi: +8 Disease Resist: +10 Poison Resist: +10 HP: +70  <br />
Classes: Monk Rogue Warrior Berserker  <br />
Races: All Races <br />
Effect: Vengeance II<br />
 <br />
I haven't decided if I want to actually do the turn-in for it though because of the painfully low AC. I'm currently wearing a Bracer of the Myrmidon (AC: 22 STR: +2  DEX: +2  STA: +5  AGI: +9  HP: +15  SV FIRE: +3  SV COLD: +3  SV MAGIC: +3)<br />
<br />
Do you think it would be worth giving up the AC for the extra HP? My gear isn't all that great to begin with (my Magelo is in my sig below). Any advice would be appreciated. <br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
In my opinion --- go with the droga quest bracer for now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neksnappa</div><div class="date">04-21-2004, 08:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Basically it's 17 raw ac and 3fr/cr/mr versus 55 raw hp and 10dr/pr, and venge2 (for what it's worth). Most people use a 6:1 hp to ac ratio when comparing gear; meaning the Myrm bracer is better in that respect. The gore bracer has 11 more saves and 10 more atk though, as well as some stam. <br />
<br />
The deciding factor I think is... are the turn-in pieces for the gore bracer nodrop? If they are, turn them in, and keep them both on you... the myrm for when you tank, the gore for when you need saves and more hp (AEing mobs basically). If you can MQ the bracer of gore, for a decent amount of cash, I would do that, and spend the money on other slots where you'll get a bigger return for your cash.</div></div><hr />
