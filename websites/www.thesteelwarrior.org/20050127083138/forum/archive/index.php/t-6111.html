<br />
I see lots of these new wars who twinked their way up to about my level, and they all have superior hp to mine.  They are all ralloz zek worshiping with fierce heraldic that gives very nice hp's.<br />
<br />
I on the other hand worship brell.  I looked up the armor for me and its about half the hp..with wisdom instead of stamina etc. <br />
<br />
What should I do?  Is there anything buyable that I can use thats somewhat comparable to fierce heraldic?<br />
<br />
I waslooking at SS stuff...and even it is inferior.  Will I be weak compared to other warrior until I can get raid gear?<br />
<br />
Im frustrated here.  I want my diety changed =(<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?<br />
<br />
EDIT- Well not all SS is inferior, the bp legs and gloves I miay look into...Whats price for those MQ's on your servers so I can get a range (if possible of course)<br />
<br />
Thanks for your time to read my thread</div></div><hr />

And if im not mistaken dwarves can't warship Rallos Zek anyway.  I guess you can look thru Allakhazam to see if you can find some upgrades and dwarf deity specific crafted armor isn't all that bad.  Just gotta search for it.</div></div><hr />

Theres a few other assorted pieces worth getting from other sets too if you dont mind mixing and matching.<br />

I will check into SS mq's some are better some worse than fierce heraldic but it should somewhat even out, and will last me until I can get some ornate.<br />

Even though I had a PL that got me back in a relatively short time, I still regretted it even though my newly outfitted Barbarian had a full 500-600 more HP at the equivalent level. <br />
<br />
Even if you're a casual player, you can get the LDON armor/Ornate after you progress far enough. I'm starting to get in that stage, and I wonder where I could be if I had that extra 3 days /played time dungeoneering with my (almost entirely unique) Froglok instead of a_generic_barb_22443.<br />

<br />
Usually gloves, helmets and boots drop in abundance, so those should be the cheapest and especially the gloves are very nice.<br />
<br />
When BD cultural was new, there weren't many buyable alternatives, and therefor some races really got the shaft (iksar chain only low AC same a shaman armor *growl*). But with PoP, LDoN and GoD knows what droppable loot will come from there, you can buy something similar for most slots + SS MQs. <br />
It's not as easy as getting a full set of cultural, but possible to bazaar-equip to a similar level, none the less.</div></div><hr />

Not everyone in cultural armor is a twink, some of us have been around since before deity was anything other than a pain in the ass when travelling or a roleplaying thing.  Some of us just got lucky when they rolled out the new cultural stuffs.  :)</div></div><hr />

I paid 1500pp for velious glove MQ's, there probably a lil more now but i can't imagine they would be much more. I've found drops in ToV to be very sporadic though, in the one month or so my old guild spent there we never had one pair of plate gloves drop, and one night we had 6 pairs of plate greaves drops. Either way just ask around i'm sure you'll find someone cleaning out there bank willing to part with them for a reasonable price, i know i sure as hell have about 10 pieces of various SS armor rotting in my bank, might go to alts one day, but if I ever saw someone looking for em i'd sure as hell get rid of em pretty cheap.</div></div><hr />

You can get alot of nice gear at EF(760 points) and Nro camps (1492points).  I am not sure about the lower lvl as LDON did not come out until I 65.  LDoN IMO is better then ornate in alot of pieces.<br />
<br />
I would recommend the link following for doing searches.<br />
http://www.eqdiva.com/eq/items/LDoN.aspx<br />
<br />
The best thing with LDoN you can earn your own gear and then aug it to make it even better.<br />

I wish you the best of luck.  Just remember picking the wrong diety does not leave you without any choices, just makes it harder.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gront</div><div class="date">03-16-2004, 09:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Harlequin?  You're insane.<br />
<br />
No, no, wait, I'm sorry.  It's late and I'm tired, but that's no excuse for discourtesy.  Let me try that again.<br />
<br />
Harlequin?  Thanks for providing your Magelo; it acts as the perfect counterexample to your statement.<br />
<br />
Your neck armor.  AC 8, HP 30.  <br />
FH neck, 5k in the bazaar: AC 14, HP 50.<br />
<br />
Your face armor: AC 4, HP 0.<br />
FH face, 5k in the bazaar: AC 12, HP 60.<br />
<br />
Your shoulder armor: AC 19, HP 0.<br />
FH shoulders, 5k in the bazaar: AC 20, HP 60.<br />
<br />
Your back armor: AC 12, HP 50.<br />
FH cloak, 5k in the bazaar: AC 16, HP 80.<br />
<br />
Even your waist armor, with that nifty haste, is only AC 9, HP 30.<br />
FH waist, 5k in the bazaar: AC 19, HP 80.<br />
<br />
The difference?  6+8+1+4+10 = 29 raw AC, or about 44 cooked AC.  And 20+60+60+30+50 = 220 HP.  Just for the non-visible armor slots.<br />
<br />
Now you've got your wrists.  AC 12, HP 0.<br />
FH wrists: AC 25, HP 55.  For both wrists.<br />
<br />
And helm.  AC 26, HP 35.<br />
FH helm?  AC 25, HP 60.<br />
<br />
Arms?  AC 18, HP 10.<br />
FH arms?  AC 26, HP 60.<br />
<br />
Legs?  AC 35, HP 45.<br />
FH legs?  AC 40, HP 80.<br />
<br />
Gloves?  AC 20, HP 0.<br />
FH gloves?  AC 24, HP 50.<br />
<br />
Boots?  AC 25, HP 45.<br />
FH boots?  AC 30, HP 60.<br />
<br />
Breastplate, for gods' sake, you're wearing frikkin' Cobalt: AC 45, HP 50.<br />
But the FH BP?  AC 51.  HP 80.<br />
<br />
Shall we add that up?<br />
<br />
AC: 13+13-1+8+5+4+5+6 = 53 raw AC, or about 80 cooked.<br />
HP: 55+55+25+50+35+50+15+30 = 315 HP.<br />
<br />
Now, let's put that together.  Visible and invisible armor slots changed to FH.  <br />
<br />
You gain 124 cooked AC (82 raw) and 535 HP.  That's something like a 13% increase in AC and a 26% increase in HP.<br />
<br />
Don't you be telling me there are &quot;5 others in the ballpark&quot;.  If you'd worshipped Rallos Zek instead of Lord Agnos, you'd have 1108 AC and 2570 HP instead of 984 AC and 2035 HP.<br />
<br />
And the money you'd save would have enabled you to buy a second decent earring and some Valorium for your fingers.<br />
<br />
I'm going to do something I don't usually do, and post my Magelo here.  I am myself a follower of Lord Agnos, and not in a raiding guild; I'm a bazaar warrior like the rest of the losers.  But I've got a friend who's a high-level jeweler, and he helps out when he can.  And I've worked damn hard in LDoN and elsewhere to equip myself.<br />
<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=672331<br />
<br />
I'm wearing comfortably over 500k platinum in equipment.  Nearly 100 hours in LDoN.  And I could have gotten 80% to 90% as good in virtually every slot (i.e. everything but the helm) for under 50k total if I'd known to worship Rallos Zek.  Heck, I'd gain 2 AC and 35 HP right now in the arm slot alone, if I could wear FH armor.  4 AC in the shoulders.  25 HP in the face.  2 AC and 5 HP in the neck.  9 cooked AC and 65 HP *even with all the work and time and money I've put in*...if I'd just known to worship Rallos Zek.<br />
<br />
Don't tell *ME* there are &quot;5 others in the ball park&quot;.<br />

I know better.<br />

<br />
I was kicking myself, for many moons, mostly for seeing the FH bracers going for 4k, over any other piece of equipement.  It kinda sucked for awhile, but i got over it for the most part.  Ornate is nice, with more stats than FH (not counting bracers).  Various hard LDoN drops are very nice, as are the droppable elemental tradeskill gear.<br />
<br />
I say dont sweat it too much, FH is a hp crutch, replacing it, justifying taking off a 5k piece of gear, for some resists and stats, but a lost in hp, is hard. (again not counting those damn bracers)</div></div><hr />

<br />
 Except, of course, there are. Even RZ warriors like me know this. The only difficulty is getting up and getting them. Mine's a LOT closer to FH in all the slots I have then his, with the exception of the TWO pieces of FH I've ever owned. And in a few hundred more points, the boots go away as well. You'd have seen a better investment in AC and HP to go EF armor rather than Tak.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gront</div><div class="date">03-16-2004, 10:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As I've said before: the difference between the EF and Tak armors tends to be about 4 AC and 15 HP, and 730 points.<br />
<br />
If someone offered a 4 AC, 15 HP aug for 730 points, it would be considered quite competitive. <br />
<br />
If the offered a 4 AC, 15 HP aug *that didn't take an aug slot*, it wouldn't matter how many points it cost; people would be buying it and sticking it on every piece of armor it fit on.<br />
<br />
That's what the Tak armor is; it's the EF armor with a built in 4 AC, 15 HP aug that costs 730 AP and doesn't take up a slot.<br />
<br />

<br />
P.S. And yes, I have better gear than FH in all but three slots; significantly better, in some cases.  Which has less than nothing to do with the fact that the gear is not in any meaningful sense &quot;in the ballpark&quot; of FH, any more than Time drops are &quot;in the ballpark&quot; of stuff off Vindi and the Skyshrine quest armor.  The risk/reward for FH is completely ridiculous, and utterly skews the non-raiding warrior effort-benefit curve.</div></div><hr />

And, y'know, if Fierce Heralding were no drop, so you actually had to go to all that work to make it, I wouldn't consider its effort/reward at all out of whack.<br />

It's the fact that someone else can put in that effort once, and then churn out hundreds of pieces of armor at 5k each, that I object to.<br />

The people who were intelligent enough to look at the first pieces of Fierce that came out and see a business oppurtunity (Hrm, most warriors are barbarians or ogres..most barbs or ogres worship Zek...this could be a gold mine) could have made enough money to buy anything they wanted.  No one was restricted from rolling up a level 1 human like I did and getting them to 250 smithing.  Can't wear Fierce?  No problem, just sell it and buy things that are superior.  Boots of the storm, acid bracers, thulian mask, black plated collar.  <br />
<br />
Bottom line, if I wasn't RZ, I'd still be wearing gear comparable to Fierce because I made an assload of plat selling it to the people that needed it, and then I had a whole lot of fun equipping like 10 of my friend's toons in the best gear that was available at the time.  The whining is getting really old.  If you're sucking at this game because of your fucking diety, you're just not trying hard enough.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree and as I posted earlier my tank is agnostic but I do not think he suffers for it. Yes I could use the armor if i re-rolled him but ya all know what I like him the way he is. <br />
<br />
On the same subject my first toon was made long ago when I had no clue about the game and I made a Half-Elf Karana Ranger. (Yes yes a ranger I know.)  I still play him from time to time and now my tradeskill toon is about to GM fletching he is making Karana Arrows and my tank cannot use them but my ole ranger can. <br />
<br />
So in short LIVE WITH YOUR DECISIONS or CHANGE THEM. <br />
