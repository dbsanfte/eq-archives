<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brodda Thep</div><div class="date">10-21-2003, 12:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">After reading Furor's post on his DBotW and Vanazir parses I wondered how much agro the dual wielding option was really giving from its dps.  IT obviously out damaged the Vanazir but was that damage equating to more agro?  (I am of course ignoring  all procs.)<br />
<br />
I have a couple theories about how agro is determined using melee weapons.  ie how much hate is a weapons damage actually giving?<br />
<br />
Theory One:  (Proved correct.)<br />
Misses give as much hate as hits.<br />
<br />
Theory Two:  (Proved correct.)<br />
Offhand isn't nearly the agro as main hand.<br />
<br />
Theory Three: (This was proved incorrect.)<br />
Agro generated is only determined by the damage bonus of a weapon. <br />
<br />
To test this I used an SK and my monk.  I was using three different weapons.  A 8/20 1hb, a 13/50 two hander, and a 22/50 two hander.  The SK would tank with his back to the mob to avoid riposting.  For convenience I tested this on a Tarmok Beetle Herder in Fungus Grove.<br />
<br />
<br />
Proving Theory One:<br />
To prove theory one I had the SK pull a tarmok gatherer with two Terror of Terris, which increases hate by 510 according to Lucy.  Then I took the 13/50 and attacked until the mob turned onto me.  Then I repeated 5 times.  Attack is defined as a miss or a hit.<br />
<br />
Test One:<br />
11 attacks till it turned on me.<br />
9 hits<br />
2 misses<br />
842 damage<br />
<br />
Test Two:<br />
11 attacks till it turned on me.<br />
10 hits<br />
1 miss<br />
949 damage<br />
<br />
Test Three:<br />
11 attacks till it turned on me<br />
6 hits<br />
5 misses<br />
654 damage<br />
<br />
Test Four:<br />
11 attacks till it turned on me<br />
6 hits<br />
5 misses<br />
613 damage<br />
<br />
Test Five:<br />
11 attacks till it turned on me<br />
7 hits<br />
4 misses<br />
633 damage<br />
<br />
I wanted these tests to be very short so that I could get large variances in hit %.  As you can see the mob always turned on me at 11 attacks.  <br />
<br />
So from this I would say that a miss is  the same agro that a hit is regardless of damage done.<br />
<br />
<br />
Proving Theory Two:<br />
To prove this theory I had the SK pull with two Terror of Terris.  I had a bio orb for whichever hand I didn't want to attack with and a 8/20 <br />
<br />
1hb in the other.<br />
<br />
Primary Agro:<br />
Test One:<br />
28 attacks till it turned on me<br />
19 hits<br />
9 misses<br />
780 damage<br />
<br />
Test Two:<br />
30 attacks till it turned on me (I triple attacked last round)<br />
18 hits<br />
12 misses<br />
861 damage<br />
<br />
Secondary Agro:<br />
Test One:<br />
70 attacks till it turned on me<br />
50 hits<br />
20 misses<br />
1465 damage<br />
<br />
Test Two:<br />
70 attacks till it turned on me<br />
52 hits<br />
18 misses<br />
1468 damage<br />
<br />
As you can see it took far more damage and attacks to get the mob turned on me when I was using the baton in the offhand.  I had to make 2.5 more attacks from the offhand and do nearly twice the dps to generate the same agro that the primary hand generated.  This is the primary reason why dual wielding sucks for agro.  I had originally planned to do this test having the SK cast FIVE terror of terris and then engaging.  But when I switched to secondary the mob would not have turned onto me before dieing.  So I had to shorten it greatly.<br />
<br />
<br />
Not Proving Theory Three<br />
<br />
To try and prove this theory I used two different two handers with the same delay.  If I was right then the mob should have turned after the same number of attacks even though one had a greater damage rating.  So I had the SK pull with Terror of Terris and then cast four more times.<br />
<br />

<br />
As you can see it took 34 attacks for a 13/50 weapon and 30 attacks for a 22/50 weapon for the mob to turn onto me.  <br />
<br />
Just for the hell of it I took out my 54/30 weapon to see how long it would take to get agro.  Unfortunately it procced a 3 second 200 dd stun before I got agro.  HOWEVER, I did 3155 damage in melee before the proc and it didn't turn onto me.  Once I procced I turned off attack.  The mob CONTINUED to beat on the SK.  After two rounds of melee onto the SK I turned attack back on and had agro on the very next hit.  <br />
<br />
What Does All This Mean?<br />
<br />
Well we can now say that each swing of the weapon adds a set amount of hate.  All of my parses support this.  To make this information useful we need to figure out how to determine how much hate a weapon adds per swing.  I believe it is based on the damage bonus of a weapon and the damage rating of the weapon.<br />
<br />
We can start by looking at Terror of Terris. This is said to add 510.  But we can just think of this as one ToT of agro.  The number doesn't really matter, but for the people that have trouble thinking with pure variables I will stick with 510 agro.  So if you look at the first test you see that each swing adds:  2 x 510 / 11 = 93-102 agro. (I don't want to explain why there is a range there.  But it needs to be there. After all it could have only needed 10.0000001 swings to get agro)  To  verify this we can take the third tests.  5 x 510 / 34 = 75 - 77 agro.  They don't match up, so these ranges are wrong.  Well, this is expected.  Many mobs have their initial hate capped.  To prove this have a shaman go slow a skeleton in karnors basement without first agroing it and run.  It will stop and attack the first person it comes to.  Next, have the same shaman walk up to the mob and let it start hitting the shaman.  Now slow it. The mob will be stuck to the shaman for quite some time.  <br />
<br />
So now the equation is Mod_ToT + ToT = 11*X*ToT and Mod_ToT + 4*ToT = 34*X*ToT.  If we sub in 510 for ToT (This is just to simplify things.) <br />
<br />
Mod_ToT + 510 = 5610 * X  and Mod_ToT + 2040 = 17340 * X  Solving for Mod_ToT and substituting we can find that X = 0.13.  So each swing equals approximately 0.13 ToTs or 66 hate.  All the previous was to find out how much hate was actually generated by pulling with ToT and the subsequent ToTs. BTW MoD_ToT (the ToT used to pull this particular mob) gave 216 hate. (This is NOT exact btw I didn't deal with that pesky range, but it is good enough to get started with.)  But now we have to go back and put inthe possible ranges.  I am going to skip a lot of proof work here and just lay it down for the three weapons I used.  The actual hate value for each weapon is somewhere between those ranges.<br />
<br />
Weapon  Hate Range<br />
13/50   66-73<br />
22/50   75-78<br />
8/20    25-27<br />
8/20Off 10-11<br />
<br />
What I hope to do is find some sort of formula using damage, delay, and/or damage bonus that can be used to determine how much hate each swing of a weapon gives.<br />
<br />
Damage Bonus + Damage is pretty close.  I took out a 40 damage 36 delay weapon which has a damage bonus of 39.  Which according to this formula would give 39 + 40 = 79 hate.  Which means it would take 29 swings to take agro off of an SK that pulled a Tarmok Battle Herder with ToT and then cast ToT four times.  I tested it and it took 30 swings.  BUT the last attack round was a double attack so that formula works for that weapon.  But that falls apart when you start looking at one handers.<br />
<br />
Perhaps they use a modified formula for one handers.  Say 1.25 * damage + damage bonus.<br />
<br />
To test this I used a Stone Etched Mallet 28/28 making sure that it didnt proc.  And the SK ToT pulled and then ToTed once more.  <br />
<br />
Test in Offhand:<br />
22-23 swings to get agro for a agro per swing of 33.<br />
<br />
Test in Primary<br />
15-16 swings to get agro for a agro per swing of 45.<br />
<br />
Both of those data points fit, BUT my first data point with the 8/20 does not fit.<br />
<br />
Summary:<br />
<br />
Each swing of a weapon gives a set amount of hate regardless of whether or not you hit the mob.  A critical hit for 700 damage is no more hate than a hit for 40 damage.  It seems that the amount of hate is determined similar to the values used to determine DPS for a given weapon combo.  (damage * modifier + damage bonus)  Except in this case the modifier is VERY low.  IN damamge calculations you will have a modifier of 3-4 anymore, but in hate calculations it seems to be around 1.  So damage bonus is a significant contributor to hate.  Thus why off hand weapon generates much less agro than primary hand weapons.  (Of course being swung less often is also a factor.)  As you get better weapons your offhand will perform better hate wise in comparison to your main weapon.  THis is why a less damaging two handed weapon can out taunt a more damaging one handed combo.<br />
<br />
This is far from complete though.  Different mobs need to be checked, Different weapon combos need to be checked.  Lots of stuff.  If anyone is up to the task I would welcome input.  There are a couple of things that make this hard to test.  If I was to do it over again I would have found a KOS mob to test on so I could agro through proximity instead of using a spell.  Also you need to set up a baseline to make sure that the spell you are using to get agro is adding hate in a linear fashion.  This means setting up a baseline and checking to see that it takes twice as many swings to get agro from a caster of some sort if they cast their hate spell twice as much.  Or you could do what I did, which is a pain and prone to error.  As I said earlier I wouldn't repeat the test in the manner I did it in.</div></div><hr />

Try repeating the test with two players, both wielding the same weapon, but both with the different weapon skills.  My intuition wants me to believe the one with the higher skill will end up with aggro after the same number of swings (assuming the more skilled combatant will land more of them.)  Maybe test it that way?<br />
It has also been shown that Terror spells give wacky amounts of aggro at range.  some claim that they dont work at range at all.  another thing to consider.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">10-21-2003, 01:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm pretty sure aggro generated per swing is just based on the potential damage on your weapon, which is obviously a function of its damage and damage bonus.  It is entirely possibly that there are separate formulas used for 1H versus 2H weapons though.  The actual damage you deal out is pretty much irrelevant.  For example you can attack a mob while it's enraged to keep aggro, whereas if it's off you'd lose aggro, but you're doing 0 damage to the mob even when you continue to swing.  You can be heavily attack debuffed or simply against high AC mobs (Luclin comes to mind) but it isn't any harder to get aggro, and likewise having Aura of Hate/Avatar/Ferocity doesn't appear to get you more aggro.  Hitting a mob for 652 with a critical hit with Vanazir sure doesn't appear to get their attention any more than other hits.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Haven't had a chance to read through the post yet, but looking forward to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kassel</div><div class="date">10-21-2003, 01:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Crits not affecting the hate generated would fall in line with the castery end of things. Pretty sure I remember seeing a set of tests on graffe's that indicated as much, so crits are aggro-free damage. Great for casters, suck for warriors.<br />
<br />
The miss finding is interesting, which again suggests that melee aggro isn't all that different from caster aggro -- I believe the same tests showed that full resists generated just as much aggro as a full hit.<br />
<br />
It might be interesting (if a bit difficult) to test whether or not the extra attacks from double attack/flurry factor in on aggro. <br />
<br />
Your skeleton example from karnors doesn't quite hold, as it aggroing on whatever it runs into isn't a cap on initial aggro, it's the usual undead hate.<br />
<br />
The Mod_ToT is most likely range aggro digging in a bit.<br />
<br />
One thing that's certain from the graffe tests is that aggro does not decay. It may have a cap point, but you aren't likely to hit it -- if they're using 32 bit values for hate, you could dump out 20k hate a second for 59 1/2 hours before you hit the limit. I recall some anecdotal evidence that there might be a bug with Boggle, letting it wrap around the negative, but it certainly doesn't happen with Concussion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brodda Thep</div><div class="date">10-21-2003, 02:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My theory on hate per swing is that the hate generated by each swing is effectively the potential damage of that swing which would support both the results of Brodda's test aswell as having a different result if the same weapon was wielded by someone with a different skill level or different amount of atk.<br />
<br />
<br />
Not quite.  In hate values I found that the hate generated depends HEAVILY on the damage bonus.  Or rather the damage component of a weapon is often close to or much smaller (as in the case of 12/50 weapons) than the damage bonus.  <br />
<br />
Max damamge is about 5.x * damage+ damage bonus of a weapon.  While I am theorizing the hate generated by each swing is approximately 1 * damage + damage bonus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brodda Thep</div><div class="date">10-21-2003, 02:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Your skeleton example from karnors doesn't quite hold, as it aggroing on whatever it runs into isn't a cap on initial aggro, it's the usual undead hate.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
That doesn't hold about the proximity agro.  If it was then simply getting agro first through proximity and THEN slowing wouldn't make the skelly stick to the shaman like glue.  While slowing before initially getting on the hate list is almost NO agro.  This I think is what people see a lot when they talk about proximtiy agro.  Well that and certain mobs giving people large amounts of negative hate bonus for being out of range.  <br />
<br />
Though, saying that it might be because range actually reducing the hate given for an action is interesting.  I always assumed it was static.  For instance, start a rotation on a tank while doing AoW, after the first CH lands walk up to AoW.  He will smash you into the ground.  But if you stay OOR of his melee he won't summon you.<br />
<br />
Still, I would like to know if range actually does affect hate like that.  I was under the impression it worked a different way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ladas Sindarin</div><div class="date">10-21-2003, 11:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Very interesting Brodda... but one thing I see that I wonder if you can rule out with more testing...<br />
<br />
510 Hate isn't very much, and in your short tests, even though the damage varies soime (1h mainhand), the damage differences aren't more than a lucky hit or two from a monk your level.  How does the hit-miss distribution for those attacks work per round... ie, the tests where it took 900 damage to turn the mob, where you last four of the 11 swings hits that did 300 damage?<br />
<br />
I suspect you are right regarding hits and misses having the same aggro, but given how short your fights are (and I can't see the data), its something to rule out.<br />
<br />
Also, Raaj and I did some testing similiar to this in PoV on one of the two guards in the building in Zone in.  (We were looking at how much druid healing would be required to pull aggro from a warrior using melee vs a ranger using FL/Ensnare, then the success rate of warrior Taunt on a 60th level mob).  But, with a Shaman to slow and heal the SK, you could easily get a bigger sample with higher hate values to overcome.  That should help you narrow down the modifiers for 1H and 2H.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solinar</div><div class="date">10-21-2003, 11:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I totally agree that weapon damage hate is most likely based on some % of potential damage done and not actual damage.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, this is expected. Many mobs have their initial hate capped. To prove this have a shaman go slow a skeleton in karnors basement without first agroing it and run. It will stop and attack the first person it comes to. Next, have the same shaman walk up to the mob and let it start hitting the shaman. Now slow it. The mob will be stuck to the shaman for quite some time.<br />
<br />
I believe you are mis-interpreting an observed phenomenon.  Mobs aggro changes dependent on some characteristic or flag.  The dumber they are, the more likely they are to ignore hate totals and just attack the closest person.  Its commonly referred to as &quot;undead aggro&quot;.  Undead are stupid and, like your karnors experience, will often just attack the closest person unless a HUGE hate disparity is built up.  I dont know that its a matter of hate capping (although that certainly is possible) but your experience was a case of undead aggro methinks, not hate capping.</div></div><hr />

Anyone remember wurmslayer?? :P.  Just that the paradigm might be different than what we suspected.  This would also lend quite a bit of credence to the difficulty monks have at avoiding aggro.  They swing a LOT and typically have faster weapons than warriors.  Any rangers out there have that 5/14 whip to try and use to test?? :P<br />

That doesn't explain the drastic change in behavior.<br />
<br />
Look.  I exped down in karnors for ages.  If my shaman cast slow before getting agroed it would then run to him and my monk would take one swing and it would attack the monk.  ANd the shaman was closest to the mob still.  However, if the mob agroed my shaman before the slow landed then I would have to sit there and swing at the mob for quite some time before it would turn.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dugman</div><div class="date">10-21-2003, 03:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Great thread!  I really hope that you can follow this up with more tests to get a solid estimate on aggro per swing based on damage rating and damage bonus.  One useful formula you could derive next would be aggro per second:<br />
<br />
Aggro per second = <br />
(Aggro per swing / swings per second)  +  (Aggro per proc / seconds per proc)<br />
<br />
<br />
Note that seconds per proc is roughly 30 for most main hand weapons.  I'm not sure of the off-hand proc rates off the top of my head, but they too are fairly constant.  Odds are the maximum normal damage/5 is a damage procs aggro, plus any stun aggro.<br />
<br />
Hypothetically, using the damage bonus + damage estimate for two handers and 1.25*damage + damage bonus for one-handers, for instance, at 65th level all one handed weapons would do about 1.25*damage + 13 aggro per swing.  So, estimating +10 delay = +one second between  swings, aggro per second would be roughly (1.25*dam +13) * 10 / Delay.   For a two-hander, it would be (dam + dam bonus) * 10 / Delay.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'll be very interested to see some follow-up numbers to see how this all pans out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brodda Thep</div><div class="date">10-21-2003, 03:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">weighted ax is great for this. potential damage is greater then 510. pull with one tot or 2 should get agro in 2 swings or 4. depending on tots used. could do it till you mis twice in a row if you still get agro then miss generate agro.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah, I bet 5 swings for pulling with a tot and one more ToT.  Because the hate generated would be damage bonus + damage or 132 + 45 = 177 per attack.  725/177 = 4.1 which you have to round up to 5.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kaledan</div><div class="date">10-21-2003, 03:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nice work.<br />
<br />
Playing with the numbers a bit, the formula DB + 11 * MINIMUM seems to be a reasonable fit for all types of weapons. Sounds like the kind of thing someone might have hacked in as a guess of average weapon damage (11 is close to the average of a 1 to 20 roll).<br />
<br />

There are some iffy things about theory #1 &quot;Misses give as much hate as hits&quot;.  Try repeating the test with two players, both wielding the same weapon, but both with the different weapon skills.  My intuition wants me to believe the one with the higher skill will end up with aggro after the same number of swings (assuming the more skilled combatant will land more of them.)  Maybe test it that way? <br />
<br />
You could also use some combination of (ferine) avatar or other raw atk buffs, str buffs, whatever to have the same person have a different chance to hit.<br />

Terrors give LESS aggro than listed if they are the only aggro events, but since Brodda kept the numbers of terrors constant across tests he's comparing, it doesn't matter what the absolute hate is, except for calculating the numbers.<br />

The formula given was a reasonable approximation of the damage per swing pre-Kunark, but since, with the improvement in damage tables, skill caps, raw attack, str etc... it *drastically* underestimates damage.  Accordingly our melee agro per melee damage ratio has fallen dramatically.  As a lvl 65 warrior w/GSo4W and no worn attack I'd estimate my average damage being min*30+DB rather than min*11+DB.  Using the min*30 formula would literally double my melee agro generation.<br />
<br />
Being more realistic, if the formula holds, then as a rule of thumb melee agro per melee damage (which we might as well call APD, and as warriors want to maximise) is highest for 28+ delay 2handers, followed by dual wielding followed by delay 27- 2handers.  VERY slow and VERY fast 1 handers violate this, as might VERY slow 2handers.  The DBotW, for example, would absolutely SUCK at melee agro generation for a weapon of it caliber at 57 agro/35 delay on Kaledan's scale or well under a 2 to 1 ratio, worse than,  say, 35/20 for a BoC.  A GSo4W would do much better at 80/31, and while that discounts an offhand, even an EoE would only have a 22/20 offhanded, and assuming your offhand fired as often as your main (hah) DBotW+EoE would have all but the same melee agro generation as a GSo4W.</div></div><hr />

If they were ignored, then some portion of the damage potential is agro free which could be useful to know for non-tanking classes like rogues.<br />

There is some anecdotal information that says they are possibly ignored, since every Main tank I have ever heard of for Ssra Emperor has ignored bane weapons and just used their normal hate procs.<br />

running these tests on mobs could help us evaluate the relative &quot;stickiness&quot; of mob targeting. That is, some mobs might switch targets more easily than other mobs, by adjusting the value they give to the &quot;current target&quot; part of the bonus side of their aggro algorithm.<br />

I think undead just have a low &quot;stickiness&quot; value, hence their sensitivity to proximity aggro.</div></div><hr />

I will have to second that observation.  When I first received my GSo4W, my 2hb skill was extremely low.  I'm talking like 30's.

Procs are one big random factor.  Another is the taunt skill check, which may or may not work on a given attempt.  Both of these factors alone can cause ping pong within melee groups.  Likewise, people who use feign or evade to reduce aggro don't always succeed.<br />

I'm sorry, I should have clarified.  For example, as our guild has a lot of warriors and paladins, we'll often have grinding groups of 4 tanks, cleric, and chanter/shammy.  The mobs will ping-pong between the melees.. only 1 of whom is taunting or using proc weapons (the MT).  I'm sorry, I figured ppl would realize that I was talking about situations where procs or taunts would not explain it.  In this same situation, feign death/evade is not an issue.  I'll agree somewhat on the proximity agro factor, but only to a very minor extent.  We're usually pretty good about melee range, with the tank being right on top of the mob.</div></div><hr />

Well, I do believe 100% that each attack that is made is a set hate value.  However, the random element is of course taunt checks, procs, etc.  Which you addressed.  The one thing you didn't think of was the double/triple/flurry/riposte rates.  You never make a set number of attacks.  Sometimes you double, sometimes you triple, sometimes the tank ripostes, etc, etc.  All of which will affect agro.<br />
<br />
At any rate, I am away from EQ at the moment, but I hope to do some more parses by the end of the week.</div></div><hr />

If this is true it would explain while we've always percieved that faster main hand weapons generate more agro, even when those weapons aren't doing more damage (ie the ratio is worse but the still hold agro better).  The damage of the main hand weapon is less important than the delay....except where the minimum jumps up to 2 - ie 15 damage weapons in secondary OR primary should be a jump up from lesser-damage weapons.<br />

If you use the above forumla suggested by Kaledan you could find a Hate Value based on Hate per swing divided by delay.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yakk</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 02:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, lets run the math.<br />
<br />
BoC mainhand: 13 + 22 Hate Per Attack (HPA) = 35 HPA.<br />
BoC offhand: 22 HPA.<br />
BoC proc hate per second: 700 / 30 = 23.33 HPS<br />
<br />
BoC mainhand hasted HPS: 1.8 (DA) * 2 * 35 / 2 + 23.33 = 86.3333 HPS<br />
<br />
BoC offhand hasted HPS: 1.8 * 2 * 22 / 2 * 0.8 + 23.33 = 55 HPS. (probably have proc rate wrong for an offhand)<br />
<br />
Primal (or other 20 delay, &lt; 15 damage weapon) offhand hasted  HPS: 1.8 * 2 * 11 / 2 * .8 = 15.84 HPS<br />
<br />
BoC primary/Primal offhand HPS: 102.17 HPS.<br />
<br />
GSoT HPS (no AA): 1.8 * (33 + 36) * 2 / 3 = 82.8 HPS + stun proc.<br />
<br />
Placing a stun proc at 700 hate, that's 106.133 HPS.  GSoT aggro should be roughly the same as BoC+Primal.  It needs 575 hate per second to match the hate of a BoC + Primal.<br />
<br />
If the 2 H AA abilities boost 2H swing rate by any significant degree, the GSoT will own a BoC+Primal (or the like) combo.<br />
<br />
There are a few edges to 2 1 H weapons.  First, if you can get both of their damage at 15 or above (according to the round rules outlined), you are in a good place.  Second, if they both have aggro procs, and both are augmented with LDoN +aggro procs (either stun or anger), you can get (probably) better aggro than with a single proc and single LDoN +aggro proc.<br />
<br />
Very interesting model, however.</div></div><hr />

Is there really a large hate step going from 14 to 15 damage?<br />
<br />
Blade of Tactics has 14 damage (the non-proc warrior epic sword)<br />
Centi Warhammer has 15 damage (a cheap bazaar vendorable weapon).<br />
<br />
If the &quot;round * 11&quot; math is correct, the Centi Warhammer in the offhand should take half as many swings to steal aggro compared to the Blade of Tactics.<br />
<br />
A pretty simple test, and the results should either confirm or deny the rounding * 11 theory.</div></div><hr />

He mentions that some tests went an attack or two over the normal number because the last attack was a double or triple attack.  What are the odds that those were the ONLY double and triple attacks he had in any of the trials?  I would assume that he had them sprinkled throughout, and he counted them like any other attack.  The results he posted would not have been as consistent as they were if double and triple attacks only generated one attack's worth of aggro.<br />

When you use the sk to add +hate however, have the sk get in melee range of the mob first then cast terror spells as they give only 1 hate when the caster is standing outside of the mob's hitbox.  Also, I dont suppose youll be willing to try this for other classes?  I would be willing to bet monks/rogues/beastlords and possibly rangers/bards all recieve less hate while using the same weapon, also Warriors generate more than Knights with the same weapon some of this obviously is due to an increased number of swings but it might be worth looking into to see if you have an innate aggro modifier which I would be willing to bet you do as 1 enraging blow proc gives you more hate than me casting a terror of thule/terris combo (1110 hate), yet a 2 thule combo still keeps me ahead (1200 hate), however since eb is only listed as 700, it seems like theres a modifier there somewhere...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yakk</div><div class="date">10-31-2003, 02:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Trying to work out the relative hate effects of damage bonus and weapon damage.<br />
<br />
I am avoiding ascribing any fixed amount of hate to ToT casts, as people have mentioned the hate generated isn't always linear in the number of casts.<br />
<br />
We have a test where the weapon delay, hence the damage bonus, is constant, while the weapon damage varies.  This is the 12/50 and 22/50 test.<br />
<br />
So, I can do some algebra on this.<br />
<br />
SmallHate = hate from 12/50 weapon per swing.<br />
LargeHate = hate from 22/50 weapon per swing.<br />
SKHate = amount of hate the SK built up that the weapon had to beat.<br />
<br />
From the 12/50 weapon tests we have:<br />
34 SmallHate &gt;= SKHate &gt;= 33 SmallHate<br />
From the 22/50 weapon tests we have:<br />
30 LargeHate &gt;= SKHate &gt;= 29 LargeHate<br />
<br />
Now, we know LargeHate is more hate than SmallHate.  Call the difference in hate Y, and renamed the small hate to X.<br />
<br />
Then,<br />
SmallHate = X<br />
LargeHate = X + Y<br />
<br />
Rewording<br />
34 X &gt;= SKHate &gt;= 33 X<br />
30 X + 30 Y &gt;= SKHate &gt;= 29 X + 29 Y<br />
<br />
Rearranging, and making the inequalities strict:<br />
34 X &gt; 29 X + 29 Y<br />
30 X + 30 Y &gt; 33 X<br />
Or<br />
5 X &gt; 29 Y<br />
30 Y &gt; 3 X<br />
<br />
Y is the hate caused by the 10 extra damage, and X is the hate caused by the 12/50 weapon per swing.<br />
<br />
Ok, now lets try out the two theories.<br />
<br />
The first one is that every point of damage adds a certain amount of hate, and every point of damage bonus.<br />
<br />
Call the amount of hate per damage D, and the amount of hate per damage bonus B.<br />
<br />
Then X = 51 B + 12 D and Y = 10 D.<br />
<br />
Using:<br />
5 X &gt; 29 Y<br />
30 Y &gt; 3 X<br />
<br />
255 B + 60 D &gt; 290 D<br />
300 D &gt; 153 B + 36 D<br />
<br />
255 B &gt; 230 D<br />
153 B &lt; 264 D<br />
<br />
0.9 D &lt; B &lt; 1.73 D<br />
<br />
So, the hate from a point of damage bonus would be anywhere from 90% to 173% of the hate from the &quot;weapon damage&quot; field.<br />
<br />
The other theory is that aggro is steppy.  There is the hate from the damage bonus, and a constant amount of hate that goes up as you break certain thresholds.<br />
<br />

Very interesting and seems to explain some of the things I've noticed.<br />
<br />
Certainly Rogues with the 15+/dly weapons are WAY drawing more agro than 14-/dly.<br />
Where dly fairly similar.<br />
<br />
I've often seen Paladins claim they get too much agro from Slay Undead but I've been pretty adamant that the bonus damage from slay is agro free. Plenty of times I've had seriously lucky runs of slays and never once drawn agro.<br />
<br />
Ghouls require a magic weapon to hit them.<br />
They may prove usefull for longer tests.<br />
<br />
Assuming DoTs generate the same APS as DPS I will get my wife help me run some tests. Assuming I can find a good variety of non magic weapons.</div></div><hr />

I was planning on making this info aviable to the general public in a couple more days after I had more work done on it (I wanted all formulas for SK's solved first), but my testing partners have been busy so in the intrest of moving this testing along I'm posting it early.  I believe your formula is incorrect, and that damage does not have a modifier on it.  Instead I believe it is the damage bonus which contains the modifier.  Taking your 12/50 weapon and 22/50 weapon for example try using this formula instead.  Damage+Damage Bonus*Modifier for a monk using a 2h weapon assuming this formula is correct your moifier would be between 1.05 and 1.11.  For 1h given the limited testing of it the valid range is quite large but I believe your modifier on it to be between 1.27 and 1.49 however, since I'm an SK (and being primarily concerned with solving my classes aggro formulas first) I do not have an offhand weapon to test with so I cannot offer a valid formula for that which would work as I have not been able to test it.  I do believe 1h/2h bash and slam aggro will be the same formula as an offhand weapon though and given your testing of it I would bet that the formula of it is simply Damage*Modifier, which does work within the range I stated for you earlier for 1h weapons, and would actually assist in narrowing the range down.<br />

Sure, if your purpose in using it was to get attention, its working fine then.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brael</div><div class="date">11-07-2003, 07:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One other possibility for the formula is that its using division instead of multiplication.  The reason I think this is awhile ago aggro modifying spells were changed (maybe some of you Warriors remember on Lucy when Echo of Anger got changed from increase by 15% to decrease by .85%).<br />
<br />
This makes me think that instead of the formula being dmg+(dmg bonus*mod) its actually dmg+(dmg bonus/mod).  This would mean that the modifier on 2h weapons would actually be in the range of .88 to .93 for a Monk (or atleast I think you're a monk Brodda, correct me if im wrong).<br />
<br />
Also, in the thead I linked above I have far more proof posted that supports this formula  (so far it's worked successfully for 12 different weapons, but not all have been posted in it, only 9 listed there.  Once I'm certain on offhand and bash/slam aggro I will be testing on mobs of various level ranges).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brodda Thep</div><div class="date">11-10-2003, 03:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I ran some more tests.  I doubt I will run more as these are a pain in the ass to do.  I used a paladin this time against a centi dator in ME.<br />
<br />
First, I wanted to set a baseline and make sure each stun was adding hate linearly.<br />
Tests using 8/20 in offhand to get agro<br />
<br />
Initial Agro <br />
1	7<br />
2	6<br />
3	6<br />
<br />
Initial Agro + one force of Akera (4sec/61)<br />
1	69<br />
2	68<br />
3	68<br />
<br />
Initial Agro + two force of Akera<br />
1	132<br />
2	132<br />
3	132<br />
4	132<br />
<br />
Initial Agro + three force of Akera<br />
1	194<br />
2	193<br />
<br />
I did do the tests more than I had planned to because the results were coming out way different than I thought.  I was getting agro at what I thought was greatly varying swings.  Turned out I was just looking at hits and when I added the misses almost all the numbers came out the same.  So again I will say a miss = hit for agro.  Also the dators seem to have a pretty large bonus hate for agroing first.  Also from these tests I would say that each stun added the same amount of agro.<br />
<br />
Next, I wanted to see if stuns generate different amounts of agro.<br />
<br />
Initial Agro + force of Akilae  (4sec/65)<br />
1	68<br />
<br />
Initial Agro + Quellious Word of Serenity  (10sec/65 + 108dd)<br />
1	85<br />
<br />
Initial Agro + Desist  (2.5/55)<br />
1	68<br />
So from those tests a stun is a stun is a stun.  And DD adds decent agro. <br />
<br />
Playing with the numbers a bit, the formula DB + 11 * MINIMUM seems to be a reasonable fit for all types of weapons. Sounds like the kind of thing someone might have hacked in as a guess of average weapon damage (11 is close to the average of a 1 to 20 roll).<br />
<br />
MINIMUM is the minimum possible damage for the weapon ignoring damage bonuses, i.e. RND(DAM/10), so 2 for a 15 dam weapon. <br />
I wanted to test this, but I couldn't find a 14 damage weapon.  However if the formula was correct then a 9/36 would be the same agro as a 8/20 so I used a 9/36.<br />
<br />
Changed to 9/36 in offhand<br />
Initial Agro + force of Akera<br />
1	62<br />
2	63<br />
3	62<br />
<br />
Next tests use Initial Agro + two force of Akera<br />
Changed to 9/36 in primary<br />
1	49<br />
2	49<br />
<br />
Changed to 8/20 in primary<br />
1	54<br />
2	55<br />
<br />
Changed to a 8/28 in primary<br />
1	54<br />
2	54<br />
<br />
Changed to 15/32 in primary<br />
1	39<br />
<br />
Changed to 15/32 in secondary<br />
1	71<br />
2	71<br />
<br />
I think it is safe to say that DB + 11 * MINIMUM does not work as the damage rating of the weapon does come into play.  I through in the 8/28 to show that agro is determined by damage and damage bonus alone.  We can see that a 9/36 has approximately 10% more agro than a 8/20.  And if the agro was determined by Damage + damage bonus then the agro would be 22 for the 9/36 and 21 for the 8/20 and 28 for the 15/32. So we would have 39 * 28 = 1092 and 54 * 21 = 1134 and 49 * 22 = 1078 which are pretty close.  The 54 * 21 seems to be the farthest off, but it only really needs to be withing two swings (one from double attack and one from being on the 'edge', and it is damn close.  But that still seems fairly loose.  Also, when you are looking at this the values don't actually matter.  This is all relative.<br />
<br />
With the 1.25 * damage + damage_bonus we get<br />
23 * 54 = 1242<br />
24.25 * 49 = 1188<br />
18.75 * 39 = 1238<br />
And in secondary for the 15/32<br />
18.75 * 71 = 1331<br />
<br />
So to get some comparison I did a two hander test.<br />
Changed to 13/50<br />
1	19<br />
2	20<br />
<br />
With the initial test seeming to support agro as damage + damage_bonus we have 13 + 51 = 64.  Or agro of 1260. Which seems to be far closer to the 1.25 * damage + damage_bonus for the one handers. Unfortunately the offhand 15/32 kinda screws that one up.<br />
<br />
<br />
I wanted to see how + cold or magic or whatever type of damage was being used for agro.  So I found a weapon with a +5 magic damage.<br />
Initial Agro + three force of Akera<br />
Changed to 18+5/38 <br />
1	28<br />
2	27<br />
3	28<br />
<br />
According to these tests this weapon is as much agro as a 23/38 weapon.  23 + 40 = 63  63 * 27 = 1701 which is about right for three force of Akera and initial agro.  Yes, this conclusion is a tad loose.  But I am really tired atm.  But I still think we can safely say that +5 of the resistance types are effectively the same as +5 weapon damage as far as agro generation is concerned where as BANE TYPE DAMAGE IS NOT.  (See first post.)<br />
<br />
Hate values are different per class, for you Brodda it appears that monks have a smaller hate modifier than Knights, atleast on 2h weapons, and it is larger on 1h.<br />
<br />
I found this interesting so I wanted to test it.  I grabbed a warrior.<br />
<br />
With warrior<br />
Initial Agro + two force of Akera<br />
15/32 secondary<br />
1	71<br />
2	71<br />
<br />
15/32 primary<br />
1	39<br />
2	38<br />
<br />
13/50<br />
1	19<br />
2	19<br />
<br />
As you can see, it is the same as the monk.  So I find that Brael's conclusion wrong at least for warriors and monks.  I did go to your link though, and I can't find fault with any of your conclusions there.  The only thing I can think of is that the hate generated by the spell was somehow different than the hate it generated for me.  Mob differences?  /shrug.  It is still all relative.<br />
<br />
I think if someone really went through all the data with a fine toothed comb they could probably figure out what exactly was going on.  But I am far too tired to do so and I won't pursue this any further as far as me logging data goes.</div></div><hr />

2 193<br />
<br />
Let X be the aggro from a 8/20 per swing.<br />
Let I be the initial aggro, A be the aggro from the first force of Akera, B from the second and C from the third.<br />
<br />
Then what you have proved is:<br />
5 X &lt;= I &lt;= 6 X<br />
67 X &lt;= I + A &lt;= 68 X<br />
131 X &lt;= I + A + B &lt;= 132 X<br />
192 X &lt;= I + A + B + C &lt;= 193 X<br />
<br />
First question: is this consistend with A = B = C = Force of Ak aggro<br />
Let us assume F is all of A B and C.  Then<br />
<br />
1) 5 X &lt;= I &lt;= 6 X<br />
2) 67 X &lt;= I + F &lt;= 68 X<br />
3) 131 X &lt;= I + 2 F &lt;= 132 X<br />
4) 192 X &lt;= I + 3 F &lt;= 193 X<br />
<br />
1 &amp; 2 give:<br />
61 X &lt;= F &lt;= 63 X<br />
1 &amp; 3 give:<br />
62.5 X &lt;= F &lt;= 63.5 X<br />
1 &amp; 4 give:<br />
62 X &lt;= F &lt;= 62.667<br />
<br />
Together we get<br />
5) 62.5 X &lt;= F &lt;= 62.667 X<br />
<br />
now, 2 and 5 give us:<br />
4.333 X &lt;= I &lt;= 5.5 X<br />
with 1 this becomes<br />
5 X &lt;= I &lt;= 5.5 X<br />
<br />
Plug this into (3) and we get<br />
62.75 X &lt;= F &lt;= 63.5 X<br />
which together with (5) provides us with a contradiction.<br />
<br />
Thus proving our aggro model is flawed or incomplete.  There is an additional source of aggro wandering around that isn't accounted for.<br />
<br />
Dispite this additional unknown aggro source, it was really damn close to linear.<br />
<br />
I'll take as a rule of thumb that<br />
raw stun aggro =~ 62.5 offhand swings of an 8 damage weapon.<br />
Initial aggro =~ 5.5 offhand swings of an 8 damage weapon.<br />
<br />
which gives us<br />
108 DD component of QWoS =~ 17 offhand swings of an 8 damage weapon. (+/-)<br />
<br />
from your second set of tests.<br />
<br />
Changed to 9/36 in offhand<br />
Initial Agro + force of Akera<br />
1 62<br />
2 63<br />
3 62<br />
<br />
Let Y be the aggro from a 9 damage weapon in offhand.<br />
<br />
Lets assume that the offhand swing has some &quot;base&quot; aggro and some aggro that is purportional to the weapon damage.  The base aggro might be zero.<br />
<br />
So,<br />
Y = B + 9 * D<br />
X = B + 8 * D<br />
<br />
The above test says:<br />
61 Y &lt;= I + F &lt;= 62 Y<br />
The test with the 8 damage in offhand weapon says:<br />
67 X &lt;= I + F &lt;= 68 X<br />
<br />
Rearranging we get<br />
61 Y &lt;= 68 X<br />
67 X &lt;= 62 Y<br />
<br />
Using the B + # * D equations, we get<br />
61 B + 549 D &lt;= 68 B + 544 D<br />
67 B + 536 D &lt;= 62 B + 558 D<br />
or<br />
5 D &lt;= 7 B<br />
5 B &lt;= 22 D<br />
0.71 D &lt;= B &lt;= 4.4 D<br />
<br />
Ie, aggro from offhand swings is not quite just purportional to weapon damage.  There is a small additional component, between .71 raw-damage-aggro worth and 4.4 raw-damage-aggro worth.<br />
<br />
From:<br />
Changed to 9/36 in primary<br />
1 49<br />
2 49<br />
<br />
Changed to 8/20 in primary<br />
1 54<br />
2 55<br />
<br />
These numbers are scary.<br />
<br />
The extra 1 point of damage-aggro from 49 swings out aggroed 4 full rounds of an 8 damage weapon (round 50 51 52 and 53).<br />
<br />
So:<br />
49 * &quot;Aggro Per Point Of Weapon Damage&quot; &gt;= 4 * &quot;Mainhand Base Aggro&quot; + 32 * &quot;Aggro Per Point Of Weapon Damage&quot;<br />
17 &quot;Aggro Per Point Of Weapon Damage&quot; &gt;= 4 * &quot;Mainhand Base Aggro&quot;<br />
4.25 &quot;Aggro Per Point Of Weapon Damage &gt;= &quot;Mainhand Base Aggro&quot;<br />
<br />
which means the &quot;damage bonus aggro&quot; isn't nearly as large as we thought, if aggro is linear in weapon damage and in damage bonus.<br />
<br />
Man, reverse engeneering is hard.</div></div><hr />

Just using those <br />
weapon_damage + damage_bonus <br />
seemed to be a good *relative* indicator for hate generated per a swing.  even in offhand.  I tried combinations using min damage per a hit and it only exaggerated the error.<br />
<br />
for example the 9/36 generates 2.04% of the hate needed per a swing. now we want to predict how much hate the 8 weapon will generate per a swing.<br />
<br />
according to the theory the 9 damages hate per a swing is 22 and the 8 damages hate per a swing is 21.  so we expect the 8 damage to generate 2.04% X 21/22 = 1.947 % of the total hate per a swing.<br />
which means it would need 51 swings in actuality it needed 54 so boo me but its close =)<br />
<br />
moving on.  the 15/32 is expected to generate 2.04% * 28/21 =2.72% per a swing which predicts 36.8 swings to generate 100% agro.  in actuality its  39 swings.  again error.<br />
<br />
Now your thinking why did i post if theres error.<br />
well because it keeps up with offhand =)<br />
offhand has no damage bonus.<br />
so its expected to generate 2.04* 15/21 = 1.45% of the total agro needed per a swing.  predicting 68.6 swings to get agro.  in actuality its 71.  2.5 swings off.<br />
<br />
Not bad really for a theory that unifys offhand and mainhand into an approximation.<br />
<br />
im sure theres some combination of those numbers that is the real equation but for now base_damage + damage_bonus/delay seems to unify main/offhand into one agro detirmined package.  I mean all the predicted relative delays were less then 3 swings off.</div></div><hr />

(weapondamage + damage_bonus)/delay can be used to predict what weapons generate the most agro without procs.  the higher the number the better.<br />
<br />
some test numbers (damage/delay) show..<br />
12/17(1.47agro) &gt;14/19 (1.42agro) &gt;15/20 (1.4agro) &gt; 13/19 (1.37 agro)<br />
<br />
The most interesting prediction there is the 14/19 out agroing the 15/20.  that would be an interesting test but note how small the differential is.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also one last shocking note.  and your not going to like it.<br />
according to the data the only thing that matters for agro offhand is ratio.  meaning things like defenders lightblade are big agro offhand.<br />
<br />
some one needs to get some more offhand data.  ill try to find somemore.  thats an interesting result.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">qutsemnie</div><div class="date">11-10-2003, 09:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok yep theres more supporting data.<br />
<br />
take the 8 damage weapon versus the 9 damage weapon versus intial agro + 1 force.<br />
<br />
the 8 damage weapon took 68 swings offhand.  according to the theory i advanced the only thing that matters offhand is weapon damage for agro.  so its 1.47% of the agro total needed per a swing x 9/8 for agro per a swing of the 9 damage weapon. <br />
So the 9 damage weapon offhand does 1.654% agro needed per a swing offhand (predicted).  predicting  60.45 swings with the 9 damage weapon to generate the same agro.<br />
in actuality it was 62.3.<br />
<br />
Pretty tight correlation.<br />
<br />
So the only thing that matters per a swing offhand is base weapon damage.  So the only thing that matters offhand for agro generation per a minute (minus proc) is ratio.  <br />
<br />
So those warriors offhand defenders lightblade that you laughed at....  are laughing now....<br />
<br />
I wouldnt have believed it either but thats what the data is saying about offhand agro.  Offhand agro over time is ratio and nothing else.<br />
<br />
<br />
PREDICTION!<br />
<br />
If the person that did the Initial Agro + one force of Akera agro wants to get a defenders lightblade.  I hereby predict that it will take the defenders lightblade  27 swings  to get agro offhand against an initial agro + force of akera.<br />
<br />
(the actual numbers said 25.5 but i bumped it 1.5 swings cause the equation seems shifted down a swing or two but still predicting)<br />
<br />
Cant beat that for not cooking the data~</div></div><hr />

From the data I've gathered so far it appears Spell Casting Subtlety AA lowers melee aggro generation as well (confirmed on my tests that it was SCS and not Terror causing lower aggro generation).  I posted some more data on my thread but I don't think it will do a whole lot of good right now considering its got a modifier on it lowering aggro generation, probally 20% but who knows...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dual weilding a 14/18 main hand, and 13/20 off hand would generate less agro then a 31/30 2 hander? (with no procs)<br />

Data so far basically suggest the mainhand dominates. <br />
Still though there might be a second behavior for twohanders. A nerf of there agro is a possibility.  No reason to think that though till (weapon_damage + damage bonus) fails to predict their swings. The only reason i didnt check previous twohanders already provided is cause im not fimiliar with the damage bonuses for twohand weapons off the top of my head(im a rogue)</div></div><hr />

I looked up a damage bonus on a 50 delay weapon... well i looked up the equation... its 27 or 28 right?  Im  guessing 27 and proceeding like it was.  anyone know the damage bonus for a 50 delay weapon at 65?<br />
<br />
the 12/50 took 34.5 swings to generate 100% of the agro to get the mob to turn.  thats 2.898% of the agro per a swing.  Now according to the theory 2.898% X 49/39 = 3.64% of the agro per a swing.  predicting 27.4 swings when in actuality its 30.5.  3 swings off.  but thats a 10% error so not good.  <br />
<br />
Note:<br />
error would go down if the Damage Bonus was 28 instead of 27 on a 50 delay weapon but not by alot.  <br />
I must figure out this almost constant shift down im getting in my predictions.  Its like it works if you add 2 swings in every case~<br />

but i punched in 51 which lucy says is the damage bonus for a 50 delay weapon and something wierd happen cause i had all the equations set up to cascade the change.  and there was a dead on correlation at a wierd but interesting spot.<br />

my tightest correlation was at <br />
<br />
twohand weapon agro is<br />
weapon_damage + twohander_damage_bonus + single_weapon_damage_bonus<br />
<br />
thats per a swing<br />

Which seems like it makes NO SENSE but its actually symetrical with the single hand weapons tighest correlation which was best at<br />
singlehand weapon agro is<br />
weapon_damage + damage_bonus + 1<br />

That was the data i used. its only two weapons so definatly need more.  Ill walk you through the prediction.<br />
The 12 delay weapon generates 2.898% of the agro it needs per a swing.  Then 2.898% X 86/76 =  3.279 % agro generated per a swing predicted from damage + twohandbonus + singlebonus predicting 30.49 swings for the 22/50 to get agro.<br />
<br />
which it is =)</div></div><hr />

Cily<br />
<br />
<br />
note that was with old equations.  lets see what the new tighter ones predict.<br />
<br />
14/18 = (14+13+1)/18 = 1.556<br />
13/20 secondary = (13+1)/20 = .7<br />
Total 2.256<br />
<br />
31/30 = (31+36+13)/30  = 2.667<br />
<br />
<br />
NOW Digression.  I been debating over something critical here for hours.  Not heavy debate just a nagging thing.  Did we unify the single weapon and twohand equations so that we know they are in the same units of agro per a time?<br />
I been debating on that for sometime.  Ive always leaned towards yes but for some reason the proof doesnt stand out to me.  Ill think on the proof but my nagging suspicion is that its there and those are in the same units.<br />
<br />
grr its still nagging at me whether these two numbers are directly comparable.  i cant find a twohander test being compared to the same amount of agro from a single weapon test.  this is a big question!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brodda Thep</div><div class="date">11-11-2003, 11:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">weapon_damage + twohander_damage_bonus + single_weapon_damage_bonus<br />
This has to be wrong.  If it was true then 20 delay two handers would be on of the best agro generators out there.  But they aren't.  I know that is anecdotal evidence, but it is just that easy to tell.<br />
<br />
Also, I made a mistake and it was a 13/50 in my original tests.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">qutsemnie</div><div class="date">11-11-2003, 12:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hmm thats not what the equation says.<br />
<br />
if anything is going to be best agro it would be the 28 delay weapon<br />
<br />
for example lets compare theoretical even ratio weapons with http://lucy.fnord.net/dmgbonus.html<br />
<br />
then the 20/20 twohander would be<br />
(20+14+13)/20 = 2.35<br />
28/28 is (28+35+13)/28 = 2.714<br />
31/31 is (31+36+13)/31 = 2.58<br />
40/40 is (40+42+13)/40 = 2.375<br />
<br />
showing pretty clearing that the best 1.0 ratio 2hander for agro is 28/28  (actually could have derived an equation)<br />
<br />
But things like 39/31 are going to beat a 28/28<br />
39/31 is (39+36+13)/31 = 2.83<br />
which means the world isnt turned upside down =)<br />
<br />
<br />
the most interesting thing so far has been the data that ratio and not speed is what detirmins best agro for offhander.  Thats straight into the face of some stuff being posted for newbie advice just a few forums over.  But it doesnt seem to be in doubt.  theres enough data to make that conclusion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Feysboil</div><div class="date">11-11-2003, 01:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is it possible that aggro is a composite of several different things, and that we're sniffing around one tree, when we've really got raccoons treed in two or more different trees?<br />
<br />
For example, the initial tests seemed pretty convincing that hate was a fixed amount (within a small range) per swing, and that it was related to a weapon's damage/delay stats.<br />
<br />
Then, it became evident that that theory is not entirely consistent across a wide spectrum of weapons (because the theoretical model doesn't mirror what we all know from practical experience).  So there are two possibilities:<br />
<br />
1) The original theory is completely wrong, and any semblance of validity is a startling coincidence.<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
2) The original theory is very close, thanks to a fortuitous use of weapons that are highly representative of the model, but there is some other amount of hate coming from somewhere that is too complex to reverse-engineer.<br />
<br />
For instance... perhaps the hate IS based on the weapon as originally postulated, but there is an additional amount of hate being generated using a different formula which scales in some way that is undetectable with the small sample of weapons tested thus far?  Maybe the amount of damage being done does generate hate, but depending on some variables (like weapon damage, damage bonus or delay) has a multiplier which practically negates the effects of added hate from damage done.  Or maybe each weapon has some hate multiplier, and most weapons have a multiplier of 1.0 or very close to it.<br />
<br />
I think the best way to proceed would be to continue to conduct these tests with a vast variety of weapons, and tabulate the pertinent information: damage, delay, damage bonus, number of hits to take 1 ToT's worth of aggro, total damage dealt in that time.<br />
<br />
There's also one other factor to consider, and that's decay.  Does hate decay over time?  Perhaps the variations seen have something to do with how much time it's taking to steal aggro.  For instance, with weapon A you take aggro back with 10 attacks, but weapon B seems to consistently take 40 swings to gain aggro.  Assuming the times are different there, is it possible that  if hate decays over time, you're really not stealing 1 ToT of aggro, you're stealing (1 - (Decay Rate * time)) ToT.  For longer periods of time taken to gain aggro, the amount being overcome might be considerably less than the fixed 510 we're taking as granted.<br />
<br />
So let's say hate decays a 10 hate/second (just for sake of argument).  Furthermore, we'll assume that 10 attacks with weapon A takes 10 seconds, and 40 attacks with weapon B takes 25 seconds.<br />
<br />
Weapon A: <br />
<br />
Hate Overcome = 510 - (10 hate/sec * 10 sec) = 410 hate to overcome decaying hate<br />
<br />
Weapon B:<br />
<br />
Hate Overcome = 510 - (10 hate/sec * 25 sec) = 260 hate overcome.<br />
<br />
This kind of variation could account for differences observed as well.  I'm not aware of any studies done as yet that conclusively prove or disprove whether hate decays at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agro decay has been shown not to exist by wizards.  You will have to search their forums though.  They also have a great thread by Istari (?) about hate from spells.  <br />
<br />
What probably led to the theory of agro decay was mobs that will typically clear their agro list after every 5-6min.</div></div><hr />

Well, then a lot of typing by me was wasted... but thanks for confirming what I thought may have been true anyway.<br />
<br />
What about the other points I mentioned, about secondary sources of hate or multipliers based on specific weapons?</div></div><hr />

the data points are so bad that the little change from 12 damage to 13 damage as it was revealed  made it so with twohanders<br />
weapon_damage + damage_bonus + 1 is closer (really close) then <br />
weapon_damage + damage_bonus  + single_hand_damagebonus<br />
<br />
which is nice cause thats the same approximation that singlehand weapons are using. But they arnt dead on and +2 instead of +1 is a tad closer for the twohand weapons.  But neither is exact.<br />

This unfortunatly will have to be placed in &quot;developing&quot; until someone gets more data.</div></div><hr />

Back to my original theory of dmg+(bonus*mod) now which seems to hold true for weapons from 37-49 delay, There are 3 different dmg bonus formulas in the game right now it's possible theres 3 formulas for modified aggro as well.  One for extremly high delay weapons, one for normal weapons, and one for very fast weapons.  With the modifier being largest on the high delay and lowest on the fast ones.</div></div><hr />
