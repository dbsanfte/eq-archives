<br />
heard it was about 4,000 kills to get indif.  first question... how many to get amiable?  <br />
<br />
i have heard of modifying your faction via tricksters augmentation, is this true.  also been told i can use a wood elf potion to get faction up.  how much faction does these illusions give?  <br />
<br />
also what faction is needed to get the crown in the end? warmly?<br />
<br />
another question... what faction do u have when u cham a mob.  i can shell out some cash for some puppet strings and do that for the turn in.<br />
<br />
so in theory i could charm the quest mob go lets say amiable, then get warmly via illusion.  is the possable?<br />
<br />
as u can see im lazy and want this thing as fast as i can. :)<br />
<br />
many thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tricksters Augmentation does not work anymore after the illusion nerf that was supposed to fix some faction issues (it just made alot of illusions useless too).<br />
<br />
I think you need Ally to get the crown.<br />
<br />
Charm will make the &quot;pet&quot; amiably to you at all times, so its not usable.<br />
<br />
Best way seems to be an illusion wood elf potion or project wood elf from your local enchanter and then lots of faction killing.</div></div><hr />

As far as a physical number, it is a hard one. In the end you need ally. A Ghoul Lord Scalp will take you from Warmly to Ally, it did for my ogre. Easy camp and spawn of Ghoul Lord or Placeholder is every 28 minutes. <br />
<br />
If your race is evil but cannot wear the scalp, I am pretty certain that a potion of illusion: Wood Elf  can take you to ALLY from Warmly also. May be the quicker way, jusy buy one and find out.<br />
For faction, just goto Sebilis with friends and fight until you recieve &quot;Your faction standing with Froglocks of Guk could not possibly get any better&quot;. <br />
<br />
The froglock reet crown is a pain in the a$$. My friend and I got one between 4 and 8 hours. We spent the next week (35-40 hours total) waiting for the 3rd to drop for my wife's halfling cleric. So, its pretty frickin random to say the least. High point is you can get other loot drops while down there, I got a Cobalt Bracer on the clearing of Mycos on the way to Reets/Juggs on the 4th day. Got a Cobalt helm that went to the Baz Trader on the 5th day. Undead dragon sinew for Spirit Wracked Cords from Juggs ( had about 8 of these drop in that week) . Made atleast 300pp per night per person off of jewel loots, and I outfitted my guild (casual guild) with over 70 spells lvl 57-60. There is something down there for everyone, and I pinged 3 aa's down there.<br />
<br />
Goodluck and be patient. The WE night vision is superior to my ogres, and it screws with the noobs when I transform at will.</div></div><hr />
