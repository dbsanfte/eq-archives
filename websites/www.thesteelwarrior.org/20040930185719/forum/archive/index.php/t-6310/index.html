<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zotha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So, did anyone else do Time today and notice that certain mobs like to fall out of the walls when cornered? Tallon, Vallon, CT, Bertox and rallos all warped to spawn at least once after being pushed through a wall/corner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>salandius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">emp in ssra is no longer corner tankable... <br />
<br />
<br />
he would get pushed into the wall then turn toward the raid and summon the tank into the wall, then the game would pop the tank to safespot in the zone... we ended up having to pull emp into the middle and box him</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kadah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">same with PoAir Avatar's, Much fun fun getting yanked through the wall droped to iZ and summoned back to room in 5 seconds @@</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bohkah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">We had the Custodian in Righteousness warp to bind on us when he got too close to a wall.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kunis Marfury</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">mmm my guild should redo aow this week end (ya ! we are a bit late :p), might be fun if he's no longer cornerable :D<br />
<br />
i'll keep in touch for KT, vindic, idol and so on as soon as sébilis is patched too</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Brudal the Fat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">same kind of warping for us on Vallon in time. We pinned Tallon in the corner same as always with no problems though. Vallon however, despite tryin several corners warped everytime 1 foot wasn't visable (read: in the wall). That wiped us over and over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>uniad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Did Bert last night in CT room and i got pushed through wall at50%, other tank got pushed through wall at 11%. Needless to say we lost. Moved Bert over to NW cornwer where it is actually a 90 degree angle and instead of walking into corner just walked into 1 of the walls. Worked jsut fine. Now if i could get my healers to keep me alive we'd be ok!!<br />
<br />
UNIAD</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tugurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Collisions are messed up. In VT last night melees getting tossed by blobs would end up in either a giant, unmoveable pile stuck on the MTs head, or jammed into a wall. Several times I got tossed up to the ceiling and simply never came back down. Would take long minutes of ducking, sliding, twisting, etc, to wriggle free and fall back down. <br />
<br />
And at least 3 times the MT got pushed through a wall and popped back to zone in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hopefully they will get this worked out.  Trust me, it's much better now than when it first went on test.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kalamurv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">was backflagging bert last night and both me and him warped to zone in lolz</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">huge surprise for anyone xping at zone in I bet lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Valaden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Anyone get to try RZTWL since the patch to see if he goes through the wall too?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">had some problems with the chiefs in poeb. they wouldnt corner nicely and then they would summon you out of corner and in doing so they would turn to face raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jarelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Tonight PoWater...Hydrotha, pushed into a wall, spawned back at pop point....came back with a lot of friends :(<br />
<br />
PoFire, Quavonis wasn't pullable, Blazzax kept pinging back as he ran towards raid, then warped right on top of us, Reparm while trying to corner him merged through the wall, began summoning...so we AE Tled out and gave up.<br />
<br />
It's all very messed up atm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kilzalot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Watched them pull Pyronis in fire last night and he was bouncing all over the place.  Also had issues with Fennin Ro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Hikhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">We cleared PoFire yesterday (except mini general &amp; FR which wasnt up), we had issues not only with mobs ignoring walls but also got stuck on corpses. and even on what looked like &quot;clear flat ground&quot;. The best way to pull em all was by making em warp forward over obstacles, the downside was thet you lost a puller / warp.<br />
<br />
<br />
This &quot;thing&quot; that got mobs stuck on all small raises actully worked to our advantage then we killed MM later this night. There is a small raise of the floor around the MM room. This small raise in teh floor was impossible for MM to walk up over so we was able to cornertank him in the NE corner without him ever touching the walls (The rangers in guild was waaaay to happy about this)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Krassus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Time VZ was fun<br />
<br />
Pulled to corner tanked 70% warp to bind, full health. Repeat ....... tried fighting him in the open and he eventually touched a wall and went in it. Tanks summoned fell through world</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Dakryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">We had same problem with cornering VZ/Saryrn/TT, had to fight them out in the open sort of.<br />
Took one group to ST later, cleared down to the warders, got there and then when fighting the warders I got summoned and sent to the zone in because I got summoned under the world etc.<br />
Cleric got eaten with no tank there and we wound up having to call it after it happened again on a second attempt</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Krassus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Its so different for everyone, we have had 0 problems on Saryn, TT, TZ in time it was actually way better since rangers could DPS more so now. VZ though was a mess, he was warping from the table to the corner then back, we had to repull a few times after he healed to full and just gave up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Dakryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Actually was our first Time VZ kill too, go figure. with the bugs we still beat him. (Welcome to Phase 5 us)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Celestias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">QUARM SUCKS NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>seveirn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Agree on the quarm thing.. He wont even get near a wall for us, He's still in the like.. middle area ppl gettin AEd when it should be blocked =/<br />
<br />
Also did RZTW, cornored no problems.. altho again never really touched the wall, so a little Negotiating of AE ramp was needed.<br />
<br />
Inny in Time, Accually made it easyer  He was if you wana put it this way mabye Arm length from the wall never touched it, range attacks worked =P<br />
<br />
RZ time , bit of a prob of whem going half way into wall<br />
Bertox: ugh Got stuck on the Middle Table, then warped on the clerics.<br />
<br />
<br />
Have'nt fought vallon since collistion probs, only tallon. which went fine</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Hikhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">The patch yesterday did it fix anything up in time? We are off for our turn in time this sunday so it would be nice to see what's up in store for us. (We been able to kill all mobs in phase 5 except Inno so far.)<br />
<br />
From what I saw from our PoEb fights the mobs seems to stay quite a bit away from the walls and is impossible to push in. Is this general in all zones or was we just lucky? (We just killed the 4 mobs before the RC for loot)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Choppin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">tallon / saryrn / TT went fine for us yesterday<br />
<br />
vallon was a complete mess with him getting stuck on the table during pull, being pushed into the wall so no melee could hit him, and then warping etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>zhakran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Guild was in Fire yesterday....horribly uncool there as well. <br />
<br />
Had to fight Fennin the open, against the invis wall was a total disaster...I got shoved through a wall tanking Blazzax as well, and the pathing? Damn....pulling was a nightmare, the monks and bards were literally in tears with the crazy places mobs would get stuck....and of course it wouldnt let you cast on them when they're in a wall or in the floor. <br />
<br />
All in all....GOOD TIMES...<br />
<br />
Wait no, not at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Brudal the Fat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">VZ(time) sucks now. We only recently started in time and we been now 3 turns. VZ would have went down this last time if that warp crap wasn't going on. TZ is the easiest fight now, very fast and clean in the corner no warping. Saryrn fight although it went smooth it looked like she was on some cloud of air during the fight (her feet were not on the ground and when she would swing her entire body would tilt evenly as if the grounds itself tipped her forward) but there was no warping or wall problems. TT was fine in the corner to.<br />
<br />
Also while setting up for Vallon we had several clerics fall to their death and land in phase 5 just standing near the wall in his room, very frustrating. I hope they did fix it though. We go again on monday so I will not know till then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Kelsya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">We had problems with Saryrn-Time, TZ-Time and VZ-Time getting stuck inside the wall, and any attempt to pull them out would result in them warping back to spawn. <br />
<br />
Quarm was the worst, the first time we got Quarm stuck in the wall we were unable to hit or attack it in any way even after we pulled it out. The next try had to be done out in the middle, blasting everyone with the lovely AE. <br />
<br />
After the &quot;fix-it&quot; patch, while tanking TZ-Time in the corner, I noticed a forced pathing forward of about 4 feet if I had my screen tilted up. With your screen facing full forward it was not a problem, but if you tilt up, you would find yourself warping forward. Luckily, the lag from facing the entire raid is not bad anymore, so tilting up is more habit than anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Thalzaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Last night we did earthb for some loot and couple things i noticed as mentioned above. All the named were cornered, however, there was a space around them that seemed to prevent them from being pushed into the walls. The rangers were very pleased with this.<br />
<br />
Now, i played around with the walls in earthb and noticed a couple of things. If i backed up into a wall, i would get warped a couple feet, but if i continually pressed the walk backwards key against a wall, i wouldn't get warped.<br />
<br />
Got time this sunday so hopefully the collisions get fix before then &gt;&lt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Dakryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">yeah the &quot;rubber band&quot; effect on walls now is very annoying</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Kelsya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I was still having problems with the &quot;rubber band&quot; effect while continuously walking backwards into the wall. The only thing that seemed to help with this was to have the screen facing full frontal with no tilt adjustments.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Dracillion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Tanked RZ tonight and when he was at 2% I got shoved through the wall and then popped back at the ZI a bit later.  Our pullers had problems with Quovanis in Fire too, but they modified their strat and got him too us.  Sony seriously messed something up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Jarelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">We still can't work out how to pull Quavonis, so we've given up on him twice now. Pulled Pyronis to the safe spot outside c2 last night, he warped back to spawn 3 times before he finally warped near raid, I pressed incite, and he seemed to get stuck on the ledge. So we basically had a static Pyro which made him easier than normal. I just stood 1 side everyone else stood behind him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">today on regular bertoxx he got pushed into wall attacked and killed some people while noone could hit him, then went under the world and stayed there till he despawned. this after our raid had been trained right before bert pull by people trying to backflag that we told not to come. huge fuckin 2 hour waste</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Bloodeus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">We tried fat illusion on MT (ogre or troll non shrunk) and got no more problems with cornered named ending in wall ! <br />
<br />
It allowed us to kill our first time VZ 2 days ago. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>zhakran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">anyone done PoWater recently? boy that was neat, I can basically swim into the walls at any place in the zone. <br />
<br />
Was doing a tpit trial today as well, and backed up against a wall, I fell and found myself at the zone in.....This shit needs fixed, it's simply atrocious. I haven't been playing this game overly long, but never have I seen so many bugs as right now. I dont really have any huge urge for WoW right now, but each day crap like this goes on makes it seem more appealing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Kelsya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">This is just raiding. It doesn't even hit on the *inconveniences* like constantly falling under the world practically every time you zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Frax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">I fell under the world in Natimbi.. not by zoning, not by touching a wall... but by having  Spirit of Eagle cast on me and instantly I warped to the the safepoint under the world.<br />
<br />
in addtion zoning into Kod'taz is ugly now, especially if you have levitation on or someone is stupid enough to be afk at the zone in point (which of course is more common than you'd think).. it warps you above the 'ceiling' in the zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Lessiter1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Anyone get to try RZTWL since the patch to see if he goes through the wall too?<br />
<br />
We went through 2 tanks dying to 20k falls on Saturday.<br />
<br />
Later one of the PoA dust ring spiders warped under the world and started summoning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">PoWater is real interesting.  Normal sized mobs seemed ok against tunnel walls.  But in the larger chambers, any wall = port to zone in, and any larger creature = pop thru wall like it's not there.  We even managed to get Grioihin the Wise's head stuck in the ceiling for a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Hikhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Did Quarm yesterday in 3 matches rounds. First round we got him to 42 %, and thiught we would get him the next time we tried. Problem was that then we pulled him he is warping instead of walking after the puller. Since this was the first time we done Quarm I dont know if its the norm for quarm. Anyway,  on the second try we did, the puller walked up on the slope on the cave and Quarm ended up in the wall so we wiped quite badly since as someone else reported he have no problem at all to hit the raidforce but we aint allowed to hit him. (Cheating bugger!)<br />
<br />
So untill they fix the wallproblem I can recommend to force the puller to stand on the flat part of the cavefloor to avoid the wall problems.<br />
<br />
We did him a 3rd time and got him to 16 % before we ran out of time. (The reason we ran out of time was that we waited for the MGB's to reset after try nr 2 for the extra healing, kinda ironic since we didnt need em)<br />
<br />
Hopefully todays patch will solve all this, but this is pure speculations, in 5h we will know for shure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Cyprex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Any one update on walls since servers been up for some time? Got RZTW tonight, that will be fun with out using a corner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Choppin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">VZ went fine today, but cornering Cazic was fucked, he went inside the walls but we were able to melee him. We used the NW corner inside the port up room. At least he didn't warp to spawn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>xabel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">after march 30th patch no problem cornering time RZ, didn't need ogre illusion or anything so I assume its fixed</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Only good thing about having cornering fucked up was that it made the fights a little more interesting/fun.</div></div><hr />
