<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Steenky</div><div class="date">01-15-2004, 10:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've read quite a few threads about AA progression, but I've never seen this question answered.<br />
<br />
Currently I have gotten in this order:<br />
<br />
Run3<br />
Sta3<br />
Ing1 (I had a free point in my early 60's so thought what the heck)<br />
ND3<br />
AE Taunt<br />
CA2<br />
CS2<br />
PE<br />
PD3<br />
<br />
I have about 2.5 AA's banked at the moment and haven't been getting alot lately. I guess working on the 6 point ones has taken the wind out of my sails so to speak. This being the case, which would you get first knowing it may be a couple of weeks before the other?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zigglewort</div><div class="date">01-15-2004, 10:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally, I would do CA3, LR5, then CS3.  Avoiding the hits are going to be better and LR is such a vast improvement over CA that it will be worth waiting to get CS3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sardaan</div><div class="date">01-15-2004, 11:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">LR5 &gt; all<br />
<br />
in the long run, ID5 and LR5 save about the same amount of damage... with one exception. Procs. NPC's need to actually hit you to proc, unlike PC procs where you don't actually need to hit the mob. So going the avoidance route will pay off in terms of proc damage avoidance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Steenky</div><div class="date">01-15-2004, 11:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks alot for the advice.<br />
<br />
I never would've thought to skip CS3 in favor of working up LR, but it makes sense. One other thing, are all the 5 levels of LR 3 points each or do they scale up like old AA's?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">01-16-2004, 12:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The benefits of CA3 and CS3 are roughly equal.  People prefer Combat Agility 3 because it's something you can see but hoenstly they're roughly the same.  If you're just getting these AAs you're certainly not fighting anything where avoiding the procs makes a significant change to enemy DPS output.<br />
<br />
It doesn't matter which order you do them since the defensive AAs have pretty much fixed gains per AA but I got the CS/CA out of the way first before working on their planar counterparts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">01-16-2004, 01:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Phantron is right.  If it was me, do CA3(it is very slightly better, unless you are tanking alot of mobs that proc, and even then it not huge), then CS3, then LR5, then ID5.  You get slightly more bang for your buck with CA/CS than LR/ID(each reduce damage incoming by same amount, CA/CS for 12 points, LR/ID for 15).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sardaan</div><div class="date">01-16-2004, 02:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One other thing, are all the 5 levels of LR 3 points each or do they scale up like old AA's? <br />
<br />
3 points per level<br />
<br />
so LR1 - LR5 costs 15AA total</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zynth</div><div class="date">01-16-2004, 04:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i did CS first, then CA, and ID followed by LR. i usually lasted longer against larger mobs than the other tanks that did the oppisite. i was getting hit alot, but it was for such pathetic damage half the time i was hardly at 50% when a CH landed. i'm iksar tho, and have always focused on high AC. my belief is that if your tanking, your going to get hit anyway, so you should lower the damage. but like stated before, they are roughly going to give you the same advantage over the long run.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Uukla</div><div class="date">01-16-2004, 04:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">6 AA to get 5 percent mitigation for both CA3 and CS3<br />
15 AA to get 5 eprcent mitigation for both LR5 and ID5<br />
<br />
the agility abilties allow you to miss the procs on swings that dont connect, but something to keep in mind is that CS and ID allow for more smooth damage incoming rather than more spikey damage incoming with agility.<br />
<br />
IMO, CA3 CS3 LR5 ID5<br />
<br />
Those who hail LR5 over CS3 fail to look at the parses that show pretty much the percentages of damage not taken are equal, and are just having bad flashbacks of Raxx harm touching thier ass for 4k.  Ive seen at least 2 parses that show CS 3 means 5 percent less damage incoming over CS2, and the exact same result for 5 levels of LR.<br />
(yes, for raid tanking ID5 &gt; CS5, but you aint raid tanking to get all them AA points, you are grinding them out in EXP groups, and in that situation, its best to get the best AA / mitigation % possible)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">01-16-2004, 05:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well the way I look at it is this.  You get 10% more HP for 12 AAs into durability 3 as opposed to 4.5% more HPs for 9 AAs in Planar Durability.  Since Durability/Stability/Agility are the core defense AAs it stands to reason they should have simlar returns and so it'd appear that the arch defensive AAs get better return for the AA invested than the Planar counterparts.  Since there aren't any logs I know of that directly compares the planar defensive AAs to the arch defensive AAs, I use durability as the baseline.  <br />
<br />
And none of the AAs will make you a tanking machine overnight.  Don't expect just because you have stability 3 or agility 3 that you're suddenly twice the tank you were before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">01-16-2004, 06:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is hypothetical, as I haven't parsed it, but isn't it likely that higher ac would make CS more effective? It increases your mitigation by X% (depending on the level), and ac seems to make you more likely to mitigate hits to begin with. If this is the case, then CS would be more useful if you had higher ac. If CS is independent of ac, then I completely agree with the above statements of CA3, CS3, LR5, ID5.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raunstonecutter</div><div class="date">01-16-2004, 06:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I vote CS/LR first.  If nothing else, I felt much better about my tanking with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">01-16-2004, 07:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is time to break out the Sscaley parse, from this (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=2259)  thread in The Library.  The following quotes are from there:<br />
<br />
Which is to say, that going from ID0 to ID5 (on Valorian Guards in HoH) will net you an average 15hp/hit mitigation - which is roughly 15/2.87 = 5.2% decrease in damage taken. Given the linearity of ID cost, I'd wager a round of beer that it's intended to give you ~1% of damage per skill level (or ~4% for an increase from DI1 to DI5, for comparison).<br />
<br />
Going from LR1 to LR5 will increase your avoidance by 3%, from 32% misses to 35% misses. Miss+Hit at LR1 is 85.6% of the swings, while Miss+Hit at LR5 is 85.8% of swings. 32% of 85.6% is 37.4% of damage avoided while 35% of 85.8% is 40.8% of damage avoided - or about a 4%-point increase in damage avoided.<br />
<br />
From this little test, I would hypothesise that ID and LR are about the same efficiency in reducing total damage taken - however, LR will make you get hit less which can affect any innate proc related additional damage/stuns. <br />
<br />
IIRC, CA3 has about an equal effect as LR5, and CS3 has about an equal effect as ID5.  CA and CS cost 12 points each to get that effect, while LR and ID cost 15 points.  You will want them all, so order is not hugely important, but if you are a min/max type, probably the best order is CA3, CS3, LR5, ID5.<br />
<br />
As always, all hail Sscaley for his awesome work giving us this information!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Korinn_emarr</div><div class="date">01-16-2004, 09:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd go CA3, CS3, LR5, ID5.  Reason being is because you get more benefit from the 10% extra midigatin than you would if you went LR5 after CA3 for the extra 5% avoidence. <br />
<br />
 CS3 = 12pts for 10% midigation and LR5 = 15pts for 5% avoidence.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Think of it this way, do you want to get hit for less or not hit at all?<br />
<br />
Not getting hit means longer survivability, meaning you can XP easier and get CS3 and ID5 quicker.<br />
<br />
GL either way and as soon as you get one of the aa chains get the other.<br />

<br />
Likewise reducing damage by around 5% is pretty close to increasing HP by 6%.<br />
<br />
So it'd appear they indeed have similar benefits.<br />
<br />
That said, never believe you're actually going to be able to notice the effect of any of the AAs.  3% more hits avoided is hardly noticeable by eyeballing.</div></div><hr />

Both AA's certainly have their advantages.  LR5 reduces proc damage by a nice margin while ID5 tends to smoothen the damage out quite a bit.  If you really think about it, it's like Evasive vs Defensive.  Both the discs reduce the same amount of damage in the long run, but Defensive tends to be a bit smoother overall.  <br />

Your choice.  It won't be long until you have both.  =)</div></div><hr />

CA/CS is 10%, CA/LR is 5%.  Other than that, it doesn't matter.  I actually altrenated between the two until both were maxed.</div></div><hr />

Everyone acts like streaks in the RNG don't exist until you get LR5.  &quot;Man, Rallos Zek missed me 5 times in a row, must be the LR5&quot;  You're full of crap.  That stuff happens all the time, you just notice it once you want to pay attention to certain things because you don't want to think you spent all that time on an AA skill that doesn't improve your performance visually.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">01-17-2004, 02:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">LR5 doesn't drop proc damage by a 'nice margin'.  It drops it by exactly the extra hits you avoided, which parses show is around 3%.  Assuming you get hit for 53% without LR5, that means proc damage is reduced by 3/53 which is a little bit more than 5%.  <br />
<br />
It's funny people can claim they actually notice proc damage going down when it's no more barely more than 5% damage reduced... and that's on procs, which is a very small portion of the damage you take even against ubers, let alone XP mobs.</div></div><hr />

No hit needed). If its an innate/contact proc (like most NPC procs are) it will need to hit to proc. Everything down to spiders have innate procs :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rysingsun1</div><div class="date">01-19-2004, 03:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">isnt it true that if you avoid hits (CA) then you get stunned less? because you cant be stunned without being hit. stuns cause loss of damage output so hits reduce your own weapon damage whereas damage doesnt. this would be an argument in favor of CA.<br />
<br />
hate to bring up the dreaded D word but my druid got CA first because he wanted to reduce &quot;stun-death&quot; which is the primary way kiters die to melee. yes its not that first hit that hurts .. its getting stunned so that everything catches up to him. well its not as important for warriors of course but stuns are stuns and they are always bad. they can lead to loss of agro or delay in getting it back. they can lead to that pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey syndrome where you where you cant get out of your own way because you dont know which way you are facing anymore. all arguments for the CA/LR route. <br />
<br />
have to admit though ... smoothing out the damage does make life easier on the healers. an argument for combat stability.<br />
<br />
of course you will get them all anyway so if you get it wrong it soon wont matter anyway.<br />
<br />
but id get both before doing the hitpoint one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">01-19-2004, 03:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes technically avoidance will decrease the times you get stunned while mitigation won't, but again this is such a minuscule part of the whole tanking picture.  You're better off getting Stalwart Endurance 3 if you're worried about stuns (actually, you should get that even if you're not worried about stuns).  <br />
<br />
If you assume you always get stunned, you never avoid a mob's kick/stun unless you have avoidance AAs, and the mob kick/bashes every 4 seconds (I don't think it's every round), then you'll get stunned 6 less times every 400 seconds, or you avoid an extra stun every 66 seconds.  Now factor in that you don't always get stunned, and that you don't always get hit to begin with, that figures out to be around 1 less stun every 4-5 minutes.  If you think you can rely on that to matter in a group then Taunt must obviously be the most reliable tool in the world too.  I certainly have never heard of anyone failing taunt for 4 minutes straight unless it's something that's not tauntable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">01-19-2004, 04:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Again, the same quote from Sscaley's parse(emphasis mine):<br />
<br />
Going from LR1 to LR5 will increase your avoidance by 3%, from 32% misses to 35% misses. Miss+Hit at LR1 is 85.6% of the swings, while Miss+Hit at LR5 is 85.8% of swings. 32% of 85.6% is 37.4% of damage avoided while 35% of 85.8% is 40.8% of damage avoided - or about a 4%-point increase in damage avoided. <br />
<br />
As I understand it(tho I am no where near as good with this stuff as Sscaley and some others), this means you will take 4 % less damage, get stunned 4 % less often, and get proced on about 4 % less often, all for 15 aa points.  This is good, and the not getting stuned and proced on is why LR should come before ID, but it still is a small amount.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">01-19-2004, 04:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Assuming LR &amp; ID has the same benefits on damage reduction then yes LR should come before ID, but LR should not come before CS, which is what a lot of people seem to be saying.  I certainly have seen plenty of people who swear by LR5 &gt; all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oogagan</div><div class="date">01-19-2004, 07:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Going from LR1 to LR5 will increase your avoidance by 3%, from 32% misses to 35% misses.<br />
<br />
I've been thinking about this, being at crossroads of having LR1 and CS2. And I had the impression that if I avoid 950+ hit, it will take mitigation of 20+ hits to get the same savings. While for warrior, getting that amount is trivial, for casters it isn't. So for druid in question LR might be better bang for the buck, while for tanking class CS is. Or did I get it totally wrong?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arathena</div><div class="date">01-19-2004, 11:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's not quite so cut and dry, Ooga. Yeah, you may avoid that extra 950 hit.. but chances are, you didn't avoid that 950 hit, you avoided that 250 hit. And the next hit you took was 600 instead of 950. Rather than being straight off the top, both AAs are adjustments to the bell-curve, shifting their peaks favorably for us. Because they're equal shifts in the peaks, they, over a time-weighted average, cause the same reduction in incoming damage. <br />
<br />
Let me try to explain it this way: <br />
A mob would have made 100 successful hits on you, for an average of 100 damage each. Thus, you take 100 x 100 = 10,000 damage.  With the 15% total of CA 3 and LR 5, he makes instead 85 sucessful attacks for an average of 100 damage each, for 85 x 100 = 8,500. With the 15 % of CS3 and ID 5, his average attack drops from 100 to 85, meaning he hits 100 x 85= 8,500 damage. 8500 = 8500, thus in the absence of the marginal effects of stuns, procs, and channeling, the two AA are equal, for any class, in terms of damage reduction. In any case, both these shift averages,  not the actual numbers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">01-19-2004, 11:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think you could make a case for casters getting LR before CA, just because most of the time if they are tanking they are trying to get a spell off or running for their lives, and an extra miss would be more useful for that than just lower damage on the hits.  <br />
<br />
For any class that's gonna go toe to toe with a mob though, it's more about reducing total DPS than whether you're getting avoidance or mitigation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomb</div><div class="date">01-21-2004, 11:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Overrated maybe, but the difference was noticable.<br />
I crunched AA in CoD (before it opened up) with my boxed cleric and it was quite noticable in the amount of mana the cleric needed to heal me (cleric was like level 57 or so back then and not grouped).<br />
When i started with run3, regen3, nd3, aetaunt, pp5, pe i needed kei on the cleric to avoid downtime.<br />
When getting ca3/lr5 i no longer needed kei and after maxing cs3/id5 i could use the cleric damage shields as well and nuke occasionally.<br />
It was in my holidays so i was on a lot between raids with only one or 2 upgrades in that time.<br />
<br />
A good answer to the original question is a quote from monkly business on the question to either get CA3/lr5 or pb3 first:<br />
'In the end you want to get both anyway, so it doesnt really matter'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">01-21-2004, 12:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When I say overrated I am just talking about LR.  There are people in my guild who will tell you there is a noticeable difference in damage taken with each level of LR.  Like &quot;I couldn't tank this mob with LR2 but now that I have LR4 I can!&quot;, which is total BS.  CA3+CS3+LR5+ID5 is around a 30% reduction in dps taken though, and that is definitely a noticeable difference, especially if you heal yourself with a cleric bot like you and I do.    There is no doubt that you are a whole lot tougher with those AAs than without em, as you should be for 50 points worth of AA hehe.</div></div><hr />
