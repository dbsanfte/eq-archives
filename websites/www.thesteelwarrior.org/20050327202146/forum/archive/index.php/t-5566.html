<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gront</div><div class="date">02-06-2004, 07:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've got a 65 warrior 1360/6100 with CA1/CS1 for tanking and DPS.  I've got a 65 beastlord for slows (50%), haste, and DPS.  And I've got a 59 druid who comes along to pop CHeals on the warrior every now and again.<br />
<br />
I'm looking for suggestions on places I can triple-box for good XP, with an eye to improving my warrior's and beastlord's AA's.  Criteria: (1) single pulls should be achievable without pacify, (2) druid CHeal should be able to keep up with the damage of a slowed mob, and (3) XP-per-hour should please be better than Akheva, which is really getting boring to me right about now.<br />
<br />
Help?<br />
<br />
Thanks much,<br />

Harmony the frogs on/around the rocks and once its broken you can go for a while.  It does get boring though.  I currently 4-box there and will be moving to HOH basements for something new.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">faederya</div><div class="date">02-06-2004, 12:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Droga is nice also.  Several places with no roamers and rather easy to single pull.  Mobs drop coin also and there dmg output is nil, barley even need to slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">radalas</div><div class="date">02-06-2004, 02:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dok-B is a good place also.  Decent loot with the ring quest and also chance for a ft2 necklace.<br />
<br />
The trick is to figure out a way to get there, and without a cleric it maybe a pain to CR if you do wipe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zynth</div><div class="date">02-06-2004, 04:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">my brother and myself use a similar set up for 3 boxing, only we use a cleric instead of a druid and all 3 are 65. we started out in PoV working on larva and frogs and as my hp and defensive AAs got better we moved up to harder stuff. we can do just about any camp outside of PoP easily. and probably up to sol ro tower, we havent tried yet since the cleric isnt flagged for sol ro yet. the only limiting factors is how much damage you can take before a slow lands and how long it takes your Bst to land the slow since they dont have a resist debuff to cast before they cast slow. once the mobs are slowed, the bst can tank them if need be.<br />
the bst can get you similar HP to what a shammy would give you, but using up more buff slots. the onyl problem i see is that the druid wouldnt supply you with as much raw hp as a cleric can, alot, you will get the extra use of things like snare and damage shield. most of the time the cleric doesnt do much aside from buffs, CH, hammer pet clicky on ornate legs, and spot heal the bst if the mobs resist slows too much. in BoT, the cleric is almost always full just from self buffs, spiritual dominion and sitting on a mount. the exp is decent, but no where near as good in a full group. ogres in tactics actaully give better exp per kill, but they are harder, mitigate and resist slow more often, hit a little harder on adverage and occasionally try to run at low health.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Please elaborate.<br />
<br />
Thanks!  <br />
<br />
Also, thanks all who have answered so far.  I'll try out at least the frogs and Droga, and post my AAXP/hour for your delectation.<br />
<br />
Take care,<br />

<br />
The zone is perceived to be hard to get to without decent Chardok faction, despite the fact that someone who knows the way and has a sow and a brain can run down there taking minimal damage.  Therefore, it's usually uncamped except for the occasional farmer.<br />
<br />
Xp is moderate to poor there - Droga is better.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ring quest&quot; - quest for a WIS caster ring which might go well on your druid.  Involves farming four pages (which most classes can solo at 65) then a final boss encounter which is easily completed with a single group.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ft2 necklace&quot; - Spiritmaster War Beads, a tradeable necklace with 25hp, 25mana and Flowing Thought II, recommended level 55.  Obtained by camping in any area where Ferocious Chokidai spawn.  In these areas A Rabid Chokidai is a rare spawn, and its rare drop is the necklace.  Your group could easily take the Rabid Chokidai; I've soloed that critter with a 65 cleric.<br />
<br />
Areas where a Vicious Chokidai spawn (e.g. the entrance) also have a chance of spawning a Rabid Chokidai.  However, Rabid Chokidai in these areas only drop earrings.<br />
<br />
The only reason most people go to Chardok B is to farm Spiritmaster War Beads; on my server people ask 150k in the Bazaar for them.</div></div><hr />

Not sure if your 59th druid could zone in though, but I used to duo / trio them alot with my warrior a shaman and sometimes a monk.</div></div><hr />

Exp off the DEs around the Cathedral.  Then, when you're all 65 and have some AA under your belt, move onto the DEs around Inny.  Everyone one of those guys can be singled as you can practically walk up to their faces and they won't agro.  The exp is very good and you can wrack up a lot of cash given time as they all drop ~20pp a kill and the occassional gem.</div></div><hr />
