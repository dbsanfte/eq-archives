<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sturgis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Guild went up and tooled around in Hate today. Got to the church and started clearing it, killed the Hand of Maestro for one of our other warriors. Then we figured we'd try Superman himself. We're hardly a big guild, most of us have at least one 50+ character and several us of have 60+ or multiples. We had I think 15 people (probably average level around 59 or so) and I was the main tank. Havent paid much attention to spoiler sites so didnt really know how much they beefed up Maestro.<br />

That's me - blissful in my ignorance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">rofl.<br />
<br />
how many seconds before everyone died?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sturgis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Oh, I dont know. I got pummelled for 800+, 700+, 500+, 600+ proc for 1500, 250, 250, 1030. Dead. I think the rest of them were dead before I finished zoning to bind point. :D<br />
<br />
But, on the bright side, I finally saw my Mirror I augment fire off for the first time. Bounced a 700 point DD back at one of the champions of hate up there. And, I just picked up a 16/26 1h blunt with Guard II proc in a dungeon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wizards with Spellshield are one key to keeping your tanks alive.<br />
<br />
4 cleric rotation helps too.<br />
<br />
Good off-tanks are great to have for the adds that spawn.<br />
<br />
Overall higher DPS helps tremendously, as long as you have control of it. It's important that once he gets to 30% you kill him quick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Terrorus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">His life tap proc is too unpredictable, we eventually had to go do a 3 sec rotation with 6 clerics if I recall correctly.  Kill the hands and offtank the banshees.  We started the fight near the door, then after killing the hands we moved maestro up near the piano so cleric would not take the 1st AE from the Banshees.  Its a fun fight overall...  I believe we had about 30-40peeps attend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kendolekk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The rotation really depends on if you have a spellshield rotation going also. The spellshield rotation eliminates the lifetap proc, and Maestro's melee is rough, although completely manageable.<br />
<br />
The fight really boils down to complete strategy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Draganetti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'd strongly recommend 500 MR on your tank as opposed to using spell shield.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I had 500MR and was still getting hit by it, although not for full damage.  Didnt bother too much with spellshield, had it initially...prettty sure that was the only time i saw it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Draganetti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well, spell shield absorbs 700 damage.  500MR probably means you take a quasi-average of half damage from the procs. . .so it's the same difference.  If you want to spend alot of peridots, be my guest, but I'd imagine your healers would like something to do and your nukers would prefer to nuke.  My guild uses spell shield often for certain fights, but we never did for maestro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Maestro is a real badass.  Our MT fell once and I immedietly picked up the slack, as I was supposed to, but the clerics couldn't transfer to me fast enough.  I was dead within seconds.  His melee can be downright ridiculous especially with his proc.<br />
<br />
Kill those hands at 75%, otherwise you'll never get passed Maestro's &quot;new&quot; regen.  At 30-40%, the banshees come alive and that's when the raid tends to fall apart.  One of them AE manadrains, one of them charms, and one of them sings a fire resist song for Maestro.  Root them to keep them in place and offtank them, focus on finishing Maestro.  He actually doesn't have that many hp at all.  <br />
<br />
Lastlyl, our MT mentioned his proc isn't a lifetap.  In our developing stage for this guy, we had our raid go out and try to finish off the banshees.  Despite being proc'd on many multiple times, Maestro's health never went up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Halivon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Just to add that the hands are easly tanked by 2 paladins chain stuning (who i was told never gets resisted), very easy, no healers needed even, just put 3 dps peeps on one and then on the other but make sure you kill them before the 30/40%. <br />
<br />
Then one necro feed the palies mana back and have them stun tank the 2 nasty adds at the end(drain and charm), the one remaining can be tanked and rooted where it pops and won't do anything to the fight.<br />
<br />
Kill Maestro and kill the 3 adds and its done.<br />
<br />
Not hard once you done it and get a strat, and it acctually gives the palies something to do other to complain about everything.<br />
(JUST KIDDING)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Zynth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">i heard some where that maestro was undead, assuming this is correct, wouldnt it also be correct to assume that an undead slow might work on him, or would it not make it past his ungodly resists? also, wounldnt evasive be smarter than using defensive?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Draganetti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I think for most people that &quot;need&quot; to use a disc on maestro should use defensive.  It will smoothe out the damage better than evasive.  Probably either would work fine though.  The main thing is having 500MR on your MT and knowing how to deal with the adds.  I understand that some people just zerg maestro down quite successfully when the banshees spawn.  We deal with them before finishing maestro off.  I don't recommend killing all three of them, though.<br />
<br />
I'd say the three main issues with maestro are usually 1) how to deal with the adds, 2) not having 500MR on tank, 3) realizing that maestro is undead, and proximity is hugely important for his aggro.</div></div><hr />

<br />
IT's certainly a lifetap.  <br />
<br />
When you resist it completely you will see it.  Also remember that maestro has to hit you to proc, so using evasive my be more of a benefit.  He really doesnt hit all that hard, but he does seem to reposte a lot.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Dima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Bust in Evasive and get some MR, kill the adds as they regenerate maestro at a strong rate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Only the hands regen Maestro. When doing him with small numbers, just count on him getting back to 100% while you kill the hands. The banshees pop later in the fight and do not cause any additional regen.</div></div><hr />
