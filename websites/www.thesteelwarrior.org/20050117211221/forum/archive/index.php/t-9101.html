I hadn't anticipated the complete pita it would be because of the hate/fear revamps over the last 4 years.  Here's where I'm at:<br />
<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1114788<br />
<br />
I know I'm off, I did the best that I could with what I had to work with.  I started playing in September of 2000: I wasn't even arround back then.  So, any suggestions/comments about better gear from this time period?</div></div><hr />

WTF is &quot;Dagas&quot;?  I started playing in summer of '99 and I never heard of that.  Spined Dragon Claws would be a better choice for an uber warrior in that timeframe.<br />
<br />
Also, the earrings, mask, belt and shoudler item look suspect.  Are you sure these are from pre-kunark?  My guess is no.  For rings no warrior at that tiem would not be wearing Djarn's.  Go with platinum fire wedding rings, if he was smart.  Platinum black pearl if he was stupid (you wouldn't believe how many people thought those +7 dex/agi rings were great).</div></div><hr />

And I am sure there are items with good AC slots.<br />
<br />
Tells you something about mudflation though, when I now give out a rule of thumb of 20 x level for AC.</div></div><hr />

I believe it's the 1-hander quested in PoSky.  There was also a 2-handed axe which was equally good.  Although technically it was available prior to Kunark, in practical terms it was unobtainable in that era.  PoSky azarack island was considered unbeatable before Kunark, and people could only reach the later islands by exploiting with levitation.  Levitation was nerfed soon enough, and thereafter the zone went unused except for Noble Dojorn zergfests, until the epic quests were introduced about 6 months later and gave people new reasons to go there.  Also, the quest items dropped about 1/3 as frequently then as they do today, so most of those quests went unfinished until Velious era.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, everyone I knew back in the day wore enchanter crafted 35hp earrings or Diamondines.</div></div><hr />

Not a bad base... though I was not nearly as uber back then. <br />
<br />
I do wish Magelo had a historical mode...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I thought jewel-crafting was revamped around Velious and the best items that could be crafted were + 5 kinda items, not +90 hp's, etc.  Will need the name of the rings and the slot they need to be replaced from please =).</div></div><hr />

You'll want those instead of what you have listed. Ivandyr's Hoop might be a good option for one spot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">09-25-2004, 04:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Renion is correct that jewelcraft was revamped sometime around Kunark's release.  Prior to that revamp, there was no such thing as 5/55 rings or 2/35 earrings.  The 3AC 8Dis earrings were the best tank earrings that a player could make.<br />
<br />
Although the Belt of 4 Winds PoSky quest was not solvable before Kunark, the random poSky loot Belt of Contention would have been owned by many uber warriors before Kunark.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Charnondall</div><div class="date">09-25-2004, 04:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Most ubers back then had the Cloak of Flames and a RBB just to be flashy, the cool thing about back before kunark was that hp etc didnt really matter, it was more or less the uniqueness of the items you gained that made them great. Like full indo was the mac daddy and the bloodfire was amazing cause of its rareness, its look and the sheer ammount of effort and people needed to aquire it.<br />
<br />
Cant remember what the uber earrings or rings were back then but they were probably ones that were rare to obtain, in stead of ones that had actual good stats.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You know what, you're right.<br />
<br />
I do vaguely remember getting a 3ac 8 dis earring made for Haass at some point...uhh, golden topaz or some such.<br />
<br />
And since that was the best earring craftable, then I can guarantee you that the majority of high end tanks were wearing Diamondine now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
and yeah haass; you were part right. if you were an uber you wore diamondines along with the EBW's you made from Butler/Maid fangs....than of course your Exe Axe :D</div></div><hr />

Think that speaks for itself why he had a Dagas :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Weapons were bloodfire, SSoY (2x if you could), EBW or Exec Axe/Mith Sword<br />
<br />
Waist was FBSS, RBB or TBB<br />
<br />
Indy armor (being all potato was the mark of uberness)<br />
<br />
Shoulders were crested spaulders?<br />
<br />
Earrings as above...the ones from MM (diadine?)<br />
<br />
mask/neck...one of these was from Sol a elemental guy (name/item eludes me)<br />
<br />
range..wow kerran toy?<br />
<br />
Back was CoF<br />
<br />
I'm embarrrased i cant remember more.<br />
<br />
I do remember a guy named Fitty was the most uber of ubers back then...he was level 50 and geared when everyone else on stratics board was level 35.</div></div><hr />

I used to have a Darkwar Mask long ago, and it dropped randomly off the mobs on the 2nd floor of Hate.  This was after Hate's first revamp in the Velious era, the addition of mobs up there that dropped paladin, ranger, and druid Plane of Growth equivalent armors.<br />
<br />
That's where I got mine anyway.  No idea if it used to be an old old world item as well or not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Shaped Darkwood Compound Bow.  That was the shit back in the day.<br />
<br />
If you weren't a warrior...SPLITPAW EYE! +2 sv poison!<br />
<br />
Remember that the Idol of the Thorned was so valuable for so long because most people didn't have shit in their range slots.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Diamondines were the best available with the 3AC ones the only other real option until the JC upgrade.<br />
<br />
The name of the neck item from SoL B escapes me...Mithril Choker or somesuch, I know that isnt it.<br />
<br />
Crested Spaulders were nice.<br />
<br />
Always liked EBW better than Yaks.  Though, the Yak procs were badass, at the time.  Exe Axe was nice too.<br />
<br />
Kerran Toy wasnt in the game until around Kunark I dont think.  When they revamped it, wasnt it?  Shaped Darkwood was where it was at.<br />
<br />
TBB with CoF was High end.<br />
<br />
Jagged Bands!  LMAO, that brings back memories.<br />
<br />
For the life of me I cant remember anymore.  I started in Jul 99 and that was too long ago.  Thanks for the walk down memory lane.  EC was my home for a lot of hours hehehehee.<br />

/auction WTT GEB for FBSS!<br />

Old Innoruuk Loot is spread out over the first teir hate minis such as Magi P'tasa, Grandmaster R'tal, Lord of Loathing, etc. All I can really remember from his drop table was Bloodmoon and Beckon, and the warriors don't care about that. :p<br />
<br />
The neck from the fire giants in Sol B was the Polished Mithril Torque.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not sure the quest started on that cat island by Erudin and you killed a clockwork in Steamfont but i dont remember when that became a big deal...maybe they added it after Kunark.<br />
<br />
I loved that bow though (compound darkwood)...I remember how excited I was when I got mine.<br />
<br />
Lava runed pendant I think was neck from Sol A.  The dented brass mask rocked as previous poster mentioned (totally forgot the damn camp I put into this..oh the pain)</div></div><hr />

<br />
How could we forget the Thick Banded Belt? LOL.  But the Belt of Contention would have been a more common uber belt in January-April prior to Kunark - for those who didn't have an RBB at least.<br />
<br />
The most uber of warriors would have had a Box of Abu-Kar, and one each of the dragons' weight reducing bags.<br />
<br />
The manastone in the original proposed magelo is a nice touch. :)  Should add a Guise of the Deceiver, as any warrior worth his salt would have had one of those.  Insta-click Egg-Shaped Pumice was standard equipment in those days, too.</div></div><hr />

Box of Abu'Kar was definately awesome.  Still got mine, heheheheheee.<br />
<br />
Still have my Kerran Toy...found it in the bank last night.  I can remember everyone running around trying to do this quest as it was some extra free AC!  Easy to do too.<br />
<br />
Dented Brass Mask was a hella camp, dropped more bags then you could shake a stick at, before I got my mask.</div></div><hr />

First Dagas I ever saw was on Furor back when kunark was released.<br />
<br />
Bloodfire, and the GM claw were the top of the line.<br />
<br />
Also, Butcherblock Hammer, that Kreugan used to solo the ghoul lord with, mighty uber back then, only one per server, after kunark, GM item kinda disapeared to be replaced by the uber stuff.<br />
<br />
As far as I can recall, it all started with stats are king, then AC is king, then HP is king, then AC and hp, then AC/hp/resist, to this day when you see AC/hp/resist/shielding/etc...<br />
<br />
Remember when kunark got out, and lamentations were 25kpp? People showing up in guk with sword of the sky, horrible 11/22 sword with an aoe that broke mez :P.<br />

Lol. I still have mine and I was going to give it to a new player I'd met recently, but I had to log off before I could find the damn thing (hmm...which mule was that on?). I'll find her again next time I'm on and hand it over fast before she gets something better.<br />

By the way, that shoulder piece, Shawl of Protection, didn't exist until the Plane of Fear revamp where they upgraded the Dracholiche.<br />
That was what ... Velius era ?<br />
They changed CT to have a bunch more hitpoints and hit much harder than the pesky 425 Dam he originally hit for.<br />
