<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AdylonECI</div><div class="date">06-12-2003, 08:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, after taking some advice, my wife (51 druid) and I (51 warrior) went to Dulaks harbor to take on some of the boats.  I've read posts about mages at level 49 being able to keep the boat clear and keep them busy.<br />
<br />
My wife and I however can only kill about 7 of the 10-11 spawns before they start repoping.  The problem isn't mana (she has KEI on usually) it's that I just can't kill them fast enough.  If she does go the heavy nuking rate, then she gets low on mana. Now up to this point I have been 1hs and am about to skill up my 2hs so hopefully that will make it faster.  I always have thorns and chloro on me and my wife throws out a nuke every now and then and heals of course.<br />
<br />
Any tips to speed up killing? Will going 2HS make the speed difference I'm looking for with increased DPS?  I think my wife could level faster quadding!  So are mages overpowered solo machines or are we doing something wrong?<br />
<br />

Thanks for any tips or advice:</div></div><hr />

your best bet really is try the 2Her. also how much damage you taking? might want to invest in a trunch of doom to cut down the damage you take.<br />
slap on some damage shields and hope for the best. usually though i found out that 1Hers around that level seem to put out a bit more damage.<br />
when i used to duo with my wife's druid we were doing okay ( i used JBoW and ToD for slows; level 61..she was level 58+full spellbook ) .. although she could quad circles around me if she was solo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raunstonecutter</div><div class="date">06-12-2003, 09:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The 2h should do better, though that depends on what 1hers you were using.  Better haste never hurts.  See if you can get VoG from a chanter before going, it last like an hour.  Any kind of aditional DS would help too</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">06-12-2003, 09:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You're only hasted 21% when you're duoing with a druid.  Mage pets are hasted FAR more with a better DS.  you're not gonna be able to compete damage output from a mage pet, that's not your job.<br />
<br />
You're at a disadvantage from the get go, and you're also worried about comparing apples to oranges.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AdylonECI</div><div class="date">06-12-2003, 09:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It just seems that two characters should be able to fight more mobs than a person does solo.  I'll keep up the work with my 2hs and see how it improves. <br />
<br />
Maybe a ranger would have been a better combo with the druid =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">06-12-2003, 10:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You said it yourself that your druid can't really overnuke or she goes OOM.  So it's not really 2 characters trying to outpace one, you're trying to outpace a mage with C3 and a pet that quads for 55 with a 25 point damage shield who's hasted 60% with a warrior who's hasted 21% and got some druids buffs.  See the difference?<br />
<br />
The difference is that you're not putting out anywhere near the amount of damage a mage your level does, nor should you.  Your druid isn't contributing enough to make up the difference, so you're going to kill slower.<br />
<br />
Just be happy you have a real life person to talk to while you're doing it...the mage has to talk to that damned blob and it tends to make most of them crazy (seriously, all the mages i've met are just whacked)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AdylonECI</div><div class="date">06-13-2003, 08:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess I do have a human to talk to that would be a little better than a little blob =).  Thanks for the replies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jaxxym</div><div class="date">06-13-2003, 09:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you are looking to add to your DPS significantly, I think you'll be disappointed with moving to a 2 hander - you may get a boost but I doubt it would be all that noticable: if you're taking down 7 of 10 mobs with a 1 hander, the a 2 hander might get you 8 of 10 - if yer lucky.<br />
<br />
A more effective approach might be to obtain some Kilva's potions - get the higher dmg one. Thats 30+ dmg per hit and unless yer weilding ToD, sounds like yer facing unslowed mobs. That will make a very noticable difference for you I think.<br />
<br />
Those potions are expensive, so if that's an issue see if you can provide components to a shammy for combine or level one up in alchemy to make em yerself (though this is extremely expensive itself, not to mention tedious as hell). Potion stacks with most DS except for ranga DS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">06-13-2003, 09:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">kilvas may be a bit too expensive really for normal grinding. cant remeber how much they cost on my server but iirc they are about 200 pp or more. however they should last for 2 mobs maybe 3 so if the mobs are giving you decent cash loot then it may be worth it, although basicallyall that cash loot will then be ploughed back into potions.<br />
<br />
getting 1 or 2 more levels will help. also, you said your wife was throwing nukes. she shouldnt be nuking. given that your 1 on 1 with a mob, fights should be lasting sufficently long for her to dot -and dots are more dmg /mana efficient than druid nukes. also, check whether she has the druid clicky dot elder spiritist item - cant remeber which slot that was. it pretty cheap and thats a couple of hundred extra damage. so just get her to stack her nice dots on the mob.<br />
<br />
if possible, make sure you wife has the best possible mana regen stacking - Kei, PoTG and beastcrack. not sure if she has a horse but that can help too. she should bind in the zone and can just gate to nexus to pick up these buffs when she runs out if necessary.<br />
<br />
as for yourself, make sure you have every single buff possible. you said you had chloro and DS, but do you get wolfform as well? that gives you added atk.  aslo, make sure you bug any buffing classes in the zone for whatever buffs they can give you.<br />
<br />
haste will also increase your DPS a lot. make sure you get what you can, even if its only a crappy low level haste.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Braeorn</div><div class="date">06-13-2003, 10:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Using a ToD or willsapper to slow em first will make a big difference, provided you get yer 2H up enough for it to proc (read: you need to hit the mob). Yer druid will have to use less mana for heals, thus having more for nukes. I'm guessing the reduced DS dmg will be more than compensated by the nukes.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure at 51 if yer dps will go up with 2h or not, but I know that 60+ it makes a significant difference. You also get less ripostes though I'm not sure if Dulak mobs rip that much. Again, less ripostes = less dmg take = less mana to heal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neksnappa</div><div class="date">06-13-2003, 11:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">At 51, switching to a 1:1 ratio 2hs will make a big difference in dps. I mean, at 49, my frosty/barnacle axe have a slightly lower than a 75pp weighty polearm (28/34 at my level). When I was using a reaver, my DPS jumped by 10-15% while grinding. <br />
<br />
And, as stated above, you'll never come near a mage dps without the druid chain-nuking, but there are a few things she can do to narrow the gap.<br />
<br />
Elder spiritist's vambraces- clicky level 34 DOT spell, it's mana free, but has an 8 second cast time on it. If she casts this at the beginning of the fight, then throws on the level 44 DOT and immolate, she's doing a decent amount of damage. <br />
<br />
Starfire, the best 49 druid nuke, is pretty mana-efficient, and a few of those makes a nice difference. <br />
<br />
Another way to save mana so she can cast more dots/nukes would be to get a mana preservation 2 item, and use the 16pt dmg shield, rather than the 24 pt one. At level 51, her newest damage shield doesn't last very long, and those things are mana hogs.<br />
<br />
Last thing- be sure she keeps a strength buff on you. Strength = more atk = slightly more dps. every little bit helps.</div></div><hr />

I contend that both could be correct so it could an and/or type proposition.  Or it could be a neither proposition which I believe this one is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">QuirtEvans</div><div class="date">06-14-2003, 09:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I suppose it's a little late to suggest she should have started a shammy, huh?  You lose the damage shield but you get haste, and slow, and the pet ... and with some plat, the mana free DD bracer, which speeds things up substantially.  <br />
<br />
I don't think you're doing anything wrong.  You're not a DPS class, really, to keep the boat fully cleared you need more DPS.  The good news, though, is that you don't need to keep the boat fully cleared.  If you're there for the loot, like the charm or the plate pants, the captain is the guy you want, and he always spawns in the same spot.  If you keep the deck he's on cleared, you don't have to worry about the few mobs that spawn on the other deck, they are too far away to aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kragrock</div><div class="date">06-16-2003, 02:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I also duo'd the boats from 51 with a druid, stuck to Dirulia as you didnt get adds.   Fastest way I found was use 2hs, Buff up with SoW, Skin, Str, Chloro and DS. didnt slow just pulled and killed. heal when needed and keep the DS up.  Was able to almost clear the boat.<br />
<br />
Krag</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">daoga</div><div class="date">06-16-2003, 02:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">suggestion, on your wifes spell lineup, add fixation of ro in there, atk and ac debuff, when my wife (52 paladin) and i duo with my 52 druid, we have found that fixation of ro makes a noticeable difference as to how fast the mobs go down and how much damage she takes.... just my 2cp's worth.</div></div><hr />
