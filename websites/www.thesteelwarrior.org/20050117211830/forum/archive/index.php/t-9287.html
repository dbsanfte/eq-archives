now outside of a CHOS and some other assorted crap these are by far the two best weapons I have (I have about the worlds worst luck rolling for raid weapons).  Anyway I am curious if there is any obvious edge to using one vs the other in Primary or secondary hand?  I see the efficiency and offhand etc is the same.  The SoMV has a slightly better proc...but honestly I can't gauge a huge agro difference or dps difference either way.  <br />
<br />
And sitting in the bazaar there are some decent sales on the Mace of Memories (if I don't get to loot one first)....do we know how it's proc and offhand value compares for DPS and agro value?<br />
<br />
Currently I figure it is probably a wash but I hate to think I'm missing something substantial.</div></div><hr />

I would personally mainhand the SoMV, but only because it's proc does a little more damage and decreases AC a little bit more. <br />
<br />
Offhanding a MoM would probably lower your DPS a little bit, but it might increase aggro. I don't know how much value a AC debuff is getting assigned, but I doubt that it's more than a stun.</div></div><hr />

They don't have to glow or sparkle or anything, but at least make them pretty and cool to look at. More stuff like a Jagged Shard of Frozen Flame, Great Blade of Storms, hell even the Ethereal Destroyer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grayhelm</div><div class="date">10-07-2004, 11:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know there's been loads of talk about stun/hate aggro, do we have any numbers / figures / analysis of how much hate a 15 ac or 9 ac debuff might be?<br />
<br />
Based purely on the theory that flame lick is huge aggro with a very small ac debuff (3?), it's possible the proc might be nice hate, but it's also possible the flame lick hate could be from the level difference (as per the ykesha argument), and since these procs aren't spells, we don't know if that 'level' difference exists?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gimmel</div><div class="date">10-07-2004, 12:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No one has stated that aggro has anything to do with a level difference of the spell. I'm not sure where you are getting that from. Merely that for certain types of spells, aggro scales up with mob level (e.g. Casting stun on a level 5 creature generates less hate than on a level 70 creature).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">10-07-2004, 01:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">assuming the procs are = aggro i'd mainhand the 14/18 as it produces ever-so-slightly more dps and dps aggro.  The difference is so small it's practically non-existant. Use what ya like.</div></div><hr />

Hmm, my post was badly worded.<br />
<br />
My question still stands, any investigation into how much hate AC debuff procs are?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sam DeathWalker</div><div class="date">10-08-2004, 12:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another question would be how do these items compare to OSoW (procrate is 2.25ppm) or BoC?<br />
<br />
Would you use these new weapons over eaither of those if hate is yur main concern and dps is secondary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">10-08-2004, 12:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OSoW with it's proc-rate mod would be better i'm pretty sure ... that and the OSoW isnt buyable so it's a higher status symbol than something anyone with &quot;x&quot; amt of play can just buy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shredder</div><div class="date">10-08-2004, 05:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">that and the OSoW isnt buyable so it's a higher status symbol than something anyone with &quot;x&quot; amt of play can just buy. <br />
<br />
I've never seen the OSoW that way.  When we blazed through PoP, 1 warrior grabbed one.  It actually was a status symbol for him at the time since it was the first one on the server and people wanted to know what that fugly looking pigsticker was.  The rest either went to rangers, or rotted.  He's a 1 group deal now, same as the SoMV camp.<br />
<br />
<br />
The AC debuff on the SoMV is almost 3 times as much as the OSoW, so despite the 125% proc rate on the OSoW, I'm curious how that plays into the equation.<br />
<br />
Statwise, they're close enough to be marginal aside from more HP and END on the SoMW.<br />
<br />
The burning question for me is; the aggro difference between the two.  Proc for proc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm willing to bet it's marginal at best, since Stuns produce excellent aggro no matter the DD component.  It's not like the lowest level Tash produces less aggro than Howl of Tashan....similar stuff goes on.<br />
<br />
I'd be really surprised if the amount of AC played any significant factor in the aggro process.</div></div><hr />

I'm assuming the BBC mob is easier.  How hard do they hit?  HP's?  Do they mitigate slow?  The group I usually play with regularly takes down BoT mini bosses in BoT like Oreen, Hreidar, etc.  I am assuming these guys are harder, are they much harder?  Are they more like tower bosses?<br />
<br />
Figures they were rushing the expansion out so fast they wouldn't put updated graphics on the swords.  Pretty sad.  They have a nice updated graphic on the chillsteeper which is a good aggro weapon, but not on the high end weapons.  Yeesh.</div></div><hr />
