<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>WarGovno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am close to having 760 points in Deepest Guk to buy  Slimestone Fragment of Dread, Proc: Force of Ykesha, i dont like LDoN and dont want to come back any time soon to save up points again so my question is would be better to put the proc on GSoT, or buy Windblade or WMBS and put the proc on one of those? I am thinking GSoT to get the double proc but some advice would help. =) thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Roughbeard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Double Proc &gt; Single Proc no doubt, the difference in ratios wont make up for the missing proc, so GSoT Double is the way to go :)<br />
<br />
Rough</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bonequest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Definitely put it on the GSoT.  Alone GSoT is good agro and with a Ykesha proc it might possibly out taunt a BoW.  My friend has a BoW and I have GSoT and sometimes I take his agro with it if I get a series of procs all in a row so its pretty good to start with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gunrack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hell yes, I am personally going to put double on GSoT, one in Truncheon of Doom (I partner with a cleric in our guild a lot and we need the slow) and will put it on the damned copper hammer and bloodsworn too!  the DPS weapons I will augment to do more DPS with (hopefully) zero agro or defensive stuff like guards/spellshields etc..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Caution: the mods are lore (although there is a work around to get around this).  I'd strongly advise you plan where we you are going to allocate the 2 stun mods (500/760) ahead of time.  My plan is to put the lesser on my 2 handed agro option (GSoT as I have no access to the greater weapons) and 1 the 760 on a 1 hander (TBD which).<br />
<br />
To answer the original posters question depends on what their goal is.  Is it:<br />
<br />
1. Obtain the best agro?<br />
(or)<br />
2. Have decent agro on a &quot;big gun&quot; 2 hander?<br />
<br />
If 1 go with 2x GSoT, if 2 go with a stun mod on windblade, TSBS or other large 2 hander.<br />
<br />
Opinion: the whole idea of lore on weapon mods is preposterous.  If a player wants to spend 5-6k modding all their weapons thats not unbalancing...its personal decision.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Baldarou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I was under the impression that LORE tag only applies when you hold the augment or within each weapon. You could put a 125dd stun yeksha proc in as many weapons you like that has a slot 4.  You cant put the two of the same augment in an item though, like two 40hp coals in a BP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">nope lore is lore. it was a rumor</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Mok<br />
<br />
Heh so which interpretation is correct?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gunrack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Aye, I'd like to know this cause I was under the impression that the lore tag was only for the augment in its item form.. not while augmenting a weapon... I do understand that while augmenting the weapon however you cannot put the same augmentation in that specific item.. didn't know you couldn't on different items tho<br />
<br />
Anyone have the answer to this, or was it given on another post already?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Meyni</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">As of right now, you can't have more than one Force of Ykesha  augmented weapon at the same time.   Unfortunately, the vendor will let you purchase a 2nd one and augment it on a 2nd weapon, but if you die, you will get duplicate lore item when you try to loot them.  I found this out the hard way, because I also interpreted lore to mean the augment itself, prior to bonding.<br />
<br />
I heard this was being discussed somewhere else on these boards, but can't seem to find the topic :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Leelron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Does this restriction on Augments only apply to weapons and not Armor ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">You cannot have more than 1 LORE augment.  <br />
(treat like lore items, exept its lore augments)<br />
<br />
You cannot put 2 times the same augment on 1 item. <br />
(stupid but true)<br />
<br />
TypeX = require a Type X slot to be put in.<br />
(armor restriction (arms/ear/gloves/etc/etc) still applies)<br />
<br />
Note that Type1 augments dont exist (2 3 4 5 8 do exist).<br />
Thus you will have to put those nifty  TypeALL augments<br />
in Type1 slots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Sorry for the slight thread de-rail...<br />
<br />
You cannot have more than 1 LORE augment.  <br />
<br />
As stated (correctly/incorrectly?) above it appears you can PURCHASE more than 1 lore augment.  <br />
<br />
It also sounds like you can also APPLY more than 1 &quot;lore&quot; aug to different weapons.  <br />
<br />
It was also stated in another thread (correctly/incorrectly?) that you can avoid the &quot;loot lore&quot; check by bagging the weapon with the duplicate lore aug on it. <br />
<br />
I'm assuming these are facts because I can't imagine anyone making this scenario up.<br />
<br />
You cannot put 2 times the same augment on 1 item.  <br />
<br />
I've seen screen shots of the +40hp aug put on a BP 3x...not certain this is statement is valid.  <br />
<br />
I think I've learned enough from this thread that the lore aug thing is broken.  To be honest I think I'm grateful if its broken the way I *think* it has been broken ;-)<br />
<br />
What I'm really curious about though:<br />
<br />
The veng 3 (type 3) aug are marked lore...with the logic above:<br />
<br />
1. Buy-one and apply one (say to a pair of boots with a type 3 aug spot)<br />
2. Buy a second (defying the laws of lore) and apply it to another piece of gear (say to sleeves with a type 3 aug spot)<br />
3. Run into the same &quot;dupe lore aug&quot; when looting?  You'd need to loot the boots...bag them then loot the sleeves?  /boggle  <br />
<br />
Wouldn't it would seem RIDICULOUS that for all your armor slot type 3s (I dunno approx. 14 slots) that you could only buy and apply one veng 3 aug without a complex corpse loot?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sivok Kovis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I think he ment 2x on lore not on all augs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">First<br />
<br />
You can not put 2 times the same augment on 1 item.<br />
(Even if that augment is not lore)<br />
<br />
You didnt see 3x40hp caus its impossible. <br />
What you saw was  40 (Takish) 40 (rujarkan) 30 (guk)<br />
<br />
http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/attachment.php?s=&amp;postid=43323<br />
<br />
Is proof enough, if it was possible to do 40hp repeats it would had been done.<br />
Notice 40+40+30 , and the 2 40hp done have the same name.<br />
<br />
Secondly<br />
<br />
You can &amp; can not have 2 lore augments. (Dunno if it got fixed).<br />
A friend put the DD75 cold 100point for Miragul on his BoC.<br />
Worked perfectly.<br />
<br />
He then decided to ad DD75 cold on his earth hammer too.<br />
He bought it, augmented it.<br />
Worked perfectly<br />
<br />
Then in a raid he dies ..... Tries to loot .... Guess what ?<br />
Couldnt loot the hammer (Lore Item detected)<br />
He had to un-augment the BoC to loot the hammer.<br />
<br />
I assume this was a bug, and got fixed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">&quot;nope lore is lore. it was a rumor&quot;<br />
<br />
Nah, it's not a rumor.<br />
<br />
I have 2 coldstone procs (20 AP dinky proc from Guk). One on my shissar bane weapon. One on my spiked velium mallet.<br />
<br />
I can equip them easily.<br />
<br />
When I die, I put one in my bag after I loot it, and loot the next one.<br />
<br />
It's easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">deleted</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Nimraukatur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Just a thought...<br />
<br />
Could it be that the lore message only occurs when identical augments have been added to otherwise identical items, such as *shrug* two SSoY's. It seems that if you take two lore identical augments you can put them on DIFFERENT items, without any lore message interference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Bonequest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I have a warm emerald shard (40 points from Tak) on my GBoS until I can get better.  I bought a copper hammer tonight and was going to put one on it too but the vendor wouldn't let me buy it.  The aug is marked lore so I guess they don't want people to duplicate them.  Its quite stupid why they would do this.  If I want to earn 760 points multiple times and put force of ykesha on every weapon I got, I see no game breaking reason why I shouldn't be able to.</div></div><hr />
