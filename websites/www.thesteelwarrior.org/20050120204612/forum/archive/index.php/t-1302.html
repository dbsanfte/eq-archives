We create a raid, invite next goup and they go to group 7 when only 2 groups in raid.  As soon as group 12 is filled after about 6 groups you cant invite any more people to the Raid.  So for now max raid is set to about 36 people before it gets full.  Also channels are broken, they work for about an hour then...nothing 5 hours later they work again for about another hour.  They need to fix this crap its gettnig out of hand.  Also Many cleric are reporting that they are oor from MA on a CH when they are right on top of them.</div></div><hr />

I know that last night the group's wouldnt show up in players' group windows, and the Raid windows would show like every person in their own group. The way we got it to work was we made all the groups then made the raid from that.</div></div><hr />

I hate the old way. And for a while I had to use shout to communicate with the raid because channels were broken for several people. <br />

There's obviously something going on that needs fixing, and I wish it'd get fixed already.</div></div><hr />
