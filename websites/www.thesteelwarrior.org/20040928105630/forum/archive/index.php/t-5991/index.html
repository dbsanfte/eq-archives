<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wondering what folks' favorite quests have been--either on the level of reward or just plain fun.<br />
Some of mine:<br />
Killing Vengeful Skels in Everfrost/level 12 (absolutely no reward except the heady feeling of revenge)<br />
<br />
Langseax/level 19 (got Langseax of the Wolves and actually used it for a couple levels, hehe)<br />
<br />
Jboots/level 50 (needed lots of help with this one, and the camp is very tedious indeed, but the reward is cool)<br />
<br />
Rallic Pack/level 52 (Fun and a great reward; should have done this one sooner)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Buuhmann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Strength of elements, got all parts in few days, except the WW part which i tracked for like 2 months with my druid until i found out that they moved him on the other end of the zone when they introduced the dragon slayers.....<br />
<br />
And of course Spirit wracked cord, my first 100hp item when my guild was still farming HoT, was amazing how hard work soloing in droga was when i was a poorly equipped 60 warr, and of course the 13h-in-one-session camp of the angry gobbo... :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>shadowedspawn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Originally posted by Brabble <br />
Jboots/level 50 (needed lots of help with this one, and the camp is very tedious indeed, but the reward is cool)  <br />
<br />
I got mine at 35 and the funnest part was running back t the RR in HHK and spamming all my freinds nad seeing them so &quot;WOW&quot;, &quot;grats&quot; and such.<br />
<br />
My favorite has to be the Reaper of the Dead quest in the SK/necro guild in neriak.  You talked to Kizden in WC.  He gave you a note you gave to Skeleon Llord in Befallen.  Then you had to kill your way to the bottom looking for certain named that dropped 3 differnt peices.  You combinded them and got a Thex Mallet (crappy weapon but 20MR and went in range).  You then ran back and turned that in for the RoTD.  <br />
<br />
It was an of 2hs weapong but the effect was the best.  1 charge of Right click instacast CHeal useable from inventory (nerfed to 10 sec cast time now =\).  Just imagine the look on a pally's face when you drop HT then he LoH's and laughs at you cause he's winning (this was pre kunark) and you Cheal yourself 8D.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">warrior rewards<br />
Coldain Rings is definatley one of the most awesome set of quests in game.<br />
Qeynos budge quest<br />
warrior epic<br />
crushbone belts - kaladim good xp/$$$ at low levels :)<br />
<br />
just fun<br />
Soulfire - fun quest<br />
druid/monk/paladin epic<br />
ice comet/staff of the wheel quest<br />
concussion quest<br />
Hukulk's Love/happy love bracelet<br />
iksar monk shackle quests - really well done</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>shadowedspawn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">That reminds me Casai thanks.  I have the faction and Lucan's note (I got bored one night), so I think I'll finish it just beacuse hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Probabally my favorite quest is still my Jagged Blade of War...but after that, handing in the werewolf talon and rubies for my first Crafted Breastplate is a close 2nd.<br />
<br />
The memories of naked corpse runs to Mistmoore. Priceless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">my favorite quest was the Gnashur Furgutt - Brad McQuaid quest, where you get Gnashur's head, turn it into a npc in ranger town, then go to Captain, and he sends an executioner to pwn McQuiad - was the SHIT</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Snowz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Brazen Brass Kilij was pretty L337 back in the day...so was Electrum Bladed Wakizashi quest. Old debate...Yak &gt; EBW  or EBW &gt; Yak.<br />
<br />
Finishing up the Epics by far was the most enjoyable/rewarding quest. I handed everything and camped everything, none of this multi quest mumbo-jumbo. I remember doing a Hate raid and killing Maestro for the hand... when it was a rare drop and get a woody when it did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>FulorianC</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Skeleton Lrodd, damnit! Spell it right and with respect!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Coldain ring quest is my favorite.  Recently did 1 - 8 again solo just for fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sakryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I would have to say the &quot;Spirit of Garzicor&quot; is one of the best quests I have ever done.. the story alone makes the quest worthwhile. The only really difficult part is the ore from Kael ... would advise everyone to take a look at this one for fun!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">&quot;Spirit of Garzicor&quot; is kinda cool but because I hate tradeskills with pation I never finished it. Ore is damn easy now thought since it drops off 2 armors past zek temple. if you have a slower these mobs are so so easy now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tarean</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Back in the day I use to avoid quests like the plague. <br />
<br />
I did enjoy turning in gnoll fangs when I was a young barbi. The sense of being a bounty hunter was very fun. <br />
<br />
I liked the old SS armor quests. Back then it took a guied to get you there. I remeber getting lost in the maze for hours trying to find the right portal combination (right, left, straight, turn around). When I finally found my way to the quest mobs it was a huge feeling of accomplishment. And back then very few people had seen what I saw. It was a good 15min run straight even if you knew where you were going. <br />
<br />
I guess my Signet of Might would count as the most gratifying quest I've done. It took forever, cost me over 800k when I finished. To this day I look at it and tell myself &quot;wow, do I really have this?&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>FulorianC</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Spirit of Garzicor is the best 'quest', as a quest, in the game. I never managed to finish mine, I kept failing one of the folds, over and over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Roughbeard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Aye.. Spirit of Garzicor has  to be one of the best quests in the game. Very cool quest :).. <br />
Certain epics were also fun too. I remember people shouting all over EC looking for help to kill Lucan; everyone that just bought their new shiny toy went over there to try it out and it brought a lot more community feel into the game. <br />
Coldain Rings are very fun to do.. They need more quests like these progression quests. (Scalps, Shackels, Cudgels, Rings.. all very fun)<br />
Everquest needs more quests!<br />
<br />
Rough</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Cimmar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">My favorite quests were most of the newb quests when i first started. Langseax quest was alot of fun and i got a LOW on first try and was able to use the weapon for 10 lvl's until a friend sold me a wurmslayer. The crafted armor quests were fun also I got all but the BP. Most likely this stuff was fun because it was a huge upgrade for me at the time and i was able to use the items i got for a long time. Seru earring quest and eyepatch of plunder suck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Benlin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I have been doing some of the Luclin armour quests (Soldiers armour etc) they have not been too bad.<br />
<br />
I didn't mind the crafted quests.<br />
<br />
I have done some of the LOY spell quests and they have been ok (except the cleric one).<br />
<br />
Makes me wonder just how many unsolved/unkown quests are out there but.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Not a warrior quest, but my favorite quest for story line so far is the initiate symbol of innoruuk quest, the bit where you kill some halfling and get a halfling skin face mask with 1 charge of illusion assling so you can go undercover and collect some note is pretty cool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Rylaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">My favorite quests: <br />
<br />
1. Grand Tunic of the Oracle quest (Phylactery will get you nowehere). <br />
<br />
2. Staff of the Serpent (soloed 95% of it with chanter which was fun). :D<br />
<br />
3. LoY spell quests! I don't know if there is something wrong with me or what but I really liked these quests and did them for my cleric, enchanter and my husbands shaman and paladin.<br />
<br />
I'm sure there's lots more just can't think of anything at the moment. <br />
<br />
I used to hate quests in EQ. I'm not sure when that changed but somewhere along the way it did. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Leitbur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Favorite quests from when I was little till now:<br />
<br />
1. Langsaex of the Wolves (I used this alot more than 2 lvls)<br />
2. Crafted BP (I was so stoked on the way to get this I gave my old BP to my friend before I even had it, so I was bare chested for a while)<br />
3. EBW (One of the coolest looking swords in the game)<br />
4. Jboots <br />
5. Epic (wow)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Frig Coldheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">My first char was a dwarf cleric. I really enjoyed the bone chip and then the CB belt quests. Man that was good exp and cash back then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Let's see...<br />
1) Epics :D<br />
2) Ice Forged Shackles (it was the shit to click and nuke for 12dmg!)<br />
3) Crafted armor (even when the damn jewels were expensive)<br />
4) Gem Inlaid Gauntlets (did them twice, that's when I enjoyed hunting in Paw)<br />
5) Eyepatch of Plunder (&quot;Hey look, SF is up and the zone is empty!&quot; - I was a happy non-camper Hahaha)<br />
6) Myrmidon BP run thru SS... God damn maze<br />
7) The Qeynos badge of honor (It was too late when I figured it lowered faction with corrupt guards :P )<br />
8) Canines quest in FV (Doggie teeth for Cereal!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>macarser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I am about to start my Coldain ring quests, I hope those are going to be fun.<br />
<br />
I just completed the simple but actually fun, EQ 5th Anniversary Quest, and my JBoots was cool too.  I haven't done many but I see some listed here that I want to start.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Batem Tuhates</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Epic hands down for me</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">epic was great</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Yiktin Voxbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Eyepatch was a satisfying one to finish.<br />
<br />
BBK... Man How many times did I do this quest... used to dual wield them....used to cry ZING every 30 secs (was sub 100 sta @ the time) damn heavy bastages... but 10 Dmg O M G ! :p<br />
<br />
No coldain ring.<br />
<br />
Only 2 quests I want to finish now.... gate neck and manly purse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">My favorite quest ever was the Langseax/Langseax of Wolves quest.  Had those damned things for a really long time.  And back in the day the LoW was actually a damned nice 2 hander.  Looked really good with my bronze armor. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Some quests I totally loved doing:<br />
<br />
1- Gnollslayer. When they finally fixed that quest, I loved finishing it. I liked the story. I liked getting the baby back for the family. Made me feel like a hero. I liked going deep into splitpaw to get the last two pieces.<br />
<br />
2- Qeynos Badge of Nobility. I used my new gnollslayer, with gnoll bane damage, on Barducks Darkpaw as I killed him to complete my Badge quest. Then the gnoll war broke out, and it was fun times for me and my friends. The whole zone helped us fight the war. Probably one of the best times I've ever had in EQ. Just a spontaneous sort of event.<br />
<br />
3- Jagged Blade of War. Still the coolest looking reward I ever received for questing in EQ.<br />
<br />
4- Praetor's Blade of Debility. I felt soooo uber getting one of these in my 30s. It prompted me to do rattle off the other Seru quests, the Eye of Trust and the Jeweled Quiver of the Hand. I totally loved Sanctus Seru by then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Derrict</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I don't think anyone mentioned star of eyes quest, a right click identify (from inventory).  It's pretty useless since you can always buy a silvery mask, but if you're a newer player the quest sends you through many old world zones they probably never been in before.  It took roughly 2 hours to finish the quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">As an addendum to what Superchum said about the gnollslayer quest: I noticed that after the first time I gave martin whatshisname his baby back, he still didn't view me as an ally.<br />
Maybe this has changed, but I had to bring his kid back *twice* to be viewed as an ally, lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Coldain ring is definitely the best quest in the game.  More epic than the epics.  <br />
<br />
One of the most fun to do quests I have done was the snare necklace on my DE cleric.  Started it as an untwinked level 7 or so and finished it around 19.  You really get to be an evil dark elf and you get to kill dozens of halflings, as well as wear a halfling illusion and be a spy.  Very cool quest at the level it's meant to be done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>TearsumRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I have to agree with the Coldain ring quest. Not too difficult for low/medium levels to start, just hard enough to make the final reward worth it, and a great storty/background to the quest. The Jagged Blade of War is also right up there for me. From start to finish the JBoW took me about a year and a half to complete.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Bigrin Da Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Blessed (8th) Coldain Prayer Shawl<br />
Signet of Might<br />
Hukulk's Love (Happy Love Bracers)<br />
Fungus Dung Pie<br />
<br />
<br />
Ah, Fungus Dung Pie - food only a troll could love, with it's wonderful line &quot;Meez already made- er, found da dung part.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Bustauff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Would have to be the Epic, that was probably the hardest (at the time) and funnest quest I have done. Although I don't use it for fighting anymore, I do use it as my Traveling Sword. Equipt it anytime I have to run through more than 2 zones. I mean hey, we do have to look good sometimes right.<br />
<br />
Bustauff<br />
Dwarven Godfather</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Fulrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I always have and probably always will hate quests &gt;&lt;. Bad experiences. I remember it took me months and months just to get the parts for the shoulders from SS (can't remember them lol &gt;&lt;) Only to replace them like 3 days later =/. Then theres the time I wanted to get baking up so i could doa quest (again forget) and then I realized that the reward was mainly for casters..i realized this after i did the turn in. So yeah No quests for me drive thru k thx lol</div></div><hr />
