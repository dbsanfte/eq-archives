Aside from the greaves (Just for the utility, greaves would be a down-grade from what you have now, eventually, when your stamina becomes near max) and breastplate, I'd save your cash.</div></div><hr />

Some of the clickies are useless (like the gloves, vambraces, and boots), but some of them are good for utility. The breastplate can heal you, and the greaves turn you invisible. They're both actually good pieces for awhile too, but the stats - and in a few cases, the AC can both be beat by velious quest armors.</div></div><hr />

Did you read the second post in thread???<br />
<br />
it's not quested son. It drops in Old Seb<br />
<br />
Ahh, thats why I looted boots and gloves from yard trash in KC and a guildie got greaves from Venril Sathir.</div></div><hr />

I'm sure Ninjaburger saw your post but still felt the need to take a cheap shot.<br />
<br />
Sending this over to the bunker since it's not quest-related.</div></div><hr />

My normal group doesn't have a shammy, so the clickies are great for me.<br />

Also, I value the greaves tremendously for the effect. Being able to invis oneself and anyone in the group makes these pants invaluable for a warrior. I was offered 60,000 pp for my greaves once and I turned it down. Still wouldnt sell them for that price I think they are that good.<br />
The Bracer is a Must have for any warrior above Gnome/Halfling size in my opinion for the Shrink effect.  Very valuable on those raids where being full sized lags people out of the zone.<br />
Breastplate is Very good until you can get your hands on a Vindi.<br />
Cobalt Bp is comparable to the champions and the culturals that are around.<br />
In all cases I would say they are worth getting IF ( and a big IF ) you can get them as drops and not have to pay the extravagant price tag.<br />
Good Luck!<br />

I wish I could get my hands on the legs, just to have the invis and forget about invis pots :p<br />
Bindwound at 210 and an Embalmers knife sorta makes for the lack of an invingotare clicky... not as good but :p<br />
<br />
Btw, the sign is too damn big lol, and why do you use your Defender's on primary and Mallet on sec? Out of curiosity :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kannan</div><div class="date">08-30-2003, 07:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A quick thought won't the old kunark clicky armors be more valuable once the new expansion is out and you can now add stats to em.<br />
 I play on test server quite a bit and almost all items seem to have atleast 1 slot to upgrade even arrows and such depending on what type of stat slot they add to the item i have seen a few with up to 4 slot types the most common being damage and ac.<br />

P.S. was just wondering if it was worthwhile to buy up a few of em not just the warr types while they were still cheap hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kiya</div><div class="date">08-30-2003, 02:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In my opinion, the breastplate (clicky heal!), greaves (YAY!  free invis!) and bracer (shrink dem fatasses in your raids at last!) are the most valuable.</div></div><hr />

I wore the arms for a LONG.  The boots are still useful when I don't have a shaman for focus in the group.<br />
<br />
If Cobalt upgrades your slot, get it, but with the avalibilty of other player made armors, as well as easily farmed velious armors, I wouldn't sweat it.</div></div><hr />
