<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pssycho</div><div class="date">10-03-2004, 12:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a quick question.  How does one get the Tome of New Beginnings when Tunat is not dead.  I have the key to open Zun's room and start the exped.  I know a few rogues that have got them by hide / sneek / escape.   I see that Sythrak has one and your profile is Authentic cept Warriors dont get hide / sneek / escape.  Also you cant train in there DA to loot them or what ever.  You cannot /open the bones and loot the book, when hostile npcs are around (and the last 3 books are under Tunat's feet).  Let me know whats up if there is some way to do it legal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sythrak</div><div class="date">10-03-2004, 03:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just have a ranger snare the Living Phal's and Tunat, run under them, open, loot the books.<br />
<br />
You're thinking of the hostile npc aggro in a more broad manner, it doesn't work that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pssycho</div><div class="date">10-03-2004, 04:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cool, thanks.  I'm gonna try that tonight.  Whats the trick to get the books behind the Uber snake to the North.  Being the doors are locked and Triton has been the only guild to kill him in game.  We are going back tonight and incase we fail I would like to snag the books to the right before we leave.</div></div><hr />
