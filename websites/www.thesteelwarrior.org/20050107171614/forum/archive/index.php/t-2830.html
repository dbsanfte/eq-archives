According to Caster Realm, damage cap goes away at 20, yet my Tantors Tusk is doing like 60 - 65 max. I guess there is another cap at 30? I've even heard about a cap at 40.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iskandar</div><div class="date">09-01-2003, 06:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Damage caps rise periodically as you level, yes. Think there's another one at 50, then more caps come in smaller increments all the way to 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">09-02-2003, 12:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">it's not 30, it's like uhh...26 or 27 or something that your tantors tusk should start doing 120's.  I had a weighted axe when I hit 20 too, but it wouldn't hit for more than 60 or so until my high 20's, then i started doing the bigger hits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scaleclad</div><div class="date">09-02-2003, 01:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is completely based on my brain, which as a warrior is rattled and squished around alot...however.  I remember a considerable damage jump at 20 when the cap is removed.  And another one at 25 when I got my first damage &quot;bonus&quot; (I was in high keep and feeling arrogantly confident at the time too).  At the time I was talking with some other melee and they mentioned similar damage bonuses every 10 or 5 or so levels, diminishing returns after the cap removed at 20, putting the most noticable jump at 25....but still something to look forward to.<br />
