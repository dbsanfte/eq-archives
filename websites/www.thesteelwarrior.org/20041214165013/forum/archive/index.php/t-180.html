I couldn't afford a shield when I was leveling...and all the shields that I did manage to loot off the skellys I could not equip....got message &quot;You are too short to equip this item&quot; <br />
:o <br />
I am level 25 now and was wondering if I should find a shield that I can equip now and start training bash.<br />

Once you hit level 55 your kicks will have a chance to stun anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kalaz</div><div class="date">04-22-2003, 07:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bash is by no means as important as your other weapon skills, but it is a pretty handy skill to have.  If you're in somewhere like Sebilis before level 55 and need to stop mobs from gating its a good trick to have up your sleeve.<br />
<br />
If you're planning on taking the Warrior to the high end and get involved in some major raids and such, Bash is very nice to have for those occasions when you need to tank-mez stuff.<br />
<br />
Is it important?  Not really.  Is it nice to have for those situations when you need it?  Yes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunrack</div><div class="date">04-22-2003, 10:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am an ogre warrior and I've instead questioned the usefullness of kick for me.  My bash (without a shield) always seemed to do more damage.  Now it does obviously because I haven't used kick and gotten it up in skill level.  But really, would it be a big deal if I never kicked?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Galdaen</div><div class="date">04-22-2003, 10:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you are a small race, the only reason that I can think of to work up your bash skill is if you are planning on using the &quot;ghetto bashing&quot; technique.  That is basically swapping in a shield to bash when fighting a caster when you see him casting, and then swapping back after he is interrupted or successfully casts.  Some warriors are very good at this, and it is much easier to set this up effectively under the new UI, but it can be a pain and most do not bother.<br />
<br />
If you are a large race, just use Slam instead which uses the bash skill numbers and can also interrupt casters.  At level 55 as previously mentioned, a warriors kick can also interrupt spell casters, so at that point small race warriors just stick with kick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smohg</div><div class="date">04-22-2003, 10:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Remember that now &quot;bash&quot; and &quot;slam&quot; are not the same - there is additional damage for Bash and an aggro bonus for bash. There are also shields that boost the aggro associated with bash.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">04-22-2003, 10:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also worthy of note is the fact that the skill cap for bash is much higher than kick.  At higher level, you'll hit more often with bash than with kick.  If you're a large race, bash(slam) is better.  You might want to max kick out for those times when you're under some form of illusion that doesnt let you use slam.  If you're a small race, you're pretty much stuck with kick unless you want to keep swapping your offhand weapon for a shield, or unless you want to get a furious bash shield for tanking really heavy hitting mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wulfran</div><div class="date">04-22-2003, 11:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nice thing about bash/slam is can stun from level 1 whereas kick stuns from lvl 55 up. Timed stuns on casting mobs (for interupts) is always good.  Its a PITA for short races, due to the necessity of swapping shields in and out but doable if you work at it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">slyse</div><div class="date">04-22-2003, 11:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I always worked up bash on general principle, it was nice to be able to interrupt casters and still be able to do half decent damage.  With the nice furious bash shields out there now though, I'd say bash is really worth it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomnan</div><div class="date">04-22-2003, 06:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the info</div></div><hr />
