<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Chuckles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello, I am new to the game of Everquest, and I want to play a warrior, but my friend says there aren't many new players to play with and warriors need to group to level up.  Does anyone know a good server to play on as a low level warrior, with people who want to group or help fight with a warrior?  I went to the server they had highlighted as a beginner's server, the Stromm server, but no one answered any of my requests to team up and fight things.<br />
<br />
Thankyou very much for any answers to this question, and have a nice day!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Stromm may be your best bet but I haven't played there myself.  While warriors are a grouping class, you probably won't find many groups before level 10 or so (maybe even 20).  You can solo fine for that long at least so I wouldn't waste much time looking for a group at first.  Just kill stuff until it starts to get too tough or have a prohibitive amount of downtime.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Stromm is most newbie-friendly.<br />
<br />
Uh, try for lower-population servers....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vilicontus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Unless I'm mistaken, there is now a tutorial feature in Everquest that teaches some stuff here and there. My friends that have tried it say that it actually brings you up to about level 5 or so. Never tried it though. <br />
<br />
Stromm as a server has a mix of old and new players, despite being called the newbie server. Just solo a bit to maybe level 6 or 7, it's easier to group once you can hit areas that is one step above the newbie grounds near your hometown. That's what I did when I first joined Stromm as a newbie months ago  :D <br />
<br />
Ah the memories of hunting gnolls in blackburrow is priceless  :cool:</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Chuckles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thankyou very much for the replies, I tried the tutorial thingy, and now I have food that adds 4HP :)  I found out you could do the quest multiple times so I made 300 of them so they would last a long time.  I am also wearing the armor the Vah Shir lady gives out.  It was easy to fight alone, so I'll have to tell my friend he was wrong, although the big kobold with the iron ore punched my skull in :)  I am on the stromm server and hopefully when I am no longer able to fight alone there will be people willing to fight with me.<br />
<br />
Thankyou Again, you have been Most Helpful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kamce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Welcome Chuckles to the Warrior class.  If you haven't already noticed, all of us here have metal plates in our head from it being bashed/slashed/punched/kicked/slammed in so many times that we have lost count or is it we just don't know how to count.  I can never remember.  :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Katina108</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">a bucket isn't that bad!! it's the DE chicks one that's horrible, I look like I stepped out of night of the living dead, which is why I normally wear the no graphic helm from Velks, even though it's not as good as the Rallos Zek helm, but I where that during raids, cause it kicks butt. <br />

Anyhoos, Welcome to the Warrior class. I did that tutorial today when I made a new bank mule.. LOL.. I just did the first required part, and I was lvl 3 before I left.. hahahaha</div></div><hr />
