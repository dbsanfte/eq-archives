<br />
im currently packing a whole huge assortment of weapons right now, keepin em all in a EE bag for the weight and all, and i was wondering if anyone could give me some advice on the setup<br />
<br />
ok i just looted a snowchipper on 8th shawl march in iceclad yesterday (grats Baradur on Bristlebane) and i really like it, as soon as i ding 51, (half-way) i wanna throw that up probably in primary<br />
<br />
other items in meh bag include<br />
<br />
Bed Leg Club<br />
Blood Point<br />
Schalugug Spear (spelling?)<br />
barnacle covered axe<br />
paetor's blade of debility<br />
<br />
currently on my server frostbringers have nearly doubled in price to 7500pp and i dont think ill be having one anytime soon, i could probably get an item in the 1k range such as a black blade of tormenting or something<br />
<br />
any recommendations on my setup would be greatly appreciated</div></div><hr />

If you are not MT in the group, go DPS with the snowchipper and your other best dmg weapon in secondary (probably the spear, no clue on what the paetor's blade stats are).<br />
<br />
If you are MT the snowchipper will not cut it for aggro. DD's are virtually ignored by mobs. The barnacle axe in main should be ok for the low 50's. But you may want to sell the chipper and axe and get a Frosty.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lohor</div><div class="date">04-19-2003, 02:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would see if you could pick up a defenders lightblade in bazaar for your offhand, has decent stats and packs a punch to up your dps.  Combined with Snowchipper in your main hand it should be a fairly decent aggro/dps combination.  I would also looking into getting a good 2h like Weighty Polearm for when your not MT.<br />
<br />
The Defenders lightblade is going for 1k -2k on my server right, and the weighty polearm is going very cheap and can be bought for under 500 pp easily</div></div><hr />

I would be willing to sell it MUCH cheaper than 7500 to a younger warrior.. look me up sometime if your interested =)</div></div><hr />
