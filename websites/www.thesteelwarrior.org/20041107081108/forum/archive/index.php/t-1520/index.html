NOTHING else....<br />
<br />
These Clerics will still be used in raids in cheal chains.<br />
Thus they will have a use in raids, an important one.<br />
They can also still be used in groups... but if the warrior's hp drops too fast, they're fucked.<br />

<br />
What would happen if paladins were stripped of their aggro-holding potential or if the average warrior became as good at keeping aggro as paladins? I'll tell you what would happen: paladins wouldn't get into XP groups. Nobody invites paladins as healers; nobody invites them as damage dealers; nobody invites them as buffers/slowers. Paladins are invited to tank, pure and simple. Take their one major ability away from them and you have an utterly broken class.<br />
<br />
Now, one might say a paladin unable to hold aggro isn't any different than a warrior with his current set of abilities, but that is nonsense. <br />
<br />
A warrior and a paladin with equivalent gear will always result in:<br />
<br />
 -- The warrior generating a good deal more damage (much higher skill caps; much better offensive AA abilities.)<br />
<br />
 -- The warrior having higher AC (warriors-only armor affords more AC than equivalent paladin-only armor.)<br />
<br />
 -- The warrior having a significantly greater HP total (at 60th level and beyond, warriors get about 18% more HP per point of Sta than paladins; furthermore, warrior-only armors afford a lot more pure HP bonuses than paladin-only gear.)<br />
<br />
The paladin is able to buff himself and other people with HP and AC, certainly, but in the high-end game, past the point where paladins are able to solo, who cares when those buffs don't stack with superior cleric, druid, ranger, beastlord, and shaman buffs: <br />
<br />
 -- Aegolism and Virtue override all cleric buffs paladin have available at any level. Spells in the Spiritual Vigor and Strength of Tunare lines don't stack with any Brell's buff, and how many players prefer Brell's over Spritual Vigor. <br />
<br />
 -- The paladin-only buff Yaulp IV doesn't stack with Spiritual Strength, a clearly superior Attack buff, rendering Yaulp IV effectively useless.<br />
<br />
 -- Valor of Marr, one of the worst haste spells in the game, doesn't stack with any other haste spell.<br />
<br />
 -- Aura of the Crusader doesn't stack with Protection of the Nine and similar mana regen spells.<br />
<br />
What remains? <br />
<br />
 -- Pacify spells can't affect enemies above 55th level, so high-level paladins aren't better pullers than warriors. <br />
<br />
 -- Paladins have two stuns which actually work on enemies above 55th level, one of which is prohibitively expensive, making it usable not even once every fight--and that when the knight has KEI.<br />
 <br />
 -- Paladins have a nice set of healing spells, but none of them is even half as good as the equivalent cleric heal. There is no paladin 75% CH, mind you.<br />
<br />
 -- Paladins do retain their self-only proc buff, but even with Pious Might in effect, they don't even come close to the damage output of a warrior.<br />
<br />
 -- Paladins do enjoy the ability to CH themselves once every 90 minutes. Once every 90 minutes. Try counting the number of CH's you need while tanking though a 90-minute period. And let's not forget, LoH is frequently interrupted (forcing you to wait 90 minutes for it to refresh) and can't be used when the knight is stunned.<br />
<br />
Not a great deal, eh?<br />
<br />
Even given only the above information, warriors are obviously ahead of paladins in the 55th+ level game, except for the one major fact that paladins hold aggro so much better. <br />
<br />
Now figure in that awe-inspiring array of disciplines warrior enjoy, in particular Defensive and Evasive, and the fact that paladins have on four disciplines, all of which are effectively useless (Sanctification, the one single discipline which might have made a significant difference under the right circumstances, has a duration of a ridiculous 10 seconds.)<br />
<br />
Yes, I can see how taking away paladin stun aggro would make things so very balanced.<br />
<br />
At the bottom line, there can only be one &quot;best&quot; tanking class in XP parties, and right now, it is the paladin class. Warriors continue to reign supreme as tanks in the raid department, a part of the game where paladins have never been popular except as group healers against enemies with AE DD effects. There is, in other words, room for both. <br />
<br />
Now, if you were to hand the XP tanking crown to warriors, paladins would, for the sake of balance, have to become the kings of raid-tanking, and that would imply taking away the Defensive and Evasive disciplines from warriors and passing them on to us knights. Is that something you would appreciate?<br />

[B]Time for a paladin to put things into perspective. <br />
<br />
Sounds to me more like time for another Paladin to get paranoid =)<br />
<br />
What would happen if paladins were stripped of their aggro-holding potential or if the average warrior became as good at keeping aggro as paladins? (snip)<br />
<br />
Noone's asking pallies to be stripped entirely of their aggro holding potential OR to make warriors just as good as paladins on aggro. What the warrior community IS asking is to have the huge disparity reduced. Preferably without nerfing Paladins. We want the aggro ability knights have balanced so that while we are given increased aggro abilities, knights still retain their advantage.<br />
<br />
A warrior and a paladin with equivalent gear will always result in:<br />
<br />
 -- The warrior generating a good deal more damage (much higher skill caps; much better offensive AA abilities.)<br />
<br />
MUCH higher skill caps? Tell me, when did 10% become a large amount? Cause that's all the difference. As for the AA abilities, I agree we get a few more than you do offensive wise, but you get all the ones we get defensive wise. Do you really think you should get all the offensive AA's of a warrior as a defensive styled knight? Come on. And your DPS isn't that much lower than warriors, with all the sweet 2handers out there.<br />
<br />
 -- The warrior having a significantly greater HP total (at 60th level and beyond, warriors get about 18% more HP per point of Sta than paladins; furthermore, warrior-only armors afford a lot more pure HP bonuses than paladin-only gear.)<br />
<br />
The difference between warrior and paladin hitpoints after buffs are taken into account is 10%. That's not nearly as significant as you think.<br />
<br />
 -- Aegolism and Virtue override all cleric buffs paladin have available at any level. Spells in the Spiritual Vigor and Strength of Tunare lines don't stack with any Brell's buff, and how many players prefer Brell's over Spritual Vigor.<br />
<br />
Yeah? So? Just about every group I've ever been in has had vitrue or Aego, so that's pretty much pointless. And you have BSS and AoTC, both of which stack with Virtue.<br />
<br />
-- The paladin-only buff Yaulp IV doesn't stack with Spiritual Strength, a clearly superior Attack buff, rendering Yaulp IV effectively useless.<br />
-- Valor of Marr, one of the worst haste spells in the game, doesn't stack with any other haste spell.<br />
<br />
Spells don't stack with spells that provide the same benefit by an inferior amount. This is just how the game is designed. Yuo need to use one, or the other.<br />
<br />
 -- Aura of the Crusader doesn't stack with Protection of the Nine and similar mana regen spells.<br />
<br />
Quit your complaining and break out the Symbols that you have that DO stack with PoT9.<br />
<br />
 -- Pacify spells can't affect enemies above 55th level, so high-level paladins aren't better pullers than warriors.<br />
<br />
Yes, they are. They can pull with stun and lock aggro before ever getting them in camp. Warriors can't. Ergo, pallies are better pulelrs.<br />
<br />
 -- Paladins have two stuns which actually work on enemies above 55th level, one of which is prohibitively expensive, making it usable not even once every fight--and that when the knight has KEI.<br />
<br />
Sure you do. Break out your Cease and Desist and get your aggro for cheap mana. The stun won't take effect, but the aggro sure will, and it's the aggro that counts. I shouldn't be having to tell you this, but I'm really getting the impression you're presenting Paladins in the worst possible light to make your points. Unless you're talking about actually stunning the mob to reduce the damage you take. Oh, and btw... if one's too expensive... DON'T use it! this doesn't seem to hard to understand to me. Use your 65 mana stun, not your 200 mana one... just makes sense to me!<br />
 <br />
 -- Paladins have a nice set of healing spells, but none of them is even half as good as the equivalent cleric heal. There is no paladin 75% CH, mind you.<br />
<br />
What's your point? that's not your niche. Your niche is in having the fasteast heals in the game, being able to heal the group, and be a secondary healer. The pallies I know do very well at filling in spot heals here and there and saving cleric mana. Don't tell me you WANT to be even nearly as good of a cleric? First you're bitching about not having all the offensive AA's of the warriors, now you're complaining about not healing as well as a cleric? Good God, what do you WANT here?<br />
<br />
 -- Paladins do retain their self-only proc buff, but even with Pious Might in effect, they don't even come close to the damage output of a warrior.<br />
<br />
Don't even come close? You're exaggerating again. Pallies probably do 80-90% of the damage warriors do. Mind you, that's about in line with your other exxagerated remarks.<br />
<br />
Even given only the above information, warriors are obviously ahead of paladins in the 55th+ level game, except for the one major fact that paladins hold aggro so much better.<br />
<br />
That single fact is enough to more than overshadow ALL the minor benefits warriors enjoy over hybrids. <br />
<br />
Now figure in that awe-inspiring array of disciplines warrior enjoy, in particular Defensive and Evasive<br />
<br />
None of which are used 99% of the time. All the long lasting damage increasers force the warrior to take more damage as well. All the short duration discs tha tincrease damage but don't increase damage taken last mere seconds and they have an incredibly long refresh time. No, warriors just about always save it for Defensive. And you know how much that gets used? You know that LoH you were just complaining about? Yeah. We use defensive about as much as you use LoH.<br />
<br />
Yes, I can see how taking away paladin stun aggro would make things so very balanced.<br />
<br />
Again, noone but you's saying that warrior stun aggro is going to be taken away.<br />
<br />
At the bottom line, there can only be one &quot;best&quot; tanking class in XP parties, and right now, it is the paladin class. Warriors continue to reign supreme as tanks in the raid department, a part of the game where paladins have never been popular except as group healers against enemies with AE DD effects. There is, in other words, room for both.<br />
<br />
Actually, hybrids are ALSO very welcome in raids as CC tanks, or even as Main tanks on trash mobs due to their snap aggro generation capabilities. So they have their role there too. As for paladins being the ones that reign supreme in groups, that's unacceptable to me. Warriors give away EVERYTHING to be the best tank. We have no utility, no flexibility. We do ONE thing, and that's tank. You hybrids got your spells, you've got your flexibility and utility, even soloability, that's your price. Now pay it.<br />
<br />
This shows how this stuff is REALLY broken tho.<br />
<br />
Had a paladin and a warrior in a pickup group the other day. Paladin had 5khp and a Facesmasher, Baron title, level 64. Warrior had 8khp, Hategiver and BoC, Veteran title, level 65.<br />
<br />
Pally was tanking for a bit, chanter slowed on inc, there were no problems. <br />
<br />
Warrior takes over with two of the best warrior aggro weapons in the game... Both in the top 5. Chanter slows on inc, chanter kept getting aggro and pounded on. Chanter dies.<br />
<br />
Now this stupid friggin chanter who couldn't manage her aggro or learn to work with a warrior tank whined and bitched and complained that she wanted the paladin that was half as good of a tank as the vastly better equipped warrior, and finally left the group. All because the 5khp crappy paladin wouldn't tank instead of the 8khp warrior.<br />
<br />
That kind of crap just absolutely pisses me off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Secondary question:<br />
Since this is just about the case, why is it druids still complain about not being able to find groups?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Calinthalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Take a for instance, we had a Pally MT the Statue of Rallos Zek a week or so ago.  Now, why do you ask.......cause we wanted to see him do it.  We almost let a Ranger tank him :)  Now, granted we wouldn't dream of letting a Pally or a Ranger tank AoW, or someone that hits harder than that.  But the point has been made.  If a Pally can tank Statue with no problems then the mobs your xp group is killing shouldn't be a challange.  As it stand right now Warriors have no &quot;niche&quot; we can tank the big mobs at raids.  While I enjoy that it sure doesn't add to my AA count.  I can't go to a pickup group and get XP cause they finger wagglers figure they can get more DPS out if a Pally tanks.  So, what am I supposed to do?  Pallies can solo some, they have backup heals (that are very nice BTW), they can self buff, they do extreme damage against undead......and they can hold agro and guarentee they won't lose it.  What do warriors get.......well, I can take a good punch.  However, I can't solo light blues without stoping to Bind Wounds up to 70% before pulling my next mob......and I better be close to the zone line.  My DPS is negligable (around 60 last night), I have to have agro handed to me by my group.  <br />
<br />
I dont' play a hybrid, I dont' play a caster.....I'm a Tank....that's what I do, however, SOE apparently only wants me to do it at raids, and if I want XP I better have friends online because pickup groups would rather have the Pally.  Now, you're saying if they bump warriors back up to be the main choice for raids and xp groups where are pallies?  In CoD dishing out mad damage to any and all undead they can find.......and spot healing me for the cleric........and giving me BSS when it falls.  Also, they can backup tank for me if we get two unmezzables in camp.  This is how it used to be, who knows why it's not that way anymore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
You're missing the point.  Go back and read the original comparison.<br />
<br />
Warriors and their discipline can be compared to Clerics with ONE spell, CH.<br />
<br />
These clerics can still be used in CHC's!<br />
<br />
Warriors can still be used in raids to tank bosses that require disc!<br />
<br />
The whole fucking point of this thread was to make clear that forcing a class to be a one-trick pony ISN'T FUN and isn't balanced.  Did that just go over your head???  Were we comparing ourselves to paladins??<br />
<br />
Whoop de fucking do, warriors can do ONE thing and ONE thing only, and that is TANK.  If we can't get aggro, we can't TANK.  We aren't taken into an exp group because we do 10% better damage (on non-undead).  We're taken because we can fucking take hits!  Do you see the ability to do anything else?  Do you?  If so please take some time from belittling your class and point it right out!<br />
<br />
Warriors are a *one trick pony*.  We have the ability to tank but due to aggro issues and lack of utility we're increasingly being pushed toward a narrow role: that of tanking bosses who require /disc defensive.   Some of us don't like this and are asking to be made a bit more viable in other places like, say, xp groups.  Some of us want aggro issues to be more *balanced.*  As in, we don't like wielding EB weapons and losing aggro at the drop of a hat to tash.  We don't feel it's fun.  <br />
<br />
Maybe that made it a little clearer for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Karnos Darkmere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">You're missing the point.No, you are missing the point. Just like warriors, paladins are able to do one thing, and one thing only, which is needed by a party: tank. The crucial difference, however, is that we tank worse than warriors. The sole, but certainly major, advantage we hold over warriors while in a group is our ability to keep rock-solid aggro. Now, if SOE were to make it easily possible for warriors to hold aggro, then who would invite a paladin to an XP party? <br />
<br />
So, the point really is, you could improve warrior hate generation, but as a side effect, you would simply relegate paladins to the same position warriors currently occupy, with the additional twist that we don't enjoy any of your special advantages nor are we able to match you in terms of average Str, Sta, Agi, Dex, AC, HP, or DPS (the first four stats because of permissible races.) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Karnos Darkmere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I'm a TankThat is just it, though; most paladins and shadow knights consider themselves tanks, too, yet most warriors seem overly eager to reduce us to nothing more than crowd controller and patch healers. You claim that is our role, but what makes your view any more right than ours?<br />
<br />
Now, you're saying if they bump warriors back up to be the main choice for raids and xp groups where are pallies? In CoD dishing out mad damage to any and all undead they can findI don't know how it works on blue servers, but on Firiona Vie, it is virtually impossible to find a CoD party (I have been able to get three such parties going the last half year), and nothing in CoD is soloable. Heck, no matter the zone or enemy, once you hit 60th as a paladin, what little soloing ability you retained is lost.<br />
<br />
And just for the record, buffed to the teeth by 65th level casters, having Combat Fury 3, Fury of the Ages 1, and Slay Undead 2, wielding the Sword of Ssraeshza, wearing Aura of Bravery and Aura of Battle items, and using all the anti-undead DD spells possible, I still haven't been able to push my DPS past 72 against valorous spirits in the HoH. That hardly constitutes &quot;mad damage&quot; in my book, especially considering it is highly situational.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Karnos Darkmere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">MUCH higher skill caps? Tell me, when did 10% become a large amount?Because of the way the Attack vs Mitigation compare works (do some log parsing to get a suitable base of empirical evidence and form your own impression), a 10% numeric difference in skill certainly doesn't constitute a mere 10% difference in terms of DPS. There is nothing whatsoever linear about the damage progression in EQ. <br />
<br />
Furthermore, Attack is based on not one but two skills: the relevant weapon type skill as well as Offensive. Warriors are ahead in both those skills, giving them even more of a cumulative offensive advantage.<br />
<br />
Come on. And your DPS isn't that much lower than warriors, with all the sweet 2handers out there.Warriors are free to use those sweet two-handers, too, all the while retaining their offensive advantage over paladins.<br />
<br />
As for the AA abilities, I agree we get a few more than you do offensive wise, but you get all the ones we get defensive wise.Indeed, but some of them are worth more to you. You gain 18% more HP per point of Stamina than shadow knights and paladins; hence, you gain close to 18% more HP per AA point invested in Natural Durability and the like.<br />
<br />
Just about every group I've ever been in has had vitrue or AegoMy point exactly: paladins buffs aren't of much use in most groups.<br />
<br />
Quit your complaining and break out the Symbols that you have that DO stack with PoT9.You just stated that most groups have Aegolism or Virtue; hence, it follows that the same groups also have access to Symbols superior to anything a paladin gets. Thanks for making my point again.<br />
<br />
Do you really think you should get all the offensive AA's of a warrior as a defensive styled knight?Not at all. I think paladins should be recognized by warriors as being at least as focused on tanking as your own class precisely because we lack those offensive disciplines. We are not damage dealers. We are not healers. We are not buffers. We are aggro generators and meat shields. As simple as that.<br />

we don't have 2million Warrior only swords out there,<br />
we don't have LoH,<br />
we don't have mana,<br />
we have NO MEANS OF HEALING OURSELVES (oh yeah, bind wound)<br />
<br />
and for this loss, <br />
you think we only deserve a small tanking boost? Which is nullified by the fact that we can't keep the mobs on us.<br />
<br />
<br />
And again, YOU ARE MISSING THE POINT OF THIS THREAD.<br />
<br />
It was a comparison,<br />
we get ONE thing that keeps us usefull in raids (defensive), and that's the ONLY thing we get.<br />
<br />
Paladins get ONE thing that makes them usefull in raids, (huge aggro)..<br />
but they also get root, heals, pacify, undead nukes etc etc......<br />
<br />
THAT is the point of this thread,<br />
and you MISSED it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Of course, unless you think that a cleric with ONLY Complete Heal and nothing else... would be balanced vs a Druid with all their spells...<br />
but if you think that... then... you should go work at SOE, im sure they're craving for people that think like you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">:rolleyes: @ Karnos<br />
<br />
go talk to some of the people who play your class well  about how aggro is your only benefit to a group....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Tugurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I love these paladins with whole spellbooks including stuff like rez, root, many stuns, fast heals, group heals, buffs, self-haste etc, mana pools at 65 ranging from 3000-6000, fast mana regen all over the place, sitting there minimizing all this stuff, like it doesn't mean anything. <br />
<br />
With shaman healers they have MORE hps; with druids hps they have equivalent hps. They talk about skill caps, forgetting to mention that they have the *same* defensive caps, mitigation and avoidance skills that amount to a 1.5% difference, and maybe 10% less dps (but not on undead flagged mobs).<br />
<br />
And now he says we can use high dps 2handers too. Sure, if we gimp our aggro even more. See, most warriors like me use subpar dps 1handers because those are the ones we busted hump getting because they have aggro procs.<br />
<br />
Who says we aren't talking about nerfing paladin aggro? I say nerf it hard. No aggro on stuns that don't actually stun would be a place to start.</div></div><hr />

[B]Because of the way the Attack vs Mitigation compare works<br />
<br />
Furthermore, Attack is based on not one but two skills: the relevant weapon type skill as well as Offensive. Warriors are ahead in both those skills, giving them even more of a cumulative offensive advantage.<br />
<br />
Agreed on offense is based on more than one skill, but it doesn't make as huge of a difference as you are saying. As you're so busy trying to minimize every strength knights have, I think you know that, but choose to overdramatize the difference.<br />
<br />
Warriors are free to use those sweet two-handers, too, all the while retaining their offensive advantage over paladins.<br />
<br />
For the most part, we're not. You see, we have to dump everything in our weapons in favor of aggro. We're not able to use almost any of the 2handers, due to them not having decent aggro. We're pretty much forced to use DW until BoW. In fact, we as warriors can't even take the best damage weapons we can find... we have to turn them down for the lesser damaging but higher aggro weapons. So no, we don't.<br />
<br />
Indeed, but some of them are worth more to you. You gain 18% more HP per point of Stamina than shadow knights and paladins; hence, you gain close to 18% more HP per AA point invested in Natural Durability and the like.<br />
<br />
Getting 18% more per sta has very little to do with getting 18% more per AA in ND. In fact we might get 5% more per ND due to it. MAYBE. It affects the sta, yes, but it affectrs the base hitpoints as well. By the way, the hps I get with a nearly maxed sta account for 20% of my hitpoints. 18% of 20% is far less than you're making it out to be.<br />
<br />
My point exactly: paladins buffs aren't of much use in most groups.<br />
<br />
Bullcrap. BMB is ALWAYS used in groups. And you know what? You're a hybrid. Just like any other hybrid, you shouldn't be considered much of a group buffer.<br />
<br />
You just stated that most groups have Aegolism or Virtue; hence, it follows that the same groups also have access to Symbols superior to anything a paladin gets. Thanks for making my point again.<br />
<br />
Um, actually no. See, hence the word, MOST. If you'd actaully stopped to think, you'd realize that those groups WITHOUT clerics and with druids for a healer, you can break out your symbols and do a buff that stacks with PoT9. Or even with a shaman healer, you can buff the whole group with cleric buffs. Of course, you're trying to downplay all the advantages for hybrids, so I didn't expect you to mention that.<br />
<br />
Not at all. I think paladins should be recognized by warriors as being at least as focused on tanking as your own class precisely because we lack those offensive disciplines. We are not damage dealers. We are not healers. We are not buffers. We are aggro generators and meat shields. As simple as that.<br />
<br />
.... and you just happen to have a spell book, with stuns, heals, group heals, including the fastest heal in the game, ghetto CC in root, cleric buffs that only the cleric in the game is better at, aggro generation which is by far the best in game along with SK's... oh yeah, you're not asking for much. Tell me, take that spellbook for granted much? Sure, you can have those disciplines, we'll even give you DW and up your offense and defense a little bit.... just as soon as you give up all your spells and mana, and LoH. Oh, and, have fun trying to keep aggro.<br />
<br />
You DO do nearly the damage of a warrior. You DO patch heal, you DO buff every group you're in with at least one buff. And you've got nearly the best aggro in the game, you're a meatshield who's actually able to heal himself. Not to mention, you're the only other class in the game that can rez without a reagent!<br />
<br />
I'll be blunt.<br />
Quit your whining. It's obvious all you're doing is trying your best to downplay everything a paladin can do because you don't want either a: hybrid aggro nerfed, or b: warriors to be fixed so they're actually competition for you in XP groups. In short, you've got it good, and you feel threatened.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>czai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">So, the point really is, you could improve warrior hate generation, but as a side effect, you would simply relegate paladins to the same position warriors currently occupy,....<br />
<br />
No.  The point of this thread was NEVER about improving warrior hate.<br />
<br />
Quit belittling your class, get your head out of the sand and go read the first post again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Calinthalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I'll be truthfull upfront.  I group with Pallies all the time.  I have several very good Pallies in my guild that I group with a good bit, not only at raids, but in xp groups.  Now, unlike some Paladins I see, they know their place, and are very good at thier jobs.  The only time I have to relegate myself to DPS is somewhere like CoD where with the damage that they dish out (which, btw is alot more than 70DPS, it's more in the neighborhood of 120DPS a full twice my measily 60 or so) I can't have agro no matter what them or I do.  The GOOD Paladins buff the group with BSS, run DPS, group heal when a couple of members have been hurt, stun casters when they get to gate area health, snap a quick heal on me if the CH from the cleric is running late or if I have more than two mobs on me at one time to save the agro from the cleric, they offtank the unmezzable adds, and when we just have one mob in camp they don't stun untill gate area hps and they dish out damage.  Quite frankly I love having a Paladin in my group, I like the backup if the fecal material strikes the rotating blades.  They are very usefull and welcome in my xp group at anytime.<br />
<br />
However, once again, I AM A TANK.  I can do absolutly nothing else.  You say warriors outdamage Paladins, well fine then.....you are the only one we do.  If a group is looking for DPS they surely are gonna put a warrior at the bottom of the potentials list....they want Wizards, rogues, and rangers.  If they are a caster heavy group they want a Paladin to tank so that they can overnuke at will.  So tell me oh wise one, what do they want warriors for?  I'll tell you what, they send you a tell when you've been LFG for a couple of hours because they've had a rare named pop in Tactics or BoT and the Pally didn't have /defensive so could you just come and help them kill that one mob?  Then ten minutes later you're back to LFG and the Pally is tanking while you try and figure out a tradeskill you can work on while LFG with your measily 80Wis, and watching some movie on TV.<br />
<br />
You see, while your in a group that you don't tank in you can snap off backup heals, buff the group, LoH the tank if necissary, stun the gaters and root the adds.  If I'm in a group where I don't tank I get to hit auto-attack and follow the mob around hoping for an add I can off-tank because I can do nothing else.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Very simple,<br />
paladins are a class that do a lot of things, but aren't the best in any of those domains. <br />
So they think that unbalancing aggro is a decent reward for sucking at everything else.<br />
<br />
Here is a little hint for the other paladins that might be as clueless as our fellow Sir....<br />
<br />
Want to BUFF? make a BUFF CLASS<br />
Want to HEAL? make a HEALER<br />
Want to do DAMAGE? make a DAMAGE DEALER<br />
Want to TANK? make a WARRIOR<br />
Want to do a little of them all? make a KNIGHT<br />
<br />
(I wish... currently the game is fecked up, and you better take a Knight if you want to be a good tank in non raid occasions...)</div></div><hr />
