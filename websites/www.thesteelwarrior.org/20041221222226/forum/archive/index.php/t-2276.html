<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">07-31-2003, 09:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">lets call them baby named. they are in 4 planes - they all have phs, there are no spawns you can kill with a single group that are 3 day spawns.<br />
<br />
if you xp regularily in any of the zones, you will eventually see them. most of them in pow are in the 2nd big open area if you hug right. all the traps in earth are phs for named. several named spawn all over fire, 3 up front, 3 more in the mephit village, several in the first fortress, few out in the field past the first bridge, and even few more in the 2nd fortress.  really only the warlord spawn is accessible in poa, others would take forever to clear to although i assume one group could do a few of the named in the avatar houses.<br />
<br />
if you go after server up can see most them, named have high chance to spawn on server up.</div></div><hr />

Warping your tank into 3 Castellans = the end for one group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hinanek</div><div class="date">08-05-2003, 03:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guild just recently entered EPs, have been grouping in earth alot and found that by kiling the yellow con muddites around the temple spawned something called the sludge lurker or something, anyways we never ended up killing it but have heard ppl say he is 1 groupable, but then again they could be talking out of their asses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">08-05-2003, 05:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">killing the walkers spawns the lurkers, if u kill all the lurkers it spawns other stuff who eventually spawns the named if the ring hasnt been done in the last 3 days. if it has been done in the last 3 days, u get a silly ph which sucks beyond belief since i know of no way to tell whether the ring is up or not except to ask around and hope ppl dont lie haha.<br />
<br />
doesnt take many ppl to do the rings so hard to keep track of it.</div></div><hr />
