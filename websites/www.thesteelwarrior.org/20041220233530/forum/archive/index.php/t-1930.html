<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mightyberge</div><div class="date">07-14-2003, 05:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guild is going for emperor very soon, and in researching the info I see alot of conflicting info in regards to good selection of weapons  for the MA. i will be the MA, and have for weapon choice  BOC, CORDED-SPIKE hammer, and Stormrider carepace(FB4 shield) for EB weapons and of course a 1hs bane weapon. <br />
<br />
i know  several post say use boc/bane while i read some post that say's use 2 eb weapons  for first few secs of fight then switch to  a bane 2hs weapon. i do not have punishing blade yet as AA abilty yet.<br />
<br />
so, in a nutshell, question im posing is<br />
<br />
 A.  what  is a better as MA  duel wield  with bane weapon and a eb weapon  or use 2hs bane weapon (no punishing blade aabilty yet).<br />
<br />
thanks for help.</div></div><hr />

(Which of course implies you get normal DPS agro)<br />
<br />
You Slash Emp of SSRA for 300dmg.<br />
Emp of SSRA was hit for 0 melee dmg.<br />
<br />
He WILL hate you just as much as if u had slashed for 300.<br />
<br />
That is an absolute certainty since i have pulled agro without a bane.<br />
And can tank without bane and procs.<br />
<br />
Bane is ONLY for DPS. You do not need it to tank emp (or seru).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trast</div><div class="date">07-14-2003, 02:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guild recently downed the Emperor and I was MA for both kills we have done. What I used was my BoC and my Bane 1hs for the first few moments to get its attention then switched to in my Stormrider Carapace into my secondary. I had no trouble at all keeping aggro with this combo. Just remember to have someone ready to GRC you and Spellshield you everytime his 4k spell hits you and you are home free.</div></div><hr />

Did lose agro during enrage and had a pair of rangers die so was worth it.</div></div><hr />

ROFL :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarelin</div><div class="date">07-15-2003, 02:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tanked emperor with a 2h-er bane a few nights ago. Had no aggro issues at all except for one moment where I got bashed/stunned out of the corner, stunned, then bashed/stunned again and wasn't doing any damage for 20 or so seconds. Ae taunt was up so I backed up back into my corner and used it. <br />
<br />
Yeah we corner pin him.<br />
<br />
DPS is so high with the 2h-er that I don't lose aggro during enrage either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mightyberge</div><div class="date">07-15-2003, 05:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks all,this info really helps alot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mackdaddy</div><div class="date">07-18-2003, 12:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am on Luclin server and we just took out Emperor for the first time on our first attempt, WHOOT...  Anyways what I wanted to ask was during the fight our MT asked us to /shield him after or during the Proc every minute.  I thought not a bad Idea but as we started to fight and I did this it seemed like a bad Idea cause everytime it procd a second War needed a heal which in the end caused us to have very lil mana at the end (I know its common to have troubles with mana at end of fight).  I think going at a 2 sec rotation is sufficient to take care of the Healing on MT that has like 6200 HP unbuffed without /shielding, any advice ?<br />
<br />
Also do you put emp in the corner using small illusion like gnome in the corner?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Binnamar</div><div class="date">07-19-2003, 12:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anyone notice if bane has more agro if the bane damage is in effect?<br />
<br />
Just something I was wondering when I read the thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chatja ogre</div><div class="date">07-19-2003, 09:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Back in the days we used to use a 4 sec rotation while disced and 3 sec when down. I had max 7200 fully buffed back then I lived thru entire emp fights (30 40 mins :P) so its not that hard anymore.<br />
<br />
All you want to do is to get a SS after the emp touch (3.3k dd all of the sudden) and just before the next proc really.<br />
<br />
There was a period in december where the proc couldnt be cured and we killed him anyway with me holding aggro thru the entire fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mackdaddy</div><div class="date">07-19-2003, 01:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anyone have any advice on the Shield comment I asked earlier?  And also the Gnome illusion in the corner...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vladimoir</div><div class="date">07-19-2003, 04:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Never used the shield idea either, honestly unless your flooded with healing it sounds like a terrible idea.  In all the times tanking Emp I don't think I've ever died to a melee round with a 3 or 4 cleric chain.  Only time I've ever died to Emp was off a 4k proc at an unlucky time.  As mentioned above use spellshield to counteract 700 of that. <br />
<br />
The one thing I noticed making the biggest difference in tanking the emperor is reading the uber tanking information we have here on the site and using evasive instead of defense against Emperor.  My first fight I used defensive and my clerics found my hp to spike a lot which is quite unusual for defensive.  Using evasive the clerics felt like not only was I taking less damage but they didn't feel it was spiking as much either.</div></div><hr />
