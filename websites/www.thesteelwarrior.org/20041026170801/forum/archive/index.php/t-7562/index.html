<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Callon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If they add it, I think there will be balance issues.  You can already get some nice gear for the difficulty level (lack thereof) of tearing through normal LDoNs over and over and over... yeah, it takes a long time, but it's very easy for what you can get.  For risk versus reward to make any sense at all, gear that's better than what's available now cannot be purchased just by getting more adventure points from ldon normals.  <br />
<br />
There are some invis armor slots that could support some better ldon pieces without  being out of balance.  For most upgrades though, to be fair they'd need a new points system.  Maybe you must earn your points in ldon hards to get the over 1492 pt upgrades.  Maybe there are new instanced zones for it that use a separate set of points (as the expedition system could have supported).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Alisdahre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'd agree with only points from high risk LDoNs being usable for elemental quality LDoN armors.<br />

That way, not just anyone can farm like mad till they can go straight from Crusty to Elemental.  But rather, they'd have a progression to go through.  They'd have to farm to get full LDoN regular armor to be big enough to handle high risk LDoNs to get the elemental-esk sets.<br />
<br />
Course, an argument for the other side, risk vs. reward isn't always the case when talking about raids vs. LDoN either.  I know too many people who just hopped straight into huge guilds.  They go to raids but do virtually nothing other than hit auto-attack and go afk.  Or they debuff the mob then are able to go afk.  It's not that they don't do their jobs so much as it is they don't have a job to do.

<br />
i agree with your first statement<br />
doing reg ldon over and over should not yield the same results as killing mobs that require full raids.<br />
i have never ever been one rounded in reg ldon<br />
i have never had mobs do unresistable ae for several k hp in reg ldon (or any ae that i recall)<br />
i have never been swarmed by unmezzalbe adds that quad for 1k+ in reg ldon<br />
i have never seen anything at all in reg ldon that makes me think you should get any kind of rewards that are on par with elemental loot. there is already gear there that will hold most folks til elementals or beyond<br />
<br />
however i do not agree that casual players should get the same quality rewards as hardcore raiders<br />
<br />
raiders kill GODS, you know, the beings that created the fricking planet and races. they SHOULD have better loot than some single groupable mob<br />
<br />
regardless of how many cogs are on the wheel, they are all there for a reason, i cant think of a raid i ever went on where we said. wow this is overkill, guess some of you guys should log or go do something else so everyone will be busy at all times and leave zero room for error<br />
<br />
people that sit thru shit like VT and emp key farming, vt clearings, pop backflagging,  elemental ring events, time clearing, and gayass GoD events etc deserve good loot, they killed the hardest mobs and did the hardest quests<br />
<br />
you sure are a mighty cocky guy too, talking about how much more skilled you are than the guys who are ahead of you in game. sounds more like sour grapes to me, but hey, what do i know, im just a fat kid</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Callon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Err... Ibithor, he's right to say that just because someone is &quot;ahead of you&quot; in the game progression doesn't mean that person is more skilled.  They may have basically leeched their flags and better gear off skilled raiders.  I've grouped with people from high end raid guilds on occasion who utterly sucked.  <br />
<br />
But I also stand by my original post, that the gear from harder areas should be better, plain and simple, and if they added elemental quality gear that could be bought with points, it shouldn't be obtainable through ldon normal points.  If someone sucks and their skilled guild decides to give them flags and &quot;phat lewtz&quot; anyway, that's their affair.  The guild as a whole clearly had enough ability (and time of course) to take down the mobs.</div></div><hr />

Let me guess, farming EC to put 40hp augs on and still having that 70hp gain over the causal is not good enough?</div></div><hr />

I have about 30 AC (raw) upgradeable in LDoN--leaving me marginal in GoD at best. ,,!, ,!,,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Fynepisa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">First off, you can do GoD fine (even Ikkinz) with just LDoN/bazaar gear. I'm sure OoW will be new story, but I think the current LDoN really is good enough for what it is.<br />
<br />
As for casually grinding away adventure after adventure to get elemental quality armor, I don't see any problem with it.  It's what casual players have always done, especially in the old days where you could actually purchase most of the top loot since it was almost all droppable. You save up small chunks of money from the casual stuff you do, and you put it all together and get a nice raid level item.  Same concept for LDoN.<br />
<br />
I think the best way to balance putting really nice loot on merchants is to simply make it cost a lot of points, and scale the points considerably. Maybe even put in a new adventure guy at each camp that only gives out very hard adventures to level 70s. If they stick with the pattern up to this point then the normal level 70 adventures will be the same as the current 65 hards and worth 105 points. Maybe make high risk 70s worth 300+ and make the new guy with very hard adventures be double that. Then make the armor cost like 4500 points. This would make it possible to casually grind for the armor, but it wouldn't really be efficient unless you did the harder difficulties thus giving anyone the chance for the armor, but rewarding those who actually challenge themselves.</div></div><hr />

LDoN was quite balanced for the &quot;avg lvl65 aiming at Miragul Plate&quot;.<br />
75 points per night isnt too impossible to make, 10 nights of work.<br />
<br />
Once you started adding augments prices went crazy.<br />
I wont even talk about Takish Plate which is an insult.<br />

750 points =  75hp BP<br />

Many guilds who are in a high-competition tier (e.g. elemental planes today) have a loot acquisition rate similar to what you just described.  Life is quite different outside of the heavy-farm tiers like VT, Time and Qvic.  I've been in both types of guilds in the past and can attest to it personally.</div></div><hr />

I couldn't agree more. IMO point costs are almost twice as much as they should be, or adventure rewards are 50% what they should be. People always seem to quote figures based on hard missions but fail to take into account the fact that most people that could use the upgrade can't do hard missions in the first place. Nevermind the fact that 75% win is very optimistic with a pickup group and so is 2 sessions a day still takes 4-5 hours for many people. That's a lot of damn work.<br />
<br />
If your raiding and putting in that ammount of time and not getting gear upgrades faster than that, you guild seriously needs to look at thier itenerary cause either you're doing trival content where you've already go all the drops, or your guild has a really screwy system inplace to reward its players. In which case your experience in the matter doesn't really apply.</div></div><hr />

Someone already addressed this.  Casuals will not be getting Time and OoW armor sets from LDoN.  Elemental gear will be what ToV gear is today by the time LDoN is upgraded most likely, or at least eventually in the future.  You know, ToV gear, the shit I can 3-box for right now.<br />

<br />
  No, this is about right for raiding guilds. Lots and lots of people, few drops, lots of time. Most raid targets take well over an hour to get to and clear, and most only drop 2-3 things. When you have a guild of over 100 people, which most large raiding guilds have, the loot per person is shitty. Add to that member turnover and having to gear up new people, and it's just not a lot of stuff coming in. When you're learning a new encounter, you can spend a week getting &lt; half the normal amount of loot as well. Raiding isn't some super loot generator. Mind you, the loot is much better than what comes out of LDoN, and is often even more of an upgrade per item.<br />
<br />
  I'd like to see better items on the LDoN merchants, more specifically non-visible slots. There's some ok rings and whatnot right now, but nothing that compares to Tak armor. I'd like LDoN to be a place where you can completely deck out a warrior given enough time. I would like a new tier of stuff in general, and I would definitely like 2 more ranks of difficulty, one between easy and hard, and another super hard one. Something to reward better players with more points.</div></div><hr />

comparing halls of testing trash mobs to the named that drop elemental mods is stupid sorry. velious is 4 or 5 expansions old now, maybe by the time the expansion  &quot;OMG you are still paying us to play this game?&quot; comes out elemental bosses will be 3 boxable, but not by OoW.<br />

<br />
Ive been in guild where 72 man raids were common, Ive also been in guilds where getting more than 3 clerics on was almost impossible. Larger guilds ensure you can raid every night and dont have to depend on a few key people to show up or no raid.  Sitting around doing nothing when i know there are raid targets up sucks. Sorry you dont understand that part.<br />
<br />
Nice example of time sinks. LDoN farming is less of a time sink how?<br />
<br />
ummm because its a time sink you  can still accomplish 100 pts an hour in with a marginal group vs needing 50 of yer buddies to show up and help out with and hope they all know their jobs and have good enuff gear to do the encounter. you can do normal ldons all day long with casters in velious era gear and have no problems-thats FIVE expansions of gear they are skipping using ldon and you think they should get even better?<br />
<br />
<br />
bottom line is to me it takes much less skill to win at ldons and rack up points than it does to fool an entire elemental guild into thinking you know how to play your class and arent an afk fucktard. besides if you want ele+ quality loot, outfit yerself in ldon gear then start working on getting GoD gear. Sure its all random drops but its hella nice stuff and cant be obtained with a random group of retards.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you are getting 100 points an hour, then sorry my friend, the content is trival for you. Which has the added side effect that the gear you would get wouldn't be an upgrade. The only skill large scale raids take is a high tolerance for tedium from long hours waiting on 1 or 2 people to realize that 60 other people are waiting on their stupid ass.<br />
<br />
And I'm still of the opinion that raiding brings gear faster tha LDoN for the amount of work put in and Ill continue to do so until someone shows me otherwise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">1 loot per month isn't that far off for raid guilds.  My guild raids 5 nights a week and since December 5th I have gotten 6 pieces of &quot;real&quot; loot.  I have a fair number of points banked and will probably pick up a couple more soon, but 1 per month is fairly close, maybe 2 per month for &quot;hardcore&quot; guilds but they are putting in more than 4 hours per night.  There are periods when you're in farm mode that it gets higher, but it's offset by zero loot periods while you're dying to new events, backflagging, etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's why they just have to scale it properly. Make it possible, but inefficient for crappy players to get the armor. Honestly, how much better does 1 piece of Elemental quality armor make you over a piece Tak armor? Not much at all. It's not until you start adding it all together that it makes a difference. If it takes a long long time at normal difficulty to get this armor, then by the time you could get enough of it to really make a difference in character strength, we're gonna be at the expansion past OoW and it really is gonna be equivalent to ToV armor. <br />
<br />
Then make the higher difficulties akin to GoD trials where you actually have to be paying attention and be on the ball, and make them worth a lot more points to where it is efficient and you could actually get a good amount of this armor in a reasonable amount of time. <br />
<br />
This gives everybody a chance and rewards those who put forth the effort.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>CyrzB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I really can't support EP Level gear on current LDoN missions.<br />
<br />
LDoN is, in my opinion, a great way for people to gear up to beat PoP mobs to get into EP. Remember the old debate, do you need Vex Thall to get to Elementals? The answer that seemed to come out of that most often was no, but it helps. <br />
<br />
Take a look at some of the VT gear, and compare it to the LDoN ones.<br />
<br />
Royal Attendant Bracer, for example, will easily give you far more HP, better stats, and better Vengeance for a bit of AC sacrifice compared to Umbracite Bracer from Vex Thall. <br />
<br />
LDoN already gives you gear where breaking into EP Themselves won't be all that hard.<br />
<br />
Yes, typically as expansions go, more and more people get access to the &quot;uber&quot; loot of the previous expansions. LDoN gear did this for PoP. GoD gear as well. OoW level increase will most certainly. Much like NToV and Ssra became small group encounters instead of raids with level 65 and new AA's, soon many PoP gods will be this way.<br />
<br />
I really, really can't see a good reason for adding better gear to LDoN raids. There are already people who have hardly poked their heads outside of LDoN, who finially are doing so to upgrade their gear in PoP and GoD. I kinda feel sorry for these people- there is so much more to EQ then the one expansion they play.<br />
<br />
I'm not advocating a total lack of LDoN, it is fun, and it is great for when you only have a breif time to play. But there is more out there then LDoN!<br />
<br />
At very least, lets take your numbers. I really do find it a bit hard to beleive the 4 hours for 100 points bit, it really can't take more then 90 miniutes for 50 points, plus a bit for getting a group. With no EP gear, I have no problem finishing most LDoNs in 30-40 miniutes.<br />
<br />
Oh, also... I spent about 6 months in a EP flagged guild, farming EP armour, without receiving a single peice of my own. Playing for longer then 4 hours. Why? Guild was overlarge, competition for EP Mobs is fierce, and even when we did get them, we didn't always win the fight, etc. Elemental Molds don't drop off of xp mobs, after all, they drop off mini's with long respawns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Fynepisa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">LDoN is, in my opinion, a great way for people to gear up to beat PoP mobs to get into EP. Remember the old debate, do you need Vex Thall to get to Elementals? The answer that seemed to come out of that most often was no, but it helps. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The thing is, according to the summit accounts that even talked adding this armor, the point of it is to give casual (non-raiding) players the ability to gear up more so you gotta look at it from a non-raiding perpective. The point is to give non-raiding players the ability to get elemental armor without ever seeing the elemental planes, not to help them break into Time. Sure raiding players can use it as filler equip, but the point is to give a completely alternate route without ever progressing through PoP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Celeritum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">You also have to remember that progression for casual players is very limited. There's no good reason that's not based on pride, why casual players shouldn't have access to gear similar to that a raiding player might attain. Why should half of the playerbase of a game be penalized for playing it the way they want?<br />
<br />
So what you can kill a god. Big deal. Do you have more fun killing Fennin Ro than I have taking time to enjoy trecking through an adventure? It's subjective isn't it? Subjectivity was built into this game. Everquest wasn't set up to be 100% mandetory raiding or 100% mandetory casual. It can be played either way, or a hybrid of both ways. Should the reward for playing the game one way be less fulfilling than the reward for playing the game another way? Should things such as available playtime, preference of character, preference of playstyle, limit gameplay?<br />
<br />
You can put 6 - 8 hours into 1 entire Plane of Time clearing, once you're familiar with the strategies and are capable of just hammering it out. That will yield 3 loots from every major god. That's 24 loots right there. Plus another 3 guarenteed, 4 possible, from quarm. Maximum that's 28 loots. Then you have another 1 loot from every phase 1 trial, so that's another 5 loots, bringing it to a total count of 31 loots. Then you've got phase 2, another 5 loots, so we're up to 36loots. Factor in the 2 end bosses of phase 3, is it 1 or 2 drops / kill from them? Since I'm not entirely sure, lets use the minimum and say 1 drop from each, for a minimum total of 38loots, and then you can have the random loots off the boss mobs for each wave of mobs before the Avatar of Elements etc. So lets say you have a very crappy night and say 42 loots total on 1 night in Plane of Time. Let's take the middle ground of 6-8 hours and say 7, then that's about 6 loots/hour for 1 plane of time clearing.<br />
<br />
Now compare that to the amount of loot you can get from a 6-8 hour gaming period of ldon missions. Keep in mind the quality of the loot you will be getting in plane of time is superior to that of the loot you can get in Ldon, and that at bare minimum as long as you do in fact clear Time, you will have guarenteed at least 27 loots from gods alone, whereas nameds are not guarenteed spawns in Ldons.<br />
<br />
When you consider all that, can you really say the end path of a raiding player is equally as fulfilling as that of a casual player?<br />
<br />
Fine, you might say that Plane of Time is 1 given example, and that in other zones loot will not be as pleantiful. Fine, show me the 1 given example that cooresponds to casual gaming.</div></div><hr />

comparing halls of testing trash mobs to the named that drop elemental mods is stupid sorry. velious is 4 or 5 expansions old now, maybe by the time the expansion  &quot;OMG you are still paying us to play this game?&quot; comes out elemental bosses will be 3 boxable, but not by OoW.<br />
<br />
Lvl. 70 toons, a whack of new items and AA ... seeing this stuff 3 boxed at that point won't surprise me at all.  As somebody points out, PoP will be a few expansions old by then.  For my money, the *OMG you are still paying us ...* expansion has already been released, but that's me. ;)<br />
<br />
And ... (funny how the math keeps coming back) *90 miniutes for 50 points, plus a bit for getting a group* x 2 = 100 points in roughly 4 hours, FWIW.  And that's a fairly typical rate, for peeps who do know the game well yet go LFG with one our two of their remaining guildies and chums to do a dungeon.  Finding a group - without being too selective - can take 5 minutes, or it can take an hour, depending on your available classes and schedule.  It's quicker if the majority of your /friends still play, perhaps.  Frankly, if you can't see any worth in upgrading the loot tables or vendor lists in LDoN, you probably don't need the upgrades enough for it to affect you, anyway.<br />
<br />
LDoN may be a great way to gear up for EP - but most of the peeps playing LDoN on a regular basis aren't getting into EP and aren't expecting to, and so that's irrelevant to them.  If I'd been planning on getting into EP, I'd have farmed the plat for Ornate and gotten on with it, it would've been quicker.  There are people who spend a tonne of time digging up new encounters they haven't seen, and exploring the game and playing a whole lot of it outside of LDoN, and still rely on LDoN for much of their gameplay and upgrades the way things are today.  <br />
<br />
Funnelling the player base into a narrowing gameplay style for significant upgrades is not going to work, not for most players aesthetically, and not fiscally for SOE.  If the non-raider feels left out of the picture, she or he will move on.  There's a lot of gaming outside of EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">My guild is in the elementals, pre-god kills. On a raiding night where we are keeping a good pace, we average 1 raid kill an hour. Some nights we are slower, and rarely we are faster. The average amount of loot per kill is 2 items (some mobs drop 1 item, and rarely we kill a mob who drops 3 items). We have an average of 42 people in attendance. That is 2 items/42 people/hour.<br />
 <br />
If those 42 people divided in to 7 groups and did hard LDONs instead, what would they earn? The average time spent per hard mission is about 1 hour for my guild's groups (this includes setup time). Total number of points earned by 42 players is 4410 per hour. That is 3 pieces of 1492-point LDON gear earned per hour. So through LDON we'd earn 3 items/42 people/hour.<br />
 <br />
I am ignoring secondary dropped items that might have been found in LDON. That is fair, because the raid might get have gotten 1-2 secondary dropped items too (e.g. PoAir mini-mini's always drop one). I'll suggest that the quality and quantity of those secondary items would be the same either way, so they cancel out.<br />
 <br />
So overall, the individual player is left with 2/42 elemental quality items per hour, versus 3/42 LDON quality items per hour. If a casual player is 2/3 as efficient as my guildmates, then the casual player is getting the exact same rate of item acquisition as I do by raiding.</div></div><hr />

[\quote]<br />
<br />
100 points an hour is 2 easy or 1 hard. I do ldon for points, i never count on drops in hard to get gear since my relationship with the RNG is shitty and the drops in normals are strictly cash/tribute loot..  a good group that doesnt have the puller/cc for a hard can do 2 easies in 1 hour, if you finish too fast it forces you to wait to get another adv. Im very picky about who i do hard with becasue every group i felt was marginal for hard that i ageed to try with failed, usually by 1. If you take the full 1.5 hours on either setting, your group either didnt have the dps or had too many deaths. and if you think raiding takes no skill then whatever YOU are raiding sir is trivial.<br />

  Well that's the key. People ARE leaving it. If the casual players leave, which SOE claims is the majority, then first they'll have to consolidate servers. They would also make less content due to the incredible loss of income. They will have to lay off developers and designers. There CS will suffer even more. If they don't change things, the trend will be for WoW and EQ2 will gut EQ totally, even if they don't cater towards power gamers. EQ as you know it will die. Now, that might sound doom and gloom, but if they don't maintain a wide appeal it will come true. YOU will suffer for unhappy casual gamers; this is your problem too.</div></div><hr />

Naw, not really. First of all, it shouldn't take 90 miniutes to finish a LDoN. I'm not speaking as a Time Geared Warrior here, I'm speaking as a pre-elemental geared warrior.<br />

And yeah, it's usually a good idea to keep your friends list up to date, maybe start or join a social chat channel and invite people you get along with into it. Soon you have a network of friends and people you know that you can draw on to get groups, etc. Or, failing that, /w all 62 65 lfg works great if you are a prime time player, and in my experiance, works well even at 3am EST (I work nights).<br />

I guess my question now is... if you are not using LDoN raids as a stepping stone, why do you want EP Quality Items? Last night a quote from my pickup LDoN raids was &quot;5k is enough hp for a tank in normal ldon, easy&quot;, and I rather agree with it. And once you use the normal LDoN's for stuff you can pick up in Miraguls (Or, like many people say, explore the world a bit, pick up some Skyshrine armour) that will get you started in Hard, Takish will finish it off for you.<br />

The idea is that they actually add more single group content where your gear won't cut it. Heck it already exists in the GoD trials. Make more 1-2 group content that makes the Ikkinz trials look like cake. <br />
<br />
This doesn't have to ruin the game since instanced zones prevent people who aren't supposed to be there from simpy bringing more people. They now have the ability to actually make content targetted at a specific demographic where you can't just cheat it by bringing more people. I don't see why you would want to throw all the time you've put into EQ and simply move to EQ2 when they have everything in the game already to facilitate both styles of play.</div></div><hr />

There is a corresponding low time for raiders though.  A lot of encounters take many nights of failing just to get that first peice of loot.  Doing a round of backflags can take a couple weeks of raiding for basically twink loot or subpar stuff that will be replaced very soon (with a couple notable exceptions), and in a &quot;farm zone&quot; like Time you will get the same loot over and over and eventually the lower stuff will start to rot but you continue to farm for quarm loot.  Also, most guilds only do Time one night a week after it reaches farm status, and spend the rest of their week dying in GoD and getting no loot until they reach this expansion's ToV/Vex Thal/Plane of Time zone.</div></div><hr />

I didn't miss anything. I AM doing GoD content. My whole group is in LDoN gear, and now KT/Ikkinz gear.  I don't know anyone who is as well equipped as my crew that doesn't raid. I am the same one who told you to keep on when others were saying you couldn't do the sewers. Just because you are happy with GoD sewers being the end of the road doesn't mean it has to be that way. <br />
<br />
<br />
As for guilds going through dry times, so do single groups. Just like Time where every loot that drops starts out great and after time it mostly rots, so does LDoN hard loot for the casual player trying to get that one drop. As for raiding competition causing dry spells, I don't think it is fair to compare instanced zones to non-instanced zones. I don't know anyone who didn't beat Uqua because they lost the race to Barxt to another guild. Farming stuff like elementals is comparable to wing named in BoT where instanced single group content needs to be compared to instanced raid content.</div></div><hr />

  Maybe you're missing the point. If EQ makes less money, then they will spend less money on EQ because it's less profitable. WHY WOULD THEY CONTINUE FUNDING A PROJECT THAT IS SUDDENLY LOSING THE MAJORITY OF THEIR PLAYER BASE? SOE is a business. They will improve EQ less when EQ makes less money. Do you understand? It doesn't matter what made money in the past. The ideology of raiding isn't going to keep EQ funded, IF EQ doesn't have enough paying accounts. They're NOT going to take money from EQ2 to pay for EQ1.<br />
<br />
  That being said, how is adding better armor on LDoN merchants going to hurt your dumb ass? How do you think you have any right to say what a casual player wants or needs or what's good for them? You make these claims about how &quot;i dont see why folks are complaining about the quality of the ldon gear, its sweet gear. there isnt a mob out there (barring time and god bosse)you cant tank outfitted in full LDON gear. if you really think a casual player needs better than that you are just fucking nuts&quot;, when you're not a casual player at all. <br />

<br />
  Are you entirely stupid or just mostly stupid? People with different play styles are asking for different rewards gotten in entirely different ways. People who pay as much money as you do. If those people leave, it matters as much as if you left. If the majority of porsche buyers suddenly stopped buying porsches, there aren't any more porsches made. If most people stop going to college because they realize they're wasting their time and money, the colleges will drop in quality and close. This isn't a whine, this is a fact. Deal with it. You wanting no improvements for the majority playerbase will screw YOU in the end. Make suggestions that would make them happy, or you lose out.</div></div><hr />

I agree that the system in place works fine for the zones that are in place, but with new content comes new challenges. I'm simply arguing that when this new content comes that giving casual players more options and higher quality armor sets is a good thing.

You are basically asking for better rewards from the exact same encounter. Even if the price was high enough that it would seem difficult, it would be the same as adding Elemental Molds to PoV xp mobs, just making them very rare drops.<br />

<br />
Your second suggestion is on track with what I would like to see. I don't care if it is LDoN style, GoD trial style, new style, etc. I simply like the idea of broadening the progression path for non-raiding players. I think what they did with the point system for LDoN was perfect for it's purpose so I think some sort of point based armor would be a good idea. I'm totally okay with it being a new set of points that can only be obtained through harder dungeons (although I still feel it can be done to a similar effect by simply scaling the points enough that normal adventures would be way too inefficient).  Ultimately I would like to see a non-raiding path that was somehow as difficult as the raiding path that offered approximately 80% the rewards. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
On a side note, I don't think EP level armor should be considered so sacred anymore. You can upgrade just about every slot once you get to Time and then again in Qvic and probably again in Tacvi. I can only assume on Tacvi so I'll leave it out for now, but with what has been found it's really a 3rd tier armor set.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>CyrzB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">That's really not massively different from previous expansions. You could upgrade NToV with Ssra, and again in Vex Thall. You can upgrade Vex Thall with some early god drops, EP, and again with later gods/time.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying that &quot;No, casual people cannot have EP quality loot&quot;. I'm saying &quot;LDoN does not currently require EP Loot, and does not currently merit such&quot;.<br />
<br />
I think perhaps, for this expansion at least, the idea of the small group getting decent loot was addressed, however, with the level balancing idea turning out how it did, people are still too put off to go there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Naw, not really. First of all, it shouldn't take 90 miniutes to finish a LDoN. I'm not speaking as a Time Geared Warrior here, I'm speaking as a pre-elemental geared warrior.<br />
<br />
And yeah, it's usually a good idea to keep your friends list up to date, maybe start or join a social chat channel and invite people you get along with into it. Soon you have a network of friends and people you know that you can draw on to get groups, etc. Or, failing that, /w all 62 65 lfg works great if you are a prime time player, and in my experiance, works well even at 3am EST (I work nights).<br />
<br />
I guess my question now is... if you are not using LDoN raids as a stepping stone, why do you want EP Quality Items? Last night a quote from my pickup LDoN raids was &quot;5k is enough hp for a tank in normal ldon, easy&quot;, and I rather agree with it. And once you use the normal LDoN's for stuff you can pick up in Miraguls (Or, like many people say, explore the world a bit, pick up some Skyshrine armour) that will get you started in Hard, Takish will finish it off for you.<br />
<br />
At first I thought you wanted better LDoN equipment to go to GoD, etc.<br />
<br />
And yes, there is stuff in LDoN I would wear. I'm coming up on 7k unbuffed, and most of my gear comes from places that could be taken with very small raids or even groups now.<br />
<br />
Don't assume I want anything - I haven't written that I do, I've written ways that I think the game could have been made better for me and for people like me.  What do I want?  Nuffin`, I quit.  I'm not asking for anything, I'm just chipping in my two cents.  Upgrades are meaningless without a sense of progression (5K is more than enogh for LDoN normal, 4K was pretty cozy), and I am not interested in rebuilding my contact network in-game for the third or fifth time.  <br />
<br />
Many of 'em have left the game, some are raiding for their upgrades and doing nicely, and a bunch of the rest of us are doing other things.  (Use LDoN raids as a stepping stone?  We can't draw 24 people out anymore, let alone 36.)  I'd rather be enjoying my time than trying to shmooze online so that I might enjoy my time.  And, eh ... I don't to be reminded for the 11tieth time about commands such as /w all, either - not with so many of the peeps in EQ being of the *special fun* variety.  But thanks for the heads up. <br />
<br />
At any rate, I am quit, the treadmill slipped a gear and I got sick of stumbling in place.  For the sections of GoD open to me, LDoN quality upgrades wouldn't have made much difference.  GoD was fun, cajoling people to go wasn't.  The new *temporary* zones, and zone revamps were amazing, too - and an easier sell.  But the novelty was fleeting, and the upgrades and progression scant.<br />
<br />
The 90 minutes reference was me quoting you (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showpost.php?p=113435&amp;postcount=22), and so if I got the source material wrong, *whups*, but I thought I read it right.  It's still about standard for able yet casual players, and if you've missed all the posts spelling that out, you will not notice one more.  And if you've read em, you won't believe another, anyway.  A 7K tank should be able wade through LDoN normal in no time, whereas a 5K tank is more than needed to get the job done.   Heck, I've grouped with an early-EP pre-time chanter, and it cuts the mission time by more than half.<br />
<br />
I don't know how your gameplay is, or the groups you can find with your time, but I know how it works for me and where it failed.  And I'm not enough of a fool or enough of an asshole to try to tell you how your game works for you.  I just post how the game worked for me.  I find game mechanics inneresting.<br />
<br />
I don't see a reward for LDoN timesink system as being any more or less meritorious than plat farming for bazaar upgrades or raiding.  I've done em all, and raiding is the most inattentive activity I found in EQ, whether or not I was MT.  My best rewards came outta raids, tho.  Comparing the LDoN merchant list to PoV or other tier 2 loot tables is specious, IMO, but if that works for you that's a fine thing.<br />
<br />
Sassinak's example (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showpost.php?p=113456&amp;postcount=26) is interesting, yet it completely ignores the non-EP, non-raiding LDoN player, who don't have any EQ quality gear, don't have a ready guild to form quick groups with, and don't do LDoN hard in an hour.  I think it's a little myopic - if it isn't deliberately limited in scope. Most posters here who try to guesstimate how the game works for other players or groups seem to be blinkered.  I suppose the numbers fit for a group up to the 7K tank level, but they ain't the ones trying to get up towards the 7K level anymore.  I liked the breakdown as a thought experiment, tho.  (Guesstimating, I'd say that the average LDoN normal group was 1/6 as efficient as you post that your guild groups are in LDoN hard.)<br />
<br />
To me, it's an apples and oranges comparison and there aren't enough points of correlation for a direct comparison to have any meaning.  But I think it'd be more like asking for single groupable access (laborious, difficult, annoying and time sinkish to protect all the e-penises laying about the place) to the EP zones where the items drop, than to move the drops.  Exploring and playing the other expansions open to our wee guild got a bit *vanilla*, but we did a lot of it and enjoyed a number of the encounters a few times.  We got a lot of upgrades for various members, too.  We were few, but smart and tightly knit.  Those of us who left to join raiding guilds quickly got massive upgrades, then plateaued and are doing well, the last I heard.  Most of the rest of us have moved on.<br />
<br />
I would have really, really liked to see some progression built into LDoN that would have eventually allowed one to purchase and augment gear that would come near in quality to EP drops, or any feeling of progression at all for that matter.  Fynepsia spells it out really well.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>czai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">I suggested a few things:<br />
<br />
1) 10 person to 2 group LDoN &quot;raid missions&quot; where the content is ramped up and meant for more people.  Each raid mission garners you 200 points on a seperate points system meant for seperate merchants that sell better quality stuff.<br />
<br />
2) BoTB, a raid-only zone designed for 3-5 groups.  Mobs have the ability to drop ornate version 2.0, NODROP armor molds that are between ornate and EP in quality.    Add a few static nameds with a hard to track spawntime so that uber_group_03 can't zone in and camp it when it's due.... say 2 days +/- 2 days.<br />
<br />
3) 1 or 2 groupable 'trials' you can do that alternatively (but fully)  flag you up to but not past the equivalent of Mith Marr and Bertox.  Would get rid of some backflagging and would make it possible for the enterprising guildless player to get some progression done instead of sitting on their ass waiting for a raid to zerg Terris Thule for the nth time.<br />
<br />
Like it or not, casuals and non-raiders NEED a way to further their character besides the limited ways they already have:<br />
<br />
1) Levels / AA's<br />
2) An extremely limited scope of bazaar-buyable gear<br />
3) LDoN<br />
4) GoD trials (to some extent)<br />
<br />
I don't look at casuals and non-raiders crying to be given gear, on the contrary I think what they're looking for is a path to this gear that they can travel their own way, on their own time, and it's not only gear, but progression.  They don't want to work less than raiders do, but the option needs to be there, in some form.<br />
<br />
As an aside note, as a fairly hardcore raider I went over 4 months without getting loot during a raid.  It was earlier this year.  Don't feed me bullshit about how I can &quot;afk&quot; half the time on raids and still get 24+ pieces of loot per night, and I won't feed you bullshit about how you can get a full set of ornate in 1 night by camp-jumping and KSing in BoT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>CyrzB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Ah... my apologies, then, it seemed to me that this thread had turned into a discussion about putting EP Quality drops into the LDoN Merchant Table, and I had thought you were in favor of it.<br />
<br />
The 90 miniute arguement was, without me scrolling back, originally put forward by, I beleive, CrystalMatrix, and it was actually &quot;4-5 hours for 2 normal LDoN's&quot;. While I can beleive that some days it may take that long, I do find it hard to beleive that's a normal time. That's taking the full 90 miniutes each time, and either taking a hour to form the first group, or being unable to keep most of the first group for a 2nd run, plus I guess taking half an hour to buff each adventure. <br />
<br />
And when you do do a /w all, you aren't absolutely floored by how often you see at least one, and often several, groups lfg, and no one organizing them? It happens to me so often that I almost wonder if I could start charging for the service! These experiances have lead me to beleive that most people ignore the /w all lfg, especially if it regularly requires an hour to form a LDoN group. Unless, of course, you are out of your servers normal prime time.<br />
<br />
So, yes, I do have a hard time swallowing the 5 hours for 2 adventures timeline of events.<br />
<br />
Hmmm... I'm not sure you saw my posts where I said I would be in favor of &quot;Harder LDoN-Type encounters&quot; with &quot;EP Level Rewards&quot;. I think we are saying similiar things here, since you said &quot;Single Group Access... to the zones EP Items Drop&quot;. Heck, we're going one better here, since I can't imagine any single group dropping EP Mold mobs on a regular basis... much less any group that could use the upgrade. Have you looked at what drops EP Molds? It's not xp trash.<br />
<br />
Choosing some from fire, because they require the least clearing (You could probably pull some of these without clearing a single other mob) you have Blaxxax the Omnifiend, who hits for over 3k and has a 2k AE. You have Babnoxius, I forget her max hit, but has a 500hp and 125 mana/tick AE DoT. You have General Rapeme, I mean, Reparm, who melee's for 3k and procs for 3k- He can one round most tanks in game if he gets lucky.<br />
<br />
I'm just saying the &quot;One Group&quot; content that provides access to EP level gear needs to be harder then the current LDoN content.<br />
<br />
I don't mean this as a personal attack, but assuming your gear link (I don't know what alla calls their version of magelo) is accurate, it looks to me as if you have plenty of gear progression left in even with the current vendor lists. Miraguls has some nice upgrades for you, Takish has better if you don't mind waiting a bit longer for it. Or you are perfectly capable, IMO, of taking 2 or even 1 group of good players to Halls of Testing in ToV to upgrade that champions, if you need a change of scenery. Or even taking a group to Bastion of Thunder and pick up some Ornate. Once you pick up some of that, look at the bottom level of Ssra, I often go on Rhag1 or Rhag2 single group to two group pickup raids, mostly because some of the friends I have in EQ still benefit from that content. And again, you said you cannot field a group of 24, you did not say you could field of group of 12 or even 6, I don't mean to assume, but much of lasts years &quot;raid&quot; content is this years &quot;group&quot;, and the loot is still the same.<br />
<br />
And I know you find large raids boring, like you can AFK till the loot part is done. I've even been on raids like that, I much prefer the smaller strikes where you leave the ones who could AFK behind and take only those who pay attention, and I think you'll find single grouping these encounters does require most people to at least glance at their screen.<br />
<br />
<br />
Here is a question... Again, not meant for a personal attack, but of the two people who have been most outspoken for the EP Items to LDoN Vendors, at least tonight, both have had several slots they can upgrade with the current vendor list. Are there people who are out there, who love the LDoN experiance and who find raiding boring, who have say, a full or nearly full set of Takish and are actively looking for upgrades, who find GoD does not currently solve this need?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Doggabone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">arf arf<br />
<br />
I think it's more generally a chat about *how do we keep the non-raider progressing*?<br />
<br />
For me, the trouble with Tak (and other spots) was finding people to go with.  I'm within about 200 points of unlocking Tak armour IIRC, and if I kept slogging thru the maps I'd eventually have a complete set.  I wouldn't do Miragul's with Tak avail., it just seemed ridickerous to blow the points that way. Tak and Guk were the main targets for our house (druid and myself, she wanted the leather there and I liked Guk maps the best). Getting peeps to join me in Tak was a pain, most nights, nobody liked pulling there.  DX9, and getting locked inside doors often, was the icing on the cake.   Even as we added one to our circle who could play well and had some drive, we would lose one or two to general game attrition, or they'd move on to bigger and better things.<br />
<br />
It started to feel pointless to even continue, as we grew to realise we were not going to progress the toons with our current chums and already had enough gear to do the job before us.  I had a lot of slots I was looking forward to upgrading, but I was enjoying replaying Thief more than EQ when CoH came out, and now we're having more fun with that.  Our accounts are cancelled and we're letting them fizzle out while we go on hiatus.  We both feel quit, tho people change their minds about such stuff, and we know we may do so in six months as well.<br />
<br />
We play about 5 or 6 hours a night here, and we usually got two wins in in a night, sometimes 3 if the group was cooking.  But if yer were referencing a quote, then that's how I missed yer meaning, as I read it to be your assumption of a typical group.  No matter, 4 hrs. for two wins was how I scheduled my time and it was usually close to that.  I don't find it hard to believe, I got to live it for several months. ;)  Many others did breeze through, and every so often we got to be among them.  But not most nights. <br />
<br />
*That's taking the full 90 miniutes each time, and either taking a hour to form the first group, or being unable to keep most of the first group for a 2nd run, plus I guess taking half an hour to buff each adventure.*<br />
<br />
Not the full 90 minutes, every time, but oy vey a whole lotta the time some times and more often'n not rebuilding the group for the second run.  A very typical night, random pick-up groups can be very slow moving and I ran out of stomach to put them together.  Some were a blast, but we increasingly tripped over peeps who were min/maxing and we didn't enjoy playing with 'em anymore than the jackanapes whom I suspect had me on auto-follow while they drooled over pr0n pics they were downloading.  <br />
<br />
Not only was I struck by how many groups were out there looking to be combined, but often I was floored by how many of those peeps weren't willing to group with class X, or do thing Y, as though waiting for the ideal arrangment was better than getting off the duff (figuratively) and doing sump'n.  We spent a lot of time spamming /w all and hammering the LFG tool.  Playing our alts did little to revive our flagging enthusiasm.<br />
<br />
As far as putting EP level gear on LDoN merchants, or the components to build it, I am not so much for it or against it as I have taken to harping that LDoN isn't as quick and simple for many of the players out there as some think, and that if it were on the table, it would take a long time to get to for the typical non-raid level toon.  Cuz if yer not raiding, you run out of zones to progress to, you just keep tweaking your gear.  (And that's what killed the game for me.)  <br />
<br />
I don't have a problem with it, tho, and I know if a higher level of armour pieces shows up it'll be prohibitively dear, and only approaching EP levels fully auged (and so, even more points).  Even one notch up the scale from Tak would be something a lot of non-raiders could get behind, mebbe between EP and Ornate.  Gear up in Miragul's, aug it, start working hards for ... Ruj? Or wherever the next stuff showed up.<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure my Alla profile is up to date - looks right to me (but that's not my full gear, I see the Incarnadine BP is on and I've got the WMBS in hand).  But it's pretty close.  Thanks for the upgrade suggestions, they're fun zones to go to and I've enjoyed them, tho if I'd been able to to hit HoT as much as I wanted to I'd have some of that gear on. ;) 1 or 2 groups was doable for Trollbraggers last time I checked, if the timing is just right.  If I understand correctly that SOE be thinking about fielding 18 man LDoN raids, that should go a long way for the family/small guild players.  <br />
<br />
Small raids with my guild could be fun - some of the LoY events are a little trickier than a typical *bottom feeders smack-down* or a *army of mighty ants zergathon*, and we were often able to get folx on for those nights.  I've seen a Reparm raid, watching at a friend's computer (I was driving his monk while he fetched beer or cooked the steaks or some such).  I enjoyed raiding Vindi and the PoI dragon a whole lot more.<br />
<br />
I like czai's ideas very much.  I don't like flagging, I like the *zone in and die till you learn that you don't belong here* approach to limiting progression, but those proposals are a good and viable alternative.   Flagging, to me, is getting cockblocked by the game provider.<br />
<br />
As to yer question, I dunno.  GoD drops sure looked good to me, some of 'em, but pulling people there was like pulling my own teeth with a pair of pliers, and I wasn't going there with strangers.  If I'd been fully decked out in Tak, I didn't see a whole lot available that would have been a significant upgrade, but that's right about when I stopped looking into such stuff.</div></div><hr />

gearwise you have a looooong way to go before you need to start wondering why you cant buy elemental quality loot off a vendor, tehre are a lot of upgrades out there already you could have that dont involve anything more than the bazaar and your willingness to farm pp.<br />
<br />
i think the nail was hit on the head when cyr said that asking for elemental quality loot to be purchaseable from existing ldon adventures is akin to asking that they drop rarely in POV, its the same difficulty. hell, POV is harder, mobs there have procs.<br />
<br />
i guess basically it would piss me off greatly if i had to deal with the self memblurring mobs in POA (god they killed my necro so many times) and shit like that to get elemental level gear and some schmuck just had to wade thru a ton of normal ldons while he watched porn on tv to get it<br />
<br />
GoD already offers comparable gear to EP and its obtainable by a single group, but only by single groups that have already progressed to the point just before GoD lvl gear. It looks from here that all people want to do is skip progression. Cyr was right in asking if anyone that has actually beaten ldon has a complaint. Wait, they arent bitching about ldon because they are grouping in god after doing 700+ ldons? oh gee, i see, looks like that progression thing might be worth looking into<br />
<br />
im sick of the playstle argument too, we both play the same amount of money to play, that is correct, you know what we pay for? the ability to log into an eq server when we want and play for as long as we want. it doesnt guarantee any loot, any fun, and not a thing except they will have servers for you to play on. if you choose to log in 5 hours a week or a night or whatever and i choose to log in for 10 hours a night then whose fault is it we dont have the same level of gear? If you know the road you choose leads to boston, why do you still take it and complain it doesnt go to detroit when you get to the end?</div></div><hr />

EP molds do not drop like ornate. EP molds are raid loot, period. 40+ people. If there was single-group access to the EPs, you would still never get a piece of EP armor, unless you were willing to raid. There are three kinds of gear in the EPs:<br />
 <br />
1) single group rare mobs - these are like BOT tower bosses, and the loot is equivalent to LDON Hard drops (generally 85 hp)<br />
 <br />
2) mini raid mobs - these are like killing Grummus or Aerin'Dar and require similar numbers. Their loot is similar to VT loot. (generally 110-125 hp)<br />
 <br />
3) raid mobs - these drop the molds and other gear that you think of as &quot;EP loot&quot; (generally 130-150 hp). None of them are doable with less than 40 people unless you're already well geared. Some need over 50 people at first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">Raiding is inattentive??<br />
<br />
Erm... maybe we don't play the same game.Raiding for most of the people I know in my guild takes a lot out of them.We are umm er mostly a little older ,but, omg 75 pct of the guild needs a nap/break after we're done raiding.It's just not in the same boat as a grind group.Heck after raids I xp in fire or play in god to relax and wind down.Even playing in Tipt or hard ldon is relaxing by far in comparison for me.Your raid experience sounds totally differant and unsatisfying.<br />
<br />
I don't have the answers.I really disliked the idea that i had to network to succeed in a game when I started to learn about EQ though.Ironically,I really started to enjoy grouping and raiding when I buried that whole idea.I group with people because I like them or feel like meeting new people,otherwise I don't group.I raid with my guild because friends brought me in and I enjoy the company of our members and love to  accomplish stuff with them.To be honest if I only played with these people to get upgrades I'd have quit long ago.Raiding would be way too much work for me if I didnt enjoy the challenges with my guild.Raiding involves alot of work,time and patience.It's certainly more demanding than running around in ldon and if it's not then sorry you're doing something wrong on raids imho.The effort and time pay off with rewards you just cant get cruising around ldon.<br />
<br />
EQ is a social game.Two are stronger than one, a group is greater than two and a raid force even better.That raid force is a challenge to motivate and coordinate compared to a couple friends ,however.<br />
<br />
I don't want to sound like a jerk.My wife and I got really lucky with our guild of casual raiders.We're seeing stuff i never thought to and I get to tank a lot of cool mobs.Before this though, I was happy exploring stuff with my wife and occaisonally friends.I hope they add a lot of content for smaller groups and raids.However,that content shouldn't yield similiar rewards to raid targets .It just wouldn't make sense and would trivialize the efforts of raiders gone before.<br />
<br />
 Being strong for your small circle in eq is all that matters as a warrior.I feel just as good tanking for my friends as any warrior in Time.It was the same for me in velious.However, raiding is a big part of the game and it can be especially fun has a warrior I think.I'd bet a lot of disgruntled warriors here could have a great time going back to raiding in the right spirit of things.There are many warriors on this board who don't raid atm that know far more about tanking than I did not too long ago.I'm sure many of them could find a way to make it fun again.<br />
<br />
Erm, lack of sleep has me waxing stupid again.I don't mean to offend anyone,but, there's many ways to raid in eq and for a tank  the big mobs(big being relative hehe) are half the game.Sleep time.</div></div><hr />

wanting siongle group content for loot that compares to the current 60 man raid target loot is ignorant at best and just plain greedy and lazy at worst.<br />
<br />
If you think high end raiding involved a lot of sitting around afk and shot you are a fool or have been in shitty guilds. Most guilds wont put up with leeches and instead reward those who actually contribute. Aside from that, if all these raiders are autofollowing afk and shit, who exactly is killing these elemental mobs? afk folks dont do a lot of dps, healing, or tanking last  time i checked.<br />
<br />
I cant offer you an alternative other than change to eq2, sony has said they want eq1 geared to the raiding crowd.  you refuse to see the raiders side of it, we put in many many more hours than most casual players. not only do we have to get the lvls, aa, and the gear to get into a good guild, we then die a lot more than a reg player trying to learn new encounters, etc and have to make up that xp, plus grind out more aa's. yer damn right i think the raider deserves better rewards.  If a casual player puts in the TIME, he can get fully ldon geared and be comparable to an elemental player who has put in an equal or maybe even MORE TIME<br />
<br />
we can go back to the college comparison. we both pay the same tuition, but i take classes in physics, calculus, trig, etc and you take classes in basketweaving and bowling. One of us is going to graduate with a degree worht a lot more than the other. and guess what...ITS NOT THE COLLEGES FAULT YOU FUCKING MORON.

  Please, find that quote for me. Show me where SOE stated that EQ was only for raiding and EQ2 was only for casual. Do that, and I'll stop pressing you to help fix EQ instead of whining about how focusing on how changing the non-raid system is stupid. <br />
<br />
  You do realize that's all your posts are doing, right? Stupid this, stupid that. You're dumb if you want non-raiders to get anything. YOU ARE NOT BEING CONSTRUCTIVE. If you get your way, EQ as you know it will end. <br />
<br />
  Btw, guess what? Look at my magelo. I've done the raiding thing. That is indeed an EP helm I have, and a BoW. That's VT loots, the biggest straight time sink extent in EQ. I've put in the time. I spent most of 52-65 + 250 AAs getting my emp key, VT key, and flagged through PoP almost to Time. I'm quite qualified to make commentaries on raiding if I damn well please. If I afk in a raid, someone else tanks the mobs. If I afk in my group, they sit and wait for me to come back. If I'm not feeling well on raid, I sit back and offtank or do DPS. If I'm not feeling well in a group, the group does poorly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No its not.  You are just being abrasive and judgmental (you ask alot of personal questions about magelo's/&quot;why havent you&quot; etc w/o prompting...be careful you open the same types of personal questions to be asked of yourself and your habits) and it detracts from your constructive purpose.<br />
<br />
I think you'd be accurate to say &quot; wanting elemental loot that compartes to 60 man loot is wrong IF it is awarded based on current LDoN risk/reward&quot;.  Create a couple more tiers of LDoN additional harder difficulty, restructure what points can be used to buy it and you have a solid alternative path.<br />
<br />
As it stands the current LDoN structure doesnt support that, so underneath the bluster I think you have a point.  Try to stick to it.<br />
<br />
 If you get your way, EQ as you know it will end. <br />
<br />
Based on the population demopgraphics raised by raaj in his report I'm inclined to agree.  However, I think both market segments need complimentary paths to let the game suceed.  And btw if you are sanctimonious about the merits of &quot;big raid&quot; vs &quot;single group&quot; I can tell you that real life has a way of making you switch back and forth between the camps over a span of years.  Be careful of how arrogantly you push your position for you may find yourself in the other camp at some point (it has happened to myself in 5+ years a couple times).</div></div><hr />

I would like to see a SLIGHT increase in the quality of the non-visible slot armor on ldon merchants however since most of them are kinda weak. The addition of class specific ldon items is interesting as well and would allow for nicer armor tuned to the class for about the same points cost.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Fynepisa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">Here is a question... Again, not meant for a personal attack, but of the two people who have been most outspoken for the EP Items to LDoN Vendors, at least tonight, both have had several slots they can upgrade with the current vendor list. Are there people who are out there, who love the LDoN experiance and who find raiding boring, who have say, a full or nearly full set of Takish and are actively looking for upgrades, who find GoD does not currently solve this need?<br />
<br />
First, here is the links to the characters I did most of my LDoNs with:<br />
<br />
Rogue - http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=20720<br />
Cleric - http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=770298<br />
<br />
As you can see, nearly every slot is either a LDoN vendor purcahsed, hard dropped, or there was a comparable droppable piece so it wasn't worth spending points on.<br />
<br />
I loved LDoN for a while, but as you do more and more adventures you just want to pull your hair out. I think the concept of points as well as nice drops from hards was perfect. They simply just needed to make more variety of stuff to do. If you actaully wanted to gear up beyond just getting a Tak BP and a pair of anger augs, it was just way too repetitive. <br />
<br />
As for GoD, I have loved the single group stuff here as well. It's challenging and rewarding. However, it is very limited and annoying that every drop goes in the same 4 slots (ears, fingers, range, wrists). There are no good visible slot items and no weapons. Besides rangers (stonewood bows), non-raiding melee are stuck at velious/luclin level weaponly where raiding weapons have taken off to completely new levels. <br />
<br />
Maybe in the devs eyes, the non-raiding player was supposed to get visible armor and weapon upgrades in LDoN and then get the non-visible slots from GoD, but since my group was compeltely done with LDoN before GoD even came out, it just feels slightly lacking without any visible armor and weapon upgrades.<br />
<br />
I don't ever want or expect current raid level items, but what I would like is to have enough itemezied content aimed towards dedicated non-raiding players to always be a few steps behind the equally dedicated raiding player.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>CyrzB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">Thank you, Fynepisa, I'm still pulling up the Magelo, but I think you are exactly the person who we need to speak to.

<br />
What do you feel about adding, say. a new wayfarers camp. Points from old do not carry over. Difficulty is such that you must be able to do current Hard LDoN's fairly easiely, but you have similiar quality to EP Loot on the merchants?</div></div><hr />

Y'all are focussing more on gear than I ever did.

<br />
Don't feed me bullshit about how I can &quot;afk&quot; half the time on raids and still get 24+ pieces of loot per night, and I won't feed you bullshit about how you can get a full set of ornate in 1 night by camp-jumping and KSing in BoT.<br />
<br />
I love this quote - it gets a giant flashing BINGO! from me.<br />
<br />
Yes Sassinak, I do understand it in concept, tho it never was my game and so I don't have real experience, but as I keep saying it doesn't matter a whit to me what it's like up there as I was never gonna get there.  My main thrust has always been that items != progress and that the casual game runs out of progress.  The whole LDoN EP items thing came outta some rumour that EP quality gear would be attainable via LDoN.  And so, when those that don't know told the 30  hour a week *casual* player contingent, how the game was for them, I enjoined the dialogue.  I never meant to imply that single groups should be able to loot EP drops, just that I think a single group path to be able to *zone in* would be a big, big plus. Lemme try to organize waves of that for my small guild, then we can have a big recruitment party where all our ex-members come and help us try to do something exciting in a new zone and maybe loot up.  [[[EDIT::The bit you quoted was me adjusting a comparison between apples and oranges, not a suggestion or desire of mine.  Am fek tired and stuff is sinking thru my noggin atm.  I was saying that I thought thing A was more like this, instead of that as someone had posted. But I think your point finally settled into my noggin, halfway through a CoH mission.]]]<br />

Gunnar, I dunno how old ye be, but I'm 36, holding down two jobs at the moment and getting by on the mortgage.  The house ex-druid and I generally chat and surf the internet during raids, without missing a CH in the rotation of losing position on the mob, etc.  We have been very lucky with our social guild - we'd have quit the game months ago without them.  We love being friends with them, and these peeps are the type to get together over the weekend for a BBQ (actually, its this weekend).  Or they'll drop a package in the mail to you unbidden just cuz it somehow came up in chat that you wanted/needed it by the layoffs knocked you on your heels and you're broke.  They're good players, too, having been in the game for 2 years on back to release.  But we will not progress in with them, nor will we leave them to progress.  We've tried the open raids, with little but the horridness of them to keep us awake.  We're done with it.  <br />
<br />
But it is, for me, much less attention grabbing to go on a raid than juggling 4 or 6 mobs in an LDoN mission in a group with no cleric.  I'm usually the puller, too, and so I'm pretty busy.  But as I've pointed out before EP is forever closed to us, and mebbe by that point raids are more invigorating. I dunno what the plane of fire is like, but if it's the same as other PoP zones I've been to where a group finds a safe spot and ploinks single MOBs in to the group, I guess that'd be less attention grabbing, or about the same as raiding.  And, since we ain't raiding GoD, I can't compare to that.  Maybe the got it right at that point - PoP raids have been a long and empty snore (EDIT :: However, I know the hedge walk was a lot of fun for both of us, and felt very *raid-like*, and it is impossible to nap thru the PoJ trials, and I loved Piglet), some Velious events were fun, Luclin raids have been the longest and snoriest (When defensive fires for the third time and I fail to notice ... that's a sign).  The most fun I have had that was raid related over the past year or so was in /tells or /gu.<br />
<br />
I think we'd have liked grouping together if we'd had the opportunity, we do it for the same reasons and from the same perspective, by what you've written.<br />
<br />
ibithor, if you and I go to the same college and I go part time, or take night classes to fit around my day job, I should be able to find a way to take the same courses required courses you do and complete the same degree, even if I have to take a couple of different maths or alter choose different electives.   Often, you will find that there are more than one acceptable pre-requisite to get into a class, for example.  By the time I have my degree, you will be well off to a thriving career as a physics dude.  When you turn off ogre mode, you make good sense, but with it on you seem to deliberately miss the point.  There have been no FUCKING MORONS posting in here, tho that sort of rhetoric made you look dangerously close to being one.  I commend you on backing off to a reasonable attitude.<br />
<br />
FWIW, finding a random_warrior00 to go to Tak is easy.  Finding a guildie who would enjoy it, or a robe who needed the upgrades, not so much.  Fortunately for me, I don't need you to believe my life for it to be the way it is - it continues to be what it is even when I don't believe it.  I'm not worried about getting EP level toys outta LDoN, I never said I was.<br />
<br />
I have a dim memory of an SOE type saying that EQ2 will be more casually playable than EQ1, tho not that SOE is planning on splitting the play groups into a raid-game product (EQ1) and a non-raid-game product (EQ2).  Mebbe you and I are remembering snippets from the same dialogue and I missed it a little.<br />
<br />
Fynepsia, Flair and Fitemore are voicing for the non-raider very, very well, and with significantly more investment than I have, as they still play the game.  I don't anticipate responding to any more points on this as they are doing it better, and from a living viewpoint near my passed perspective. <br />
<br />
For the heck of it, I'll try to pare it down to my thesis: LDoN ain't 200 or 100 points an hour for very, very many of the peeps who would gain the most by the obtainable upgrades there.  Casual, non-raiding types want to feel like they are getting somewhere - or at least that they can get somewhere - and not just running in circles for the sake of killing time.  They love the game, too, and deserve better than scorn, disdain, or ridicule for wanting something out of it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>DG-Slider</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">Well that's the key. People ARE leaving it. If the casual players leave, which SOE claims is the majority, then first they'll have to consolidate servers. They would also make less content due to the incredible loss of income. They will have to lay off developers and designers. There CS will suffer even more. If they don't change things, the trend will be for WoW and EQ2 will gut EQ totally, even if they don't cater towards power gamers. EQ as you know it will die. Now, that might sound doom and gloom, but if they don't maintain a wide appeal it will come true. YOU will suffer for unhappy casual gamers; this is your problem too.<br />
<br />
That is one of the most basic and truthful statements I have heard. I hope that the RAIDER players read this closely. EQ is a game for profit and if the money stops coming in... Sony will just shut it down. Then you have no place to raid. Think it through before screaming how unfair it is for 70 players to have to split 8 items a night or about time investment. That is not or should not really be the issue. The issue should be flexibility of play style and appeal to all gamers. Truth is the same quality items should be available through raiding, questing, LDoNs and single group camps. That caters to all styles of play and keeps any of us from having to play the game in a set method. Before any raiders start attacking me, please look at my link and see I came from raiding and due to a job change I CANNOT play that way any longer. It sucks, I miss raiding but I love the game and still want to enjoy it. As a casual gamer, I can state that the game does not have many outlets for casual gameplay and it is hard to stay motivated. I own 3 accounts and 2 other casual gaming friends have a couple each. All are dissatisfied, and although that's only 7 accounts, that is money that will no longer be going towards maintenance, development, and NEW CONTENT. Let's see how all the raiders feel when you have everything from the Gods and there is nowhere to go b/c LDoN and regular zones are a downgrade. Guess raiders will cancel then... we can see where this goes... Please, make the plight of the casual gamer an issue for yourself and for the game. Try to put yourself in their place, and appreciate the luxury you have of being able to play often and raid. You already see content many other gamers will never look upon short of screenshots.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">Let me say again I agree that eq needs more content that doesn't require a raid force or ep+ gear.That doesn't mean that the rewards for that content should imbalance the game or undermine the efforts of hardworking guilds.You don't and shouldn't need ep mold type gear to adventure and progress in 1 group content.If it's a measuring thing you'll never be happy anyways.Raiding through ep's into time takes more effort and is more challenging than casually  adventuring 1 group content.Sure some people ride on the backs of others in guilds like on all types of teams,but, they're missing the fun of it and I bet thier upgrades will never satisfy them.<br />
<br />
There should be room for all types of raid guilds.On Stromm we have guilds in time already who raid a lot of hours every week.They tend to be much more &quot;hardcore&quot;( or at least the core elements of thier guilds do) and focus on winning above all.My guild would be ranked about 3rd on our server.The majority of our players probably raid 10 hours a week and fit in what other time they can for xp and group play.Some more and some less.With good morale we've steadily progressed since soon after Stromm opened and have taken down Xegony and and FRO.There are other casual raid guilds with us in ep's and many family type guilds creeping closer.Raiding has become a big part of the game now and shouldn't be undermined imo.By the same token I think they should stress the adventuring part of the game once again and fill out content for the pre-time players.Fun content with places to go,stuff to overcome and shiny toys to win doesn't have to yield tangible rewards= to same level raid content to be enjoyable.Too much stuff is getting dumbed down as if the Dev's think sudden success will sell eq 2.<br />
<br />
Hehe yeh Dogg ,I'm only a poorly oiled 37 myself,about average in my guild.We raid on a limited time frame and stuff is busy come raid time.Maybe raiding older stuff has a cleric can be easier on ppl.However, some of my best friends are clerics and our raids often manage to tire them out, unlike my usual constant 5 pulls in LDON.My wife is a shammy and finds our raiding stressful,but, challenging and fun.I ma normally and am either running around like a chicken minus his head( I umm highly support Knights ma'n during clearing btw :) ),or, trying to eek out time to type assist commands.For all of the people I can speak for, our raiding is far more intensive and demanding than playing in a simple group.And it should be so imo.</div></div><hr />

What do you feel about adding, say. a new wayfarers camp. Points from old do not carry over. Difficulty is such that you must be able to do current Hard LDoN's fairly easiely, but you have similiar quality to EP Loot on the merchants?<br />
<br />
That sounds great to me.  I would just like to see the way you earn the points be a little more creative than the current LDoN. <br />
<br />
Make me bang my head against the wall with 6-12 friends against some encounter where if I win we might some loot and a nice chunk of points, but if we fail we get nothing. We know they can do lockout timers. Lock me out of this for some period of time if I win so I can't just easily farm it (a la raid content). <br />
<br />
Make LDoN style grinds that are challenging enough to warrant getting points toward this nicer armor that take the same 90 minutes for when I don't have a large chunk of time, but still want to do something (&lt;-- What LDoN is currently, just wanted to stress higher difficulty).<br />
<br />
Let me go on an overly difficult adventure at each of the existing wayfarers where the reward is a token for each member of the group with potential for decent side drops along the way. You take the 5 tokens and turn them in to some guy at the new camp which unlocks some new items on the merchants and a new zone set. <br />

<br />
I'm not at all in favor of adding elemental level equipment to Ldons, and there's a reason for that.  ANYTHING you make available to the casual player is still 100% available to any up and coming raiding guild, and people in guilds generally tend to have far more resources at their fingertips at pulling together organized, disciplined groups for any difficult task you can think of.  The fact is, with the introduction of GoD, I'm already starting to see this.  What am I supposed to think when a member of another guild that I know, one that hasn't even beaten Rallos Zek the Warlord yet, is linking me 195hp/195mana items that they're WEARING on their backs?  The fact is, is that up until Rztw, there isn't anything that's better than a 125/125 ratio item, and now you're throwing 195/195 items into the fray.  Sure, this is bound to happen in all aspects of the game when new expansions come out, but NOT that dramatically.  That's just one or two items, but now you're introducing a complete set of elemental level armor to any non-elemental level player.<br />
<br />
Do you have any idea of the dramatic increase in power guilds become after equipping themselves in elemental level armor?<br />
<br />
The elementals are your reward for beating Rallos Zek and completing the flags before it, and the difficulty of those mobs such as LMM and Bertox are because your guild is only getting 1, maybe 2 pieces of loot per member, per month.  By giving pre-elemental guilds *access* to elemental quality loot, you're not just being helped climbing over a mountain, you're flying a goddamn helicopter over it. <br />

How many clerics does it take to keep an ornate level tank alive against MM?  You figure, he has ~8700hp and ~1450ac, right?  How many clerics does it take to keep an elemental level warrior alive with ~10,300hp and ~1900ac.   The difference is about 7-8 on the ornate level and 5-6 for the elemental level.  For those experienced with the elemental planes, you know EXACTLY what I'm talking about when I say that's the difference between the necessary healing power required for Reparm and the necessary healing power required for Druav.  <br />
<br />
So, finalizing, I'm not in favor of adding this kind of tier set to non-raiders.  There's NOTHING there that will stop those in up and coming raiding guilds from benefiting also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>ibithor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">thats an excellent point. pull up the ldon leaderboard, notice the most wins belong mostly to the top guilds? its because they can rape the content, as they would do in any elementall lvl gear stuff. it would be easy to PL toons for points, as is being done now im sure for ldon and gear up a totally inexperienced toon to elemental levels. way to go, great plan. sure alts get loots now, but honestly you dont see many that are fully elemental geared. the effort involved for the reward makes a guild unwilling to commit the resources to equip an alt or a clueless player. on the other hand, its not hard to imagine folks selling ldon points on ebay much like they do plat. it would work like for x dollars they put you in their uber ldon farm group and you rack up the wins while you work. so now we could actually have brand new kind of fuckwad, the awesomely geared but no clue what he's dong original owner. hmm, thats a good idea actually, lol wish i had a 3rd comp and i could start a stay at home business lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u73"><b>CyrzB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p73">Well, yes, adding better loot availible outside of the PoP Progression would allow people to progress in PoP faster. But that happens with expansions. When a new one comes out, the old ones becomes easier.<br />
<br />
My suggestion was, with each expansion, ensure that single group content receives similiar attention. I beleive that GoD attempted to do this, but failed for many reasons. I think most of us are familiar with the reasons GoD as a whole failed.<br />
<br />
I'm really not seeing Doggabone's point about zoning in, but I'm not certain that him and I are even having the same discussion. Are you asking for new zones to see as a 6-12 person group? Or are you really asking for a 6 man group to have the ability to enter Elemental Planes?<br />
<br />
I will admit that PoP has unprecendented amounts of zones many people will never see even the zone in of. Kunark had what, 3 keyed zones, and 2 of the keys were fairly easy? Velious has Sleepers Tomb, unless you count that old Skyshrine key quest to get to CS the first time, which I wouldn't, Luclin had Vex Thall and that Inner Acyrlia thinger that like 3 guilds did, and maybe the Arx.<br />
<br />
The zones are nice. but not that nice. Want to see Plane of Fire? Take a level 20 to Burning Woods, and pretend the dragons that eat you were Fire Elementals. Plane of Air? Run back and forth through the tunnel in Dreadlands a few dozen times. Water? Take that level 20 to Kedge and pretend whatever kills you looks just like it looks like. Earth could be Burning woods if you turned off the effects to put out the fire, and the dragons are lockjaw and earth elementals.<br />
<br />
Are you suggesting going to fire to get friends to help you drop mobs and loot them? I still think you are underestimating these mobs, but lets leave that aside. It was stated very early on in PoP that mini's in Fire, for example, are easier to beat then Rallos Zek, and drop better gear. The Devs responded with yes, this is true, and we intended it to be so. These drops are intended as a further reward for gaining access to these planes. <br />
<br />
There is what, 250, 300 zones in EQ? There's a lot of places to satisfy your hunger to explore, rather on focusing on the 10 or 15 you can't yet.<br />
<br />
I am, absolutely, 100% behind any casual players desire for content with new expansions. I don't see the reasoning that this content should be the same content raiders are using. With new gear from new expansions, new levels, and new AA, eventually EP will end up like NToV- Anyone can get there if they try. If GoD did not do this, I'm behind any petition you guys want to make up to send to the devs. <br />
<br />
Yeah, I'm a bit tired of reading the posts about raiders afking the whole time- I wonder how that would work against Xegony? Or the ones about how if we don't pay attention to them, EQ will fail. I, at least, am trying to. And raiding players aren't an insignificant part of the market either.<br />
<br />
I dunno, maybe I'm grumpy. Maybe I'm missing something.<br />
<br />
In fact, maybe I know what it is. You want to add &quot;progression&quot; to the casual gamers experiance.<br />
<br />
What we may need to move this forward is a defination of what progression means to the casual player. Much like we have to accept the fact that you need progression in your gaming experiance, you need to accept the fact that it needs to end up in a different, but quite possibly similiar, destination then the raids do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u74"><b>Alisdahre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p74">the problem with your version of the college scenario is that we arent taking the same classes even if you split the schedule. splitting the schedule amounts to faster raids, but they should still need 60 folsk for difficulty<br />
<br />
physics=mobs that hit for 3k, have 3k procs or 3k ae's<br />
<br />
bowling=current ldon mobs<br />
<br />
You're missing mudflation.  Time = mudflation.  As time goes on, and more EQ expansions are released, mudflation grows more and more.<br />
<br />
In old world EQ, physics equaled Nagafen, and bowling equaled a frog in Lower Guk.  Now a mob with the same stats as Naggy is a joke.<br />
<br />
Kunark, physics was Trakanon and Venril Sathir.  They're jokes now too.<br />
<br />
Velious, once again, a number of mobs that weren't touchable by anything but the largest guilds are now one groupable.<br />
<br />
etc.<br />
<br />
As time goes on, the casual players become powerful enough to take on the encounters that were once raid only.  They progress, just far slower since they can't be online for numerous hours every day to be a part of a large raiding guild.  They progress with their small guilds, or their one grouped friends.  And eventually get there.<br />
<br />
That is why his college analogy fits perfectly.  Given enough night classes twice a week, that student can eventually get through the same class &quot;progression&quot; too.  It will just take him far longer because he doesn't have the time to put any more into it.  And I do mean progression.  Physics does not straight out equal the biggest mob at the time.  You have prerequisites that are required to get to those final classes and finally to attain the degree.  It's not like a physics major is impossible for someone who can only go part time.  Everyone, even the full time physics majors had to start at physics 101 before they were ready for physics 501.  Just because they're full time physics students doesn't mean they're taking on tougher challenges than the part time student.  It just means they'll get to the tougher challenges quicker, and take them on first.  The degree is the same, it just takes longer to get it.  The part time student will take a lot longer to build up his skills till he's ready for physics 501.  But he'll get there if he doesn't give up.  Same with the full time student.  He just had the added benifit of larger chunks of time to do it all a lot faster, and to get to the top ahead of the other guys quicker.<br />
<br />
The number of people it requires to make an encounter difficult becomes moot as mudflation, new level increases, new AAs, and new spells continue to grow.  Those numbers won't be required anymore at that point.  It'll be easier cause of what the new updates bring.  Just like how the Computer Science department at my old college is now teaching DirectX and C++.  They've expanded into newer, better, more powerful, easier to use, and easier to learn technologys that weren't available when I went to school there.  This is how the game has always worked, and will continue to work in the future.  <br />
<br />
Saying casuals don't have the right to what you did and had 3 or 4 expansions in the past is bullshit, cause there's no preventing it.  It's gonna happen, it's always happened, and it will continue to happen as long as this game is constantly being added to.  And it shouldn't be prevented either.  It should be encouraged.  Contrary to what it seems like most full time raiders believe,  casuals haven't been sitting in the same exp zone everyday since Kunark.  They're progressing as well, at a far slower pace because of the limitations on their time or simply their choice of play style.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>Celeritum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">Gee, I guess I missed the memo that said EQ is being primarily designated towards raiding content alone, what with the LoY and LDoN expansions which both were released AFTER PoP. You know, the two expansions that the high end guilds screamed bloody murder because Sony wasn't releasing anything for the &quot;raiders&quot; to do.<br />
<br />
Fact is, every argument that's being posted against better ldon gear is based soley on the pride of high end raiding mentality. &quot;We beat xyz so we deserve better gear than you.&quot; Sorry, that's not the way it should work. Do you realize how greedy that makes you sound? Just because you chose to play the game via a different route than somebody else? Some people don't want to play the game like that, some people enjoy not being constrained to raiding a certain amount of times per week for a certain amount of hours. Why should that be the only way to get great rewards out of the game? <br />
<br />
Newsflash for you high end raiding folks; nothing you do during the x hours a week you raid entitles you to better gear than what casual folks do during the x hours a week they decide to play - as long as both sides of the coin are working their hardest to be the best they can be the way they play the game. If you ENJOY coming home after work / school / whatever and forming up in your nice little groups and taking orders from your officers, power to you - you're playing the game the way you want. Don't let your virtual jealousy destroy the game for the OTHER people of the community that enjoy playing the game differently.<br />
<br />
God it's not even like this is the same expansion as PoP. It's two who expansions later. Get over yourselves already. Sony releases new content to give people something new to do. Why shouldn't casual players be able to realisitically see armor and weapons that high end players got to see TWO EXPANSIONS AGO, without being forced to change their play habits? Why is there so little respect for the people who just don't want to play the game like you do?</div></div><hr />

you can already do most of the content from 2 expansions ago, BUT NOT ALL BECAUSE IT WAS DESIGNED FOR RAIDING. do you want them to go back and retune the encounters for you?<br />
<br />
<br />
what you appear to be asking for is the magical ability to buy an expansion and that should instantly make you be able to gimp previous content regardless of the actual effort or experiences you previously had. if thats not what you want, why dont you fucking write it out in simple words so even a thick ogre like me can understand it, cuz so far all thats comin outta yer piehole is bullshit whining<br />
<br />
maybe you havent checked my gear asswipe, its bought, pickup raid or ldon, i DID spend months getting my gear farming, ldoning and doing pickup flagging. i dont feel it should have been significantly easier for me to do, that to me would be a slap in the face to all the warriors who went before me and took years to get to the gear level they are at. on previous toons i decked my cleric out in full skyshrine back when velious was the top, i got my necro elemental flagged before GoD was out. Now im playing a warrior and i know the path before me yet i dont comlain, i just play on and i enjoy it.<br />

umm someone else already said they read that sony was making eq2 more casual friendly than eq1, perhaps im reading more into it but to me that does imply that eq1 is not geared to casual players as much as eq2 will be. i have looked on google for it but i cant find it, and to be honest i dont give a fuck if you believe it or not</div></div><hr />

whether its raid or single group, it should be the same difficulty and i think that pretty much already exists. GoD single groups can yield ele quality loot and the risk versus reward is appropriate. <br />

<br />
Ummm hate to break nothing to me.  They will eventually.  Mudflation.<br />
<br />
why the fuck should that change. you dont see casual single groups doing ntov, aow, or st warders.<br />
<br />
You will.  These things are already being one grouped right now by highly equiped end gamers.  Once agian, mudflation.  It will eventually happen.  The casuals have a progression they can fight their way through just the same as anyone else.  It just takes longer because of their fewer numbers and hours.  My guild with a raid force of 12 can take Vindi.  My previous 30 strong raid force guild could not kill Vindi yet.<br />
<br />
You dont see a casual single group doing a fucking thing in vex thal, anything but rhags in ssra, or seru. Why in gods name should i expect casual single group content in POP in the elementals or plane of time that drops raid quality loot?<br />
<br />
For the exact reason that because the casuals ARE doing Rhags and Seru.  That was unheard of before.  Now it's possible.  Just like Vex Thal will eventualy be possible once a smaller force is strong enough to kill the Emporer.  Of course you don't see people in there yet, cause mudflation hasn't risen enough yet.  But it will.  With level 70 and other new goodies coming, sooner than you think.  I don't expect casual content to be &quot;created&quot; in PoP... I expect to eventually get big enough to do it the way it is now.  Just like how every expansion that comes makes more and more of that previously unreachable content reachable.  The people at the end game are constantly finishing expansions and hitting a wall.  No where to go till the next expansion.  The head room for casuals is limitless.  There will always be new content for them without ever hitting their head at the end.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying give casuals the same loots raiders are getting.  They're working towards it at a slower pace, with mudflation and scouted knowledge they've gained from people that did it before them.  You seem confused, as if you haven't &quot;thoroughly&quot; read a single thing anyone has been saying.  No one is saying create content that both a raid and a casual can do at the same time for the same reward in the same zone while high fiving each other (or flipping each other off as the case may be).  We're talking about going through the same content later and getting loot that a raider has had rotting in his bank the last 1-4 expansions.  You know, how this game has operated since the first expansion came.  You seem to want to deny us that and lock us all up in Karnor, throwing the key away, simply because we chose not to be bored with our game time by joining large end game guilds.<br />
<br />
There is plenty of single groupable loot dropping mobs in pop for casual players, why are you so greedy that you have to have the upper crust too?<br />
<br />
You haven't listened to anything I've typed.  You, a greedy person, just called me greedy for wanting to continue playing this game the way it has been played by many for 5 years now.  You're the one trying to lock us out of content.  Content that is obsolete or becoming obsolete in the future when we're able to do it.<br />
<br />
When the new expansion comes out more of GoD will become single groupable, but its dumb to expect the top end encounter areas to become a playground for noob trains, kser's, griefers, and the ilk.<br />
<br />
That's your problem right there.  You think casual = noob trains, kser's, griefers, no exceptions.  You're prejudice against casuals.  I'll give you the real definition.  Casual means you don't log on every day, &quot;nothing more&quot;.  Casual does not mean you are not in a guild.  Casual does not mean you lack skill at playing this game.  Casual does not mean you don't progress.  Casual does not mean you have no ambition to bigger and better things once you're prepaired for them.  You have a completely false vision of casual players.  Noob trainers = noob trainers, nothing more, guild or no guild, hours of freetime to play or no time to play.  Griefers are griefers, nothing more.<br />
<br />
and thats exactly who would head there, look at BoT if you doubt my word, it used to be a great zone to xp in, but once they opened it to the public it became the new KC with trains, ks'ing, and general shittiness.<br />
<br />
BoT became filled with idiots, not just casuals.  I've been trained by people from the biggest guild on our server on many occasions.  I've never trained a soul.  I've never griefed, ks'd, nor have I ever played my character to the description &quot;general shittiness&quot;.  Gasp, I must not be a casual then.  The number of hours I'm able to play a week beg to differ though...  I am a casual player.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u85"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p85">Ibithor I don't think the question is one of difficulty, but rather one of the resources required. Some of us don't want to join a large guild to do 72 person zergfests, nor do we have the time to do so. We're happy doing stuff like GoD trials, hard ldons, or old content that can be single grouped, but there are some slots that just aren't available to be upgraded. Weapons being the most glaring example. <br />
<br />
I agree that being able to get EP level gear from grinding easy LDoN's is way too easy. I'm fully in support of changing the LDON progression so you can't get the good stuff from just grinding easy adventures, but right now that option isn't available, and hence the complaints.<br />
<br />
Many EP guilds nowadays aren't getting by on skills, they just zerg every encounter, so give up on the &quot;difficulty&quot; argument. They don't backflag, and lots of their members get EP flagged by afk'ing through open raids. <br />

<br />
is there anyone here who actually has fully outfitted themselves in ldon and moved on to GoD and felt the single group/casual progression is broken? or is it just the people who are wanting an easy ride to good gear?<br />
<br />
How can you even discuss this stuff when you aren't even reading what other people post? Look below, this my post on the page before to the EXACT same question you just asked for the second time!<br />
<br />
<br />
First, here is the links to the characters I did most of my LDoNs with:<br />
<br />
Rogue - http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=20720<br />
Cleric - http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=770298<br />
<br />
As you can see, nearly every slot is either a LDoN vendor purcahsed, hard dropped, or there was a comparable droppable piece so it wasn't worth spending points on.<br />
<br />
I loved LDoN for a while, but as you do more and more adventures you just want to pull your hair out. I think the concept of points as well as nice drops from hards was perfect. They simply just needed to make more variety of stuff to do. If you actaully wanted to gear up beyond just getting a Tak BP and a pair of anger augs, it was just way too repetitive. <br />
<br />
As for GoD, I have loved the single group stuff here as well. It's challenging and rewarding. However, it is very limited and annoying that every drop goes in the same 4 slots (ears, fingers, range, wrists). There are no good visible slot items and no weapons. Besides rangers (stonewood bows), non-raiding melee are stuck at velious/luclin level weaponly where raiding weapons have taken off to completely new levels. <br />
<br />
Maybe in the devs eyes, the non-raiding player was supposed to get visible armor and weapon upgrades in LDoN and then get the non-visible slots from GoD, but since my group was compeltely done with LDoN before GoD even came out, it just feels slightly lacking without any visible armor and weapon upgrades.<br />
<br />
I don't ever want or expect current raid level items, but what I would like is to have enough itemezied content aimed towards dedicated non-raiding players to always be a few steps behind the equally dedicated raiding player.<br />
<br />
No one is asking for a free ride. I don't think anyone even wants a free ride. It's not even fun to play when there is no challenge. People are just asking for more real content aimed at smaller groups. It's not to lead them to raid content some day. It's to lead them to an entirely different path with entirely different rewards.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ibithor, based on what you have said about your characters. You are either a really crappy physicist or an amateur bowler.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u88"><b>ibithor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p88">alis, the progression you speak of is already happening as you give above examples, that will continue to happen. what people seem to be asking for is content that gives ep quality loot for ldon difficulty adventures and thats not something i can support even if they have to do a million adventures for one piece of loot. velious quality gear shouldnt drop off orc pawns no matter how many you kill. people will continue to do older content as new expansions come out, im all for that. i dont realy see what you are wanting to change<br />
<br />
bard, you and i seem to be on the same page or at least in the same chapter. i agree that weapon upgrades are hard to come by but that could be addressed even in the current ldon situation. just add a couple nice weapon drops in hard ldons. i have seen decent weapons drop in GoD trials so far as well. <br />
<br />
i stand by my statement about the elementals should remain flagged as they are now. it would be all to easy for griefers to train raids in places like fire and earth and as it stands now its not a huge problem because to get there takes a good bit of effort and most folks arent willing to throw away all that work by being a trainer, but in bot, there are people who are known for training named groups and ks'ing them or just training them to grief. any amount of filtering we can get for these people is more than welcomed<br />
<br />

fyn, when you say yer bored with the content i can respect that, you HAVE done it already. and you are asking for an entirely new system or set of adventures of substantially more difficulty correct or at least add items to current GoD loot tables?  but all the folks complaining about it and they arent even ready to do ldon hards is just silly. It would be like me begging for uqua to be retuned when im not even at that stage of the game yet<br />
<br />
 I don't ever want or expect current raid level items, but what I would like is to have enough itemezied content aimed towards dedicated non-raiding players to always be a few steps behind the equally dedicated raiding player. <br />
<br />
I totally agree with you there.  But i think at this point we arent really talking about casual players. We are just talking about non raiders. You sound like a hardcore player to me, i dont know how long or how often you play, but im guessing its more than a few hours a night :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u89"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p89">What do you suggest in response to the non-raiders' requests? Just saying &quot;no, unacceptable&quot; or do you have a counter suggestion that would be acceptable to you?</div></div><hr />

For those raiders out there that are so worried about non-uber raiders getting gear that's only 2 or 3 expansions behind yours - what do you think happens to the game when we leave?  Do you think there will be more expansions?  Do you think there will be equivalent CS?<br />
<br />
The non-uber raiders are the majority in EQ and we pay the bulk of the subscription fees that keep the game running.  As of now there hasn't been an alternative game for us to play - but that's changing very soon.<br />
<br />
As to the argument that &quot;I had to do blah blah so everyone else has to do it to&quot; - that's a load of crap IMHO.  If you really believe that then don't use portal stones, don't use new abilities, don't use new gear, etc.<br />
<br />
Also, please quit trying to tell us how difficult or easy given content is - it's obvious that you have no clue about the game we play.  I'm sick of people continually arguing that hard ldon's can easily be done in an hour or that normal can be done in 30 minutes - that's not even remotely true for people like me.<br />
<br />
One more item - don't give me that line about putting in your time - I also put in about 30 hours a week, but I get nowhere near the reward a raider would get for 30 hours a week.<br />
<br />
Yeah, I've become a bit disgruntled with the focus on high-end raiders and their whining and I'll probably be cancelling my second account soon - just like a lot of other hard-core non-uber raiders out there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
hardcore non raiders have legitimate beefs if they have already done the ldon and god content and still feel they need upgrades-these complaints should be heard and addressed. perhaps they shjould be better vocalized and more eloquently stated so even a dimwit like me cant mistake your intent<br />
<br />
<br />
true casual players really have no legitimate complaints gearwise. you are where you are by your playstyle and what you choose to do when you log in. if you want to tradeskill, pursue quests with mediocre rewards or set up healing camps for noobs in oasis, then its not sony's fault or problem that you dont have uber gear<br />
<br />
if true casual players want to complain there isnt enuff quests, tradeskill stuff, or single group content (provided they arent complaining about loot quality) then we should listen and address it if its valid<br />
<br />
going back to the college thing, which was poorly understood by some.  Hardcore nonraiders are the ones doing the night classes and taking the physics.  they do deserve similar rewards altho much slower as the full time student taking calculus(hardcore raiders). the &quot;true casuals&quot; are the ones enrolled either full time or part time(doesnt matter) and taking basketweaving(where you missed that reference to tradeskills is beyond me) and bowling. they arent going to get the same end result and they shouldnt.  time spent vs reward is irrelevant, its risk vs reward that should count</div></div><hr />

BoT was supposed to be a hard zone to get into.  Originally you had to beat the giant lords in PoStorms, who were as difficult as Avatar of War, they were blowable events, and were only available every 3 days.  The rewards in BoT reflected the fact that the zone was hard to get into.  BoT was a mini-elemental plane in this sense.<br />
<br />
When the BoT quest was made easier by putting medallions on the mini-bosses in PoStorms, the loot drop rates in BoT were reduced to reflect the fact that entry was easier.  This produced an uproar.  Nobody was upset at the easier access, but they were all upset at the fungus clumps dropping in place of ornate.<br />
<br />
Today, to get into BoT, you have to be .... level 62.  But the rewards were restored to the original AoW-lord level.  And now everyone thinks of BoT-caliber risk/reward as being the baseline.  Any place that has worse rewards than BoT is considered broken.  Any place that is harder to access than BoT is considered unfair.<br />
<br />
All I have to say is, congrats to those who pressured Sony to open up BoT. :P<br />
<br />
Anyway, when everyone is level 70, I think you will find that RZTW will be killable by just about any guild/pickup that can field 40 random players, so the elementals (and Kod'Taz) will evolve into generally available zones pretty fast.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not sure you have to had done both LDoN and GoD content to want to see another tier of LDoN material.  A harder and harderest additional level to new LDoN content with corresponding purchase paths would make another rung or 2 for &quot;hard core non raiders&quot;.<br />
<br />
GoD != LDoN for design for this audience.  Although the rewards are a step up the structure of how you do it not the same as LDoN (little logistics needed to reach a LDoN camp for instance).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u95"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p95">I view LDON as a necessary evil these days .The weapon augs are like almost mandatory now.It really seems a crass way to spend your time in an rpg though.Banging through the same dungeons over and over to collect spendng points.I really think that LDON's while adding neded access to upgrades have helped to diminish EQ.Like a lot of dumbing down in eq it seems to reinforce the notion that your next upgrade is &gt; all.It reduces adventuring to a stark loot equation that has by design removed any mystery or distraction from the pursuit of the next aug,slot piece etc.Along with xp mods for groups,200 sense heading,etc.etc. EQ is becoming a treadmill of the most efficient upgrade path with utilities in place to make alternative choices seem a waste of time by comparison.I'm glad I found a home with a guild before the LDON thing.I would have gone insane grinding endlessly for slot pieces.Where is the fun or adventure in it?<br />
<br />
I'd like to see more open avenues off progression opened up outside of raiding.More dungeons to explore,quests to do and adventures to embark on for level 65 players of all types with appropiate rewards for the challenge.The whole thing of logging in, running to a wayfarer camp to form a group,bashing your way for the 30th time through the same dungeon to add another batch of points to your tally so you can keep up with warrior jones kinda sucks.But hey,provided you find the people ;it's easy,takes little time,has a painless cr and GUARANTEES reward for your time on a win.<br />
<br />
I agree that to a point it's semantics.However,SOE has reinforced the idea to such a point that people are obligated to ldon and the majority of Norrath gathers dust.I'd like to see the next level of gear evolve outside of LDON in more adventurous settings that didn't absolutely demand perfect group make up.The rewards should be in keeping with the challenges,perhaps, some better pieces being rewarded for finishing 1 way flagged missions that can't be farmed after completion.Perhaps,a bp for the turn in of a goblin kings head to a local regent etc.This doesn't mean you should get an ep style  piece for dropping a Vindi type mob.There's a lot of middle ground ,however.<br />
<br />
Yeh, level 70 is going to see a lot of new people in the ep's and a lot of previously raid content getting dropped by 1 group of casual players.However,EP mold droppers will still be out of reach for  single groups.It'll be quite awhile yet before a group of players can drop Blazzax I imagine and equal rewards should be similarily distant.</div></div><hr />

just one small point AoW drops the barbarian mask  which is still raid content and there is no equivalent to it that I have spotted in LDoN (you can match ONE of  hp or AC with an augment but not both and need to then match the stats)  although I'm assumeing that you have bought it and not killed AoW :)<br />

<br />
The charms are correct. I have all flags up through tactics (pov/pos, BoT, CoD, Torment, Tactics, HoH) by completing the side quests which gives me 6/10 for the base charm and I have maxed out LDoN augment on the charms from have over 400 LDoN wins. The magelos are indeed correct. <br />
<br />
As for GoD drops. There are 3 masks which could be seen as comparable or better that you don't need a raid force to get: Guise of Seething Satisfaction, Incantor Mask of Death, and Gaunt Veil of Purification. (I don't have first hand knowledge of Ageless Relic Protector, but from what I have read you do not need a raid force with the right tactics).<br />
<br />
As for the point of your post, I'm not even sure what it is unless it is to claim that I am lying?<br />
<br />
If it is to claim that I have &quot;raid&quot; loot, well that is indeed correct if you consider age old content that can now be killed with 1-2 groups (yes, even AoW) raid content. I have a handful of Velious raid level items that I purchased in the bazaar. These items don't take a raid level force to get in the bazaar. The tradeskiller who never even fights can earn the money to purchase them. The bazaar mogul who does nothing but buys and sells can get them. If I had my drothers there would be a lot more droppable items, but recent history shows that SoE doesn't want to make the high end stuff droppable so now the non-raiding player can no longer get this calibur of item through saving a bit at a time from what they can do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u98"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p98">Actually, I think the key quests don't count towards your charm. At very least, Tactics doesn't. BoT does and PoJ trials do, but I think those are the only ones that add to the charm. You only get AAs for those two quests, not any of the others. Also, those side quests do NOT count towards your EP flags. That's where they very seriously screwed up on these quests. They could have made them alternates for backflagging instead of for experience groups only. Again, BoT and PoJ trials are the exceptions.</div></div><hr />

I'm really not seeing Doggabone's point about zoning in, but I'm not certain that him and I are even having the same discussion. Are you asking for new zones to see as a 6-12 person group? Or are you really asking for a 6 man group to have the ability to enter Elemental Planes?<br />
Responding cuz you deserve it, not cuz it'd add anything.  The quote is snippeted, obviously.  And so, allowing myself to try to clarify one more time, tho I'm sure I had promised myself I wouldn't.<br />
<br />
We are having a different conversation, but not as differing as you may think, and only cuz my intent didn't come across, and the more I tried to explain it the more my point got lost, I s'pose.  I'm gonna try to figger out why it seems everyone thinks I want better GEAR.  I don't - I want a fek reason to GET better gear, the gear I have serviced me well enough for all the game that was open to me, and for all the game that was going to be open to me.<br />
<br />
<br />
I guess my question now is... if you are not using LDoN raids as a stepping stone, why do you want EP Quality Items? <br />
From a post of yers a few below my first in this thread, and at the time I took it as a direct question to me but thought little of it.  As I had written nothing about wanting EP Quality Items (which you noted and adressed later).  I had written this, and you had quoted it:<br />
Frankly, if you can't see any worth in upgrading the loot tables or vendor lists in LDoN, you probably don't need the upgrades enough for it to affect you, anyway.<br />
I wrote this, too:<br />
I would have really, really liked to see some progression built into LDoN that would have eventually allowed one to purchase and augment gear that would come near in quality to EP drops, or any feeling of progression at all for that matter.<br />
I bolded the bits that were important to me at the time.  I don't think I got the significance of that across originally.<br />
<br />
Add this paragraph of mine ...<br />
As far as putting EP level gear on LDoN merchants, or the components to build it, I am not so much for it or against it as I have taken to harping that LDoN isn't as quick and simple for many of the players out there as some think, and that if it were on the table, it would take a long time to get to for the typical non-raid level toon.<br />
Cuz if yer not raiding, you run out of zones to progress to, you just keep tweaking your gear. (And that's what killed the game for me.)<br />
That just touches on two points, so I split em apart for emphasis.<br />
<br />
This is the first direct reference I was able to find that specifically tied EP quality gear to today's LDoN:<br />
I really can't support EP Level gear on current LDoN missions.<br />
Before this, the references were more vaguely *LDoN*, and some suggestions as to how it could be progressive.  Suggestions which you and others have picked up on, and some good ideas have come out as a result of that.<br />
<br />
You've made reference once or twice to the many, many zones in the game that could be explored (but mostly, with my full suit of gear, wandered).  I did point out that ... well, I have.  LDoN wasn't the only EQ I played, it was my last best source for upgrades to my gear, which didn't really need upgrading anymore, cuz I wasn't gonna get to the tough stuff.<br />
<br />
I'm not asking for anything.  I've commented that flagging zones doesn't work for me, and this is an aesthetic game-mechanic issue, and it goes for all games, everywhere, ad infinitum.  Keys/quests don't wrankle so much, at least they have a story to 'em.  Part of the fun of visiting GoD was stepping over a zone line not knowing how much it was gonna hurt (till we saw the ED guys sprinting past us ...)  If I get butt-raped with a crystal shard when I hit a zone, I know I should stay the hell out.  <br />
<br />
If PoFire was the wrong zone to use by way of example, I wasn't playing that game, and allakhazam doesn't really give explain the differences much.  And, since I wasn't gonna get the raid to get the flag to get permission to enter the zone, I didn't spend the bulk of my time looking there.  So, if anyone got throwed offa the scent by that, *whups*.  It was just a stand-in I used for EP in general, as it was the zone I had seen (and sat in on) a raid, and it was mentioned in the thread.  It's not that I ever wanted to breeze in there and start looting, or even follow my uber chums and loot their kills - it's that I wanted to know that, if I had (for example) all kinds of LDoN gear and was well enough clothed to be viable there, that I could find a way to get in there and hunt - or rally a raid force together, if I wanted - too.  I mighta stuck with the game if that had been the case.<br />
<br />
Given the number of EP and Time geared yabbos I've encounterd, the flagging events are hardly IQ tests, but assuming that it whittles down the dumbasses, there are means other than zerg-fests that can be used and indeed have been.  More alternative means of getting flagged for entry that did NOT require 72 random bodies to huddle together would have been much appreciated - and were, where I found em. <br />
<br />
Events scaled for 6 - 18 people can be as hard or harder than events scaled for 60 - 96 folx.  (The Executioner trial was significantly more difficult for a participant than the raid against that Saran Wrap dragon for HoH was.)  If the raider types want to keep their tea party private, create other zones where the EP flagged aren't allowed to come in and snob up the joint, and lemme flag myself for those.  <br />
<br />
(sotto voce: A side note, about BoT: The third time I zoned in was the third time I couldn't get to the MOBs cuz of the fellaz farming the drops for plat.  And it was the last time I zoned in without a raid.  I would have preferred the fully auged Tak, for most slots - I was there with friends who wanted to make a play.)<br />
<br />
<br />
In fact, maybe I know what it is. You want to add &quot;progression&quot; to the casual gamers experiance.<br />
DING DING DING DING!!!!!  We are having the same conversation, after all.  I know I coulda had better gear by the time I quit - I had a lotta points saved up, I just needed more at Tak - but what woulda been the use of it?  I was upgrading for the sake of upgrading, not to GO anywhere.  That was the glass ceiling I observed.<br />
<br />
I mentioned this elsewhere:<br />
I'm not asking for anything, I'm just chipping in my two cents. Upgrades are meaningless without a sense of progression (5K is more than enogh for LDoN normal, 4K was pretty cozy), and I am not interested in rebuilding my contact network in-game for the third or fifth time.<br />
The only classes open to me were basket-weaving and beer drinking, on my limited resources, and with only 30ish hours a week to futz around with.  So I quit college and spent my tuition money on better beer. <br />
<br />
P.S.:  No-one is asking for easy loot, yet a number are refuting people who they wrongly claim are asking for easy loot - the misquoting and misinterpreting must be near an all-time high in this thread.  Discuss ...  And, on a similar topic: Risk vs. Reward?  EQ is without risk, and there's a significantly better chance I'm gonna eat a death solo or in an XP group than with a raid force.  Timesink vs. Reward is more accurate, in my view.</div></div><hr />
