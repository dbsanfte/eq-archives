My guild is looking at doing the new spawned Inny in Nadox.  A group of us went down to recon the area so we would at least know where to go when we got there with our merry band of ...guinea pigs.... Well we found his spawn point and he was actually up.  We are a small guild and didn't have the forces to take him at the time so we um...decided that discression was the better part of valor and ran screaming like a bunch of little girls.  <br />
<br />
My question is, is if Inny has been spawned and has not been killed, how long does he stay up.  Also does anyone know what the respawn time for the trigger of him is? <br />
<br />
Any other suggestions as to strategies to do this event would also be appreciated.  Thanks!<br />

He also ike to AE a nice little throw around deal. this is a indoor zone so use that to your advantage.</div></div><hr />
