<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sangiovese</div><div class="date">08-15-2003, 01:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just picked up a Norge Tal tonight.  Unfortunately, it was at the end of our raid so I didnt get a chance to really put it to the test yet.<br />
<br />
I normally use CHSD/Blackout when MT on a raid (we have several tanks with better, but we try to rotate the MT duties around so us little guys still have experience).  I was wondering if anyone else has a similar dual wield setup and a Norge Tal... and could give any insight into the relative aggro capabilities of the two setups?<br />
<br />
Playing with it in an exp group (well geared monk, wizzy, druid, and enc slowing) it did just fine... only aggro problems were if it just didn't proc - and that was rare.  But I'm always a little gun shy about trying something new on a raid.<br />
<br />
I figure it'll do ok if I give myself a little time to build aggro before I call everyone in.<br />
<br />
Another thing is I lose about 100 HPs with it equipped (puts me right at 8100).  It seems to me that the reduced ripostes are worth the HP hit.  Any opinions?<br />
<br />
It's one of the weapons I always wanted as a little warrior reading spoiler sites (I prefer a nice two hander if it'll do the job) and when it dropped (and nobody else wanted to spend the dkp on it) I figured I had to give it a good home.  Besides... my TSBS was soooo NToV :)<br />
<br />
Looking forward to hearing from anyone with a similar setup.  if not, I guess my guild will have to be guinea pigs and I'll report back later :)</div></div><hr />

(stay away from critic &amp; flurry not worth it)<br />
<br />
You will be amazed at how well a good 2H (50/40 ish) with some AA holds agro.<br />
Specially raid buffed (ferocity / avatar / thule).<br />
<br />
With it, you should agro faster &amp; more &amp; better than with your previous combo.<br />
You will only need a bit longer head start, but after 2 3 procs<br />
the mob should stick on you like glue.<br />
<br />
As for the AC/HP loss, well the far superior agro lock (and lesser ripostes).<br />
More slow Agro + Less ripostes VS More Snap Agro + More Ac/HP<br />
Its a fair trade :)<br />
<br />
Thats why everyone loves the BoW, not because of its proc rate (rather low).<br />
But because of the sheer DPS it dishes out. Norge'Tal is to my eyes the BoW of Luclin.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry to semi hijack but what 2h AA are there besides PB that are worthwile since I just finished all the defensive AA's myself and was wondering what to get after PB.Was considering crits and flurry :p</div></div><hr />

So are Ferocity and Tactical Mastery. Combat Fury/Fury of the Ages/Flurry/Raging Flurry is a long road but the yield is noticeable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agree on that. But the problem is with 76 AA he's still got a lot of work to do.<br />
Specially to finish all the defensive ones :)<br />
<br />
Critic/Flurry are nice but for all the AA i put into them i'm rather dissapointed.<br />
<br />
Tactical Mastery / Ferocity / Punishing Blade seem to be much more reliable.<br />
<br />
Cant give you parses but for like 50AA between those Critic/Flurry<br />
I have the feeling i dont flurry/critic enough</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes.. Finishing LR (4 and 5) and CS (2 and 3) are my big priorities right now.  And I need to get ID5 as well before I really go out and do offensive AAs.  <br />
<br />
I've gotten a few &quot;fun&quot; AAs along the way, but stuff like flurry is still a long way down the road.<br />
<br />
I am wondering now if I should go ahead and get PB2 and 3 before finishing defensive AAs though... as the extra swings will certainly help my aggro generation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slammer</div><div class="date">08-15-2003, 11:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sang, I use a norge Tal as well.. I am in the same Hps range that you are.. they are right about the proc &quot;pushing Mobs&quot; but i use it to my advantage. Lots of times in POP its hard to position mobs for the MT. The Norge Tal can help u there when /assisting your MT. I have 138 AAs and have Flurry 1 &quot;working on 2 atm all my defensives are done....IMO its is great for exp grps,dps &quot;with the right AAs,MTing and SA..Its also  fun to use in non POP zones to the stun effect can buy you sometime if you need it...Thats really all i can tell ya about it IMO its right up there with SewS, Have fun and enjoy your new toy..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">08-15-2003, 04:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">nice double agro proc, stun + knockback, dont think u will be disappointed. no one has agro issues on raid mobs normally, but if you are not the MT much, id go ahead and snag a few offensive aas - PB and ferocity, TM not bad either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sangiovese</div><div class="date">08-15-2003, 05:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for all the replies.  Can't wait to try it out on our next raid :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Velle</div><div class="date">08-16-2003, 09:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Really good sword! It builds aggro well. IMHO its one of the best aggro building pre-PoP 2Hs for warrior. I have this in my bank now I have SEWS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sangiovese</div><div class="date">08-17-2003, 07:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thought I'd come back and post since I got a chance to test it on raids over the past couple days (Baraguj Szuul in Torment with 3 groups, and a full raid in VT).<br />
<br />
Aggro is spotty while clearing trash (I call for assist as soon as I target the mob while clearing) but it's about the same as my current dual wield setup.  But on boss mobs where I take a few seconds to solo at the beginning the aggro was great!<br />
<br />
I couldn't be happier with this weapon - it's lived up to all the expectations I had.<br />
<br />
Probably the best moment was right before engaging one of the Thall va xakra's in VT I got a tell from one of our wizzies asking me, &quot;Are you gonna MT that with a two hander?&quot;  And then getting the tell afterwards about how he was surprised he didn't get summoned and beat on.<br />
<br />
I think I am set on weapons until I get a BoW :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slammer</div><div class="date">08-18-2003, 02:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Man that is cool as hell to know.. I live and die bye my Norge tal as well..Next thing look into getting some AAs to get more out of it. I just got done with all my Flurry AAs. &quot;cause i  went defensive 1st&quot; ..Your going to be even more thrilled with it.<br />
We were taking down reparm the other nite.. Our MT got a bad proc from him. I was next in line as soon as our MT went down i popped /disc evasive on him and lived threw it all and held agro very well..</div></div><hr />
