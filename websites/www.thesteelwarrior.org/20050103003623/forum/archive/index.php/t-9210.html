<br />
For those of you who've gotten yourself the 10th Coldain Ring (aka Ring of Dain Frostreaver IV), be careful about trying for the follow-up reward! I think there's a bug that causes him to keep your ring if you have an augment on it when you give it to him. I've filed a petition against this, so I'll let you know how it turns out.<br />
<br />
Details:<br />
When you originally get your ring from Sentry Badain at the end of the war, he tells you that you should stop by and see Dain whenever you're in town &quot;and give him your ring&quot; for an extra sign of favor. That sign of favor is a single charge of Divine Aura that is right-clickable from inventory, which is pretty handy to have. So, you give Dain the ring, he returns it along with Protection of the Dain (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=25017).<br />
<br />
Last night I stopped by Dain to see about getting one of these. I gave him my ring .... and he ate it along with the +2 DS augment I had on it.<br />
<br />
Ouch! I thought about killing him right then and there to get it back, but reason prevailed. He's a 70th level raid mob, after all, and I'm a 65th level warrior with no group to back me up. If the petition fails, though ....</div></div><hr />

Old Dwarf men follow me around in the streets weeping with joy, trying to buy me drinks. <br />
<br />
It's kinda sad, really, 'cause I'd like to spank their king and turn his head in for the Belt of Dwarf Slaying (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=4362).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Balfamor</div><div class="date">10-01-2004, 04:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe =)  Probably the augment then =D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sirphoenix_18</div><div class="date">10-01-2004, 09:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Any update, get the ring and/or augment back yet?</div></div><hr />

Thurg but still only warmly to the Dain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lathen</div><div class="date">10-02-2004, 04:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good news!<br />
<br />
Got both the ring and the augment back. The problem, according to the GM who returned the item, is that the augment changes the ID of the ring. Dain cannot recognize it for the ring, so he just eats it.<br />
<br />
If you want to go back for the extra reward, unaugment your ring.<br />
<br />
About faction -- I checked and am max ally with Thurgadin and the Dain.</div></div><hr />

Glad they gave it back that ring is a pain to earn that is for sure. I have never got my Dain faction up to try yet but will remeber about the aug that is for sure</div></div><hr />
