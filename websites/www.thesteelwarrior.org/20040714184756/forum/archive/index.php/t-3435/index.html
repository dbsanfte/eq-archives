<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Splaktar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Can anyone post some of the upgrades here?  Also can use this thread to post them when they go live, maybe on Oct 8th.<br />
<br />
Should be some pretty decent changes to melee Time items in the Oct 8th patch.<br />
<br />
From what I've heard so far... EoE gets some AGL, Runewarded Belt gets Aura of Bravery...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xocin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Time boots, TT arm, Quarm cloak have Faerune<br />
Saryrn girdle has 2 agi and 15 cha<br />
VZ orb and xaoth kor earring have composure<br />
protective sleeves have corporeal fury<br />
all phase 5 legs have aura of valor<br />
fiery crystal guard has 15 agi<br />
FoF losing sta, gaining 20 agi, FR changing to PR I believe<br />
<br />
Thats it off the top of my head</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Splaktar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Cool thanks for the quick reply and helpful info.<br />
<br />
Nice to see some AGL and CHA on gear.  I could care less if they remove from STA since I'm at like 390 STA atm.<br />
<br />
Most all of those seem useful and make sense so far... hopefully all of them are that good... and hopefully they do something with DBotW (make it 2h)...<br />
<br />
Also good to see some items w/o effects or w/ small effects get some more.  I know we almost had TT arms rot a few times cause no one wanted... and the Runewarded Belt only having Kick was pretty weak... hopefully some effect for Pauldrons of Devastation also...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Auron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The crap saryrn belt is getting Aura of Bravery I believe, and the soulclaw ring getting like 25cha or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Xocin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">dbotwl is getting 15 agi and 15 cha as well</div></div><hr />

Welcome to OS, this is where we discuss Time gear and stuff. Petty whining about Verant and class balance is at the Outhouse, this way ----&gt;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hate to burst your bubble but there are a lot of lvl 65 Overlords out there that are not in time.  This forum also talks about PoP Elemental.  That constitutes a lot of items, zones, players and warrior issues that are not in time.   <br />
<br />
The current imbalances that we see in the warrior class are universal to the game and reflected there as well.</div></div><hr />

Perhaps you should read the line underneath the title of this forum, and note that this isn't only a PoTime flagged warrior dick swinging forum.  K? Thx!<br />
<br />
This forum is for HIGH LEVEL warrior posting. It is heavily moderated to ensure it remains that way. PoP Elemental and Time discussion only, please.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Splaktar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Can you guys please Troll another forum?  Like the outhouse or War room?<br />
<br />
This thread is about Time item upgrades, nothing else.  Not about what you think about how they effect game balance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">^ what Splaktar said. Try to stay on topic, fellas.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Splaktar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Well Checked my stuff when I logged in:<br />
<br />
Helm of Flowing Time = Same<br />
Tier 1 loots = Same<br />
Runewarded Belt = Aura of Bravery, 10 CHA<br />
Guantlets of Disruption = Aura of Bravery, 15 AGL, 15 CHA<br />
Edge of Eternity = 18 AGL<br />
<br />
Overall gain for me: 51 AGL, 25 CHA, 6regen, 60 ATK.  Woo!  Finally maxed AGL w/ Haste, so no need for AGL buff to take up a slot anymore!<br />
<br />
<br />
From Guildmates:<br />
Greaves of Furious Might = Aura of Daring, 20 AGL<br />
Boots of Despair = Vengeance X, 20 AGL, 20 CHA<br />
Vanazir = Same<br />
Armguards of the Brute = Faerune, 20 CHA<br />
Earring of Xaoth Kor = Vengeance III, 15 AGL, 15 CHA<br />
Fiery Crystal Guard = 15 AGL<br />
Veil of Inferno = 20 AGL<br />
TZ Chain Boots = Faerune<br />
<br />
Guildmates gained a lot more... one something like 85 AGL 60CHA and 100+ ATK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gogo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Hmm... I guess no Faerune on Boots of Despair or Armguards of the Brute?<br />
<br />
The AGI and CHA upgrades you listed, did they get STA taken out of them?<br />
<br />
I am stuck at work... so please post other upgrades! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>KhalimBloodhelm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Someone just said Faerune on Armgaurds of the Brute, doofus.  Pay attention. =D<br />
<br />
Edit : OMG I just noticed!!<br />
<br />
Guantlets of Disruption = Aura of Bravery, 15 AGL, 15 CHA<br />
