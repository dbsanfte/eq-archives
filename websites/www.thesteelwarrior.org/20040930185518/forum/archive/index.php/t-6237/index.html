<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>uniad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">K been trying to work on this damn trial now for 3 weeks with no luck. Come to conclusion that u need 2 cleircs / 2 tanks / 2 high dps. Is there any other strategy to this trial or is it just hope you don't run out of mana and tanks don't die? Just wandering, this trial is driving me insane.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>aspit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">nope you pretty much figured it out</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I tank both bosses at the same time, with two clerics healing.  Last time we did it we had war, rogue, rogue, monk, cleric, cleric.  Clerics were pretty much oom at the end but it got it done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>uniad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">K will try this tonight and just try to keep agro on both mobs. Is it better to use melee dps or casters? Just wandering.<br />

My mob was the first one killed with the Druid healing me. The Cleric was healing our other tank. Use your disciplines wisely and you will win. <br />
<br />
This really is a fun encounter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>dethvegi1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">1war , 2 clerics, 1enc, 1nec, 1bst is the setup i've done it with.  This trial is really kind of a joke once you figure it out ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Although you can't split the two Priests, it is possible to not have everyone on both of their aggro lists.  <br />
<br />
Rotating invulnerability abilities works pretty well too, especially with melee.  Monks are ideal for this since they can just Whirlwind and then switch off to another guy.</div></div><hr />

hehe we just done trial 1...now attempting trial 2...am wondering abt what u said<br />
<br />
after disc down for monks...they can still carry on tanking though ?<br />
<br />
what makes this trial 2 &quot;&quot; easier &quot;&quot; than suposedly hardest &quot;trial 1&quot;  ? low hp for malevoent?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">lower hp, and they dont hit as hard and nothing to CC</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Monk tank 12 seconds with Furious and then FD to your designated next tank.  That's 12 seconds out of the 60-90 seconds you need to kill one of them taken care of.<br />
<br />
It is also possible to just tank them straight up too with 2 clerics + 2 tanks from what others said.  If you don't have as much healing/tanking you need to come up with something clever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Higelac_SZZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">lots of ways to win, easiest way is to go in with 1 war and riposte both with a high dmg 2h, then have another war go in and ae taunt and riposte with a high dmg 2h (both priests will be on 8ish% now) stonewall and kill, ez</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sorrowsong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">wat do u guys think of war clr dru enc rogue monk/bard setup . . <br />
was thinking monk/bard tanks 2nd named with whirlwind/invul ..FD/FM -- rogue takes over with nimble..escape....with both of them hittin on warrior's mob before warrior finally AE taunt.  any flaws in that plan?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">yeah, whats the point of an enchanter?<br />
<br />
We did War - SK - Bst - clr - clr - wiz (why do you even think about feeble dps like rog mnk? =P)<br />
<br />
SK HTs his mob, dps on that mob as well, burning it down, clerics doing a group CH rotation with 7.2 casting time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Torrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Beat this trial with one tank, one cleric, and a shaman for healing.  Rest was dps.  Cleric went in DA, brought them both to the middle of the two rooms, I area taunted, furied building aggro on both, and corner tanked both while stonewall.<br />
<br />
Hardest part of this trial is the boss summoning IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">war pal ench mage cleric cleric<br />
<br />
Wiped at pop (surprise)<br />
Wiped with 2nd named at 0% , first dead<br />
Won</div></div><hr />

I doubt guilds with warriors geared like you have a hard time beating ikkinz trials =P</div></div><hr />

Heh, he's still wearing several pieces of elemental gear, just has lots of AC augments and a shield of strife :p.</div></div><hr />
