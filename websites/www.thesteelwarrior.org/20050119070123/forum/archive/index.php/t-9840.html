<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hexus</div><div class="date">11-24-2004, 11:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've noticed an interesting trend in OoW that so far faction actually means something again (t1 quests, etc). I was actually extremely surprised once when someone trained a handful of mobs in MPG to the RS zone and then clicked the crystal leaving me standing in front of 3 mobs. On pure instinct I hit BDA on my warrior and DA'd on cleric, and was about to click into RS when I realized that none of the mobs was attacking me. After doing a quick con all 3 were dubious to both cleric and warrior, much to my surprise! Have since found out that both characters are completely non-KOS to every mob in PG (Which has made the need for paying close attention to invisibility in that zone trivial, thank god).<br />
<br />
Both characters have XP'd reguarly in RS since hitting 69, and I have gained roughly 200-225 AA in RS total, so this is the only rational explanation for this change. Does anyone else have any similar experiences or insights?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fynepisa</div><div class="date">11-24-2004, 11:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mobs in Riftseekers give a +Mata Muram hit which is what all the GoD model mobs are on. So you can get non-KoS to all the kyvs, aneuks, ukuns, etc.  If you check around you should still be kos to the discordling since they are on a different faction. <br />
<br />
You probably have noticed faction coming up when pulling which is often nice since the mobs across the different factions won't assist each other. Some examples of this are Discordling Enchainer Kuuron room, Elite Aneuk Miseryfiend, as well as being able to pull the chimeras right over the pyrilens.<br />
<br />
It's pretty cool that faction is useful. One thing I noticed though is that even with max Riftseekers faction, everything in RSS is still KoS. Has anyone found where this faction is useful?</div></div><hr />

Passed 2 discordling mobs on the way to RS and am positive they did not agro, so not entirely certain of they are dubious or not. Which faction are they on?<br />
<br />
Also, how will maxing this faction effect the encounter in CoA with Overlord Mata Muram?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fynepisa</div><div class="date">11-24-2004, 12:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Discordling are on Denizons of Discord faction. The lightning warriors are on Mata Muram even though there aren't any in GoD. I'm not sure why the discordling wouldn't be KoS. I personally am kos so I dunno, but I know they are on different faction because they don't assist the mata muram dudes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hexus</div><div class="date">11-24-2004, 12:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Depending on what faction the mobs are on in CoA (Especially including Overlord Mata Muram himself since he is the owner of the faction), it's quite possible that maxing that faction would allow an entire raid (or key individuals to CoH/CS) to bypass entire events in CoA if they are not keyed or tied in on some form of progression (As far as I know, all of the current named are simply in the way on a small path so they have to be killed for you to move along inside the zone).<br />
<br />
Opens up interesting questions, reminds me of getting an ally Mage for doing Royals back in Chardok days.</div></div><hr />
