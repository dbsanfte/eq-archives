Im sure she was twinked seriously seeing that she had a split blade in her off hand.  if you all could add comments and suggestions i'd appreciate it.  I did tank BoT 4-way last night with ease, did have slower.  next upgrade will be replacing the hoop of dark spirits with blood earring of rage.</div></div><hr />

LDoN armor has nice stats and some would be a big upgrade for you in some slots.<br />

If you are worried about AC I can't recommend the 10 AC augs from BB enough--for 510 points.</div></div><hr />

I'd reccomend: level, get your hp AA and head to EF ldons.  You'll want anger augnments eventually, and the plate armor there is pretty close to ornate armor level.</div></div><hr />

Most of the gear I have you can get in the Bazaar...Ornate is expensive, I didn't buy that and if your spending money for it there are better things you can buy...but you might get some upgrade ideas.</div></div><hr />
