<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>brutall</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This is taken from future plans at the eqlive websight<br />
<br />
We're still planning to take a look at improving the damage capabilities of melee classes, as they've fallen behind their magic-using counterparts at the very high end of the game.  Finding the proper solutions for this situation will take some time.  Some options being considered are:<br />
<br />
Improve melee damage-increasing disciplines <br />
Improve Planes of Power melee weapons <br />
<br />
At the &quot;very high end of the game&quot; every single melee is at their innate ATK cap.  It seems like it would be easier to raise the atk cap then it would be to revamp every weapon in the database. <br />
 <br />
1) It would also make some of the items droping have more value. <br />
<br />
2) This would go a long way to corrrecting the obvious problem with elemental melee armor.<br />
<br />
3) Could acheive their origional goal of improving melee damage<br />
<br />
I'm unsure if archery damage from rangers would need to be adjusted but aside from that I'd much rather have this solution then the ones suggested.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Chatja ogre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Raising ATK cap would probably help a good deal. Depends how they would code it I guess. If 100 atk meant 10% more dps, it would be a step in the right direction</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Raising the melee damage to compete with caster dmg is an obvious need.<br />
It's pretty retarded that they only think now that a wizard doing 4 times more dps then a rogue, isn't very balanced.<br />
<br />
But i dont see how they want to fix that now...<br />
if all the melee had a fair augmentation in dps, a lot of encounters will be suddenly unbalanced.<br />
<br />
AND, <br />
it's not going to help the fact that all we do all day long is /disc defensive, Taunt, Kick, Disarm :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>aakla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">problem is that all of the items in Time are +strikethrough and stuff, no atk buffs. so full time armor will be lower atk then full raex right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chatja ogre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Probably, Aakla.<br />
<br />
I dont think wizards do 4 times the dps of a rogue. A guild rogue did 259 dps on bertox today :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Torrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Melee damage is the last thing they should be increasing.  Do you guys even parse your fights?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Wilhelmm_Lanys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Warrior damage perhaps not. with a BoW, from my knowledge, combined with our outstanding offensive AA's (we really got lucky here I think), our damage output is fine. Which is exactly why warriors are concerned, since this &quot;melee&quot; change will most likely affect only monks + rogues. The fact that they refuse to tackle the taunt issue is a clear sign that they indicate no desire to &quot;fix&quot; warriors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">For a BoW 300AA  Vengeace 41 warrior i  have ZERO complains about my DPS.<br />
<br />
Wether that may be &quot;Potential DPS&quot; or &quot;Actual DPS'<br />
<br />
That is compared to other melee classes under normal &amp; optimal conditions.<br />
<br />
Compared to casters, i would like to get a small boost indeed.<br />
But we must remember that lowest DPS classes will need the highest boost.<br />
Else % wise they will get shafted (paladins &amp; us mostly).<br />
<br />
If we exclude TS (situational) high end raid DPS actually look like :<br />
<br />
1) Rogue<br />
2) SK (with HT &amp; Disc if the fight is really short)<br />
3) Monk (or Ranger with archery)<br />
4) Ranger (without archery)<br />
5) War (or SK without HT &amp; Disc on normal fights)<br />
6) Paladin<br />
<br />
With SK going above rogue on very regular basis on -3 mins fights.<br />
You cant even grasp the damage a (FT5 + VoQ + ID4) SK dishes</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Rumblingdeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">And again I call SK broken, to good at damage doing for a tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Torrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I would agree with Furor that the Blade of War is an overpowered weapon.  However if they did worsen the ratio, they sure as hell better increase the proc rate, because DPS is what makes it taunt so well.<br />
<br />
People are gauging their DPS against BoW equipped warriors, and crying about how little damage they do.  In my opinion, the only melee upgrades anyone needs are a slight increase for monks.<br />
<br />
SK damage on certain fights is very high with HT.  No 1 per minute bullshit, manaless 7k manaburns.  I don't quite parse mine above well-equipped monks without HT, but they certainly do rank up there.<br />
<br />
Trueshot under certain conditions is insane.  One of my rangers parsed a 450 DPS run-- on Reparm of all mobs.  He has an extremely fast machine and uses a gamepad.  Hes not even that well equipped.  He also happens to be an ex-wizard, heh.  Otherwise I would agree that archery is monk-level damage, w/o disc.  Although I'm not sure I'd want to see archery nerfed that badly, since cornering mobs is required for many fights.  They can suffer from the disc problem like we do :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">SK gets a 40DPS &quot;invisible boost&quot; from spells.<br />
(Thats high dps, low casting time spells, that number is actually<br />
60-70DPS, but i take off 20-30 due to lost swings)<br />
I'm not counting critics or imbued innate procs.<br />
<br />
4-7K Manaburn is insane. <br />
Specially if u consider the 3min refresh on the 4K part.<br />
(Take a death, in 3 mins your GTG with HT up again)<br />
<br />
I am very confindent (actually convinced) a fully elemental SK<br />
Sews + V50 + AA + ID4  will beat a BoW+V50+AA non tanking<br />
warrior on every single &quot;normal&quot; parse you make.<br />
Thats either trash mobs, or long fights.<br />
<br />
<br />
On very very short fights (Fire / Coirnav) SK probably rank among the 1st.<br />
As the duration increases (Every other mob) they drop down<br />
to &quot;a bit better than warrior&quot; level.<br />
<br />
Of course no one even comes close to a TS ranger.<br />
But thats another story :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Torrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">You can see other's direct spell damages now.  The latest EQCompanion supports it too.<br />
<br />
I am also sure a well played SK with a SEWS could match BoW DPS.  Hell, in exp groups they can make pets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Redcloud</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I'm trying to find out what is the real DPS for each class in a typical EP raid.<br />
<br />
Does any MT managed to parse all classes consistently to have an average value for each?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Melee damage is the last thing they should be increasing. Do you guys even parse your fights? <br />
<br />
Boy, your wizards must suck :p<br />
A Wizard can easily go over twice the dps of a rogue.<br />
<br />
And i don't see how BoW is over powered.<br />
Imo, its all the other warrior weapons that are a bit underpowered.<br />
<br />
One of the bonuses warriors are SUPPOSE to get for being incredibly dependent and sucky at aggro.. is more DPS.<br />
Yet we hardly get better then knights... unless we're wielding a BoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>aspit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">i do about 190 dps in pofire tanking, thats with fa sov sot sotp, our rogues do about 230 with ifir/khal off, our monks hit about 190ish with reparm 2hb, 160ish with caens 170 rbb.  Our sks are at about 130ish exping with lance of the flame knight and rangers hit about 170ish with sews.  This is exping and doesnt take virtually useless long refresh attacks like death touch into consideration.  One of the easiest upgrades they could do for exp instances would be to make proced avatar not count as worn.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Torrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Yes, I hear that sometimes.  My wizards suck.  Of course, those people have yet to ever show me any parses.<br />
<br />
DPS readings for casters is worthless without considering duration.  I can wait until a mob is 50%, cast strike of solusek, then cast another immediately, and have parsers read 700 DPS.  In order to accurately measure caster contribution, you need to look at total sum damages.<br />
<br />
However, for a moment, lets just pretend nukes have no aggro (hah) and chain cast Strike of Solusek.  Assuming focus speeding thought, maximum spell haste AAs, zero latency (impossible), no resists (laugh), and an average nuke of 115% (fury of ro focus), that would be 370 DPS.  With full crit AAs, damage increases about another 20%.  Thats 444 DPS.  Hardly &quot;easily twice the dps of a rogue&quot;<br />
<br />
Last night I parsed a rogue over the course of 72 seconds do 290 DPS on the Avatar of Earth.  This rogue wields the dagger off of Solusek. (i.e. not the best)  This rogue beat the highest wizard in damage by about 500.  The wizard had pants and connected with 6 full damage strikes of solusek, and crit once.  That is hardly &quot;sucking&quot;<br />
<br />
Don't look blindly at the DPS number your parser spits out.  Consider all the variables.<br />
<br />
edit: typo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>kriegartorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">actually... with max spell haste focus, AA, and BoR i think SoS gets down to 4.8 seconds cast time...  using ur spell assumptions:<br />
<br />
cast time + 2 second recast time = 6.8 seconds<br />
<br />
1.15 with damage focus = 3151 <br />
<br />
dps : 3151/6.8 =  463<br />
<br />
thats with no crits... but then again thats assuming no agro/resists at all...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Solinar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">i do about 190 dps in pofire tanking, thats with fa sov sot sotp<br />
<br />
I fully believe you do 190 DPS on some fights, but Im afraid I dont believe you do 190 DPS on average.  Thats a lot of ATK (prolly around 2k Im guessing depending on your gear), but 190 Average means your often pushing 230 or more on some fights, and 150 on other fights.  Thats just a bit too high for the current line up of warrior weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>aspit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">For the most part pve wise i think pure melees are in good shape, although monks could use a small dps boost, pvp however they are by far the worst classes in the game and need a huge upgrade.  190 dps isnt very tough with a blade of war of sews.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Mourningloree</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Depends on how the DPS is calculated, a lot of DPS calculators my own included count the damage shield as damage.  And let's not forget 30% overhaste if this tanking is with a bard.  Running ~170 sustained DS and 30% overhaste it's easy to hit 190 constant and burst to 230 DPS with a BoW.  But is that really 190 DPS? No, not really...</div></div><hr />
