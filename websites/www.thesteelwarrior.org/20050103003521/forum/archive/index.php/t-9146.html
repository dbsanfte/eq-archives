Did a search on boards...didnt see any other threads about this AA and wanted to see if others have this same issue.  I tested it on ice giant while waiting on epic guy and I went -33 fell down and druid heals me and then I get the message &quot;Druid was slain you&quot;.  I didnt lose any xp from this death, but is this a bug?  Anyone else test this?</div></div><hr />

do you mean that you died after druid's heal instead of getting conscious again or that it was just a wrong message or something else ...</div></div><hr />

I bought one level of delay death and the first day I had it I was it said I was slain by &quot;insert bards name&quot; who was just singing ae hp/mana.

I mean, regularly you can go purple (before this AA) and you wouldn't loose aggro.

<br />
Was suiciding on a low level mob to get some items from bank,  Kept going unconscious for a few hits, then standing up.<br />
<br />
The only &quot;bug&quot; I see with the aa is that if I go unconscious when I die, it keeps my camera in 3rd person after zoning</div></div><hr />

On big boss mobs it requires them to do 250 more damage to you to kill you, therefore, it is like half of sturdiness (250hp), for only 15aa instead of 60aa of full sturdi(500hp)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">09-28-2004, 02:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's true...essentially it adds 250hp, except it doesn't add it to the hp total, just how far you can go under 0 before you actually die.  That's a pretty large restriction that really makes it not worth as much as Sturdiness (AA-wise), but you never know just when a mob will get lucky and that extra 250hp will save your life/group/raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">09-28-2004, 03:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's no difference whether 250 HP is to your total or your purple bar.  Say I have 10K HP and 250 purple HP, I can take 10249 damage before I die, and I can potentially be healed for 10249.  This is exactly the same as if I had just 10250 HP outright.  Being in purple doesn't seem to affect mitigation/avoidance at all (stuff can miss even if you're on the ground unconscious).  The only difference is that in the first case I won't be able to attack when I hit purple (ignoring any bugs that may cause a premature death) so I have slightly less aggro but presumably you don't stay purple for very long.</div></div><hr />

thats how I look at it, until I put it to the test, in a duel and using my manastone once, its broken and doesn't work, you die almost instantly when falling under 0%. This is bull and they need to A. reimburse the aa's spent for it or B. REIMBURSE THE AA'S SPENT! or C. FIX IT, and give people the choice to rebuy it like they did with press the attack.</div></div><hr />

10000 hp.<br />
85% DMG (8500)<br />
DI Check with 1500hp left until Death.<br />
<br />
10000hp <br />
85% DMG (8500)<br />
DI Check with 1500+150hp left until Death<br />
<br />
10150hp<br />
85% DMG (8627.5)<br />
DI Check with 1522hp left until Death<br />
<br />
So while you still have &quot;More HP left before death&quot; after the DI check.<br />
You realise it kinda sucks.<br />
<br />
Having 150 more hp means you will have to take 128 more dmg  to get that DI check.<br />
Having 150 FD/hp means you have a wider margin after the DI check.<br />
<br />
150HP AA = I need to take 8628DMG to get that DI check<br />
150HP/FD AA = I need to take 8500DMG to get that DI check <br />
<br />
And anyone will agree, that avoiding DI checks, is a lot better than having a bigger margin after it is done.</div></div><hr />

Actually you gain full damage and lower combat skill check rate if you unconscious. I think it makes some different.</div></div><hr />

I know I don't get hit for 6 every hit when a large rat knocked me to purple back in newbie days because then you'd be dead in two hits instead of watching your life slowly go down.  I have never heard of any condition that reduces defense skills partially.  Maybe you can't riposte/dodge/parry because of facing issues.</div></div><hr />

Aye.  I remember way back in the day soloing in Blackburrow, I had this incredibly close fight with a gnoll.  Both down to a sliver, he knocked me unconsious and procceeded to wiff over and over till I regened enough to pop back up and get in a swing.  Then he hit me again and back to purple I went.  He continued to miss me again until I finally popped up a second time and delivered the killing blow to him.  Was crazy nerve wracking.  &quot;I'm fucked&quot;... &quot;Oh no I'm not!&quot;... &quot;Nope, I am indeed screwed&quot;... &quot;Holy shit!&quot;.</div></div><hr />

So isn't 250 hp at the back end of your hp bar less effective than what  250 hp at the front would do?  I understand that hp are hp, but certainly if that's the case, it looks like they've found a way to shaft you guys even more &gt;&lt;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Incorrect, HP isn't HP.  This is HP which is entirely (as in 100% of it) under 25% of your HP, meaning it's 250 HP of mobs frenzying on you, and when you get low HP aggro with multiple mobs around you're kinda doomed anyways.  A real 250 HP would be 188 hp of non low hp aggro with an additional 62 of non low hp aggro which is more beneficial than what that AA is.  As you can see that effectiveness is reflected in the low cost.<br />
<br />
Oh, I have no levels in this AA and got purple clubbed 4 times on Chailak a couple weeks ago (then promptly slaughtered by a 20k of gayness).</div></div><hr />

Yup, completely true.  The only way this AA could be made useful is if it acted as a feign.  But then, it would be way overpowered for the cost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">10-13-2004, 03:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's definitely worthwhile for raid tanks.  For a MT on a raid there's always a heal coming, and aa that lets you survive a round that would have killed you is very worthwhile since warriors tend to die 3ms befor a heal lands just about every time on raids.  Low health aggro is meaningless for a warrior, they have aggro whether they're low health or not, or they should anyway.</div></div><hr />

While a fully buffed MT will have maybe 15k hp, his DI will only trigger in the 0-2250 hp range(its 15% right? forgot the exact percentage). So extending the DI trigger range downwards so its -250 to 2250hp definately seems worthwhile to me. That is assuming its working though :)</div></div><hr />

I don't think anyone would dispute that 250 more hps would be more useful, but I still see this as a very worthwhile AA to get, and it will be one of the first that I buy from OoW.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can see how it would suck for other classes though since they may be a knight off tanking where frenzy aggro will cause other mobs to come to them, or another who got low health aggro from an AE and now the main mob turns around and starts smacking them.</div></div><hr />

With an extra 250 HP there is now a slim chance they might survive.<br />
<br />
And it's not that hard to get enough aggro to overcome frenzy anyway, not to mention you can now stun a lot of trash which would prevent them from frenzying on someone at least for a little bit.</div></div><hr />

Sturdi 1: 100hps / 4aa = 25hp/aa<br />

Sturdi 5: 100hps / 20aa= 5hp/aa<br />

Every level of Delay death is 50hp / 3aa = 16.66hp/aa<br />

Sooooo....<br />
<br />
Sturdiness1&gt;DelayDeath1-5&gt;Sturdiness2-5<br />
<br />
Get sturdi 1, then Delay death 1-5, then finish off sturdiness (when just analyzing the two)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Reason being is I have to consider that in normal situations (meaning, not tanking a big bad boss) the cleric is going to start healing me at a certain % of HP and wont be taking into account my Delay Death levels. So, Sturdi improves mana efficiency a little.<br />
<br />
But, that said, I decided on sturdi 2, DD 5, sturdi 5 =)<br />

You can argue it backwards too, saying that since those 250 HP are &quot;hidden&quot; from the cleric, it is a shock absorber from a cleric miscalculation of when to start the heal. If they were visible HP, the cleric would just start the heal later, thus negating the cushion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tinguran</div><div class="date">10-29-2004, 12:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Delay Deaths hidden hp will not refresh from a full heal, as would sturdies.  IE you have 9K HP with strudy 5, each time you get a full heal thats 500 hp you wouldnt have had.  You dont get that advantage with DD.  So sturdy has alot more value than DD.<br />
<br />
DD does help midigate the damage spike that most of us end up dieing to on large mobs.  So as long as the aa is working it looks like it has merit.   Just something else to throw aa at.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daabu</div><div class="date">10-29-2004, 05:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dont understand what you're trying to say Tinguran.<br />
<br />
If you have 9k hp and DD5, you can take 9260dmg before you die.  If you take 9259dmg and get a complete heal (with healing focus that actually heals over 9k), then you will be at max hp again.  All 9259dmg taken will be healed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Let's say hypothetically you could have 10000 HP and 0 HP bar on purple, or 1 HP and 9999 purple HP bar, and let us assume for the moment your group doesn't care you can't attack 99% of the time or hold aggro.  We'll assume the cleric can heal 10K with CH.<br />
<br />
In the first case, if you're still alive then a heal will heal anywhere between 0 and 9999 HPs.<br />
<br />
In the second case, you'd probably be on the floor all the time, and a heal will heal anywhere between 1 and 9999 HPs.<br />
<br />
The only argument is if the purple HP becomes so much that it misleads people into thinking you've much less HP than you really do and start healing early.  Otherwise, there is no difference at all.</div></div><hr />

I didnt notice a patch message, but sometime this week, I started getting purple clubbed.  Ive been purple clubbed 5 times this week and lived.  Just wanted to pass along that it is now fixed and ready to buy.  <br />
<br />
On a side note, I hear all the talk about its usefulness, I saved myself 5 deaths / wipes this week alone from this AA and thats what matters to me.  I dont think there is any doubt that this AA, when operational, is a good thing.  As far as Sturd vs. DD, just bust ass and get them both asap, they are both what helps us do our job.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is really good to know.  Lets say you are on a raid mob, and he hits you, and drops you to -229.  Imagine there are 5 other warriors, all well and capable of surviving a round of damage w/o a heal, so they are perfectly fine to take the agro while you are purpled...<br />
<br />
Now, you have from the point you get purpled to either the raid wipes or you regen to 1HP, or recieve a heal before you die...<br />
<br />
So, its just not that its a split-second of extra life, its possibly many tics of living waiting for a heal, with the mob not paying attention to you.<br />
<br />
Also, say you aren't the MT, this would be useful as well, especially if you get rampaged and dont have a healer, or drawn agro and it takes a while to get the CH rot on you.</div></div><hr />

sure, if someone is close behind you on the hate liste, the few seconds you stop swinging (thus generate zero aggro) let her take the lead on the hate list if she doen't step back. But I remember when soloing, When I was purpled, the only way to stop being hit was either being dead or another PC getting on the hate liste and being closer to the mob and having generated large aggro.</div></div><hr />
