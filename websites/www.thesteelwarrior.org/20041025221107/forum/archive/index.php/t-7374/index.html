<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, I know that I want to shoot for +shielding first. But what order of importance for everything else? Should I even bother to make anything other than shielding a priority?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kilzalot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Avoidance and Combat effects are nice too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Angry_Tank01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The question I'm pondering atm is:<br />
<br />
Quarm cloak (4% shielding) vs Rallos Cloak (10% Avoidance)<br />
<br />
I was told shielding caps at 20% (?), and can personally find 31% shielding in game (that you could wear at once), anyone confirm the 20% cap ?  If so you should think about shielding items in avoidance item slots.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't actively work towards anything but Shielding, unless you have an endless supply of DKPs, you'll just pickup random effects on high level items anyway.  Depending on your loot system it may be harder/easier for tanks to pickup shielding items, we don't restrict shielding items to tanks, however it's strongly encouraged.<br />
<br />
Strikethrough is quite funky, and Stun resist never hurt to get, SpellShield is nice if you're not MA and getting hit by AEs without a CHC ;)  Combat effects are good, but wouldn't sacrifice better stats on other items to go for CE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Naubi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">10 avoidance is supposedly ~ 4% shielding in terms of reduction in damage taken. If you wanted to compare two items.<br />
<br />
Avoidance damage reduction is more random of course tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">No Naubi, thats for Quarm only based on Aspits numbers.<br />
<br />
Imo :<br />
<br />
1) Shielding (Soaking up DMG is our main role)<br />
2) Avoidance (Loses interest on high Hit Rate mobs, specially GoD)<br />
<br />
3) Spellshield  (You should have a mediocre SS value, and a full SS set).<br />
<br />
<br />
ATM I have 18% Shielding 0 Avoidance 0 Spellshield  (no inkkiz ring yet)<br />
<br />
My goal is : 27% Shielding 35 Avoidance 5% Spellshield.<br />
<br />
And having a 23% SS confing (Inkkiz Ring &amp; SS Augment + TZ Shield + KT shawl)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Striketrought : Useless we are not a DPS class<br />
Combat Effects : Great , but severely gimped because of WE &amp; Linearity<br />
Cleave : Useless we are not a  DPS class<br />
<br />
Same goes for all GoD focuses if you ask me :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Derrict</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Accuracy: every +5 = 0.333% hit increase .. for those DPS warriors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Timmok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Avoidance (Loses interest on high Hit Rate mobs, specially GoD)<br />
I havent followed this forum so close lately, got any links to parses showing that?<br />
<br />
It would seem to me that logically avoidance is still pretty attractive, IF the rule of thumb someone once posted still holds true, that +10 avoidance = 1% more misses. <br />
<br />
At least for Qvic/Inktuta trash, min hit seems to be what, 200-something? In that case I would probably prefer 10 avoidance over say 4% shielding. <br />
<br />
Personally I have focused mostly on avoidance(up to 35 now) since I pull alot. Its nice being able to pull something, run back to camp and stand behind MA, take maybe 4 misses and agro is on MA, and then back out pulling again without having to wait for heals.<br />
<br />
But if in doubt, just get both shielding/avoidance. Thats my plan eventually anyway hehe. So far the only spot where I had to make a choice was avoidance or shielding cloak, and that choice made itself since we hadnt beaten quarm back when i got my avoidance cloak.<br />
<br />
With the barrage of rain AEs in Qvic/Inktuta, spellshield is also beginning to look very attractive. I wonder if that is the case for Txevu as well. However, I have been putting spellshield a bit on the backburner for now. My logic is along the lines: <br />
<br />
Sure having 20-25% spellshield would make me personally, a stronger character. But usually for AEs what matters is the lowest common denominater. So it wont really have any impact on our raids, if I have 20-25% spellshield, if the support crew(casters/clerics/recent apps etc) only have 4-5% ss. Of course bosses that proc DDs on MTs alone would break this argument, but so far they seem pretty far between.<br />
<br />
In general I would say gear choices have become pretty complex lately, especially with the new and (unparsed?) improved dodge/parry line entering the scene as well. Quite a puzzle to max out all of shielding/avoidance/spellshield/dodge/parry/ATK at the same time :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">High hit rate mobs make avoidance less attractive because if you think about it, if you mob never miss you, then avoiding 1% hits reduce the DPS you take by 1%.  However, if mob only hits you 50% of the time, going from 50% to 49% is 2% DPS reduced.  So far high to-hit is more empirical observation (minus the notable Kyv never miss types that are easily verifiable) but it certainly seems like mobs are becoming more accurate to compensate for player power.<br />
<br />
The way I look at spellshield is the opposite.  If I don't need as much heals on AEs then that leaves the healers extra mana to heal the lowest geared people.  <br />
<br />
I'm sitting at 16% shielding and 31% spellshield with 5 avoidance and I'm pretty happy with the way my gear works.  Could've got another 4% shielding + 10 avoidance or 0% shielding + 20 avoidance but not horribly concerned about maxing out every possible modifier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">According to Aspit +10 Avoidance =  - 1 % Raw on hit rate.  That translates into :<br />
<br />
Get 20 Avoidance :<br />
A mob hitting 100% of the time, will now hit you 98% of the Time : 2% DPS Decrease<br />
A mob hitting 50% of the time, will now hit you 48% of the Time : 4% DPS Decrease<br />
A mob hitting 2% of the time, will now hit you 0% of the Time : 100% DPS Decrease<br />
<br />
Now of course there is no real data, exept what aspit gave us.<br />
And what maybe some monks parsed a long long time ago.<br />
<br />
As for shielding its the oposite.<br />
The harder the mob min hit, the more often it hits, the better shielding is.<br />
<br />
Of course its all theoretical data. In the end you want Shieldind &amp; Avoidance.<br />
So moot point. And if i remember well monks saw a kind of softcap on avoidance.<br />
<br />
But i sure got the feeling GoD mobs hit a LOT more than PoTime gods.<br />
<br />
<br />
In theory Avoidance &gt; Shielding.<br />
<br />
But to my eyes knowing every time i get hit i soak up 100hp off the hit.<br />
Is far more important &amp; reliable than getting hit less often.<br />
I am a defensive freak, and shielding helps a lot on the part def doesnt reduce.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shaiel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If every 10 Avoidance translates into -1% on the hit rate, it will always translate into 1% DPS decrease.<br />
<br />
Get 20 Avoidance :<br />
A mob hitting 100% of the time, will now hit you 98% of the Time : 2% DPS Decrease<br />
A mob hitting 50% of the time, will now hit you 49% of the Time : 2% DPS Decrease<br />
A mob hitting 2% of the time, will now hit you 1.96% of the Time : 2% DPS Decrease<br />
<br />
However, this example is still flawed.  Are you only getting hit for 50% of the time due to the mob's hit-rate, or for other reasons?  I depends on where, when, and how the Avoidance is taken into the calculation.<br />
<br />
That said, I'm not so sure it's as simple as 10 Avoidance always = 1% fewer hits taken.  Some mobs will hit you more often than others.  It's unlcear whether or not Avoidance will affect all mobs equally.  My guess is it does not.  On average and as a simple rule of thumb it's probably fairly accurate, though.<br />
<br />
As far as shielding versus avoidance goes, I'll always tend to favor shielding.  Shielding is a sure and consistent thing you can always count on in both the short and long run.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Hinanek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Combat effects and Avoidance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Daabu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">What exactly does Combat Effects do?  Increase dodge/parry/riposte/defense?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Procs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>aspit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Which is better in regard to shielding or avoidance really depends on your own personal parses.  If you have ever taken an economics course envision the supply demand curve as a shielding/avoidance curve.  Where at one end of the spectrum there is a mob that avoidance dominates, and on the other end shielding dominates.  At the center is a breakeven point, which for quarm as i posted before is about 10 avoidance = 4 shielding.  You would have to do this for each individual mob since each mob will have its own seperate curve based on innate hit rate ( which should be fairly constant, i havent parsed any god mobs yet but i can only assume), and mobs damage bonus.  Mobs with a higher damage bonus make shielding relatively more effective, as the effect cuts a higher amount based on raw damage off of what you are taking.  A mob with a relatively low db would make avoidance far more desireable as the shielding effect does less and less as the mobs db shrinks.  Again its very easy to calculate a break even for avoidance and shielding based on a parse of a mob.  All you need is a damage bonus, an average hit, and a hit%.  Also remember that any avoidance lessens the benefit of shielding, as you are getting hit less, so remember to take that into consideration.<br />
<br />
Edit:  You could make a chart with shielding and avoidance on the y axis and mob damage bonus on the x axis.  Obviously this would ignore the effect of higher hit rate but it would give you a rough estimate of which is more effective vs a certain mob.  You could then do the base calculations for each values and connect the dots forming 2 overlayed curves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>chidder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">If any aviodence lowers the benifit of sheilding then by nature any sheilding has to lower the benifit of aviodence so that's a not so important point. I think a balance of sheilding and aviodence would be best but aviodence items for warriors are harder to find than sheilding. Seems like sony wanys rog/monk/ranger to have avoidence while warriors to have sheilding</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>AragmarBB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">If any aviodence lowers the benifit of sheilding then by nature any sheilding has to lower the benifit of aviodence so that's a not so important point.<br />
Nah, avoiddance is done at the time of the hit either you are or you aren't<br />
Shielding affects how much you get hit for after you get hit or not.<br />
So if you avoid the hit (due to avoiddance defense or ac) shielding doesn't come into play. Thats why its affected.<br />
If avoiddance of any sort fails and you get hit, then shielding works.<br />
It doesnt work vice versa of each other.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>chidder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">yes but if you fail aviodence check and the sheilding makes the failure of that aviodence check less damage therefore the aviodence check is not worth as much in potential damage reduction</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>aspit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">yes but if you fail aviodence check and the sheilding makes the failure of that aviodence check less damage therefore the aviodence check is not worth as much in potential damage reduction<br />
<br />
<br />
If shielding checked before avoidance you would be 100% correct, but avoidance checks before the damage calc, so it really only works one way.  If a mob misses you an extra 3% of the time from avoid 30 thats 3% that shielding does not get a chance to check on.  If the mob hits, then avoidance fails and shielding checks, however if you had avoidance 0 the mob would hit regardless and shielding would check, so it really isnt effected by shielding.<br />
<br />
Think of it as avoidance is 100% independant of shielding, but shielding is dependant on avoidance since avoidance can cause additional misses before shielding were to check.</div></div><hr />

they said the same about hp items above 125 no?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Presumably stuff like improved parry breaks the cap otherwise they wouldn't need to put them in the first place.<br />
<br />
I don't see any game design mechanism against having stuff like say Improved Taunt 1/2/3 items that gives say 1/2/3% more chance to taunt, stackable.  Now whether it's balanced, that's another question.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">they said the same about hp items above 125 no?That's why there were no items with over 125hp until SoL, when they significantly revamped the game engine and item database.<br />
<br />
There is no reason that they can't add a modifier that would change the % of taunt success, but that is not the same as a modifier that increases the skill level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Daabu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">They would only have to change two things to allow taunt to break 252 -- the tank's class function of taunt, and add a private local variable called taunt_overcap.<br />

When is it more beneficial to use equipment tuned for an evasive tanking style vs when is it more beneficial to use an equipment set tuned for a defensive tanking style.  Somehow I get this strange feeling that someday down the road, we'll all be running around with a set of dodge/parry/avoidance gear for evasive tanking mobs, and a set of high ac/shielding gear for defensive mobs.</div></div><hr />

if you are refering to the Boots of Despair from Time, they have a +10% mod to Taunt... which would take you from 230 to 253 (over the cap).  <br />
<br />
230*0.10 = 23<br />
23+230 = 253</div></div><hr />

The older warriors amoung us will remember there was a hat, a random drop in Greig's, which brought up the question of whether +taunt items had any effect. I remember reports from fan fayre that taunt is specifically treatedly differently from other skills in that it's hardcapped at 230, not 252. I believe there was a specific followup from SoE that concurred the +taunt cap offered no change to warriors.<br />
<br />
Unless there's been updated information since that I've missed, I've had no reason to change my view</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">There are skills that do not improve, such as Mend, after a certain number.  I recall SoE stating this was one of them, something along the lines of 'even if Taunt was raised to 252 the game already treats 230 as the highest skill level'.  <br />
<br />
So taunt probably goes to 252, the question is that does going to 252 actually have any effect?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">DoT shielding is pretty useless at the moment.  There's either the dots that can kill you, where it needs to be cured or you die (like say Vision of Pain) unless you have like 50% dot shielding (and no one does), and then there's dots that don't do anything to you.  For dot shielding to matter you need a good amount of decent sized dots at around 200-500/tick range with a reasonable duration (say 2 minutes) and not easily cured (poison/disease/curse 99 counters is not unreasonable if recast is reasonable).</div></div><hr />
