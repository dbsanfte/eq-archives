<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bardeil</div><div class="date">07-13-2004, 06:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Have you tried one yet? I tanked my first one WAY before your stats. Something like 6000/1150 buffed and no defensive aa. Get a crew of people you know and tell them you want to try and give it a shot. The power group for a hard ldon in my opinion looks something like war/clr/enc/mnk/rng/shm but theres lots of room for variation in there. Good single pulls, cc, and dps are more important than sheer tanking power in hard ldon unless you're trying to pull a gimp cleric through. <br />
<br />
My stats are barely better than yours and the last few hards I did seemed downright easy, our biggest problem was keeping the killrate high enough with people going LD etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">07-13-2004, 06:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">With your stats it's doable, if you have LR5/ID5 it's very doable.  Pulling and CC are the key factors.  With about the same stats (roughly 5500 hps and 1300ish AC unbuffed), LR3 and no ID, I tanked an unslowed hard ldon mob.  The cleric was oom after but the mob was dead and I wasn't.  Once you get to the point where you're hitting 7.5k or better buffed hps and between 1350 and 1400 ac,  it all comes down to supporting cast.  And most critical of all is pulling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lathen</div><div class="date">07-13-2004, 06:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A few weeks ago wiith 5.9k hps/1300 AC after buffs and only 12 or so AA's, I got my skinny half-elf ass handed to me on a platter in an LDoN hard. Supporting cast consisted of a clr, enc, dru, mag, and bst, all level 65.<br />
<br />
After 4 mobs and god knows how many complete heals, we called the show and got a normal difficulty adventure. It was not pretty.</div></div><hr />

You should have no problem at all mate, only reason my adv didn't win was A) our cleric was lousy (I died once, mob beat on me 20 seconds and she didn't even cast a heal, healed myself 3 times before I died lol, and she wasn't afk) and B) DPS was nonexistant (61 wizard, 64 druid, 65 Ranger [tank] was our wonderful DPS).... Anyways, you shouldn't have much problem at all with a skilled group :)</div></div><hr />

What does your 5.1k hps/1330 AC buff up to? I also see that you've got 334 AA's. At the time I tried, I had about 12 or so, and none of them were in CA or CS.<br />
<br />
So ---- I agree! With 5.1k hps and 1330 AC unbuffed and 334 AA's, I WILL be able to tank LDoN hards with no problems!<br />

You can tank hard, but the rest of your group has to be 'better geared' than you to compensate.<br />
<br />
Short answer, yes you can tank it, but you need the rest of your group to be better geared than you to compensate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">07-13-2004, 07:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kailyn,<br />
<br />
I see you have CA3/CS3/LR5/ID5/ND3/PD3/PE1 and dual Anger 3 augments, and I'm guessing you can buff to about 8.2k and 1500 AC with tribute and leadership.  In my opinion, you are ready for Hard LDON.<br />
<br />
The question is whether the rest of your group is ready.  Hopefully they all have their level 65 spells, Spellcasting Subtlety AA, at least a few points of FT and mana saving AA's, and ideally they'd all have LR5 regardless of class.<br />
<br />
In many ways, Hard LDON is more intense for the other classes than it is for the warrior.  Hard LDON is the closest thing most people can get to a GoD trial without actually going to GoD.  Mana usage and aggro generation are intense.  Indecision is costly.  Mistakes with pulling/runners/gaters are generally catastrophic.  Classes need to use all of their tools, even those that are raid-oriented, like Divine Intervention and Fortitude.<br />
<br />
I would strongly encourage you to buy Weapon Affinity, at least to level 2 or 3 (hopefully you have GoD).  WA is a huge asset for fights such as Hard LDON, where your early aggro will save or cost lives.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Carnatus</div><div class="date">07-13-2004, 07:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The bottom line is the triple 990 is what they hit the &quot;squishy&quot; folks for.  I am 65, dont have squat for AA and not the stats you have and I tank hards all the time.  With normal, barely enhanced mitigation I only get hit for 800+ once in a while, the bulks is below 500 and many are below 200... my grandma hits harder than that...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">07-13-2004, 08:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">LDoNs aren't the best XP out there so most people doing LDoNs are there to grind points.  You get to a stage where you have done 10-15 adventures in each theme and the novelty value is pretty much gone and now you are just there to get your 1150 points together for another 40hps or 1400points for another bit of gear or whatever.  Once you are doing the adventures just to grind away points and you are faced with a choice of 45mins, 51 points guarenteed vs 60-90mins for 105 but with alot of risk its pretty rare that they will chose the option with any risk.<br />
<br />
Sure the reward is better for time spent, but when you aren't confident in your tank's ability to survive the mobs or the clerics mana pool or if the rogue is running round with his epic and a defenders lightblade and doing less DPS than the tank, then most players are going to take the sure thing 51points closer to the goal than risk a loss of time / ranking / points.<br />
<br />
Personally I'm pretty reluctant to do hards on my main with pickup groups, I'm not really prepared to waste time or add more losses to my ranking.  I'd rather do a hard than a normal, but I want to do it with people I know.  Alternatively on my chanter alt I enjoy doing hards and I'm quite happy to risk a loss as I do them more for the fun / challenge than for points.  Did one with a 7.5k buffed tank using his anger3 augged epic 2hs a couple of weeks back where we won in the last 5mins or so but he tanked the mobs easy enough - cleric was my g/f's twink in mostly ornate gear / FT8 so not super geared.<br />
<br />
So sure you probably could tank a hard LDoN and you don't need a superbly geared healer or support team do it, though you do need a group who are competent and willing to risk a loss.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">07-13-2004, 08:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As expressed above, yes you can do them, but you need to have group members who are better geared than you to succeed with ease.  With tank hitpoints on the low end of the spectrum, two things will drain cleric mana quickly<br />
<br />
A. Low DPS.  If the cleric has to blow 3-4 cheals on you per mob because your group can't whack it down fast enough, its going to be a pain.<br />
<br />
B. Poor slowers.  If the mob is being slowed when it is at 50% health, your cleric mana is going to be stressed.  Personally, I prefer shamans, bst, and then enchanter for slowers in that order.  Enchanter takes longer to slow, and often are quicker to go down if they get agro and/or resists (this of course varies with the skill and gear of the chanter).<br />
<br />
You can help your group survival rate immensely by using your defensive and furious discs to save your ass during a late cheal/ double pull.  Also, snare is extremely effective in Hard ldon.   Snare allows you to min-kite the mob if the cheal is late or you get a nasty damage spike.  (just keep stepping back out of melee range, don't run around like some noob caster)  Snare will also reduce the number of times you blow taunt because the mob has ran out of distance after the slower or the idiot with no agro control in the group.<br />
<br />
One last piece of advice, try to group with a secondary healer when first starting ldon.  It will help out survival immensely.  Also get topped off by your healer in between pulls.  You run the risk of dying or getting cleric agro when you start fights at 75% with &lt;8k buffed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">07-13-2004, 09:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sassinak--thanks...I was looking at getting some WA before going sturdieness.  While the HP are nice I was wondering if it was time to bump the agro abit. I could probably get WA1 fairly fast into a adv now. <br />
<br />
Kheldar-- I am not too worried about doing them easily. Just doing them with a reasonable chance to win. <br />
<br />
Most of the groups I put to gether (and I have a bunch of fairly regular friend we do this with) are over 100 wins and probably the same in AAs. Think we are all begining to bump into the &quot;no raid no gear&quot; cieling--hards mihgt help that some. Myself I am grinding the 10 AC augs in LDoN so will be a couple of weeks before I drop it down to the bottom of my list for XP zones. (2 of 5 now--I can't really see anything beating 80 AC for 2550 points)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vilicontus</div><div class="date">07-13-2004, 09:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Even with my current gear and AAs, hard ldons are a challenge, and rightfully so. Given full buffs, you should be capable of tanking in hards, but I suspect the first 1-2 might be very challenging. Try the ldons in a consistent group, and you will see that your coordination gets better over time. Some thoughts after going through some hard ldons:<br />
<br />
1. Necros are a good addition. With the ability to mindwrack casters and do other fun stuff to undead, they are good to have around.<br />
<br />
2. Auto attack OFF. Can't stress this enough, with a dual wield combo ripostes can be a pain, and I actually learnt when to time turning auto attack off in hard ldons. With anger 3 procs, you should be ok for aggro to stop attacking for a while.<br />
<br />
3. Endurance issues. Oddly enough, given the rate mobs are pulled in my hard ldons, I actually have enough endurance to use all my discs over time. In easy ldons, my endurance bar gets eaten up fast from just using Incite. So if your endurance is decent, don't be afraid to blow that Defensive or Fortitude and even Mightystrike/Fellstrike discs to help your survival.<br />
<br />
Hope you enjoy Hard ldons. They can be a pain, but they can be a lot of fun once you get the hang of things  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frostpaw</div><div class="date">07-14-2004, 12:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This has been mentioned by previous posters, but I want to re-emphasize it: <br />
<br />
Puller is key. A good puller bringing the group back a steady supply of singles will make up for many many deficiencies (both real and perceived) in gear. Im trying to add more hard LDoN's to my diet, and a good puller seems to be more important than whether you are 7500hp buffed or 9k buffed or whatever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">07-14-2004, 12:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ..... soooo true<br />
<br />
With a good bard you can have a constant feed of slowed singles being pulled to camp and waiting for you mezzed just as you finish off the mob you are fighting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lokkak</div><div class="date">07-14-2004, 01:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I tried ldon with 6k hp, 1400 ac with only LR1/ID1.<br />
<br />
I got killed over and over and over and over and over and over.  We would do good to kill 10 mobs before timer expired.  I spent HOURS doing them.  It was simply not anything less than near impossible.<br />
<br />
At the time I could tank in Solro ( a protector or ro) without trouble.  I had pulled as many as 5 (a protectors of ro) at once without deaths.  I always played with the same group and the group contained VERY good enc, wiz, clr x 2.<br />
<br />
I simply couldn't do ldon.  If I got two, I always died.<br />
<br />
Now, that I have LR5/ID5 ldon hard seems like kunark.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gazu</div><div class="date">07-14-2004, 01:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">YOU need a good puller - period - end of story. I did a North Ro hard LDoN. We had to kill 59 monsters I think it was. We zoned into a room with 6 Mobs in it. Without a good puller - we would have just walked into a EXP nightmare (With deaths, Rezz's, and mana recovery. ). Our puller in this case was a Level 55 pally. I being a level 55 Troll Warrior with 1191AC and 5132HPs buffed with Virtue - we didn't do to bad at all. The Cleric had KEI and a Horse - Had a Beast, SK, and an Enchanter to back fill with slows, haste, and DPS. We didnt win - but we didn't die -  we had 53 monsters dead before we lost. In some cases the SK FD pulled hallways where the Pally couldn't target to Pacify (Not a Pally so I have no clue what their spells are ..  ;) .. I think its Pacify.) At any rate we did a good job .. got great EXP .. BS'd like we knew each other for years .. and to tell ya the truth .. I really didn't care that I lost. If I was a little more serious we may have won .. but I think our moods would have been a whole lot worse if we had a crappy Puller. PULLING is the key ... crowd control is next ... followed by DPS ... IMHO. <br />
<br />
I think the delay really came from the FD pulls - perhaps you may want to think about this - we lost more time tring to mitigate the MOB control from FD'ing then to simply pacify - shoot an arrow - and go to town. I have nothing against monks or SK's - but for a timed event this may not be the best method to single pull. Again only my opinion.<br />
<br />
I know we had a chanter - so why not just pull 3 mobs and go for it? WELL - I have seen this attempt in a Normal LDoN with only 2 mobs in the room - and the chanter went down faster than ALE on a hot day. The argo on these LDoN mobs are quite high - If the chanter even debuffs to land a Mez .... boom argo and death - Rez time. I enjoy the aspect of a character designed to pull mobs do just that - and the Chanter being more of a charmer / debuffer / haster. When we did this LDoN there were 4 times when we couldn't help but to get 2 mobs - she would charm one and use it to beat down the other - when the charm broke ususally close to the end of the first fight - the SK would snare and argo right away - when I was done I would start beating on the Mob / Bellow / taunt / and eventually pull the mob off of the SK. He then would suck them dry and heal himself. All in all if the chanter tried mezzing - possibly having it resist - she would have been a punching bag. <br />
<br />
The Moral to this story - ITS A HARD LDoN -- LOL. Find friends and characters that have grown into their character classes, and understand what they are doing. <br />
<br />
There should never be any pride issues as far as what the group feels your role is compared to past events ... with that being said no matter what your skills are at the GROUP should backfill any kinds of weaknesses. If all they have to do is yell at you on why your AC is too low -- or why is your HP's not high enough -- then tell them to start a warrior and work him up with EQUIP and Weapons -- then maybe their finger wiggling butts would stop being so hard on one of the best damn classes in the game.  :D A warrior is a rough class - our Skill is matched by our Equipment as well. If the group has a shammy and a cleric .. then why is the Shammy only slowing - should be throwing additional heals in there with the cleric to reduce mana burn ... stuff like that.<br />
<br />
Anyway huge post - lots to say -- Thanks for letting me vent.<br />

We did it in similiar gear,although back then using a monk was hard hehe.You'll probably find it easier with a bard pulling/cc,shammy or beast slowing and an extra healer if no shammy.Snare of course is godly.<br />

<br />
Ruj, Mistmoore, and Miragul are usually not as bad.  Guk varies a lot depending on the map you get.  However with Ruj you can get Arena of Chance which is an absolute nightmare to pull even on Hard with mobs being more spread out than usual.  Every theme has its share of 'bad' levels to pull but Arena of Chance is the one that definitely stands out.</div></div><hr />

Very easy to pull, for the most part the worst u will get is 2 mobs even if you dont have a fd / bard puller. <br />

As stated previously pulling is key, if you can keep mobs to singles and the occasional adds even poorly equipped people can do fine.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kitre Halfax</div><div class="date">07-14-2004, 09:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a regular weekly group that does LDoN for 4 hours. Assume that all the &quot;regular&quot; group attributes apply (we're good at working together, we know how each other thinks, etc).<br />
<br />
Since &quot;ubers&quot; comprise a good part of the group, we're an exception, but this info may help other tanks out there looking to do LDoN.<br />
<br />
The cleric has FT15, over 300AA, and is in a post-Time guild<br />
The enchanter has FT15, over 400AA, and has retired from a post-Time guild<br />
The necro is in Magister (top guild on EMarr), and has more hit points than I do . He pulls for us.<br />
We also have a beastlord that's about the same on AA as me (~100) and a druid that's a little behind (~70).<br />
<br />
We did normals until I had worked up LR5 and ID3, then we tried our first Hard. This is how we handled the Hards until I finished &quot;growing up&quot;.<br />
<br />
- treat every pull as a named (but without using discs). Set up good aggro before asking them to assist, make sure the adds are taken care of, keep your finger hovering over that AET hotkey (you DO have AET, right?), use 2h weapons to reduce ripostes (if that's in your weaponry)...etc<br />
<br />
- make the puller work singles out. Our enchanter is a badass - he's hands down  the best enchanter I've seen in 4+ years of EQ. However, we used that as our &quot;ace in the hole&quot; for when the stuff really hit the fan.<br />
<br />
- adjust your buffs to concentrate on hp/ac and hp regeneration. Yeah, I said regen. I added Regen, Druid HoT (lasts about 3 min), Cleric HoT to my buff lineup when planning slots. Since Cleric and Druid HoT's stack, on top of regen and BST Crack, you can get some serious hp's coming back to you, enough that your regen during a fight actually matters.<br />
<br />
- bring a tracker. The only REAL, practical advantage to doing Hards is the loot from the named. Sure, you can get &quot;more xp&quot; but since even Hard xp is crap (/rude nerfed zones and the developers who make them), that's not a draw. And the rush of doing hards wears off after 5 adventures of no named at all. /cry<br />
<br />
- stick to challenges you KNOW you can win. We will spend 30 minutes getting a Collect 23-27, rather than add to our risk by doing a rescue (got screwed too many times), a slaughter (it's rough killing THAT MANY mobs in a Hard adventure, unless your group has major DPS), or an assassinate (O.o we *might* could handle the boss at the end, but why worry about it?).<br />
<br />
Your stats on your Magelo are very similar to where mine were at the time I started. You've got the equipment to survive, if you can find the team to back you up. I do recommend 2 priests, for backup heals - and even then you'll have some rough spots.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />

I'd say being a weaker tank it's all about quick easy slows. being a beefier tank, you giggle at the melee dps of these mobs. It's pretty weak , even unslowed =P they MIGHT be 100 more dps..

I'm lvl 63 with not a single AA &lt;waiting till 65&gt; and have been gone almost a year so I'm sporting a lovely collection of Brellium/Thurgadin armor. With buffs I was a little over 1200ac and about 6.1khp. The group consisted of me, 65 bard, 65 chanter, 65 chanter, 65 shaman and 65 cleric. About half the mobs were blue cons and the rest were even/yellow to me. Bard pulled, I died twice the entire mission and we failed the mission with one piece to go to complete it and that was because of a lack of DPS, but we were really just doing it for fun anyways and not looking for the perfect group. Neither chanter grabbed a pet either although I'm not sure if that's possible with ldon yet since I've only been back about 2 weeks =)</div></div><hr />

Was Basically in Helanic Tundra, Valorium RIngs, and Used GSoT to cut down on Ripostes. Was a gorup of us that had been doing normals for about 3 weeks together, finishing in between 30 and 45 minutes. I buffed to 7200 HP and 1350 AC. We did Rujark and took about 45 minutes to get past the first intersection we ran into. Wrote that one off as far as winning but stuck it out and got experience of what to expect for the whole group. Tried again a few days later and won a collect 20 with about 5 minutes to spare. No one had more than 100 AA. Second time Bard did much better, only died 2x and I only died once. Warrior, Cleric, Rogue, Bard, Beastlord, Ranger was group, only Rogue with Elemental loot.<br />
<br />
You'll be able to do fine as long as you have some decent DPS. As said above, Clerics CAN keep you healed, but if fight is lasting much longer than incite, they'll start to get low on mana kinda quick.<br />

Good luck :)</div></div><hr />

Pulling isn't a big issue if you stick to the easy themes to pull (Miragul is probably easiest, then Mistmoore and Rujarkian).  <br />
<br />
People really should respect the mobs on Hard more though... that's how you fail Hard.  I actually prefer to do Hard with people with less gear compare to the best geared people (e.g. my guild) because people with uber gear get arrogant and think they're invinicible and then die.  One of the intriacies of Hard LDoN as well as higher GoD zones is the presence of hasters can make that same group of 3 mobs almost twice as deadly if they're near an Enchanter and most people don't realize that until it's too late.</div></div><hr />

Hard LDoN mobs frankly are not hard at all once they are debuffed but in their natural state (generally close quarters with a ton of Druid/Enchanter/Shaman mobs) they are very, very frequently buffed.  Getting those buffs stripped asap is important indeed.<br />
<br />
For ease of operations in undergeared LDoNs I prefer to have someone pre-pull and mezz/debuff mobs while others kill the ones in camp.  It might seem a little hard on enchanter mana but frankly, screw em.  They'll save mana in the long-term anyhow.  Creative use of root, pacification (although I hate it really) and snare can make pulling even places like takish and guk pretty easy really.  I do recommend a rogue scout/puller or a monk/bard in there, although a decent enchanter works very well also.<br />
<br />
I'd also note that any GoD spells for the shaman, enchanter, bard or cleric go a long, long ways to making these trivial again.</div></div><hr />

go for the the GSoT its damn good aggro, forget about the GPoS for aggro because it's just an DPS weapon. if you have both, aug the GPoS with a DD proc or a Domage augment for when you are not tanking, and use the GSoT auged A3 for when you have to tank<br />

<br />
A)    Have the bard/chanter mezz the mob while it is incoming, debuff and slow it, and after slow sticks, taunt the mob until you succeed, then break mezz.  This is very slow, but it is very safe, as the only risk is a resisted mezz.<br />
<br />
B)    Same as A., but have members root and snare the mob during incoming, then have the mob slowed, then engage.  This is safer for an enchanter than A. but might involve mini-kiting by the slower.  This takes a bit of cooperation from all members of the group, but it is safe, if not ugly.<br />
<br />
After you get a successful taunt on slow, you shouldn't be losing agro that much, if at all.<br />

If you want to aug a 2hander, the GSoT is the one to do. It would be darn fine with a yak or a3 on it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sandro - if the GSoT isn't holding agro, you might need to talk to your group members and get them to change tactics.  I sometimes use this weapon (no augs) and I don't have agro problems in hard ldon or GoD.  It's not as good on agro as my regular 1 handers with anger augs, but it's not bad either.<br />
<br />
As to damage while using 2 handers versus 1 handers...<br />
I know this is a highly debated topic, but I definitely feel riposte induced spikes can be a major problem in hard ldon's and GoD - at least it is for me.  (1550 ac, 8500 hp, all defensive aa's) I don't know how to parse spikes, but I do know the clerics have a lot easier time keeping me alive in hard ldons and GoD when I use a 2hander.<br />
<br />
Note:  once the mob is slowed, spike damage isn't an issue since the mob dps isn't that bad...it's only a problem for me before the mob is slowed - if they get a couple ripostes off it can be bad.  Also, I rarely get killed by the mobs, but they can force the cleric to use less mana-efficient heals - so the net result is the group has to slow down to wait for the cleric to med.</div></div><hr />

Well I &quot;only&quot; got the shammy killed several times, thing is GSoT was ok once it procced a couple times - but if it dident proc and shammy got resisted on slow he got owned... But prolly gonna follow your advice and ykesha aug it to have 2stuns for caster interrupt.<br />

As I have a necro with maxxed research I might look into this as this seems as a nice 2hander for tanking with the stun proc and ac/hp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cuthbadth</div><div class="date">07-22-2004, 01:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1 hander vs. 2 hander ... not sure that argument will ever be resolved completely.  :)<br />
<br />
I used the droga combo and rarely had problems.  However, if you're almost dead, do your cleric a favor and turn off auto attack, I don't care if you're dual wielding or wielding a 2 hander, any riposte damage at low health (less than 1 full bub of health) is your fault.<br />
<br />
Quite frankly, for the hard ldon I did in BB theme, I would rather eat a little more riposte damage and let my DPS crew kill faster...not to mention, these same mobs would kill the druid or cleric in less than 10 seconds (or at least that's about how long it seemed to take for them to die on the two pulls I couldn't get agro on all the mobs).<br />
<br />
Additionally, if you're eating your clerics mana and cleric is regular group member, take em to BoT and farm the ft2 ornate bracers and then to droga to farm the ft2 shoulder quest pieces.  In the meantime request that they work on scm3 and at least mc1 and then their aa mana free heal and then the aa called divine arbitration.<br />
<br />
Fair warning, only done one Hard LDoN (but it was a win and have done several GoD plant runs for xp), so there are definitely more experienced warriors whose advice is probably better.  ;)  From what I saw, if a bard pulls, make sure they have the FM AA as it can definitely save a wipe on a really bad pull (I saw one pull that would've been 5+ mobs not kill anyone due to bard using FM).</div></div><hr />

I buff to low to mid 1600s AC and 9100-9400 hit points and dmg spikes in ldon hards can be pretty brutal even though I have all defensive AA (and about 300 AA total).  At 2k AC their dps output is probably a joke, but not at a little over 1600.  I quite frequently see hits for 700+.  <br />
<br />
to the original poster... <br />
You're having trouble getting Hard groups because people want it to be easy.  If they take a heavily elemental or Time geared tank, it's easy.  If they take you, they have to know WTF they're doing and really work at it.  It's hard to watch TV and keep you alive, damn it!  :p  My healer(s) and I have to be on our toes in a Hard and I have your hit points and other stats beat by a fair margin.  Just a couple days ago I kept having to back away from mobs and mini-kite them til the heal landed and I still died twice on an adventure.  The heals were consistently a little late so the spikes were getting me.  <br />
<br />
I stick with my 1 handers but it may be hurting me.  I may check my aggro holding ability next time with a GSot4W.  I've seen some bad dmg spikes where a mob got 3 hard riposte hits on me in just a couple of seconds plus their regular attacks.  Ouch.  I guess I can thank max haste, 18 and 20 delay 1 handers, and my ferocity, ambidexterity, and flurry 6 AAs for that.  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">07-22-2004, 05:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">by the way, is it just me or does it seem like paladins tank a lot of hards better?  They seem to have multiple stuns that work pretty well and that mitigates a ton of dps.  My recent hards have had a paladin in the group and she stuns for me quite a bit while I'm tanking, not enough to gimp aggro much, but just when the wrong person gets hit or heals look to be late or the snare wasn't thrown in time.  It works great, landing quite frequently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cuthbadth</div><div class="date">07-22-2004, 06:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmm, I didn't notice getting hit for max damage that often (close to 1k) at all and quite often in the 300 - 500 range, although a sprinkle of 700's here and there.  I don't know what songs the bard was playing, it is possible he was crippling as well.<br />
<br />
Yes, I was only around 7800 HP and 1560 AC and only had CA3/CS3/PE/LR1.<br />
<br />
I did have a druid for backup heals, I do not know how much he had to help the cleric.<br />
<br />
I usually did not have enough room to kite any mob for heal to land so I just turned off auto attack and kept my front to the mob.<br />
<br />
I also did the BB theme as it has been my experience (or imagination) that the mobs in EC theme seem hasted and hit a little harder than compared to normal EF, NR or BB themes.<br />
<br />
It's entirely possible I just lucked out and the mobs were weaker than normal, there is one Plant run where I swear the golems seemed easier than normal LDoN mobs.  I haven't seen them that weak since.  I don't know if anyone else has seen anything like that.<br />
<br />
Also, yes, my group was NOT a pickup group.  To be honest, I wouldn't try a hard ldon with a pickup group without doing a normal ldon first.  I've seen too many 65's that just don't play up to their classes potential...so much that I won't invite them back to a normal ldon if I can find a 64 of a desirable class that I've never grouped with before.<br />
<br />
Also, as I mentioned (in this thread or a different thread), I did not hesitate to use defensive, AET, furious, etc. whenever it seemed necessary.  I did not 'save' these for possible named, I 'saved' them for bad pulls (anything with 2 - 3 mobs, anything more druid wisely evac'd us).<br />
<br />
Finally, if I didn't say it before, the cleric in my group is my wife, it makes communication a lot easier and our group has played together for close to 2 years (excepting the bard, bard is closer to 6 months off and on).<br />
<br />
Cleric: 65 w/ 90+ AA (note: would occaisionally use high level 75 mana stun).<br />
Druid: 65 w/ 80+ AA.<br />
Ranger: 65 w/ 140+ AA.<br />
Bard: 65 w/ 130+ AA.<br />
Mage: 65 w/ 130+ AA (note: was using air pet)<br />
Warrior: 65 w/ 70? AA (click magelo).</div></div><hr />

Get the LAA for seeing the spell name in cast message.  Then go into an LDON and stand around watching mob cast messages.  You'll be quiet shocked to see these guys focused and hasted and sowed and virtued and dmg shieled...etc.  <br />
<br />
If it aint the enchanter mobs its the shaman, if it aint the shaman its the cleric mobs.  I'm still awaiting to see a wizard mob evac her group :)  hahah, but seriously, if you see a cast from a mob, have some one annul on pull, its not allot of agro and can seriously help the kill.<br />

Just did my second hard ldon with mostly the same group, except a beastlord with 100+ AA replaced the Druid and a 100+ AA rogue replaced the ranger.  We still won and the mobs seemed to hit a lot slower with a designated slower.  :)  However, we did have a partial wipe once due to a bad pull and I can definitely see where not having an evacer could cause a bad pull to make a win into a loss for time constraints.  That being said, we did the BB theme again and lucked out in not getting the castle theme (brick walls, etc.), it was the rough hewn cave adventure.  This seemed noticably easier on the bard for pulling, unfortunately once again, there were no named, nor augments to be found.<br />
<br />
I'm just curious, how rare are the augments and named in hards?  Is it similar to normals, or are they noticably less common?</div></div><hr />

I like to try to get a couple of rangers in there.  If an AA comes, the can snare it and root it off to the side or out of the way.  The only times I have trouble in hards is when one person in the group doesn't know what they're doing.  Like in a BB Hard, the chanter had never been asked to paci assist on the pulls.  We ended up wiping 4 times and losing the adventure by one item.  This chanter also mezed the mobs I was fighting, then wondered why mez broke.  If you don't have people who can play on their A game, do waste your time with a hard.  Just blitz through an easy in like 20 minutes.</div></div><hr />
