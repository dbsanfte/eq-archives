<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kenneys Bounces</div><div class="date">11-11-2003, 12:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's a few of mine inspired by the previous post :<br />
<br />
1) Retroactive change to all/all pieces from high level bosses. (reduction in HP).<br />
Create a turn in npc to handle the armor pieces. Warriors can turn in the existing armor for their class ONLY for pieces with more hps and No mana crap.<br />
<br />
Verant MUST decide what the HP/AC gap between warriors and hybrids should be. Then Implement armor that goes with this. No more all/all crap except for jewelry. <br />
Furthermore, i believe they should simply announce their plans on the HP/AC gap between warriors and hybrids and let the community argue over it.<br />
<br />
2) Aggro lock - Verant MUST decide once again whether ANY sort of tanking class should ever be given aggro lock. I want them to announce this, with their reasons behind it.<br />
If they wish to give aggro lock, then make it so that all plate classes have the best aggro lock in the game equally. Let the light tanks have horrid aggro lock. (IE: rangers, beastlords, monks, rogues). This will require a lot of changes to aggro spells.<br />
<br />
If they do not wish to give aggro lock, then make it so that all plate classes have the WORST aggro lock in the game equally. Let the light tanks have moderate aggro lock, and casters have the most aggro lock. <br />
<br />
If they wish to have the warrior have the worst aggro lock in the game, with two other plate class hybrids having the best, then make it so that the warrior MUST be used in fighting higher-ended boss mobs in every situation. Easy and lazy and wrong fix would be to create a defensive disc for lvl 65's that lasts for 20 minutes where the boss kills anyone without it in single round.<br />
This way, hybrids will trample warriors over in xp groups, trample warriors in raid MT'ing normals, but lose to warriors in MT'ing boss mobs. (where this is the current situation until hybrids get quarm loot and take over the last job a warrior has)<br />
<br />
3) DPS - Why on earth is a high end SK/warrior doing just as much(if not more) DPS than a high end monk? This absolutely does not make sense. Balance dps, balance the weapons, balance the damage tables accordingly.<br />
<br />
4) Dual wield - Dual wield is NOT an option in tanking high ended mobs. This is silly and absurd due to the way riposte works. This handicap on a warrior is absolutely stupid and unjustified for.<br />
Change riposte to where 5 ripostes is guaranteed in a minute regardless of weapon speed. (sort of like how procs work on weapons)<br />
<br />
5) Improve taunt - Make it so that not only does taunt have a higher level of success, but also taunt puts you on the top of the list with (level X 2) points of hate.<br />
<br />
-Make it so that taunt works 99% of the time on blue mobs. (if all classes should have aggro lock that is)<br />
<br />
-Make taunt a ranged skill. <br />
<br />
That should fix things up.</div></div><hr />
