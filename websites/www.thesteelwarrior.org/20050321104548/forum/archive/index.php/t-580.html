If so, what kind of stats/preparation did you take to do so?  Am just considering trying it and would like to get some input first.<br />

<br />
I used damage shield and stinging wort potions, a truncheon of doom to slow, and a scimitar of lifestealing for the fight.</div></div><hr />

He spawns in the nook area up the ramp from the Angry Goblin. Soloing him shouldn’t be a problem with a ToD like Raaj stated, but if you have 3-4 adds on you as well it might make for an interesting fight. It's better to be safe than sorry especially on that mob.</div></div><hr />

Having already taken the HT, it wasn't so bad the second time.  When I was at about 60% health the ToD finally proc'd and I switched to a Windblade and whacked him until he fell, leaving me with 8% health and 2 adds on me.  Whacked the adds and healed up a bit in his room and then made my way back to Chardok and got my ring =).<br />
<br />
A note to all people who still need to do the Skargus fight... There are rumors that Droga/Nurga are being revamped as lvl60+ zones on test server, so I'd recommend you get down there and whack him while he's still fairly easy to get to.<br />
