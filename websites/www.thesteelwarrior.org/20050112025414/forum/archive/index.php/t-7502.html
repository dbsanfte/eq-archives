<br />
Quick idea and seeking some advice.  I'm sitting at 62 right now, grinding to 65 with LDoNs, BoT groups and even some PoV groups.  I'm tired of losing aggro when a chanty/shaman slows mah mob.  It gets annoying and any time I lose aggro to a debuff I feel i'm just not doing my job.  I'm currently working on Mir LDoNs, my long term plan was to A3 my BoC and Yak my Render, but i'm getting impatient.  I'm really tempted to hit 510 points and snag a A2, toss it on the BoC, then snag another 510 points and put another A2 on my Render.  For 1120 points, I can add 2 400 hate procs.  I'm not a raiding warrior, aside from some pickup stuff now and then, but I want a &quot;Quick Fix&quot;.<br />
<br />
Thoughts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">06-09-2004, 04:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A CHoS or SotB in the off hand might be better aggro. I'd suggest saving up for anger 3 over anger 2, personally, because the odds are very low that you'll replace that BoC any time soon. If you REALLY like doing LDoNs, upgrading from anger 2 to anger 3 is an option. How are you inciting? To pull? As the mob is inc? If you're doing everything right, then they just need to slow down the debuffs. Not much else you can do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">IgneousKB</div><div class="date">06-09-2004, 05:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you want a dirt cheap solution, buy the lowest cost ykesha aug. Same stun as the higher cost ones, same agro. Roughly same agro as Anger2, albeit not unresistable. In most normal situations, this should not matter a great deal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shirion</div><div class="date">06-09-2004, 06:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, if you do want to go cheap. Get the cheapest Yak aug, it is equivalent to anger 2, with  stun and some dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neksnappa</div><div class="date">06-09-2004, 08:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We all lose aggro to a slow or occasional snare/debuff/dot as a mob is pulled. The only way I ever keep aggro through a slow is if I get a proc prior to the slow, and then use incite, which depending on the proc, gives me a total of around 750-850 aggro. With WA4 and 3 aggro procs, this scenario isn't uncommon.<br />
<br />
If you start meleeing a mob, and don't get a proc, I would not blow incite, nor should you ever use incite as a mob is running towards you. First, I'm still doubtful of whether soe has fixed the aggro bug if a mob is far away or you haven't done damage yet. Also, if you use incite, and then the mob is slowed, you'll still lose aggro, and a succesful taunt or a proc is needed to get it back. If you taunt, it is basically like you never used incite, because you'll be at 701 aggro, where the slower is at 700 or so. Rather, this is what I do on pulls in groups:<br />
<br />
Mob is pulled and running towards the group.<br />
Shoot an arrow or two and have the puller run directly past you. 9 times out of 10, the mob will forget the puller and start whacking you.<br />
Start meleeing, and hope for a quick proc.<br />
Shaman/ench/bst casts slow. If you have not gotten a proc, let the slower get aggro. Use taunt to get aggro, and THEN use incite, so you are 400+ points above slower on aggro list. If you got a proc off prior to slow, use incite asap after the proc, and you will maintain aggro.<br />
<br />
Also, if you have a good low-lag connection, and/or the slower has a message saying slow is being cast, you should be able to taunt quickly after slow lands, before the mob is out of your range. If it works, you'll keep aggro, use incite, and get complimented for your uber aggro control =) This works especially well on larger mobs like in BoT, where you can taunt from a good ways away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wolveren</div><div class="date">06-09-2004, 09:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wouldn't worry too much about the difference between Anger 2 and 3 if you're not a hardcore raider. Keeping agro in groups is usually more a matter of quantity than quality of procs. Incite + an anger 2 proc at the start should be good enough to keep agro most of the time, unless you have someone in the group who is either stupid or trying to piss you off.<br />
Like someone else said, replace the Render with a CHOS or something similar, put anger 2 on both, get some Weapon Affinity and you'll be gtg.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">06-09-2004, 09:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anger 2 vs Ykesha procs: Ykesha procs win. Same aggro, more DPS, same points. If you can get Guk groups, go Ykesha, all the way. I'm still all about long term efficiency over short term solutions, though. What's happening to you is just the way things are... On incoming, warriors don't have the aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thorix</div><div class="date">06-09-2004, 11:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh, now I feel like an idiot.  Okay, am I doing this wrong... for example, Lower Sands group, I usually end up pulling, it's fairly easy to get singles.  I use the incite line to pull, drag the mob back, start melee'ing, then pretty much smash the incite line whenever it pops, unless I see a few BoC procs fire away.  In LDoN, I use the incite line to tag off the puller.   Should I not being using it like this?  And I only use taunt if I lose aggro, I tend to have fairly good luck with successful taunts, I know some people smash taunt every time it pops, but I enjoy the safety of a snap back aggro option, even though it doesn't always work.<br />
<br />
On a second note, imo, adding a aggro proc to the Render &gt; equiping my CHoS.  The statisic difference is HUGE (and it's so nice to not look like every other pre-65 warrior on the Trib using a SotB and CHos).  I love the proc rate on the Render and the 75 hp lifetap proc'ing like crazy, albiet not a ton of aggro (if any), does add up in terms of hps.  But I may be wrong here, maybe using the Render is costing me more than it is worth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">06-09-2004, 12:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just try to hit the mob with an arrow or a melee round before inciting. You're using taunt correctly. I'm not positive that a CHoS would be better offhand, though I suspect the aggro would be some better. Basically, it's just not having snap aggro, which is the basic warrior problem.</div></div><hr />

Don't fall into the trap of &quot;I don't want to look the same as the others&quot;.  They are using those for a reason.  To get aggro. And it works.  I had slight problems with aggro before I got my anger 3s.  Now that I have them, I will never live without them.  Get anger 3s and WA to 3 or higher and you can go read a newspaper until the mob is dead. :)<br />
<br />
Good luck and I would wait for anger 3.  Just my opinion, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crathsor Gnawbones</div><div class="date">06-09-2004, 01:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hopefully the shaman's you are grouping with is leading first with Malo then Slow.  If they slow off the bat its going to generate fast agro on them</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">06-09-2004, 01:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">if youre not a regular hardcore raider, or you arent going to play MT, i would go duel yak augs on the weapons you have now.  that right there, with WA5 will be more aggro than you ever need.  I have to agree quantity &gt; quality unless youre plan on fighting the same mob for over 3-4 mins with some heavy aggro produced late in the fight (boss mobs).<br />
<br />
<br />
ps- i would use a render in offhand over a droga for a couple of reasons reasons ... first of all the looks are sweet ... secondly it will generate more dps ... thirdly the stats on it own droga ... fourthly offhand procs are so random that if youre counting on them to hold aggro ... chances are you wont be holding aggro very much.<br />
<br />
<br />
keep the render and yak aug it ... you will get a ton of mileage out of your current setup with a few ldon points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">06-09-2004, 01:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">this is what i always do .. i tag with arrows then incite on incoming when i am pulling .... tag off puller with arrows then incite on incoming after i have initial aggro.<br />
<br />
if i break mez i land a taunt then incite ... if someone had aggro on raids and i'm cycling through otanks to tank them .. i only incite after a good taunt.<br />
<br />
<br />
the only time you should ever incite when incite's dot is still active is perhaps on a raid mob for above and beyond aggro ... mashing it every time it pops is on par with mashing taunt.  its useless to do if you already have aggro.<br />
<br />
<br />
yak aug or anger3 (plz dont waste points on anger2) your BoC .. then yak/anger3 your render.  buy some WA after you hit 65 and enjoy.  you may have initial aggro problems still (hell we all do now and then) ... but your aggro will be invincible otherwise, unless youre grouping with people who arent moderating themselves.</div></div><hr />

  While I agree that more procs &gt; fewer procs in general, 2 anger 3 augments will proc as much as 2 ykesha augments, for substantially more aggro per proc. Because the original poster is probably never going to upgrade those weapons, all he'd have to buy for the foreseeable future is 2 anger 3 augments. If he bought anger 2 augments, he'd want to upgrade them eventually. It's my personal advice to grind out less LDoN missions in general, so just to save for anger 3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rodney</div><div class="date">06-09-2004, 01:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Two things I would like to add,  first I do agree Incite seems to work better for me if it works off of damage or a good taunt.   I wait to incite till after I have turned on atk and hit the taunt button.  <br />
<br />
   Anger3  works much better then anger 2 or Yak procs, for me an Anger 3 proc will over ride SLOW just about every time and yak or anger 2 is about 50% of the time.<br />
<br />
  Oh and one more, I break mez with  <br />
1 taunt then incite<br />
2 if taunt landed turn on atk<br />
3 if taunt failed wait for recycle and taunt again<br />
4 turn on atk<br />
<br />
   I never wait more then one taunt cycle if in a LDoN</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">06-09-2004, 01:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anger II is crap.  Don't buy it.  1 anger 3 proc mainhand will get you more aggro than 2 anger II's.  If you really have to have a proc right away buy the 510 point Ykesha, but if it was me I would just wait for A3.  With a BoC you are already doing better than a lot of people your level aggro-wise, and buying Anger 2 will just waste your points and make it even longer before you have your anger 3 proc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Omnus</div><div class="date">06-09-2004, 02:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First thing would be yak aug the render, and then stick it out for either the better yak aug for the boc or anger3. <br />
<br />
Suggesttions for agro, would be try to make sure you get your dex maxed from buffs, ask for NDT from chanters and get weapon affinty atleast 1-3 levels.<br />
<br />
But agro is always going to be tough. Tash is so fast casting, and then slow is still hard to keep the mobs off a chanter. i find shaman much easier to hold agro off of, because due to the fact malos is very low agro compared to tash. It sucks to have it happen, but it will always happen. I use BF+anger3, Boc+anger3, and wa5, every offensive aa but ripostes and ss, but my good friend is a wizzy who usually takes agro once a fight simply because he has so much mana regen and he even has agro decresing aa. even at 12-14 procs per minute, there can always be 6-8 seconds if not more before i proc once, and tash + slow easily fits into that. <br />
<br />
I know a quick fix would be great, but as you improve your char so do those aroudn you. The only way to get ahead is not waste your time. And anger2 augs are really a waste of time. If your primary concern is getting more agro, look at ykesha augs, anger3, weapon affinity, and for consistancy, ferocity is probably the most efficient aa for gettting dps agro (by dps agro i just mean that agro that comes from weapon damage)</div></div><hr />

Horsehocky. Part of the beauty of Anger Augs and Incite is that you don't have to cookie-cutter. If you have Ykesha procs on proccing weapons, in all but high end raid situations, that's more than enough aggro at the level you're at, and a hell of a lot cheaper. You can get Anger 3's after you upgrade to true EB/TB weapons.<br />
<br />
EDIT - forgot you had a BoC. Anger 3 that thing.<br />
<br />
For the original poster, I'd pull with arrows. If your slower is the type who's used to Knight aggro, you'd be better served saving the Incite for after a successful taunt, considering that the range aggro of Incite is borked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azaza</div><div class="date">06-10-2004, 12:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ykesha is good.<br />
<br />
Getting WA1 or 2 will surely help a fair bit too. I wouldn't worry about spending AA's on them this early either.... earlier the better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">06-10-2004, 12:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">WA is great.If you're having trouble with slow/debuff aggro pull right to the caster and stand on him.Incite and my opening attack round is about 90+ pct likely to over come my wife's shammy slow.If a chanter wants to tash/slow on incoming I pull to him and taunt-incite after slow.Shield helps a lil when you're unlucky.<br />
<br />
If you really want xp group aggro now;I'd bag the render,aug the chos with a2 and main hand it with BOC off hand.I'd wait to a3 the BOC and then switch them.Screw weapon stats.They're a great addition when they don't detract from your potential aggro,but, you got lots of slots for hp/ac gear.<br />
<br />
I play with people who tank fine with a3 auged dps weapons,but,their agro is noticably less than mine.It's a trade off hehe...I'd go for the aggro just imho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">06-10-2004, 12:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Probably better just sucking it up and a3'n the BOC tho.I'd off hand the chos.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tarvok</div><div class="date">06-10-2004, 04:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with the BoC/CHoS combo for agro. Also, the /shield &lt;slower&gt; helps with getting agro back quick, you just have to be close to them. One last thing is if mob is beating the slower/healer to death ( usually doesnt go that far ) but spirit of rage disc works well too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thorvak</div><div class="date">06-10-2004, 07:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">When a mob is incoming, hit it with an arrow, and incite as soon as it is in range.  If you have time to get off another arrow before it gets to you, the better.<br />
<br />
I play both a 65shm and a 65 enc, and i know how frustrating it can be to try to hold slow aggro off of them with droga weapons, especially enc's.  Really, if you do the above, it comes down to the slower ~ not yourself.  For shm, they need to start casting malo AFTER you start melee attacks, then cast turgurs or balance after spell refresh.  With haste on, even w/o a proc landing, a warrior with no offensive aa's can hold aggro off slow this way with only CHoS/SoTB - melee aggro alone.  Enc's on the other hand carry a bit more aggro on debuff/slows.  Tash is fast cast, and brings more aggro than malo - so if an enc is casting tash fast on incoming under the same situation they are going to get hit.  If on the other hand the enc waits a good 2 seconsd, casts tash (faster cast, dont lose much time over malos waiting then casting) then immediately boggles and slows - they will not pull aggro.<br />
<br />
Even with droga calibur weapons it is possible to hold aggro off debuffers w/o landinga  proc ~ if a shm/enc in a group continually pulls aggro off you at the initial debuff, THEY should be casting debuffs a few seconds later.  If you encounter a debuffer that is doing this, ask him to start standing within melee range of the mob when he slows - yes, he will gain proximity to the mob - but you will be able to get it off of him faster, and also gain the ability to /shield them easier - and alot of the times bringing their attention to their aggro fixes the problem anyhow.</div></div><hr />
