<br />
April 28th, 2004 <br />
---------------------- <br />
<br />
Headlines! <br />
<br />
- A new storybook has arrived! Make sure you read it to find out what Tondal is up to now. <br />
- A new adventure zone is live on Stormhammer! <br />
- A new adventure zone has moved from Stormhammer to Live! <br />
- What are the &quot;HOT SPOTS&quot;? <br />
- Plane of Knowledge open to everyone! <br />
<br />
<br />
New Adventure Zone goes to Stormhammer <br />
----------------------- <br />
- We have added a new adventure zone which should be a challenge for 2 groups of about 50th level. <br />
A party of adventurers is missing and was last seen working with the undead. Will you brave the catacombs to find them? <br />
<br />
<br />
New Adventure Zone moves to Live <br />
----------------------- <br />
- The adventure zone currently on Stormhammer will move to live servers. You can visit the Lost Pyramid of Galuuk Korr. This midlevel adventure zone will allow you to explore a monument from the lost elvish city of Takish Hiz! Now you must find what was left beneath the sands. Good luck. <br />
<br />
Hot Spots <br />
----------------------- <br />
Try out the new Hot Spot zones which give a boost to Experience while adventuring in them, in a similar manner to Paludal Caverns. The current Hot Spots are: <br />
<br />
- The Castle of Mistmoore (20th to 30th level) <br />
- The Lair of the Splitpaw (35th to 45th level) <br />
- Dulak's Harbor (40th to 45th level) <br />
- The Tower of Frozen Shadow (30th to 35th level) <br />
- The Gulf of Gunthak (35th to 40th level) <br />
- Hate's Fury (55th to 60th level) <br />
- The Crypt of Nadox (50th to 55th level) <br />
- The Torgiran Mines (45th to 50th level) <br />
<br />
These Hot Spot zones are generally aimed at characters level 20 to 51. The Hot Spot zones will shift from time to time, so watch for messages giving clues as to where the new ones may be. <br />
<br />
<br />
Plane of Knowledge <br />
----------------------- <br />
All EQ characters can now access the Plane of Knowledge whether they have purchased Planes of Power or not! <br />
<br />
General <br />
----------------------- <br />
- We have decreased load times when zoning. <br />
<br />
<br />
Gates Sewers and Vxed <br />
----------------------- <br />
- Rare NPCs in the Gates sewers and Vxed will not spawn at the creation of the expedition zone. They will now spawn after the zone has been occupied for some time. <br />
<br />
<br />
Items <br />
----------------------- <br />
- Skill percent-mods now work for Ammo slot items. <br />
- Grand Tunic of the Oracle and the Grand Robe of the Oracle have had a type 7 augmentation slot added to them. <br />
- Lungi of the Forbidden will display a robe graphic once again. Monks and Beastlords will be able to swap the robe in for a leather looking BP with the same stats by visiting Garath the Trader in East Wastes. You will be able to swap the items back and forth with Garath for your desired look. (Lungi? Lungi? What is a Lungi?) <br />
<br />
<br />
Spells <br />
----------------------- <br />
- Characters in illusion form can again be targeted. <br />
- Bull Rush is now a magical resist. Please do not use in a china shop. <br />
- Balance of the Nihil has had its Mana and Slow percentage increased. <br />
<br />
<br />
Tracking <br />
----------------------- <br />
- More NPC's in Qinimi now leave tracks for trackers to find. <br />
<br />
<br />
Firiona Vie <br />
----------------------- <br />
- The Shuriken of Eternity and Ton Po's Mystical Pouch are now no-drop.<br />
<br />
<br />
I am not sure how I feel about the &quot;Hot Spots&quot;  I like the fact that it is going to get people to go to zones they probably have not been to but on the bad side n00bs are going to leveling even faster.</div></div><hr />

eh, good for them, with incite, WA aa's, anger augments, most content is trivial for us at this point. (READ: us doing our jobs holding agro... healers job of keeping us up is a bit different) i think newbs being added to the game at the rate that they are adds a challenge to overcome, fun, and excitement.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gasmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">- Plane of Knowledge open to everyone! <br />
<br />
Yay just what I wanted, let everyone in PoK to be mge for plat and handouts! I made it a point to avoid bazaar because I could no longer zone in without getting a tell asking for plat or gear. I guess SoE saw around my sly trickery and had to make PoK open to all the beggers who can't afford to buy PoP.</div></div><hr />

And no named on zone creation for Vxed and sewers sucks. Going to take forever to get spells for guildies now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Galdaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If I had to guess I would say that it is off of Oasis or in the desert area of NRo or SRo.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>salandius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">keep in mind its an instanced LDoN advendure zone, you gotta get the right adventure from the camp 1st...<br />

I can't believe they actually responded to this so fast.  It took them about 2 months to figure out 90% of the players on FV had Grandmaster Satchels way back when.<br />
<br />
Grats to those that got a Shuriken cheap before the patch (heard they were going for under 10K in the past week or so).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If they get people to go to LoY more that's good IMO.  I leveled my 2nd warrior in LoY and they really are great zones for the people they're designed for.  If I was gonna level a new char now I would live in LoY, even without the &quot;hot spot&quot; exp bonus.<br />
<br />
Making PoK free is nice, although I kinda doubt there's that many people that don't have PoP by now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gasmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Not sure if this was a bug or what, but a few weeks ago I was in Gunthak with my lil wizzy twink soloing some skellis and zombies when some skellys that I didn't recognize the name of spawned, now for the life of me i can't remember what they were called, but they gave 12% xp per kill at level 37, there were only about 3-4 of them and I haven't seen them since then. Has anyone else had anything like this happen before?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Surlok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Nice to see them implementing bonus XP in some old world zones.<br />
<br />
Paw was my favourite place to level as a lower level,and I had some good times in Frozen Shadow to.<br />
<br />
While I agree that the loy zones are nice to lvl in I would have liked if they would have done some XP bonuses in some other old zones rather than only just 3 then a bunch of loy zones....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Great another place to PL twinks.</div></div><hr />

Somehow I think EQ would have been a better game if ZEMs had never been introduced at all.</div></div><hr />

I like how they can add more LDoN, and are adding more LDoN for free.<br />

I think that it won't really make &quot;noobs&quot; level faster. Most of these places take work to get to, as you may forget. Billy the Barbarian  isn't going to like it when dervishes kill him outside of ToFS because he can't find the entrance. /shrug</div></div><hr />

Can't make anyone go to your shit for content zones any other way, so lets make it so 5 kills gets them a level!<br />

<br />
Only reason I bitch about that expansion is because I had to own it to run my guild with any sort of efficiency.<br />
<br />
That's bullshit right there sir.  The zones?  Eh, not my cup of tea, but if they had to be installed on my computer against my will, I'm not a happy camper.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">LoY zones are pretty good, some even at 65. At least for a group of friends or a family guild, you can raid Inny and get some nice raiding learning.<br />
<br />
All the expansions had that Haass, PoP had the Raid thing, which was much worse than the  LoY Guild tool, because the raid tool was totally necessary,  you could live without the Guild Tool, it didnt affect your daily playing much, unless you were some kind of Guild Administrator.<br />
<br />
But if half your guild got PoP right when it come out, and for some reason you couldnt, you would have been left out of Raid structures till you had it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Redcloud</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Looks like a forced feeded sale of LoY.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Goradain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">One message they forgot to add to the patch message.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because we have now allowed access to PoK even without paying for PoP we have intentionally added coding errors to the zone that will cause your computer to crash if you remain here too long.  KK Thx!  Please drive through.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">All they have to do to make LoY worthwhile is add some damn ports! Why do you think half of Luclin is empty all the time.<br />
<br />
I happen to like LoY.  Some of the zones are pretty cool.  But I have to agree, the guy who came up with the idea that you have make long ass invis runs through a literal ton of mobs to get from point A to point B pretty much ensured that only the boldest people will bother.   The experience is okay there, but there are other places where it's faster.  And the loot isn't bad, but it's not so good as to be a real enticement.  Even the plat drops aren't bad at all in someplace like dulak, except you can go to sebilis and do as well or better.  And it's far easier to get to.<br />
<br />
Heck in Nadox there is even a trap door that as far as I can determine can only be opened from one side.  You can go through it one way, but it won't open from the other way.  You end up having to exit the zone by a completely different path which of course goes through a, you guessed it, ton of mobs.<br />
<br />
Edit:  Oh and CRs there can really be a pita.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I found out that you can actually just walk right thru the door on either side of it.  I did not belive this when I was told that but all you do is open it from the temple side then let it close and then walk back thru it.  I watched many Droodz do this since then pulling the brood mother (when she spawned) to the zone line to solo her.<br />
<br />
I love the whole LOY zone thing back when I played my mage. Have not spent much time there with my warrior but it was fun for family type guild and friend grouping.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I did not belive this when I was told that but all you do is open it from the temple side then let it close and then walk back thru it.<br />
<br />
Interesting if true.  Perhaps they changed something recently because just a few days ago I spent a good 10 or 15 minutes with two toons attempting to click it open, walk up the stairs through it, and just about everything else I could think of including trying to jump through the door.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Gyzz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I'm with the crowd that actually enjoys the LoY zones.  I've spent a virtual butt-load of plat on Invis potions for both myself and my cleric, but it beats dealing with the troglodytes that usually inhabit the Tier 1 planes.  <br />
<br />
I'm a bit confused by the level ranges that they mention for all of the Hot Spot zones.  For example, it lists Hates Fury as 55-60.  Is that just the optimum level to hunt there, or do you actually have to fall within that range to receive the exp bonus?  Just curious.<br />
<br />
-Gyzz</div></div><hr />

Kinda similar to what they did with GoD...</div></div><hr />
