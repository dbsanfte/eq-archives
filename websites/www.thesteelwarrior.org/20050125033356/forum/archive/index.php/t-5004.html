<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ahz</div><div class="date">12-31-2003, 12:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is similar to other threads, my apologies.  I'm confused about the best way to go with my weapons selection. I have a reasonable answer and I don't like it :-D<br />
<br />
Like others, I use a CHSD in the on-hand, and currently a non-aggro weapon in the off-hand, either the 16/19 DoM, or 13/20 primal, or 14/18 claw.  It's all in the Magelo.<br />
<br />
When I got the 16/19 Dirk, I thought I'd be a Damage Dealing Machine.  And in fact, my DPS went up noticably.<br />
<br />
Then I started doing Hard LDoNs, and I couldn't bear the brunt of 950 pt ripostes, so I whipped out the GSoT and Frostreaver, and found that in these harder places, I turned out 20 to 30 more DPS with these 2h weapons than the 1h weapons I was using.  I hold aggro well enough.<br />
<br />
So, it seems my 2300 points spent on the Dirk are... wasted. Clearly not what I want to hear!<br />
<br />
Does 75 DPS sound reasonable for the CHSD and the Dirk?<br />
Does 100DPS sound reasonable for the GSoT?<br />
<br />
Has it all degenerated to the point that the aggro-producing high DPS GSoT is the answer?  Why do I need these 1h weapons at all?<br />
<br />
Now finally, with that rambling stream-of-consciousness background info, my question is, where should my next batch of LDoN points should go?<br />
Anger 3 on CHSD?<br />
Anger 3 on GSoT?<br />
Anger 3 on the Dirk (Good points being thrown after bad?)<br />
Anger 3 on 2h Epic? (the ratio isn't bad, and it will have 2 Anger procs... and unlike Stun, they won't nerf the Anger procs. After a proc or two, I can swap it out with anything I want)<br />
<br />
I also can make 2 reasonable armor upgrades from Miragul.<br />
<br />
Blah.  It was so easy before LDoN, when I wasn't getting drops. :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">12-31-2003, 01:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Parse it. I think you will be surprised. All offensive AA being equal, 13/19+16/19 will most likely outdamage a GSoT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">12-31-2003, 01:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">EDIT: Bah, you said Cord Hilted Spike Driver?<br />
<br />
Forget what I wrote. I thought you said Copper Hammer.<br />
<br />
Hmmmmmmmm. That is a quandry. I think you'll be fine putting an anger proc on either of your 1handers. That's pretty good aggro there. <br />
<br />
One side question though ... why'd you do the dirk instead of the club? 16/19 on a piercer ... is it really that much better than 16/20 club?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ahz</div><div class="date">12-31-2003, 02:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">With all apologies to any ladies present, I would refer the right honorable Superchum to the GIANT FLUORESCENT PINK DILDO (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=4263&amp;highlight=dildo)  discussion :-)  <br />
<br />
In summary, the club looks like ass - like a goranga club.  I just couldn't go there.  And I thought the Dirk was a better weapon even with a little ATK loss.<br />
<br />
And I DID parse the logs, and got a TON more DPS with the Frostreaver or GSoT.   Is EQCompanion a highly regarded log parser?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sam DeathWalker</div><div class="date">12-31-2003, 02:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh... This argument will go forever....<br />
<br />
All logic points to the 1000pp ish GSoT with Aug 3 as being yur best bet.<br />
<br />
BUT Teh MIGHTY DEATHWALKER would not consider such cheaps junks regarless of its superior DPS.<br />
<br />
&quot;nerf of Stuns&quot; is speclative at best. <br />
<br />
I mean if you want to go for pure DPS and acceptable to good Agro and way less riprosate damage then the GSoT with Anger 3 is the way to go.<br />
<br />
If you want Looks, Bragging ability (WooT Me I am so Uber I have a BoC in offhand!), Better agro, and stats but worse DPS, and way more riproate damage then yur 2handers (or mine) is the way to go. <br />
<br />
I just value Looks and Bragging and Agro over Less Damage to and More DPS... (I have a cleric to take care of the damage on me and wizards for DPS). <br />
<br />
You just have to list these six factors and figure whats more important to you. Some people will rate Status and Looks as zero, others will see them as more important. <br />
<br />
DPS                2H<br />
Aggro             1H<br />
Status            1H<br />
Defense          2H<br />
Looks              1H<br />
Stats               1H<br />
<br />
<br />
Actually looks to me like the 1H have da edge but....</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">12-31-2003, 03:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you are getting good enough agro, and better DPS with GSoT or Frostreaver, and are concerned about ripostes, then certainly that is what I would think about putting Anger 3 on.  I would suggest tho that with a new expansion coming out in 2 months, and you say you are getting enough agro, maybe hold off a bit and wait and see what is available from the expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ahz</div><div class="date">12-31-2003, 04:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;nerf of Stuns&quot; is speclative at best.  <br />
<br />
Absolutely.  I have no evidence whatsoever that this will occur. However, with the warriors shrieking about the pallies' &quot;aggro lock&quot;, and said lock being indisputable, I would think that stun aggro could get an adjustment.  Imagine if we got our wishes granted - and our stun weapons quit being superb aggro weapons... The irony is overwhelming.<br />
<br />
I think waiting on the melee changes, and the new expansion, would prolly be wise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">12-31-2003, 08:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">And I DID parse the logs, and got a TON more DPS with the Frostreaver or GSoT. Is EQCompanion a highly regarded log parser? I have never been a big fan of EQCompanion so I would certainly double check your results. Got to the Katta banker some time and parse your set ups unhasted for a couple hours each. I parsed 15/20+14/18 vs. 35/24 and the results where rather suprising, the 2h was only 6 DPS higher for a huge decrease in agro. BTW - you might try YALP (popular, but I have never used) or EQParse (I like this one a lot) to parse your logs. Maybe EQCompanion has improved from when I tried it, but I was not impressed with the results at the time.<br />
<br />
I just don't think that the DPS a 31/30 or 42/43 2h weapon is going to do is nearly enough to consider the loss of HP and agro. Best case with 2h weapons, you can end up with 1 stun+1 anger proc, while with your 2h set up you can end up with 1 stun+2 anger procs as well a lot more HP.</div></div><hr />
