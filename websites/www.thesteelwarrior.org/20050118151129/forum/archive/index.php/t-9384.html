<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sam DeathWalker</div><div class="date">10-15-2004, 01:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well it has a pro that is about as much hate as a Copper Hammer of Stricking (both have stun  but CH has 79 more DD damage), and does a ton more dps.... <br />
<br />
Is there a better one hander out there besides DBoW?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valnir Lanys</div><div class="date">10-15-2004, 02:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fleshbiter, BBoB, umm yeah theres better out there.  Besides that one is way too fast for me to want to use MH.  Also I see 0 AC on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thalzaar</div><div class="date">10-15-2004, 02:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This one make me happy :)<br />
Thunderclap (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=47256)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Love fast weapons in mainhand, get more use out of DB and more swings isn't a bad thing unless you overestimate riposte. Helps to round out proc rate, and do more dps. Because of the delay, I think that weapon is fantastic, but the lack of AC kind of sucks :P<br />
<br />
Thunderclap however just rocks :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frodlin7th</div><div class="date">10-15-2004, 07:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's a whole slew of great weapons for us in this expansion, and that Bone Rendeing Battle Sword is among them, that thing is hot hot hot.   Thunderclap obviously is hotter, hotter, hotter, but they're both awesome weapons, the likes of which aren't seen in Gates anywhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Snowz</div><div class="date">10-15-2004, 12:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Chaotic Strike line looks very nice. It's even better than Time Snap due to the -150 resist. <br />
<br />
I really hope there are some Chaotic Strike or and updated &quot;Anger&quot; (Darkblade) augments to be found, especially if our 2.0 does not have an innate proc attached.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neksnappa</div><div class="date">10-15-2004, 01:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The original weapon posted has 25 ac btw, seems like a few missed it.<br />
<br />
And just outta curiousity, where are all the time+ level weapons/items coming from in oow? RS raid mobs? or the keyed zone? Are any of them one-groupable or from MPG?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sam DeathWalker</div><div class="date">10-15-2004, 10:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Bone Sword comes from this guy:<br />

No doubt a raid but  still...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vamcoy</div><div class="date">10-15-2004, 11:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not bad looks like we get a few differnt choices this time around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frodlin7th</div><div class="date">10-15-2004, 11:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Rhorius is Quarm/Qvic level encounter, it's incredibly fun and great tank drops</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kinathin</div><div class="date">10-17-2004, 03:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Won a thunderclap the other night, but since we beat the trial with like 2 minutes left to go on the timer, and they allow you no extra time do your loot, I was rezzed in and booted out immediately after. No one got their loot that night, but it was an awesome win.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Celestias</div><div class="date">10-17-2004, 10:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Now that I think about it, thunderclap does look nice, so far no Darkblade anger 1handers out there :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomb</div><div class="date">10-25-2004, 03:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its nice to see that there are a few good choices available after GoD was more or less a limbo (can only say for pre Tacvi) with the one outstanding exception of the Fleshbiter.<br />
I think our 2 primary tanks will mourn the day a long time when they passed on the first Fleshbiter we got and it almost rotted.<br />
The warrior who finally got it is probably 1.5 to 2k hp and 200 AA or more behind them but was constantly stealing agro when he forgot to bag it.<br />
Cannot remember what they had offhand but both are still using DBoW's main and epic 1.5 offhand now.<br />
Unfortunately the fleshbiter is mostly retired now as the warrior having it plays eq2 beta.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CWolf</div><div class="date">10-26-2004, 02:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=70721 is a nice one too :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">warcry</div><div class="date">11-19-2004, 07:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">anyone actually had some hands on with this to test the agro on it?<br />
That low delay/ proc seems like it could be usefull getting quick agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Carnhus</div><div class="date">11-19-2004, 07:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=32714<br />
Not bad either</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ragnarz</div><div class="date">11-20-2004, 01:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a bone-rending btl sword(BRBS). Not only is it a fine option but its one of the best looking/unique graphics I have seen so far. It actually shines. If I had to rank it (not including everything)<br />
DBoTW &gt; Fleshbiter &gt; BRBS &gt; JOS &gt; EOE.<br />
<br />
I use it MH in EXP grps for agro along with a painsipper. Was using it offhand for tanking until I got epic 1.5<br />
<br />
The encounter in RCoD is fun too. Agro management is a lil crazy. Its a full raid really.</div></div><hr />
