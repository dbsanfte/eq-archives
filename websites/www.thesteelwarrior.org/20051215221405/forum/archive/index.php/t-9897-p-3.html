After you swing you cast Slam and say for whatever reasons it gets done casting after 3 seconds.  Do you have 1 second left until your next swing or 4?  That makes a huge difference so far as DPS is concerned.  If it's the former, then as long as Slam gets done casting before your next swing it's not a big deal because there is no way to do more DPS between swings anyway.  If it's the latter, then it's pretty much worthless while tanking.</div></div><hr />

Oh, it's pretty much worthless while tanking anyway, since you can be interupted during the &quot;cast time.&quot;<br />

Bong's right...additional DPS if you're not MT, and just happen to be using a fucking weighted axe for some reason.</div></div><hr />

You do have to wait for the weapons full delay before it hits.  You can chain cast slam, so if you have a 3.6 sec delay weap (like the warrior quest axe) and you have the rage to chain slam then you'd be doing more damage than if you just swung the weap on its own.</div></div><hr />
