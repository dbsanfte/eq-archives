<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>turkishbull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a confession to make.  A buddy of mine asked me to play his character due to the fact that he is missing a couple flags that I already have, if he wasnt on.  Well tonight we decided to kill MM and that was one of the flags he needed.  I logged him in and had this nasty, gross feeling all night.  I couldnt get over it.  I was playing a paladin.  I felt nasty.  But i promised a friend, and had to do it.  Im sorry, i feel sick inside for running around as a paladin.  What makes it worse is that he is from Michigan......./shudder.<br />
<br />
p.s. i did have fun running around on his horse though after the raid....damn those things are fast.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">heh ninja, funny or not that shit was tasteless.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Rylaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">PC on a funny bone? <br />
<br />
<br />
Priceless.<br />
<br />
In case you hadn't realized, that wasn't funny. :( <br />
<br />
Oh, and what's wrong with being Canadian? :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Since people thought the picture was tasteless, I give you a shoe-bike.</div></div><hr />

EDIT: The photo has been taken down because people get sad when they see it. It was 2 people, 1 dressed as a plane and 1 as a building, imitating the September 11th attacks. It had owned on the bottom. I thought it was acceptable, but y'know, you can't have jokes in the PC society we live in. Someone ALWAYS gets offended, kids. ALWAYS.  <br />
<br />
Listen you fucking jackass. Apparently you are to much of a god damnt Asshole to realize the significance of what happened that day.  You apparently find a tragedy such as Sept 11 funny and the deaths of 3 thousand innocent lives were just for your amusement.  It has nothing to do with PC it has to do with Humanity, empathy towards your fellow man in which you prove that you do not have any off.  You sir are the biggest FUCKTARD on these foroums and that coming from me that says something.  GOD if you lost someone in that tragedy you will be singing a differant song.</div></div><hr />

True I didn't lose anyone. But fine. <br />
<br />
Apologies to all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gharghael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I saw the picture in question, and I found it amusing. I didn't lose anyone in the 9/11 event, but I still am saddened by the thought of all of those lives cut short. Somehow I manage to have a sense of humor and a sense of empathy all at the same time... /boggle<br />
<br />
Aaaaanyway back to the topic of this thread:<br />
EWWW you played a paladin?! That's just...ugh..<br />
I order you to do 100 &quot;Hail, Rallos'&quot; and bathe yourself in the blood of virgin drolvargs. Then you will be cleansed of your wussiness.</div></div><hr />

 Gimme a Goddamned break.<br />

 In a world where guys like you laugh your ass off playing Vice City, tell dead baby jokes, play games like Medal of Honor for 'downtime', and flock in such droves to PvP bullshit that you crash the servers, you're gonna seriously give people shit over something that, had it happened in Paris, you'd be chuckling over to this day.<br />
<br />
 Yes, it was a tragedy. Yes, lots of Americans died. It's happened a lot in American history, and every other case, you get lameass jokes about it. Get over it AND yourself.<br />

 /rant off</div></div><hr />
