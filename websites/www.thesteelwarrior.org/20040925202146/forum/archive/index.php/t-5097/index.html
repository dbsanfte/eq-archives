However, a couple years back, while I was at a Ren Fest, one of my buds asked if I would check out his warrior twink when we got home. Anyway, apparantly some random dude overheard and broke out a minute-long story with EQisms, then left without saying another word. Quite odd =)</div></div><hr />

As I was just about to enter the city limits, I said to him 'zoning into town now'... he said 'huh?' (he does not play EQ), so I just said 'um, just entering town now, be there in a few minutes'.</div></div><hr />

My wife wanted to go horse back riding and was surprised there were no merchants or drogmors.<br />

<br />
When I am on a phone call and someone comes to me in the office I tell the person on the phone, brb afk a sec.<br />

My wife says to her mother &quot;I will send you a tell tomorrow&quot;<br />

<br />
I'm still waiting for myself to slip up. I know it's bound to happen soon. The weirdest thing for me so far is talking to a friend and his mom (both played EQ) and they said SoW (Spirit of Wolf) like what rhymes with &quot;cow&quot;. I say it like &quot;so&quot;.</div></div><hr />

And just when GH landed My friend with ilusion troll fell to the ground dead<br />
¿¿¿???  &lt;- ME<br />

another thing was my friend was driving from TN to visit me in TX and we were texting each other on our cell phones and when she crossed the stateline into TX she wrote /zone and do /who all Gemuse and I wrote back /ooc 65 Gemuse- cleric - High elf- Texas W00T!<br />

The other two guys were staring at us with this puzzled looks on their faces.  I guess we were talking too fast and used a lot of abbreviations like FBSS, SoW, KEI, etc.    :D   They had no clue whatsoever about what in the world we were talking about.  Its an insider EQ thing, lol</div></div><hr />

I say KEI like key but he spells it out K-E-I, whereas I spell out L-D-O-N, and he says el-dawn. I say Vel-yus, but he pronounces Velious all wierd.<br />
<br />
My girlfriend and I get a kick out of EQtalk in public. You get the funniest looks sometimes. I can't imagine what I would think if I was an outsider and overheard people saying things like:<br />
&quot;No, I was just sitting there and got hit by the fukn train!&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah, I killed him by myself, but there was nothing on the corpse.&quot;<br />
&quot;Jboots are not as fast as SoW. Do you have run3? How many AAs do you have.&quot;<br />
etc. etc.<br />
<br />
The worst thing though is how EQ invades my dreams. It's fukn unnerviong sometimes. Semi-normal dreams morph in and out of EQness pretty often. Nothing I can think of off-hand, but you know what I mean.</div></div><hr />

I kept quiet about it but was laughing inside.  We went to Best Buy later and as we walked in, I yelled &quot;Camp Check&quot;, a lot of people were looking at me funny and my wife was beat red cuz she realized what she had said earlier, but the kicker of this is that after I yelled &quot;Camp Check&quot; someone actually yelled back &quot;Video Games&quot;.........LOL</div></div><hr />

Another night I saw our boss coming down the hall and yelled &lt;boss's name&gt; INC to everyone in the shop.

...I yelled &quot;Camp Check&quot;, a lot of people were looking at me funny and my wife was beat red cuz she realized what she had said earlier, but the kicker of this is that after I yelled &quot;Camp Check&quot; someone actually yelled back &quot;Video Games&quot;.........LOL  <br />

<br />
Finally I headed towards his room and nearly crashed into him as I rounded the corner into the hallway. I pointed at the offending litter box and said &quot;Will you please loot that thing!!??&quot;<br />
<br />
haha<br />
<br />
My boss got a huge kick out of my one word response to a whiney user complaint which was: *sigh*. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>grumush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">Me and a few friends were all getting hammered on the wakiikii strip in HI.  Of the 5 of us 2 (me and my best bud) play EQ inseprebaly.  He plays a cleric and I played a wizy at the time named Sule.  Well one of the other 3 hits on the others GF and the offended suiter starts it up with the dude.  We are in the process of going to our car in the parking lot at this point.  Well my bud tries to stop the fight (I'm just sittin back laughing as this happens alot when a bunch of marines go out).  The prob is the guy is we were all so piss drunk he can't tell who it is so he pops my bud in the jaw and they start rolling on the ground.  I send the suiter home in a taxi and my buds sitting on the curb bleeding from a cut lip and he's punch drunk and booze drunk.  I tell him to get up so we can go home and he looks up at me all bleery eyed and said &quot;No man .. I need to get a heal off Sule .. I need some mana man /sigh I'm totally out of mana&quot;  it wouldn't have been so funny but he was all puffed up from the boxing match and bleeding and was totally serious .. so naturally I let him fall proceeded to piss my pants laughing with the others, then take him to the hospital to make sure he didn't have a concussion.  I tease him unmericifully about that all the damn time.</div></div><hr />

im constantly catching myself trying to use the word &quot;platinum&quot; where i should be saying dollars.</div></div><hr />

My girlfriend plays EQ with me ... and lately, I have been catching myself referring to her in emails and conversation as *Hiana* - which is the name of her druid.  I don't think she's calling me Doggabone yet, but it's impossible to be certain :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Warram</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">I don't know anyone in RL that plays EQ so even the slightest of gamer-isms that slip out of my mouth make people cock their head like a dog.<br />
<br />
Once I said &quot;Oh I totally owned that stoplight&quot; to my gf after making a late yellow. She was like, &quot;huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
I use the word faction all the time to describe what I think of people...nobody understands. <br />
<br />
What's even more awkward is talking about EQ on the few occasions I've called up EQ buddies and saying things out loud I've never once said before....like the name of my guild or a zone I've been to a thousand times. Very weird. <br />
<br />
KAY-noce</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>Vick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">I only know 1 person in RL that played EQ ever and he moved away and stopped playing so just like warram anything that comes outa my mouth like owned *quite often* gets wierd looks from my friends at college. even once i told my proffesor as i turned in a test that &quot;I owned that test&quot; she was like ok thats nice good bye. and every once in a while when i do something stupid i'll follow it up by saying muahahaha and that gets me some evil looks because no matter how many people are in the room and how loud they are they always seem to hear me say that. this is quickly followed by me leaving the room. <br />
<br />
Oh and wth is this pronouncing sow like so. theres a damn W in it for a reason.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>Kizef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">My wife and I both play. We have 10 or so RL friends and family that play. Everyone ALWAYS calls everyone else by their character name. <br />
<br />
Talking to my mother on the phone about my brother and I called him by his Character name... My mother knew who I was talking about (my mother can barely turn on a computer)<br />
<br />
Funniest slip was from when I was playing UO. My wife and I were walking through a hobby store and they were selling different colored feathers. I grabed a bunch and turned to my wife and said <br />
&quot;Sweet I was looking for some feathers to work on my fletching skill&quot;. My wife just stared at me. It took me a minute or 2 to figure out what her problem was.</div></div><hr />

I told him not to bug me cuz i have froggie train in sebilis mezzed and the cleric isnt doing his job properly and i need to concentrate cuz im lom.<br />

The typical rhey, /1 hey, and /g hey are very common on AIM for me. <br />
<br />
I play EQ with 3-5 RL friends and we stay stuff like Newb, Pwn, Woot, etc. all the time at school and now many people say it as well haha.<br />
<br />
In English class, we were discussing MacBeth. The teacher asked  about his thoughts as we was about to fight Macduff or something like that and one on my friends replied &quot;Oh, I am gonna totally pwn Macduff&quot; pronouncing &quot;pwn&quot; as pone. Was the best thing ever.<br />
<br />
My friends and I label people as EQ races and classes a lot too. (hot tan girl = &quot;oh she is def. a wood elf female rawr~&quot;)<br />
<br />
I have many times wished I could just port back home after a vacation or long walk :p<br />
<br />
One time my mom woke me up in the morning and I mumbled something about &quot;Is the spawn up? Is it time to go fight?&quot; she was utterly confused.</div></div><hr />
