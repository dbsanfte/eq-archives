<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Diarmid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This isn't really a warrior-centric question, but I thought I'd take a shot with it here and see if you all have any experience with extended range items.<br />
<br />
Will the extended range caster focus items provide enough range to keep casters (clerics especially) out of the AoE range of mobs like Xanamech or Grummus or Aerin'Dar?  Or do different AoEs have different ranges?<br />
<br />
I am part of a relatively small guild who is trying to work their way up to these larger mobs and was wondering if I should start suggesting these focus items to our casters? I have very little firsthand knowledge of these things and am hoping you can help me out.<br />
<br />
Many thanks and fight the good fight!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">ER items work from a % on the item. I believe most are either 15 or 20%. The bad news is that Cheal has a range of exactly 100, so the best ER items can only get you to 120 range from the mob. To put that into perspective, most AEs are in the 200-300 range. Except in the case of some PBAEs and mobs with a small AE rampage, clerics are pretty much screwed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bulbog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Different AE's have different ranges, look up some AE's on lucy and you'll see they have different listed ranges.  For some AE's ER4 items will help casters stay out of range but I guess I can't give you an exact answer cause it depends on the range of the spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grimmlokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">One thing to note on ER items: They only make the range/focus check at the beginning of the spell cast. If target is in range when you start and moved just out of range, it will have no effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Diarmid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks guys..sounds like they aren't worth the time or trouble. Appreciate the feedback...fight on!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">They're nice when you can set it up right, but get them if you're already going for the item in the first place for the casters.  I wouldn't specifically go after them in place of a better item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">sounds like they aren't worth the time or trouble ER is well worth the trouble. Most mobs get pinned against a wall or cornered anyway so it is unusual to move very much once the mob gets placed. This focus is particularly inportant for clerics since Cheal only has a range of 100. Lucky for clerics, that's a level 39 spells so ER2 or better will work. You can easily get everyone a Supple Scale Armband from KC if they don't have some form of ER.</div></div><hr />
