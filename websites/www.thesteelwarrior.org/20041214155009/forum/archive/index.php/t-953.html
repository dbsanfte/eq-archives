At the very least restrict the whining to a couple threads. There's no reason to have 3 posts about GD knight classes on the front page. 100 posts titled &quot;MAKE TEH TUANT WORK!&quot; was bad enough, now we're crying about other classes non-stop?<br />
<br />
 And of course me crying about all the crying is not making the board any tougher=P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varaho</div><div class="date">06-02-2003, 06:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Whats bad is one of them is a myth and another was started by a paladin :(<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: N/M more than one was started by a knight.<br />
<br />
It seems they were scared as hell of us and started bumping posts and starting threads to argue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goradin</div><div class="date">06-02-2003, 07:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't want them to nerf anyone.  Maybe some folks need to take a look at their play, attitude  and gear.  No patches in the world can fix the issues of some people's ability to find a group.  <br />
<br />
Getting a group relies on several things :<br />
<br />
1) Your gear -   You have to be up to task.  This can send messages as to your ability.  Good players often get decent gear or care enough to research it.  Or be awarded it via guild play.  Bad player does not always mean a bad player but perception can be a powerful judgement tool.  A LVL 60 warrior in crafted might send a what the heck is going on message.<br />
<br />
2) Your ability as a player - You must be skilled and no patch in the world can fix this problem.  Do your job even if it means adding DPS along a paladin.  Hold aggro if your MT.  Do your best and by means to do not suck.  People are often quick to blame the &quot;gimp&quot; warrior.  Poor play adds to this perception.<br />
<br />
3) Your ability to develop friendships - Np here for me.  I have friends to group with.  I have carefully nutured relationships as the course of my game play and now I have friends.  These folks let me tag along as friends can and will do.  Treat others as you want to be treated and act with honor.<br />
<br />
4) Your server reputation - If your a creep groups may be hard to find.  You get a bad reputation its hard to shake.  I seen people saw I am not grouping with &quot;him&quot; a lot.  Play with honor, do your best and do not whine in group!  Social value to a group cannot be measured and this ties in to number 3 as well.    <br />
<br />
5) Your class abillities - Sure we are not kings of aggro anymore.  Who is to say we should be?  We can out tank most other classes in terms of HPs and AC and damage mitigation not everyone granted as some have uber gear but most.  We can lay some damage down not as good as monks or rogues but better than you know who.  I am not saying that we are better than one class or another but we do have a niche.  <br />
<br />
If people only put aside their ego and used the strengths of what they had in a group instead of worrying what they don't have people would be happier.  And we would be regared as less of gimp warriors and whiners.  <br />
<br />
Sorry for typos, run-ons and to go Dr. Phil on you.</div></div><hr />
