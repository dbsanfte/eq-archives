<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telen</div><div class="date">10-25-2004, 04:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I found this info and got this drop the other day so I thought I would share it as I think this is a good aggro proc and a good alternative to doing lots of LDoN's for an Ykesa proc.<br />
<br />
In Bloodfields there is a mob called an ukun slaughterhound that is a PH for the Domineering Ukun.  The uncommon drop off the Domineering Ukun is a stone called a Bloodstone of Agony.  It is a type 4 aug with a Bite of Ykesha proc, which is a 50 dmg 0 sec stun proc.  Not quite as good as the LDoN versions, but close and should have the same aggro.  The common drop is an ok cloak.  We got 3 cloaks before getting the aug, I would say we probably spent four or five hours before getting the aug.<br />
<br />
To get to the mob from the DS zone in just run to the first open courtyard and just past the archway there is the first open area.  In the first open area will be the wandering ukun slaugtherhound, he will wander across both sides of the path.  Just keep pulling him until the named Domineering pops, probably about 1 in 4-5 or so.<br />
<br />
There is one other named in the general area, the Ikaav Slumberer, and the miragenist is the PH for it.  So you can pull both of those, the Ikaav Slumberer drops a decent clr/dru/shm belt as the common and a nice +2 dmg shield aug as the uncommon.  During the four to five hours there we also got the +2 dmg shield aug as well as the bite of ykesha proc.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bargran</div><div class="date">10-25-2004, 07:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">nice info. Just 2 questions :<br />
Do nameds drop some sorts of runes, and if so, which ones ?<br />
Difficulty ? think it shouldn't be hard, but never hunted in bloodfield other than our epic fight :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
Great, good to hear.   :)   I thought it was a good alternative to spending 500 adventure points also.<br />
<br />
The mobs are pretty easy there, they are mostly under level 55 as they aren't immune to stun procs.  Named are a little bit harder, but still pretty easy.  You can check my magelo, I'm 65 with just over 20 aa's, decently equipped.  I would guess you could handle tanking the named much lower level.<br />
<br />
I don't think any of the named in Bloodfields drop runes.   :(   At least the lower level ones and the one that drops the aug doesn't.  Bloodfields isn't a spectacular zone, but the ykesha aug is a nice drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drunder50</div><div class="date">10-29-2004, 06:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anyone know if that proc will work on mobs above 65?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kamidari</div><div class="date">10-29-2004, 11:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Depends on what you mean by work...  Will it stun them?  No - none of the Ykesha procs go above lvl55 stun.  Will still it generate good aggro?  Yep.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drunder50</div><div class="date">11-01-2004, 06:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Exactly what I was looking for.. Thanks..<br />
<br />
Got the aug over the weekend. Camped just outside the first archway leaving the castle on the right. Got it on the second kill. Was there maybe 1.5 hours..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kamidari</div><div class="date">11-07-2004, 03:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just another thanks/bump.  Not a big LDoN fan, so this was a nice alternative option for me to get another decent aggro aug.<br />
<br />
I got pretty lucky, I think.  Set up outside the castle as mentioned, and within 45 minutes, I had the +2ds aug and the ykesha aug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Athrias</div><div class="date">11-07-2004, 11:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Been camping this off and on, 5 Ukuns and 5 cloaks so far =/<br />

If it means anything to difficulty, I can solo it with a level 66 beastlord with 107AAs, 4500ish unbuffed HPs and a KEI. Takes a while, and a lot of healing and the use of paragon, but he's never threated to kill me before. The Slumberer is a different beast, and I can only solo her due to haveing nice resists. She loves to fear people makes it a horrible pita sometimes if I don't have the mana to fero myself. <br />
<br />
No runes drop, but it's decent vendor loot, okay XP (2hours/AA solo) with the possibility of some okay bazaar or tribute crap. <br />
<br />
As to the monsters, there's two &quot;tiers&quot; of them there. Tier one consists of:<br />
-An ukun fleshound<br />
-An ikaav miraginist (PH for the Slumberer)<br />
-A noc darklurch<br />
-A noc fleshletter<br />
<br />
All of these creatures con blue to a level 55, hit for a max of 250 or so on a beastlord and are fully slowable. They are pretty akin to fighting PoN or PoI monsters, and I can probably pull 3-4 at a time and live through the fight.<br />
<br />
The second &quot;tier&quot; of critters comprises:<br />
-A noc flashblade<br />
-An ukun slaughterhound<br />
-A twisted stoneworker<br />
-A subjugated stoneworker<br />
<br />
There fellas are a little harder. They range from level 60 to 62, are only partially slowable (though not very resistant), and hit anywhere from  350ish max (the twisted stoneworker) to 450ish max (the rest of them). I can kill these safely enough one at a time, but they will require a few heals or the use of my defensive discipline. <br />
<br />
Note: All of these monsters do seem to be stunable, as kitty can stun lock them by his chain casting of Spirit of Rellic. <br />
<br />
As to the named monsters themselves:<br />
<br />
-The Domineering Ukun has roughly 22k HPs (almost twice that of the 2nd tier monsters), has a max hit of 514 (on a beastlord), is partially slowable and is more resistant than the others, particularly to ice it seems *grumble* He runs at around 20% health. The Bloodied Cloak is his common, with the Bite of Ykesha aug being his uncommon and the mnk/bst/druid bracer being his really really rare item. He's not the most uncommon spawn, and is on a spawn time of approximately 23 minutes. <br />
<br />
-A Slumbering Ikaav is an enchanter monster that loves to cast Trepidation as well as rooting you. She has a slightly lower max hit (493) and a few thousand less HPs. Have some good magic resist or she'll send ya running all over the place. Turning walk on is a good idea when she gets into camp. The belt is her common, with the aug being uncommon and the bracer again being near legendary. <br />
<br />
That's about my experience with it so far. I'll get back if I learn more info.</div></div><hr />
