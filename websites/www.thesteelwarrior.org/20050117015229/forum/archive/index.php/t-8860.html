<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kudan</div><div class="date">09-10-2004, 06:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I recently turned 65 finally after long hard fought road and thought I had finally reached the end game and could start raiding, and getting AA's. Well it seems that lvl 65 is not near good enough for me to even get groups now. I dont know if it is just my server or something but now that I am finally 65 I am still treated like a newb it seems. <br />
<br />
The first question everyone asks is &quot;whats your hp?&quot; . I only have 14 AA's atm and non raiding gear but I have some decent stuff from the bazaar etc. Everyone says I am still too skinny. They all want 7k hp tanks, everyone wants to do hard LDoN's or the elemental planes, and I never fit the bill. I am still 2 freakin k away from 7k hp!<br />
<br />
So I thought I would join a raiding guild and leave the tiny family type one I have now to go see the world of raiding. Wrong again. Everyone is already into either Vex Thal or the elementals that raids in my time zone (central or eastern us) . So freakin many warriors that even if I go and spend forever trying to get the flags they require or do the Vex Thal key somehow  I could never have the AA's and HP requirements. <br />
<br />
I fully understand why the requirements are like this due to being swarmed with Warriors they need a way to stop the flow and can pick and choose.  <br />
<br />
Now going back to my problem even getting groups when everyone wants an Uber tank now days . I feel I need to re-roll something else or move to a entirely new server with less uber requirements.  I would really rather not give up on my Warrior as he is my main and the one that I had all the time and experience with. So that leaves my choice as maybe transfering.<br />
<br />
My question is am I right in thinking this way ? Do you see any future for a freshly dinged lvl 65 War in EQ? And what are the Warrior population / requirements like on your server?<br />
<br />
Any Ideas for me?<br />

Not everyone wants to do hards you can actually farm points faster on normals. That and save up the cash and try to buy better gear if you can</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">09-10-2004, 06:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think a new minted 65 war does have it tough--the extra damage you take weighs heavily aginst you. <br />
<br />
I could nto break into Hards until just reciently--at 1433 AC and 5521 HP. It sucks. 1) Grind normals. Put together your own groups. Know for a normal of all 65s a Bst is probably enough for slowing and good CC. <br />
<br />
If you are not having agro problems I woudl start by working on the 10 AC augs from BB. I woudl also look into the open raid org on your server, if you have one. The AAs and charm increase are nice. At this point my charm is about 18 AC, 90 HP. <br />
<br />
Don't be afraid to get into a group as a 6th.<br />
<br />
I do think the most important thing you can do is start your own groups and start getting yourself known as a 65 tank. What really sucks is that 70th is right around the corner. I would almost recommend grinding enough AAs for at least CS/CA/ND/PE (not in that order) and then working on leveling. <br />
<br />
Yes you can do it, but it will take some hard work. And resign yourself to not being uber for a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lathen</div><div class="date">09-10-2004, 06:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">/agree heartily with Kailyn on the suggestion to pause on levelling.<br />
<br />
The road to less frustration for you will be to grind the defensive AA's (especially ND3 in your case) while working on LDoN armor upgrades. Make your own groups where possible so people get to know you as a competent warrior.<br />
<br />
You'll be surprised how quickly your ac and hp start to swell.<br />
<br />
Good luck, Amigo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ariad</div><div class="date">09-10-2004, 07:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its gets frustrating but try not to let people get to you, and don't give up. The quickest way to upgrade is LDoN as other people have mentioned already. If people don't pick you up for groups just start making your own.  All you have to do is be a fair leader and take care of your groupies and you will build up a pool of people you can get together with every night.  It's not always easy to do, but if you can put together a regular group it really makes the grinding easier to accomplish and a lot more fun to boot  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">09-10-2004, 07:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah, make soem friends and go LDoN's nightly....it's the best solution for casuals and the rewards are wellw orth it; in terms of gear and augments.<br />
than move through LDoN. go hard later on down the road. than try some lesser PoP and similar targets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shredder</div><div class="date">09-10-2004, 07:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">BST slowers work great, and they can offtank with their pet in a pinch.<br />
<br />
<br />
Warriors have it really rough from the high 50s up to 65 until they get some better gear and AA under their belt.  Just hang in there.  Every class has their rough spots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nazgrub</div><div class="date">09-10-2004, 09:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think transferring servers is going to do much for you.  I'm in a similar situation, which is compounded because I play during off-peak times.  I happened to get very lucky because I knew a few people that are in a very unique guild and was accepted by the family.  That has helped me a lot and will continue to help me a lot.<br />
<br />
One thing I've personally noticed is that the more I help others, the more I get helped.  Almost karma.  I was helping a rl friend of mine camp VT and emp key parts for probably a week and a half.  In the following 4 days I recieved 300 hp worth of gear upgrades from various sources.<br />
<br />
There are A LOT of raid guilds on Vazaelle, and it seems like the family guilds have all shrunk in the past few months.  Those 2 things combined have hurt peoples ability to gear up through LDoN (especially a mid-tier warrior) because everyone wants to do hards and expects to waltz through them like they have an 11k tank.<br />
<br />
DERAIL :<br />
<br />
I'm so frigging sick of seeing beastlords and rogues and wizards with 5 aa's putting HARD LDoN only!!!!1111one!!!11! in their lfg tag.  It's like the other day I was desperate for a group so I accepted one in PoV, got there and one of the guys was LIGHT BLUE!!!!!!!!!  So, I left.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've noticed that too when I look at the LFG tool to see who I can round up to put together a group.  I won't do hards unless it's a guild group or people that I know can handle it.  I don't need the drops as upgrades, so I'm just playing for points.<br />
<br />
Those guys are probably looking at no drop upgrades.  Mages and necros are good DPS and handy in their own right.  If the rogues and wizards are being picky, skip 'em and snag the pet classes.  LDoNs are pretty flexible when it comes to party composition.<br />
<br />
The group I usually play with is rogue, rogue, cleric, druid, and whatever else we can pick up.  Root works well enough on adds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I love the LDON's.  I am not a uber tank either, but I do fine with grouping on normal adventures.<br />
<br />
Now and then I get asked to do hards or GoD hunts.  Last time I had a wizard ask me what my health and AC were before he would invite me to the group.<br />
<br />
&quot;I need a tank 8k unbuffed... you are the only warrior lfg right now, you can't come if you don't have the numbers.&quot;<br />
<br />
So before I answered him I asked what his health and AC were, and how well he held aggro.<br />
<br />
.... at least I don't get stupid questions from wizards anymore...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frostpaw</div><div class="date">09-11-2004, 05:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I noticed you have Cipher of Veeshan on your belt, try and get some mileage out of being keyed by doing the quests in VP. Very very nice items.  Getting the key is the only raid element involved with getting these quests done (except the ring i think). Anyway, definately worth looking into.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Timothian</div><div class="date">09-11-2004, 07:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">When I get quized on hp/ac, I usually do not tell them and skip the group unless it is someone I know or someone that I know to be a well progressed player.  I do this because I find it annoying, and too often it is someone trying to do content that they cannot yet handle and wants  a strong tank to carry them through.  Last night, I had a 59 shammy asking me my hp/ac to see if I could tank for his group.  Just as others are selective about the tank they pick for their group, you have to be selective about the groups, a bad group can make you look terrible, and can be a waste of time.   (personally, I think warriors should start setting standards for mana, AAs, etc that we find acceptable for our group members).<br />
<br />
The harsh reality is that there is there is a lot of content new 65 warriors cannot tank due to their hp/ac. (I know, I can't tank it).   You will get asked this even if you are the only warrior LFG, or if there are 30.  The number of warriors on your server will not matter too much if you get known.  I finally am starting to get my stats up a bit (8300hp, 1500 ac buffed, 80 AAs) and am now can start to do some harder content.  I got here by following the good advice you see posted above.   Normal LDoNs, and being the 6th member to groups who already have a tank. <br />
<br />
Keep reading this web site, it has lots of great advice.  If you have time, browse the old posts too.  I  and credit the infomation here for getting me to this point in the game.  To be honest, I disagreed with many of the posts when I was in my 50s, and low 60s, but it all is making sense now.<br />

Granted there was a high level cleric but the other members were around my level.  I am sure you would have no problem tanking PoV.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">09-11-2004, 03:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh and a bit more... I would probably work CS/CA before ND--the logic of HP over mitigation and avoidance is based on the idea that you would be fighting things with AEs. Since you aren't going likely to be facing many AEs soon I would go CA/CS 1 &amp; 2 (which ever you perfer first) then ND1 and PE, then finish off CA/CS. <br />
<br />
The other suggestion I have is that you reply to HP queries with you defensive AAs too.</div></div><hr />

Someone above suggested making a circle of friends - I agree completely.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As others have said, LDON gear is great. go for the 1492 breastplate in nro, and I would suggest getting some 760 point EF armor just so you can built up fast. (You can always sell it back later pretty much to get some more nro stuff). <br />
<br />
When yu get bored with ldons try to get orante drops in bot.<br />
<br />
-- Having said that you've made some pretty bad choices in your gear.<br />
<br />
I understand you're not raiding and that you might not have a whole bunch of bazaar cash - but even with the items you've bought, you could have bought items with more HP on them for the same cost (at least on my server). <br />
<br />
For example:<br />
<br />
What the hell are you doing with a cobolt bracer? No HP. - buy a new one (but keep the one you have for shrinks if you want).  Fine heraldic, anything, just get one with HP.<br />
<br />
-You have a 30hp breastplate. Now, I KNOW you can buy that architect BP from the nro ldon (or you can just get it by doing nro ldons they are common) for about 4k on my server. Those have way more hp (and sta) than your current bp.<br />
<br />
- Im pretty sure you can get somthing better than a 25hp range slot nowadays cheap.<br />
<br />
<br />
-- Your cloak has nice haste, but no HP, but I dont think you can do much about that right now.<br />
<br />
<br />
--Also: I notice you have 223 STA, Im not sure what that buffs up to, but I dont think it's 305. At level 65 my bard gets 4 health per STA I believe, so I assume warriors get more, lets say 5 (I really dont know).  Work on your STA until it's at 305, or at least buffs to 305 - that will be huge.<br />
<br />
basically to sum this up:<br />
<br />
---Buy new items to replace items yo have with low or no HP (bracer, bp etc).<br />
---Get LDON items (i would start witht he nro bp with 100hp on it and other stuff- then get EF legs, etc, etc)<br />
---Max STA (that includes getting planar power, but just max sta first)<br />
---When doing your 134234 ldons to get your new armor, work on those AA's.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Curdlex</div><div class="date">09-13-2004, 03:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Everfrost LDoNs are great and the armor is almost as good as North Ro.  Additionaly EF is where you get your hate augments.  Most EF armor is only a few ac and 15 HPS less at about a little over half the cost.  <br />
<br />
EF is also a LDoN where CC is optional.  2 Good tanks are usualy more then adequate if no bards or chanters are available.  Most of the time (like East Commonland) you can power your way through.  I enjoy setting groups up for EF (ESP since I have a Shaman and BST friend who is always group with) Just need a healer and I can usualy adjust the group from there.  <br />
<br />
So my advice is go to EF get a healer (Cleric or Druid) and slower then make another warriors day by inviting him to Tank Mezz. After that just see whats available (remember necros at this level can mezz those skellis)<br />
<br />
For NRO LDoNs (65) remember that mages were made for it (Higher nukes against summoned, mezz 80% of the mobs, even charm)<br />
<br />
This is from my experience and other may have better advice.  Don't be afraid to fail.  After making a few groups you really get a feel for what class combinations work.</div></div><hr />
