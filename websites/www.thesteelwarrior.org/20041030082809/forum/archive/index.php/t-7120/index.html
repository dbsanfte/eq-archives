<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gnomos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK, now we know BoC has no proc mod, and BBotE has a 65% mod.  So, BoC procs 2/minute, BBotE procs 3.3 times a minute. Their ratios are nearly identical, BoC avoids riposte better, but which one is really better for aggro?<br />
<br />
The proc on BoC is Enraging Blow, which increases hate by 700, X2 is 1400 a minute.  1400/3.3 = 424, so, if the proc on BBotE generates more than 424 hate, then BBotE is better for aggro.  Since the proc rate bonus doesn't affect augments, BBotE gives no special benefit if you slap A3 on it.<br />
<br />
I checked Lucy for hate on Sanity Warp, and couldn't find any info, it's effect is a 0 second stun, which generates whatever it generates, nobody seems to know for sure.<br />
<br />
So, which is better?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'd say BoC would be better.<br />
<br />
1400 Hate &gt; 3.3 Sanity Warp procs imo.<br />
<br />
Plus the stats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dubb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">A warrior I used to be guilded with owned both and gave high praise to BBotE and swore it was better than BoC. He was using BBotE + something else (got rid of BoC) before he got a blade of war. This was before AngerIII augments.  I've player a warrior with BoC, but never BBotE, so can't compare personally from that end. But I'll say that I always had lots of problems watching my aggro when warriors I was guilded with all used BoC, definitely more than I had with him and his BBotE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Omnus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The stats on the boc make it an all round better item. If I were tanking a raid mob I would rather maihand a boc. But in groups I would use a bbote because the agro on the proc is about 450 so you are looking at being pretty even with the boc over time, but more chances to proc means more battles that you will proc quickly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I personally used a bbote/chsd untill I got a blade of war, I had an 75dd augment in my bbote and liked the performance.<br />

It's a good weapon for us, but I doubt it is better then BoC's overall ability</div></div><hr />

Im not a parser scientist or anything (dont know the amount of hate generated by BBotE proc) so i dont have any data to support my decision, but thats what I've chosen to do.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Well, lets put it this way. <br />
<br />
If you had a weapon that procced once a minute, but procced 2k hate, or you had a weapon that procced 10 times a minute for 200 hate, which would you pick?  Warriors have problems with early aggro, not with aggro over time, and an increased proc rate that ends up evening out over time will benefit you more.<br />
<br />
If I could get my hands on a Blasphemous Blade, I most certainly would ditch a BoC for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">/agree Haass<br />
<br />
Over time you would get the same amount of hate from both weapons, so for long term agro, its a toss up, use what ya got. However, warriors don't have problems with long term agro, the problem is with early agro. A weapon that procs more is more likely to proc earlier, even if the amount of hate generated is less. BBotE is a better weapon for the increased proc rate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm sure they can take aggro from a warrior, it certainly isn't anything the be proud of, that's for sure.<br />
<br />
But the VAST majority of warriors will tell you that once they get going, aggro isn't a problem.  It's the early seconds/minutes of a fight where the debuffers are doing their thing where it's crucial that a warrior lock down aggro so that the group survives the encounter.<br />
<br />
That by itself is far more important than a necro that doesn't feel like FD'ing.</div></div><hr />

I'm far from ubber and I'm not running around with 10K+ hps yet (9300ish so far fully buffed) but the speed at which it hits seems to hurt. The dam thing swings so fast I seem to get riposted more. Its not a good trade off when i hit for 50-100 and get riposted back for 1kish with disc.  But in exp groups or things like Bot towers I think this rules over BoC, of course I don't have BoC and actualy passed on it once because I was happy with what I had (not a greedy person)</div></div><hr />

I have had a BBoTE for nearly what, hmm 8 months now.  I popped an Anger 3 aug into about as soon as I got it and love it for agro.  A few months ago I recieved a BoC as a Guild Hand-me-down (the warrior who gave it to me had just looted a BF).  Now since the guild rule is not to aug the BoC's (so crap doesn't come up about it when time to turn them in) my off hand BoC doesn't have the benefit of an anger aug in it, but I love my BBoTE and it is great agro for me :)<br />
<br />
Of course, if I could get my hands on a Hategiver (would like it for the AC in off hand over the BoC - would keep BBoTE in mainhand between those 2) or a Bloodfrenzy (like, doh! A3 and mainhand!) I would.  But, with a BBoTE and BoC I seem to do purty well :)</div></div><hr />

 I call bullshit. Unless you don't have a haste item at all, there is no way that a 14/18 beats a 15/20 with an EB proc offhand. The ratio is only slightly better, and no proc vs EB is a sure loser. You are wrong.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Although i agree with the idea that more frequent procs is nice to gain initial aggro, id have to say stats + overall aggro makes BoC better.<br />
<br />
If BBoTE has just enough hate on the stun to equal the same hate output from the proc as EB due to its modified proc rate, overall it still generates less hate from procs.  This is due to how procs stack - if you put anger3 in a BoC and anger3 in a BBoTE, the anger3 would go off more in the BoC.  The weapons initial proc making a successful check more means the weapons secondary proc does not check as much.  Now, considering, on average its only 1.3 times per minute that your missing a proc check, but it exists ~ just preference.</div></div><hr />

Sorry it has taken me so long to reply been too busy at work to post, you hit the nail on the head, i had no other haste, when i got the windspeeder i dropped my silvery belt of contention (21%) for a putrid belt i had sitting in the bank. Having the 2 of them 13/17 BBote and 14/18 windspeeder with anger 2 augs does get me better aggro than the  bbote and Boc with the 21% haste, i borrowed a cof from a friend and tested the BOC and bbote, and ended up swapping the windspeeder back in caus that extra 5% haste sure as hell made a difference. I really didnt think it would, but i averaged  an extra 2 to 4 anger 2 procs on top of the bbote proc per fight with the 41% haste from the windspeeder than i did with the BOC/bbote combo.<br />
<br />
Sorry if u dont agree, is just what i found from using them all, and testing out various combinations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Stun = 400 <br />
EB = 600 <br />
<br />
From Procs WA0 : <br />
BBoTE = 400x 2 x 1.65 =  1320 / minute<br />
BoC = 600 x 2 1.00 = 1200 / minute<br />
<br />
From Procs WA5<br />
BBoTE = 400 x 2 x (1.65+0.5) = 1720<br />
BoC = 600 x 2 x (1.00+ 0.5) = 1800<br />
<br />
So just on based on procs, BBoTE will generate almost the Agro of the BoC.<br />
Even if its 1720 vs 1800 the proc bonus means that the agro will be better spread out.<br />
Which will result as the feeling &quot;better agro&quot;<br />
<br />
Now 13+1/17  vs 15/20 is a no brainer.<br />
BBoTE = 0.77+ ratio<br />
BoC = 0.75 ratio<br />
<br />
Just based on the ratio BBoTE is better than the BoC.<br />
I wont forget to mention that the speed difference is in favor of the BBoTE too.<br />
<br />
<br />
So what do we have ?<br />
Almost Exactly the Same Hate Per Minute.<br />
A much better proc rate, that assures a minimal &quot;no proc&quot; series.<br />
A ratio that is better even without the elemental damage.<br />
A sheer speed that helps even more.<br />
<br />

I'm not even sure this is even true in reality, despite the maths.<br />
I dont see the Anger3 on BBoTE+A3 procing that much less than the Anger3 on BoC+A3.<br />
Yeah mathematically it does make some sence, but what about the extra swings (58 vs 67).<br />

Double procs become a real problem when you have SLOW weapons.<br />
(Which means an insane proc per swing rate).<br />
<br />
As the weapons delay lowers, the &quot;double cancelled proc&quot; effect becomes less important.<br />
At some point it should be miniscule to be included into RNG generated variances.</div></div><hr />

Macenion, the aggro difference had to be due to some other aspect of the weapons.  Different haste percentages don't change how many procs per minute you get.</div></div><hr />

His example was a bit exagerated in my opinion, but the extra haste will be a big factor. More haste = more hits = more chances to proc, there better granularity there to increase the chance for a early proc.</div></div><hr />

  You do NOT PROC MORE WITH MORE HASTE. This has been said so many times it isn't even funny. Let me repeat it: YOU DO NOT PROC MORE WITH MORE HASTE. Your procs will likely be more evenly distributed, but YOU DO NOT PROC MORE WITH MORE HASTE. 5% haste will not give you more aggro with a windspeeder than with a BoC, especially if you have enchanter haste. With SoV, you will be capped on haste with a 37% haste item.<br />

  You didn't parse, did you? You just estimated from your battle spam. It's been so thoroughly disproven that haste adds procs that it isn't even funny. YOU DO NOT PROC MORE WITH MORE HASTE. You proc 2 times per minute standard primary, 1 per minute offhand. Augments are standard proc rate.</div></div><hr />

yeah, thats the granularity part :) yeah think we could all give two shits about proccing 2 minutes after contact, its the first few seconds where we have problems.</div></div><hr />

PS. Someone before said something about the hategiver, HG has no proc mod, so asside from slightly better ratio it wont produce much more hate then a BoC, a lot of people in luclin era thought it had more or less proccrate, but that was mostly cause they wanted to i think &gt;&lt;</div></div><hr />

I think this guy, at least, was trying to saying that the procs would be more evenly distributed, not that there would be more of them. <br />
<br />
In addition, 41% haste will have a positive effect on your swing aggro, although the comparisons someone did a while back leave swing aggro looking pretty mediocre. I'm always shocked at how effective my lifetapped GSo4W is tho.</div></div><hr />

to the person that asked if i parsed, no i didnt, i just used each combo for about 4 hours a day over approx 6 weeks before i decided on the best one for me. Maybe after i get a crapload of aa that decision will have to be redefined but as it stands with the basic aa (still working on nd3 - told ya i havent been playing much) i found over the time i played with wep set up, that i got more bang for mah buck with the bbote/Windspeeder setup with the anger 2 augs i could afford in each wep. i could grab aggro at the start of the fight and not lose it with this set up, yet with the same group of people  i would have a shitload of trouble getting aggro at the start of the fight without the windspeeder equipped and just the 36% haste from the COF with BoC in secondary<br />
<br />
i aint saying u guys are wrong, but considering i only have what 19 aa atm, that is what i found.<br />
<br />
Sorry i started the argument, i just saw this thread and posted what i had experienced, didnt meant to create a shitstorm fo critisism with it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Romul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Stun = 400 <br />
EB = 600 <br />
<br />
From Procs WA0 : <br />
BBoTE = 400x 2 x 1.65 =  1320 / minute<br />
BoC = 600 x 2 1.00 = 1200 / minute<br />
<br />
From Procs WA5<br />
BBoTE = 400 x 2 x (1.65+0.5) = 1720<br />
BoC = 600 x 2 x (1.00+ 0.5) = 1800<br />
<br />
So just on based on procs, BBoTE will generate almost the Agro of the BoC.<br />
Even if its 1720 vs 1800 the proc bonus means that the agro will be better spread out.<br />
Which will result as the feeling &quot;better agro&quot;<br />
<br />
Now 13+1/17  vs 15/20 is a no brainer.<br />
BBoTE = 0.77+ ratio<br />
BoC = 0.75 ratio<br />
<br />
Just based on the ratio BBoTE is better than the BoC.<br />
I wont forget to mention that the speed difference is in favor of the BBoTE too.<br />
<br />
<br />
So what do we have ?<br />
Almost Exactly the Same Hate Per Minute.<br />
A much better proc rate, that assures a minimal &quot;no proc&quot; series.<br />
A ratio that is better even without the elemental damage.<br />
A sheer speed that helps even more.<br />
<br />
BBoTE &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BoC  nuffsaid.<br />
<br />
EB is 700 hate in my EQ version.<br />
<br />
Plus BoC can be sold, and you buy lots of water and food and dyes with that.  I probably spent about a BoC worth in Dyes so far..  :D</div></div><hr />

Of course it'd be unfair if I didn't mention that BBoTE also has a 95 DD(95 hate) included in the proc =).<br />
<br />
So its closer to 500 vs 700, not 400 vs 600(700 in my world)<br />
<br />
I'd say BBoTE is a better weapon simply for the fact that it procs more often, better chance for early proc, which is where its most important.</div></div><hr />

  I dun think BBotE is 500 hate. You're assuming that a non-damage stun is 400 hate. Because we're not 100% sure how much the DD portion is worth on a stun, I assume ALL stuns, regardless of DD portion, are 400 aggro. I tend to estimate 400, which is higher than most people but it also a very nice number to work with. I'm quite sure that a BBotE is less than 500 aggro per proc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
  That would prove or disprove whether the DD adds ANY hate, not how much hate it adds. I'm pretty sure that the DD portion does add SOME hate, but just like DDs in general aren't 1:1 damage:hate, I'm sure this isn't. It also doesn't verify at all the pure hate value of stuns. 400 hate is an estimate, and seemingly a good one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well i'd rough it out to be around there, and I tend to believe DD is bit more than 1:1, if you ever used a weapon like 4 Wind staff, sometimes early proc turns mob on you, and I don't think 75 DD can weigh like that, but thats just my perspective.<br />
<br />
One way you can further concurr to that commmon belief of 400 is if you used, say a stun with something like 100DD(A), vs a pure stun(B). If A and B alternate casting, but on the 4th B's cast, B doesn't ping pong the aggro back, you could estimate it pretty close.  But thats assuming DD is 1:1, and Stun is ~400.  <br />
<br />
Also wether 0.0 sec stun weighs same as a 2.0 sec stun could be tested using this. or if timer is irrelevant.  One thing I did notice during the last XP group I had, was I had a paladin in the group(In BoT).  When the puller would pull, the paladin would stun him once, using one of their 65 stunabble stuns, though normally i'd tell him to stop, I was observing the aggro generation.  The paladin was using a Witness of Hate 2hb thing, I was using a BoW. When the mob would come out of stun and come after paladin, I didn't taunt and just attacked it.  Many times even when my weapon proc'd on the 1st, 2nd, or even third round, it wouldn't turn on me.  My weapon is much better DPS potential, and even if it was my Anger III proccing all those times, it still doesnt seem to concurr with the ~400 - 450ish hate, since a3 or eb is 600/700.  So only thing I can think of is that stun timer increases aggro? I'm pretty sure it didn't have a DD component, whatever spell he was casting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wouldn't.  One Enraging blow proc is 700 hate.  One EB proc will hold aggro aggro thru a 1k shaman nuke, and probably A LOT more.<br />
<br />
There is zero reason at all to think DD's are on a 1 to 1 ratio with hate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">DDs are most definitely NOT 1:1 ratio with hate. Go to the wizards and ask them about it, they'll describe it in very good detail.</div></div><hr />

I have a few questions though:<br />
I am currently in the Luclin content and I expect to see a few, if not all of the weapons in question to drop.  I have been considering what to bid on, and what will work out best. <br />
<br />
I have decided to obviously hold out for BF in main hand, as I am second in line for one, but offhand still a question mark.  Since BoC and Hategiver are equal DKP in my system (and I could use the AC) I would have to go with the Hategiver IMO.  <br />
<br />
How does the BBotE perform in the offhand, with a BF main??<br />
Since BBotE and HG seem to be uber rare, I just might jump on either when it drops, assuming that BBotE is a viable option in the offhand.<br />
<br />
(Note: 2 Cursed Kills under our belt, many many more to come, so I WILL have thte BF for main hand, essentially i need to decide where my DKP is best placed for off-hand weapon.)<br />

  You know, except for testing SK direct hate spells vs stuns, which I recall having been done. Or anyone that's used a stun weapon... You can make a ballpark guess via parses and experience. To say that there is NO evidence is definitely stretching the matters; there is no *definitive proof*, but there IS evidence.</div></div><hr />

There are 6 weapons in the Cursed drop table.  He drops one weapon every kill.  I have seen no evidence that the bloodfrenzy is any lower than any other weapon.  At the time my old guild was killing the Cursed, we got two bloodfrenzies in 19 kills, and 9 goldenrods in the same time.  A rival guild on the server that was killing him at the same time was giving bloodfrenzies to warriors who had been in the guild 3 days, but only had one or two goldenrods.  In my 2nd guild, Bloodfrenzy was by far our most common drop, and we got 4 in 5 kills once.  We even gave one to a warrior who wasn't in the guild and just tagged along on raids occaisionally.  It's all random.  There are no &quot;rare&quot; drops, at least when it comes to cursed weapons.</div></div><hr />

<br />
One is indeed more credible than the other.    <br />
<br />
The first reason is that Sony themselves stated unequivocably, when SK's requested their hate spells be reviewed that the pure hate spells were not functioning correctly under all circumstances, and they were not going to do anything about them since in essence, it would be too much trouble.<br />
<br />
Second, there are certain conditions which are ABSOLUTELY repeatable and unalterable in melee tests that cannot happen in spell based aggro tests.   With melee, there is no way to be outside of melee range, there is a strict set of mathematial principles which exist.   You have weapon damage, and a damage bonus, and delay, plus any haste.   Comparing known against known.<br />
<br />
SINCE proximity DOES play a role in aggro (if the evidence wasn't bountiful enough, the recent statements about archery vs dual wielding for rangers state the case unequivocably), and it's been shown CLEARLY through the use of incite, that ranged incite doesnt' override *presence* aggro in some situations, it's SIGNIFICANTLY more difficult to &quot;parse&quot;.  Furthermore when coupled with Sony's statments to SK's that hate spells (and skills, of which both enraging blow, as well as incite/bellow/cry fall under) do not behave normally, it's impossible to &quot;parse&quot;.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, the minimum increment that can be &quot;tested&quot; is 200 hate (if all of the criteria are constant).   Since there is no method of viewing the code, the assumption is made that there is no &quot;per attempt&quot; hate added.  In other words, a raw figure which is essentially &quot;aggo based on performing a hostile action&quot;.    Since this *is* a factor for instance in Rampage tanking (in other words, without performing a single hostile action, one can remain completely clear of the rampage list of a mob, EVEN IF they're within proximity which would normally place them on the list of PC's to hit), then you will have to make an assumption (in other words a guess) that each cast of a terror spell is exactly 200 hate, regardless of whether that's how it's calculated on the mob, or what the mob's reaction and frenzy likelihood are.   There is a &quot;Hatelist&quot; and a &quot;frenzy list&quot;, which means.... one can have significant amounts of hate yet not be frenzied upon.   This is why a mob like Vallon Zek, or undead act differently than other mobs, because their frenzy list is calculated differently with different levels of &quot;hostile acts&quot; dong different things.<br />
<br />
I can guarantee you that a main tank on Vallon Zek has some of the lowest hate on a raid, being stunned for 2/3 of the fight, and FD at least 10ish times, yet he maintains frenzy on the mob, simply because Vallon Zek calculates his likelihood to frenzy with proximity as a larger factor than numeric hatred.   <br />
<br />
No, spell hate tests are at BEST &quot;good guesses&quot;.   There's no methodology which is adequate to compensate for the various variables, and since we know SO little still about what makes mobs work, and how it differs from one to the other that it's as I said from the getgo... the ability to make nice guesses, and not evidence.</div></div><hr />

On serveral occations I would proc 4-6times in a row with it... inside of one minute.  what makes BBotE very special is the quickness in which it gains aggro.  Due to its procrate you get procs much sooner establishing aggro earlier. with burst procs you can gain pretty sick aggro. When averaged out  I would say Bloodfrenzy was king only by stats. BBotE had roughly the same aggro as BF, and clearly out aggro'd the BoC.  The weapon is like a blender. fast and ruthless.  When I was playing with my friend's BoC in offhand none of the top warriors in my guild could pull aggro off of me, but for a brief second... Gotz in trouble some times too hehehe 8P.

You made the right decision hehe ... lateral upgrade at best from an offhanded BoC.  Mainhanded i could see it pulling ahead by enough to matter but not in the offhand persay.  In effect you'd have gone for an equivalent weapon with 10ac vs 50hp (not an entirely bad trade) and a much cooler graphic (the one real saving grace).<br />

&quot;Mainhanded i could see it pulling ahead by enough to matter but not in the offhand persay&quot;.  <br />
<br />
Offhanded to a BF, a BBoTE would be a lateral upgrade at best and not worth the dkp.  I'd have you check my numerical calculations, but you're apparently of the belief that stun aggro &gt;&gt;&gt; EB aggro ... which i find funny coming from such an experienced warrior such as yourself.<br />
<br />
BBoTE will win out mainhanded?  No shit sherlock.  You have roughly = aggro from procs (slightly less ... lesser aggro per proc but 50% more procs) and both a superior ratio and the lower delay.  Of course it will win heh.  Toss it in the offhand and what do you have?  A weapon with a .765 ratio vs a weapon with a .75 ratio and no dmg bonus from the swing and slightly less overall proc aggro.  I'd concede they might tie equally ... hence it would be a lateral upgrade at best and not worth the dkp.  Roughly equivalent aggro ... +10ac -50hp ... + 5 sta ... +5 str ... minus 15 dex - 12 saves.<br />
<br />
You, sir, need to take a deep breath and calm down.  You're awful confrontational about this.  Simmer down.  Is this really worth getting into a pissing contest over heh?<br />
<br />
Your argument belongs in the stun/anger3 thread not in this one.  Until you can conclusively prove that stun aggro trumps anger3 (which i still laugh at) i'll stick with the number that's been used for a good long while now ... ~450 (which feels about right).<br />
<br />
Check out the weighted axe test i pulled.... actually i'll copy it over here for ya to read.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u81"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p81">Before i quit everquest, however, i tried my weighted axe + anger 3 vs axe + yak augments.  Slow both warriors for a proc on 1 swing and tested with a 3rd party pulling in MPG, PoFire, PoInnovation, Vallon zek in tactics, Tipt, Kod`Taz, and even in Ikkinz.  Every single time aggro belonged to the other warrior (I had yak on mine he anger3 on his).  <br />
<br />
3rd party: bard<br />
We had a shaman and cleric with us as well as the duo of warriors.  The bard would pull a mob pre-slowed and let the mob hit him once or twice.  Both warriors would turn on autoattack from the sides.  Both warriors would get 1 proc + 1 round off.  One warrior had aggro .. the other one didnt.  Bard would mez ... cure slow on warriors and kill the mob.  Rinse and repeat 5 or so times per zone/mob-type.  It was obviously a 1 shot deal on vallon zek though.<br />
<br />
We both had all pertinent offensive aas.  Neither of us flurried on any pulls .. and we logged swing to make sure someone wasnt scoring a quad while another only swung once.  Both buffed 330 dex lv 70 and WA5.  I'll repeat it one more time:  every single pull the other guy held his aggro.  Anger3 vs 125 yak.  Mobs ranged from lv 50 all the way up to 73 red-cons with over 100k hps.  I cant speak for endgame gates or oow as i never saw them.<br />
<br />
Happy birthday Frod.  Mobs included xp trash from PoInnovation ---&gt; Ikkinz, as well as various named in WoS, xp trash in WoS, xp trash in MPG, and even Mr demi-God Vallon Zek (lv 73) in PoTactics.  Not once ... not ever did myself with the yak aug'd axe ever end up with aggro ... and yes we had misses turned on to make sure someone wasnt getting 6 hits in while the other had only 1 (for example).  We both had equivalent offensive aa's (all 2hander aas).<br />
<br />
In the tactics run we had a 2nd group on the side including a SK so we could actually run the encounter after the test (grats druid-bot and cleric friend on FT3 belts).<br />
<br />
Until you can come up with some conclusive tests proving stun augments to be better than EB and anger3 augments i'll stick with my numbers.  Cleric/Pally stun vs incite won't cut it.  Cleric/pally stun vs sk terror line won't cut it.  Go out and test the 2 procs against each other.  Maybe you'll find things different in Tacvi or Qvic ... maybe uber-end OoW as well, but certainly nothing that a casual gamer or non-hardcore endgame raider will ever see.<br />
<br />
Have a nice day.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u84"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p84">What difference does that make Frod?<br />
<br />
What i wanted to do was simple: determine which proc is stronger and to find if there was indeed a threshold where stun &gt; EB.  Maybe there is but i havent seen it yet.<br />
<br />
By putting it on a Weighted axe and then slowing the warriors (after removing haste items and spells/songs) i could guarantee a proc every single round.  IE: mob hits camp ... stops ... then each warrior gets 1 round and 1 proc.<br />
<br />
It won't make any difference what weapon it is on, this just provides for a fuckton more control because all we are looking at is 1 round + 1 proc.  The less we can leave up to the RNG the easier the testing is.  Logging our misses as well as our hits makes it almost trivial to interpret data.  DPS aggro is determined by dmg/delay of the weapon ... more swings per round = more aggro.  On round where i would score more swings than he ... he'd still have my aggro.<br />
<br />
I really don't think you can dumb down a test on this further than i already have.  If Apolyon had access to high-end gates i'd go and test it out there too, but i dont.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u85"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p85">Hi Apo,<br />
<br />
Your test = completely bunk, and I'll tell you why, the same reason all your other tests = completely bunk, you didnt' actually think though them.<br />
<br />
Let me explain a little something about the way that combat works in Everquest.   You see, there's at least 3 variables you completely fucked yourself on.<br />
<br />
1. Double and Triple attack is uncontrollable it's not possible to make a single swing occur in EQ on a test of this type, or to control the amount of melee that occurs in a single round.  Who fucking cares if you didnt' flurry, flurry isnt' the onyl way to get uneven numbers of swings per round.   The damage bonus on the weighted axe is so fucking unbelievable (157 at level 70) that a single example of a double attack, much less a triple destroys any idea of eliminating melee damage.<br />
<br />
2. Riposte, while lower aggro than a normal hit, is another variable which you cannot possibly control, and with a weapon with a 157 damage bonus is clearly a factor.<br />
<br />
3. Order of attack is anothr variable, and whether the 3rd party who pulled blurred prior to the engage.<br />
<br />
Your &quot;test&quot; was completely ass, like your necro test, complete ass.   Talk to Tastian, Beastlord Correspondent about the variable aggro of dots, he's parsed it extensively.<br />
<br />
I gave you the only possible method of determining aggro of a proc and that's... single proc - melee potential aggro, have another party using only melee potential aggro and subtracting, it's foolproof.<br />
<br />
To determine the best aggro weapon, I laid out the test, the only valid one around, I even have an open offer to anyone who thinks their BoC is godly aggro, or even similar aggro to a BBotE.  It's not even close.   The BBotE will destroy it every single time.  2 hours of continuous use will show beyond a shadow of a doubt which is superior in aggro and determining at 10 second intervals who has it will show quite nicely.<br />
<br />
I've got 100kpp riding on BBotE, anyone care to take me up on it?<br />
<br />
No Weighted Axe Flawed Hypothesis and further flawed test Homostromy, mano a mano, weapon vs. weapon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. We logged swings/misses/hits every single 1-round shot.  Every time the aggro was his ... even when i would log 4 swings and he 2 swings or something similar.  Point is no matter the times i landed twice or more the swings he did ... He still owned my aggro.<br />
2. WTF does riposte have to do with this?  Bard pulls and tanks a round and we attack at the same time for 1 round.  We're slowed ... auto attack on ... auto attack off.<br />
3.  Bard never once blurred on pull ... he's pull/kite till he got HoS to land ... then take a round 2 till we attacked.<br />
<br />
You wanna test proc vs proc?  I just did it.  My necro test didnt conclusively prove jack shit, and i never claimed it did.  This one on the other hand tested proc vs proc.  Not once ... NOT ONCE did the yak win out.  <br />
<br />
Sorry Frod.<br />
<br />
BBoTE will win out over a BoC mainhand.  I know this.  My tests just trashed the garbage you're spreading that stun &gt; EB.  You want solid testing yet you want to prove this btw 2 different weapons?  I've just shown you 1 weapon with 2 different augs and a controlled scenerio whereby you can test 1 proc vs the other and nothing else.<br />
<br />
If i still played i'd go fuck around with your fine steel yak vs fine steel anger3. But ... i don't so i wont.  Anyone here is welcome to test it if you're willing to spend a few thousand plat to move augs around.  My money is still on the anger3.<br />
<br />
All of this is moot though Frod.  The whole point is that the BBoTE is a lateral upgrade at best from a BoC ... offhanded to a BF in primary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u87"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p87">Anyways point is stun proc until otherwise proven sits around 450 hate.<br />
<br />
Run the math and you'll see that BBoTE proc aggro floats right around BoC proc aggro.  BBoTE's superior ratio and lower delay make it the optimal mainhand weapon, but this disparity decreases when you put it into the offhand.  Ratio alone probably makes it slightly stronger aggro, but it's a lateral upgrade at best from a BoC.<br />
<br />
It will not, as you put it &quot;utterly destroy&quot; a BoC either mainhanded or offhanded.  It's better, but not by an amazingly huge degree.<br />
<br />
That is ... unless you can back up your claim that Stun aggro is 1100-1300 ... in which case a copper hammer of striking trumps a BoC and is close on the heels of a bloodfrenzy.</div></div><hr />

I have to agree.  It's just random what pops up.  For awhile there, Saryrn was giving our shamans the fits because for another guild, TA was rotting.  Almost everyone had EoEs though, but the other guild had yet to see one drop.<br />

One of the warriors on my server used this combo until he replaced them with DBoTW and EoE.  This was all pre-GoD though.  I'd be curious to see how Sinister Strikes played into it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u90"><b>Dima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p90">Just did a test on this.<br />
Had a monk pull exterminater in qeynos to a corner where he beat him down for a minute. Me and my warrior buddy (Exact same specs for offensive aa's except he has veterans wrath - 324 dex each, ikkinz haste bracer each, close atk) pounded on him. afterwords, not using taunt or kicks, just plain hitting him. Monk continued hits. This lasted for 20 minutes, then the Monk FD'ed. Exterminater turned and started attacking the warrior with boc/shield. <br />
<br />
The warrior with BoC/Shield turned around and I started attacking exterminater to see how long it would take me to steal aggro, it took me 65 seconds to take aggro back from the BoC warrior.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, BoC&gt;BBoTE for aggro, but only by a little bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u91"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p91">Your tests did nothing, they proved you're capable of coming up with several flawed tests which you like to think are conclusive, but are nowhere near the case.<br />
<br />
This is ironic considering you use paladin stun vs your incite line as prooftext.<br />
<br />
Hold on to your theory on stun aggro all you want.  If the truth were anywhere near your theories ... even my &quot;flawed&quot; tests would show drastically different results.  <br />
<br />
Explain how they are flawed plz.  So far you've failed to show how this experiment is indeed flawed.  You have 2 warriors each getting 1 round + 1 proc off ... then looking at who has aggro.  It really doesnt get much simpler than this.  I'd be inclined to see it your way, but we tested this multiple times in each zone ... and tested a grand total of 10+ zones, a ton of mob types ... various levels going from high-green all the way up to red ... and all had the exact same conclusion.<br />
<br />
Ripostes don't factor into the equation ... the bard has initial aggro therefore there is no &quot;bonus&quot; to the warrior who engages .03 seconds sooner.  Swing inconsistencies existed, but even when it was the yak warrior getting more swings the anger3 warrior still held aggro.  The RNG played a minimal role in these tests ... and in the cases where it did it was very easily noticed and accounted for.  For Christs sake ... you only needed to monitor one round of attacks ... it's not like this is rocket science here.<br />
<br />
Basic skeleton of events:<br />
1) bard pulls<br />
2) bard slows on incomming <br />
3) bard takes 1-2 round and calls for assist<br />
4) both warriors (slowed) attack 1 round with no incite/kick/slam/taunt<br />
5) observe who has aggro and who's health is dropping<br />
6) cure warriors rinse and repeat<br />
7) check swing logs to check for major inconsistencies ... ie someone hits more than the other.<br />
<br />
There is a pretty significant gap btw stun aggro and EB aggro with EB taking the lead.<br />
<br />
One of the warriors on my server used this combo until he replaced them with DBoTW and EoE. This was all pre-GoD though. I'd be curious to see how Sinister Strikes played into it.<br />
<br />
I never said it wasn't a great weapon.  It is, just not that much better if at all than a BoC (which will work just fine anger aug'd to and past Time ... especially offhanded to a BF.</div></div><hr />
