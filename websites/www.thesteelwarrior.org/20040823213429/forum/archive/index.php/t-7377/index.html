<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Poipounder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is there a way to separate  mob &quot;other&quot; hits from group &quot;other&quot; hits in a chat window? That is, I want to see the mob hits but NOT the hits by the other members in my group.<br />
<br />
I have &quot;mob hitting me&quot; and &quot;me hitting the mob&quot; in a window on its own. Sometimes, when I don't see the mob hitting me, I'm not sure if because it's slowed or if it's hitting someone else.  I would like to see when the mob hits others in its OWN window so I know it has changed its target from me to someone else.<br />
<br />
Currently, I have &quot;other hits&quot; going to it's own window but it's sometimes hard to see the mob hitting others when it's mixed in with all the other group hits in there too.<br />
<br />
Or, is there an easier way to do this (know when the mob has switched targets)?<br />
<br />
EDIT: I know about /assist-ing the mob but was wondering about a chat window option so I wouldn't have to spam a /assist hotkey on the mob.</div></div><hr />

Make a hotkey for it and it will open a second 'target' window that is realtime and shows you whatever your target has targeted as well as their health.<br />
<br />
I love it to death.</div></div><hr />
