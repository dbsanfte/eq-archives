<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cister Battle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi there.  66 War with 18 aas banked after getting lr6 and ID6.  My question is for lv 67.  Initially I was thinking lr7 and ID7 with Origin (I know its somewhat a Fluff AA but no more gate potions at 300pp a pop and its nice to not always have to depend on a porter to get you out but I have been reading a lot of people saying Ambidexterity is damn nice too.  What is your thoughts?  I probably wont AA grind any until after I reach 70 which will be a while.  I have been reading the LR gives a whopping 1% avoidance which helps but definately isnt earthshaking.  Let me know what you think plz.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fenring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I went with ID7 LR7 and Press the attack, but theyr'e about to nerf press so yeah probably origin would be good, it's quite handy. The parses I saw that showed 1% increase were done on 12 mobs which is not enough by a long shot to be an accurate parse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zannuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm in a similar spot... level 66, with 10 banked for 67.  I bought LR6, ID6 and Delay Death 1 at 66... when I reach 67, I intend to get a buffer and grind more AA for abilities... probably the same thing, ID7, LR7 and DD2... at that point I'll be waiting for a few friends to catchup... I am not Elem flagged as of yet nor KT so my only option for exp would be Tipt/Vxed/Sol Ro or new zones BUT... if I pass 67 and go right to 68, it'll start to affect LDoN groups with 65s, or at least so I've heard... it already gimps points if you are 67 and the rest are 65-66... I've also heard rumors of only being able to select Hard risk advs after a certain point... so I'm going to finish my charm at 67 (about 50-60 advs away) and catchup on AA... then when my cleric &amp; chanter friend are ready, we can all grind thru 68-70 together, hopefully in Elementals  but we'll see...<br />

Dunno if that helps the original poster but thought I'd offer it <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Cister Battle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">What do you guys think of Ambidexterity?  Is it worth 9aas?   Is it worth swapping origin out or lr7/id7?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fenring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ambidexterity was worth it, but there are things I think come first, you should definitely get AE taunt before that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think i'd get ambi over LR7/ID7 or origin, but then again I wouldn't get origin either, I'm at 67 with 10 banked still after buying the level 7s, and am holding on to the last 10 AAs for 68.  Not knowing how much you raid, i'd say in general you'll want the defensive AAs you'll always use over offensive AAs that you might not always need (if you think you'll be coming across a good two-hander, with lots of OoW still to be explored, who knows?)  Looking at your magelo though, I probabaly wouldn't get any of those AAs though, and go for WA instead.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh yeah, didnt notice AET missing, that too :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Duskin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">AET imho not really needed for a long time.<br />
<br />
I got AETaunt after I had about 220 aa's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Daabu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">AETaunt is one of the best AAs a warrior can have and you should get it immediately.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bruenorg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">AET imho not really needed for a long time.<br />

<br />
If I had waited that long, I would have way more dead clerics and chanters under my belt.  I use AE Taunt ALL the time and I would feel naked without it.  Beyond any doubt, one of our main class defining abilities.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I just picked up AE Taunt last night. <br />
I have 59 aa's, so for me it was an expensive 5 to spend. However, if it'll keep the casters alive long enough to get off a Complete Heal, or an AE mez, or an Exodus, then I'll have done my job.<br />
<br />
I've been following Daabu's awesome AA ranking post for building up my abilities. I may take a slight pause to pick up the 14 remaining AA's to get the Marshall title. Why? As a reward for winning the Coldain War, which we'll be fighting tonight. I've been questing that one for over a calendar year, so I admit I'm not rational about it. <br />
<br />
Other than personal goals like mine, has the release of OoW given us any reason to deviate from the AA list that Daabu posted? In my case, I have CA3, CS3, ND3, PE, AE Taunt, and WA1. Before OoW came out, I would have said that next on the list would be the PoP defensive AA's, or Planar Durability, or Planar Power, etc. Has that changed for the warriors who are in my stage of development?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Cister Battle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Post said LR makes 1% avoidance based on the data he had.  What about ID?  If im to spend the pts on AoT (5) then that leads me with 12 left.  Origin 7 and either lr7 or Id7?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Fenring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">If you get Ae taunt I'd say go with LR7 ID7 and keep the 2 banked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Get AET as soon as you can.  Guaranteed agro from all close mobs is incredible and has saved my groups more times then I can remember.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Antaran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">omg buy area taunt.........</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">yeah i'd do what fenring suggested.<br />
<br />
AE taunt is priceless.  I'd hold off on all offensive aas until you have ID10 and LR10 as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">You need to get AE taunt.<br />
<br />
If I was any other class, there is no way in hell I would group with a warrior without it.  <br />
<br />
If I knew you had 220+ aa's without AE taunt, you'd probably just go on ignore.  Not needed my ass, the AA is the best use of points BY FAR of all warrior AA's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>GorfinML</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">aetaunt saved my clerics ass half a dozen time sin WoS saturday when he had to heal early or on a pull..it was the first AA i got when i was able to get class aa'sl, and sure dont regret it</div></div><hr />
