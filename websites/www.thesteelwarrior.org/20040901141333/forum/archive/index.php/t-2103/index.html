<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I did Plane of Sky as a guest of an allied guild this weekend.  There were two warriors there, both of us level 57.  I was the MA for the vast majority of fights, because of this, I got the first wingblade that dropped.  :D    By the time we cleared the island and started going after the spiroc lord, the other warrior had jumped off and logged due to RL issues.  We killed the stinking spiroc lord several times, and managed to get a MQ blade for the warrior who had to leave (most of the kills the jerk spawned empty handed).   I and our pulling team ate a ridiculous number of DT's (I ate alot of them, the pulling team got about half again as many as I did, the brave souls)  but....I GOT MY WINGBLADE!!!!!<br />
<br />
Now all I need is a golem ball and a couple of scales,  I can't wait to get 'em.  So, all that having been said, the point of this story is....DRINKS ARE ON ME!  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nice work bud. Good Karma on MQing that item. I did the same thing for someone on my server :) He jumped off due to LDeath.<br />
<br />
Comes around goes around. Well done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tugurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">We once farmed Spiroc Lord 20-25 times in a row. We just wanted to stock up on every possible wingblade so we wouldn't have to do it again. Got about 12 blades, and by the end of it were competing for DTs. I was MT and probably died 15 times or more.<br />
<br />
Grats on your blade! Have to say it's a great feeling falling into the ocean by Freeport after a successful Sky run.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kiya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Grats!!  Keeper of Souls and Bee/Bixie island are eternally on my S*** list.  I HATE HATE HATE those mobs!!</div></div><hr />
