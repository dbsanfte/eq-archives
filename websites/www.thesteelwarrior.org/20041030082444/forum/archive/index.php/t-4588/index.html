<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">On my server prices of most goods (in particular warr equip) has increased by a factor of 4-5 over the last 2 weeks.  I'm curious if the same thing has occurred on other servers.<br />
<br />
I had heard a rumor that a bug introduced a large amount of pp into the game (triggering inflation)...just curious what other folks have observed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Doggabone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">arf arf<br />

Aye, on Tarew Marr I have.  But it seems to be settling down some, although I never see enough high end gear for sale to really judge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>TearsumRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">rpgexpert.com posted a script back in October and some believe that had something to do with it. I've also heard that bascially someone discovered a new dupe exploit and is just duping the plat. Either way, the prblem is pretty bad on Rodcet.  Not sure what SoE can do about it, if anything, but I hope they can stop it because it's making worse an already broken economy. Not to mention the fact that its illegal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wouldn't go as far as to say it is ILLEGAL. Unethical, improper, and generally f*cked up, yes. But, not illegal.<br />
<br />
If true, I only hope they can backtrack and find all dupers, and ban their collective asses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Xenephex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Same thing on Ayo Ro.  Prices have gone up, some items are just no longer available.  <br />
<br />
I spend a fair amount of time in the bazaar during the day, and about a week and a half ago, I started seeing people auctioning stuff like 'WTB CCOM 90K, SoD 250 K, BoC... Bloodmetal ears, etc. etc.. ' <br />
<br />
Always more or less the same stuff and always high end melee stuff.   Typically about a million plat worth of WTB in one auction, and I've seen a significant number of different people doing this. <br />
<br />
Windblades have disappeared.  Bloodmetal ears went from 24 K to 40K and then have all but disappeared.  Last night I was on and there was no haste item better than SCHW for sale, whereas most nights I would probably see 10 or more  higher level haste items for sale. <br />
<br />
Maybe coincidence - maybe not.  For those of us who are non-guilded, non-raiding part timers and who rely on the bazaar for our gear, this is really disturbing.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>zigak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">the previous patch introduced a bug that accidentally gave the looter 20k in plat from killing a level 2 mob in a certain zone. there were about 8 of these level 2 mobs, with a 6 minute refresh time so a certain person would zone in, kill these sharks get about 120k every 6 minutes, hence the inflation. btw this was fixed i think 2 days after it was introduced. it was like xxx has looted 2 platinum 5343958394834 gold and 34983593483943 silver</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>nota</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yes. Much better Tearsum =)<br />
<br />
and  Xenephex, I am also on ARo. I saw windblades go up to near 30k last week. Figured... right when I was looking to buy one. Fortunately, a guildy sold me his old one for 15k after winning a SotFW the other night. Oh, and I also noticed that about people auctioning to pay 400k for a BoC (with 10 other &gt;100k items listed in the same message).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">btw this was fixed i think 2 days after it was introduced. <br />
<br />
Ahhh now I understand (I had heard it was Erud's crossing...sounds like rumor was true).  But the problem is now the surplus of PP in the system.  SoE can't instantly fix this...its akin to counterfitters producing a massive supply of &quot;perfect&quot; money irl.  Also there is no FED to reduce the money supply from the purchase/sale of treasuries (my money &amp; banking course is coming back to me!).<br />
<br />
Not a good situation.  To get prices under control either SoE can witch hunt the people down (which may be impossible) and take the pp out; increase the supply of goods aka &quot;drop rate&quot; of items (reducing aggregate demand) or reduce the supply of pp via additional &quot;money sinks&quot; aimed at the high end hoard player to take pp out of circulation.<br />
<br />
All in all a very bad situation....I think this really sucks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Lomack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I read a thread on another message board about this.  Apparently most of those that took part in the bug were rolled back.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately when your running a vendor and you see people buying ornate and such at 80-100k left and right, any more pieces you get you bring the price up to match the demand.  Even if all the bugged cash gets removed from the system, it takes a while for the player vendors to realize that their stuff won't sell at the inflated price.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hmm.. you know... that sounds like a very good idea to me. I'd probably up that to 100k or so, but yeah. That would certainly take large chunks of platinum out of the market in a very short period of time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">yeah but from what i udnerstand plat is being sold ridiculously cheap now over the net. like 10 bucks for a 100k. will take a while before that all gets out the system.</div></div><hr />

you can also have 50k orbs for instant cast lev ( raid buff as well )<br />
instant click summon 20 food  30k<br />
instant click summon 20 drink 30k</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>zigak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">also the problem with rolling back the people who farmed 50 million plat is, what if they gave 40 mil to someone, then that someone gave 20 mil to someone etc and etc, it creates a spiderweb of plat trails that is impossible to eliminate, so most of the plat is still on the servers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Annaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I'm still wondering what's up with all the people buying almost solely warrior items.  Suddenly in the bazaar there are numerous people buying several high end warrior items.  These people are not just buying one item, they are buying multiple, and offering between 3 -4 times the already inflated prices.  The ornate molds for warriors are nonexistant in the bazaar (unlike the silk and leather pieces), and the sad thing is they are selling at completely ridiculous prices.  I understand what is going on with new pp being introduced to the servers...it will take quite a while to get that straightened out.  My question is Why does it seem to be only melee items that are suddenly in such demand?  Anyone have any ideas about this one?</div></div><hr />

Easy. Everyone wants to see what the new melee changes will be like =). Wait a month and there will be a flood of excess melee items in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />

<br />
and it would work too ... way back when i was huge into jewelcraft. i took about a two million plat out of the system buying velium and platinum bars to make jewelry. profit from items sold about 700k. amount lost to scams about 400k :(<br />
<br />
funny i never heard about that plat bug. if its been corrected then the prices will gradually go back down to where they were over the next several months. yes on veeshan i was amazed to see some items go up incredibly in price. since it takes time for everyone to become aware of this odd situation there are occasional great buy deals to be made in the bazaar if you intend to resell.<br />
<br />
but here is something that makes me wonder if the bug is really true or just a hoax. the prices of ldon items are still dropping like a rock and so are many items that drop from high level raid encounters. the highest level spells for example dont seem to be going up at all. but items that drop in mid to high level experience areas have in many cases gone through the roof. i attributed this to people no longer exping in their old zones because they want to do ldon instead. whereas high end guild raids are still popular.<br />
<br />
just speculation of course. id like to hear more about the plat loot bug thing and see if we can get a link to something better than anecdotal whether this really happened.<br />
<br />
it matters because if we knew that prices would drop in half again in a few months some of us would sell much of our better gear and buy it back later. whereas if the cause is due to the ldon phenomenon then we absolutely dont want to try this at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">The LDoN low price thing is due to Name stuff.<br />
Basically, noone recognizes it by name, so don't think about it when they go shopping.<br />
<br />
It's like when you go buy a pair of Jeans, Lewis will always sell better than some totally unknown brand, even if it's the same quality pants.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>sowy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">LDON items go down because:<br />
<br />
Everyones doing ldon<br />
They are lore<br />
The people getting them often refer to the items as crap (and to them it is) so set bad prices.<br />
They have too high a recommended level to be worth it to most twinks.<br />
<br />
<br />
Bugs hurt bad.  I'm experiencing both the good and the bad of the excess of pp out there.  Sold a lot of earth bows I made for 100k.  I'd love to see some sort of buy an AA thing but the next time a pp dupe bug comes out that will get exploited again with less trail to follow.<br />
<br />
The people who exploited the bug and sold the cash on playerauctions or wherever should just be sued outright.  I think it's possible you'll see a lawsuit of that type in the near future... Also think it'd be a good deterrent ASWELL as terminating the actual cheaters.<br />

<br />
But, to make a long story short ... there have been some bugs, macros and exploits being taken advantage of lately.<br />
<br />
And high ticket items have been targeted lately. By ebayers and dupers and macroers. Thus they're being taken out of circulation on a lot of servers.<br />
<br />
The economies are, supposedly, getting squeezed, as items at the top are disappearing or being sold for a lot more than usual. And items at the bottom are still, you know, bazaar junk (read Orc Fang Earrings).<br />
<br />
I'm very jaded on this topic however, and probably can not present a very valid viewpoint on the issue.<br />
<br />
I, for instance, do not believe the duping is solely to blame for this phenomenon.<br />
<br />
Take it with a grain of salt. As I said, I've been a ranting idiot on this topic.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Wow the rumors are running rampant. The banker in Befallen thing was just a rumor, the only way that could have happened is if someone at SOE did it.<br />
<br />
What was actually going on was a bunch of macroing a bugged price and trade skill combine. You could make bricks of ore and sell them back to a vendor for a huge profit (like 1500% profit). As a matter of fact, the pricing is still bugged. While it would take for ever to do this by hand, if you use a macro program you can crank out combines at a rate fast enough to be very lucrative.<br />
<br />
For those of you who are not familiar with macroing, you can get a program (MacroQuest) that directly sends commands to EQ just as if you are performing the actions yourself on the keyboard. You just program what you want your toon to do and let the program do it over and over again. Not only can you program it to walk around and buy supplies, you can also program it to do trade skill combines at a rate much faster than is humanly possible. Using the bugged prices and hundreds of combines per minute an undisturbed macro bot could crank out 100ks of plat per day. The people doing it where doing it across many (if not all) servers with many toons per server.<br />
<br />
They would then take all the plat they made and go buy all the high end tradeable gear in the bazaar. Literally. There where reports of people selling MILLIONS of plats worth of items in a single transaction. They also took a lot of the plat and put it up for sale at drastically reduced prices, 50% of the going plat market. In just a few days, many millions of plats where introduced in to the market causing outrageous inflation.<br />
<br />
Once the secret was out, plat prices were raised back to normal levels and now the people who macro'd all that plat are sitting on millions of plats worth of gear which they can sell at inflated prices since so much plat is floating around. They can then take they plat out of the market until pricing stablizes again and sell it for huge profits at playerauctions.com.<br />
<br />
I have to hand it to the guys behind the who scheme, it's pretty brilliant and will likely net them thousands of dollars for their trouble.</div></div><hr />

That is so very incredibly illegal that I doubt it could be true.  Basically you are saying that Sony is snooping on your computer without your permission for programs that have nothing to do with their product.  Its a violation of privacy and I really doubt they would risk violating who knows how many constitutional rights and federal laws to do this.  <br />
<br />
That would be like Microsoft installing spyware to look for pirated software when you upgrade windows.  The publicity hit alone that they would take if they got caught would make the benefit of doing this not even worth considering.  <br />
<br />
All Sony's patch program does is look for everquest files that might be needing to be updated or that are missing or corrupted and then it sends a request for a replacement to Sony and downloads it. It isn't looking for programs on your computer that violate the Eula.</div></div><hr />

The patch program may not be looking for illicit programs, but read the EULA, you have given them permission to scan the EQ directory on your PC. Any half intelligent hackers is not going to put illicit programs in their EQ directory though, so this point is moot. While the have the ability to scan your entire drive, it would be illegal to do so.<br />

How do you KNOW (other than SoE press statements) that this did not happen?Not only is this a matter that SOE has SPECIFICALLY address - for that matter, it is the ONLY scam rumor that they have specifically addressed, but the entire story is too fishy. The original person that reported this was an anonymous 65 bard that just &quot;happened&quot; to zone in to Befallen and just &quot;happened&quot; to be checking tracking. Anyone with half a brain would have put a mob like this somewhere that no one would find it. The fact that it showed up on bard track would mean it would have been near the zone in, in a zone that is near some very high traffic zones. Why not put the mob in a far corner of TD or OOT where there is very little traffic and the zone is so large that you could easily be outside of ranger tracking range? There are too man holes in the story for this to be possible. Other than the one anon bard, no one else on any server has seen the banker and no one got any screen shots of it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Ghuutred</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">In the name of profit, I would assume that many people are soaking up high end warrior garb in order to outfit a toon only to resell on EBay or elsewhere. I'm guessing casters can be sold on the strength of their spells mostly but warriors have to be outfitted to be attractive. Personally, I would think the sale of plat offline or accounts would be a violation of SOE's rights because people are making profit off of their product. <br />
   The flip side is I don't see how the plat introduced can be just yanked or rolled back because many innocent people have sold items for that plat and would face a total loss. Also, introducing items or AA for sale is likely to reward the transgressors more than the innocent players. As far as banning, I would have to assume anyone clever enough to come up with the schemes would also be smart enough to dump much of the profit off to other accounts or friends. If you have a million plat squirreled away somewhere then losing your account and starting another with that cash to outfit will not be too painful. In short, I think the problem cannot be fixed except over the course of months.</div></div><hr />
