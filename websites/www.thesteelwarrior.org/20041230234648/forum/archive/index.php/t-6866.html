<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Retnaburn</div><div class="date">04-26-2004, 05:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It means restarting from lvl 1, usually with the gear the first character had.<br />
<br />
Why do some people use so many ?????? btw?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aryl Paingiver</div><div class="date">04-26-2004, 05:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">would you also get to re-adjust your starting bonus points? and how would one reroll a toon?</div></div><hr />

<br />
you don't reroll anything, it is just the term for starting over, but more often used for when some restarts a char of the same class and gives the new char the gear from the old char. I am a reroll. I played a dark elf warrior to 52, the rerolled an iksar war and gave him all my gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zynth</div><div class="date">04-26-2004, 05:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the term comes from D&amp;D, where if your character died, you would litterally have to get out your dice and re-roll the stats for a new character.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lathen</div><div class="date">04-26-2004, 06:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah, dice. <br />
<br />
I miss dice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">doobs72</div><div class="date">04-26-2004, 11:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did your DM ever say &quot;Let me see your character sheet for a sec&quot; and you innocently hand it to him, and he rips it to shreds and sayd &quot;You're dead!!&quot;<br />
<br />
It never happened to me, but my friends told me stories about that.<br />
<br />
One of their DMs killed the players so often that he pre-rolled up a bunch of characters for them beforehand, so they wouldn't have to waste time in the middle of the session :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jarrae Halliwax</div><div class="date">04-27-2004, 01:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Saturday afternoons... public library... D&amp;D all day long.  I'd like to find that DM and get him in my guild.  Great fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rysingsun1</div><div class="date">04-27-2004, 02:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">rerolling is done for a number of stated reasons. one is because a person regrets what he put his starting stats in. he may want to change his deity. or he may want to play a different class. rerolling when you are only level 20 is one thing. rerolling at level 65 and 25 aa is quite another matter and i think most of us would agree that you better think long and hard before doing something so drastic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Saeborne</div><div class="date">04-30-2004, 12:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is D&amp;D still actively played?  Or have MMORPG's and games like Magic the Gathering largely superceded classic D&amp;D?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lathen</div><div class="date">04-30-2004, 01:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pen and paper D&amp;D is still played. I know a group that's been meeting weekly for 7+ years. <br />
<br />
About sadistic DM's --- mine used to get unwholesome glee out of watching us spend 2+ hours rolling and equipping, another 40 minutes travelling from some starting hellhole to get to the dungeon, then killing us in the first five minutes. He'd sit back from the table with a satisfied air and ask, &quot;So! How'd you like the dungeon?&quot;<br />
<br />
My wife and I say that to each other in /tell now whenever we buy the farm.</div></div><hr />

I still play fairly often, tho now it's as much of a kaffeeklatsch as a it is a game session, whereas in my youth it would have been 90% game and 10% chit-chat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tanise</div><div class="date">04-30-2004, 04:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you are a very casual player and level very slowly, then rerolling may be the answer. For most people it makes little sense. I put 5 (or 10 I forget) points into cha when I started because the &quot;official strategy guide&quot; published by verant said cha was a very important stat due to all the buying and selling I would do with vendors over my chars lifetime. I max out str and sta buffless and dex and agi with buffs.<br />
<br />
Aye it's an old school term from D&amp;D though I never had a char die. People Rerolled because they wanted better stats or to play a different class.</div></div><hr />

We all play EQ together too, but getting together in RL is always a blast.. usually hoarse for a couple days afterwards.<br />
<br />
And our DMs most dreaded phrase: &quot;Character Audit!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fulrik</div><div class="date">05-04-2004, 10:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I always loved bein a warrior. Sometime i Wondered what it would be like to be another class. Thats what alts are for lol. Nah I chose to put the 20 extra points into STRENGTH! Only to find out at lvl 30 or something that stamina is your best friend =\. I also chose god of Love...beautiful for a cold hearted killing machine eh? Nah that didn't stop me.
