<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>paladiin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Recently was able to pick up a Greatstaff of the Four Winds (41/31 with 75DD proc) for a good deal and I've been very very impressed with the damage it does.  However, I got it for my 61 monk and it was a perfect match.  <br />
<br />
But now I'm working almost exclusively with my warrior (now 61 as well).  My monk also wields WLK/Entwood so my DPS was still good and I passed the GSo4W to my warrior (play on FV with 2 accounts so it is tradeable).<br />
<br />
So here's my problem.  I'm sure I could augment the staff with a nice Anger aug or even Ykesha for now and I'd have one heck of an agro weapon.  But if I was in a group as a non-tanking DPS role (which I do occasionally) I'm going to give the tank fits for agro I'm thinking.  Also, since I can trade this to my monk, if I did so my poor monk would become an agro magnet.<br />
<br />
How should I augment this?  I'm leaning towards another DD and keep it a DPS weapon and using my CHoS/SotB/GSoT for agro.  Any suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Draxus Diablus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">What do you do the most of?  DPS or tanking?  The answer to that question will tell you what to aug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>paladiin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">About 50% tanking, 50% DPS (I'm #2 tank in my guild).  Hence the difficult decision.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Pag0</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I currently use a GSo4W, and I put a Permafrost Aug on it. 150dd, no stun. I decided to go with the lower agro proc since I also plan to have a better 2h weapon soon to put anger3 on soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm sure I could augment the staff with a nice Anger aug <br />
<br />
Although it would stil be dropable, wouldn't putting anger on it make it warrior only useable? Something to consider if you plan on moving it back and forth in the future. Also, I have seen many people use an un-augmented GSo4W and had zero problem with aggro. I guess I'd go for a DD/stun proc that can be used by all your melee.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Findra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Personally, I keep the GSo4W for pure DPS.  Put either the 150 DD or the 75 Lifetap on it.<br />
<br />
If you're looking for a cheap &amp; easy aggro weapon, pick up a Greatstaff of Thunder and slap an Anger or Ykesha aug on it (be warned:  rumors abound about impending nerfs to stun aggro).  I picked one up in the bazaar the other day for 25 plat.  It won't have the nice DPS that you've grown acustom to with the GSo4W, but when you're a tank you're looking for aggro, not DPS.<br />
<br />
Also, this will keep the GSo4W tradeable to your monk (as already mentioned).<br />
<br />
GSoT should be plenty aggro in most raid situations, especially aug'd with a stun or anger proc.  Even more so if you're not the first tank up at bat.</div></div><hr />

Then I would put angerIII on your best DPS weapon (GS4W).  I am a firm believer in DPS agro to smooth out mob agro between procs.  Pick up a WMBS for DPS &amp; sell the rest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Cuclain MacLlir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">My anger auged weapons don't list as warrior only, but then again, they're not tradeable on regular servers with the augment on them. Are augmented items tradeable on FV? What about the augments themselves or items bought with adv points?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Findra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">My anger auged weapons don't list as warrior only, but then again, they're not tradeable on regular servers with the augment on them.

1.  Although the weapons don't list as WAR only, with the WAR only aug attached other classes will not be able to equip such.<br />
<br />
2.  As of the recent &quot;big&quot; patch, all augments and augmented items are tradeable on FV (if they were tradeable to begin with).  Previously they were all NO DROP - which was in fact a bug within the FV ruleset.  On an interesting note, they were still able to be bought/sold in the bazaar.  /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Hyardgune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'd go with the 125 dd from Ruj, just on the theory that poison is less likely to be resisted than cold.<br />
<br />
Go4W can hold aggro in groups well, plus it is good dps and that is un-aug'd</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Grendonbb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have the 100dd stun (560 point cheapie) outta sro... it works like a dream.  And since it's by no means an agro weapon, even if stun agro gets nerfed it wont be a big deal.  It helps a lot with agro, making it easily good enough to perform in exp groups, but will not take agro from main tank in raids, and still helps the dps (unlike anger 3).  Sounds like this is right for you.</div></div><hr />
