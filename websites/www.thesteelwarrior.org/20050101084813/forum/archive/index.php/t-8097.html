<br />
Our platform group has put together a new version of Launchpad, just for EverQuest.  The new Launchpad system, which is used for all other SOE games, is now being applied to the Test server for you folks to try out.  Please log into test, using the Testeverquest.exe icon from your EQ directory and download the Launchpad front end.   Expect the login process to be a little slower the first couple of uses as it sets up its caches, but after it is all set, you should be logging in faster than ever.<br />
<br />
Make sure you submit your feedback using the bug command in-game or by using the feedback link, here on the Dev Corner.<br />
<br />
Thanks All!<br />

<br />
edit: you'll probably be able to use it to &quot;click to buy and play&quot; swg, eqII, lords of everquest!! etc.</div></div><hr />

LoL this wouldn't be surprising. it's exactly the kind of stuff that has high priority on SoE list and that must be bug free for sure. (who said it's impossible to get something that work properly in EQ ;) )<br />
<br />
have fun,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikken</div><div class="date">07-16-2004, 12:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The lauchpad is what is called the patcher in EQ. Its called the launchpad already on SWG and PS. I don't see what the big deal is really.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Then again, I seem to remember being able to login directly to a character from the launchpad. That maybe the big change, other than a code consolidation for SOE. Also they only download updates, after you've logged into the system, so you need an active account to download updates. This could make things like EQ emu a bit more difficult to keep up to date if I remember how it works correctly.<br />
<br />
Oh, I remember the scan being mucho faster on PS and SWG so maybe that'll be a plus too. So, I'll have to rethink my statement about seing what the big deal is.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikken</div><div class="date">07-19-2004, 05:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh, now if we could bypass the EULA everytime I start up EQ and be able to login dirrectly to one of my characters, that would be teh win. I don't want to see server selection unless I'm starting a new character. I don't want to see all my characters everytime I log in, I know they are there, I made them after all. It would be awesome to click on my EQ shortcut in my desktop, patcher runs through its little deal, choose a character (selection is persistant from the last character I logged into) from a drop down box or list, type in my password (option to save password), click the login button and be taken right into the gameworld.<br />
<br />
In other words, click the desktop icon, and click login after the patcher runs and I'm in the game playing already.<br />
<br />
Not, typing a password everytime, agreeing to the EULA everytime the client crashes, clicking past the lame SOE advertising (Why am I paying to see SOE advertising evertime I log in?), &lt;insert random survey&gt;, &lt;insert patch messages&gt; (Why isn't the the patch message loaded first thing so you can read it while waiting for the downloads?), &lt;insert stupid expansion buy buttons&gt;, select a server, select a character, and then finally getting in game.<br />
<br />
Click, click, play please!</div></div><hr />
