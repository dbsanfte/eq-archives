<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Greyslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">/comfort you two.  My largest debt is around 750 I think.</div></div><hr />

It's a pretty easy concept.  When you die rather than loosing experience you incur a debt.  At level 10 a single death incurs a debt of 200 points.  So using one death at level 10 as an example, this is what happens.  You start off with 200 debt points, each time you kill an NPC, who for our example will be worth 40 experience points, rather than the whole 40 going towards your leveling what happens is 20 experience points goes towards you leveling and 20 experience goes towards paying off your debt.  Which means that until you pay off your debt completely, you have to kill twice as many NPCs to gain the same amount of experience towards leveling as you would normallly.<br />
<br />
Or put another way, until your debt is paid off it takes twice as long to level.<br />
<br />
I think my highest amount of debt at any one time was 720 points or there abouts.  But I make it a point that when the going gets tough, the tough get going... :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kalorn Iceblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">At level 27 one death = 6750 xp debt :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>ThornyEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">At level 27 one death = 6750 xp debt :(<br />
At level 18 it was 950 exp per dirt nap; I've not died at level 19 yet.<br />
<br />
Oh...2571 was the worst I saw for myself. I remember the number vividly because I'd just finished bitching about having over 2300 debt... :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Was up over 2500 at 15th the first time we tried Positrons TF with a full group. Ouch. <br />
<br />
Should be 21 soon. Unless I get gunned down by 12 purple con mobsters near of my contacts...again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">4500 or so, the other day. I died twice. I didn't even notice it though as it disappeared really quickly (one group session doing indoor missions with a bunch of really good players).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Update...been playing with larger groups:18k is the new personal best. With a bit of unluck I will do all of 22 without ever having been out of debt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>irmingnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Ouch,  on my level 12 blaster I had more debt than exp needed to level =( oh well it took like 2 hour killing spree to pay it off and ding</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Had something like 4000 debt once, it tends to stay under 1k tho. Who says Scrappers die a lot?  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">if i had a dollar for every death i get with my mad scrapper skills...:D it's insane how much i die but; hey....when i'm alive i'm a freakin' blender.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Toga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Level 34  85,000 debt . Was hella fun tho , wouldn't take back a second of it. Was a really fun task force. Debt is easyto make up if you have someone higher level than you generate a mission and you and a few friends go and wipe it out. Can make about 125k xp / hour in a good level 39 mission.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Doggabone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">500 or so, but I've only got one toon into the low teens and the big debts are comin ... so far, I've almost always managed to avoid having more than one *death debt* at a time.  Altho I do often gather a new one moments after clearing off the old one *hehe*.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kalorn Iceblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">335k debt at 40 - well its what it showed as before I zoned out of the Hive once we killed Hamidon yesterday - course nice thing about being 40 till they release looking glass update is it resets to zero once you zone :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Aquias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">With my Controller i started the other day i managed to get to about 750 or so in debt by lvl 12.  Wonderful things those indoor missions</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kalorn Iceblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">At 44, 1 death = 54k, but its not too bad when red con minions are worth almost 1600 :)</div></div><hr />
