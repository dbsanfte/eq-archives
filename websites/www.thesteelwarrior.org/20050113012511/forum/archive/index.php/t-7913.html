Damn, must be on a channel I don't get, cuz Ron Jeremy is worth watching any time of the day as far as I'm concerned :)</div></div><hr />

Sci-Fi channel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">07-06-2004, 01:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm only interested in shit that doesn't go Paid Programming at 4am, and I think Sci Fi does.  Been awhile since I checked, but I'm pretty sure.<br />
<br />
I start work at midnite, on my days off, I sleep in.  I'm up at 2 or 3 AM, and by the time I realize that I have a TV, all the good programming is over.  I can catch a rerun of Forensic Files on Court TV (awesome shit, btw), and then I'm down to the only things that don't go Paid Programming until 7 or 8am when regular programming starts back up, and more realistically 9 or 10am until the good shit comes back on.  Helluva way to waste 50 bucks a month, on TV that I can't put to use.<br />
<br />
Why the fuck can't I pick a program I want to watch yet?  I sure pay enough for them to run a fucking cable into my house.</div></div><hr />

Um yaa.... sealab blew up again.... oh look its back! hehehe that is so funny (maybe i need to smoke something or lick a frog to see the humor)<br />
<br />
only 15 min long<br />
<br />
ATHF... not going to say anything, its just to far out there and its only 15 min long<br />
<br />
now the brak show... that i can understand :D (its 30 min long, it can hold a plot)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Suppose I could do that, but I'm trying to get away from the tapes these days, being in the DVD age and all.<br />
<br />
I've heard many things about this Tivo device, but have yet to see one (probably from a lack of looking).  Either way, I shouldn't have to guess when decent programming is going to be on to tape it...it should just be there I say!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">faederya</div><div class="date">07-06-2004, 03:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We have a cable recorder similar to Tivo except not called Tivo but called a digital video redorder (dvr).  Anyways, yeah you have to hit RECORD on the shows youll want to watch before your ready to watch them later, Haass... maybe you need a satelite and watch prime time TV on Australian time zone.<br />
<br />
/winks<br />
<br />
And  Inuyasha and Trigun are worth finding and pressing the record button on.  24 was another good show for the dvr.  Was nice to be able to watch 3 or 4 episodes at once in 2.5-3 hours without commercials.<br />
<br />
You can search by film names, film genre, etc so you can always pick a crap load of movies to record at the begining of the month and watch them at your leasure through out.<br />
<br />
Anyways ...<br />
<br />
Fae</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">07-06-2004, 03:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, up until last week, I had a dish.  Unfortunately when you don't own a house, and the view off your apartment deck is this : (In the attachment), you get shit for reception in the summer.<br />
<br />
Now, since I love where I live, and I'm not likely to be moving any time in the next couple of years, I'm stuck with teh shitty cable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thats the thing tho, after you record a few shows you like the tivo unite starts picking programs it thinks you will like based on your watching habits, it is really nice. (and it edits out comericals)<br />
<br />
I beleave there is a tivo, or tivo like system that works for cable to.<br />
<br />
As for shows, I am finding case closed fairly decent, kind of a impossible set up in the whole kid poison thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">07-06-2004, 04:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pretty nice view if you're not a satellite antenna though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am an exotic and complex being, with many unfathomable layers of wondrous majesty that no mere Tivo can ever hope to know sufficiently to predict what my magnificence might like viewing this evening.  Behold, I am perfection.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seriously, one very cool thing about tivo is something called a &quot;season pass&quot;- pick your video debauchery of choice and it'll record em for ya, for your late-night-nothing's-on enjoyment.  Just make sure your passes have higher priority than your significant other's and you're all set. ;)<br />
<br />
RdT.<br />
p.s. for mindless entertainment, I highly recommend &quot;Time Squad&quot;.... &quot;It's GO TIME!!!&quot;.  Classic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly, and that's why I won't be moving anytime soon just because I can't watch the TV I want to :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bourbon</div><div class="date">07-06-2004, 04:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Doesn't Tivo require a subscription of some sort as well?<br />
<br />
And my mood altering medications are none of your damn business.  It does what it's told, IT PUTS THE LOTION ON IT'S SKIN OR ELSE IT GETS THE HOSE AGAIN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kiya</div><div class="date">07-06-2004, 04:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got rid of my TV a couple years ago.  I honestly don't miss it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Remf da Troll</div><div class="date">07-06-2004, 05:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hola-<br />
<br />
Um, step AWAY from the cooking utensils... ;)<br />
<br />
Heh.  Yah, there is a subscription or a &quot;lifetime&quot; license required (btw, lifetime of the tivo box, not you- hopefully greatly different in duration).  Gets you program updates and infrequent software updates.  There's also Tivo units &quot;bundled&quot; with sat tuners if I remember correctly.<br />
<br />
RdT.<br />
p.s. other good latenight fare: stargate SG1 (campy at times but well done overall and 7+ years worth of episodes to catch up on), 7 days (campy all the time and not so well done, but still okay), a decade or two of the simpson's, and occasionally treats like James Bond marathons or godzilla week. ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">07-07-2004, 01:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tivo would be perfect for you, you don't have to set it up to record specific programs, you just tell it what shows you like, and it will record them when they come on, as well as other stuff that is similar.  Then you can watch it whenever you want, and fast forward the commercials.<br />
<br />
I think about getting one every once in a while, but I never, ever, just sit on the couch and watch TV, it's more like background noise to me so I'm not too picky about what I'm watching.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flair</div><div class="date">07-07-2004, 01:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">But you lose the whole late night ambiance of &quot;flip channel, doze, flip channel, dodge infomercial, check the spainish channel, flip etc&quot;.<br />
