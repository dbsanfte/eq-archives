<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fafrd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I blame 2 things for the current unbalance:<br />
<br />
1) Discipline defensive:<br />
- This discipline has now become our class defining skill. <br />
This gives us uber tanking ability during the 3 mins it lasts but when it fades we are just a knight with no side utility and average dps.<br />
How fool as it might seem, I hate this discipline. It seems that all other classes are balanced in comparison to a warrior that is using the discipline. Thus creating the unbalance. <br />
- How to fix this ? As things are now, a warrior would be balanced if he had discipline defensive always up, without the 50% damage malus. <br />
IE remove this disc from the game and put us on another mitigation table.<br />
<br />
2) Itemisation is completly fucked up:<br />
- Knights get closer to us as we get more loot because every high end WAR useable item is also knight useable.<br />
With no gear, paladins have about 81% of a warrior hp; With gear, it's about 90%.<br />
- How to fix this ? Well, there is no way to fix this without nerfing knights (sorry). Increasing warriors hp would trivialise current encounters (if disc defensive remains)<br />
<br />
<br />
My conclusion:<br />
I think solution 1 is the best to rebalance us. <br />
Knights would still keep the fastest aggro and also their side utility and current tanking abilityt but we would be the best damage sponges by a big enough gap to be still wanted in groups.</div></div><hr />
