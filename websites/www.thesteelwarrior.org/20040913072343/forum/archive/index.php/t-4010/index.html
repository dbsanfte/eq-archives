It's about me wondering if anyone was playing FFXI. I was stating that I am on the Ifrit server. Capiche?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grendonbb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">FFXI = Final Fantasy 11 for those of you that don't get it.  I know I didn't for a long time, till I sounded it out.  Reminds me of Land Before Time movies... the first one is good, and they just get weaker and weaker until oh boy, land before time XVI: Skyler's love affair...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Thorwick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I picked the game up and tried it and walked away impressed.  I created an Elvaan warrior and if I do put any time into it down the road I may pursue the Samurai job.<br />
<br />
However I still want to get my warrior alt to 65 first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kavak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I might try it. I did not want to play another MMORPG ever again after EQ but hey its FF and I am a FF nut hehe. <br />

Reports so far sound pretty good. I actually kind of like that people are not flocking to it enmass like I am sure WOW will get when its released. The language barrier will be a bit of a problem but I hear    <br />
the servers are filled with mostly very nice people. I also like the idea that high end raids are not 72man lag fests, I kind of like the smaller scope makes the actual person feel more important. They could change that though who knows.<br />
<br />
Seems like a nice little title, and from what I read well I am going to go a warrior definately at the start. Paladins I hear are the main tanks which sucks :), but I hear warriors higher up can do some impressive dps. Might do Samurai or Dragoon classes as well somewhere in there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gnomb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Got my Horizons beta access yesterday, so gonna try that first.<br />
Never like FF that much and reviews about it were not that great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>GSW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Being an FF nut, i got it on the first day. Woo! And once again, i'm going for Elvaan warrior. Samurai later. <br />
Playing on Bismarck server ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
That reminds me of the MUD days...before UO, before EQ. The (roughly) DIKU based world I played in was schemed such that warriors had the craziest DPS possible - via raw damage, 2 massive weapons, your +dmg from both hands applying to all attacks, and a crazy outlook on haste (doubles all attacks). No one else could compare, though second place was often debated.<br />
<br />
I don't mind tanking, it's a rush, but I liked the DPS world, with HP and AC, much better. I've been disappointed that EQ never really pursued that too much; at least, not beyond playing an offensive warrior (which is sad, if you don't have the defense).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">FFXI warriors are a LOT more focused on DPS. They have defensive abilities, including a &quot;Defender&quot; (/defensive lite) ability. But Paladins ARE the primero uno tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">But Paladins ARE the primero uno tank.At least Square is honest about that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">As forementioned, warriors CAN tank, but they're better set for DPS with 2 Handed Axes....<br />
<br />
<br />
Or you could just go Ninja sub-class and Dual Wield.</div></div><hr />

Ok I broke down and bought the game, I am also on Ifrit.  Finding me is easy, I'll be the one running around aimlessly cause I have no idea what the hell Im doing.  I did get level 7 last night :)  Im not quite sure I like the interface yet.  Visually its impressive though.<br />
<br />
Oh my FFXI name is Randalflag<br />
<br />
Maybe see you in game....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">What city, Terrorus?<br />
<br />
<br />
If you're near Bastok or Sandoria, I can help ya out :D</div></div><hr />

If anyone wants a WP (WorldPass) there, PM me and I'll hook you up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Konjunktion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Not to nitpick, but keep one thing in mind. Any tank who doesn't at least subjob warrior is worthless to a group.<br />
<br />
Only warriors get &quot;Provoke&quot;, and it is awesome.<br />
<br />
Paladin/Warrior = The tank. :)<br />
<br />
-Junk</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Zerapheus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Precisely, Konj.  I beta'ed FFXI (Cactaur Server, wuwu) and heard from a LOT of higher levels that the ultimate tank is a PAL/WAR, followed closely by SAM/WAR and WAR/MNK.  Hell, even NIN/WAR makes good tanks from what i've heard about one of the ninja's end job abilities.<br />
<br />
WAR is a required job though for any who want to be a real tank due to &quot;Provoke&quot;, a level 5 job ability that is an effective taunt that recycles every 30 seconds.  Any other class that thinks they can taunt without a WAR sub are wrong.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You were informed wrong. The best tank IS PAL/WAR, but SAM/WAR isn't because of the armor. WAR/PAL/DRK all wear what we'd call &quot;Plate&quot; Dark Knights are NOT tanks, but instead DPS. You only want the DRK tanking when almost all your group is dead. <br />
<br />
Warrior/Monk might be decent, but you'd have two conflicting skills...(Warrior's proficiency in Great Axes (2H Axes), and Hand-To-Hand combat)...You'd get Chakra though, but it probably wouldn't be too much aggro.<br />
<br />
1 thing really bothers me though....WHY NIN/WAR? Ninjas wear like monk armor.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Varaho</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Question: do they have the skills jump and swordtech, and if so who has them?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">No sorcerers in FFXI Varaho :( <br />
<br />
Anyway, Dragoons have Jump (I will be a Dragoon/Samurai later in the game.), plus they get a Wyvern to fight with them too :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Wychway</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">BTW, Dragoons not only get jump, but a pet wyvern. :D<br />
<br />
I'm going Summoner evenually, myself. Which is from everything I've read one of the most pita classes to play. But I don't care!</div></div><hr />

Ya Im in Bastok.  I think I redinged lvl 10 like 10 times last night. woohoo...<br />
<br />
:)<br />
<br />
Acutally what I need help is with is the interface.  have you made any good macros other than a /assist key?  Manual isnt too helpful.</div></div><hr />
