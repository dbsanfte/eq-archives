<br />
It seems Windblade, but if I'm wrong please tell me! :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shorties</div><div class="date">06-06-2003, 12:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I have ToD, but I'd only want to use that to start a fight.  After that I'd want something with more DPS, so would it be GSoT or Windblade for soloing?<br />
<br />
eeeep.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">06-06-2003, 12:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you are going to shell out the plats for a weapon, then just get the GSoT. Windblade puts out more DSP, but not by much. But, with the GSoT you have a great agro weapon as well as great DSP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">06-06-2003, 02:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Black Acrylia Halberd is a fine soloing weapon.<br />
<br />
ToD till proc, swap in the hard hitting Lifetapping weapon. <br />
<br />
Greatstaff of Thunder would probably be better than Windblade for soloing, just on the proc.<br />
<br />
But Black Acrylia Halberd is quite an effective soloing weapon.<br />
<br />
And besides, by the time Windblade OR the Great Staff fully realize their stats and potential, your soloing days are pretty bleak.<br />

<br />
:eek: <br />
<br />
When does that weapon prob? (the black acrylia)?  Someone told me 50 once when I compared them to using two blood points which I think proc at 45.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hyardgune</div><div class="date">06-06-2003, 10:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For soloing... Windblade.  In general GoT.  Superchum is right though, GoT's required level of 55 means that you aren't doing much soloing by the time you can use it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Braeorn</div><div class="date">06-06-2003, 10:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd use the ToD and swap in Windblade strictly because you are soloing...the proc which is effectively meant for aggro and interupts becomes less important, since its unpredicatable.<br />
<br />
In solo, after slowed I'd just do as much dps as I could.<br />

It doesn't happen often enough to stop casting, and 0 second stun doesn't do anything at all against melee.<br />
<br />
At 60, the damage bonus makes the two pretty even.  I might like the faster swing of GoT over the possibly 1-2% extra damage though.<br />
<br />
Fighting things unbuffed.  I usually can only afford to use a truncheon for maybe 20%, otherwise I'll end up blowing a disc and still dying or running.  Would be different if you can find some wimpier things to fight:).</div></div><hr />
