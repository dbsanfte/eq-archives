<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>CarpeDiem42</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Right now, I'm using a CHoS and SotB for just about everything. My guild has been very Elemental focused so we've even lost track of the AoW spawn rate as well as Cursed/Creator. What I was wondering is, is there anything out there droppable or farmable that would be a good in-the-meantime upgrade from CHoS/SotB until I get a BoC/BF/HG? I haven't bothered with my epics although I could probably get them within a week if i wanted to. Ratios just seem to be too damn crappy.</div></div><hr />

Your setup for weapons is fine. I've personally turned down guild-property BoC's because of my prior weapon setup ( SotB and GBoS ) and got the ornate(s) pieces as DKP allowed.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lilwee Beasty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Great Blade of Storms would be a nice, relatively easy to farm piece for you. Drops off the BoT tower named Einride Icestorm...14/18 ratio, 85 hp, 175 dd/stun proc. <br />
<br />
Einride also drops the Ornate plate BP mold, so he's an extra good target for farming imo. Easily killable with 2ish groups, maybe 1 group if they are mostly elemental gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've had good results with a Rotting Fist from Bertox with Anger 3 on it.  It's a noticeable step up from an augmented Great Blade of Storms for aggro as well as DPS, and also beats an unaugmented BOC (to my surprise).  I got this weapon because I was in a similar situation as you.  I got tired of waiting for an aggro weapon from targets that my guild never hit, and took the next weapon I could that had more than 100 hp and a high ratio and a proc.  If you are willing to burn an Anger 3 augment on it, then you might want to do similar.  I don't pretend that it's the absolute perfect aggro setup, but it won't let your guild down.  A Gold Runed Mithril Knife with Anger 3 would be pretty sweet.</div></div><hr />
