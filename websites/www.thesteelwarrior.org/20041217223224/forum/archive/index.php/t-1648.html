We are having trouble on the Mobs that spilt  any advise on how to keep them under control both times we had just 2 chanters so keep that in mind.. Im just wandering is there something that we are missing or not thinking about correctly.. We wen to kill the BIG gator in POE last nite and we had problems at the temple with the ones that split as soon as they died most of the time they would gang up on me or the SA any tips would be nice..</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for the splitters, i assume you are referring to the Armadillo's?  The splits that come off of them are green, they really shouldnt give you any trouble.  We usually just have our monks and rangers solo them while the majority of people stay on the mob the warriors called assist on.<br />

Hope that helps....</div></div><hr />

What this post actually showed was the decline of Everquest. In your little retarded opener, you demonstrated for us all just how far this game has sunk. That you could actually gain access to elemental planes and then pose an almost impossibly stupid question with a straight face - it's disheartening to say the least. In previous years I could rest easy knowing people like you were occupied exping in LoIo, Dreadlands, and Velketors OR pulling off trade window scams to the 'special children' of the EQ world (i.e. your relatives).<br />
<br />
Blind chimpanzees slamming their keyboards with their own testicles could probably figure out how to deal with 'spiltters' before your brain could concoct a plan. That's my final answer.<br />
<br />
This section of the Steel Warrior needs to go back to private. At least then, mind numbing shit like this would be kept out....</div></div><hr />

It wasn't given enough time to settle. The board had just transferred from EZCrap and whatnot. Within a month it would have had decent traffic from the high end warriors of the EQ Community.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Furor isn't better than you Slammer.  We are all created equal.  However, Furor is probably one of the most skilled, most diligent, most knowledgeable warriors in the game.  If you want to choose somebody to mess with, mess with somebody much easier... like any other warrior practically.</div></div><hr />

THERE has got to be people that are reading this and can SEE my point of view.. If there is post it ..</div></div><hr />

1.  Is English your first language?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hulanta</div><div class="date">07-01-2003, 05:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is very hard to read.  With the spelling and grammatical errors, it is easy for people to dismiss your posts quickly than if you work to make your posts more eloquent and correct.</div></div><hr />

He asked about &quot;A dusty warder&quot; I bet.<br />
<br />
Thats one of the tougher ring events in the zone and you need a huge CC crew and a decent tank mez crew I guess, my guild havent had the best luck with it so far.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Furor having &quot;knows warriors are superior&quot; under his name just seems odd to me.<br />
<br />
On-topic.<br />
<br />
I'm glad you got someone to understand the question you were asking. I always look at asking for advice like this:<br />
<br />
If your going to ask someone to go out of their way to help you, you should atleast go out of your way to make the request readable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crystara</div><div class="date">07-01-2003, 07:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mud ring splits as well, but soil is the most difficult of the 4 in my opinion, we cleared all but soil first try, but that one took a bit of learning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ceny</div><div class="date">07-01-2003, 11:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its not that you asked how to handle a mob that bugs people, it's how you worded it.  The way you posed this question and your question about Bertoxx, you were very vague and it seemed that you were looking for a detailed step by step spoiler on the  encounter before you made any serious attempts to beat it or figure it out.  Describing your problem specifically, including how the mob acted and how you or your raid party reacted, and the result on the mob...and then asking for feedback/suggestions would net you an answer that might be more to your liking.<br />

<br />
2 things:<br />
<br />
1) The person was quoting a MOVIE. Perhaps you've seen it, perhaps not. It's Pulp Fiction. Funny film. Pretty abrasive language, but after reading the above quote, I'm sure you'll be fine watching it and not offended by anything there.<br />
<br />
2) Cleaning up your grammar would help cut down on some of the flames you're receiving. Sometimes it's very hard to understand what it is you're trying to convey. (Oh and it's DAMN, not DAME ...  that one was really starting to get odd to read).<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
Think of it THIS way ...<br />
<br />
Damn the man<br />
<br />
Dame Edna IS a man<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slammer</div><div class="date">07-07-2003, 01:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well i have learned many things about posting on this board.<br />
1.  Be detailed about what i am trying to say.<br />
2. I am really better off just finding out things on my own.<br />
3. Just learn to ignore people that try to bash you and think you <br />
    are stupid.<br />
4. This is grammar shcool..<br />
 So now lets close this post and let this post fade away. I have done some checking and i now know who Furor is. This still did not give him a reason to say what he did. I know that im not the brightest person in the world nor do i claim to be. From now on i think ill just read here instead of posting my questions.<br />
<br />
On a ending note its just a game...</div></div><hr />
