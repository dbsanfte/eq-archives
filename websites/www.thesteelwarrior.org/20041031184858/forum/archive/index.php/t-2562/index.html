<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zinj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm looking for a bit of advice on what to upgrade first. Fierce Heraldic is gonna be my armor of choice and since I can't get everything I want at once, I plan on doing two or three pieces to start. The most obvious ones will be Bp and legs...but what should be my third item and so on. I'm not in a major raiding guild, pretty much all old world but I am looking into planar xping after my upgrades. Any advice or even alternative upgrade suggestions will be greatly appreciated.  Thanks all. (c=<br />

edit: Forgot to mention it first time around but my budget is limited to a few K..I just happen to be striking a deal with a smith to make the armor for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gunrack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Get the Bracers First IMO most bang for the buck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">and then the legs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Roughbeard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Dont get the Gaunts btw, not worth it, Myrm Gaunts you can buy for 1k and they have more hp/ac. Bracers are great for the AC, Svs, stats, AND 55 hps.. then ya wanna go Bp/Legs, then id say Arms/Boots/Shoulders. Just go for most Hp/ac that it would upgrade for that slot, like if you have a really weak boot slot but your arms are ok, just go for the boots.. which would be common sense anyways ;) Good Luck with the FH and be glad you picked RZ :p<br />
<br />
Rough</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zinj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for the advice.  I have finalized a deal with a smith. If I provide an excess of materials for each item and a small commission, he will make them for me.. Now my big problem is blue diamonds.  )c=   To make all the pieces I want including failures on smithing I am looking at 65 BDs total (we agree on 6 pieces: bracer 2X, legs, cloak, shoulders, and Bp). I can farm everything else given time of course.  So close yet so far.  :(<br />
<br />
edit: After checking prices on TM I should be able to buy all the blue diamonds for 16 20K max. But after looking into the recipies more I see the Essence of Sunlight(s) I need will be my choke point..Sigh only need 60 of those though. Not like the 325 Celestial Essences</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kiya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">For essences of sunlight, you can kill sand giants in oasis/south ro or chromodracs skyfire.  Bring a healer partner if needed.  (You will for the chromos, not sure about the giants.)<br />
 <br />
As for upgrading, junk the black pearl ring and neck and forest loops ASAP.  <br />
Ears: electrum black sapphire earring (2ac, 35hp) or Jagged bone hoop (6ac, 40hp, 5sv fire/disease)<br />
Fingers: plat fire opal (5ac, 55hp) or velium fire opal (6ac, 65hp) are pretty hard to beat til you can afford valorium rings.<br />
Neck:  Clattering bone necklace (6ac, 6str/sta, 30hp) or an advanced cultural neck (usually 14ac, 5agi and 25 or more hp) are good choices.<br />
<br />
Those items should not be too hard to find in your bazaar. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fenring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The bracers are nice and the mask too.<br />
<br />
As was said you can farm the essence of sunlight in skyfire ( help a cleric farm their epic shards and you'll get a few ).<br />
<br />
Farm BD's in Dulak or Nadox, there are a few good places to get them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zinj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thanks for the advice. The smith I made a deal with had mentioned helping clerics in SF was the best way he got the essences. I may just take my guild there, everyone is low enough we can still get xp and spell drops for the casters..it's gonna take a while to get all I need though.  )c=<br />
<br />
As for my other gear I been meaning to swap em out, those were freebies from my alt and some junk stuff to bump up my dex/agi through early levels. They are next to the chopping block after my cultural is done with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Neksnappa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I wouldn't waste plat on FH bracers/shoulders, just attend a few vindi raids, get ally SS faction, and have a few friends help with Draconic Pauldrons and Bracers of Benevolence. The bracers in particular are as good as the FH bracers, and won't cost you a penny.<br />
<br />
Instead of those pieces of FH, I'd say get the boots. 30ac, 5dex/sta, 60hp is nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Zinj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thanks for the advice Nek.  (c=<br />
<br />
Anyone else have any suggestions on what items that are better than cultural and can be obtained by a single group in the 50 60 range?<br />
<br />
Any help, worldly wisdom, etc etc you can pass down to us youngins is well appreciated. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Weldilar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">i would suggest trying to put together open kael raids to farm armor..or go get moktor stuff in up(1 grpable) or just get individuale(sp) pieces of wahtever in bazaar. i did that and its worked so far and im 55:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gunrack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Bracers of Benevolence are indeed nice specially cause of their high MR but faction work for me &quot;casual player&quot; is too much of a pain being rallos zek worshiper so went with FH bracers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Zinj?<br />
<br />
That really you?<br />
<br />
The fat monk?<br />
<br />
If so, when'd you start a warrior?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Zinj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Fat monk...? Was there ever such a thing?<br />
<br />
Doubt I'm who you think I might be. I'm fat so that's halfway there at least...Other than that I'm just a big dumb tank all the way. I'm not suprising that someone out there has the same name as I..least he's not on my server that I know of  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Cenyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Zinj was a big poster on Monkly-Business forums, who has disappered =(<br />
<br />
<br />
Thought you were the same person myself until that post!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Yeah, Zinj was a big poster there and on a couple of other sites. His sig was Zinj, The Fat Monk, so that's where that came from.<br />
<br />
He helped me a lot waaaaaaaaay back when, when I was just a newbie monk learning how to play Everquest.<br />
<br />
So I thought, OMG, he's now a warrior?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Zinj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">No monkies for me. One way or another I ended up with the same first name as he. It's also possible he's my evil twin brother..or am I the evil one? ;)</div></div><hr />
