<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>FrenzyBarbarian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I need some weapon help. Right now I am using my warrior epic but the same time my guild is handing out BoC to the 65 warriors in our guild. I would definetly use the BoC in main but what about off hand? was thinking maybe the red epic or a Cord Hilted Spike driver but dont know....<br />
<br />
thanks for your help</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If your guild is capable of getting BOCs, then you could feasibly be killing Ssra named or BoT tower named. I would try to get:<br />
<br />
1. Bloodfrenzy<br />
2. Hategiver<br />
3. Greatblade of Storms<br />
4. Cord Hilted Spike Driver<br />
5. Copper Hammer of Striking<br />
6. Sword of the Bloodsworn</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>FrenzyBarbarian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">how about Sceptre of Destruction? or I was thinking about using BoC and red epic in offhand until I maybe get bloodfrenzy...<br />
<br />
I heard too many complains about SoD though so may not head in that direction...<br />
<br />
<br />
anymore ideas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>devlok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">What complaints are you hearing about SoD? I love it, thing procs like mad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>FrenzyBarbarian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">my friend used to own two of these bad boys and said he would steal aggro from MA during raids... would get a couple of resists and wammo he died...<br />
<br />
but I think its a bad ass weapon<br />
<br />
288dd (more with ingenuity III)<br />
knockback<br />
stun (short)<br />
<br />
but then again do I want to Enraging Blow weapons or one EB and one DD weapon?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Do SoDs still drop on your server? If they do, then sure its a viable option for an agro weapon if you can loot one. If you are going to have to spend plats to get one, I don't think its worth the ridiculous price when you can get a weapon that is 95% as good in a couple of hours of exp or if you are really lazy you can buy one for under 20k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">my friend used to own two of these bad boys and said he would steal aggro from MA during raids... would get a couple of resists and wammo he died... <br />
<br />
Err, that's not a complaint.  That means it's a great weapon, your friend is just an idiot for using them when he's not tanking.<br />
<br />
The SoD is an insane weapon, but definitely not worth the price tag these days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>FrenzyBarbarian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I still think SoD kicks ass , along with BoC I shouldnt have any troubles. But hey , if im going to spend 200k on one its worth it.<br />
<br />
but as I stated before should I get two Enraging Blow weapons or one Enraging Blow weapon and a DD weapon like OSoW ect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Vigdis SangCaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Enraging Blow Weapons.<br />
<br />
LDON provides the opportunity to buy DD procs so especially now I'd focus on EB weapons.  So far we dont see any +hate procs coming close to EB, but there are DD's out there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Toham</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I use a GBoS and on accident sometimes Im not paying attention I steal aggro from pallys. Hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>radalas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Cry.... I thought we were supposed to steal agro from palis?<br />
<br />
:o</div></div><hr />

I still think SoD kicks ass , along with BoC I shouldnt have any troubles. But hey , if im going to spend 200k on one its worth it. The point is that for 200k+ that it will cost you to get an SoD, you could get a Copper Hammer and quite a few upgrades that would give you FAR more benefit than the slight difference between a CHoS vs. SoD.<br />
<br />
On my server, there is an SoD for sale for 225k. For that money you could buy:<br />
<br />
1. Copper Hammer - 10k<br />
2. Helm of RZ - 80k<br />
3. Featherwood bow - 60k<br />
4. LDoN Warlord gaunts - 60k (I forget the name, 90hp 34ac and stats)<br />
5. Mosquito leg earring - 15k<br />
<br />
So which would you get more use out of? That's why for MOST people buying an SoD is a waste of plats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">there's always the SoD v2.0; Blashpemous Blade of the Exiled.<br />
slap something on that thing :D<br />
<br />
definately if you can smack around AoW that thing isn't out of reach for ya's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sturgis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I just got a sword of the bloodsworn, and I'm not that impressed with it's proc rate. :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mainhand the sword of the bloodsworn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">yeah, mainhand that puppy sturgis; i bet that thing will r0x yer s0x :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>FrenzyBarbarian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Would Cord Hilted Spike Driver still be useful with BoC?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Sturgis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I guess I could try that, even though it's faster than my mainhand...not by much. 12/19 vs 12/20</div></div><hr />
