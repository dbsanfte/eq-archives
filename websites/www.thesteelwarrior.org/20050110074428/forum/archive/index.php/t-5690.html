I know they're brand new, but I also imagine some of you have explored fairly thoroughly by now. <br />
<br />
I've spent a couple of hours over a couple of evening lfg in Natimbi with no luck so far, so I haven't had any opportunity to try anything out. <br />
<br />
Is ALL the content geared toward elemental level people?  I am way, way south of elemental (see magelo) and I'm just wondering if there is anything at all for players of my, uhhh, caliber.   Oh, and I'm only level 62. <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

I see it as more of a raiding expansion than grouping expansion. The XP absolutely sucks compared to PoP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With the challenge involved, it doesn't matter. I'd take a sewers mission over a pofire group any day of the week, even though pofire is 2-3x better xp - GoD groups are fun again. Tough, but that's the point.<br />
<br />
Xenephex - If you can bring your own group, you could probably take the Qinimi zone in. Mobs are on par with Plane of Valor, but their chain aggro range is retardedly huge.</div></div><hr />

Of course they're also twice as hard but that's the price to pay for not needing 20 flags.<br />
<br />
On the upside even on the first sewers stage you can get 100 HP/mana/Endurance items from named.  There are some really sweet items for the average joe to get if you can just somehow survive long enough (not easily done, mind you).<br />
<br />
Qimini mobs's damage is deceptively low.  You have to factor in the damage that Chaos Claw, which almost everything procs, does.  It is basically unresistable for anyone lower than EP level (Chromatic -150) and it is a large chunk of extra damage.  Yes that mob only hits for 400 but he can proc a Chaos Claw for 450 that the average joe won't have a chance to resist.</div></div><hr />

Chaos Claw (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4570&amp;source=Live) is chromatic... so it applies it's -150 adjust mod to whichever your current lowest resist is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
While I did, for a while, think that Chromatic might be checked against the lowest resist you currently had, some things just didn't gel.<br />
<br />
My lowest resist atm is Poison at 101, but there have been instances where I have resisted Chaos Claws. Not often, mind you, but if there was a -150 check against my lowest, ie. Poison, then I shouldn't have been able to resist it at all.</div></div><hr />

The drops are real nice, some stuff is over 100 hp and mana.  There are some named deeper in that are yellow con (to 65), drop augments that are lore +25 hp +25 mana + 25 endurance.  You will want a good group though, stuff hits 1000 and procs 650 or so really fast.  A step up from LDoN hard dificulty but if you are not as well equiped, you can bring more than one group and make a mini raid of it.</div></div><hr />

The named have a repop timer -- think BoT.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can resist Chaos Claws at less than 150 min resist because some of the stuff in Gates are surprisingly low level.  There are stuff you can kill with Coup de Grace 3 that will proc Chaos Claws which puts them at below 59 for sure.  Remember that level does play an effect into whether you can resist something or not.</div></div><hr />

He spawns over by the turtle pond and wood bridges. Make sure to bring a healer with ya, preferably one who can radiant cure. I got the sword last night, gonna try it out some today and see how the aggro is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">02-16-2004, 03:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cleared out like 3 corners in Ferubi today with a group, if any item dropped it sure wasn't mentioned.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah the yellow named are triggered, because I saw 2 Pixxt Elite Hammermaster there today.  That'd not be possible if those are merely on a timer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shadowfrost</div><div class="date">02-16-2004, 06:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, the Ferubi drops are sort of rare, but they do exist.<br />
<br />
From memory, there are 125 hp/100 mana/100 end shoulders (all melee classes, no drop) and a 100hp/125mana Mana Pres IV range slot (all caster classes, no drop).  You can get both off random yard trash near any of the zones in; I've personally seen the range slot item drop, but it was one item in a four hour chain-pulling session (it came off a Noc Darklurch).  The shoulders I heard about from a friend and they're also listed on Allakhazam.<br />
<br />
I don't know if there is anything else like that in the zone.<br />
<br />
I'm guessing that this is a return to the Kunark idea where you could get a RBG off many different kinds of critter in Sebilis - but you'd be camping for ages before you saw one drop.</div></div><hr />

And if you can't handle the mobs you'll spend most of your time dead anyway so you wouldn't see much in ways of items.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">02-16-2004, 01:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I found the same thing, 2-4%aa per mob. Not bad, but the pay off is in how fast they die. Mobs seem to have pretty low HP, we where able to blast through them pretty quickly. Kill rate was faster than LDoN hard with better per mob exp. The yellow named don't seem to be triggered, we had on pop in a room no where near us, 1 up when we got there, and one popped on us mid fight. All of the yellow named seem to have PHs and spawn in the same areas. Running thhe &quot;loop&quot; should produce more drops than camping a zone. This dungeon was meant to be crawled.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">02-16-2004, 04:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well we had 2 Elite Hammermaster up so unless there's two PHers in that room, I'd think it's triggered.  Anyway the easiest way to find them is just kill everything in and out of their rooms.  <br />
<br />
I don't find the mobs to be that low in HP.  Mastruqs are especially annoying for a melee-heavy group because casters always figure melee will finish of a running snared mob...</div></div><hr />

However pool of sludge is very easy mobs compared to the other 3 trials and stuff drops out of very easy trash mob. When i did it we got a 80/80/80 i think it was haste belt (36%) and a ER 4 cloak that was arround 100/100/100. Theese dropped of pure trash that hit for like 100. <br />
<br />
In the third trial (the lair) stuff dropped off of some named spawns in the zone. I was so lucky to get 2 of the drops. new arms slightly better than ornate and a 90 hp mask when doing that one. <br />
<br />
second trial we saw no drops<br />
<br />
first trial suposedly the end mob drops a spell.</div></div><hr />

didnt get any loot off boss, but 2 loot droping named was in the dungeon too, one dropped a BST rune along with some caster shoes.</div></div><hr />

They pay for this game too and they didn't get a lot out of the last 2 expansions, it's their turn to get some new content. GoD is worth it just for the AA and leadership and there are a few places non-time peple can hunt, you just have to use your head and not be afraid to die a few times until you figure it out.</div></div><hr />

Its basically about 30 - 45 minutes, and they seem to spawn when you get near them. Don't ask me, watch for yourself. It happens.<br />
<br />
I reccomend if your not an EP guild, bring about 3 - 4 groups to do these nameds. You can get a large number quickly when you get to the central fountain room. Last night we got 11 nameds on the way to do Smith Rondo.. 5 15 AC augs, 3 25/25/25 augs, an earring, a bard lute, and a caster primary item.</div></div><hr />

The aggro radius was small and the only time we got adds is when I ran into a wanderer that had just popped.  Exp was about on par with POV.  It was just an alternative and something new.  We did move into one of the deeper zones but it was getting tiring having pacify with the ench and then pull with my warrior for all the mobs.</div></div><hr />

I agree, even though I'm not one of them.  It is neat to see some of the more advanced players on this forum excited about the new content;  and encouraging to know that SOE was able to design something that is challenging for them. <br />
<br />
As for me (the original poster), I suspect I will not be spending much time hunting in the new zones at the moment.  I'm an adequate tank in PoV, but have never tanked in BoT (I get tells from people in BoT asking for my AC and HP and then don't hear back from them after I respond), so I think I would be close to useless in GoD zones from what I am seeing here. <br />
<br />
The tribute system will be worth the price of admission for me, if they do not nerf the heck out of the points I've already gotten.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">slyse</div><div class="date">02-17-2004, 02:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">(I get tells from people in BoT asking for my AC and HP and then don't hear back from them after I respond)<br />
<br />
I got those every now and then also, being a wood elf.  My standard response was always, &quot;enough&quot;.  I knew that I could tank, and if they didn't trust me, then they could keep looking.  Judging by your magelo, you're doing fine for your level...just keep grinding it out in valor and you shouldn't have a problem in BoT or early GoD.</div></div><hr />

That's a pretty narrow minded view. While it is 100% true that many tanks are going to have a very hard time tanking Ferubi and above, there is nothing that says that you can't use these are raid zones if you can't single group the content. Take 2 or 3 or 6 groups in to get some very high quality loot. Where else is a mid-level guild going to get 15ac aug, 25/25/25augs, and 100/100/100 items? Just because you can't single group these mobs doesn't mean there is no content for pre-EP people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bashiae</div><div class="date">02-17-2004, 07:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have to say I agree with Wandor 100%.  The release of GoD, and to a lesser extent LDoN, was actually a Godsend for a large number of 'lesser' to 'above average' ranged Guilds.  The first big thing is instancing, allowing a lot of access to content without contention between other forces (Guilds).  The second big thing, is the sheer exponential increase in loot upgrades that are being introduced even off the &quot;zone-in,&quot; for lack of a better term, mobs in GoD.  I mean really, 100/100(/100) loot was really top of the line even throughout Velious and much of Luclin, and now it can be obtained with a few groups.<br />
<br />
In some ways, it really makes me wish I still had my old guild under me - a great group of skilled players, but never the powerhouse guild on the cutting edge.  GoD would've just been sheer excitement, fun, and massive upgrades all around, given people are willing to try some new things out.<br />

Lesser 'casual' guild farms Elite Pixxt ____Masters with 4 groups.  It's still the same amount of loot roughly (since your 4 groups probably kill faster than 1 group of Time people).  I don't see a problem here.  Casual peopel can't do it with one group but you can always bring more.  It's still loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flair</div><div class="date">02-18-2004, 01:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My personal observation is that GoD has lots for both casual and hard core folks.  The first 3 zones have stuff to offer to the former while the deeper flagged zones have stuff for the later.<br />
<br />
This whole &quot;casual/hard core&quot; thing just isn't borne out by reality...try GoD you'll see for yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kamidari</div><div class="date">02-18-2004, 03:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm definitely far from uber...  NToV and ornate stuff, and with relatively little effort, I've gained nearly 200hp (4AA for 100hp, and 4 +20 augs from easy-cheesy mobs in Natimbi) since Gates came out.  That alone makes me happy, and I haven't really had a chance to explore it much deeper.  <br />
<br />
We tried an instanced zone the other day, but apparently did the hardest one where mobs were hitting for 1200-ish.  We made it in a ways, but one little mishap and we were dead.  Very borderline on being doable for my normal group.  We're going to try one of the easier ones tonight, for a less stressful evening, but will definitely be going back for a retry on the hard one sometime soon. :)<br />
<br />
I'm sure my guild will be trying Ferubi as a raid target sometime soon, too.  Obviously the major named are out for us, but the lesser ones have some nice stuff, and will hopefully be doable for us.<br />
<br />
Yes, GoD is very challening for sub-elemental people, but hey, challenging is more fun imho.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I guess I'll find out tonight, but from what I've read, if you get them from Gamesh and not the High Priest, they're for loot/exp and not flagging, and then only the Processing Plant has the 1200 hitters, with the others being easier.  Hopefully that pans out. ;)<br />
<br />
Edit: Yeah, there do seem to be easier ones...  We did Crematory tonight and the mobs at entry hit for about 500, gradually making it up to about 950 a few rooms in.  Not a cakewalk by any means, but quite a bit better than 1200.</div></div><hr />
