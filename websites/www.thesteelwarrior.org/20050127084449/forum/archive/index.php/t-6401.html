<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ohbb</div><div class="date">03-29-2004, 01:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just started back playing EQ so have missed out on alot. There seem to be a lot of new Agro weapons out there so I came here to check out the Agro chart for updates. Post is locked with nothing after july of 2003.<br />
Just wandering if there is a new post on agro weapons somewhere that I'm just not able to find.<br />
<br />
I was also wondering (if there is a new post out there) if the weapons might get some sort of rating? The old post had weapons listed in order of best agro producer on down for that type of weapon but didn't say how the weapon compared to weapons of a different type. <br />
EX: Sword of the Bloodsworn is listed above the Frostbringer but how does it compare to the Copper Hammer of Striking?<br />
Also listing what lvl ther weapons start to proc would be nice.(dont rem if old list shows that info or not)<br />
<br />
<br />
****************************<br />
Here is the question I'm looking to have answered at this time.:<br />
I just started back playing EQ and see alot of new weapons out there. My Warrior is lvl 37 right now and using a WS and a Venumous Axe. He seems to be having a harder time of holding agro that I used to. ( I see alot of complaints on the boards about agro problems so maybe its not just that I'm only 37 and cant use alot of agro weapons yet do to req lvl to proc)<br />
Anyway, I'm trying to plan what weapons to get 1st, and how to progress from there as my lvl's increase. I was thinking of adding a frostbringer to my venomous axe once I hit lvl 40. Then replacing the Ven. Axe with a sword of the bloodsworn. <br />
Is that the way to go? And if so how should I progress from there?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any advice in advance.<br />

Frostbringer procs at 40 or 45 I think. I wouldn't worry about agro at your level since mobs don't hit for nearly as much as the trash at level 65.<br />
<br />
Stick to using the Provoke disc line and taunt. If ppl are continually pulling agro off you ask them to watch their trigger happiness or buy one of those machines that lets you stab people in the face over the internet.</div></div><hr />
