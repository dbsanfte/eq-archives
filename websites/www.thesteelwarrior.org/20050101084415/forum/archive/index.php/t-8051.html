But hey, you can get quests there now if you have faction.  Ok, now everyone that remembers when everything you hit in Kunark gave you negative Ring of Scale faction, raise your hand.</div></div><hr />

Of course, it doesn't help you with Scales of Veeshan, who used to be all the wurms and stuff in VP. If it's still that way, you're screwed anyway. Have a nice day!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Kill 5 easy drakes that surround this quest npc.  Then talk to him and he gives you info on the quest and a container.  You need 3 essences of the brood(guessing from talendor/sev maybe, not sure) and the brood blood.  The brood blood I'm pretty sure is from this red con dragon that gets spawned &quot;Suled Dar's Shade&quot; in Skyfire.  Currently staring at it right now but from what I heard it drops 48 bloods or something, looks like a raid mob.  <br />
<br />
Stats so far on the dragon look like quad 2400 but that could be wrong.  2 AE's, one that is a 2k ae that dispells 2-4 buff slots.  Sounds like you pretty much can't keep up with the dispells,  doesn't seem too hard to resist though.  I was hit by it without bard song but resisted with it(elemental chorus)  Guessing probably a -200 prismatic check or -200 mr.  The other AE is http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4125&amp;source=Live  but seems to have a longer range than listed.  AE ramp and single target knockback it seems.</div></div><hr />

Good to see Haass' guildmates share his cynicism.  :)<br />

You are wrong about not being able to do anything if you're not in an EP level guild though.</div></div><hr />

Combining the blood and the old key makes new key.  <br />
<br />
If you dont' have the old key, you need to get the 3 essences + the blood</div></div><hr />

<br />
You kill Suled Dar's Shade, you get a book from him, you give it to the dragon guarding VP's entrance to get some blood, and then you combine the blood + the old key to get the new key (which is a 30 30 30 aug)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Northerner</div><div class="date">07-15-2004, 02:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It you still have three parts of the old key (as I and many of my friends do) then, ignore what was changed.  <br />
<br />
Damn man, I was unuber before but I spent ~100 hours on the key thinking I'd see a tooth someday.  Now, no question... I am in a far more able guild but asking mates to go to (*&amp;(* OS to kill Trak?  I mean really, I might as well ask them to go to PoS and killl a big Bixie.<br />
<br />
Is it possible?  Of course, anything is possible.  But I think the devs don't really get how it works anymore.  Unless you present +Tacvi loot then noone will go much.  The restriction is not so much uber v not, it's those that will v those that might. Revamp VP is decidedly those that might.</div></div><hr />

Why do you bother playing?  Are you a cyber-masochist? :confused:</div></div><hr />

How did they avoid being banished?</div></div><hr />

It's, uh, exhilerating. There's also the 'yo-yo' strategy: He must proc to port you. If and only if you are the only person on his aggro list, the sequence of events goes roughly: *voop* 'You will not evade me!' *voop* 'You will not evade me!'</div></div><hr />

waou, we must have no pb with stomach for the &quot; ban / sommon / fight / ban / summon / fight / ... &quot; strategy, because it must be sicking after a while.</div></div><hr />

This is correct.  I have the 15/15/15 aug from doing the new quest.</div></div><hr />

I've seen &quot;get the essence of X from echo of X&quot; but that's it - I'm looking for spawn information, rarity of drop (number dropped?), location in zone...maybe even faction hits? Anyone know any of this?</div></div><hr />

You need good faction and you need some time.  Three of the quests are practically solo-able, but one requires you have solid COV faction.</div></div><hr />

Are the quest npcs for these quests able to be gotten to without fighting, in other words, if I get the key and faction can I just zone in and head to the quest givers?</div></div><hr />

Throw me a tell on Vigdis or Melcindria on Povar and we can gab!</div></div><hr />

Everything in there is on RoS faction except the basilisks so if you stay out of the lava you are free to wander around and sightsee/quest/whatever.  Take an invis potion because you have to get in range of the lava to get one of the bridges down but for the most part you can wander freely with no worries.  Occasionally there is a see invis basilisk up but with care you can avoid that.<br />
<br />
Ok, untilI get my key, anyone know what is a good way to improve my faction with the quest givers while I wait for an opportunity?<br />
<br />
Mistmoore.  Probably the easiest way to faction as a melee is to get a cleric or druid to go with you and then pull a train (you have to pull to get on the agro list of all the mobs) and the caster AE them when you get back to camp.<br />
<br />
<br />
The quests are fun to do with nice rewards.  Most can be done easily with one group.  Yes some of them take some time - be prepared to spend several hours in some of the camps if you want a drop for everyone.  But there is enough variety that it keeps it fun.  Visiting old zones you haven't seen in years some of them so easy you could duo it others needing a decent group - I enjoyed the quests more then most things I've done in EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sargeras</div><div class="date">07-25-2004, 05:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been factioning in MM since I got my key (finally). A friend gave me her Earthshaker before she quit EQ, and it owns for this. I can pull about 1/3 of the zone, find a corner, and take them out with DS and proc. Wash-rinse-repeat.<br />
<br />
I've been doing this for about ~3 hours a night for the last 3 or 4 days. Sometimes alone, sometimes with a caster or two. One night, with a wiz, I wanted to see how many I could get in one pull... which turned out to be everything except the back valley where the shaman epic dog is. I ended up killing her (too many stuns to cast), busted Fort and cornered myself so procs can finish the train off. I've gone from max-KOS to amiably. I think amiably has the largest range in the faction table, but we'll see.<br />
<br />
I should have logged my kills so I can make MS Word count how many I killed. Oh well :P</div></div><hr />
