I had to kill about 8 rats to finally get one for a friend. Got mine by accident :p<br />
<br />
The PoD piece only drops off Piles of Bile, if memory serves correctly, been a while since i was there hunting. Just mass slaughter the oozes and you'll get one pretty quick, took me a half hour or so.</div></div><hr />
