<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jaxter</div><div class="date">09-12-2004, 09:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My warrior is finally getting to that age (lvl41 barbarian) where he will soon be taking on a wider variety of mob types, and I was wondering if I can get some advice on weapon switching. In what situations is a wep shift warranted, what weps to use for different mob types, and anything else you can think of. Also, how important is the piercing skill? It's the one weapon skill I have that is still limited in skill level. In my experience with my other toons, I've not seen many warriors wielding them. Are there also certain circumstances that make piercers valuable? Any pearls of wisdom will be welcomed and appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">09-12-2004, 12:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You don't need to worry about swapping weapons in and out and around for a long time yet.  Just get the best weapons you can afford and use them full time.<br />
<br />
The only time people swap weapons around is for utility : IE, swap in a weapon for slow or snare or something, and then when they get the proc they want, they switch back to their best weapons.  There's not really any compelling reason to do a juggling act in mainstream EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Peon25</div><div class="date">09-12-2004, 01:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's mostly due to the fact piercers just are not meant for Warriors.. mainly a Rogue/Bard selection of weapons. You don't find many piercers that have a good agro setting on them, go good with a shield for Paladin/SK, or are very Beastlord-like. Even the 2h piercers are pretty weak except for the Knight-only types.<br />
<br />
Sony decided to make Warriors use Slash most of the time, and 1h-Blunt if there's no 1h-Slash nearby.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frostpaw</div><div class="date">09-13-2004, 02:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Max all your weap skills and use the best weaps you can find regardless of whether they are slash/pierce/blunt 1handed or 2handed. At your level they all have the same skill cap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KermeyKhazi</div><div class="date">09-13-2004, 02:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know this isnt exactly on the same lines as this post but what is the quickest way to switch out weapons. Say I am using 2hs and mid fight I want to switch to my Aggro combo. Rather then click and drag is there an easy way to hot key the switch?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Skurge</div><div class="date">09-13-2004, 02:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is no way to hotkey a weapon switch.  You could get a modified UI that shows the inventory slots so you can set them up in a way to have them right there and not use your hotbuttons. Or open up the inventory window.  I use a modified bag that has some inventory/equipment slots on it to do weapon changes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telen</div><div class="date">09-13-2004, 04:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Modified UI bag is the best way to switch weapons.  Keep the bag open at all times and just drag the weapon  up to the open inv slot in the bag.<br />
<br />
I switch out moderately frequently.  My typical aggro setup is SoD/CHoS.  Sometimes I'll just stick with GSoT, just depending on how much aggro I really need depending on the group make up.  I'll swap in an anklesmasher if I need to snare.  I'll swap in a ToD if I need to slow.  I'll swap in a GSot4W if I want DPS.  I'll swap out the SoD with a SotB if I want to stun a higher level mob since SoD only works to 55 (or GSoT since it works to 65 also).  So, yeah, there are definitely occasions to swap out weapons, but they aren't that common.  I could use a GSoT pretty much all the time as long as I had a slower and snarer in group or the mobs didn't run as many don't in a lot of the zones I fight.<br />
<br />
As for piercing.  I never spent any time on it.  Only time I found I needed it was when I went to do loyalist shield quest, and if you don't buy the ashes you're going to need some piercing skill.  But heh, I can't see any real compelling reason.  Just make sure to keep *all* of your other weapon skills maxxed, or close enough so if you get a great weapon of any type you will be able to effectively use it right off the bat.  I use 1HS, 1HB, and 2HB all the time.  I don't really use 2HS much, but someday I might get my hands on a BoW, and then I'll need the skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varalla</div><div class="date">09-13-2004, 05:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In my hotkey box of the default UI, I put my primary and secondary slots on the bottom two keys (Do this by pressing and holding the cursor over your inventory slots till it sticks to the cursor. I hope that made sense)<br />
<br />
In a key above those two, I have a inventory slot also pasted there. (Ususaly for Earthshaker)<br />
<br />
When doing LDoN and its a huge bad pull, Ill swap the secondary with Earthshaker, then swap earthshaker for primary, Rampage, Furious, then switch back in reverse order.<br />
<br />
If Im messing around with and aggro happy XP group I will substitute the Earthshaker for my GSot4W with life tap.<br />
Build aggro till I see about 4 rage procs, then swap into the GSot4W and contribute to group DPS.<br />
<br />
If Im main slower (Dont ask) Ill put Truncheon of doom in the spot.<br />
<br />
If Im tanking a raid level mob where I spend most of the time soloing it (Saryn comes to mind), Ill put my Stormriders Carapice there.<br />
<br />
Im sure there are other situations that warrent quick convenient weapon switching, but to be honest, its normally just my Earthshaker sitting there waiting for an &quot;Oh shit!&quot; situation so I can get AE Aggro and save AE taunt for later. (With a bad pull, AE taunt is a temporary solution. If not mezzed or offtanked, someone will peel and add from you and things start to get really hairy. AE nuking first and saving AE Taunt for later in the fight can ususaly save the group)<br />
<br />
EDIT: Heres an example where I had my shield at the ready for swap in.<br />

Not something that has to be done very often. I just hotkey the spot the Primal is in then swap out, very easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Plumppoopsie</div><div class="date">09-14-2004, 10:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">most of the time I switch weapons, know well in advance, so not an issue in speed:<br />
<br />
- Best agro I have when MAing<br />
- Best DPS (other then my agro settup) when not MAing<br />
- Best shield and 1 hander, used mainly on perma-rooted mobs where agro can be stacked before engage .. but stoped using this when I got my BoW.<br />
<br />
have a ToD, but find in my bags most of the time, but a bad timed LD or something, have switched it in too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elfried</div><div class="date">09-14-2004, 12:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use following weapon-switches for soloing:<br />
<br />
1. Truncheon of Doom till mob is slowed<br />
2. Good DPS weapon<br />
3. mob starts running at 20% health -&gt; equip dual Bloodpoints for some lifetaps until mob is dead<br />
<br />
With this Tactic, Fungi Tunic, Troll regen and good AC warrior soloing is no problem. (At least up to my level, 59 now)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">didiaquarr</div><div class="date">09-15-2004, 08:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a prismatic (avatar proc) that I swap in fairly regularly.  It seems that some mobs tend to 'respect' (i.e. get better aggro) a 2h-er more than others.  I fully admit that this is probably all in my head...  (but hey... we're all playing a virtual reality fantasy game... if you can't go with what's all in your head... what are you doing?) .  I could maybe see myself swapping in a shield part way into a MT fight on a really hard hitting mob... Don't know if it would be worth the extra AC, but as long as you're holding aggro, can't see how it would hurt.  <br />
<br />
I also have a Marsinger Gem 4 that sits in my range slot.  I do sometimes need to put a bow in, though way less since Incite came out.  <br />
<br />
I use the SARS UI that has a bank of customizable slots for inventory slots.  I keep 3 inv slots clear for use with the swapping.  What goes where changes.</div></div><hr />
