<br />
Was just wondering which bracer you would wear:<br />
<br />
AC: 43<br />
STR: +4  DEX: +5  STA: +6  HP: +45  <br />
ENDUR: +35  SV DISEASE: +3  SV COLD: +3  SV POISON: +4<br />
Attack: +10<br />
(Kizrak's with a 15 ac aug)<br />
<br />
OR<br />
<br />
AC: 28<br />
DEX: +6 STA: +7 CHA: +5 WIS: +8 INT: +8 HP: +75 MANA: +75 ENDUR: +75<br />
SV FIRE: +8 SV COLD: +8 SV POISON: +8<br />
(Mana-Threaded Bone Bracelet with a 7 sta aug)<br />
<br />
Here is a link to my magelo if that has an effect on your oppinion (currently wearing the above Kizrak bracer):<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Mana threaded, drop the sta aug and slap on a AC aug. The hitpoints are superior, you shouldn't worry about sta too much, any decent amount of buffage should max it out. I wouldn't switch till I get it AC aug'd though. The cha is a nice bonus too. However, it really is dependant on how long you will being wearing it. It'll be hard to justify reaugmenting for just a few months of useage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>waza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I will personnaly go with mana threaded bracelet with 15 ac aug. If u are thinking of buying a bracer i'd rather buy Crystallized Acid Bracer (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=12394). I am currently planning to put 15ac aug on it as soon as i got one.<br />
<br />
Waza</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">CAB usually run high in price, so I would look towards the mana threaded.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ecchu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">where do 15ac augs drop? ferubi?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>waza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">where do 15ac augs drop? ferubi?<br />
<br />
2 ac15 aug drops in ferubi, yes.<br />
<br />
Waza</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I have a follow-up question --<br />
<br />
If we assume that for each point of stamina, we get 6 hit points, then the number of hit points for each of those items is this:<br />
1) Augmented Kizrak's == 81 hit points<br />
2) Augmented MTBB == 117 hit ponits<br />
<br />
The MTBB, therefore, wins that comparision with 36 more hit points. <br />
<br />
On the other hand, if we look at the AC, then you see this:<br />
1) Augmented Kizrak's == 43 AC<br />
2) Augmented MTBB == 28 AC<br />
<br />
This makes the Augmented Kizrak's a clear winner with 15 more AC.<br />
<br />
Which leads to my question: why would you choose 36 hit points over +15 AC? Those extra 36 hit points would evaporate in half a tick, whereas the +15 AC would factor into every swing the mob took at you, right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yes, but how MUCH do you think +15 AC factors into those swings?<br />
 <br />
It's been demonstrated that +100 AC changes the mob's modal hit by 1 DI. (See the library if you are unfamiliar with this.)<br />
 <br />
Now, you and I may have different opinions on how significant 1 DI is. But we can probably agree that +15 AC, on its own, is not going to make a very significant difference to the damage you receive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>zcao</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">1) Augmented Kizrak's == 43 AC<br />
2) Augmented MTBB == 28 AC<br />
<br />
Bah ornate and MRBB have same AC, MTBB is clearlly better, above comment is not correct</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Mourneblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I would say MTBB would be ideal given the fact that sometimes you just need raw stats because you might not have that pocket shammy to buff you.   God knows how many times I run around grouping and just when the killing gets good, my shammy buffs fail.  It's always nice to have stat items to help offset the buff loss.<br />
<br />
That's just my 2 cents of course... I don't like relying on buffs to be effective.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Daabu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">To determine this, look at the unaugged bracers.  You have an unauged kizrak at 28ac 45hp, and you have an unaugged MTBB at 28ac 75hp.<br />
<br />
You have a +15ac aug on the kizrak, I'd say put the +15ac aug on the MTBB instead.<br />
<br />
If, however, you were wearing both bracers, and you upgraded one, and you just want to know which you should wear until you get a second bracer, I'd suggest wearing the Kizrak's for now.<br />
<br />
If you have a while before you upgrade bracer again, I'd hold out for another +15ac augment (or if you already have both augs, remove one before going to ferubi next time you go) and slapping it on the MTBB.<br />
<br />
If you are going to get a new bracer within the next 3 weeks or whatever, just stick with the Kizraks, wash off the sta aug and sell/twink the MTBB.</div></div><hr />
