<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hudeman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey everyone, I've been out of EQ since shortly after PoP came out and I am looking to get back in, so I'm looking for some advice on some upgrades.  Being out of the loop for so long I have no idea what's hot and whats not anymore.  Here is my profile http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=206813 <br />
<br />
I've got 20k to spend atm, I'm looking for things mostly in the 20k and under price range.  I will greatly appreciate any help</div></div><hr />

Since you got the bracer of benelovance why not doing either the strength of elements or draconic vampraces quest.  Other slots look into SS MQ since you got the faction already.<br />

Neck Clattering Bone Necklace</div></div><hr />

<br />
heh I would but I blew that a few ToV raids right b4 I quit, thanks though I will look into those other items<br />
<br />
I was thinking, maybe I need some better weapons and haste, what do you think?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">hmm  Droga Weapons are King right now.   Copper Hammer of striking and Sword of the Bloodsworn are great for 1hs aggro weapons for 2hb Greatstaff of thunder can now be cheaply obtained in the bazaat and it is decent for aggro. <br />
<br />
Here is my magelo I am a bazaar bought Tank.  Hopefully it can give you some Ideas.  There is a new Haste Belt from Veksar that can be easily obtained by a group of level 60s called a soulscream belt,  it has 31% haste and on tunare it cost around 17k<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Hudeman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks again, I'm getting a good idea of what to look for now.  I think I'm going to pursue one of those soulscream belts it seems like a simple enough camp.<br />
What's up with those GSoTs? they are so cheap I got one for 150p, is something wrong with them or are they just common as the flu?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">They are common drop man.. I paid 50K for mine and they were rare as Tunare leaving her panties on.  They opened the Teir two and teir three to the masses and up the drop rate.  I was mad but now more warriors can afford a decent aggro weapon and that is a plus.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm a fan of my GSoT .. I have the Sword of the Bloodworn in the Primary, and my offhand changes a lot.  I'll try the Copper Hammer when I can get a group together to camp it. (Plat is a big issue for me atm, and I have some belief that I should camp or quest what I can!  Esp. since I'm not doing the epic.)<br />
<br />
In the spirit of bargains I point to the Crinose Cape of the Werewolf (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=23258).  It's much cheaper in the bazaar than the Pernicity cloak.  That'd leave you with plenty to spread around for stuff like Valorium Rings, Earring of the Solstice, and such.<br />

Nice grip, btw - I'm a little envious :).</div></div><hr />

???? What do you mean again you stumped me with the voodoo that you do....WITH words</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hehe ... it's slang I picked up somewhere, mebbe from some movie types of past acquaintance.<br />
<br />
Grip as in &quot;gear&quot;.  His toys are a little better than mine, but close enough to what I'm currently working for that I'm a tiny bit envious ;).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">ahhhh  I guess I got to get with the times.  DO they print slang for dummies</div></div><hr />
