<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grimrod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was our first time.  Went without a hitch.  One question.  Does it strike you weird that the entire time you're fighting your way to a god, killing some lower level named and such, that the only parchments that drop are etherals in a Tier 2 zone and the only spectral to drop the entire time is off the goddess herself?  Tier 1 sure you would expect that, but in a Tier 2 zone, at least some specs off the other named instead of etherals, sheesh:mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Roma</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Tier 2 aka PoV all you have is ethereals off the trash and mininameds. I don't remember what zone that mob is in, but spectrals don't appear much til T3 specifically BoT and/or HoH. When I did the AD fight all we got was ethereals off the golems w/ AD. Spectrals probably DO drop off the mininameds but its probably a lot rarer than you would like :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Korinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You can add ethereals dropping where specs should to the long list, you know they should drop, i know they should drop, VI knows they should drop, but VI too lazy or too busy making another expansion or fucking up PoEb keys to fix it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grimmlokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Short of the gods/bosses I'd say nothing in tier 2 zones should drop specs.<br />
<br />
 The most asenine eth dropper by far is Bertoxx=P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nevian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">/em kicks bertoxx<br />
<br />
