<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Angelusx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok I just got a full set of the royals gear and wanted too begin aug'ing them. I was thinking. A 40hp aug. the 13ac aug. and veng 4 or 5(not sure if you can get 5 from ldon). If anyone knows what slot one's I have too get in order too use the combo and what camps and how much each costs I would really apreciate it.<br />

You having aspirations to be a DPS class all of a sudden?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well, keeping in mind that there is a Veng 15 cap, I would probably go for that, the one (correct me if there are more) Aura of Battle aug and then HP or regen. I have not looked at how much regen you can stack into the armor, but if it is enouhg (I would be surprised) it might be worth going for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Angelusx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I belive venge 50 is the cap?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>QuirtEvans</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Worn ATK of 250 is what my rogue friends tell me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Worn cap of 250 is the correct answer. I personally don't care about regen, so I'd go vengence. Opinions may vary, but I'd rather pump out more DPS then have the negligable regen. There's certainly an argument to be made that regen adds to your effective hp however.<br />
<br />
  Royal Attendent armor is limited to the visible slots as I recall, so you can't augment it with 10ac augments. Aim for the highest hp combos you can. Use This link (http://www.squidbox.com/ldon) to look up what fits in what slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Most of the time people ignore regen augments because they're already close to the regen cap (35) with their VT ... Elemental ... and Time gear.<br />
<br />
But if you're using that much LDoN armor, odds are you lack quite a bit of regen.<br />
<br />
I find it odd that a bunch of people who's primary purpose it is in the game is to get HIT would desire vengance gear over regen.<br />
<br />
But that's just me.<br />
<br />
:P<br />
<br />
I understand someone rocking a bunch of Raex's would just want to grind out hit point augments and not much else. But if you're trying to fill in slot 3 augments in your LDoN armors, and you overlook the tiny benefit that hit point regen adds to tanking, while seeking out the tiny benefit that 5 ATK is going to add ... it just seems weird to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gharghael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Aye wu, I have to agree with you.<br />
<br />
I'd rather pump out more DPS then have the negligable regen.<br />
<br />
Funny how this is worded to sound like the ATK augs add some sort of noticeable undebatable DPS boost =-D and regen is 'negligable.' Riiight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">ATK &amp; Regen &amp; HP are useless.<br />
<br />
Lets face it.  Having 10 more HP on your BP wont do much.<br />
Now get 10hp on every slot, thats 210hp gained.<br />
<br />
Regen &amp; ATK work exactly the same way.<br />
<br />
EVERY LITTLE BIT HELPS<br />
<br />
Regen is situational (u really dont care about hp/mana efficiency).<br />
Going from 1 CH every 25 sec to 1 CH ever 25.6 sec. Wont change much. <br />
However those extra 10hp at the end of the tick might just<br />
be what you needed to let the CH land.<br />
(You can remember melee purple club, well with 10 less hp<br />
that purple club would had been a &quot;loading please wait&quot;)<br />
<br />
ATK raises DPS. And thats our second role.<br />
<br />
<br />
I would say, put RegenV on the BP or the 8% Dodge.<br />
(8% has unparsable minimal effects on tanking, RegenV is 5/tick)<br />
<br />
And then go for 40hp augments.<br />
Then put the other type2 hp augments. <br />
Once these are done (gonna take a while), make a choice :<br />
<br />
What is more important to you ? DPS or Survivability .<br />
(Knowing that the increase in each will be minimal)<br />
<br />
I'd take suvivability. I'm here to tank not DPS.<br />
Regen all the way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I agree with the poster above!<br />
<br />
:-)<br />
<br />
Every little bit does indeed help. 5 ATK ... 1 hp per tick regen ... 12 hit points ... 10 Charisma ... in the grand scheme of things none of them is going to make or break your character.<br />
<br />
But eh, you've got some type 3 slots to fill. And you're pretty limited in what you can put there. It's up to you which way you go. I just didn't think ATK was all that &quot;superior&quot; an option to regen or enduring breath or the dodge modifier. They all seem kind of equal to me. Go with what you like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>QuirtEvans</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'm interested in Vengeance, but not because I want to pump out more DPS.  Rather, we all know that aggro is at least partially a function of the amount of damage you do.  All else equal, the more damage you do, the better you hold aggro.  We all agree on that, right?<br />
<br />
Our role is twofold: to take hits and live, and to make sure that nobody else is taking hits.  Vengeance should have a small effect on that second role.  And, if that tiny little extra bit of aggro (yes, it's tiny, yes, it's little) keeps the mob from switching targets, then it's worth it.<br />
<br />
In the end, none of this can be proved, so go with your gut and do what feels right to you.  As between Regen and Vengeance, it probably won't make a big difference either way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Actually its not sheer DPS :) More of Potential DPS<br />
<br />
http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=3789<br />
<br />
This is the reason u can go with a long series of missing having <br />
a good 2hander (See Sews/Blade of Was) and still retain agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Uukla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Attack won't give you any agro, as the above link will show.  Doing a ton of damage with the offhand weapon wont do anything for agro, etc.<br />
<br />
BUT<br />
so, lets look at vengence 4 vs regen 5.  28? attack vs 50 regen a minute.  You are looking at about a 2percent plus increase in DPS.<br />
<br />
If your dps is 100, then you are now doing 102 dps.<br />
<br />
Just like you can argue that 50 hps a minute might save your bacon on a CH, you can also argue that the 120 damage in a minute might finish off the mob before it might finish you.<br />
<br />
If you regularly group with a cleric, I would say regen is a total waste vs worn attack.  If you group with druid or shaman healers regularly, regen will play a bigger role.<br />
<br />
Also, worn attack will be better in a low stress situation when you arnt taking much damage and all that matters is damage.<br />
IMO, even at max regen, you are getting 350 hps a minute that you wernt getting before.  5 percent a minute, maximum.  With 250 worn attack, you are getting 25 percent more DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Qest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">How do you figure 10atk=1% damage?<br />
<br />
I'm not saying you're wrong, I'm just curious how you came to the result.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gurgeh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">It really depends on what you are doing. Regen is every tick, in a raid encounter this means 3 CH / tick, so you're getting 1 hp regen is in average the equivalent of 1/3 raw hp. It 'might' save you one day, but will it save your raid more than having your war getting more atk ? how many time did your guild failed with mob at 0% 1% ? then if your 4 - 5 war had 10% more dps would have you done it ? Imo in a raid situation where regen is negligible in front of mob dps, it's useless.<br />
<br />
In normal adv, regen might mitigate about 5% of the mobs dps, it's not that bad. But if you are running normal adv, again dps &gt; regen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">The DPS gained from those tiny amounts of ATK is just as negligible as the regen everyone keeps looking at.<br />
<br />
V-2 will not make or break your raid, just like you all agree 1 to 2 hp per tick of regen won't.<br />
<br />
Trust me on that one. My V-6 hasn't saved my guild's raids. Ever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>ThrokRock</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Are there any AC augs that ARE type 1 or 3?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Warfust</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I think those are both Type All now</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Vengence and Regen are both equally unimportant if you ask me.  Get whatever you want, but I would go for AC/Hps.  You could even put in some kind of a utility aug like ultravision or Enduring breath</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Ogah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I like Brutul's idea - AC/HP.  Get hit less, less hard, and less effectively.  Regen is great, but if you only have 2000hps, I don't care how high your regen is, you're dead after 2 rounds of attacks - at the higher levels.  Mitigate the damage you take and you can survive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Zynth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">well, the guy said he has a full suit, so i'd think the obvious answer is to get the 40hp aug for each, then mix and match vengance, regen and aura of battle and get the best of both worlds. <br />
<br />
on a side note, most people dont consider the effect regen has on countering a DoT</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Ulic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I agree that regen and vengeance are basically useless on raid mobs. Nothing has ever saved my ass besides hps and ac.<br />
<br />
If you are looking to fill your type 3 slots, I would suggest utilities. 8% dodge seems to be popular with the warriors I know...also see invis, enduring breath, and 36% haste if you are lacking.<br />
<br />
After utilities, regen vs. atk is really a personal preference. If you can't decide, use aura of battle. There are also a lot of stat augments that are all type. If you feel that your stats need a boost, this is another option.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">regen helps in AE fights if you are not tanking for raid mobs so dont say its useless</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Klozz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I have been keeping an eye on this thread because I am really close to getting 1592 adventure points in Tak.  I will have a total of 3k and some change, and I really want to get the Royal Attendant BP with the best augs on it that I can get.  <br />
<br />
The 40hp in slot 2 seems like a shoe-in.  <br />
<br />
Slot 3, it would be nice to put the 10AC aug in, but I just read that the 10 AC aug is only for the non-visible slots, and will not go on the BP.  I think the next best bet is the Regen V aug.  I don't want to go Vengence, because I think that 5hps a tick is a much more desireable effect.  <br />
<br />
Slot 1, it appears that you just have to slap the best aug that drops from your adventures.  I saw someone mention the 5AC aug, but again, this aug does not seem to work on the chest slot.  So I guess I would hold out for the best +hp aug or perhaps a save vs. magic aug. <br />
<br />
Can anyone shoot holes in my logic?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Well, I personally would throw in one of the ALL/ALL augs from the various camps. Given the stats on the BP, I'd go with the Polished Orb of Power from Guk (663 points) for the Slot 1 spot - STR 8 DEX 8 is a hell of a lot better than 6 some random thing. Or, if you want specifics, the various +10 augs are scattered around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Your logic is sound Klozz.<br />
<br />
It's your breastplate. If that's the augment you want, you're going to be happier going with the thing you want. Remember, as many in this thread have pointed out, all of these augments have small uses. None are all that superior. Whether it's a dodge augment, a Vengance augment or a Regen augment, it'll just be a tiny gain in power. So go with the one that you actually WANT to use. You'll be much happier.<br />
<br />
Good luck in whatever you choose.</div></div><hr />

Totally stupid choice. <br />

600AP ... Thats 1 Ykesha proc , or Anger 2.<br />

600AP .... Thats 20hp (40hp cost 1150)<br />
<br />
Are you telling me 8Str/Dex can compete with any of these ?<br />
<br />
<br />
For all armor you will buy from this day &amp; on :<br />
Type 1 : 10AC (if possible) or RandomShit01<br />
Type 2 : Pure HP<br />
Type 3 : Utility (haste/ultravisioin/endurebreath/atk/regen)</div></div><hr />

Assuming it is unaugmented :)<br />
8 Type2 Armor Slots x  1150<br />

Thats another 20k points to fully augment.  200-400 more Adventures.<br />

But itsnt it a waste when for the same 200 400 600 you could<br />

I sincerely doubt that he's gonna be able to max EVERYTHING with the visible LDoN armor and whatever other drops he gets in LDoN + the Bazaar from his Adv. cash.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">+7 drops in hard</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>zito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I'm almost to the point of buying some Tak gear now.  Murphy's law, it's the last camp I have to unlock other than Guk.  Once I start getting augments, I'll pick Vengeance over regen.  IMO, at least for myself, regen IS negligible, even more so than Vengeance.  For myself, this is how I view it.  <br />
<br />
Take a raid situation.  If you are tanking, you'll go from full HP to dead, if it happens, in at most a few seconds.  Time for 1 or maybe 2 ticks of regen, at most.  So I view it as you're only really getting 1-2 ticks of worth out of that regen aug.  I've been purple-clubbed 2 times that I can ever remember, and about 2 weeks ago I caught a CH at 0%, where I was for probably about 3 seconds that seemed to last for a year.  That's in 3 years of playing.  If not tanking, such as taking AE damage while playing DPS...  Usually, at least in my own exp, group heals are used in this situation.  This means that the person doing the healing is going to be doing their healing time based upon the needs of the person in the group who's HP are melting away the quickest.  Rarely is that the warrior in the group.  We are already the best equipped to survive AE; regen just makes us that much better.<br />
<br />
However, with added attack; that attack bonus is cumulative throughout the entire length of the fight.  If you get 10 melees on a mob, and each melee has increased their DPS by anywhere from 5-20 percent *just numbers pulled out of my head, not sure how much extra attack ads to DPS*, that mob is going to be dead a lot quicker.<br />
<br />
In a non-raid situation, such as LDoN, regen is even more useless to me.  Right now, LDoN is far and away how I spend most of my EQ play time, and it's usually with the same group.  As it is right now, cleric mana is never an issue, unless in the rare case of an extremely bad pull with 4 or more mobs.  Hell, our cleric is our puller... not because of the needed paci or anything, but because he's bored.  Extra regen won't do anything at all in this case.  However, getting those mobs dead even a few seconds quicker is at least SOMETHING, minor and trivial as it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Khumak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">The DPS increase from 10 ATK is going to depend on what weapons you're using, what your haste is, what your previous ATK was, what buffs you have, etc.  So there's no way to say that any number of ATK gives some static percentage of DPS increase because it's different for everyone that doesn't have exactly the same ATK, buffs, haste, and weapons.<br />
<br />
If my ATK was 2100 and I raise it by 10 that's going to increase my DPS by a lot less than someone who's sitting at 1200 ATK and raises his by 10.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>zeeko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">It's been a month since this thread was last active and I wanted to find out what people felt after having the time to aug the armor and see if it helps.  I'm at the point of figuring out what type3 aug I want for the Tak armor, specifically the arms in my case.  Right now I'm leaning for the veng4 aug, but I've also considered trying to wait for a 15hp type 1 aug to drop in hards.  <br />
<br />
Another questions is regarding the GoD augs, are they in any of the web databases outside magelo yet?  Maybe I can aim for one of those and put it in the type 3 if it's an all type aug. (no idea as I haven't seen them yet)</div></div><hr />
