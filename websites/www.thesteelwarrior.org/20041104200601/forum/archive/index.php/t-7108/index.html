<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mashor Dabashor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am looking to begin farming the named mobs in the first wall castle in PoF as I am looking to aquire for myself and a few guildmembers the Charm of Defence.  Been through it many times but besides pulling a few mobs for guild killings of the General I'm in ignorance of this camp.  Where do most groups set up? Inside of or just outside the castle? Also wondering if the 4 mini named can appear randomly from any spawn point or are there particular buildings we need to keep clear. Any advice would be appreciated.  Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

On Druzzil Ro it seems to be smack in the middle. On Morell it's on the wall off to the left of the stairs leading to charm birds.</div></div><hr />
