<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">what a joke, nothing else was up so we cleard up to the 3rd avatar only to have that silly hammer as one of the drops. talk about something that should be on the minis instead. just a little vent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Chatja ogre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">On our second kill at 1am with like 35 people, we got 2 hammers! :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">actually the Krizzik axe and 3rd Avatar 1hb are pretty nice dps and stats, I think around Emp level for dps, and certianly has it use's..... superior for tanking for sure, just sucks after a few kills and most knights prefer 2 hand weapons</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Chatja ogre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It sucks having zero sks and getting 2 of thos damn clubs on a kill like that !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">the item is nice, but like chatja, we have few sks and fighting up the 3rd island in poa to get junk just sucks. it should drop off one of those minis if anything.<br />
<br />
i wouldnt complain so much if it was like the cloak off firetail or mask off pyro which a ton of classes could use, but the hammer is gonna rot unless someone gets their alt up there to loot it. its not like there are a ton of helm droppers as it is, EVERYONE would prefer he just drop the molds !<br />
<br />
just another example of crap itemization that has plagued this entire expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The earring and the haste ring from Avatar of Mist are both pretty good.  I'm not sure what the SK weapon is doing there though.<br />
<br />
As for tanking, shield doesn't make that much of a difference because it's unlikely you'd put a Knight to offtank something that is actually capable of killing you for extended amount of time.  Knights are always quite capable of getting aggro without doing any damage whatsoever.</div></div><hr />
