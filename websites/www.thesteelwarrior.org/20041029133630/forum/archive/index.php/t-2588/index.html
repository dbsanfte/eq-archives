<br />
Is anyone having problems spawning this Avatar?<br />
<br />
No matter how many times we clear that stupid island, the name to trigger the Avatar never spawns other than right after a patch. If you ask me that another guild may have took it down, well after 3 days it should be respawnable but it just simply never does.<br />
<br />
This is seriously a huge block to guilds trying to attempt Xegony. Not only that, it's been broken for WEEKS.<br />
<br />
I also seriously believe /feedback is worthless.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Chatja ogre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Im almost sure the respawn of AoSmoke has been broken for a long time and has also been addressed once on these boards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">only spawns on server up, just plain sad it hasnt been fixed by now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>skycrasher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Broken. GM's say they are looking into it and passing it onto the Devs, I don't think they are. This spawn has been busted for at least 1 month.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tinmari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">My guild is new to elementals.  Which Island is for Avatar of Smoke so I can warn them that's it's broken.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wychway</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">At least a month? Try ever since elemental planes were first accessed. Too long. Second island, elementals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">its been broke several months, maybe since the game went live even. its really just pathetic. no one is going to cry too loud though, because the zone plane sucks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Frax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">has been broken since april/may for sure</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ainian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It's been broken since December 02 :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Beeffy Jeerky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">we killed him just over a week ago.  ( no problems spawning him)  Then we tried him recently and the Trigger  didnt even spawn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Danathor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The respawn only seems to get bugged after the event is failed.  It respawns properly until someone fails it afaik.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Wychway</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Nope. We kill it, it won't respawn.</div></div><hr />
