Does this just become a game for the developers to play? We've gone from paladin epic not even beating a 1:1 ratio to nearing a 3:1 ratio. If everyone can do 500 dps soon what happens to the older zones? :P As long as you can group with someone you could destroy your way up an dlevel them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We've had dps for a long while now =(.  OoW is getting pretty crazy with ratios i agree. This 2h actually has me debating on weather or not to pick it up when it drops for us or not.  Probably stick with DW for life though P..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Fenring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">And 330 MANA!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Aonodorus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">considering the kind of pain that tanking comes with at the point in the game where that drops, i don't know if sacrificing the ac on a duel wield setup, or the shielding/spell shielding for any turtles out there, is really worth it honestly.  looks more like a toy for when you're not gonna be the one getting your ass beaten.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Warrior only weapons are invariably the worst ratio weapons out of all classes since for some inexplicable reason it's deemed that everyone else has to have better ratios.  If a class is supposed to do more damage than Wars (i.e. monks) they get better ratio than us.  If a class is supposed to do less damage than Wars (bard, beastlord, paladin, SK) they get better ratio too to make up for having worse offensive skills.<br />
<br />
I think the best source for DPS for a War would be to use a Knight 2hander that they forgot to exclude Warrior from using.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Well i am using a  65/35 + Stun. So far i am really happy with it. <br />
<br />
Now of course its gonna be an agro/tanking downgrade for DBlade/Brutish/Fleshbiter warriors.<br />
<br />
But for the ones without its gonna be a huge all situation weapon.<br />
Not to mention a great DPS tool.<br />
<br />
65/35+Stun+A3 does some very serious DPS.<br />
As for the agro, while it lacks snap agro (not enough procs) given some time, it locks it well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">You could look at it from the other way around, I guess.   Warriors don't need as solid a ratio to do the equivalent dps as a Knight (just using Knights as an example).  <br />
<br />
One of my best friends, who now plays a wizard, played a shadowknight for the better part of about two years.  The first thing he said when he fired up my toon was, &quot;Wow, you just swung six times with a 2hander...&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">:eek: OMFG :eek:<br />
this beats everything !!<br />
I made some a priori tests : with breal's hate formula (DM+DB*1.4) we end up with :<br />
1. max offencive AA -&gt; around 2.5 swings per round for 2Her and around 2 swings per round 1Her mainhand and 0.9 swing per round 1Her offhand<br />
2. 130% haste<br />
3. DB at lvl 65<br />
4. WA5 CE0<br />
mainhand<br />
BoW 2.0 around 13047 hate per min from swings +Anger*3 +aug*3 +buff*1.6<br />
BBB around 5181 hate per min from swings +Anger*3 +aug*3 +buff*1.6<br />
DBotW around 4284 hate per min from swings +Anger*3 +aug*3 +buff*1.6  +0.6*Anger<br />
offhand<br />
epic 1.5 around 1437 hate per min from swings +aug*2*1.5<br />
D the Painsipper around 1642 hate per min from swings + 100DD*1.5 +aug*1.5<br />
C B Scimitar around 1652 hate per min from swings +(80HP Heal + 100HP rune)*1.5 + aug*1.5<br />
I estimate the 100DD at 66 hate and the runic at 100 hate<br />
doing so, the best DW combo seams to be BBB (if we say that stun&lt;780 hate, other wise it's DBotW) + epic 1.5 (because the two aug slots permit a bigger bonus from procs). since the BOW 2.0 and the BBB have the same procs I remove then whatever their hate generation, I end up with 6430 hate loss from the DW combo before auging the epic. thus the two aug procs in the epic 1.5 need to have 2143 hate value each to cover this difference.<br />
if we use breal stun's hate value (around 1100) then the DBotW is better than the BBB. then the hate difference, counting the DBotW's proc mod, is 6207 or 2068 hate value for each aug in the epic 1.5.<br />
We end up with BoW 2.0 beating the DW combo theoritically.</div></div><hr />

Hello,<br />
<br />
since I know a bit about beastlords let me tell you something:<br />
<br />
Beastlord dps comes from 3 sources: weapon, pet, spells/procs<br />
<br />
Beastlords are normally dualwielders and received 3 AAs to enhance that ability, 1 of those affects 2h too since it gives the beastlord the ~15 pct chance to make a double (yes double, not tripple or flurry and whatnot) attack.<br />
<br />
This might give you a hint about the dps a beastlord has with that 2hb. Its way lower than for a warrior, since Bsts single attack with a 15 pct double attack chance.<br />
<br />
Maybe if the beastlord weapon was 110 / 29 you could start testing if the warrior does less dps with the 73 / 33 in pure melee.<br />
<br />
So please realize that beastlords get alot less out of weapons than all other meleeclasses except bards who are about same.<br />
<br />
It would be more interesting to compare a warrior with this to a ranger or ber with a bonecleaver.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Adaptation is right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Celestias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">I'd probably use that over my Darkblade/Epic 1.5 / JoS setup due to the fact that i've been using weapons that have  had the graphic of Blade of War (Darkblade fits this category) for over 1.5 years and its really annoying that Brutish blade and Tacvi isnt even worth doing now since focuses dont extend to level 70 and Omens has better items coming out of it making all that backflagging and work towards progression almost worthless. That zone has to be one of the biggest end-zone failures ever, since most wont even do it unless it gets a major overhaul even with lvl 70 spells.  <br />
<br />
I think the 73/33 ratio is very nice and even though 4 procs &gt; 2 procs, I feel that the sword can be adjusted to fit the tanking role and do some nice DPS as a side bonus, as well as to differentiate yourself from 3 expansion ago weaponry-looks.  Its nice to have a new model sword to identify with.  I'm sure  a killer warrior 1hander will come out at some point in which I assume most warriors will make the transition from this 2hander (like blade of war) to the &quot;darkblade&quot; of omens (some sort of 1h with anger and a insane ratio probably) :p.  Just what I speculate, it could very well be epic 2.0 that replaces this as the warrior weapon of choice. (which is most likely 1hand like 1.5)</div></div><hr />

<br />
With the Offhand AA's, and the fact that one of the biggest 2h advantage (lack of ripostes) is basically non existant due to how fast 2hders have to be to keep a good ratio, a 2der would have to be simply beastly to really rep or compar ea good DW combo, but something like this will more then suffice for people who lack such a combo.</div></div><hr />

Even Pal/SK Epics1.5 have more ac/shielding than this one.<br />
And are probably a lot easier to get.<br />
<br />
This 2H needs a retune (80ac 4% shielding for example) and its gonna be a great alternative.<br />
<br />
It should not be better than BBB/Epic and probably be tied to Flesh/Epic DBlade/Epic.<br />

Youre forgetting ripostes / double riposte / flurry aa's while tanking, a hard hitting 2her can make quite a splash dps-wise. I agree it would be better served on a warrior without a nice dw combo but I think it would out dps a dbotw / anything combo by quite a bit if tanking.</div></div><hr />

2 hand weapons is in generally overrated. There is a ton of tanks running arround with all kinds of stupid 2handers (like Vanazir), then added some anger augment in it and thinking they have a bow. <br />
The base fact is that every serious tank in everquest has an agro augment in hes weapons. The agro augment is a 0 factor becuase of this. However ppl using 2handers instead of 1handers only have 1 agro augment and 1 proc instead of 2 agro augment and 2 procs wich means that they penalise their ability to hold agro.</div></div><hr />

I cant probably compete with you on pure hate.<br />
But 6 wiz 7 mages dont have any problems nuking with Halbed+A3.<br />

<br />
probably a boc + hategiver setup with anger 3 augments is better agro than this<br />
<br />
Proc on this weapon is over 1k hate ... same exact proc on DBoTWL and BBoB.  Nothing short of a DBoTWL and beyond combo would come close to this weapon bro. <br />
<br />
DBoTWL procs on average 3 times a minute.<br />
BBoB proc on average 2 times a minute.<br />
<br />
BBoB is comparable aggro to the DBoTWL aggro thanks to the far superior ratio.  Though it might not be quite as strong ... it is damn close.  The ratio on this 2hander is astronomical, and as such it would handily own a DB + shield with all the proper aas.  Last time i checked, a DB + shield is substantially higher aggro over time than a BoC/HG + duel anger3.  The question is to what extent does the dps aggro on the BoW 2.0 help in covering the lack of offhand procs which you find these days.  My guess is that it comes within spitting distance, but still lags behind.<br />

While i doubt it would hold aggro as strongly as an endgame warrior aggro weapon mainhand with an endgame aggro weapon offhand both augmented, it would absolutely run circles around anything preceeding it.<br />

If they gave it a proc mod it would hold it's own in today's endgame i'd wager, but without it wont.  A nice weapon indeed, but it would need some tweaking to be of much use to those able to aquire it.  Toss an extra 100hps, 50-100ac, some shielding and a proc mod on it and i'm sure it would be a very formidable weapon for the area of the game it's in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Ocide</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">its a great weapon holds aggro pretty well plus really fun. i think max hit non crit is 531 with champion. i use it all the time in exp groups, don't much for raids, i prefer the shielding from my shield and the shit load more hp. aggro is never really a problem these days even with a shield. maybe adding 3-4 shielding on it would make it more appealing for tanking on raids. tho really dps ain't the job of someone tanking. me staying alive a little longer will far do more dps than i can do with a 2h.</div></div><hr />
