It'd be easier to just freeze the screen rather than switching from the 1st screen (zone1) to the intermediate screen (poopsplash), and then to the new screen (zone2)</div></div><hr />

I'm sure they'll figure out a way to leak on the bmp loads while zoning also.</div></div><hr />

Wanna know what else sucks?  The new fucking corpse decay system.  I find it funny that the week after the WoW stress test, they start using nearly the exact same thing....except NOBODY FUCKING WANTS IT.<br />
<br />
It makes it impossible to loot massive numbers of corpses quickly.  Normally, I'll pull 2-3 rooms, bring them back, butcher them down, and then loot everything when i can't see the floor to save time.  Now the corpses stick around for a few seconds after you loot them just to have some gay ass particle effect decay.  Fuck that shit, I want that changed back, or I want an option to turn it off. <br />
<br />
This is the shakerpage nerf right here.  You wanna kill 150 mobs?  Good luck looting them all in 8 minutes now.</div></div><hr />

This sounds like a problem that shouldn't exist.../hidecorpse not good enough?  I haven't seen a massive problem with corpses that last for mere seconds after looted.  Can't speed loot?  Sounds like someone's crying over spilt milk to me...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't you understand that a corpse that sits there for a few seconds is IN THE WAY OF LOOTING THE NEXT ONE?<br />
<br />
This means, when you have massive piles of bodies on the floor, like you should have in any decent pulling group, there is now a minimum time required to loot them all rather than right click, done, right click, done, right click, done.<br />
<br />
It's also stuff that doesn't need to be there.  It doesn't change the game anyway, and I don't care.  Honestly, I'm happy there are plenty of people in the world who think that stupid little visual shit like that are wasting their time in games...it will keep you guys in different games than me for the rest of my life.</div></div><hr />

I have a theory that any change made to the game, for better or worse, no matter how benign, will cause at least 10 people to show up and whine on the boards about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I ain't gonna argue with you Brutul, because I know how you feel about EQ, but this change is fucking retarded.  You can't spam loot mobs anymore.  You have to sit there and wait for the corpse to rot with sparkly particles instead of it just being gone when you stand up.  How that improves the game, I have no fucking idea.  I do know that it gets in my way and is one more annoyance that doesn't need to be in the game for it to be enjoyable.  Corpses have been disappearing instantly for how many years?  Why the need to change it to a slower system now?</div></div><hr />

You obviously didnt see the stack of mobs at my feet in Fire yesterday. Have to agree with Haas, very annonying. Even more so since I 6box which means I have to do it rather than dedicate some other live person to do it during convenient times during pulls, etc. That being said the effect is kind of cool, just unwanted :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Ejryu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">It is kind of stupid.  At least before, you had something different to look at when zoning, but now you get to see the same screen countless times a night.  The corpse thing looks pretty, but you're right, the looting aspect is annoying.  EQ's cake is rotten, and prettying up the icing isn't going to make it any better.  Focus on content and mechanics rather than candy, plzkthx.  If I wanted a pretty game, I'd log off and play The Guy Game (http://www.atomic-planet.com/games/guygame.htm)  :)</div></div><hr />

Haass: Turn off Shader 2.0 in advance options for display and the corpses go back to normal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
uhh<br />
<br />
Is that on the button as &quot;2.x Pixel shaders?&quot;  If it is, it's off, and it hasn't changed anything.  I'm not seeing any other options that look like that.<br />
<br />
Btw, grats SoE on making yet another expansion where even if you don't use the &quot;Improved graphics&quot; you experience a slowdown.  My top of the line PC is lagging in the bazaar again with all the shit turned off.  It didn't 2 weeks ago.  I'm sure it's all on my end of course, they've done nothing wrong.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah but I do.. I often read alot of crap when the loading please wait comes up.. like what just whacked me, for how much... guild crap I wasn't paying attention to... yeah i can read it once I zone... but now its 15 seconds of sitting looking at the splash page only... minor greivance at best... but annoying and just an unrequired change. <br />
<br />
We'll get over it though ;)<br />
<br />
besides, so far I have nothing else to complain about with OOW.. and well ya know ;)</div></div><hr />

Good morning Ice =)<br />
 <br />
This is actually an interim step towards something we plan on doing in the future that we feel will improve immersion while zoning.  Can you suffer through it for a bit?  Pretty please?<br />

So does running Purify on all your code as part of your build process.<br />
<br />
If thats their reasoning its pathetic and a kludge.<br />

I find the new load screen very annoying..I'm sorry if Brutul doesnt like that i dont like it .</div></div><hr />

Heh, then that explains why a good friend of mine never had memory leak issues with EQ until AFTER Omens came out. :)<br />
<br />
Last night just before he logged off, he had one instance of EQ taking up over 1.2gb of memory... with old textures and new graphics options off.<br />

It's also dependant on not having your character name start with &quot;A&quot; :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Suporma</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Ugh, gonna have to agree with Haass too. It's annoying with 2 corpses on top of each other for me, let alone the massive piles I create at times. The splash screen I'm kind of used to already. I suppose their future plans would probably include some kind of image of the zone that you're zoning into. Not a bad idea, unnessesary, but good for those that like eye candy.<br />
<br />
I don't really play EQ for eye candy, but I do have to admit to liking the new water graphics. I like being able to see the bottom of lakes and oceans, without having to skim the surface for a buggy glance. Now if only they'd make it so I can see while I'm IN the water...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Heh, then that explains why a good friend of mine never had memory leak issues with EQ until AFTER Omens came out.  <br />
<br />
Avallach do you even bother to read before quoting me?<br />
<br />
I quoted someone as saying &quot;it stops memory leaks&quot;; I then said in the CONTEXT of MY message that in this day and age developing code and checking code in for builds without running a commercial product such as Purify against it is just unacceptable (which will knock down 99pct of issues).<br />
<br />
For someone to state that they added the splash screen to avoid memory leaks (if true) would just validate that the QA of OOW and the engineering practices of SOE are a joke and I for one dearly hope that it is not so.  It sounds like based on your friends experience that it is indeed true.<br />
<br />
P.S. Heya Supes!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Sony said the splash screen on zone is a way to kill memory leaks and they put it up because what it does to the zone screen is just ugly as ass basically, and they plan to turn that splash screen into transistions to make a zone less of a still point... so you feel like your traveling instead of warping across the EK bridge (basically from all the PR jargon I think we will see little movies where the zones are.... like seeing ourselves move down the bridge in first person instead of warping across it)<br />
<br />
All and all I think it will just slow things down... my comment was more out of sarcasm about their excuses than a fact.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Vigdis SangCaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Really bad interim fix in any event. <br />
<br />
I also don't really care what I'm looking at while I zone, but I find the bright-as-fuck splash screen to be uber distracting and off-putting.</div></div><hr />
