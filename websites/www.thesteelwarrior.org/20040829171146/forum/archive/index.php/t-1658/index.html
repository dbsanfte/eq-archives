Things To Do In An Elevator<br />
1.When there's only one other person in the elevator, tap them on the shoulder and then pretend it wasn't you. <br />
2.Push the buttons and pretend they give you a shock. Smile, and go back for more.<br />
3.Ask if you can push the buttons for other people, but push the wrong ones. <br />
4.Call the Psychic Hotline from your cell phone and ask if they know what floor you're on. <br />
5.Hold the doors open and say you're waiting for your friend. After awhile, let the doors close and say, &quot;Hi Greg. How's your day been?&quot; <br />
6.Drop a pen and wait until someone reaches to help pick it up, then scream, &quot;That's mine!&quot; <br />
7.Bring a camera and take pictures of everyone in the elevator. <br />
8.Move your desk in to the elevator and whenever someone gets on, ask if they have an appointment. <br />
9.Lay down a Twister mat and ask people if they'd like to play. <br />
10.Leave a box in the corner, and when someone gets on ask them if they hear something ticking. <br />
11.Pretend you are a flight attendant and review emergency procedures and exit with the passengers. <br />
12.Ask, &quot;Did you feel that?&quot; <br />
13.Stand really close to someone, sniffing them occasionally. <br />
14.When the doors close, announce to the others, &quot;It's okay. Don't panic, they open up again.&quot; <br />
15.Swat at flies that don't exist. <br />
16.Tell people that you can see their aura. <br />
17.Call out, &quot;Group hug!&quot; then enforce it. <br />
18.Grimace painfully while smacking your forehead and muttering &quot;Shut up, all of you, just shut up!&quot; <br />
19.Crack open your briefcase or purse, and while peering inside, ask, &quot;Got enough air in there?&quot; <br />
20.Stand silently and motionless in the corner, facing the wall, without getting off.<br />
21.Stare at another passenger for a while, then announce in horror, &quot;You're one of THEM!&quot; and back away slowly. <br />
22.Wear a puppet on your hand and use it to talk to the other passengers. <br />
23.Listen to the elevator walls with your stethoscope. <br />
24.Make explosion noises when anyone presses a button. <br />
25.Grinning, stare at another passenger for a while, and then announce, &quot;I have new socks on.&quot; <br />
26.Draw a little square on the floor with chalk and announce to the other passengers, &quot;This is my personal space.&quot; <br />
27.Offer name tags to all the other passengers. Wear yours upside down. <br />
28.When the elevator reaches a floor, pretend you're struggling to open the door. And when it opens, by itself, play embarrassed. <br />
29.Murmur, &quot;Have to pee, have to pee&quot;, then say &quot;Oooppps!&quot; <br />
30.Scream out Geronimo every time the door opens. <br />
31.When everything is quiet, ask &quot;Who's cell phone is that?&quot;</div></div><hr />
