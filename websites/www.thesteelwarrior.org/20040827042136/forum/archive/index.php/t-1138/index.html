<br />
Whasup! Its Disdane's stolen Raid Guide!(thanks Aarth ) You don't have<br />
to reply to this or anything, but everyone MUST read through it. Reply<br />
if you feel you want to lend some vocal support, also for criticism or<br />
if you feel there's something that needs to be added/changed.<br />
<br />
Almost every Nihil raid is Nihil-only. There are times when we invite<br />
someone along, but that's rare.<br />
<br />
Read up and enjoy! Oh, and I hope you like strong language...<br />
<br />
The title says it all. If you don't like raiding, don't read this.<br />
<br />
First there are 4 Golden Rules which shall apply to every single raid<br />
you ever go on:<br />
<br />
1. Watch your chat Screen<br />
<br />
2. WATCH YOUR CHAT SCREEN<br />
<br />
3. WATCH YOUR FREAKIN' CHAT SCREEN!!!<br />
<br />
4. Raid commands are in the /rs channel. All other chatter is in the<br />
raid chat channel. Tells are used for individual buffs and group leaders<br />
are the only ones that request group buffs.<br />
<br />
I CANNOT stress this enough, people. Swivel your eyes so that they face<br />
the box which houses your chatter and WATCH IT. There is always ONE<br />
IDIOT who refuses to look at the chat screen, please do NOT be that<br />
person.<br />
<br />
<br />
Before the Raid<br />
<br />
- Arrive at the raid AT THE SCHEDULED TIME. If it says 2pm PST, find out<br />
  what this is under your own Time Zone and BE THERE at THAT TIME. DO<br />
NOT wait until this time to leave your exp. group and start looking for<br />
a port, you should have done that 1 hour prior to the start of the raid.<br />
<br />
- Find out where the raid is gathering at and get there, then plop your<br />
  butt down on the ground and WAIT. It will take some time to get<br />
organized and you can help this process immensely by parking your rear<br />
end and keeping your mouth shut.<br />
DO NOT take this time to duel half the raid.<br />
DO NOT take this time to show off your new, lame, spamfest hotkey.<br />
DO take this time to go to the bathroom, get a snack, tidy up your house<br />
or catch up on some homework for cryin' out loud.<br />
DO take this time to make and organize your raid hotkeys. Find out who<br />
the MA/SA are and prepare for them accordingly. This is the best time to<br />
do it before the raid begins, use it wisely.<br />
Please keep your chatter to a minimum while we are forming everything<br />
up. General chat is fine so long as it does not get out of hand. I<br />
understand that the time before a raid starts is boring and tedious, but<br />
it will only take longer if you ask silly questions such as: Are we<br />
ready to zone in yet? (Every 30 seconds)<br />
<br />
- Take this time to ensure the following:<br />
A. You have &quot;server-side filtering&quot; enabled. Type /serverside on&quot; to<br />
initiate this.<br />
B. You have adjusted your chat and graphics for &quot;Raid settings&quot; Turn off<br />
un-needed chat channels such as Damage Shields, as well as setting PC<br />
spells to &quot;Group only&quot;(or You only if you prefer, /shrug). Small tweaks<br />
like these can save you lots of heartache in LD's and general lag<br />
C. Type &quot;/assist off&quot;. DO IT. This will stop your auto attack from<br />
turning on when you /assist the MA, so you don't attack the target<br />
prematurely.<br />
D. Type &quot;/lootnodrop always.&quot; This will keep you from looting something<br />
on accident. Another tip is to put your mouse pointer overtop of the<br />
icon of the item and hold down the &quot;Alt&quot; key. This will bring up a text<br />
box telling you the name of the item.<br />
<br />
- The raid will be formed. Nihil is going to make the best out of this<br />
  new raid system so I highly suggest that you buy Planes of Power. We<br />
will not exclude you from a raid if you do not have PoP but your group<br />
may be rather small. If enough people are lacking the raid system then<br />
we will do a traditional raid without it, we will NOT, however, change<br />
around our entire raid system and screw everyone else out of raid exp<br />
just because YOU can't shell out 30 bucks. This should get better as<br />
time progresses and more people buy the expansion.<br />
<br />
- Groups will be formed and looter's will be designated. No, you can't<br />
  be a looter. Don't ask.<br />
<br />
- During this start-up time, buffs will be cast. Specific spells such as<br />
  Haste or Clarity will have designated casters responsible for keeping<br />
these on the whole raid. Find out who they are, then when you wish to<br />
receive a buff from them, SEND A TELL. That's right, you heard me, SEND<br />
A FROAKING TELL TO THE PERSON DOING THE BUFF, DO NOT ASK FOR IT IN<br />
GENERAL CHAT BECAUSE YOU WON'T GET IT! Using other means of<br />
communication (ie. /shout, /guild, /ooc) causes unneeded spam for<br />
everyone involved. Just send a tell.<br />
<br />
- Group spells like Blessing of Aegolism or Kodiak's Endless Intellect<br />
  are very mana-intensive and sometimes require expensive reagents to<br />
cast. For spells such as these you must NOT ask for them until you have<br />
a FULL group. If you have not been grouped yet do NOT ask for any<br />
group-spell. Once your group is FULL have the LEADER send a tell to the<br />
caster asking for the spell. This will maximize the spell's use and save<br />
loads of med-time in preparation for the raid.<br />
<br />
The Raid Begins<br />
<br />
I - Assisting the Tank<br />
<br />
Ok, so groups are now formed, people are buff, and the casters have good<br />
mana once again. Now for the fun part:<br />
<br />
- Figure your who your Main Assist is. The Main Assist is your GOD, he<br />
  is the one who decides what to attack and when to attack it. You DON'T<br />
attack a MoB unless he says its ok, his word is law.<br />
<br />
- Figure out who your Secondary Assist is. In the event that the MA<br />
  dies, go LD, is AFK for an extended period of time or else cannot<br />
perform his duties then the SA takes over. While the SA is in charge he<br />
has the full Rights of an MA and is expected to be treated as such.<br />
<br />
- When a MoB is pulled into the raid camp, they may sometimes stop to<br />
  cast a spell at the puller. DO NOT RUN OUT TO ATTACK THEM, WATCH YOUR<br />
CHAT SCREEN TO SEE WHAT IS GOING ON!!! YES, THE MOB WILL COME TO YOU, BE<br />
FREAKIN' PATIENT!!!<br />
<br />
- When a MoB comes into the Raid camp, the MA is FIRST to engage it.<br />
  This is done to build up the MA's aggression, the entire idea of an MA<br />
is to keep the MoB on one and ONLY one target during the course of the<br />
battle, this target is preferably the MA.<br />
<br />
- The MA shall call out to the entire raid that he has engaged the MoB<br />
  and is building up his aggro. Now is the proper time to /assist the MA<br />
(But make FREAKIN' SURE that you have typed &quot;/assist off&quot; prior to doing<br />
this!!!). Do NOT engage the MoB at this time.<br />
<br />
-Unless you are the MA: DO NOT TARGET MOBS WITH THE MOUSE!!! You should<br />
NEVER use the mouse to target a MoB because you WILL break a Mez! ONLY<br />
use /assist &lt;MA&gt;. ONLY!! ALWAYS!! If you don't know how to make hotkeys,<br />
ask someone.<br />
<br />
- When the MA has built up sufficient aggro they will call out to kill<br />
  the MoB. Each MA may have their own unique Kill message so be sure to<br />
figure out what is what among your MA's. DO NOT ATTACK THE MOB UNTIL THE<br />
MA CALLS IT!!! DO NOT THINK THAT JUST BECAUSE THE MA IS ATTACKING THAT<br />
YOU NEED TO BE AS WELL!!!<br />
<br />
- Once the MoB is dead, the King Looter from the group that got the kill<br />
  should immediately loot the corpse. If there is droppable loot, loot<br />
it. If something is no-drop, announce what it is, unless its some junk<br />
that we have told you to destroy beforehand.<br />
<br />
II - Aggression Management Guide (also called: &quot;Taunt Sucks&quot;)<br />
<br />
When we attack a normal MoB on a raid, the idea is to keep that MoB on<br />
the MA at all times. Complete Heal is very mana efficient when used on<br />
characters with a High HP level. Hence it is best if ONE tank with a lot<br />
of HP tanks the MoB for the entire fight, it is NOT mana efficient to<br />
Divine Light 9 or 10 peeps who can't control their aggro.<br />
<br />
Here is the Golden Rule for ALL Main Tank situations:<br />
<br />
IT IS NOT THE MA'S JOB TO HOLD ONTO AGGRO. EVERY SINGLE PERSON IN THE<br />
GAME CAN OUT-TAUNT THE MA. IT IS EVERYONE ELSE'S JOB TO MAKE SURE THE<br />
AGGRO STAYS ON THE MA<br />
<br />
Read that line. Now read it again. Copy it, print it, hang it right over<br />
your monitor where you can easily spot it. Above all: Worship it<br />
<br />
(Author's Note: The following insults apply only to the major raid<br />
proper, the ones doing most of the damage. They do NOT apply to the<br />
Healers, Slowers, Mezzers or Debuffing team, which typicaly take aggro<br />
only because they absolutely have to land those spells. Thank you and<br />
have a pleasant day)<br />
<br />
The premise is clear: The skill &quot;Taunt&quot; really, really SUCKS. This skill<br />
WILL NOT save your weak caster butt from the MoB man quadding you for<br />
300 . If you get aggro, do NOT say &quot;The MA needs to taunt more&quot; because<br />
the MA IS taunting, your own epic incompetence and failure to think<br />
properly has gotten you aggro (Yes, I detest aggro stealers) Now GET<br />
YOUR BUTT OUT OF IT. EVERY SINGLE CLASS should know by the time they are<br />
46 how to get something they don't want off of them. This is NOT done by<br />
spamming your &quot;Help, Beastiez is on 'da n00ker!&quot; hotkey and running in<br />
big circles around the camp. If its on you and it looks like its gonna<br />
stay that way for awhile, do everyone a favor and STAND STILL. If you<br />
die, you'll be rezzed, and the longer you stand there and let the melee<br />
beat on the baddie the faster it will be to that rez.<br />
<br />
Hopefully by now you have identified when to cast to avoid excessive<br />
aggro (if you are a caster) or how to ditch that aggro if you out-melee<br />
the MA (if you are a melee).<br />
<br />
For Nukers: Learn how to play your freakin' class and WAIT TO NUKE. You<br />
are NOT quad-kiting here! Your entire mana bar DOES NOT need to be<br />
inside the MoB within the first 5 seconds of combat. Wait until the MoB<br />
reaches 50% health, that is the accepted time to start nuking.<br />
<br />
For Melee: For Warriors, Paladins and Shadow Knights: If somehow you<br />
out-aggro the MA the best thing for you to do is STOP ATTACKING. Just<br />
turn off your auto attack and take a few steps back. NO, you are NOT<br />
cool because you got more aggro, you are merely a threat to the entire<br />
raid.<br />
<br />
For Rogues: If you haven't figured this one out by now... That's all I'm<br />
gonna say.<br />
<br />
For Monks: I play a monk. I read Monk discussion boards. I know this<br />
class well. Stealing aggro from the MA seems to be a &quot;Big Dick&quot; kind of<br />
thing among Monks. Apparently they seem to get a real rise out of it. If<br />
you are one of these monks, then you can take aggro once and log to go<br />
beat it off for the duration of the raid. YOU ARE NOT SPECIAL because<br />
you did more damage than the warrior. Turn off your &lt;expletive&gt;<br />
auto-attack and FD. I also understand that in some zones FD is bugged<br />
and this will not work properly. Under these circumstances please just<br />
stop attacking for the love of god and let the MA get his MoB back.<br />
<br />
For Rangers (Thank you, Fenia): Jolt jolt jolt jolt jolt. If you don't<br />
have this spell your entire life outside of raiding should consist of<br />
trying to get it. It's low enough level that you can reasonably be<br />
expected to be that level (51) and it's vendor sold. Weapons are also an<br />
issue. You're a dual wielding blender death machine in the eyes of<br />
mobs--never mind that you're being out damaged by the bard, they don't<br />
care. This means one thing--WOODSMAN'S STAFF. Or a better 2hb, but<br />
that's the old-school death weapon for rangers. Woodsman's Staff out<br />
damaged a surprising number of dual wield combinations, believe me, I've<br />
been in on tests. This is an uber enough weapon and generates FAR FAR<br />
less hate than just about any dual wield combination for comparable or<br />
better damage. If you're raiding, use this for Pete's sake. And if<br />
you're 54 , go hunt in Fungus Grove and get Jolting Blades. Remember,<br />
it's the lives of EVERYONE on the raid that depend on you not taking<br />
aggro, so don't.<br />
<br />
<br />
III - Additions<br />
<br />
Typically we will have more than one MoB enter the camp at once,<br />
hopefully these multiple MoBs will be mezzable and quickly subdued by<br />
the Enchanters, in which case the MA will Taunt and Kill one by one.<br />
Here are a few situations we may encounter that are contrary to this:<br />
<br />
- 2 Un-mezzable MoBs: In this case the MA and SA will both pick targets<br />
  to engage. Everyone will /assist the MA and kill his target while the<br />
SA sticks to the other target and tanks it until the first target is<br />
dead.<br />
<br />
- 1 Un-mezzable, rest are Mezzable: This situation may be MORE dangerous<br />
  than 2 un-mezzables. The real danger is not when the un-mezzable<br />
enters with the rest of the mezzable pull. The danger is when the<br />
Un-mezzable is either: A. Not known to be Un-mezzable until after the<br />
fight has started or B. Un-mezzable ADDS after the Kill has been called<br />
on another target.<br />
The danger in these situations is that the MA must SWITCH his target in<br />
order to kill the Un-mezzable MoB first. This often leads to mass<br />
confusion as people ARE NOT LOOKING AT THEIR CHAT thus breaking mezzes<br />
that are cast on the old target. PLEASE keep a watch on your chat at all<br />
times because there is the chance that a target will change! It happens<br />
rarely but I have seen first hand what it can do to raids when somebody<br />
is un-prepared. This sounds like a good time to reiterate the Three<br />
Golden Rules of a raid:<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------<br />
1. Watch your chat Screen<br />
<br />
2. WATCH YOUR CHAT SCREEN<br />
<br />
3. WATCH YOUR FREAKIN' CHAT SCREEN!!!<br />
------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
IV - Pets<br />
<br />
The bane of every raid is NOT, surprisingly enough, a Necro or Magi pet.<br />
Far from it, the pet is a wonderful little companion who does good<br />
damage and can expedite the killing process. He always knows where his<br />
target is and consequently does not waste time trying to find it, making<br />
him generally more efficient than your average Raid Melee. No, the TRUE<br />
bane of a raid is usually the person controlling that pet. If said necro<br />
or mage becomes lazy, sleepy, or other bad things, EVIL STUFF HAPPENS.<br />
Here are some tips to keep in your mind when you decide to whip out the<br />
pet:<br />
<br />
Thank you, Zalgyr for the pet eddicate<br />
<br />
- If I say &quot;No Pets&quot; I mean it.<br />
<br />
- Arrange your /pet guard point away from where the fighting will occur.<br />
<br />
- Whenever an add enters the camp, BACK YOUR PET OFF until the mob is<br />
  either being tanked or is mesmerized. this prevents the nasty<br />
occurrence known as caster independent target switching. Once the add is<br />
dealt with, THEN /assist the MA and have your pet reenter the battle.<br />
Pet control is critical, and poor pet control usually results in a dead<br />
enchanter.<br />
<br />
- I highly recommend that everyone get an insta-kill pet item, such as<br />
  (for mages) earthen boots, because those, when hotkeyed, enable you to<br />
get rid of your pet quickly and efficiently. /pet get lost is NOT<br />
sufficient. It has a limited radius, and if your pet does bad things,<br />
the odds are good it will be out of your control.<br />
<br />
- Is there a mob running away low on health? back your pet off. PCs are<br />
  sufficient, and pets chasing run the risk of getting aggroed onto mobs<br />
along the way back, since their return speed is so slow. The last thing<br />
a raid needs is a pet tanking an add somewhere far away.<br />
<br />
- I have a hotkey. It looks something like this:<br />
------------------------------------------------------------<br />
/gu KILL ALL PETS NOW!! THIS IS A F*CKING ORDER!!!<br />
/gu KILL ALL PETS NOW!! THIS IS A F*CKING ORDER!!!<br />
/gu KILL ALL PETS NOW!! THIS IS A F*CKING ORDER!!!<br />
------------------------------------------------------------<br />
That WILL be spammed when pets are to die.<br />
When you see this hotkey, it means somebody's pet is doing something<br />
wrong and totally screwing up the raid. DO NOT take the time to figure<br />
out if this applies to your pet or not, because it DOES! If this is<br />
called, it is an ORDER, you KILL YOUR PET NOW!!! It doesn't matter if<br />
you glance over to see YOUR pet calmly killing the correct MoB, you KILL<br />
IT ANYWAYS.<br />
<br />
- Remember - if you see something strange, back the pet off. If targets<br />
  are switched, back pet off. If something enters the camp, back pet<br />
off. When in any doubt as to if your pet has aggroed something, KILL IT.<br />
As a pet caster, this is your responsibility to the raid. Without<br />
extreme caution and attention by the caster, pets are more dangerous<br />
than boss mobs. When going AFK, KILL YOUR PET. i don't give a flying<br />
f*ck if its only for 30 seconds. And also - when AFK, FD or stand up.<br />
<br />
V - Running a smooth Raid<br />
<br />
Things behave differently when you're on a raid. These rules will help<br />
to make sure we have a smooth a raid as can possibly be.<br />
<br />
--- Sitting: MoBs LOOOOOVE when you sit down, especially planer MoBs.<br />
After a pull a MoB will typically make a beeline for the first medding<br />
caster it sees and knock the daylights out of him, only to turn just as<br />
fast towards the next hapless caster. This initial &quot;ping-pong&quot; of the<br />
MoB from player to player is a HUGE setback at the start of the fight.<br />
The MA is running around like a headless chicken while the casters take<br />
some hefty damage. Nothing is getting accomplished and it all becomes a<br />
big pain in the rear. Read the following:<br />
<br />
- If you've just cast a &quot;big&quot; spell, be it nuke or major heal, stand up<br />
  for a few seconds to let your aggro fade away. The MoBs just love to<br />
enact revenge when you plunker your fanny down to med right after<br />
blasting the bejeezus out of them. I'm sure you all know the limits of<br />
your spells as far as aggro is concerned. If you don't, LEARN THEM<br />
<br />
- When the &quot;Incoming&quot; message is called, STAND UP. I don't care what<br />
  your mana bar looks like, its only for a few seconds but it will save<br />
HUGE heartache in getting the MA on the MoB. Once the MA starts<br />
taunting, you can safely sit down<br />
<br />
- If you go AFK (and its not a safe area during a designated med break),<br />
  STAND THE HELL UP!! DO IT!! Once again, I don't CARE what your mana<br />
bar looks like. Get a Mod Rod if its so damn important.<br />
<br />
--- Moving: During most raids (except for the really boring ones) we<br />
will move from location to location. Moving 20-30 people safely from<br />
Point A to Point B is fun, you never know quite how its going to turn<br />
out leaving all kinds of room for opportunity to rear its ugly head.<br />
Read up:<br />
<br />
- People need to go AFK during raids, that's a given. Hence about 5 or<br />
  so minutes before we move we will instruct you to hold all AFKs. No<br />
soda trips, no bathroom calls, no running from a burning building,<br />
NOTHING. At this time please remind us if anyone is currently LD.<br />
<br />
- The lag monster silently creeps in the shadows. He's a crafty one,<br />
  that lag monster, he'll wait for JUST this time to make his move. If<br />
you are the lucky one who falls victim to the lag monster's clutches and<br />
are either left behind or else become stuck in the middle of a move:<br />
STOP MOVING. Unless you are absolutely, positively sure of where you are<br />
going and there is absolutely, positively no doubt in your mind that<br />
NOTHING could train after you there: DON'T MOVE. If you get stranded and<br />
its a dangerous run or you're lost: Just stop. If something attacks you:<br />
Die (or solo it for mad exp, /shrug). We'll find you, we'll drag you,<br />
we'll get you rezzed. If you know you're gonna die, do us a favor and<br />
get a /loc to help us find your corpse. A good explanation of your<br />
surroundings couldn't hurt, either.<br />
<br />
--- Loot: When a MoB goes down, they will sometimes have something shiny<br />
for you to take home to Ma!! Most of the time they will just have loot,<br />
though. Some of the times they have loot they will have...... GOOD<br />
LOOT!!<br />
<br />
- Good Loot (also called Ph4t L3Wtz, or Uber Loot) is always MERITED<br />
  under Nihil. You help the guild, and we'll help you. Guess what?<br />
Sometimes you simply won't get anything on a raid. Live with that, it'll<br />
come back to you.<br />
<br />
- If somebody gets something that you wanted as well, CONGRATULATE that<br />
  person. No, don't sulk or cry about it. How would YOU feel if YOU got<br />
an item and someone else started bad-mouthing you? If, however, you<br />
honestly feel that you SHOULD have been merited that particular item,<br />
please feel free to send a tell to one of the officers on the raid with<br />
your concerns. Sometimes we'll have very close decisions about loot on a<br />
raid between two people, its not easy but in the end we have to pick<br />
only ONE to receive the item.<br />
<br />
- Disdanes e-mail {deleted}<br />
<br />
- You've just screwed up. You accidently targeted the wrong MoB and<br />
  cracked a Mez. Maybe you just looted a MoB and weren't supposed to?<br />
Whatever the case, you have screwed up. Now people are angry and Aartheb<br />
is spamming the screen with the capslock again, all you want to do is<br />
crawl into some dark corner and hope nobody sees you. So what do you do<br />
now? Just come right out and admit your mistake, then say &quot;I'm sorry, I<br />
just broke mez, etc.&quot; Guess what? We WON'T boot you from the raid and we<br />
WON'T ride your ass for the rest of your life. What will we do? We'll<br />
get over it and get back on with the raid, because we know more than<br />
anyone that sh*t happens. We make mistakes and we're human (most of us).<br />
So please, if you find that you've done something wrong, just admit it<br />
and apologize, its the best thing you can do for yourself and the raid.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">zero deaths.... but I swear mobs wait for when I'm typing for the channel then enrage when I'm half way through the sentance.  I usually just turn to the side and suffer with the &quot;cannot see your target&quot; spam.  And I think twice I haven't noticed enrage but lived even with attacking through.  The channel is worth it though =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Smakz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">heh, have to agree shik, but its usually<br />

/list<br />
1 myguildsraidchannel, 2 serverwide.thesteelwarrior, 3 MSC (our cleric rotation channel)<br />
<br />
/leave 2<br />

i tend to die more on raids from posting useless links, and talking about gnoll whips than anything else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Dumptimax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">hehe, on that post it tells people to use serverfilter (command removed from game), and to use &quot;/lootnodrop always&quot; so they dont accidentally loot things (always is default, never would prevent looting)  At the bottom of post it says if theres any errors to post there, and when i did instead of fixing their mistakes they just deleted my post.  :lol<br />
go you!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Just typed /lootnodrop always in game.  Message says: &quot;New Setting: Always display loot requestor for no drop items.&quot;  So they are correct with that.  And it doesn't prevent looting, all it does is gives you a pop up box asking if you are sure you want to loot a no drop item.  As for serverfilter, a few things on the post are a bit dated, but it's still one of the best posts I have seen about raid rules.</div></div><hr />
