<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kadah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">These are my thought's<br />
Please dont rant or rave, I would like constructive cristicism seeing that Sony wants to either nerf Ikkinz Trials or give knights some sort of warrior defensive.<br />
<br />
The problem with giving knights defensive is that the scales will have to be rebalanced in favor of warriors afterwards, due to their primary core discipline being whored out. <br />
<br />
Thats when develpers have to start finding things to give warriors that will again make people cry unfair. If Paladins do recieve defensive in any way they will be able to replace warriors in guilds by tanking everything a warrior &quot;SHOULD&quot;.<br />
<br />
At the point of a knight defensive there will be nothing seperating shadowknights / paladins however the spellbook ability the two classes have will give great bounds over warriors whom are unable to justify themselves as a dps or a tank class.<br />
<br />
I say unable to justify as a tank class due to. The one raid ability &quot;Defensive&quot; is no longer their class defining skill, hybrids would have access to it as well. &quot;Defensive&quot; to knights would allow MANY guilds to suddenly have a huge power increase due to multiple tanks able to /disc defensive.<br />
<br />
Guilds would no longer themselves be balanced, After all every hybrid with the defensive skill on (usally 3x more hybrid plate then war on at any time) would be able to raid more often, And go to places the guild itself wouldnt have been able to do without a bastardized defensive.<br />
<br />
Warriors would then have to call for a reason to be a justifable class, And have to enroach upon rogue / monk / ranger dps by needing to output massive damage to compensate for loss of defensive means. <br />
<br />
In retrospect giving plate hybrids lets say a 65 only disc to allow for 40% less damage taken for 3 minutes with say a 12 minute refresh, To compensate warriors would need damage bonus placed on main hand  and offhand. Be given a disc that increases DB Main hand / off hand by 40% and two handed weapons by 65% for 3 minutes with a refresh of 12 minutes. <br />
<br />
If Plate hybrids were agreeable to said disc's thus giving warriors a new focus , as a damage absortion / dealer then yes something I think could be reworked, However do not think that Plate hybrids can enroach upon the parent class, without the parent class recieving something in return</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's rumored that SoE will be making a Knight tuned version of the boss mobs for the trials and that the normal version will spawn should a Warrior enter the zone.<br />
<br />
While this doesn't guarantee Knights won't get a &quot;burst mitigation&quot; ability, it's pretty darned close to it.<br />
<br />
IMO most Warriors don't want Knights to get Defensive or even a part of it. Receiving their entire spellbooks in trade for many of us would not be a &quot;good deal&quot;. Defensive is not for sale.<br />

Defensive is not for sale. <br />
<br />
could not agree more.<br />
<br />
my job is to tank, not to dps, i frankly care shit about my dps.<br />
<br />
if soe would give even a lower defensive disc to knights then what do we have left ? if we get more dps, rogues and monks will cry in raids (hasn't it been already parsed that a warrior with fellstrike outdps most monks ?)<br />
<br />
of course a knight with def would trivialise some fights for many guilds (mine :p). <br />
ex : we are a AoW-level guild, meaning we can still wipe on it with our common raid force (30-40 peeps)<br />
usually MT down = wipe (not always)<br />
with a knight as a MT2, that can grab more reliably agro quickly + defensive that would be no problem at all :/<br />
and the other wars would be out of MT rotation as well...<br />
<br />
come on guys... we just have defensive. warrior = defensive. we are not here to dps, just to take the hits... LEAVE OUR GOD DAMN 4 YEAR OLD DISC ALONE !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kadah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I completely understand defensive not being for sale.<br />
However, it seems from reading that SoE is determined to give plate hybrids 25% mitigation (or something around that) whenever they enter the ikkinz grounds, Not only for themselves but for THEIR ENTIRE GROUP.<br />
<br />
If SoE dosent see how fucking unbalancing that is, that people will walk trials and that our role in it, Will be substantially reduced due to lazy people wanting access to the easier trials then we obviously deserve something in return when doing the trials.<br />
<br />
Why not if knights get mobs that hit for 25% less , Why dont warriors when we go in get mobs with 25% less hp, or let our group do 25% more damage. <br />
As I said, when they give abilities or even bonuses that enroach upon our abilities , then they have to repay us with something to keep our competitive edge or else we will again loose value for GoD trials.<br />
<br />
Thus they are robing Peter, to pay Paul. no matter how many ways you cut it.  So if they do in fact make mobs hit for 25% less so that knights have a &quot;defensive&quot; skill up at all time for their entire party, then we deserve an aggresive skill for our entire party without the negative affects of taking more damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Korinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I dont know what they could possibly give warriors to balance a knights defensive. Give us greater dps isnt going to take way from the fact that entire group will be fighting mobs that do less damage. <br />
<br />
Increasing dps for warriors and soon monks, rangers, rogues are complaining that we are too close to them, then they will have to be fixed, then casters will complain yadda yadda...<br />
<br />
Warriors often die in these trials then the named starts on the rest of your party, with the new pally nerf to mobs your group members now have a greater chance of surviving without a warrior. Why would anyone group a warrior to tank them (warriors being the primary tank mind you) when its so much safer and easier to bring a knight?<br />
<br />
Someone said on another post that SoE guys at the fanfare said knights will never get a defensive disc  but as i see it they did just that with the supposed &quot;fix&quot;<br />
<br />
Knight classes definatley need a hand with GoD but this is not it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>arbosch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Special instances will place you guys on the botton of the tanklist.<br />
<br />
If a knight can tank it. A ranger/monk can tank the mob to.<br />
<br />
So if the groupe is Warrior, Monk, Cleric, Druid, Enchanter, Wizzard.<br />
And the groupe is Knight, Monk, Cleric, Druid, Enchanter, Wizzard.<br />
<br />
First groupe will die the moment the warrior die.<br />
Second groupe will be able to let the monk tank when the knight die.<br />
<br />
This create way more troubles then it solve. You guys should see that defensiv like disciplines need to get balanced between the classes or they need to get nerfed that they dont have any real effect so the classes are balanceable.<br />
<br />
You guys destroy your owne class with not let them balance disciplines. Defensiv, ripost disciplines are way to powerfull when you meet mobs which hit for more then 2000 and you have tankclasses with them and one without them. Special in a groupe situation.<br />
<br />
Let you have a new discipline. ShieldProtecting which absorb 30% direct melee damage from all groupemembers. Let knights have a 30% selfonly defensiv discipline and warriors get a groupeversion defensiv discipline which eat the endurance from the groupe. The new discipline will help you in situation where knights are usually good. When there are many adds warriors give the groupe more protection and counter the utility we have (Healing, pulling, rooting etc.). You have to share the effect defensiv have. The question is only how they will call it and how they will make it. Special instance version is the worst possible way if you ask me.<br />

<br />
You're right, if a Knight can tank it then Rangers, Monks, and Beastlords can tank it. Obviously the correct fix was no fix at all. High level Knights could and did tank it. That encouraged others like yourself to think you should tank it too. Since y'all were too gimp to tank it, why then it must be broken and unfair! SoE should have promptly put up a message upon entry, &quot;If you fail at this, then you weren't ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
That Shield Protecting idea is perfect for the group support nature of Paladins. Paladins aren't Warriors and they shouldn't tank like or have the role of Warriors. Let Paladins buff the group, wave heal the group, and take damage for the group. Perfect Arbosch, absolutely perfect - y'all have a role, group support.<br />
<br />
Devensive is and will continue to be a sole Warrior capability. You can stop campaigning now Arbosch. You won't be getting Defensive and Warriors will not be losing it.<br />
<br />
Balance does not mean Paladins tank like Warriors.<br />

While 10K HP's is pretty nice, we aren't talking Warrior even without Defensive.<br />
<br />
You don't get &quot;-1 DI&quot;, your stuns don't mitigate, and your heals don't help.<br />
<br />
EQRankings, which is never up to date, has me as the #7 Wariror on my server.<br />
<br />
I have almost 12K HP's buffed, &quot;-1 DI&quot;, etc. and I can add perhaps another 100-200HP's without another equipment upgrade.<br />
<br />
Even without Defensive, Paladins are not Warriors. Get it? Versus an unstunable high DI mob you aren't The Tank. Concidering that Defensive is used almost exclusively on high DI mobs it only adds to an already existing Warrior advantage that you can't match.<br />
<br />
Tanking high DI mobs is the Warrior specialized role.<br />
<br />
In this arena, you are perhaps #2. IMO that's the &quot;cost&quot; of your spellbook. You have a different tanking role than Warriors.<br />

sorry... i'm just sick of those pallies whining about our their tanking suck.<br />
it does not ! it is just different !<br />
<br />
paladins listen to me : YOU ARE NOT WARRIORS ! YOU WANT DEFENSIVE : REROLL !<br />
<br />
you are tanks, right. you've never been meant to tank as well as warriors. as warriors were never meant to cast spells.<br />
<br />
give up your caster side and become a warrior, stop being a sissy whiny casting paladin if you want defensive then</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I'm the one in favor of not what Kadah recommends at all, 40% is WAY WAY WAY too much, but 25%, with significant penalties of their own, with both DPS reduction, as well as spell haste reduction, and a 40 min refresh.<br />
<br />
He's also right that they will be getting that (probably more) without having it cost anything in terms of mana or endurance, and furthermore every member of their group got that as well.  On top of that there's no &quot;refresh&quot; or limitation, it's full time.   <br />
<br />
If I'm not mistaken, there were 3 people who I can recal who advocated knights actually getting defensive.  Those three were Graal, Kether, and Soledragondead.   The third one is not taken seriously by anyone, and while Graal and Kether both are asking for too much, they're both respectable, and quite intelligent.   I happen not to agree with them, as I don't think that knights should get anywhere above 25%, but let's look at my proposal vs. the current one.  Ask yourself *honestly* which one is worse for warriors.<br />
<br />
My idea<br />
<br />
3 minute discipline<br />
25% mitigation bonus<br />
35% damage output reduction<br />
25% spell haste reduction (this increases the chances of being interrupted while casting)<br />
40 minute refresh<br />
Endurance Based<br />
(Special note:  Available only as a drop in a regular trial, to prevent it from being &quot;farmed&quot; by pre-time guilds/knights)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
SoE's idea:<br />
<br />
X % mitigation bonus for tank(actual number not worked out)<br />
X % mitigation bonus for all other party members (essentially 5 person simultaneous /shield without taking the damage recourse of /shield)<br />
No damage reduction<br />
No spell haste reduction<br />
Full Time<br />
No Refresh timer<br />
No Cost<br />
Not needed to be activated<br />
<br />
<br />
Furthermore, it doesn't address a large portion of where the problems occur (Kod single group nameds, Uqua raid offtanking) which will now ALSO have to be addressed, it makes Kod FAR easier to get into where people can get all sorts of time quality gear and augs without consuming appropriate content.<br />
<br />
Looking at the alternative, my little idea doesn't look so bad after all.<br />
<br />
Also, I got no issue with getting an Aggressive boost as compensation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">SoE's idea:<br />
Create a Knight version of the trial and make the success rate as close as posible to the Warrior trial sucess rate. Defensive is a Warrior defining ability and it will not be shared.<br />

Please listen to me Paladin and Shadow Knights, what part of YOU ARE NOT A GD WARRIOR <br />
do you NOT understand???  We have had our Defensive disc for 4 years, why havent you whined about it before?  So what if you cant tank 3 specialized progression trials, DEAL <br />
WITH IT.  You are not a warrior, so if you want the Hps of one and the ability to tank like<br />
one then go and Roll one up.  We arent as powerful as you might think.<br />
<br />
I have been playing my Warrior for about 3 1/2 years (Been playing the game for 4 1/2)<br />
I love the play style a warrior offers and I enjoy the thrill of being a warrior.  You dont need<br />
Defensive, you need to realize if you want something, you have to give up something else <br />
in order to obtain said want.  I think you Hybrids need to grow up and realize this isnt UO <br />
or any other game you can be a GOD cause you can do everything.  I am a Warrior, I tank<br />
that's it. I suck at Dps, I cant root park, I cant stun, I can ONLY tank.  If they give Pallys or<br />
SKs defensive,  I will quit a game I truly love to play.  <br />
<br />
Flame if you want, I really dont care. I am entitled to my opinion.  I have the heart of a <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kadah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I can agree with you Frodlin,<br />
My idea was just given for a point perspective. However if they give their groups 25% increased mitigation for plate hybrid tanks, Then they should respond to warriors with a 25% aggresive-esque for anyone who groups with warriors (the benefit not affecting casters just melee) <br />
<br />
As long as they are willing to give something in which they can effectively balance both classes. Simply giving knights mini defensive for their entire group is not defensive. It puts us all back to sqare one. <br />
<br />
As i said, You cant balance anything effectively by giving knights a higher CONTINUOUS bonus then their parent class or you have effectively killed the parent class.<br />

There's what's known about it thus far. He appears to imply that it's not going to be easier and that it will be different.<br />
<br />
Now IF you want something that may actually have a chance to happen, here yas go:<br />
<br />
Unlike Warriors, every other class including Knights get to decide which encounter they want to do. Without a doubt if the encounters are different, some may be discernably easier or &quot;better&quot; to do with certain classes in your group.<br />
<br />
Every other class gets to choose.<br />
<br />
There, feel better? Something likely to actually occur that you can assume the worst about.<br />
<br />
As I said when this whole thing started. Knights can get through the trials. There was no need to do much of anything to them. But nooooooo, someone had to pander to their Defensive lust and feed their false hopes 8(.<br />
<br />
There yas go Frodlin, some ammo for yas. In this case Warriors are being shortchanged. Pretend it's Paladins.<br />
<br />
(the obvious fix is to have different desireable loot drop in each one but also randomly a 40HP Warrior only aug in the Warrior ones and a 20HP/20Mana Knight only aug in the Knight trials or something equally vacuous)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I don't understand what is so difficult about this.  If SoE thinks that knights should be able to tank the trials they should scale down the difficulty of the trials so that knights can tank them.  They shouldn't be doing any bs like making the trials easier for groups with knights, if they are going to make the trials easier then make them easier for everyone.<br />
<br />
If they want knights to be able to tank any mob than is single groupable, then don't put mobs in single group situations that knights cannot tank, and especially don't make single group encounters that are required for progression that require warriors to tank.<br />
<br />
Just nerf the freaking trials for everyone and get it over with.  Leave knights and warriors as is, we are currently pretty close to being balanced, stop screwing with the classes and fix the content.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Mathas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">We have had our Defensive disc for 4 years, why havent you whined about it before? <br />
While I'm not necessarily in favor of knights getting defensive, I'd imagine it's just now being brought up(seriously, at least) because this is the first time that there has been single-group content that 2/3rds of the tank classes in EQ cannot reliably tank with sufficient gear and appopriate healing.  Yes, a few have done it.  It's far from reliable, however.<br />
<br />
It's probably also being brought up now out of fear of future zones, both in this expansion and expansions to come.  If single-group content this early in GoD is this difficult for knights to tank, how are they possibly going to survive in the later zones of the expansion?  Or future expansions?  Keep in mind I'm talking solely about single-group content here.<br />
<br />
No matter how much some warriors might pound on their chests and grunt out &quot;ME SUPREME TANK,&quot; knights are tanks.  It's quite possible for a knight to be an acceptable tank in six-person situations and still have warriors be better.  But if knights, and/or the people they rely on for groups, don't feel they are adequate tanks, complaints will be raised.  Warriors certianly did their fair share of &quot;whining&quot; when the aggro discrepancy was too high.<br />
<br />
It's a sticky situation.  Every alternative or solution I can think of(including changing nothing) is bad in one way or another.  I really don't know what they should have done, and I certainly don't think they should mess with Vxed and Tipt, but I'll wait and see how it all turns out before I get too critical.<br />
<br />
<br />
Warrior's still are crap for aggro compared to knights. I'd rather them fix that disparity before moving on to knights.<br />
Not at the high-end, not anymore at least.  Snap aggro is usually faster for a knight, but for sustained aggro over time, warriors are doing great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Kadah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">My idea my Chummy pal. is this <br />
Take a plate hybrid into GoD trials. and they will supposedly recieve a 25% group shield effect. aka a defense increase<br />
So if you pick a warrior the group should instead recieve a aggresive 25% damage bonus while in said trial. <br />
just to keep things all nice and balanced.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Gobsmash Emgood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">The issues with GoD for knights start a lot sooner than the few trials that many are talking about.<br />
<br />
The trials starting with the sewers were designed IMHO to start with people geared with bazzar level gear, knights with much less than elemental have a very slim chance of finishing the trials.<br />
<br />
Yes I know we have had defensive a very long time (not that that fact matters) but for just as long the expected damage diffrance for a knight to a warrior has NEVER been as large as it is now in GoD. GoD did not add a progressive step allowing the 3 tanking classes to take care of things in there own way, it caused such a dramatic shift in power as to render all other tanks obsolet.<br />
<br />
Any defensive type dis that knights get must be balanced by it's negetive effects.<br />
<br />
<br />
 20% damage mitigation (40% of what a warrior gets) or 400 off of a hit for 2k<br />
 moderatly high END usage<br />
 50% reduction to all agro generated from cast spells not includeing procs or melee generated agro.<br />
 20-25 min dis timer<br />
 useable in any zone<br />
 drops in GoD but not nessarly in Kod + trials<br />
 <br />
<br />
With it knights are on even footing for agro but a lesser one for damage warriors remain as the perfered tanks if available for raids and most groups while allowing knights the chance to tank the trials (with difficulty). Also the trials do not need to be made any easyer allowing lower level people in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Kadah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Gobs, what will warriors get in return for this ability?<br />

Thats the point of this thread. Anyone can give the knights a defensive they can get behind, Now give warriors something in return that we can get behind.<br />
<br />
<br />
the problem therein lies in the fact that warriors aren't having any problems passing these trials, knights are.<br />
<br />
as someone said at the fan fair about balance, you can't take 2 classes that are out of balance, improve both classes, and expect them to balance out.<br />
<br />
when warriors got thier agro improvements, did knights get a tanking improvement to balance it out? no, and for obvious reasons.<br />

as someone said at the fan fair about balance, you can't take 2 classes that are out of balance, improve both classes, and expect them to balance out.<br />

when warriors got thier agro improvements, did knights get a tanking improvement to balance it out? no, and for obvious reasons.<br />

<br />
Personally I wish they would just take defensive out of the game, or severely nerf it, and give 'tanks' an innate mitigation percentage (warriors with the highest percentage obviously) and then balance from there, defensive has crippled our class since the day we recieved disciplines, but thats been said many times before and it hasnt happened heh. Warriors should never be hit as hard as a knight and a knight should never be hit as hard as any other class imo, innate mitigation is the only way to achieve that.<br />
<br />
Overall I think warriors and knights are balanced relatively well atm and its sad a small percentage of content is skewing the image.<br />
<br />
I also think people are crying wolf and/or gloating way to early, theres no way sony is going to make every member of a group take less damage just as long as a knight is tanking and not a warrior, thats asinine.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>arbosch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I dont really want defenisv. But the only way to balance the class is to balance defensiv like disciplines to. Defensiv like discipline was never as powerfull as they are now. On a mob which hit for 2000 defensiv is more powerfull then on a mob which hit for 100. The problem in GoD with defensiv like disciplines is, that mobs got to strong. Now defensiv are to powerfull to balance classes with it and classes without it. And this problem will only increase as stronger the mobs get. This is the mainproblem and noone here posted an answer how you can balance defensiv like disciplines in futur when the mobs get stronger and stronger. It is allready at tier2 in GoD a problem and will be way bigger problem at tier3 and at tier4. We dont want to be as good as warriors as tank. We only want be tanks and be able to tank mobs in a groupe situation. The only way to make this is to give us something which has the same effect as defensiv. On the other way everything which is a challenge for a 12000hp knight will be easy doable for a 9000hps warrior in defensiv. Something whic is a challenge for a 12000hps warrior+defensiv will be undoable for a knight etc.<br />
<br />
Tell me how you will balance the 'scale up in power as stronger the mob gets' from defensiv like disciplines? The moment you tell me a way to balance it without giving us something which has the same effect i will agree with you. But dont come up with healing etc. If you touch our healing the healer classes will cry that we step on there feets etc. and healing dont help us to tank better. It have to be something which make us better tanks so we can tank single groupe mobs. Not as good as warrior but we have to be able to tank mobs in single groups.<br />

If they want knights to be able to tank any mob than is single groupable, then don't put mobs in single group situations that knights cannot tank, and especially don't make single group encounters that are required for progression that require warriors to tank.<br />

Thats what I want and have said so a few times before.  I went and did a sewer trial the other day.  I am in a elemental guild but due to my lack of raid time and still in mostly ornate.  I was able to tank all the non named relatively easy, but when we got to the named (ancient stonemite) he made me his bitch.  /def would have helped, but weaponsheild would have made a much bigger difference.<br />
<br />
My main concern is that if you give a weaponsheild disc to knights (goign on SK's here not pally's), there needs to be something that would stop the use of offensive disc's for a short time.  Other wise you would have a SK thats immune to dmg for 18-24 seconds and then BANG dropping the HT bomb for 8k+ dmg.  Or the other way around by leading off w/ HT.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Knights and warriors are marginally balanced in every expansion but one, that being the current one, where the majority of most upper end guild's playtime is focused.<br />
<br />
We knights didng get defensive &quot;for obvious reasons&quot; but that comes from the same group of people who assure us everything is balanced, they just happened to not have a clue what they were doing when they created this expansion, and so have to retune every encounter, starting with instanced zones.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Imho, Balance is good as it is... Of course, some small readjustments could be done, but no big things...<br />

<br />
The actual problem is... time geared knight - max of 20-30% chance to win.  Sub full elemental equipped warrior - much more than that... as long as defensive is up.<br />
<br />
Thats the major issue.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And how exactly, would you propose knights to &quot;use their spellbook&quot; to tank, when our stuns dont work on greater than half the mobs in the expansion,  root is exceptionally dagerous (go try it ^^), and our heals generally dont do a damn thing?<br />
<br />
I keep hearing &quot;use ur spelbokz omg&quot;, but it seems the people who say that have never actually seen the contents of a knights spellbook...<br />
<br />
<br />
And &quot;hybrid&quot; which we generally stopped being in velious, doesnt mean &quot;cant tank shit&quot;, it means &quot;different than&quot; in this case.<br />

Currently, &quot;different than&quot; means &quot;dont even bother, there is no point&quot;<br />

SoE has admitted this content (apparently we are extending this to all high DI mobs, of which, a green con in natimbi has a higher DI than all but several mobs pre PoP, but we have to overlook this or it points out glaring inconsistencies in the argument) is supposed to be tanked by knights... they just messed up implementation.<br />
<br />
Keep thinking that knights arent supposed to tank &quot;high DI&quot; mobs.  I do it all the time. There is a huge difference in the mobs that knights are having issues tanking and &quot;high di&quot; mobs. And no, its not &quot;high di raid mobs&quot; as these arent raids, &quot;high di progression mobs&quot;, as there are high di progression mobs we can tank, or &quot;high di fillintheblank&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Err, knights have taunt, so do warriors.  Knights have stuns / aggro casts, warriors have incite, which is more effective off the box than a single stun / hate spell, and takes 0 time to cast.  Warriors have aetaunt, knights have... nothing?  Warriors can proc a +hate or +dps/hate proc up to 13 times a minute, knights can proc ~5-6 (im averaging something 5.425... with vanazir + ykesha and 5.6025 with hopebringer + lifetap proc [both with pious might, which is the red headed step child of the buff procs])<br />

 Shadow - I don't particularly mind the idea of Knights being able to drop HT or what have you as this thing is running, simply because I don't see it as being game breaking.

<br />
Paladin &quot;stun mitigation&quot; was retired by SoE and never replaced. While &quot;stun mitigation&quot; lengthens fights it spaces out the damage recieved and improves a Paladin's chances of survival.<br />
<br />
The closest thing Paladins get to burst mitigation/damage avoidance is DA, which prohibits them from doing damange, casting spells, and MTing/Add tanking.<br />
<br />
Paladin heals are not effective, especially when they are being hit.<br />
<br />
The closest thing SK's get to burst mitigation/damage avoidance is FD, which prohibits them from doing damange, casting spells, and MTing/Add tanking.<br />
<br />
Shadow Knight lifetaps are even worse than Paladin heals for alowing an SK to assist in keeping himself alive.<br />
<br />
SK DPS while it can shorten a fight and thereby increase their chances of survival it not best generated while they are MTing and being hit.<br />
<br />
Neither Paladins nor SK's have the kind of passive mitigation or avoidance that insures they are prefered to Rangers, Monks, and Beastlords in most tanking situations.<br />
<br />
All off these problems are inter-related. IMO it is a very bad thing to discuss one facet, like &quot;burst mitigation&quot; in isolation. It can't be clear what kind and how much &quot;burst mitigation&quot; Knights should have without concidering the other issues.<br />

<br />
Partha and Fitemore, Barraind provided a quote so that you'd have the opportunity to see the context in which the quote was in response to.   I'll repeat it here so there's no misunderstanding.<br />
<br />
with a knight as a MT2, that can grab more reliably agro quickly + defensive that would be no problem at all :/<br />
and the other wars would be out of MT rotation as well... <br />
<br />
The specific statement what that a knight could take over MT2 position due to aggro.   In my wildest dreams could such an incorrect statement be made.   AE taunt destroys this argument every way to Sunday.   It is literally impossible for a knight to compete with AE taunt unless it's bugged and doesn't work.    AE taunt followed by incite with /disc furious and then full defensive is of such a huge power increase over &quot;Build stun aggro and hit half defensive&quot; that there's no intelligent group of players who would choose the 2nd option.<br />
<br />
His response to that wasn't real good, since they DO have a fairly dramatic advantage on initial aggro, regardless of the &quot;instant&quot; nature of incite.   The only position of tanking that is &quot;threatened&quot; is the #1 position.  #2 and so on, it would take choosing a knight over a drunken, retarded, unconscious warrior to even think about such a thing.   <br />
<br />
I'll grant you that you have a valid concern for tank slot #1 if a 25% mit disc were to be filtered down to pre-time content, which I cannot see happenning with the way it's been presented, but no one has a leg to stand on in arguing that #2 and down the line would be threatened in any way.  AE taunt and /disc furious are FAR FAR FAR... LIGHT YEARS above what they would provide.</div></div><hr />

Superchum, whirlwind get a LOT of use in Ikkinz trials.   Every second of damage free tanking is of extreme power.  Did one trial with 2 monks + Me + bard + cleric + druid... both monks whirlwinded, whiel I was doing damage, then I ae taunt + furious, and by the time I was taking defensive damage, the mob was around half life.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">and our heals generally dont do a damn thing <br />
<br />
Not really.  We did Ikkinz trial 1 named with cleric / pally healing, instead of our usual cleric / shaman.  Worked fine.  Pallys may not be a tank, but that doesn't mean there isn't a spot for them, and aren't they lesser tanks because they can use their utility to do other jobs?  As for sks, I haven't grouped with one for a very long time (none in guild, haven't grouped out of guild for a long time), so I don't know what they could do other than decent dps.<br />
<br />
People are pissy that you need a warrior for the trials, yet no one says anything about needing a cleric.  What is the difference here?  Since pallys at least can do another function, and are useful if not tanking, thus tanking not stacking doesn't actually cause a problem imo.  Every group I do we have to have a back up healer, just in case, and pallys can do such.<br />
<br />
As for a dodge all disc, I've believed for a while now that knights should be able to get one.  A 24 second version would not bother me in the least.<br />
<br />
Now defensive, and a trade.  My biggest issue with this, is that we would be giving away our last class defining ability.  I don't want a watered down knight ability back, I want something that makes everyone know that you are a warrior when you do it.  I want something that young warriors will look forward to, and I want to be proud that we have something that makes us truly unique.<br />
<br />
Some specifications that I think should be included should knights get watered down defensive (25%).  First, 40 min reuse (as has been said often).  I think it should only last 1 minute.  The fights they need help are short fights, considering they have aggro lock, the group should be able to do faster dps.  If they got a dodge disc, being able to use it before the new defensive would be fine, but dodge should be cut down to no more than 18 seconds, and preferably 12 seconds.  Lastly, I think they should be required to use shield while using this disc.</div></div><hr />

I personally don't care for that either.  However, that is a fight for the druid/shaman if they choose - Paladins should not be capable main healers, backup or emergency sure.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's a great way to wrap up the concern.  I think a little differently, but I think that when the melee rebalancing came we got something else that's TOTALLY unique to use, and that's the ability to go furious to defensive.    That was in my view the single biggest upgrade we got in the melee reblancing and it's why I think that we'll remain on top of the heap no matter what.   I use furious to defensive every time I do Ikk, and I don't think that Knights having half of defensive even comes remotely close to that.</div></div><hr />

 Just a minor nit to pick, but there ARE times AETaunt is bugged. Even lil' ol' me has had that happen now and again. Nothing is more reliable to me than an always working way to generate a set amount of hate, especially if you can do it over and over again every 4 seconds.

For what it's worth, I think Battleblade's breakdown of the situation is pretty much spot on.  That said, I don't think the current solution outlined by Brenlo on the eqlive forums addresses these issues in any meaningfull way.  It is possible that the issues will no longer be relevant in the instanced zones, but knights will be in sorry shape throughout the rest of GoD.  At the same time, I have grave concerns that adjustments to knight tanked trials will make them too easy relative to warrior tanked trials, creating an imbalance in the opposite direction.</div></div><hr />

As for a pally being main healer thats a different story.  I am in korea and usually end up grouping w/ a few aussie players to push though a LDoN or 2 at night.

I will MT and the pally will player healer for the entire adventure (attacking only to help finish off the occasion mob or rooting for CC as needed).  <br />
<br />
A pally can be a capable main healer depending on the situation and who the MT is (I was tapping as need and have a self buff LT and a LT aug on weapon).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Aszuth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">First a little history on myself so you know where I'm coming from - I'm basically the primary cleric in my guild, and due to AA/gear/playtime I've run probably ten times the trials than the average Joe in my guild. Repeating the trials because you're a required class for them day after day and only have a limited number of spots to have ANY variety sucks, and it sucks bad. <br />
<br />
Here the warrior community is, being thrown a concept to help alleviate the stress on you (that the very same community was complaining about a few weeks ago regarding Tipt, before people refined strats for Jhiru) running the trials a bazillion times on a SIX MAN Tier 2 trial. Mathmatically - there's 15 classes now, I think - split that into the 6 slots and you should have 2.5 classes that are viable for each in a SIX MAN environment...<br />
<br />
Are you guys absolutely insane and having such a kneejerk reaction that you would rather have to run these trials upwards of 10-15 times each for the complete sequence to flag your guilds up, rather than try to find a happy medium? Asking for more work with less reward (pay) is insanity....<br />
<br />
SOE is NOT talking about Knights getting defensive outside of Ikkinz, anyone who's even said such a thing needs to learn what the topic is and come back.<br />
<br />
Even within Ikkinz the details are sketchy about the specifics, supposedly 25% groupwide shielding - but does it fade if the Knight leaves the zone, as an example? (AKA dies)<br />
<br />
The purpose of this is to reduce a stressful bottleneck on your class, and rather than taking it for what it is you're deciding to bitch and moan about it - half of it off topic. It would make my day if I read tomorrow that shaman and druid healing in the trials was going to be scaled to make them more effective replacements to a cleric within them.<br />
<br />
The one gentleman who asked for a melee DPS upgrade within Ikkinz I would agree with somewhat, although to be fair I think the effect should be groupwide and effecting all sorts of DPS. [Then again Bards would probably bitch about encroaching on Rizlona so the circle continues (but then again, I took 10 min or less to think up a tweak)].<br />
<br />
Finally, if you haven't tried Ikkinz to know what the topic really is about, please do yourself a favor and try to not get involved in the discussion - we're discussing a few limited encounters, for those of you at AoW level progession or whatever these changes will not effect you any time soon.<br />
<br />
In closing - if this turns into some widespread change outside of Ikkinz (and any other 6-man content), I'll be right there fighting beside you - because outside of the 6-man trials knights are pretty well balanced IMO - but to challenge something like the current plans, which effect nothing outside of Ikkinz, is just assinine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The beastlords in mine never cast it on me, nor any of the monks in my guild. I'm pretty sure my ranger friend and rogue friend have never had it cast on themselves either. I'm also pretty sure the beastlords themselves have cast it regularly on themselves and their pets. I gave up trying to get Fero a long time ago.<br />
<br />
But that's more of a personal thing there. And from my personal experience I do enjoy the SK atk buff and do actually get to see it up in my window quite a bit. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Kadah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">Lets get this back on track.<br />
I agree that the changes wont affect many who dont do ikkinz, However, as SoE track record show's, they dont exactly know how to put anything into affect without fucking it up<br />
Now I agree in theory that plate hybrids need some kind of a fix, However gimping trials is not the way to do so. But should SoE decide that is the only way congrats.<br />
<br />
However I'd like warrior trial mobs to have significently less AC then Allowing for more group dps upon them. Why you may ask is this. If plate hybrids are gimped to the point of no challange, Then warriors will not be a viable option for these trials.And then we will be back to square one. <br />
<br />
Instead giving the option of either less risk less reward with plate hybrids, Or more risk more reward with warriors would also be a valid way of balancing the trials. Simply gimping the mob dps and letting (no offense) Plate hybrids walk the trials and giving the same reward will be a smack to everyone plate hybrid , and warrior alike that has made it through that trial legitly.<br />
<br />
So back to square one. Since trials are going to be reduced in some manor or fashion for plate hybrids to more effectively tank, what offer should then be given to warriors to keep the status quo up while tanking these trials?<br />
<br />
Or better yet how about simply just doing the same as LDoN , The party can simply choose Easy or Hard when entering trials, and thus have zero conflict about having a plate hyrbid or warrior tank them.<br />
<br />
Peace</div></div><hr />

You're right, mobs hitting for less thus making it easier for the rest of the people if they take a knight makes complete sense.  Switching warrior and knight position so that warriors are now the weak ones is a great idea.  Are you sure you don't work for SOE, cause that's some great logic.<br />
<br />
Now, if you would stop with your idiotic &quot;I'm smarter than you&quot; thought process, you could take the time to realize that this thread is not about what SOE is actually doing, this thread is specifically a discussion about what we think would be a fair trade regarding defensive since we don't trust SOE to get this right, and because their fix leaves room for problems later down the road.</div></div><hr />

Stop derailing the thread.<br />
It isnt a moot point, Now if you review my last post, I talked about the set up of the supposed Ikkinz plate hybrid trials. Now would it not be easier to instead do as Frodlin has said, and I have said. Let the group pick either progression (and spawn the boss mob) or adventure which no boss spawns. <br />
<br />
That would kinda be like a LDoN easy / hard for all classes thereby allowing plate hybrids and to a lesser extent some lower geared warriors the chance to view the expansion and go through it up to a point. While letting those that know the risks go agaisnt the hard hitting bosses.<br />
<br />
That would be a better trade off then giving a rumored mini defensive thats always on to your group because you want a plate hybrid? Or if no one wants to bite on the easy hard view, then there is always the option of mini aggresive for those that go with a warrior into trials. <br />
<br />
Now please take bitching to the outhouse, This is for balance issues, not whining.<br />

At game wide changes? I'd agree.<br />
<br />
But let me reiterate: we're talking about a few bosses, for  three specifid one group encounters.  They've changed mobs quite successfully before, with examples too numberous too mention.  Hell, when the mod rod change went in, they changed *alot* of mobs, and the game was much better for it.<br />
<br />
Once again, for those who are slow, and need undergarment detangling: this is about 3 encounters, and only even a few mobs in those encounters, not a pervasive, game wide change.</div></div><hr />

Goddamn, I'm sick of idiots.  The fact is that if they do decrease how much the boss mob hits for, it's like a permanent defensive against that mob, without any of the drawbacks.  Do we know exactly what they are doing?  No.  However, we do know that if they do that (which is fairly expected since knights are getting killed to fast), then that would be the effect.  And yes, we're whiny greedy wimps cause we are discussing giving knights defensive and what we would like given to our class since we would lose our last class defining ability.  Moron.  Learn to read then come back, ok?<br />
<br />
Now, for those with multiple brain cells, any ideas as to what would work as a new class defining ability?  I personally disagree with being able to chain riposte then def as counting, simply because other classes can chain their discs; I just think something more unique would be better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u73"><b>Kadah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p73">Bum I shall endever to explain my reasoning behind this.<br />
Certain encounters are being tweaked to specfically make plate hybrids more attractive as a tank during these encounter's. Now Not knowing how they are going to make these changes, We are discussuing that if certain ways were implemented that plate hybrids would be easily chosen over warriors for a &quot;easy&quot; win.<br />
<br />
Now then, what this entire thread is about is making sure they dont fuck the very little balance there is in these places.  Going past this, I have said again, as has Frodlin. that perhaps it would simply be easier for SoE to make these changes by giving the group the option of A &quot;Adventure&quot; run, where the boss dosent spawn and you just go and kill stuff and have fun. <br />
Or B. Advancement run. where in the standard boss mob would be where he was, and would still do normal DPS etc thus keeping the integrity of the expansion alive without whoring it out.  <br />
<br />
Notice this dosent envolve plate hybrid getting any chances , yet in one, they would still be viable tank options to run around and farm. In the later, yes you would need a TOP end plate hybrid. or mid level + ep warrior to advance through the trials. <br />
<br />
Now, Being that SoE will more then likely not do either of the two, and they simply reduce the dps on the boss mob agaisnt plate hybrids. then there must be something given to warriors to keep them a viable option going through Ikkinz trials. <br />
<br />
Dicussion at hand is leading more and more out of whack of crying, and this isnt the outhouse. Go there and bitch and complaign, this is for positive warrior / plate hybrid feedback so that we can maintain balance in Ikkinz / Tipt while allowing hybrids a greater success rate. This dosent entail simply givin g hybrids everything they want, As the warrior class must also be considered when doing anything to alter said trials. <br />
<br />
If theya re made too easy then hybrids will become the prefered method of grouping again and we will be back at square one.  So I am merely suggesting one of many options when I have mentioned a aggresive style increase when using a warrior to tank said trials, to keep things in check. <br />
<br />
Now Please if you could post constructive criticism, As whatever changes they start now in Ikkinz / Tipt may have severe affects further down the Discord trail.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>Gobsmash Emgood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">I dont favor a +attack bonus to compensate for knights getting a mini defensive. I think the better way may be to give warriors a mini-defensive of our own that is not on a timer at all and can be used at will as long as there are no other dis's running and mitigates 5 or 10% less than the knight one. It should have a long timer and a moderate cost to allow warriors to keep it up at a moderate cost to END.<br />
<br />
Just fixing those 3 mobs does not fix the other problems in GoD, I am quite sure that time level knights can tank the end mob in the sewers 1 trials but paladins from AoW level guilds are in the same boat as paladins from Ikkinz while similar level warriors can get through it via defensive and furrious. GoD is not all time level and the mobs below the time level content are just as much out of wack.<br />
<br />
Most every fix or counter balance that warriors want in return is wanted at all times in all zones, it is not fair to expect to get something like that for an ability that is only useable on 3 mobs.<br />
<br />
My idea is giveing an agro reduction to knights when they are useing there mini-defensive is the only good balance to truely keep warriors in the front while giveing knights a chance to complet the harder trials with a better success rate and allow knights to off tank in GoD with a bit more safty but keeping warriors as the perfered off tanks.<br />
<br />
Does anyone see a way that would be abused or cause warriors to be un desireable in groups?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u78"><b>lokkak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p78">A new skill I think should be added:<br />
<br />
A spell (like incite is a spell) that uses say 400 endurance and causes the primary weapon (either the 1H in primary or the 2H) to fire off any and all procs (Effect: blah {combat} ) on the weapon.<br />
<br />
In effect, a way to trigger a proc.  Put it on the same 30 second refresh timer as Incite.  It is more needed in GoD, where you need agro faster than normal exp groups.  The current regen rate of 28 endurance per tick would limit this to not being used on every mob, since it would take approx 85 seconds to regen the endurance for a 400 endurance ability.  This doesn't take into account the time to regen Incite.</div></div><hr />

How did I feel about opening up lower planes?<br />
I didn't care. I was already well past those when that happened, and I was actually happy for those people who could now see content for which they paid.   Those planes were nothing special, and opening them up improved, not detracted from the game.<br />
<br />
As for how VI will accomplish this, I think I'd opt for the easy answer, they'll pop different versions of the bosses.  Supah-ninjah no icon group buffs, and stealth discs seem nice board fodder to make people angry, but don't seem too likely.  <br />
<br />
And once again: the odds are that most(and for nit pickers, I said *most* not all)  of those who are panty-knotted about this have not actually even seen this trial.  Nor have you tried to get an entire guild through it.  The class balance is part of this, but this is more of an overall player base change, than one meant to affect a few classes.<br />
<br />
Hey here's another one for the whiners: they are supposedly changing the Qinimi 3 group encounter for the breakdown in communication quest.  Right now that trial pops 3 mobs that quad 3800, and cast call of the Ikaav (an unresistable mez).  Where is the hand wringing? Where is the bleating? Where is the &quot;OMGz they izz taking our stuffz!&quot;  Don't disappoint me!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u80"><b>Bumraz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p80">Knights becoming the &quot;preferred tank&quot; for Ikkinz is just more inflammatory hyperbole.  For most guilds working through these trials, the issue is not &quot;Gee, all these tanks available for these trials during time off from raids, whom shall we choose.&quot;  The issue is availability of viable tanks period.  Most guilds at that stage of the game don't have craploads of warriors who just hang out waiting to do trials for the umpteenth time.</div></div><hr />
