Hi all, <br />
<br />
    Wanted to introduce myself since I havent really posted here.  But proud to say I made Overlord this weekend and man was it a rush. All the goings on aside, I was in awe that I even made it this far and through all the ups and downs I still love being a warrior. I've trolled thru this board so much since I learned about it, which was a few months ago and have learned a LOT of useful information about being a tank, being as clueless as I was when I started playing a year ago. Anyway I wanted to keep this short and thank all of you for helping me out. Yes, even the flames, arguments, jokes and occasional non-warrior visitors. It's all been a trip and I loved em. I'm not an uber warrior by any means and I still look forward to a lot of the stuff you guys talk about, which is what really drives me, to go and do the things most of you did and keep drooling at yer Magelos lol..alright this has been too long and my throat is dry, so drink up!!<br />

Now you can get a little bit of buffer experience and begin to grind out your defensive AA and before you know it people will be drooling over your magelo profile.</div></div><hr />

Now just get 6% in regular exp and go straight AA's. It's what I did a couple months ago, and I'm nearing completion of my hp AA's and about to go back to defense ones. It's pretty neat to be able to look forward to new toys:)<br />
<br />
I see you have ND1. Finish it on up, and you'll be able to get AE taunt. It's not the be all, end all but it sure is a nice trick to have when the poo hits the fan.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I prefer 13% in, because that's 2 deaths, I haven't died twice in a row yet, but I like the safety net.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gharghael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">AHA! I knew I had a reason to get drunk today... This must be it!<br />
Thanks, and CONGRATULATIONS!</div></div><hr />
