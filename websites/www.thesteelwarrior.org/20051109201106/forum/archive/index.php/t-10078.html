I'm going protective talents atm, lvl 31, using shield and 1 hander. Yah i know lots say thats not the way to go for a warrior till later, but i am grouped 24/7 ussually with my gf priest and a few friends so ussually spend most of my time taking the hits. but thats not my question. What do ya'll think is the most important thing on a weapon atm, dps or speed of the weapon? I'm not sure but seem to remember reading that speed helps generate more rage, but is it worth giving up dps for? &lt;3</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">12-21-2004, 10:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think it depends on two things: your build and the amount of rage you develope with it. For 90% of the setups, DPS = agro = rage. (Heck I just got a blue 2h weapon for my level and it felt like I had all the rage generation talents.) However, if you have Unbrideled Wrath (lets you get 1 extra rage on a per swing basis, unto 40% fo swings) and are fighting things where you consistantly hit for less than 20, then the DPS hardly matters and speed would become very important as</div></div><hr />

If I'm not mistaken, unbrideled wrath only generates extra rage points on hits, not misses =\</div></div><hr />

Faster is better for sure if i do not DW in a instace and tank in def stance i jsut use a 2hnder in zerker stance and pull like 3-5 mobs at a time and WW them and DS some times that holds agro better and now that you take 10% less damage its even better ,now i jsut gotta see how the 10% haste nerf is gonna be  :mad: <br />
3% to crits i dought even comes close.</div></div><hr />
