<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sangiovese</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So it looks like SOE is going to stick with weapon procs as the means for warriors to generate aggro.  At least they are adding some weapons with +hate procs for the lower to medium end game where there previously weren't any.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, that means we are stuck with the same problem... it works fine after we have some time to build up aggro and get a few procs - but we are still at the mercy of a random event.  If a Knight needs aggro, he casts a spell and he gets it (whether the spell lands or not doesn't matter).  If we need aggro, we pray for a successful taunt or a weapon proc (taunt does nothing if it fails... the proc we have zero control over).<br />
<br />
So how do you fix it?  The &quot;taming your weapon&quot; suggestion I think was on the right track, but wasn't simple enough and started adding too much.<br />
<br />
So here is my idea.  At level 50, give warriors an ability called &quot;weapon mastery&quot; or something along those lines.  It gets a button in the UI and has a refresh time of one minute.  When you activate the ability, it forces a proc of the weapon in your main hand on the next swing.<br />
<br />
Other than being able to force one proc per minute, procs are otherwise unaffected.<br />
<br />
The reuse time would drop by one second per level, for a 45 second refresh at 65.<br />
<br />
This would allow us a small &quot;snap aggro&quot; effect that would scale up depending on gear... but an extra proc every 45 seconds wouldn't be something that I think would overpower us... and Knights would still have an advantage because they can still chain cast.<br />
<br />
I don't mind knights having an advantage over us in aggro control.  I DO mind being completely unable to do anything other than &quot;hope for a proc&quot; to gain aggro.<br />
<br />
Thoughts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Stop thinking that knights were designed with aggro control in mind.  They weren't.  it's a welcome side effect of their situation right now.<br />
<br />
A big problem right now is that everyone is starting to believe the line of bullshit that knights were designed to hold aggro better because they can't tank as well.  It's complete garbage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have never seen an issue with Warriors having one new reasonably reset time skill that generates hate and possibly a good effect.   Remember the arguement cuts both ways: If the difference between Warrior and Knight HP/AC is marginal then it can't be a pro or a con.<br />
<br />
Knights seemed to be designed to be more flexible from the start.  Now in POP its shows just how useful this flexiblity is.  Even if a Stun had zero agro, its gives someone a free chance to escape because the monster is unable to act.  Unless there is something a Warrior can do that is just as handy I don't think its a mistake how miserable Warriors are now.<br />
<br />
Simply put: Is it better to have 1 chance to taunt or 4 chances?  Its better to have 4.  This is why Knights have an advantage of Warriors.  If Warriors get just one reliable skill then gee...I don't see much of an issue let alone steping on toes. ^_^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Haass, didnt you mean to say, &quot;A big problem right now is that everyone is starting to believe the line of bullshit that knights were designed to hold aggro better because they CAN tank as well. &quot;?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sangiovese</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Haas, I understand about knights were designed.  I played one to 50 back when 50 was the cap.  I saw their problems and I saw them get some much needed improvements.  (Most Notable: vastly improved DPS due to one handed itemization and two handed weapon changes... and mana penalty removed)<br />
<br />
Regardless of how they were designed - in the current state of the game, they are known primarily as good tanks with exceptional aggro management ability.  Any &quot;balancing&quot; that happens now will have to take into account that no matter where they started... currently Knights ability to control aggro is one of their strong points.  However, just because they are good at it, doesn't mean that the world will end if someone else becomes a little better at it also (Just like clerics didn't become obsolete when druids/shammies were given a HUGE increase in healing capability).<br />
<br />
But this thread isn't really supposed to be about all that. I'm trying to propose an idea that might make warriors a little better at doing our jobs (gaining and maintaining aggro, and being able to survive the punishment the mob deals out).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kaldanm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I dont thing giving us snap aggro is stepping on Knightly toes.<br />
Lets say you are a non tank class and need a tank for your pickup group, there's a sk 65, a war 65, a pal 65 LFGing. you know them as skillfull players, and you camp some trivial mobs in PoV or BoT. wich one will you take.<br />
- If you have only a cleric (or only a druid) as healer, you will take the pally.<br />
- if you really need to snare the mobs or you need a puller too, it will be the sk...<br />
- if you may have a hard hitter miniboss to tank, you will take the warrior.<br />
otherwise... it will be random. there is no difference at all because xp mobs are TRIVIAL to tank. usually you will take the first to announce his LFG. its just like damage dealers. you need damage ? you take the first DD to come regardless of his class : monk/rogue/wizard/mage.<br />
<br />
However this is not true if you doubt of the warrior starting aggro. I know there are enchanters that dont rune themself BECAUSE they group with knights and dont need that in their boring and secured pop camp. <br />
there is a another question question however : will snap aggro for warriors trivialise some content ? I think it will, slightly, on those encounter where you tank for 30 secondes alone waiting to build enough aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Panazule</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The best solution I have been able to come up with to address our snap aggro issues while not trivializing raid encounters was to base the aggro on the level of the mob.<br />
<br />
In PoP it's safe to say that any boss mob is going to be 66+ (and even that is a low figure).<br />
<br />
If we were given some sort of a AA that would give us a taunt button that would only effect mobs under level 65, even if it has a chance for failure, would give us some form of snap aggro that would effect our exp groups but not take the challenge out of a raid encounter.  The counter could be 1 min, 45, 30 basied on a 3/6/9 AA or something like that.<br />
<br />
I'm a warrior and even I see the downside of giving us the ability to snap aggro without failure and no restrictions.  It would take away much of the strategy and skill needed for many things in EQ.<br />
<br />
The only way I can see maintaining this balance and fixing our situation in exp groups is by taking the level of the mob your fighting into account.<br />
<br />
Some people have brought up the idea of giving warriors other skills such as a &quot;Group Shield&quot; aa, that would shield your group members while they were getting beat on so you could get aggro.  While in theory and in roleplay maybe this is a good idea, I just don't think that the average exp group is going to want to bother to have to rely on it.<br />
<br />
As far as stepping on toes, I don't really think giving us a snap aggro that we must work for via AA is bad.  A Paladin still has his group heals and the ability to chain cast his snap aggro as well as LoH in a pinch.  A SK still brings such things to the table as group mana taps, pulling abilities, chain casting aggro spells, group heals, lifetap proccing weapons with aa's that make them crit for well over 1k a shot, and so on.<br />
<br />
My point is even though a warrior has more HP than a SK/Paladin and a slightly higher defense, a SK/Paladin has other things that significantly make them attractive to a group for exp even if warriors were bumped up to be close to their aggro abilities.  Let's face it, once your hitting 7,8,9k hp anyway, there is little matter, the only difference is what percentage the cleric starts their ch.  As long as the group is chain pulling, whats the difference if the cleric is at 80 or 40 mana the entire time.<br />
<br />
It's certainly not a black and white issue because making the wrong decision here could drastically change the way EQ is experienced but it's not a situation that cannot be solved.  Whether SoE bothers to solve it is something that I wonder about.</div></div><hr />
