I would say two grps min based on your being level 60th.  You don't have to move him to the CY (as outlined on my web site), I just do this cause its easier for me to move him to the raid instead of the raid to him.<br />
<br />
Expect cleric to get some aggro on first heal (I would suggest cleric DA after first heal assuming they will get it).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Evasive helps with the lifetaps i believe. Enchanter chain rune as welll, given that hes a bad ass version of VS. Go in and tank him for  abit to get aggro nice and good. I shoudlnt have thought that  CH chain is necessary and you dont want heal aggro so spam the fast heals until you have him locked down. Just make sure that no one gets in front of him apart from you.<br />
<br />
Treat this guy with a little bit of respect, he may be level 55 but ive known him to wipe some 30/40+ people raids down the hole.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thalzaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">buff your MR the highest you can get and you'll resist or get alot of partial lifetaps. Last time i fought him, i loaded up 2hs, attacked then furious, the let clerics sort out the heals. With about 240MR (only used self buff and no bard) i resisted a couple lifetaps and got bunch of partials. With higher MR i'm sure i could resist most if not all the lifetaps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sanori</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks everyone for the great info!! :D <br />
<br />
I have done some reading on a few pages now, but I don't see any info about Nortlav's spawn habits.  Respawn time, etc.<br />
<br />
EDIT:  ok reread post above, seems he's on 7 day spawn.  Can that be confirmed?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Yroc Morf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I tried him out this weekend.  At lvl 60 with 238 MR I let him proc on me around 100 times.<br />
<br />
There were zero full resists.<br />
~ 75% of the procs hit for full.<br />
~ 25% of the procs hit for less than full.<br />
<br />
The best case scenario was a life tap for 30hp.  I also noted that he commonly procs 2-3 times in a row (near killing me each time he did this).<br />
<br />
Since I was tanking him.... I also tried to disarm him (no go)... weapon is magic.  We also tried to fear him (no go).... too resistant...<br />
<br />
I will try again sometime with a bard for uber MR.. and also when I get to 65 with and without bard to see how it goes (just for fun of course).</div></div><hr />
