I was browsing around Google (www.google.com) and found a screenshot that brought back a LOT of memories.<br />
The pic below was the first role playing game ( i think you can call it that ) that I ever tried. i think I was about 13 when I was hooked on and blew up 3 Commodore 64's playing Telengard...My friend down the street had a Commodore too and him and I would trade saved games on our casette tapes and see how high we could get. It was pretty much my first ever game I rewrote in order to make my little godkiller.<br />
<br />
man it was too cool. It looked like this below. funny how i think about it it was about 20 years ago.</div></div><hr />

It was a lot of fun.  I had no idea what to do =)  We wandered around this volcano temple with premade characters.  It was so much fun figuring out ways out of situations.  Like using a ladder to cross a chasm, or throwing holy water at &quot;hell hound.&quot;<br />
<br />
Man that was a blast, since then, played ADnD 2nd, and now DnD 3rd and EQ RPG.  I'd love to get back into playing again.  Though I'm way burned out of Running games, did so forever!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ninamwen</div><div class="date">07-07-2003, 06:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Final Fantasy 7 on the PlayStation probably  :)  I love that game so much and can still play it over!  Best accomplishment was defeating all weapons without any cheats!!!  Anyone who's played it will know how hard that damn Ruby weapon was!  Toasted it!!  *struts*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">07-07-2003, 06:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First RPG: Dungeons and Dragons, basic set. Think my first character ever was a hallfling rogue. He died quick that day. I think to a bugbear. Maybe it was some slime. After that I tended to make warriors. Then paladins and cavaliers when me and my friends moved up to AD&amp;D.<br />
<br />
First Magic Deck: This horrible green &quot;stompy&quot; monstrosity built out of the first 12 packs I ever bought.<br />
<br />
First Tournament Magic Deck: Blue Skies. I SHALL THWART YOU! Won a lot of matches with that deck. I loved masques block.<br />
<br />
First Game I ever became Obsessed With: Microleague Baseball. I did whole seasons. Even got my friends involved. Years later, some of those friends would play whole seasons of Sega Hockey with me Freshmen year in college, where we kept our own stats and had a playoff system. Ah, the memories.<br />
<br />
First ONLINE gaming experience: NASCAR Racing II simulator, online league. I even won a plaque that year. A plaque! Hah. <br />
<br />
First RPG video game: One of those forgotten realms D&amp;D things. Was a total blast. And probably why I got hooked so easily into EQ. EQ reminded me of that game.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Calinthalus</div><div class="date">07-07-2003, 10:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My first RPG was the old Red Box D&amp;D Basic set.  I rolled up a wizard, I was 7 years old and had just finished the LotR trilogy.  Gandalf was my hero.  Well, to make a long story short I went into the first battle and cast my Magic Missle and nuked a orc.  Then the next round I roll initiative again and on my turn I say, &quot;ok, I shoot it again&quot; to which the GM says &quot;well, no, you can only cast that spell once.&quot;  I'm like, so what do I do now?  He says, &quot;well, you can stab him with your dagger&quot;.........&quot;with only 2 hps to my name I'd be crushed&quot;........&quot;yeah&quot;<br />
<br />
Needless to say I rolled up a Warrior the next time we played and ever since then every time I start a new game system I start with a warrior.  My first Vampire was a Gangrel, my first Werewolf was a Ahroun Stargazer...... the list goes on and on.  This is the first toon I made for EQ (named after one of my favorite D&amp;D characters) that was right before Velious came out.  And it still my only toon over level 30.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sturgis</div><div class="date">07-08-2003, 12:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Started with basic D&amp;D in 1980 when I was in 6th grade. Played that with my brothers and our friends a lot until I was a freshman in high school. Played it occassionally after 9th grade but never got back into D&amp;D like when I was in junior high. I'd played basic and advanced D&amp;D, never 2nd edition, 3rd edition or whatever it is nowadays.<br />
<br />
Many years later I got my first computer, and one of the first online games I got into was Dragonrealms. It was a text-based RPG (same company as Gemstone III). Played that game about 2.5 years before EQ came out. <br />
<br />
I didnt get EQ right away when it came out, though - I assumed it was just another Daggerfall type thing. Finally checked it out one day and started playing in July of 99...and still playing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My first computer RPG was Wizardry (notice the conspicuous lack of a number following the name... it was on an Apple II back in the early 80s.<br />
<br />
My first online RPG was Ultima Online... played on the Lake Superior server.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First console game was around that time as well. Final Fantasy 1.<br />
<br />
Someone brought up Magic and tabletop. Started Magic in Revised Edition, and quit at Fifth. Started D&amp;D 2nd edition.<br />
<br />
First online rpg... Ultima Online, I think... favorite? Neverwinter Nights, if that counts. I play regularly with a solid world and a team of great DMs. That game, if played correctly with good people, is mind-bendingly good.</div></div><hr />

I first started GS as a Beta Tester on Prodigy, back when it was still 3.50 an hour for those that didnt have a comped account. Played that game for like 5 years, and went to 4 of the Simucon conventions in St louis. I still keep thinking about reactivating my account there to go visit and see if anyone I knew is still playing.<br />
<br />
<br />
My first real RPG was probably the original Final Fantasy for the original Nintendo.<br />
<br />
Course my fist video game was an old Magnavox system that played Pong, and a breakout thing, all in black and white back when I was a kid. Then I bought an Intellivision when I was like 18. Never had an Atari but played a few of them, and then got that Nintendo when I first saw the then amazing graphics of Mario bros.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Friedrick</div><div class="date">07-08-2003, 05:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A game called Top Secret.  What can I say, I like shooting things, as I have grown up hunting.  It was a secret agent type game that I liked.  Never really go into too many others although played Deadlands, DND, and Marvels some and Gurps.</div></div><hr />

3) Turn over tape and start side 2<br />
4) Read &quot;War and Peace&quot;<br />
5) Play Telengard<br />

Also, there are still BBS's that run Usurper and Legend of the Red Dragon, I was playing both of them at work (where I am now) to waste time up until about 2 months ago.</div></div><hr />

I think my first RPG that I can remember is Final Fantasy: Mystic Quest :).  I've played just about all the series there are.  Final Fantasy, Dragon Warrior, Breath of Fire etc. owned them all.  To this day I still think Final Fantasy 5 is the hardest RPG in the world :mad:</div></div><hr />

Final Fantasy - NES<br />
Chrystalis - NES (that game OWNED)<br />
Phantasy Star II - Genesis<br />
Dragon Warrior - NES<br />
Shining in the Darkness - Genesis<br />
Faxanadu - NES<br />
<br />
I also played some text based MUD's on my old C-64 (go go 2400 baud modem).  I don't remember any of their names, though.  The only one I really remember involved a haunted mansion where you were given another player's name and had to hunt them down and kill them.  First, though, you had to find parts of weapons and put it together.  Pretty cool!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lesee... my very, very first RPG was D&amp;D, I forget which edition.  I was about 7 when I started that.  Brother DM'd a campagin that my counsins and I played in.  *sniffle*  I still have all my funky 6+ sided dice. The 30 sider is my pride and joy of the collection!  Early on, I usually played Mages.  After middle school, I prefered paladin characters.  (Lady Zeparah of the House  Dragonbane, the character I played most recently... sometime 2 years ago.)<br />
<br />
I've played ALL of the Forgotten Realms computer games.  Most were either were on a Commodore 128 or an Amiga1200. (I THINK it was a 1200, but it was destroyed in a move. *cries*)  I beat every single game in the Pool of Radience line.  <br />
<br />
I've played FF1 thru FF9, but I really lost my taste for it since the bomb that was FF8.  However, I've been playing FF5 (Japanese, was not released in the U.S.) on an emulator.  DAMN!  That's a fun game!  I've also played all of the Zelda games.  <br />
<br />
Before EQ, my obcession in the way of games was Magic: The Gathering.  My boyfriend at the time had gotten me addicted to the card game, and then later EQ.  Damn him!!  DAMN HIM!!  *chuckle*</div></div><hr />
