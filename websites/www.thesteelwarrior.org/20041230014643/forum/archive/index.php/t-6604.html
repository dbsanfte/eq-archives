<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Balfamor</div><div class="date">04-09-2004, 09:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I recently upgraded from Ornate Helm to Helm of Rallos Zek, but I'm so used to not having a helm graphic, that having one now seems so odd.  I vaguely remember hearing about some NPC you could talk to who would make helms (any maybe other armor) not have graphics.  Anyone have info on this?</div></div><hr />

Sorry I don't know if he's still there, but I haven't heard of anyone making an invisible helmet.</div></div><hr />

From the text he says I don't think it will take the graphic away from helms that are not customizable in the first place.</div></div><hr />

GAG!  I went from champion crown to myrmidon crown purely to dump the graphic!!  Female wood elf plate helm makes me think the artist got their inspiration from a WWI German army hat!</div></div><hr />

However, if you have an illusion at your disposal (Amulet of Necropotence for instance- though any illusion will work), you can work around the graphics.<br />
<br />
1) Take helm off.<br />
2) Click illusion.<br />
3) Put helm on.<br />
4) Click off illusion.<br />
5) Observe the fact that your helm graphic has disappeared and rejoice.<br />
<br />
Note: you need to do this each time you zone.</div></div><hr />

Thank god I've spent most of my time in game with graphicless hats and/or headbands.<br />
<br />
I don't really mind the helmet look on my warrior though. Halflings on Luclin models get ok little helmets.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think what you may have heard of was about velius helms being customized perhaps?  Unfortunately that doesn't work with all helms.</div></div><hr />
