The info I gave should have been givin anyway as it is a bug I find it humourous though no pally has address the bug I mentioned *shrug* if the bug adversely affects you you whine if it helps you you keep quiet guess that just the nature of things for most people. But being as I work for the largets software company in the world and test software for them I tend to look at things a bit differently I used th ethread as a excuse to publically announce the bugf and get it fixed.</div></div><hr />
