<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarcazzm</div><div class="date">12-09-2004, 12:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Allakhazam lists factions in this order:<br />
+4, ally <br />
+3, warmly <br />
+2, kindly <br />
+1, amiably <br />
0, indifferently <br />
-1, apprehensively <br />
-2, dubiously <br />
-3, threateningly <br />
-4, ready to attack <br />
<br />
Does anyone know a good guide for approximately how many faction hits it takes to move through each level start to finish? I realize any such guide would be vague at best but I want a reference while im grinding loyalist faction. Any advice would be appriciated</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">boy-</div><div class="date">12-09-2004, 01:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">-2000 to -801, scowls at you, ready to attack<br />
-800 to -501, views you threateningly<br />
-500 to -101, scowls at you dubiously<br />
-100 to -1, is apprehensive<br />
0 to 99, is indifferent<br />
100 to 499, is amiable<br />
500 to 699, kindly considers you<br />
700 to 1099, views you warmly<br />
1100 to 2000, you are an ally<br />
<br />
<br />
Taken from the old chardok boards.  Its not entirely correct, (max kos has been speculated to be -2800ish), but as we don't start maxkos to dranik loyalist it's probably close enough.<br />
<br />
The greens in dranik scar are definitely 1 point per hit, whoknows about pg, it seems to go faster, but whether its due to more points per kill or a higher mata mob density is unknown.  The turnins (kyv hearts, murkglider somethings) hopefully are worth multiple points, but it didn't seem to be anything significantly large either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">01-29-2005, 11:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">old thread, but I googled for this information and found the following table, also considered not completely reliable:<br />
<br />
Ally = +4 1450 to 2500<br />
Warmly = +3 1100 to 1450<br />
Kindly = +2 750 to 1100<br />
Amiable = +1 150 to 750<br />
Indifferent = 0 0 to 150<br />
Apprehensive = -1 0 to -150<br />
Dubious = -2 -150 to -750<br />
Threateningly = -3 -750 to -1100<br />
Ready to Attack = -4 -1100 to –2500<br />
<br />
Though it took me freaking forever to get through dubious with the loyalists, so I wouldn't doubt it if it's 600 points rather than 400 points.</div></div><hr />
