<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ganeen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, so this is becoming a serious problem to me...  I'm about 4400 unbuffed (low end), and lately when I report my HP to the groups healer, I get a '=(' , or a 'Are you sure that's right?'.<br />
<br />
It's getting kind of embarassing, and as I was looking over my gear last night, I realised it it pretty damn bad.  I currently and unguilded, but I'm applying to an EP guild, but I wont get loot for months because they just broke in and the app process is at least a month.  I have access to about 20k right now, but I know some ele + people who could help me out if I really begged them.  Someone help me get more hp/ac heh =)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>seveirn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">finish up your HP AAs, you could easily bump your hp up to around 5600.<br />
<br />
Edit: gear suggestions (hit submit by accedent)<br />
<br />
<br />
Mana threaded bracer<br />
Ornate Helm<br />
Ornate Bracer<br />
<br />
Get rid of that mask and afford a Amygadaln chain mask when you can.<br />
<br />
can prob pick up some Greaves of the orcish master, or Kylong Greaves, they have the same ac about, and HP , plus  Stamina (more hp)<br />
<br />
Might wana think of knightly boots of Splendor, Or Ornate Boots for the effect.<br />
<br />
Arms: i dont have really many ideas for arms but ornate.<br />
<br />
Belt: the not incredibly important part, i would scout soulscream prices and Spiked Seahorse belts what not.  Mabye even a CoF if your into stickin a Sta aug on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Neck- Get something with AC, something like amulet of mummy wrappings is pretty cheap, or mithril spiked collar (not 100% sure on the name) from Veksar.  Clattering bone necklace if you cant find anything else.<br />
<br />
Rings - I'd use rings with a little AC on them, 2 valorium rings of gallantry would cost you 25hps while you gain 15 stamina and 10ac.<br />
<br />
Bracers - Pick up 2 fine heraldic bracers (25ac, 30hps, 6 svall each)<br />
<br />
Waist - upgrade the SBoC to a soul scream belt - buy or camp in Veksar<br />
<br />
Finishing ND3 and getting PE will give you a boost aswell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ugh. You wouldn't be able to tank anything in the EPs. Sorry to be so harsh, but I voted against applicants with as bad of hp/ac as you have for an EP guild. But you do want help!<br />
<br />
  General guidelines: 1sta = 6hp = 1ac until you're capped with sta. 1ac = 6hp always. Resists are a bonus, and a LOT of resists will sometimes win out over a hp or two. All other stats are worthless, ignore them.<br />
<br />
  Searching for new stuff: Go to the bazaar, do a search for every slot, one at a time, first by ac then again by hp. Apply the above formula and look for bargains.<br />
<br />
  Good things: Your earrings are just fine. They'll last you a long time. Your BP and leggings are decent, don't worry about them until later. Your cloak is ok. Your weapons are passable.<br />
<br />
  Bad things: First off, your hero bracer makes me cry. I'm not joking, just seeing it made me cringe. Look for Fine Heraldic stuff (http://www.eqtraders.com/recipes/recipe_page.php?article=75&amp;rsa=Smithing&amp;rc=HUM&amp;sb=item&amp;sub=qeynos&amp;menustr=080040070040). It's not diety restricted, so load up on it. The ac and hp should improve alot of your slots. Next, replace the rings. Hp w/o ac isn't doing so hot. Look for valorium rings of gallentry or the like.<br />
<br />
 If you have any cash left over after that, spend it on 10lb Halas Meat Pies and Grobb Liquidised meat. Get a stack of each, then just force eat other food and drink while leaving them above your normal stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hey Ganeen, what's up!<br />
<br />
I'm in a similar boat as you. I took overa year off and came back in december with 3700 hp unbuffed at level 61. Well about 2 months later I'm almost at 4700 hp unbuffed and I've bumped up my AC by about 15 :P<br />
<br />
I agree with the HP AA, that will give a lot. (I'm 2 aa from ND3 right now). Just XP like mad in BoT or Tactics (if you're flagged) and rack those AA up.<br />
<br />
I too would have better gear but I always blow my plat on twinks argh! :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm not qualified to tell you what you need to Mt in the EPs, but it does seem to me that Fitemore's advice is dead on.<br />
If I were you, I'd get a legal pad, go to the bazaar, and spend 3-4 hours checking prices on all the slots that Fitemore didn't say were good.<br />
Actually, the first thing I'd check would be bracers, and I'd be very tempted to get the heraldic stuff first thing. <br />
I'd look carefully at your rings and gauntlet and vambraces slots too. Once you get the bracers, you might find that you can afford an upgrade to the gauntlets or vambraces, but not two valorium rings of galantry. <br />
You might get more bang for your remaining pp by upgrading the either the vambraces or the gauntlets and using about 1,100 plat to get a couple of velium fire wedding rings (6AC, 65 hp each). Not as good as valorium, but they provide about 90% of the bang for 10% of the cost.<br />
And I vote with Fitemore on the stat food/drink. The meat pies will have to have a slot in your Rallic pack, but they're dirt cheap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Hormadrune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">4500ish unbuffed doesn't cut it in EPs- our monks are mostly ~5kish for reference and we've only been in the EPs since early January. Even yard trash will chew through you fast. Get those AAs done and farm some gear. Realize that once in an ele guild you'll probably have a lot less free time than you might be used to, so getting the AAs cranked out now is important.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I currently and unguilded, but I'm applying to an EP guild <br />
<br />
With all due respect my friend I'd reconsider:<br />
<br />
1. As a warr you will add little value to that guild (off tanking/ramp tanking etc) in terms of roles you can fill <br />
<br />
2. You will not get an opportunity to build any tanking skills; a warrior in a guild who does not get practice tanking skills is doing a diservice to themselves and that guild.<br />
<br />
3. You will not be able to build AAs...having full HP/DEF aas is as important, if not more important at that lvl of the game.<br />
<br />
I'd suggest:<br />
<br />
1. Work on your AAs...full time grind exp<br />
2. Maybe grind some LDoN for some pieces<br />
3. Maybe grind some pp and buy pieces mentioned above.<br />
<br />
Sorry to be so blunt.  It is your decision though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If you're low on cash, LDoN is your friend.  Armor that's as good as ornate, and doesnt cost anything but time to grind out the adv points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>paladiin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Since I'm not EP (nor is my guild even close to it), can't mention much about that, but I do see some other upgrade options.<br />
<br />
For reference, me and you are almost identical in terms of level and AA's. If you check out my magelo, you'll notice that you're about 130AC and 350hp away from me, and tanking BoT krigers and mini's make me squirm. I point out the AC, because it seems you have sacrificed a lot of AC for HP. So my suggestions come from where I am in the game.<br />
<br />
Ears: Look ok.<br />
Neck: Amulet of Mummy Wrappings as suggested, for AC and HP.<br />
Face: Fine Heraldic for AC/HP, or for a real nice item try to get a Flawless Steel Mask from SG (20ac 5sta 55hp and other stats).<br />
Fingers: As mentioned, Vallorium Rings <br />
Belt: Soulscream Belt<br />
<br />
Ok, that's the easy stuff to get.  Now for the hard but important stuff:<br />
<br />
Hands: Gauntlets of the Myrmidon. 27ac and 90hp.  Huge upgrade potential there.<br />
Arms: Ornate or Malevolent Vambraces of Suffering (LDoN - EF 760)<br />
Wrists: Ornate or Crystallized Acid Bracer<br />
Feet: Kingly Boots would be the initial upgrade, but even then the AC is low.  Ornate or Malevolent , or possibly Vindi boots.<br />
Head: Ornate, Malevolent, or Helm of Viscous Ooze (Guk 442 - what a bargin I think).<br />
<br />
The short of it - be ready to do lots of Ornate camping or LDoN hunting.  By the time you gather enough Ornate or LDoN points you'll have a big chunk of the initial AA's done too.  Even if the EP guild accepts you, I'd still stick my rear in LDoN and PoP Ornate zones until geared up appropriately.</div></div><hr />
