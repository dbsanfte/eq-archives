<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">potranus</div><div class="date">09-14-2003, 09:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">HiI I am very new to the game, got it 2 days ago, and I am wondering if anyone that plays on the 7th Hammer Server wouldnt mind helping me in game if I have questions. I have been given lots of advice and one was to find someone that wouldn't mind helping during game play. From my playing exp, which isnt much, I have a feeling I will have alot of questions to ask in game. So if you play on the 7th Hammer server and wouldn't mind me asking you questions during game play, please post here.<br />
<br />
Thanks.:)</div></div><hr />

<br />
;tell servername.playername<br />
<br />
Sometimes it uses a short version of the servername. Like Solusek Ro is just ;tell Solusek.playername. If you have a question you can see if I'm on. <br />
<br />
;tell Stormhammer.Retnaburn<br />
<br />
Also, there is a serverwide warrior channel you can join. <br />
<br />
/join serverwide.thesteelwarrior<br />
<br />
You can use /autojoin instead of /join if you want to automaticly join it when logging in. To speak in that channel type /1 or /2 etc. whatever number that channel is. Type /list to see what number that channel is set to.</div></div><hr />

Speaking of serverwide tells is there a way to see if someone is on or to add them to your friends list? like /who all servername.playername?</div></div><hr />

Not sure if there is a chat command for that. I just press my r button to reply to the last tell and it works for serverwide tells.Speaking of serverwide tells is there a way to see if someone is on or to add them to your friends list?<br />
I don't think thats possable, it would be nice tho.</div></div><hr />

Would be glad to answer any questions, Just shot me a tell.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Send all yer tells to Frodlin /nod<br />
<br />
In all honesty the serverwide channel for TSW is yer best bet to catch a quick answer :)</div></div><hr />

Sometimes I'll have plenty of opportunities to help, other times I'll be a little busy, but will get back to ya.    Send me a tell any time.</div></div><hr />
