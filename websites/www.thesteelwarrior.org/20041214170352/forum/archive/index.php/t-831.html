In fact, they are virtually useless for warriors.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Would it be accurate to say that attack rating vs AC determines modal(I think that is the term I want) damage?  Higher attack shifts modal towards max damage, while AC shifts it towards min damage.  Am I understanding that right?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GSW</div><div class="date">05-26-2003, 09:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Agi isn't the most useful skill, but it does raise your AC a bit. Dex effects how often your weapons proc, so it helps alot at higher levels when you need your weapons to proc to keep aggro. Also they somehow effect how fast your skills go up and how often you get crits. But...str and sta are more important.</div></div><hr />

<br />
AGI seems to have a substantial effect on damage taken to me.. I have been in POI groups at level 54 and when my AGI was buffed over 170 by a Shammy thing s seemed to go much smoother. We were chain pulling and my (rather crappy) HP was never going below 50 pct. I don't think it was due to the small AC increase effect of AGI alone.<br />
<br />
I also read somewhere AGI effects Dodge.<br />
<br />
That said, I wouldnt trade AGI over HP or AC im the first place.</div></div><hr />

Go to PoV, kill stuff with your AGI fully buffed and without it fully buffed, and make sure it's with the same exact group and parse your damage taken with and without. you might be shocked =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dex helps with misses.  When my Dex is maxed, I miss a lot less.  Also I get a lot more crits with dex buffs and also procs from my weapons.  Dex helps, Agi is ok.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I hate to call you on this but do you have parses to prove it? I would be willing to bet you dont.. why you ask? because its been parsed before and found that DEX has no effect on your hit/miss percentage.<br />
<br />
My rogue runs with DEX anywhere from 175 in resist gear up to 260 with Shaman buffs and my hit percentage for both regular attacks and backstabs stays consistant (~60 percent hit for those curious) regardless of my DEX.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You sure about this?  You could be right, hell I was making an assumption, but I know I miss a lot more with my 16 skill fists than my 250 skill weapons.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gimmel</div><div class="date">05-27-2003, 09:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Weaponskill affects hit/miss ratio (and max hit), and weaponskill also affects the displayed ATK, so in that very limited sense, hit/miss ratio and ATK are related.<br />
<br />
ATK is a wierd composite mishmash of numbers that by itself doesn't mean much. Weaponskill, offense, str, and ATK buffs all affect your displayed ATK, but seem to do very different things to the way you deal damage. Raising ATK by raising STR, and raising it with an ATK buff is not the same thing.<br />
<br />
But, assuming maxed offense and weaponskills, ATK appears to have nothing to do with hit/miss ratio.</div></div><hr />
