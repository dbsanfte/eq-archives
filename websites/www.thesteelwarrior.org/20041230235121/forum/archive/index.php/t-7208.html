<br />
I've recently been re-thinking my gear and wondered just how important agi and dex are?  At one point in time I had my dex to 220 unbuffed, but changed that because with NDT I'm maxed anyways.  With my Healthy proc from the greaves my STA is maxed, STR is always maxed, so I've got some gear with lousy HP/AC but +15 to dex and agi to build those stats.  Is it worth it?  <br />
<br />
Also is expensive gear with + atk and regen worth it?  I had regen to 20 and Vengence 14 but I started selling the expensive gear with + atk and reg in order to get my BoC.  I'm thinking of continuing with that theory and swapping the turtle belt for something with better AC and HP.  Here's my magelo thanks in advance for any tips or advice.<br />

keep in mind I don't tank raids, I mostly do xp groups in the planes and some LDoN's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">05-18-2004, 10:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Agi adds a small amount of AC, and is only usefull for that.  Dex for procs obviously.  I would certainly prioritize both of those behind AC and HP's.  Note also that all 4 melee stats(str, sta, agi and dex) are used to figure your endurence, so are nice to have high for that.  As far as + attack and + regen items, to me they are a bonus, but I would choose a piece of gear for either(+ attack maybe a little to be honest, doing more damage is always nice).  And yes, I would swap the belt out for one with more AC or hp's.</div></div><hr />

STA means more hp make sure your max with buffs<br />
AGI means more AC but the return is TINY per agi, don't lose any sleep over it<br />
STR contributes to atk which means more dps, good for exp groups i supose<br />

always see your friendly shaman when you exp is the best advice i supose<br />

after you can get max in at least STA and DEX with buffs worry about your raw HP and AC.....regen is for the necros and atk is for the rng/mnk/rog  ;)</div></div><hr />

Don't worry about anything but ac and hps, if you raise those up as high as you can your other stats will be fine with buffs.</div></div><hr />

I would seriously NEVER worry about them on gear. Dex is the most useful after sta, and str is basically always capped from warrior gear of any sort. All you need to worry about is maxing your unbuffed sta, and then just getting hp/ac gear. Attack and regen are more useful than stats, but less useful than hp/ac.</div></div><hr />

Try to maximize AC and HPs (make sure stamina is maxed with Boar).<br />

People over prioritize dexterity,  it doesn't add much more than maybe .001 ppm.<br />

The only reason to raise stats is for the added endurance you will recieve from having the stats maxed out, other than that, go for hp/ac over everything else.<br />

Not on weapons thought, but since you have a BoC, I'm going to assume you already knew that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why hasn't anyone mentioned resists??<br />
<br />
Sure, all those stats are great to have and all, but for warriors, just about anything I've seen that would go to a warrior has tons of AC/HPs along with the other respective stats like dex, sta etc. . .<br />
<br />
Some of the AE's I've seen require your resistances to be over 250 unbuffed (in some cases 269 I believe)<br />
<br />
Resistances are the biggest stat I've noticed to be overlooked, both from the person that designed the armor sets and the players who use them.<br />
<br />
Heck, I've even heard mutterings of guild warriors using whatever extra AA's they can muster to put into resistances.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">05-20-2004, 12:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Resists aren't really important for the warrior that's always the main tank.  You can in theory have very bad resists and still get a bard to cover you with Psalm of Veeshan, not that it's even possible to have low resists and be a high end gear just due to itemization.<br />
<br />
As for resists in general, it really depends on what you're fighting.  Most stuff pre GoD don't really need resists anymore just because AE heals can cover for a good portion of them already.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">05-20-2004, 08:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">On the resists, it seems to me that it depends on a series of variables: your level, mob's level, mob's magic, whether you are in a raid/group/single partner/solo situation, whether there's a bard around, who is doing the healing, whether you are MT or not.<br />
I've never seen any logs from experiments where two non-MT warriors, one with high resists and one with (for the purposes of the experiment) low resists record the respective damage taken over fights with different mobs.<br />
In a lot of situations, the question is moot, really, because the AE healing and bard resist songs are going to be happening anyway and when things go right they take care of the damage. When things go wrong, heh, it's usually not because the third tank is taking too much magic damage.<br />
The relative importance of MR varies depending on your situation. If you are lvl 65 with tons of AAs and have had max resists for a year and a half, then you have one view. If at the moment you're lvl 50, and you are feared and headed for Vox's pits, you might have a different view of the matter, heh.</div></div><hr />

Yesterday some people started a semi open Greig raid and I got to be MT. Clearing his guards took time, we had a druid kite them while another person tagged 1 or 2 and pulled them out of his room. Anyway after some deaths and one wipe (we were less than 2 groups, 1 cleric, 2 druids and no bard) when we engaged Grieg it became clear to me that my resists even at 150'ish unbuffed are really sucks. He was keeping me almost perma blind and his AE + dd proc were doing quite some damage. We fought him for 15-20 minutes or so and brought him down to 50%. Being blind I was depending upon the stereo sound from the headphones to get an idea which direction to face, it kept working until I think I went OOR cause his proc has knockback effect too and I was usually perma blind. When I went down we wiped. And Greig is a Luclin mob.</div></div><hr />

<br />
  Well, that's true... sort of. I NEED my buff slots on a raid. Therefore, maxing sta unbuffed is very useful, as it basically creates another buff slot opening. Str/dex is easier, because you're going to have focus up anyways. VQ/SoV give some agi/dex as well, but you want agi closer to 250 unbuffed so you don't need a direct agi buff to cap it. Less buffs required is VERY important for a raiding warrior.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When you spend half your time clicking off the crap to get what's good and still retain slots for HoT's and mob dots you'll realize just how true this statement is. Maxing atleast sta/str without buffs(or very close) is a good thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neksnappa</div><div class="date">05-25-2004, 08:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm seeing some incorrect stuff in this thread, mainly concerning dex and haste.<br />
<br />
Adding 100 dex gives you an extra .5ppm in primary, last I checked, so dex is worthwhile if you aren't capped and are having trouble with aggro.<br />
<br />
And haste is not the all-important aggro tool. Much more important are WA, procs, hate augs, incite, and above all, raiding/grouping with people who know how to play the game. If you have 0% haste, 100% haste, or are slowed by say 50%, you will still proc the same number of times per minute on average. So the only thing being hasted does is increase your dps... and if any of you feel that dps is what keeps a mob aggroed on you, you're a lost cause. If I were MTing a raid mob, and had to chose between my existing 30ac 75hp 41% haste belt, or another belt with 0 haste and an extra 10ac and 25hp, I would switch in a heartbeat. Wouldn't you?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shaiel</div><div class="date">05-25-2004, 08:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No.<br />
<br />
You get X amount of hate per swing you take, where X is scaled based upon the potential damage of that swing.  This accounts for the MAJORITY of your aggro.  Having haste increases the number of swings you take, but unlike procs, have no reverse effect, ie, doesn't reduce the amount of hate per swing.  Go augment a Fine Steel weapon with Anger III and go up against a high DPS, non-procing weapon and see if you can hold aggro.  <br />
<br />
Holding aggro against a mob when you're slowed is a complete bitch.  I don't care what your setup is.  With max offensive AA's, DBotW+EoE, 2 Anger3 augs, Raex BP, Symbol of the Planesmaster, I STILL will have a hard time/lose aggro if I'm slowed.  Giving up your worn haste for 10ac, 25hp is the worst thing you could do.<br />
<br />
Procs are great ways to increase your aggro.  The potential damage per swing * number of swings you do is your aggro base which the procs build upon .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daabu</div><div class="date">05-25-2004, 08:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The potential damage per swing * number of swings you do is your aggro base which the procs build upon .<br />
Bingo.  In other words: <br />
<br />
Hate = MaxWpnDmg*Haste + Procs<br />
<br />
Proccing and incite add constant values.  Haste adds linearly (linear &gt; constant).<br />
<br />
The haste cap has been shown to be at 105%, although there is a lot of debate over how important that last 5% is.  Me personally, I'm not taking any chances.<br />
<br />
With a 31% Haste + VQ, you are 6% slower than the cap.  It's not a huge difference, probably not something you'll be able to notice without a parse or test, but if you had a 36% haste item there WOULD be a difference in your aggro.  It probably isnt a big enough difference to lose sleep over, though (if you really want to &quot;max&quot; your haste cap, you can get a 36% haste augment in LDoN...type 7, fits on like 5 different slots -- cap, gloves?, belt, back...something like that)</div></div><hr />

Cool, Thanks for all the tips!  I think I might do that after I get my Anger 3.  I missed out on the Fabled sash, camps were too long.  But I'd love to aug a decent piece of gear with haste.</div></div><hr />

So what you are saying is that a weapon with X dps but no aggro proc would be better than an aggro proc weapon with .8X dps or so? If this is the case, why does every single experienced warrior recommend getting a weapon with an innate hate proc to aug with anger/ykesha, rather than a high dps weapon w/o an aggro proc?<br />
<br />
Basically, according to your posts, would a 41/31 75dd be better aggro than a 31/30 with a stun proc, if neither are augmented? The 41/31 would do far and away more damage, and therefor more aggro?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shaiel</div><div class="date">05-25-2004, 01:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">.8X without knowing the &quot;aggro&quot; proc is in the grey area.  The example I used was a Fine Steel weapon, to get rid of that grey area.  But yes, a 41/31 innate 75dd would be much better aggro than a 31/30 with innate stun proc, with or without augments.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daabu</div><div class="date">05-25-2004, 02:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is, of course, a gray area, as Shaiel has stated.  I agree with him 100% on the 41/31 vs 31/30<br />
<br />
Now, if you were comparing a 34/31 vs a 31/31 + hate proc, it would be a gray area.<br />
<br />
<br />
If this is the case, why does every single experienced warrior recommend getting a weapon with an innate hate proc to aug with anger/ykesha, rather than a high dps weapon w/o an aggro proc?<br />
<br />
This is sort of a gray area here.  Lots of tanks get Quarm hammer for their offhand.  There is no innate proc here.  Lots of tanks also get a SEWS or a VDD -- these also do not have innate hate procs (Rune does build hate, but it is definately not Enraging Blow.  VDD's ac debuff also builds hate, but it is not the same as EB or Anger).  What makes these weapons viable choices is their high DPS coupled with their &quot;decent&quot; aggro procs.  <br />
<br />
I know warriors who have the Sparkling Short Sword from PoAir (14/18 +4magicdmg), slapped an anger3 aug on it, and they do just fine with it.<br />
<br />
DPS builds lots of aggro.  DPS builds more aggro than aggro procs will.  Aggro procs, though, can help make up for lost dps...if you have a weapon with 90dps and Enraging Blow, it will outaggro a weapon with 100dps, but it most likely will not outaggro a weapon with 150dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neksnappa</div><div class="date">05-25-2004, 05:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So unauged GSot4W &gt; unauged GSoT for purely aggro purposes? Sorry guys, but that is wrong. DPS and potential dmg per swing do generate aggro, but not enough to compensate for stun/debuff/+hate procs. Other than you two, every single warrior who knows the game that I have ever spoken to or read a post of theirs or anything, all disagree with you. Until I see some sort of test showing that dps and/or potential damage per swing (which are really the same thing) generate more aggro than good procs, I'm going to stick with the anger augs over the pure dd, the poorer ratio weapons rather than windblade/SBoD/etc that dont have innate procs.<br />
<br />
DPS and potential swing dmg are pretty much the same thing, they only measure damage output in different ways. If someone's DPS is twice as much as yours, and their weapons are the same delay, and things like skills and attack are equal, then their potential damage per swing is twice as high. If their delay is half of yours, but their dps is twice as much, then their hate/swing is one half what yours is, but they swing twice as often. If all of this stuff held true, which you two insist it does, then rogues would be the tanks of EQ. If a 41/31 75dd proc generates so much more dmg/swing aggro than a GSoT that the stun proc isn't enough to compensate, then how is it physically possible to hold aggro from a rogue doing 2+ times as much melee damage as you are? The answer is that if your potential dmg per swing is X damage, it doesn't even come close to generating X aggro. Each swing has a tiny bit of aggro, reguardless of damage, and then extra aggro is added depending on the potential damage. But each swing of a weapon with potential dmg/swing of 400 does NOT generate 400 aggro per swing. Or 200. Or 100. It's a very small amount, though I know of no parses showing exactly how much it is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
  Just a small thing, but half of rogue damage or so comes from backstab, which very likely uses different aggro rules. Same thing with mana burn and some other abilities.<br />
<br />
 There was some extensive testing on aggro per swing, though I don't have time to look for the thread atm. It's probably in the library. There is a formula that seems to work quite well, though I didn't focus on that thread when it was heavily active.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">05-25-2004, 07:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Neksnappa, I'm not sure why you have so much trouble imagining that a weapon could have enough DPS advantage to overcome its weaker proc aggro.  The blade of war does as well as it does because of its DPS aggro.  In terms of procs, it has nothing over the blade of carnage.<br />
<br />
The greatstaff of the four winds has a proc modifier working in its favor, and also has one of the highest &quot;damage bonus per second&quot;, like the blade of war, which is clearly an important component of the blade of war's aggro.  It is not a low aggro weapon, and I cringe everytime someone suggests putting yak on it &quot;for DPS purposes&quot;.<br />
<br />
Admittedly, the importance of &quot;DPS aggro&quot; has gone down in this age of Weapon Affinity 5.  The contribution of procs to total aggro has increased a lot thanks to this AA.  Despite that, I think you underestimate the aggro production from simply swinging a weapon.<br />
<br />
I have a hard time believing that a GSOT has a large aggro advantage over a GSOFW.  The GSOFW got me into aggro trouble too many times for me to agree that it is a low-aggro weapon.  I'm not in a position to perform a definitive test of the two weapons to back up my words, unfortunately.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neksnappa</div><div class="date">05-25-2004, 09:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't deny that a weapon could have such a better ratio than another with an aggro proc to be overall better aggro. However, I think that a weapon must have a much much better ratio/dps in order to do this, not just a few more points of damage. As far as procs go, straight dd procs are nil for aggro, it's been parsed numerous times. They add some, but it's a very very small amount. Through my own personal experience, as well as the experience of numerous other warriors I know or have talked to, switching from a 41/31 75dd proc weapon to a 31/30 stun proc weapon was a noticeable increase in overall aggro. For one thing, I duo with my shaman often, and while using a GSot4W I lose aggro fairly often if the shammie has stacked DOTs on the mob, even though I'm doing more overall damage on my warrior. Using droga weapons, a GSoT, or my current OSoW/CHSD combos, I not only can keep aggro through slow/debuff, I have NEVER lost aggro to my shaman due to a DOT while grinding over 50 aa. NEVER. With a GSot4W, it happens, albeit rarely.<br />
<br />
While raiding, and not the MT, I use my GSot4W. Why? Because in literally hundreds of raids, I can count on two hands how many times I've stolen aggro after the MA has called assist. If I use a GSoT, droga weapons, etc etc, I rarely steal aggro, but it happens much more often than with the GSot4W. Maybe mobs respond differently to large spikes in aggro (via proc weapon) versus steadier aggro (straight dps). I dont know. But I do know that in my experience, dps is very far behind procs when looking at the aggro of a weapon.<br />
<br />
I read through the thread in the library about hate per swing, and the initial post/parse definitely was not 100% correct/accurate/whatever. It's been stated by sony that using only a +hate spell/ability prior to doing any damage to a mob generates much less aggro than the spell/ability normally should. So casting 2 510 hate spells to aggro a mob would not give the SK 1020 aggro. <br />
<br />
Let's say we use the math in the thread though. According to the original post, 1 swing of a 28/28 generated about 45 aggro in primary. So let's say you swing the SEM twice per round on average, for a period of 1 minute, without haste. This should generate about 1935 aggro. Now, suppose you had a theoretical 8/20 weapon with a stun proc. According to the math, the 8/20 dps alone would generate 1500 aggro. You also average 2 procs per minute, so add the ~900 hate from 2 stun procs, and there's a total of 2400 aggro. So an 8/20 stun weapon generates 120% of the aggro a 28/28 noproc weapon does. So how would a 41/31 75dd weapon be better than a 31/30 with a stun? The ratio on the GSot4W is 1.32, and the GSoT is 1.03. So the GSot4W has a ratio around 128% better than the GSoT. Now, let's compare the 1handers: 28/28 is a 1 ratio. 8/20 is a .4 ratio. The SEM has a ratio 250% better than that of the imaginary 8/20 stun weap, but still gets owned. <br />
<br />
I still say GSoT &gt; GSot4W for aggro. Feel free to disagree, but until I see some solid parces, I'm gonna go with aggro weapons over a Windblade, thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daabu</div><div class="date">05-25-2004, 11:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pure DD &lt; Stun proc.  Yes, we know that.  Because procs are a set rate per minute, 150dd does not amount to a 75dd + stun.  That isnt the point.<br />
<br />
The question is how much damage is needed to overwrite a stun proc or a hate proc.<br />
<br />
You stick anger3 on a gso4w, and an anger3 on a gsot, and had the two go toe to toe on aggro, you will definately steal aggro with a gso4w.  Maybe you wont tank as much overall, but you will steal aggro a few times at least.<br />
<br />
Part of this problem is with the RNG.  You are at the whim of your RND seed while relying on procs for hate.  Using a dps weapon, you are not...because it is set aggro per swing.  On the other hand, though, using a proc is burst aggro -- three quick procs give you a big chunk of aggro that may take a bit longer for the dps combination to catch up to -- but no procs in a minute will cause you to fall far behind.<br />
<br />
I admit I have never run a test on aggro between those two specific weapons...but experience has shown me on raids that a high dps weapon can and does steal aggro from a lower dps proc weapon.  My theory is that it has to do with the RNG...and that relying on more on swings/dps &gt; relying on procs, because you aren't relying on the dps.<br />
<br />
Either way, though, I still contest that a high-DPS, less-Proc weapon is more reliable than a low-DPS, more-Proc weapon.  My new SEWS+Anger3 that holds aggro better than my BoC+Anger3 / RottingFist+Ykesha supports my argument.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neksnappa</div><div class="date">05-26-2004, 08:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, if you don't get procs for a minute, you are essentially a low-dps tank competing with high-dps group/raid members. With 2 weapons with innate aggro procs, 2 augments, some WA, and a good level of dex, you'll average one proc every 5 seconds. The odds of not procing for 30 seconds, let alone 1 minute, are slim. The chances of not getting double attack, flurry, ripostes, etc etc for that length of time are also slim, but it also can happen.<br />
<br />
And if you use a GSot4W with A3, and I use a GSoT with A3, I will most likely tank more often, if the RNG doesn't flip out. Yes, if you get 2 A3 procs back to back, you might steal aggro briefly. But if I end up tanking for the majority of the time, you know what that means? GSot + A3 &gt; GSot4W + A3.<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: Just to prevent an endless argument, I'm gonna say that sure, a high dps weapon with an anger proc might hold great aggro for some of you out there. Myself, I have not seen this work, but of course that doesn't mean it can't. I'm done bickering back and forth over what is better aggro. I use as many aggro procs as I can get, and rely on them for aggro. I don't have any problems with this method. I suggest to everyone out there who doesn't know which way to go to try both ways and go with what works for you.<br />
<br />
Back to my original post, and what sparked this whole thing: If I take off my haste item, my overall aggro does not suffer significantly, because I still proc as often, and procs account for the vast majority of my aggro. Of course if you rely on dps, taking off a haste item would be very counter-productive.</div></div><hr />

I have to disagree.  I've fought many times for 30 seconds without getting a proc.  Half the time you are fighting, you are going to proc less than average.  With WA5 and 4 procs on your weapons, you do average one proc every 6 seconds, but by no means can you expect that to be the case every time.<br />
<br />
While tanking, you want the most aggro as you can get as quick as you can.  DPS will get your more aggro in the first round than a proc weapon.  DPS will be more reliable throughout an entire fight than dual wielding proc weapons will be.  Don't believe me?  Try it.  I used a BoC+Anger3 and the rotting fist+Ykesha.  Now I use a SEWS+Anger3.  I have 1 hate proc instead of 3 hate procs, and yet somehow I manage to keep aggro!!!</div></div><hr />

The thread in the library was hardly conclusive on this subject (and another thread that was in the bunker 2 months ago &quot;GSOT vs GSo4w&quot;.  They did prove &quot;potential agro&quot; for bane mobs.  You are exaggerating what was proven with your comments.<br />
<br />
1. DPS builds lots of agro: the formula this statement is based on is suspect.  There are some base assumptions in it that are still just theory (which I asked to be elaborated on at that time and the poster (an SK?) chose not to).<br />
<br />
2. DPS builds more aggro than procs will: really have never seen any empirical test to back this up.  As such this is a subjective statement.<br />

I'm not saying that potentailly you are right (pun intended)...merely trying to prevent group think from taking over and stating something as a proven fact which really is still only half theory.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. You can lose aggro to somebody who has no aggro procs, even while you are using multiple aggro procs.  Try going to LDoN with a time equipped rogue or monk, and holding aggro using a BoC.  It's not easy, and there is a reason for this.<br />
<br />
2. Using a BoC+Anger3, you can lose aggro to a warrior using a DPS weapon, especially if he has more offensive AAs.<br />
<br />
3. Try sticking anger3 on a low damage weapon, like a FS longsword.  See how you hold aggro with that.<br />
<br />
4. Using furious with a high dps weapon in your main hand builds substantially more aggro than using furious with a low dps weapon that procs.  This is self-evident.<br />
<br />
5. Warriors were capable of holding aggro in the Kunark era (although paladins were admitadly better), even without using hate procs (the only one that existed was the epic, if I recall).  I used a Jade Mace (9dmg 18dly) before my epics, and I was able to hold aggro just fine--because it was a high dps weapon (for the time)</div></div><hr />

Taunt is what keeps us on top.  Their DPS &gt; our DPS, therefore they have slightly more aggro.  We taunt, we get the advantage, and then it starts slipping slowly away again.  I really highly doubt that DPS aggro is as significant as is being claimed in this thread.  <br />

<br />
I am not contesting that dps agro is consistent<br />
I am not contesting that dps agro exists.<br />
I am not contesting that folks shouldnt try to get decent dps weaps as long as they are COMBINED with some kind of agro proc.<br />
<br />
What I am saying:<br />
<br />
- What MATTERS is the difference/delta in agro generation between classes.<br />
<br />
- That dps agro (as Haass just pointed out) is NOT A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENTIATING FACTOR IN AGRO BETWEEN WARRS AND OTHER CLASSES. In most cases we have an UNFAVORABLE delta with other classes for dps.<br />
<br />
- That procs ARE a significant differentiating factor (in particular anger) as warrs have an inherent advantage in their weap selection.</div></div><hr />

You can combine ANY dps weapon with Anger3 and it will be better than a crappy dps weapon with an aggro proc and anger3.<br />
<br />
In other words, putting anger3 on a GSot4W *will* hold significant aggro...and probably will net more positive results tanking than going double droga weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">05-27-2004, 10:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lol, this post is completely derailed.<br />
The answer to the orginal question is: Yeah, stats matter, just not as much as AC and hitpoints.<br />
As has been pointed out, better AC and hitpoint gear will, over the long run, tend to get your stats up too.<br />
Before you max your stats out, getting more STA and DEX is always nice; that (and the high AC and hitpoints) are why FH and Tundra cultural armors have traditionally been so nice for the average 50-60+ warrior. There are also a number of slots (rings, earrings, maybe neck) where you aren't going to get a lot of AC anyway, but you can get pretty good stats from items that go there.<br />
Once those stats are maxxed, obviously, you'll tend to think about AC/hitpoints a lot more.<br />
Eventually, you also think about CHA because of DI, and because CHA is extremely difficult to max out.<br />
<br />
Now then, back to our regularly scheduled derail:<br />
I'm somewhat surprised that Varalla's GSot4W with an anger III aug would out-aggro a BoC with Anger II and a ChoS with Anger II.<br />
It seems to me that there are a huge number of variables here, including the make-up of the group(s) the warrior is fighting with, the warrior's AAs, and possibly differences in the mobs.<br />
Still, according to the following formulas (based on library thread):<br />
&quot;potential damage&quot; aggro generation for 1-hand weapons in the primary hand is:<br />
<br />
(damage + damage bonus + 1)/ delay<br />
 and <br />
<br />
and for 2-hand weapon the &quot;potential damage&quot; agro generation is:<br />
<br />
(damage + 2H damage bonus + 1H damage bonus)/delay<br />
<br />
So: BoC = (15+13+1)/20 = 1.45 &quot;potential damage&quot; hate rate.<br />
and: GSot4W = (41+36+ 13)/31 = 2.90<br />
<br />
The &quot;potential damage&quot; hate generated by a mainhand BoC is exactly half the &quot;potential damage&quot; hate as the GSo4W (assuming the library thread is even a rough estimate of how these things work).<br />
The GSot4Ws also has eh, lightening surge (-75 hps) innate proc and the Anger III aug.<br />
so that means that (half the &quot;potential damage&quot; of the GSot4Ws) + Anger III + lightening surge (at whatever rate these procs happen to fire) &gt; the BoC innate proc of 700 hate + Anger II (mainhand proc rate) + Anger II (offhand proc rate) + CHoS's offhand &quot;potential damage&quot; + CHoS's innate proc (offhand proc rate).<br />
<br />
Or, if we subtract the CHoS's offhand &quot;potential damage&quot; rate of hate from 1/2 of the GSot4W's &quot;potential damage&quot;:<br />
[(1/2 of the GSot4W's hate from potential damage)- (the CHoS's offhand potential damage hate)] &gt; {[ BoC's innate proc + mainhand Anger II + ChoS innate proc (offhand rate) + Anger II (offhand rate)] - [Anger III + lightening surge]}<br />
<br />
I'm still surprised that the GSot4W+ Anger III outaggros BoC + Anger II and ChoS + Anger II. I'm very surprised that this aggro advantage would be so large that it was obvious with no controled tests.<br />
But, even if I give Varalla the benefit of the doubt (why shouldn't I, after all, since I haven't used these weapons in this configuration, and Varalla has) I'm still not convinced that the GSo4W's &quot;potential damage&quot; hate that is left over after you subtract the &quot;potential damage&quot; hate of the BoC+ ChoS is the deciding factor here.<br />
I'd be interested to see what would happen if the BoC were aug'd with Anger III, because the GSot4Ws is pretty much maxxed out for it's potential hate with the Anger III, but the BoC/CHoS set up could still be improved with Anger III.<br />
<br />
Given the number of variables here, I'm not sure how you could avoid comparing a bunch of apples to a bunch of oranges, some watermelons and a kitchen sink in this equation, let alone eliminate all variables from in-game fight situations.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's because it's not.  A lot of people say a lot of things, and when you put them in a statement like this, it becomes obvious that not all of them are true.<br />
<br />
1 anger 3 proc every 30 seconds isn't even gong to begin to come close to the aggro generated by 2 augged droga weapons.  Not even close.  And DPS isn't going to make up the difference, no matter what anyone here would have you believe.<br />
<br />
In other words, putting anger3 on a GSot4W *will* hold significant aggro...and probably will net more positive results tanking than going double droga weapons. <br />
<br />
This is crap too, because if you had a greatstaff of the four winds, and had droga weapons, and you put your anger augment on the greatstaff, you would have SIGNIFICANTLY less aggro than having the anger on your mainhand weapon of your dual wield setup.  I'm not sure why this point is still being disputed, because it's quite frankly, ridiculous.  The Greatstaff WILL NOT outdamage the droga weapons by such a margin as to overcome 3 stun procs per minute.  <br />
<br />
Seriously guys, this theory you have falls apart in the face of logic, and you don't have any facts to prove anything. All you have is a set of conclusions that were reached by somewhat questionable logic, and you're touting it as fact.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No...if you take a lvl 65 warr with no AA... no I don't think this will be true.  Maybe if you have the 2 handed AA skills and no dual wield this *could* become true but I rather doubt it.  4x proc droga weaps are significant agro to overcome.<br />
<br />
/shrug  My 4x proc mode (GBoS anger 3, CHSD anger2) &gt; agro than my GSo4w w/yak mod...purely subjective observation on my part but you guys seem rather fond of subjectivity in this thread.<br />
<br />
I'm curious: is this a crusade on a couple people's part to &quot;set the warrior world on its ear&quot; with the latest break through (DPS is the main source of agro)?  If so leave my suggestion in to leave this thread and go run some in-game tests (like Brutul did for taunt).  Nothing less than that is gonna take this into the land of facts and garner wide ranging acceptance.<br />
<br />
 Still, according to the following formulas (based on library thread):<br />
&quot;potential damage&quot; aggro generation for 1-hand weapons in the primary hand is:<br />
<br />
(damage + damage bonus + 1)/ delay<br />
and <br />
and for 2-hand weapon the &quot;potential damage&quot; agro generation is:<br />
(damage + 2H damage bonus + 1H damage bonus)/delay<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I still havent seen anything empirical that shows where those formulas are derived from.   I think the poster pulled in out of his arse.</div></div><hr />

An actual experiment in comparative aggro would end the debate.

I may spend a few k and run some tests.</div></div><hr />

Theory says that the droga weapons should be better. Observation shows that things are not so cut and dry. Most of those who have dismissed the argument have done so based on theory, not observation. <br />
<br />
And we've shown many, many times that observations are in fact, skewed by perception.<br />
<br />
There were countless threads in the bunker consisting of &quot;GSoT or CHoS/SoBS,&quot; and each time the same debate raged.  It's impossible for me, with my group, to compare how my weapons perform, compared to you, and your group.  What is cut and dry is the fact that I know how much hate I'm generating thru procs.  You know how much you're generating, and dual wield in this case has a rather large advantage there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have, and continue to, agree with this previous statement.  However, it is irrelevant to this discussion -- how much does a high damage weapon play into affect?  People with a BoW swear they get more aggro than a boc/chos.  I dont have a bow, but i have a sews, a boc, and a chos.<br />
<br />
Can anybody come up with a parsable scenario (that requires no work, or a lot of work) that we can compare how much aggro a given weapon generates through dps?<br />
<br />
I'm thinking:<br />
<br />
Pull with a given character, have them melee the mob until a round of damage lands in some way (throw, nuke, whatever)<br />
<br />
Have an SK taunt the mob until it successfully lands on him.<br />
<br />
Cast X hate spells to acquire X hate.<br />
<br />
Swing weapon until mob turns on you (procs that aren't X hate result in a failure)<br />
<br />
Division calculation to see how much hate is built up per swing<br />
<br />
The noticable difference between this idea and the previous is that you need a third party to initially damage the mob, because there is a theory that hate is screwey before damage is dealt.<br />
<br />
I would only be able to run this test if I had the help of friends, because I do not have access to a shadowknight account...although with EQWindow working again it may not be as hard for somebody to test.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts/suggestions on this test before somebody (either myself or someone else more capable) tries it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">05-27-2004, 03:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Flair, concerning where the formula's came from:<br />
http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=3789<br />
<br />
That's a really long thread and for most of it people are testing, guessing, re-testing in different ways. Essentially the &quot;testing&quot; involved casting a known amount of hate on a mob, then having a second character hit the mob with the weapon being tested until the mob turned on the the second character. The most obvious thing was that it didn't matter how many times a weapon missed the mob: the mob  turned on the same number of swings each time (with any given weapon), not on the same amount of damage--so, a weapon's aggro was clearly based on some sort of potential damage, and not actual damage. Then people spend a long time attempting to reverse engineer the formula to describe the way in which weapons of different dam/delays were behaving.<br />
The formulas I used above were presented in the thread; of several formulas suggested, these seemed to best fit the data. They were in fact off a little bit (&lt; 5%, if I recall); they're approximate, but came pretty close to predicting how many swings it would take with a given weapon to turn a mob given a set amount of hate.<br />
<br />
Of course when I say &quot;reverse engineer&quot; I mean &quot;to pull out of his arse&quot; (to borrow your phrase, Flair), because yeah, that's what reverse engineering is, sort of. But those formulas best explained/predicted the aggro behavor of the tested weapons in the confines of those experiments.<br />
<br />
Anyway, reverse engineering comparative formulas seems more promising than anecdotal evidence--and I have at least one bit of anecdotal evidence that suggests procs do make make a difference over pure dps. But that just doesn't convince me.<br />
You wouldn't believe how long I thought disarm generated some small but fixed amount aggro, lol. All because I could pull green mobs by standing next to them and disarming them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varalla</div><div class="date">05-27-2004, 05:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some of the factors are covered in my magelo.<br />
The zones are ususaly in LDoN Tak normal.<br />
My reg group is ususally me, 65 Cleric, 65 beastlord, 65 mage, 65 Ranger, and a 65 Necro. None of us are elemental flagged, but we have an unsusaly high amount of AA. The combat is ususally very very short depending on how many mobs we are charging.<br />
If we are charging one mob, I use incite. Sometimes incite is refreshed by next mob, sometimes it isnt.<br />
If we are doing multiple mobs the fights take longer as almost everyone can off tank except for the cleric.<br />
<br />
In lengthy fights both setups hold aggro fine.<br />
In the short ones the GSot4W holds, the DW setup is irratic.<br />
<br />
I might try Anger III on the BoC and see if it can compete, but Im not going to reaug the CHoS.<br />
<br />
If the combo doesnt cut it by then Ill cut me losses and try to resell.<br />
<br />
My observations ARE skewed by perception.<br />
I cant hold aggro with the current DW set up, but I can with my GSot4W.<br />
<br />
*Shrugs*<br />
<br />
I guess black is white :)<br />
<br />
But dude why would someone with full full full AAs give a crap about droga vs GSo4W?<br />
 Aggro.<br />
<br />
RE EDIT:<br />
<br />
NOPE!<br />
Had an interisting group with another warrior.<br />
Had a chanter and we were doing single pulls.<br />
GBoS Anger II / CHoS Anger II ping pongs against GSot4W (Favor GSot4W) for the first 30 to 40 seconds, DW then dominates.<br />
(Stomped him with BoC/CHoS though)<br />
<br />
Other warrior also was still working defensive AA's so the DW is probably scales even more against an equally AAed warrior.<br />
<br />
Think Ill keep my GSot4W for me ususal group and go with the DW set up for pickups and raid.</div></div><hr />

This has been the belief for ages now, and I have yet to see anything in this thread or in any other that can make me doubt this. If a certain weapon setup is doing more dps, then it's potential damage per swing is logically also higher. Nobody is saying that potential damage per swing is irrelevent, we're just saying it's not as important as a slew of aggro procs and WA.

<br />
If warriors had the option to equip dps weapons of the same tier as rogues and monks, and could then A3 those weapons and use taunt/incite, then sure, dps would be the way to go. But a warrior going for straight dps will be left in the dust by any other melee class doing more dps.<br />
<br />
According to the equations in the other thread, an 8/20 will generate 1500 aggro based on pure dps in 1 minute. A 28/28 will generate 1935. So if the 8/20 has an innate aggro proc, and an anger aug, how can anyone here say that it will not be more aggro than the 28/28 with only 1 aggro proc?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">05-27-2004, 10:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nothing ever seems &quot;cut and dried&quot; when you talk about aggro.I've got warriors in my guild who will at times draw aggro from me with a3 auged dps one handers and unauged lower content aggro weapons.This is true whether I'm using my a3 BOW or a3Bf/a3BOC.Aggro is always subject to luck.With a little care and effort I can keep aggro on myself pretty well.Warriors are used to maximizing a lot of little variables in their favor to produce good aggro hold.These variables along with luck in procs can easily skew perspective.<br />
<br />
Will an unauged gsot4w produce more aggro than an unauged BOC/CHOS combo?<br />
I doubt it.Of course the gsot4w would at times pull aggro like any other comparable weapon if left to it's own device.That's just luck.This board has generally had the opinion for a long time that a BoC and insert CHSD/GBOS/CHOS etc. combo has better innate aggro than a gsot4w.The advent of a3 augs does nothing to change this.The augs improve each weapons aggro output by the same amount.<br />
<br />
Varalla,in her last edit did say her BOC/CHOS &quot;stomped&quot; the other warrior's set up where her gsot4w ponged aggro initially, losing it over time.Such a result is what most of us would expect I think.I like my BOW on fast breaks as well.Less chanters seem to die than with my dual wield setup hehe.<br />
<br />
I've never had a gsot4w.I had a monk friend who used to use his(he had some offensive aa I had none) when I used a CHOS/SOTB &amp; CHSD/CHOS.Despite his outdamaging me by far aggro was pretty easy for me.When he and other guildies used their CHOS in mainhand it was more of a problem for me.I remember the solid snap turn I could get on a mob when that CHOS procced.The proc was everything and made my job a lot easier.I doubt the 75dd and improved dps on the gsot4w is as effective as 2 droga stun procs.With taunt and positioning it might seem so at times tho.<br />
<br />
I think an a3 auged gsot4w is enough aggro for a lot of people in alot of places,,,but they could usually do better imo /shrug.And the key is the a3 aug not the staff.My friend tanks fine on raids with a3 auged dps onehanders.However, his aggro is noticably weaker than mine and he's a hard working tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">05-28-2004, 07:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree completely w/ Neksnappa here:<br />
&quot;So according to Var's observations, pure dps is better until the DW gets a few procs, at which point the aggro proc weapons lock aggro.

<br />
And Var's latest comments seem quite reasonable to me too (heh, which only means they fit the ideas I happen to have in my head, lol).<br />
<br />
A while ago, one of my toons, who I believe was a 50 or 51 warrior at the time (at any rate, no offensive AAs at all) was messing around with a cleric and ranger after whacking some sort of epic mob or other. We decided to hang out after the fight and work on various skills with some blue mobs running around. The cleric was, I believe, 56 or so. Like all clerics, she wanted to max her offensive skills (lol). So the ranger was pulling, I was tagging mob with arrow (outdoor zone) then provoking mob, then engaging with (an un-aug'd) WMBS. The ranger was doing something or other to control his aggro. The cleric was using a CHoS (dunno if aug'd or not). I'm not entirely sure the cleric was casting no other spells, but at the start of the fight, I'd have aggro with the WMBS. But the mob very often jumped the cleric when the CHoS proc'd. Either the ranger or I would have to taunt and/or provoke again to get aggro back, which would fit with the idea that the potential dps of the WMBS was generating early and steady aggro that exceeded the CHoS--until the CHoS proc'd, at which point there was a high possibility of me losing aggro (to a cleric!). Obviously, since I'm not sure whether cleric was casting other spells, and I certainly did not log this magnificent display of me losing melee aggro to a cleric, this is purely annecdotal.<br />
<br />
It's possible that an aug'd dps weapon might be a reasonable choice when, as Var points out, you know that the fight is going to last a very short time, since until the RNG decides to smile on the DW set up, a really good dps 2-hander will have the aggro advantage. Obviously, early procs on the DW would really lock down aggro, but those fights would be balanced by some number where the DW didn't fire off for a while. And of course, an Anger III proc on the dps weapon is nothing to sneeze at.<br />
<br />
Clearly the effectiveness of this strategy depends on the relative quaility of the weapon set ups, the warrior's AAs, the augs, the mobs and the dps/hate being generated by the rest of the group.</div></div><hr />

Three words --<br />
<br />
Gnoll Hide Lariat.<br />
<br />
There are very few weapons in the game with less DPS, and none that I know of that have been used to tank uber mobs, and yet they hold their own against very high DPS weapons from Velious and Luclin, and WILL hold aggro.  Frodlin and others have used them to great success to tank uber mobs simply with the stun.  There is next to zero DPS in this equation, much like your fine steel long sword analogy Daabu, and yet they STILL hold aggro over weapons with 1/1 ratios easily.  <br />
<br />
Actual DPS does indeed have a bearing on aggro, but it is nowhere near the value of hate and hate producing procs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have no idea how much better aggro is on other weapons, only what i've used. <br />
<br />
These I am sure of:<br />
<br />
1) Duel weild has a much higher potential for aggro.  Given the augs and the new weapon affinity, I can say for SURE BoC A3'd/ GBoS A3'd is far far better at creating aggro vs my BoW A3'd. <br />
<br />
2) I never knew that far as DPS of a weapon goes, weapons were based off of potential damage vice actual damage.  But it concurrs with my observations on the two aggros.  Higher DPS less aggro proc weapons have a much smoother aggro build.  Lower DPS but more aggro procs will create better aggro, in a more random pattern.<br />
<br />
<br />
One thing thats obvious from that statement is that DPS has a definate part in aggro, but procs in the long run are your better friends.<br />
<br />
My observations come from hunting with slowers, as slowing has a nice aggro built to it, you can compare everytime you have a new mob, as things change slightly.</div></div><hr />

Far as wording i'll admit its not what I made it sound.  If you want to know my opinion, I much prefer the BoW, I wanted to merely explain that duel weild is &gt; than 2h aggro wise over a period of time.<br />
<br />
Far as slowing, timing is one consideration you have think about, but thats not 100% true.  If player A pulls Mob A, you hit incite, and at this point shaman casts slow, after one round of attack from my BoW slow lands on mob.  Its this point that you determine how good the aggro of a weapon is because usually if a shaman slows too soon, they will pull aggro, or if resist and they recast slow soon as gem pops up again more than likely they'll have aggro.  Depending on when the anger/eb proc goes off, and how much time has pass, over many days of even casual observation you can come up with a conclusion that will conurr with any parse type studies.  BoW has a definate more smooth aggro build, and by no means inferior compared to other combos available, however BoW vs  duel weild combo that I presented,  the results are obvious.</div></div><hr />

Far as variance in aggro in my opinion is not substantial enough to make duel weild 2 fast swingers better than a BoW.  You obviously know about riposte and all that, so not gonna get into that, but the amount of controlled damage you take far outweighs the aggro that BF/BoC will provide, now if that BoC was actually spelled DBotW, then yeah your aggro is higher and duel weild is worth it in many situations, but your still swinging a fast off hand, but 2h will always be better as long as only the number hungry wizards die.</div></div><hr />

Sorry that was what I meant, when you have to choose between actual tank weapons, not some random 1h/2h .  The riposte reduction is almost always worth the lesser potential aggro vs equal era duel weild combo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, this is completely false as well.  The amount of ripostes you gain by switching to dual wield is largely unimportant when compared to the aggro boost gained by almost doubling your procs per minute.  <br />
<br />
You are free to believe your statement, but it is far from fact.  It doesn't matter how many ripostes you're taking if the mob is kiling clerics or wizards.</div></div><hr />

BoW has more than enough aggro to do the job, without as much damage spikes.  <br />
<br />
Not only that, you do NOT double your aggro from procs, you show me proper math equation to prove me wrong, and I will back down. Only 1h that would apply is DB, which doesn't summarize duel weild combinations.  I would STILL not duel weild with DB when the mobs i'm supposed to tank hit for many Ks.  So you can tell me my facts are far from truth, but many DB users use a shield in off hand, not an EoE or clone. Which esentially makes it like a 2h with only one weapon attacking per round.</div></div><hr />

So a BOW is good aggro for a pre-time guild.I've heard auged SEWS and eventually VDD are good choices as well.I don't think there are too many other options that I would take for 2-handers over dual wielding EB weapons even on hard hitters.In fact I'd probably only use the BOW  with my BF/BOC sitting in my bags.Atm I feel I lose a little aggro over time and gain a lil better survivability with the BOW.The differances in my mind are small enough that except on a few mobs they're pretty equal choices(BOW vs BF/BOC).<br />

Suggesting 2h is always better(even with the wizard qualifier) and that an a3 BOW is far,far less aggro than an a3 BOC/GBOS has prompted some posts in reply.My post was related to my aggro paranoia that i've kept since my langseax days.However, you seem to have aroused Haass...I advise caution. ;)</div></div><hr />

Your HP goes down, and your HP goes up, thats the life of a tank.  How much it can fluctuate can mean the difference between surviving and not surviving.  I never stated you can't tank unless you have a 2hander, its better, and I will continue to believe that, and so will many others because having a smoother fluctuation of hp increases our chance to do our job better.<br />
<br />
By no stretch of imagination is BoW and later, low aggro.  So don't even tell me that raids wipe because BoWs suck at aggro, or even a A3'd SEWS.  They are perfectly acceptable MA weapons, and I believe them better than duel weilding two 20 delay weapons simply because it produces MORE aggro, while taking a &quot;couple&quot; riposte per minute. If you could ONLY take riposte, according to your statement, every 30 seconds, then yeah no biggie.  Either you've never duel weilded pre-BoW weapons, or you started out with a DBotW, cuz I can assure you BF/BoC/GBoS/CHSD etc can and will result in deaths on more than rare occasions BECAUSE of a bigger damage spike.<br />
<br />
Tell me thats wrong too.<br />

What kind of light bulb would you prefer?<br />

A) One that flickers between Very bright and Dim, but if you counted up the numbers, comes up higher than Bulb B<br />
<br />
B) Its mediocre in brightness, not Very bright, nor Not-so-Very Bright, and overall the number comes out lower, but its steady.</div></div><hr />

Well, i'm trying to figure out what the fuck this means, but if it means what I think it means, which is &quot;BoW and SeWS are more aggro than everything else&quot;, then yes, you're wrong.  The Bloodfrenzy and almost anything will beat those in sheer aggro.<br />
<br />
Did I say they suck at aggro?  No, I said that they're inferior to dual wielding, which is true.  Just because you prefer 2% less DPS by eliminating a few ripostes does not make it the only choice.  <br />
<br />
Spikes can kill you while you're using 2h too you know.  That's what DI is for.  If you're not lucky today, then it doesn't matter what you're holding in your hands, you're fucking dying.  I'm not arguing your preference, I'm arguing you stating your preference as fact.</div></div><hr />

You are free to believe your statement, but it is far from fact. It doesn't matter how many ripostes you're taking if the mob is kiling clerics or wizards.<br />

I would say, though, that in places like Ikkinz, I noticed a &quot;SUBSTANTIAL&quot; (as in, much more than 2%) increase in success rate when I got my SEWS.</div></div><hr />

The whole 2h weapon craze came about in PoP because they got a DPS boost and stuff was hitting incredibly hard compared to what people were used to in Luclin.  That extra riposte or two only mattered when people first start trying Fennin Ro when he could 1-round the tank.  Today, it's not nearly the issue it used to be.  Guilds who fight Fennin now have better tanks (tanks are also focused more towards AC than the HP heavy tanks coming out of Luclin).  Stuff in GoD hits so damn hard and fast anyways, if you're counting on your 2h to stop that killing riposte, you're screwed already.<br />
<br />
The glory-day of the 2h weapon came and went.  They're still very viable and in better shape than pre-PoP due to good weapons such as BoW, SEWS, and VDD, but 1h weapons are again/still the better route overall.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Alright, allow me to try again.<br />
<br />
It isn't a BETTER choice, it's YOUR choice.  This argument happens at all levels of the game.  Check the bunker...you'll find countless Copper Hammer/Sword of the Bloodsworn vs Greatstaff of Thunder threads.  These are not people who are tanking EP gods, some of these people have problems making it thru a normal LDoN mission, and they say the EXACT same shit you do.  2h does more DPS, 2h makes me live longer, blah blah blah.<br />
<br />
You know what, it works for them, that's fine.  Some people can't take ripostes from BoT nameds, or HoH, or hard LDoN or whatever the fuck they're doing, and they think that 2h increases their chances of survival.  Some people group with different people every day and their perceptions of weapon X working today but weapons Y and Z not working yesterday are very skewed. Some people prefer to just get Punishing Blade and call their DPS AA's good enough, so naturally they think that their DPS suffers when they switch to dual wield...they already assume it sucks, so they're going to focus on that and make themselves believe it does.<br />
<br />
But you wanna know what?  It's all perception, and very little of it has any real basis for argument.  Blade of war WILL produce less aggro than a bloodfrenzy or a Darkblade and an aggro offhand, just as a Greatstaff of Thunder will produce less aggro than droga weapons.  It's not open for fucking debate, we can see the procs, we know how much they go off, and the longer the fight goes on, the more advantage dual wield is going to have.  Ripostes are a SINGLE DIGIT amount of mob DPS, even dual wielding.  If you lose because of ripostes, chances are you're not geared to be doing that.  The DPS gap between 2h and dual wielding has grown VERY slim.  If you've got a decent 2h, you'd be surprised how much DPS you do with decent 1h's. <br />
<br />
I'll honestly never understand why some people will swear up and down that their 2h is better than anything they can get for 1h, when it's blatantly not true.  Maybe it's true if you got your Blade of War on a pickup raid and you've got 4khp and no money in the bank, but there's no other situation I can think of where that would happen.  I'll personally take dual wield, because more aggro procs = MORE AGGRO.  Period.  A few ripostes, even on an unslowable mob that hits near 1k isn't going to factor in to my decision.  Remember that the more aggro I have, the faster that shit can die, and the less likely the mob is going to live long enough for the RNG to generate a spike to kill me.<br />
<br />
You're free to use whatever you want.  If it works for you, that's fantastic, but don't make broad statements like &quot;2h is better&quot; when it's clearly not.  It's actually inferior to dual wielding in almost every case, you just CHOOSE to make the sacrifice because you think that ripostes are a significant source of damage.  If you pick that, that's fine, some people are trying to do BoT with 4khp, and I'll agree that ripostes are probably an issue for them.  But don't try to tell everyone else that it's the &quot;better&quot; choice.</div></div><hr />

I'm done trying to argue my point in this thread; if people continue to voice their *wrong* opinions, without looking at the numerous other posts proving them wrong, and without doing any parses themselves, then whatever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daabu</div><div class="date">05-31-2004, 04:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ripostes and DPS has nothing to do with the 2h vs DW argument.<br />
<br />
The argument is that with a DW, you have 3x the chance to get hit for 4x in that round, instead of 3x that round.<br />
<br />
Whenever you're fighting a mob that has a 2sec CH chain, you want to minimize ripostes.  Any mob that has the capability of one-rounding (or come painfully close to doing so), you want to minimize ripostes.  Theres no &quot;parses&quot; I can do to prove this to you, its JUST COMMON SENSE.  Yes, ripostes are a single diget percentage of overall dps, but that doesnt make them less of a big deal.  Mobs that hit hard will riposte hard, and if you're fighting with a Moss Covered Twig, you're asking to die.  <br />
<br />
DBoW is good to have because it has a low delay relatively speaking, and builds insane aggro.  There's no debating that.  But if you're fighting something that hits hard enough to deal 80%+ of your HP in one melee round, you better not be dual wielding 20dly weapons.  Its just common sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">05-31-2004, 11:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For fucks sake, do you not fucking listen?<br />
<br />
Parses on ripostes have been done.  The amount of damage added by dual wielding over using 2h is almost insignificant.<br />
<br />
Your common sense doesn't match raw data, and that's where the problem lies.  If you're so concerned about ripostes, then just turn off attack, then you won't get riposted at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daabu</div><div class="date">06-01-2004, 12:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You're a fucking retard, Haass (pardon my perpetuation of the word &quot;fuck&quot;, but I wanted to keep with the pattern!)<br />
<br />
Read what I said again.<br />
<br />
It has nothing to do with the percentage of damage.  It has to do with the chance of being riposted in general, and how that adds to the ROUND.  Not the overall fight, i couldnt care less about the overall fight.<br />
<br />
Even with a chance of being riposted sitting at 1.5% a round.  Using a 30dly 2hander over 10minutes (assuming unhasted for number's sake), you're looking at 200 rounds of attack, or 3 ripostes.<br />
<br />
Dual wielding 20dly weapons, you're looking at 600 rounds of attack, 9 ripostes.<br />
<br />
When you are tanking something that has the capability (and reputation) of one-rounding people, ripostes CAN make or break a fight.  Dual wielding while tanking reparme, for instance, you're putting yourself at triple the risk of making it easier for him to one-round you.  Is it significant? Well, that's up to you...I dont like getting one-rounded, we're low on tanks, so i'm going to minimize my ripostes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Okay, to clarify my position at the moment; the only weapon I would use instead of a good dual wield eb combo is my BOW.I've heard that SEWS and VDD can also do the job almost as well.I don't have much experience with those last two myself.I agree that dual wield weapons have an edge on aggro with wa-5 and augs.However, I havent seen a huge differance in aggro between my BOW &amp; BF/BOC(but I usually have aggro) so some posts here prompted me to ask for opinions.<br />
<br />
As far as riposte is concerned on the majority of mob's I do feel the BOW smooths out damage a little.This amount is not enough to give up much aggro for imo hence my origional post.I would not use inferior 2h weapons just for the sake of riposte even on Reparm,Fennin,Blazzax,Odessa etc.However,I've been close enough to dead on those guys in the past with di blown that I think using my BOW instead of my 1h combo was a very good idea.I tank most of these guys every week  for the past while;we only raid 4 quick nights a week now.Until very recently defensive always dropped well before we had these guys dead and several of them hit for over 3k(yeh usually less)so a bad round could be significant.Erm... and those bad rounds happen at the worst time hehe.<br />
<br />
Sooo ,I thought this kinda reflected the majority opinion of this board.I wanted opinions on what I thought was a pretty close call,but, I'm seeing extreme answers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here's the problem.  I'm telling you that it's insignificant.  It's been proven it's insignificant.  You're still worried about getting one rounded.  Fine, maybe that's what's gonna happen, but that's also why you have DI.<br />
<br />
You wanna use 2h?  Go right fucking ahead.  You wanna deny you're doing it for ripostes tho, and think that you actually have some logic behind your reasoning, but the fact is that you still have an irrational fear of being one rounded even tho the chances of something scoring 6 fucking max hits on you from 4 ripostes and it's 2 attacks to kill you are RIDICULOUSLY infinitesimal.<br />
<br />
Once people started figuring out that in the EP HP is not &gt; all, and actually got some AC, the &quot;2h ownz all&quot; argument faded into non existance.  You're either just catching up to that point, or you missed it entirely.</div></div><hr />

The question today is about whether &quot;2h is nearly equivalent&quot; or not.<br />
<br />
There certainly exist some fights where tank survival matters more than anything else (including aggro production).  Due to the streakiness of the RNG, &quot;worst-case&quot; rounds are more likely than they should be statistically.  When the mob finds a lucky blip on the RNG, it is likely to not only riposte but also hit for max, triple/quad, and flurry/proc.  As warriors we can choose to either rely on DI in the worst case, or to lessen the severity of this worst case by using a 2 hander.  DI at 90% success rate is less reliable than simply eliminating one source of ripostes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">06-01-2004, 02:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">DI at 90% success rate is less reliable than simply eliminating one source of ripostes. <br />
<br />
How ya figure?  You can't eliminate 90% of the ripostes by switching to 2h.<br />
<br />
In fact, the spikes you speak of are the reason why DI became commonplace to begin with.  It was just another spell and charisma was just another useless stat until PoP when you could get one rounded with autoattack on or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">06-01-2004, 03:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Warrior's collect a lot of little advantages that add up.I try to maintain di on all bosses.Personally, I think 2hs has a bigger effect on smoothing damage in ep's than a lot of the bits of aa we do.A lot of the mobs can hit me around 3k when defensive wears,I can't see how riposte is not a reasonable consideration.Is this not still considered correct?<br />
<br />
I think di &gt; 2hs vs 1hs  significantly.I expect to have di no matter what I'm wielding when I'm raid tanking.However, I still can and do die for a lot of reasons.Presently, bad rounds on the heavy hitters in ep's are too serious for me to consider dualwielding fast weapons.This may change has some of the mobs  become more trivial, I'm not sure.I have a hard time believing this is out of touch,but, I am open to hearing more opinions.<br />
<br />
Really,what I question more is the breadth of advantage people are finding in aggro with dual eb on lighter hitters.I prefer aggro above all other tanking attributes within reason and don't like to give up much if any.The last time I dualwielded raiding earth I didn't see a clear advantage.Aggro is not easily measured in practice.My aggro is good with my BOW.No one is complaining so maybe this question is a waste of time,but, I can't help it hehe.<br />
<br />
I've always enjoyed reading Haass's opinions often finding them informative and helpful.I'm surprised to hear what sounds like &quot;riposte doesnt matter anymore&quot; &amp; &quot;2h is pretty much useless compared to equal 1h's for tanking&quot; from a couple posters here.Perhaps ,I'm taking it out of context from an existing argument.</div></div><hr />

2h is not dead for warrior's imo,but, I am taking stock again.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
When I tank a mob that hits for 3k, four hits for max will kill me. Three hits for max will not. I can either:<br />
 <br />
- give the mob 14 chances between each CH to get that fourth hit (by using a combo like BF+BOC which are twice as fast as the CH chain)<br />
 <br />
or,<br />
 <br />
- give the mob 6 chances between each CH to get that fourth hit (by using a 2h weapon which has close to the same speed as the CH chain)<br />
 <br />
Or I suppose there is a third option:<br />
 <br />
- be happy with DI's firing rate, and just go through a list of warriors as each one succumbs to the RNG.<br />
 <br />
I suppose it depends on your guild's roster as to whether the last option is reasonable. For my guild, it is not.<br />
 <br />
Naturally, when I'm tanking a mob that only hits for 2.2k or something like that, then ripostes don't particularly concern me. And for a 13k tank, or a tank with a slow 1-hander like DBOTW, obviously they do not share these concerns.</div></div><hr />

I'll tell you a little story.   One day in Ssra I got a little pissed off.   You see, the mobs there had such insane mitigation that all I was getting was 12's and 1's on my damage, just like everyone else.    It was relatively new in Luclin, and we were headed to kill Rhag 2.   I said to myself &quot;Dammit, if I'm getting 1's and 12's, I'm going to use some pile of crap weapon and show that I get the same damage with it that I do with my good weapons&quot;.   <br />
<br />
I wasnt' really expcting to tank, and I asked an enchanter friend who I knew used them to give to his charmed pets for a couple of gnoll hide lariats.   I start using them, and next thin you know, I have to back off because I'm getting aggro.   I'm thinking &quot;wtf?&quot;.    It turned out that my hunch was correct, using GHL's, I did like 13% less damage than using my regular weapons set (At the time was Kriezenn's Flame/Primal), and I chalked that up mostly to the delay difference between the two primary weapons.   <br />
<br />
The thing that wierded me out was how damn much aggro I was getting with the lariats.    I expanded my Lariat tests... and used them to tank Rhag 2, then Arch Lich Rhag Zhadune, then High Priest Ssra, Finally Aten Ha Ra got a taste of my Gnoll Hides.   They weren't my &quot;regular&quot; weapon set, but I used em to see if it could be done, and the answer was... yes, it could PoP comes out and I tanked a few bosses up to Lord Mith Marr with Gnoll Hide Lariats.    After I got my BoWar, I didnt' do much Gnoll Hide testing but the fact remains, I used those damn things on every major mob in Luclin and up to Mith Marr in PoP for wins.   Stun aggro is pretty major.<br />
<br />
Now, back to the regular discussion.   Tests have finally been performed which show aggro based on melee, and this has opened up a whole lot of interesting things.   The first thing it opened was... that aggro based on melee is &quot;Potential damage based on damage bonus + DMG&quot;.  this figure doesn't appear to be affected by defensive or fellstrike.   In other words, the Gnoll Hides fall further back because of only 3 dmg the better geared your raid force is.    WA5 on the other hand will compensate a lot for it.   <br />
<br />
While they're still a great source of aggro particularly for how cheap and easy they are to get, as the damage that your team is putting out continues to increase, more tricks like WA5 and Ykesha Augs are needed to keep the gnoll hide spirit alive.</div></div><hr />

They were piss for damage, but if I wanted aggro, especially if I wanted it on a spellcasting mob, they rocked.   Back in the day when crypt of Dalnir was a popular spot for level 30ish folks, I knew a lot of casters/dps classes that would not group there unless I was in their group.</div></div><hr />

( a had a few mage friends whom i would save them whips for when i was hunting inside paw.. they'd give me a plat for each one and i thought it was funny. damn things dropped like rain in the karanas )</div></div><hr />

I remember vividly giving one of mine to a friend and then running past paw on the way to rathe mts. and asking a group if I could loot one that was rotting on the ground, which of course they let me do.  :)</div></div><hr />
