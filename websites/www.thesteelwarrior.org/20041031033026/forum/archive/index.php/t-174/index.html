<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>overlordbarreck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey All, I just got flagged for HoH yesterday and was wondering if it would be possible for a 65 shaman and warrior to duo in HoH, and if so, where would be the best places to hunt.  Any input is greatly appreciated</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grendonbb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No its not going to be possible.  Well, technically I suppose it could be, but it would be a lot more work than it's worth, and would be faster for the shaman to just solo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have yet to find a spot in PoP that I can duo and get anything close to the exp of the average half-decent PoV group.  Pretty tough to do anything without a CHer and a slower and if you don't have some DPS your exp rate is gonna be pretty crappy.<br />
<br />
Don't underestimate druids btw.  I have had some great groups in BoT with druids.  They can keep up with tier 2 mobs with their heals, snare, DS, and even throw in a nuke once in a while.  If I have a shaman in my group I'll take a 65 druid with his spells over a cleric (assuming someone in the group has access to a rez bot hehe).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>chongo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Me and My Druid aggro kite the zone in mobs.<br />
<br />
Yes, the black armored thingies.<br />
<br />
I just have her snare/dot/nuke and keep agro, while I whip out the 2hs and just pound on the mob while she's kiting it.<br />
<br />
Works pretty well, 3-4% aa for the each of us. and takes roughly 5min a mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>aakla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">HoH was only good at the begining of PoP when mobs droped Windblade that belt and sword and whatever else, and the parchemnts. after they removed those and made them extremly rare, hoh is a waste of time IMO. its one of those places you go if you can solo and everything else if taken.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Actually, a shaman and I have duo'd in HoH for pretty good exp.  I prefer this zone to PoV, primarily because it's a lot quieter, and there are less annoying people to deal with.  I don't know why you posted this twice though, I've given my input already on the other thread you started about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>overlordbarreck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">for some reason I couldn't see any of my posts after I posted them, so thought somethin went wrong and reposted .. I can seem em now though .. kinda wierd, thanks for the input though =)</div></div><hr />
