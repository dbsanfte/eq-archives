<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vaylon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know I asked before if anyone knew the haste on the augs and it was said the one from MM for 1150 pts is 36% haste.  My new question is I heard the augs can stack and I'm sure the max haste is still 41% so I'm thinking the 100 pt one from Rajukan (I think it was there) would be enough to give me 41% haste.  Using a Windraiders belt right now and plan on either doing the haste aug (LDoN way) or going to kill Xanamech for his neck piece so I can get a Belt of Dwarf Slaying (for the hps).  Anyone know for sure if you can get to the 41% haste through Augs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Crystara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Works like any other worn haste item, one with the highest haste takes precedence, the others don't stack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Demorgoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">1: Worn haste items don't stack. Never have, never will. One worn haste + one spell haste = cap, plus v.3 haste from bardsong or quarm earring independant of cap.<br />
<br />
2: 45% is the highest known single item haste, available on a couple of PoTime items (Inny shoulders and Quarm belt). There's no hardcoded/mechanical reason for not having a 100% haste item and doing away with the need for chanter/shaman haste</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vaylon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Oh I know the haste Items don't stack but I heard that the Augments do...up to 41%.  I was just trying to see if anyone has verified that it true or are you just stuck with 36% haste with the aug from MM adventures.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Demorgoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Tak: 100 points<br />
Type 3: Jagged Slate of Battle Prowess, Effect:Haste (21%) HEAD/BACK/WAIST <br />
<br />
VT+ level haste split across 2 items for an extra 3 hours of adventuring? I think you were misinformed about haste augs stacking.<br />
<br />
Mistmore: 1150 points<br />
Type 3: Gravestone Fragment of Flailing Dead, Worn Effect: Haste (36%) HEAD/BACK/RANGE/WAIST <br />
<br />
If they stacked, who would ever buy this one when you could have superior haste plus another upgraded item for the same price?<br />
<br />
Where did you hear the augs stacked, and what reason was given for the arbitrary 41% value when existing haste items are already above thet? I think you were lied to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vaylon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">That's what I thought Demorgoth just wanted to verify it.  Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Blacktalun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">interesting thought though, since if you had 2 augs on the same item technically it would be only one item.  I still don't see that they would ever allow it to work this way though. Personally I will simply be hunting for a 41% haste items either from PoP or NToV. (don't think I will ever be seing Time)</div></div><hr />
