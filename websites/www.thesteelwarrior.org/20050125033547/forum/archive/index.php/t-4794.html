My question is, should I keep my BoC equipped? Bag it? Or sell like I know many other of the panic stricken warriors on my server will. Now I know the 61+ disc's are gonna be hard to find and all, but I unfortunately wasn't lucky enough to win my BoC off of the AoW. Now I wish to save something of my investment, if it needs saving. The weapons I have to replace it are vastly superior if that's a question on wether to trade em in or out. Vastly superior in dps and stats that is. BoC still remains as my only EB weapon. Thanks for the help in advance.</div></div><hr />

Anger III + SotB = Un'augd BoC...(actually better /shrug)<br />
<br />
CHoS + Ykesha + SotB + Anger III + Provoke + Taunt + Agressive + Fellstrike = more than enough for any mob any time...<br />
<br />
If someone is out aggroing you with that, then god damn please let them die.<br />

<br />
All existing disciplines can be purchased as tomes in either East Commons or the Plane of Knowledge. To learn a discipline, the Tome must be turned into your guildmaster.<br />
<br />
If sounds like the new disciplines are actually pretty easy to get.</div></div><hr />

I hope it's on the vendors like the others, but it's still questionable about how you'll go about getting the brand new disciplines.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the BoC has a very good ratio even before the proc is considered, so i highly doubt the value is going to hit the floor.  It may lose some vaule, but who cares.  I look at it like all the insane people who collect star wars toys in the original package;  The stuff is to use, not to collect value and sell.  By all means if you think you don;t need it sell it, otherwise it still a great weapon.</div></div><hr />

I have a BOC with anger III. Was lots of fun today not worry about aggro. Provoke is very nice. I would keep the BOC though, chanter still pulled aggro off me early a couple of times</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just kidding =-p <br />
In all honesty I think the BoC will still maintain a good deal of it's value because it's STILL an AOW drop, and it's STILL a great weapon without even considering EB. BUT I don't think people are going to continue paying 300k for nice ratio, nice stats, and an aggro proc that isn't going to be the weapons shining virtue anymore...</div></div><hr />

BoC with Anger III = better<br />
<br />
You can never have too much aggro, and 15/20 with 100 hps is on par with any other droppable weapon you're gonna find to replace it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zynth</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 07:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the stats and ratio are amazing. it;s a great weapon w/o the proc. in addition to it being highly offensive with the 15str/dex, a great DPS ratio, and of course the proc, it's also a defensive tool with 15sta and 100 raw hp. not having a recommended or required lvl, i cant understand why anyone would willing sell one before they have somethign better in their offhand....or an uber 2h weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Prytty</div><div class="date">12-19-2003, 08:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The BoC will retain most of its value if for nothing else than the fact that it's simply the best 1h twinking weapon around.</div></div><hr />
