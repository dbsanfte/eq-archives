<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Apoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all... Thanks in advance for any help given.<br />
<br />
  My warrior is currently using a Frostbringer mainhand and an LSoEE offhand. I was wondering if you could give me some suggestions on what to upgrade to. I'm looking for something that may or may not get me to 60+. I have around 30-50k to spend at most.<br />

  I've heard about getting a GSoT for aggro, but I always thought that Two-handed weapons were bad for getting aggro. Don't see what a 1 second stun would do for aggro either. An explanation of why that weapon is so hyped would be great. Keep in mind I also want decent DPS. I was thinking of doing one of the following combos:<br />
<br />
Shortblade of lightning (mainhand)/Frosty (offhand)<br />
<br />
Fleshgrinder (mainhand)/Frosty (offhand)<br />
<br />
Snowchipper (main)/Frosty (off)<br />
<br />
Greatstaff of thunder (main)<br />
<br />
War marshal's bladed staff (main)<br />
<br />
Windblade (main)<br />
<br />
Bloodpoint (main)/Bloodpoint (off)... Haven't really heard much about these for aggro, figured I might as well toss it up.<br />
<br />
Bloodpoint (main)/Frosty (off)<br />
<br />
Fleshgrinder (main)/Fleshgrinder (off) (this would require some saving up...hehe)<br />
<br />
Anklesmasher (main)/Frosty (off)<br />
<br />
-----------<br />
<br />
  That's about it for what I'm considering. I'm sure some of you experts out there can help me narrow it down. Feel free to add any weapons I didn't mention to this combo list. Also, an explantation of your advice would be awesome. Again, thanks a ton in advance for any help given.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">GSoT, or the SBoL/Frosty combo<br />
<br />
GSoT = stun. Stun = uber aggro. That's why you hear alot of warriors say that pallies are preferred tanks since they can aggro with stuns more effectively.<br />
<br />
<br />
SBoL/Frosty because Frosty is AC debuff, and that's good taunt. And SBoL is just damn nice as far as I'm concerned.<br />
<br />
EDIT: For the love of god get some strength items. I know that people sometimes say go all hp/sta. But when it comes down to it, 86 srength won't be enough, sorry.<br />
<br />
Lifetaps are bad aggro. Thus the BP/BP combo sucks.<br />
<br />
That goes for the FG/FG combo, too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Caeden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">First off Thaak, Fleshgrinder procs 150DD, FG/FG is not sucky aggro, plus it's 12/19 +proc, so the DPS is decent.<br />
<br />
Second, I was gonna suggest Wavecrasher, is only 9/19 so the DPS isn't that great, but the proc is a 25% slow (good aggro), Wavecrasher should easily be within your price range, if not less, <br />
<br />
Wavecrasher is also Primary only, which may turn you off to it, but I had a Wavecrasher/Fleshgrinder combo going at 58 (pre PoP), and it was great, I never had a problem holding aggro.<br />
<br />
Wavecrasher/Frostbringer is also a very good combo for aggro, but again the DPS isn't anything special.<br />
<br />
Wavecrasher also helps when there is no Shaman/Chanter around, of course it's nothing like Turgur's Insects, but still a 25% slow.<br />
<br />
Yeah, and by now, you're all probably thinking &quot;Wow, he's obsessed with the Wavecrasher&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I thought FG was only a 75dd?<br />
<br />
*shrug*<br />
<br />
EDIT: Just saw he's only lvl 43.<br />
<br />
And based on the fact he can't use the GSoT, I say FG + SBoL for the reasons already said.<br />
<br />
But maybe put SBoL in prim for the proc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Caeden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">FG gives +75hp, but proc is 150 dd, is also reqired level of 51, cuz its from CT.  Also, by SBoL you mean Shortblade of Lightning, correct? If so, last I knew Shortblade did not have a proc, just a very nice ratio, 13/19.  Thouch you could mean something else, but Shortblade of Lightning is only SBoL I can think of right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dalbe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'd  mainhand the FG or SBoL for dps. Offhand the FB for the aggro proc</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Caeden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Right now he's at 43, can't use FG until 51, and SBoL is recomended level of 56, so it won't be maxed out yet.<br />
<br />
Personally, I'd go Wavecrasher/Frostbringer for Aggro now, at 51, I'd sell one and get a FG and do what you'd like from there Wavecrasher/Fleshgrinder (higher aggro, lower DPS), or Fleshgrinder/Frostbringer, Frostbringer/Fleshgrinder (lower aggro, higher DPS) would get fine until 60 for sure, then it would depend on you're guild, and how much MT/MA you play would decide the rest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Apoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Didn't expect all these replies. Thanks a lot.<br />
<br />
I heard from several warriors on my server that wavecrashers get resisted 90% of the time and end up just being a glorified lammy.<br />
<br />
When giving me advice on weapons, assume I'm whatever the rec/req level is.<br />
<br />
Why is the proc on a bloodpoint bad aggro? I'd imagine a tap would piss a mob off a lot.../shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Caeden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Even if proc gets resisted, it's still causing aggro, well slow type procs anyways.  There is a thread in the Bunker talking about slow procs, but I am too lazy to attach it right now.<br />
<br />
The only reason I suggested the Wavecrasher is because you aren't 51+ yet, and the Wavecrasher will do more for you now than the combo you have going, and you don't have to worry about any rec/req level for it to proc, seeing as it procs at level 1.<br />
<br />
But in all honesty the best way to find a combo that works for you, that you are completely satisfied with, is to test them for yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Lorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Dunno how much cash you have left.<br />
<br />
Your setup is very close to mine.  I would get . . .<br />
<br />
1) Another Fierce Heraldic Bracer<br />
2) Mosq Leg earring or Bloodmetal Earring<br />
3) 2 x Valorium Gallantry rings<br />
4) Clattering Bone Necklace<br />
5) Barnicle Covered Axe<br />
<br />
When you get high enough and good faction, go for Champ Crown and Myrm Gloves and Champ or Myrm BP MQ.  Also go two hander for dps and duel wield for aggro.  Or get a GSoT when u get lvl 55 for both aggro and dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Thaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">At 43, you don't need to worry about taunt, it's more about DPS until about 50-52.<br />
<br />
And yes, SBoL = Shortblade of Lightning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">IMO, Go with a GSoT, a soon as you have the level to use one. Until then, just go with what you have now.<br />
<br />
Nice aggro, decent damage, on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Thaak's latest post is right. At 43, your aggro weps really doesn't matter - well, it does, but not alot.<br />
<br />
What you need is a weapon without a Recommended or Required level. Blackened Acrylia Blade (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=51260) is nice DPS and does have any Rec. or Req. levels. Put that offhand with a Frostbringer mainhand and you will be fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Apoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">As I said in my last post in this thread, my level shouldn't be taken in consideration. Assume I'm 55+, because that's when I'll be equipping the weapons I choose to buy. Until then they'll be banked, but I want to buy them now.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway, just some quick updates... I believe I found a great weapon.<br />
<br />
You say the GSoT is amazing for taunt because of the stun, right? I found a 9/20 warhammer that procs stun. I think the name is something like &quot;Sarnak warclub&quot; or &quot;sarnak warhammer&quot; or something similar. Would this be good for taunt?<br />
<br />
Also, I may just save up and get a (Copper xxxxx xxxx hammer). It comes out of Droga, and is 13/20 with proc: Force shock (which I believe is a 170DD). I'm told it drops off a simple NPC with a placeholder that spawns every 10 minutes, and some people got 2 in one hour... It's 70k right now, but sinking (allegedly)<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks again. I read over every post here several times and really appreciate the insight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Smakz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">yes, the Sarnak hammerthingy is a good aggro weapon.  One of the better to come out of Kunark in fact.  Its one of those &quot;diamond in the rough&quot; type of weapons that alot of people forget about.  <br />
<br />
Though it does lack in DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Apoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Good to hear. Can I get more thoughts on it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Duke73</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Anklesmasher owns Wavecrasher as far as aggro (owned both) not to mention snare sure does come in handy.<br />
A new yak makes a good offhand, little better aggro than a Frostbringer from my experiance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>rathsar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">IMHO any of the 3 new weapons listed under the - new aggro weapons thread will serve you better than the GSoT.<br />
<br />
I have used GSoT a lot but now I have my new combo of Sarnak Spine Dagger/ new 1hb 13 22 plus 3 cold dmg (Grand something - forget exact name), my taunt rocks.<br />
<br />
The dagger being 13 22 swings and procs that much more than GSoT ever did, and when the mobs are saving against posion at -30 as apposed to against magic, it lands much more.<br />
<br />
I got mine for 10K but once word gets around I suspect the pc will rocket - buy one while you can.<br />
<br />
That plus the copper hammer of striking and you will be set until 60+<br />
<br />

Good luck with it.</div></div><hr />
