<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Forak</div><div class="date">09-09-2004, 09:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I need some help fellow warriors.  I am a 51 Froglok Warrior and am having problems holding aggro.  I have magelo so you can take a look at what I have and let me know what I am doing wrong.  I have been switching weapons a lot lately so that I can up my weapon skills.  All are over or close to 150.  1hs is my main and is at 205.  I use the Blizzard-Born Blade and the Venomous Axe mostly for the proc but it doesnt seem to help.  I have about 3000pp in the bank so I can make some small purchases.  LDoN is an option but have very few points right now.  Groups have been hard to come by for some reason.  Might be the hours I really get to play.  Please let me know if you have any ideas.  Thanks in advance.<br />
<br />
Wasn't sure if this was the right area to post this but I am sure it will involve different weapons so I started here anyway.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Balfamor</div><div class="date">09-09-2004, 10:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Get a Copper Hammer of Striking for your mainhand and Sword of the Bloodsword for your offhand.  Not quite sure what they go for, but you can probably afford them if you sell a few things.  Also make sure you are using your hate disciplines.  At 51 you still only have Provoke, but in another level you'll have Bellow which will ne a nice upgrade over Provoke.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">09-09-2004, 10:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">sword of the bloodsworn might be cheaper for ya froggy. but i'd ditch that blizzard blade thingamajig; take your 3K, sell off any odds and ends ( and strip down alts a bit as well for this ) ... and go get either of the Droga Weapons. They'll last to 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">09-09-2004, 11:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah, hmmm. Okay, as has been pointed out, level to 52 and you'll get an improvement to you incite line (Bellow, which has an initial hate of twice what your current incite-line disc -- provoke -- has).<br />
I'm going to say that you won't see a dramatic improvement in your aggro until you get either the copper hammer of striking or the sword of the bloodsworn. Buy whichever is cheapest first. On my server, that would be the bloodsworn, but check prices for a few days. Again, server prices vary, but there was a bloodsworn up on my server the other day for 7K, so 7-9K is probably what you are looking at needing. If you can't get both of these by the time the Great Staff of Thunder will proc for you, get that and use it until you have both droga weapons. Get it anyway as it costs only 200 plat or so and you'll have a 2-hander (can't equip until lvl 55, if I recall correctly).<br />
While you are in the bazaar, buy some Halas 10-pound meat pies and (if there is any for sale) grobb liquised meat. (Make sureyou know how to use stat food; there a thread here somewhere on it if you don't.)<br />
Second I would say that probably the best aggro set up you have now would be the cutlass in mainhand and the bloodguard in offhand. Eventually (once you get closer to rec level) the defenders will be better offhand than the bloodguard, but right now it isn't. it would be advisable for you to get one of the droga weapons before that happens, though.<br />
Because it's critical for you to hold aggro, I'd pay absolutely no attention at all to keeping your weapon skills up at this point. Use the best weapon set up for aggro that you can. Sell everything else, as Holywrath says. <br />
<br />
You didn't ask, but you're also going to need better armor soon. What you do for that depends on your capacity for farming/running a bazaar trader, whether or not you have a group of friends you regularly hunt with, and so forth. If you don't have a regular group, you can probably get a group in PoJ for the bump you need to level 52; you can also get LDoN groups. You're better off in the long run saving Everfrost LDoN points for anger augs before you spend anything on armor, but you're getting close to having such low ac that you will frighten clerics (the cowards!). But fi you do some BB LDoNs, and you are really desperate, I think a lot of the 150-point armor would be an upgrade for you, and I don't think I'd spend any money on armor until I got my weapons squared away.<br />
If you have a good group of friends and you get to lvl 52, you can hope for dropped augments in LDoN; you might be able to convince some of them to go to Kael, where, if the random number generator favors you, you might get a corroded drop. Champions would be the easiest quest armor, I think.<br />
Around in there you could also try Veksar. Research kylong shinguards and the soulscream belt (your haste is fine, but the belt is sellable). With a good group in the mid 50s, you could get to both mobs, I think.<br />
<br />
You have a lot of work to do: welcome to life in the low 50s as an untwinked warrior. Don't get discouraged.<br />
Good luck</div></div><hr />

Just like the GSoT.<br />
<br />
But also, like Brabble said, I'd start working on equipment upgrades, although not to the detriment of getting agro weapons.  The 150pt armor in BB LDoN camp would be good armor to work on to build a baseline for upgrades.  It's called Death Embracer armor, if you want to look it up in Lucy (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/itemlist.html?searchtext=death+embracer)...oh wait, there it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Saeborne</div><div class="date">09-09-2004, 11:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">They'll last to 65.<br />
<br />
Hell, I'm 65 and I'm STILL using those drorga weapons.  I was in a very similar position, where I simply couldn't hold aggro... posted my Question on this board, and got the same answer... CHoS and SotBS.  Picked them up the next day, and haven't looked back.  <br />
<br />
Now I can piss off mobs like a champ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">09-09-2004, 11:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">as a reference; i used my SotB right up until I got my Blade of War ( BoC\SotB ).<br />
<br />
Yeah, it's sad that the Droga Pair is the end-all casual players answer to aggro but when an answer like that is so clear it's almost blasphemy not to pass it along :D<br />
<br />
I wonder what the next cookie cutter weapons will be come next expansion? :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">09-09-2004, 12:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Everyone here suggesting the droga pair needs to be pistol-whipped a few times.  They are fine weapons but plz look at the person in question's magelo.  He doesnt seem to be loaded with cash or have anything he can even use to trade.<br />
<br />
In your case Buy a Greatstaff of thunder for a hundred or so PP.  You'll need to be 55 to use it, but 4 levels isnt all that hard to get these days (can get it in under a week i'd imagine).<br />
<br />
You'll get just as much mileage and 100x more bang for your buck out of a 100pp item.  Spend the thousands of pp you'll save on armor upgrades.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">09-09-2004, 02:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I actually considered suggesting that, Apolyon. I ended up suggesting he level to 52, get one droga quick and the GsoT when he could use it.<br />
I can't see a better way of solving his aggro problems for the next four levels; if he's willing to continue with his aggro problems until he can use the GSoT, then that certainly would allow him to bump his armor faster, which is always a good thing. On the other hand,  going from level 51 to level 55 with bad aggro would sux. Level 51 to 55 with good aggro goes fast, but I bet it's a lot slower with bad aggro. Every time you got a group you'd have to find a new shaman and cleric who have never met you and therefore might group with you. heh, that's an exaggeration, but it really is no fun to play a warrior who can't get mobs to hit him. If he has a guild with members willing to form basically a pl group and let him tag along as gimp dps to PoD or something, he might be able to level without actually having to tank or be a functional group member, but bleh.<br />
It's possible he could go to Grieg's End and get a blade of Insanity, which would be a better main hand than anything else he has. But you'd have to know some people who wanted to go there, and if they were all lvl 51 they might have some hard going. And I don't know how rare the blade is. Anyway, it's a marginal upgrade. Infact, all the weapons I can think of him getting himself are so marginal that killing EK spiders and lions are a faster &amp; easier path to better weapons that he can use now and will keep for a while.<br />
So, I figure, the droga won't hurt.<br />
It will cost him about three pieces of, say, barbed ringmail armor or perhaps one piece of cultural (my server's prices for cutlural are in the 6K+ range). he's MM as far as deity goes &amp; I don't know about his cultural options, but between buying one droga weapon and one piece of cultural armor, I think his best bet would be the droga at this point.<br />
I'd be willing to bet though that at level 55 the circumstances will be such that he'll start using the GSoT for quite a while, and for exactly the reason Apolyon refers to: he'll only have one droga weapon and not enough to buy another. a droga weapon + bloodguard is not going to be equal to the GSoT, obviously, so for 200 pp he can have another aggro boost--a very good case for doing that rather than getting a second droga, at least right away. His ac will be lagging and he'll be trying to save LDoN points for an anger aug. So, the GSoT looks darn good at lvl 55 and would afford him some much needed breathing room for putting his resources into armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Forak</div><div class="date">09-09-2004, 05:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really appreciate the responses.  I am going to check into all the stuff you mentioned.  Anybody know if there is a good site that would give me some armor ideas?  I am wanting to know more about my diety options because MM is required of a Froglok.  I do not know much about the effects of diety choice and all.  I have a small group that I play with fairly regular so if there is anything I can get that way, let me know also.  This group consists of a 55 Druid, a 53 Bard, and a 56 Druid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ssuruss</div><div class="date">09-10-2004, 11:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">First, sell your bag of misc weapons. Second do some LDoNs and save up for augs that will increase agro and/or armor and that will improve you dramatically. I'd try some SRo for a yak aug, EF for an anger2/3 aug. Also EF has solid plate armor at a cost of 760AP(I think that's right) and NRo has better armor but at a cost of 1492AP. <br />
<br />
For specific weapons, thinking cheap, look for SSoYs, yes old yak's are still decent agro. If you can get a pair of them they will hold you over until you can afford the coper hammer and sword of the bloodsworn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">09-10-2004, 11:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For general info on zones, gear, or just about anything else:<br />

Since apparently you Frogs don't have cultural armor (uh, yet) you might also try checking out the Magelo links of any agnostic warriors (do a search for &quot;agnostic&quot;) here on The Steelwarrior. Check always to make sure you can actually wear the armor you're looking at, but it should give you some ideas.<br />
<br />
And do weigh what Apolyon says about the Great Staff of Thunder carefully. If you get to 55 and still can't afford the droga stuff (entirely possible) then the GSoT will allow you to do your job, and it really does just cost 100-200 plat on most servers. It can and will afford you some room to upgrade armor and save up for the droga set. (Apolyon has in the past argued that the GSoT has such good aggro that the Droga weapons are not strictly necessary. In this, I think he has a minority view, but he did use the GSoT himself to very good effect, and even warriors who hold the view that the droga set is better also agree that on a hate-generated-per-plat-basis, the GSoT is the top bang-for-the-buck weapon in the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Forak</div><div class="date">09-10-2004, 01:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dont know if I got a good deal or not but it seemed like it at the time.  I received a new BP for 3000pp last night.  It is an Architech's Bejeweld BP (spelling/name).  I also was invited to my first group in PoI last night and exp was rocking.  I have a friend that is going to take me to the GoD zones and see about more equipment.  <br />
<br />
I looked at the weapons you talked about and can get the SotB for about 3.6k and the CHoS for a little over 6k.  Just like you said, the GSoT runs about 3 or 400pp on my server.  I may have a chance at a free one though with the help of some friends.  I am sure everybody knows how fun it is to come by platinum so only time with tell which comes first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daggorr</div><div class="date">09-10-2004, 03:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Forak the Breastplate is a great start and a good deal at 3k.<br />
<br />
While the suggestions state here are all good ones they can all cost you  total of 0pp if you've got the drive and ability to get a group going.<br />
<br />
Droga <br />
- Sword of the bloodsworn drops of the Seer i the king room<br />
- Copper hammer of striking drops off the king himself.<br />
<br />
Veskar<br />
- Soulscream belt Drops off the rotting shopkeeper<br />
- Kylong shinguards drop of the feral lord<br />
- Dented kunzar war helm drops of the heirophant across from the shops<br />
<br />
Plane of Mischief<br />
- Grand pauldrons of study drop fmr the fraudulent chest in one fo the first rooms<br />
<br />
Velktors<br />
- forgotten ebony earring drops off the fierce spider on the first floor(rare)<br />
- Velium etched helm drops of the same spider is is common as water<br />
- Save up Crushed gems there for thurg quest armor and hit the arena in Kael when you get some levels<br />
<br />
ALL of the above are campable by a strong, well run group.  This will save you roughly 55k in upgrades at a minimum.  And on top of the drops you'll get good experiance in all the areas listed.  <br />
<br />
Granted all this is dependant on a strong group but only gets easier as you gain levels.  Find yourself some regular hunting partners and when you start clicking a as group, start hitting camps and the gear will flow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Forak</div><div class="date">09-10-2004, 06:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Do any of the above areas you listed require a key or flag of some sort to get in to?  I do not know much about the flags and planar progression yet because I have not had the chance to get a lot of groups there yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">09-10-2004, 06:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">None of those zones is in Planes of Power. None of them are keyed either, so you can just walk on in. I'd suggest ignoring your armor in favor of your weapons right now though. If you can't hold aggro, it doesn't matter how many hp you have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daggorr</div><div class="date">09-10-2004, 06:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only zone that has any kind of zone in restriction is Plane of mischief, but al you need to be is lvl 46 to get in, its an old world zone and to give fair warning the zone out is hidden at the base of a tree and drops you in the ocean in cobalt scar.  So bring a porter with you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Forak</div><div class="date">09-10-2004, 06:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Glad you told me that.  Only plane I really been to so far is PoI.  Exp was nice for the group I was with too.  I have been trying to get around more.  Tired of the same old zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">09-13-2004, 08:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Daggnor's suggestions for places to hunt are good ones.<br />
The Veksar mobs will be far easier for you to tank at lvl 51 than would be King Dronan for the CHoS, though, so I'd be inclined to hunt Veksar first. In Veksar, mind your crowd control. It's a fun zone, I think.<br />
that was a good deal on the breastplate too--would be on my server, anyway.</div></div><hr />
