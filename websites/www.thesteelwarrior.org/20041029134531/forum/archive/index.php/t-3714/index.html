<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>warmidget</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">yes, another one of those 'check my magelo' threads.  Created a new acct for this character to start fresh.  Just dinged 65 and am AA'ing heavily (plan on about 15-20aa's a week).  I have the a 4 box balanced setup if needed to farm things.. and can get 2 full groups to work mobs in a moments notice (we did lcea with 9 pc's).<br />
<br />
With the augment changes i am not sure if i want to invest the time in getting the royals armor and aug them concidering how long it would take per peice (concidering 1 armor+3 augments needed to buy per slot).  That is time well spent elsewhere (AAing for exp).  Though i will not mind LDoN if that is what is best to do.<br />
<br />
Don't have tons of money, buy main is a GM Halfling Tailor, so can always make money selling haversacks.  So thats not much of an issue (no buting 3 200k items at a time for me)<br />
<br />
also seriously needing to get some better agro weapons.  But i am lost in this catagory, there are soo many of them, please help? =)<br />
<br />
Sorry to keep it long, just trying to get/do the best i can for my guild and friends =)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Auron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">As far as LDoN you really cant beat it, since you kill 2 birds with 1 stone getting AA Exp and adventure points.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even without any augments it's a pretty solid set of armor, better than Fierce Heraldic, can worry about augmenting later. Still 28 wins on normal setting per piece of course.<br />
Since you have a 4 box set-up you should have lil trouble getting the two agro weapons out of Droga, copper hammer of striking and sword of the bloodsworn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaqyl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Not much plat with a 4box setup?  Either your ecomony blows donkey nuts or you're clueless when it comes to playing the ecomony.  With just a war/cle duo I've easily cycled over 2million plat in the last year.  One of my friends made a ranger which I twinked with over 750k in gear including an ST key.<br />
<br />
Just take some time and learn your market.  I've made plat by farming everything from droga, to duoing the Overking for IncarnadineBP's and cleric epic MQ's, to duoing PoG back when BD's were going for 2k+ a pop.  There are always ways to make plat if you really need it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Uukla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Unless you want to spend time farming plat, do LDoN with guildies, and get points while getting aa.<br />
<br />
If you do LDoN hardcore (high DPS, Port class to get you out fast after) you can do about 1 adventure every 60 min or so.  As long as you dont screw around in between, the AA rate shouldnt be too bad.<br />
<br />
Farm a copper hammer of striking in droga, or if your guild has no one who knows the zone, buy it for 2 haversacks, and then move on to doing your AA work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>warmidget</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Will admit i am no pro at working the bazaar market.  Only reciently have been able to box several accts, and most of that time so far has been focused on leveling. Am working on it though...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Togr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Also depends on what your guild will be doing once you become MT.  If y'all will be doing xana then there is one solution for your haste or agro.  Assuming y'all can do Kael then a Vindi/Statue BP would be a good option as well.<br />
<br />
Do the Strength of the Elements quest for a 100hp shoulder item, with your 4 chars you can do everything except Yael, for that get 2-4 more people.<br />
<br />
Finish your executioner trial to get PoV/PoS flagged for +10hps to your charm.<br />
<br />
Dunno what your economy is, but you could consider selling Windblade/Fleshgrinder and buy a SoD.  Also might be able to sell nightmare and buy twisted longbow for a profit (dunno prices anymore, but twisted seem to drop often)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>warmidget</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">VIndi is easy for us.. i had my first experience at MT yesterday doing King Thormax and went smoothly (only death was over agroed caster).  Started on Xana yesterday but wiped learning strat, though won't happen again on it.  We are trying to do NToV weekly (as raid time/spawned uncamped dragons permits) and are getting it down pretty good.<br />
<br />
have a few guidies needing to visit phinny, so that quest should not take long.<br />
<br />
working on getting guildies/allies who missed poj/pos flagging done currently.<br />
<br />
SoD.. thats the sceptre right? thought that thing was like 350k or such? if thats the case BoC is 150k less.  Correct me if i am wrong?<br />
<br />
(i appreciate all the advice so far and am working on it as i go)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Togr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Wow, thats an interesting economy if a BoC is cheap and an SoD expensive, of course maybe y'all woke sleeper really early, but on Fennin its 160K to a SoD and 280K for a BoC (last i noticed)<br />
<br />
Sceptre of Destruction<br />
MAGIC ITEM  <br />
Slot: PRIMARY  SECONDARY  <br />
Skill: 1H Blunt  Atk Delay: 18<br />
DMG: 12  <br />
STR: +10  DEX: +10  STA: +10  HP: +50  <br />
MANA: +50  <br />
Effect: Anarchy (Combat)<br />
WT:  0.2    Size: SMALL<br />
Class: WAR CLR PAL RNG SHD DRU MNK BRD ROG SHM BST <br />
Race: ALL<br />
<br />
I'd say soon as you get Xana down farm 'em a lot to get your melee haste items and tank agro weaps.  Soon as you get your haste neck you can make a large hp gain with a Mask of the Sky from Eashen.  As you keep doing Vindi/TMax/Statue also kill Zland/Kland/Sont/Lini for ST keys opening up some good upgrade options (100hp bow would be great for you atm)<br />
<br />
Another thing y'all can work on is the mini's in PoStorms gathering medallions and parts to complete your BoT quests for another charm increase.</div></div><hr />
