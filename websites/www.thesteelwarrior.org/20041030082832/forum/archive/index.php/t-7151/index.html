<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Narcy Mirrorgazer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello!  Lurking for a couple of days.  Great information!<br />
<br />
My halfling warrior, Narcy, is level 25 and I am feeling the need to upgrade.  I mostly group and obtaining buffs isn't difficult for me (heck I'm cute).  In particular, I could use some help with weapons.  Right now I am using a Sarnak Battle Shield and Blackened Acrylia Blade.  Please check out my magelo and let me know your thoughts.  <br />
<br />
Also, I see a lot of acronyms for weapons - is there a FAQ or a key to those? edit - found it!<br />
<br />
Thanks  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kogur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">First and foremost,<br />
<br />
You are able to dual wield and at your level that will be your best bet for dps and aggro. Ditch that shield, you ain't a pally. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">ditch the shield for a decent 1hander =) ... may want to look into a fbss or SCHW for haste.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dinged 21-25 last night in an awesome group in Mistmoore.  I was actually in the bazaar this AM looking for a good 1hs replacement for the shield.  I didn't have any luck.  Most of what I'd want had minimum required level of 51.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions for non-crap mid level weapon combos?  I have a sorta decent amount to put into them depending on their longevity.<br />
<br />
If you had 10K what choices would you make to get me into my 40s?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kogur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">On rare occasions, or if you can talk the person into it... you could get a Swiftblade of Zek for around 10kpp. 11damage 18 delay 100HP will definately carry you for a long time. No level restriction either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Caldron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">For armor you may want to look at Dwarf Cultural non diety armor. I wore mine till late 50's it is bright red in color it rocks. Stats are good too. I just got parts for a smith and he made it for me and I just donated a couple K pp for his time. <br />
<br />
Here is the Chest the rest is good too:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">nab a wurmslayer for cheap ... a lamentation is a cheap alternateive weapon as well.<br />
<br />
centi shortsword and longsword are good lowbie weps.  a jade mace would do well too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Halfling  smooches for you!<br />
<br />
I like the idea of Brellium.  My main is a tradeskill junky and has some of the sub components already.  I will look for a Dwarven Smith tonight!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kharse</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">From 25-45 I used the Blackened Acrylia Blade (which oddly enough seems better then the old epic weapon) and a 10/19  or sometimes a 13/24. Never could figure out which wa better for offhand . Both cost me less than 1k on Bertox.<br />
Never lost aggro with either combo for those levels.<br />
<br />
<br />
Course kharse got deleted round 45 so Im not sure how long you can use them for but..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Abividad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'd say if you're not having trouble keeping your weapon skills maxed for level to go for the Wrumslayer also. You'd want to use that till about level 40 or so. By then your damage bonus will be starting to add up a bit, and a fast delay weapon like a Lammy or Defiance will outdamage the Wurmslayer. On a level 35 alt that I play just for fun and not min maxing, I have a Venemous Ax of the Velium Brood mainhand (85 DD Poison proc starting at level 35) and a Wakizashi of the Frozen Skies (81 DD Cold proc starting at level 20) in offhand. I mainhanded the Wakizashi until I hit 35. I'll retire it at 37 when the proc on Short Sword of Yekesha starts to fire (75 DD + stun).<br />
<br />
If you have not done so already. Go to PoK library or EC tunnel and pick up the Bellow Tome for level 20. Helps some with generating agro. <br />
<br />
Also just looked at your magelo skills. Get a 1hb and practice as much as you can. You'll want to pick up a Copper Hammer of Striking once you're at the elvel for it, and will be a bummer to have a 1hb skill of 1. Iksar berserker club is fast 7/18 with a proc that increases your str and dex if I remember right.<br />
<br />
Good luck and have fun :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Narcy Mirrorgazer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">... Wurmslayer ... Lammy ... Defiance ... Venemous Ax of the Velium Brood ... Wakizashi of the Frozen Skies ... Short Sword of Ykesha ... Iksar berserker club<br />
<br />
Woot!  Thanks, I'll be adding these to my bazaar search list.  I did pick up a tome of Provoke at 20 - I'll have to wait til 52 I think for Bellow.<br />
<br />
Havin a blast =)<br />
<br />
Based on all your advice I did a little shopping and updated my magelo.<br />
<br />
1HS : Centi LS, Wurmy, Lamentation and Defiance were going for 1000-3000pp.  I lucked out cause yesterday I got the Centi LS for 500pp and today they were 3K, go figure!  I also saw a SS of Ykesha for 225pp so I picked that up for future use.<br />
<br />
1HB : I picked up a Shaded Staff for the low atk delay and super cheap price.  I only need to equip as primary to get skillups correct?  The Iksar Beserker said it would increase my target's stats when it proc'd does that mean me or what I am tryin to kill?<br />
<br />
2HB: Found a GreatStaff of Thunder for 150pp<br />
<br />
Pierce: Figured what the heck might as well train that too and got the Spider Fang.<br />
<br />
I think I am set on weaapons now and will turn my attention to gear next.<br />
<br />
Thank you all again  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Abividad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">On the club, it will increase your stats when it procs. <br />
<br />
You can get skill-ups with the weapon in your offhand, just slower than if it was in your main.<br />
<br />
Good deal on the Centi, grats</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Frostpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">If i were leveling my war from 25 to 40's again id look for a Reaver and only use 1handers for skillups.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>budtron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I recommend you try to find a  tribal warblade , its a 31 delay 23 dmg 2HS, no reomended or required level, plus 4 to str and plus 5 to wis i belive, im 21 atm and i seem to do pretty good with it. i got it for 3k at bazaar, pretty good deal i thought.<br />

       of topic -<br />

<br />
      i was just wondering, i picked up ( couple days after i started playing again after being away for about 6 months) an  earthshaker for only 700pp. when i left the game i remembered it going for like 40k+ so i figured id grab it, then i turned around and sold it for 19kpp and a phase spider carapace. did i get a good deal on it or was i ripped off a bit?(even though i cant rally be ripped off seeing how i only payed 700pp for it lmao).</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you got rid of one thing you didn't want for two things you did, that is always a good deal  :) <br />
<br />
Really though - good deal IMO.  Phase spider carapace sells 11K+ on Fennin Ro.  One dropped for my ranger but lost the roll.   :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Almost dinged 30 last night in Splitpaw.   Looking around for some questable gear to get me out and about a bit more.  Any suggestions are welcome.  <br />
<br />
Can't find a Dwarven smith for my Brellium.  One vendor in bazaar has a full set - each piece 10K up.  Not in my budget at the moment but hopefully later.  I am wondering how far will my Gothic Steel take me before I am just a mana sponge.  I suppose just fighting will answer that question in time.</div></div><hr />

Gratz on DING Girlie<br />
<br />
Quest check out the crafted stuff some of it maybe better than what you have. I really want to stress the Brellium for you I used it all the way to mid 50's and still have a piece or two I use. <br />
<br />
Good Luck  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Abividad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">The Brellium armor will have recommended level of 45 on it, so stats will eb less until you hit that. If Brellium armor is too expensive, I think the Fine Heraldic has the same stats as it, or reasonably close that Agnostics can wear.<br />
<br />
For right now upgrades, <br />
<br />
Crustacean Shell Greaves<br />
MAGIC ITEM  <br />
Slot: LEGS  <br />
AC: 12<br />
STR: +4  DEX: -4  STA: +16  CHA: -4  <br />
<br />
Crustacean Shell Boots<br />
MAGIC ITEM  <br />
Slot: FEET  <br />
AC: 10<br />
STR: +6  DEX: -2  STA: +12  CHA: -5  <br />
<br />
Crustacean Shell Helm<br />
MAGIC ITEM  <br />
Slot: HEAD  <br />
AC: 12<br />
STA: +10  CHA: -5  <br />
<br />
The AC is a bit less on them than the Gothic Steel, but all that stamina will boost your HP by a pretty fair amount. Crusty should be 100-300 PP per piece<br />
<br />
Crystal Spider Eyes for face: 2 less AC but add 35 raw HP. 300-500PP<br />
<br />
upgrade the Jagged Band to a Velium Fire Wedding ring, 6 Ac +65 HP 350ish PP<br />
<br />
Sad to say, this far into the life of EQ questing gear at mid-levels is not worth the effort. Back in the original game, people were doing the quests to make their crafted armor, but honestly I think the Gothic Steel is at least as good.</div></div><hr />

If you have a character around this level very nice exp killing griffs, bears, cats and wolves.  Additionally, for you tradeskillers, not one ruined pelt in the bunch.  I got 5 HQ Bear and immediately made Handmade Backpacks for my party.  Also, lots of HQ, MQ, LQ cat-wolf-bear to make into Leather Padding which is going for 800pp-1000pp  a stack on Fennin Ro.<br />
<br />
I didn't get a chance to sync my Magelo but I did update it this morning manually.  I found a vendor in the bazaar that was selling pieces of Underfoot.  Seemed to me Underfoot was comparable to Brellium.  I picked up the breastplate for 7500, bracer 2750 and greaves for 5000.  He had the boots and vambraces for 4000 each but ran out of money.  I hope he's still there in a coupla days.<br />
<br />
Was that just a crazy good deal?  Should I break the bank and buy those last two?</div></div><hr />

You are gonna hate me dear but you are agnostic and Underfoot is DIETY specific.:<br />
<br />

AC: 51<br />
STA: +5   WIS: +10   HP: +40   MANA: +40   <br />

Class: WAR CLR PAL <br />
Race: HEF DWF HFL GNM <br />
Deity: Brell Serilis <br />
<br />
That was why I suggested the Brellium it is the non diety specific made by same said dwarf smithy. My cleric hobbit wore the underfoot stuff but I had to wear the Brellium. I hate to be the bearer of bad news. <br />
<br />
ON a HAPPY NOTE <br />

If you're looking for tide-over armor in specific slots, you might search bazaar for barbed ringmail. Seems to go for around 1900 pp (very roughly, of course) per piece, often somewhat less and any race can wear it. It has more AC than gothic, much cheaper than BD armor. You'll replace it fairly soon, and it is ringmail not plate, but can be fill-in armor that's a bit of an upgrade over crafted/gothic.<br />
gauntlets are like 19AC, MR 5, HP +15<br />
legs 25AC, STR +3, STA +7<br />
Arms AC 20, DEX 3-ish, WIS (?)<br />
Chest is 30AC, STR 9, hp 50.<br />
<br />
Can't remember the rest, but it might be worth a search if you're looking at crafted in some slot and can't afford BD cultural yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Abividad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Crystal Chitin armor is also on a par with barbed Ringmail. And I wore a Barbed Ringmail on my chest until I was 55 and got a lucky Moktor BP drop. <br />
<br />
Too ban on the Diety armor. If you do decide to keep it and make a Cleric though, Don't make a halfling Cleric. They worship Bristlebane exclusively and wear Mischevious Platemail. I know this one, that's my g/f :)</div></div><hr />

32 in Mistmoore and Overthere.  Going pretty well with current gear.  I'll hold out for a while longer.  No one has bought my Underfoot, so I made myself a deal - no upgrades til that stuff sells  :D<br />

You need to be a premium member ( cheap $12/yr ) and downoad / use magelo update.<br />
<br />
<br />
Directly from magelo.com:<br />
If you have signed up for Premium Service, this option should be available to you in the Magelo Update program. Launch Magelo Update then play Everquest (just logging in will suffice) then exit the game. Once you see the character information displayed by Magelo Update, go to the Magelo menu and select Synchronize. Checkmark the characters you wish to have updated. Fill in your Magelo username and your password and hit the Synchronize button. This may take a few seconds depending on your connection speed. You're done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Narcy Mirrorgazer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I can't recommend Magelo enough.  Even with the occasional downtimes and the odd result from time to time, it makes managing my characters very easy.<br />
<br />
Oh, and all my Underfoot sold!  I made some more upgrades to Ms. Narcy resulting in a rather unattractive color scheme until I made an appointment with the local colorist in the bazaar  :D <br />
<br />
Still love, love, loving her.  Chewing thru LDoNs like they are candy.  <br />
<br />
Now, if I could just convince the other players to attack from the sides or back of the mob.   I lose hits while I turn things around for them since they wouldn't listen.  I won't even start to comment on the pally who kept taunting/stunning during the whole fight.  I finally just stood beside him so the rogue could get a little butt.<br />
<br />
After typing that I wondered if it was true - I mean, I don't actually have proof that other party members would do better damage from the back and sides.  Well, obviously the rogue does but what about the rest?  My assumption being that the mob might not have benefit of their full AC or at the very least not be able to parry/riposte.   Matter of fact I am not really all that informed on that type of mob behavior.   Any info or pointers to appropriate reading is welcome.    <br />
<br />
Making the effort not to be an ignorant @ss  :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Caldron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Yes not only is the DPS better from behind said mob but the others will not get riposte damage from behind or if the mob enrages they can continue to kill the mob while you sit there with attack off and suck up more damage. <br />
<br />
I did like 15 LDoN this weekend and at 62 and now 63 the mobs are enrageing on me where they were not before. <br />
<br />
Keep up the great work lil Hobbitess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Caldron's right.<br />
On my tank alts when I'm in LDoNs I usually mention that I will try to position mob with its back to any pets in the group. That gives rogue/other melee a place to stand, and it makes a bit of sense because it's a bit hard to quickly reposition pets. There's usually time to talk to your group about this just before you go in the dungeon, while buffing is happening.<br />
If there are no pets, it's actually often faster for everyone else to move rather than you to move the mob. But yes, it's good when everyone else is behind mob. Even better if everyone else will watch push and back up if mob starts going into a wall.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Narcy Mirrorgazer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">while you sit there with attack off and suck up more damage. <br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;noobalert&gt;<br />
<br />
That comment reminded me of some enrage questions lingering in the back of my brain.  Excuses follow  :D <br />
<br />
As I am fairly young in my EQ career and my main, 59 Ranger, is just starting to see ENRAGE messages whilst she plinks arrows into the mob from afar... what is afoot here?  I've also died twice to enrage even though I would swear I was well behind the mob.  Did it turn to whack me when the MT disengaged?   What is that warrior who is protecting my tender parts doing when things ENRAGE?  I get the basics that enrage means every hit is riposted...but seems there may be more going on here...<br />
<br />
I have only begun to raid and the Raid Leader has been assigning a &quot;tank for rage&quot;  along with MT and the tank order.   Is the range tank taunting aggro off the MT when he disengages?  How could that possibly work with half the raid force whacking on the mob hindparts?   Arrg, it's all so much to absorb at once.  Help?   <br />
<br />
&lt;/noobalert&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Caldron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">From my understanding and it is limited but here goes... In the LDoN's and named I have tanked the MT facing the mob has aggro (or he is dead LOL) and when enrage message flashes he turns off attack. The people behind the mob can continue to attack during it but and here is the big BUT if the others happen to get aggro the mob will turn. In my cases I had sufficent aggro and also hit that taunt button and incite when I could and the mob kept facing me. <br />
<br />
I have not been in a raid large enough to have a rage tank so I am currious about this as well.</div></div><hr />

I'd focus on haste and a fast weapon that will proc aggro soon for your mainhand,or, a good ratio 2 hander without a level requirement like the reaver that was mentioned.How much are frostbringers now?Those and the troll forged ykesha's would be great  and much better when they start to proc ,around 35 I think.</div></div><hr />

Hey, thanks =)  She is receiving the benefits from her mom, Mavean's  (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=836939) hand me downs.  Mavean can use some work but she gets along pretty well.  I am pretty happy to help Narcy along - though she's been a nice little earner for me in her own right.  Trying to transition Narcy into questing and   earning all her next round of upgrades where possible.   Her bracer was a LDoN drop.<br />

I have a short sword of ykesha - that will proc for me at 37.  I have a copper hammer of striking in the bank for later.  I was thinking of trying to kill where the truncheon of doom drops - 50% slow I've heard.  So much to look for!  <br />

Enjoying the journey so far, making sure my exp bar isn't my fun meter.</div></div><hr />

The troll honed ykeshas are made by troll smiths.I believe they use the ssoy's to smith the improved version.Depending on deity(or lack there of) the improved ratio's are like 12/22 and 12/21 some with ac and stats.<br />
<br />
Just an idea hehe.If I was starting up a twink warrior frostbringer/troll yak would sound like good aggro to me.Good luck.</div></div><hr />

Ah, you are correct.  Thanks.  <br />
