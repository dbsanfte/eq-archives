<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sarcazzm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">It seems that Iksar Monks, SK's, and Shamans at least all get alternate epics, and they all seem to be pretty nice. Does anyone know of one for a warrior? the pike quests certainly do NOT seem to finish with anything worthwhile, leading me to believe it is similar to coldain rings or shackles, with all but the last couple sucking pretty bad. At any rate, i am going to do the pikes and see if i can find anything else about them, as i have never seen/heard of this alternate epic and quite frankly if its worth a damn i have no reason to get my Jagged blade of war.<br />
<br />
anyone have any info? it definately sounds interesting to say the least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Pike quests is all I've heard of. The last one was pretty good IIRC but it was never discovered in-game.. was found through link-hacking. Also iirc the next-to-last and possible third-to-last were never discovered in game either.<br />
<br />
Here is a good Unsolved Quests forum:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>tongpo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have finished the pike quests. The legionairre's Macatcher is the last known weapon in the Pike series. Ive done countless hours of research trying to find info about any possible upgrades. The merchant that sells the pieces of the upgrades but there is no known info about them. This leads me to believe that either the quest is either undiscovered or broken. If you find any info please feel free to follow up. I will be doing this quest as long as I am playing EQ</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>CyrzB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Same here. I did my Mancatcher out of a pure desire to see it through, I have never wielded it in battle.<br />
<br />
On another note... The Veksar Patch mentioned something about &quot;Klok Someone&quot; is taking some kind of pies or something now. And there is a new Quest NPC in LOIO that fleshes out some lore, which suggests some new quests in Cabilis.<br />
<br />
Also, the new Quest NPC in LOIO offers another way to get Cabilis Faction.... suggesting that it might be important to get? Maybe just because Cabilis is the closest city to Veksar.</div></div><hr />
