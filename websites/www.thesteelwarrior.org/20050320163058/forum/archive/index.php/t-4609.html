<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nytewolf</div><div class="date">12-06-2003, 01:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Q: I'm still confused about Endurance. Will it completely replace Stamina? How will that affect swimming? <br />
<br />
A: Yes, Endurance will completely replace Stamina. Some of the occasions that used Stamina in the old system will no longer require the expenditure of a resource. For example, swimming will no longer use a resource. <br />
<br />
<br />
Q: If jumping costs Endurance, and only melee classes and hybrids have Endurance... won't that be a problem for casters when they want to jump? <br />
<br />
A: All classes get an Endurance bar and an Endurance pool. So everyone can still jump. <br />
<br />
<br />
Q: I understand that the new combat skills and all disciplines will use Endurance, and that's why Endurance won't be affected by any spells that currently affect Stamina. But why remove the Stamina effects from those spells? Some classes gain some value to their group through the use of those spells. <br />
<br />
A: Since we are removing Stamina, there won't be any value to spells that affect Stamina. <br />
<br />
There will be additional spells added that modify Endurance. Right now these will be buffs that increase your total pool. We are not planning on adding any that would regenerate the pool. These spells will be tuned to balance the ability to aid in the return of Endurance. Just exchanging the Stamina effects with Endurance effects wouldn't allow us any control over the balance of the new system and its interaction with spells. It hasn't been decided which classes will get those spells yet, but obviously we'll be taking into consideration the effects of the changes to the existing spells might have on caster desirability. <br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Will NPCs be using these new abilities? <br />
<br />
A: Not at this time. Frankly, there's a lot of work involved in allowing NPCs to use these abilities, and it would have a rather wide-spread effect on the challenge of those NPCs that would be complicated to evaluate. So we're only giving this to PCs. <br />
<br />
<br />
Q: There seems to be some confusion about how these new skills will be used. Will we be clicking a button on the screen with our mouse, or can we make hotbuttons with the new skills and just press a key to activate them? <br />
<br />
A: You will be able to click on the icons, use hotbuttons in your hotbutton box or access a melee skills box only for these abilities through CTRL+ #. <br />
<br />
<br />
Q: You mentioned that you are making some other changes to melee, including giving warriors an automatic mitigation percentage. Will PC warriors of all levels get this ability? <br />
<br />
A: PC warriors of all levels will gain the mitigation boost. <br />
<br />
<br />
Q: These changes look very interesting. But some of us are concerned that these changes might overbalance things. What steps are you taking to keep the balance pendulum from swinging too far toward the pure melee classes? <br />
<br />
A: We'll be testing this system on the Test server until it goes Live. The big advantage of the system is the flexibility. Adjusting it won't require days of programmer time. If we discover that a facet of the new skills is over or under powered, we can adjust it. <br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Regarding the new discipline system using Endurance: will it be possible to stop a disc midway through its use when it doesn't make sense to keep it up, in order to save some Endurance? <br />
<br />
A: Yes, you will be able to stop a discipline while it is active. If you cancel a discipline, however, you must still wait the normal recharge time before using it again. <br />
<br />
<br />
Q: You mentioned that these new skills will be learned by finding ancient tomes. Will these tomes be No Drop? <br />
<br />
A: Right now the plan is to introduce them as droppable. There may be some tomes that result from special quests that are no-drop in the future. <br />
<br />
<br />
Anyone seen a hige problem with those tomes being droppable? You thought wiz/shm spells were exspensive bend over boys were about to get raped on prices on these bad boys. =)<br />
