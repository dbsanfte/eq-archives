<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vykk</div><div class="date">09-21-2004, 11:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I couldnt find a thread dealing with the best class to 2 box a warrior... It seams that there are so many... <br />
<br />
I currently have a 57 war and 56 cleric on one account  (along with various other 50+'s  and i have a problem, I can never, and I mean never find groups...  I work odd hours and nights so a guild to group with is unfortunately out of the question. <br />
<br />
But enough of the sob story...<br />
<br />
I guess my question is if I were to get another account (eq platinum is quite cheap) would the cleric I have be the best partner for  a new warrior, or should I lvl a new shaman up to partner with my warrior?  <br />
<br />
I have a 52 druid that can help with the lower lvl powerlvling, and I would like to keep a warrior, cleric combo (saving up for a tod) but Im more concerned with what would be best to try and get to 60+ and garner some aa's.<br />
<br />
Any advice would be greatly appreciated</div></div><hr />

Cleric has rez and heals the best, but has very little utility, Shaman has slow and more utility, but doesn't heal that well.  Druid is a good balance of healing and utility.  Since you already have the cleric I would just go with that.  No other class is enough better to warrant leveling a new character, and with a ToD a cleric is hard to beat.  Having rez is very nice.  Main drawback to the war/cleric (that's what I do when I 2-box) is lack of invis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alisdahre</div><div class="date">09-21-2004, 11:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also, with the cleric/war combo, you'll be able to pull singles using pacify in a large number of areas.  The shaman/warrior combo would have to either find easier to pull hunting areas, or you'll be tanking multiple 70% slowed mobs at once.<br />
<br />
If you can get your hands on a Truncheon of Doom and some Cobalt Greaves, you'll be sitting beautifully.  You can invis others with the Greaves.  Failing that, an Incarnadine BP for the warrior and potions/vanishing devices for the cleric, or potions/devices for both would be great utilities to keep stocked at all times.</div></div><hr />

I duo with my shaman so I have to take healing capabilities and no snare into consideration. At 65 on both I could duo in POI all day long with no clarity or virtue. Still doing that at 66 during deadtimes. Most of the mobs are still blue with the occasional lt blue. Could probably do some tier 2 stuff but I kinda like the cruise control exp in tier 1 plus a couple adds don't cause as much of a problem.</div></div><hr />

It can get a little tough at times, but slow is great, heal is OK and clicky pants for root are good.  Plus DOT's and dogdog with pet weapons are great.</div></div><hr />
