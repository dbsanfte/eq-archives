<br />
Also, who is going to be the Admin?  <br />
<br />
Are all the moderators still active?  I think I've seen all of them except Xexys lately.<br />
<br />
Just playing around with the board features, ignore plz =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yeah i'll set all the old mods as mods here too, along with a couple of the more active posters.<br />
<br />
The board titles have been moved,i'm going to go through and account for the post counts i can find of people from ezboard and artificially inflate them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xexys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Nah. Unfortunatley, I'm still here. ;)<br />
<br />
I've been on the boards. Maybe you been drinkin' too much of that crazy Halas ale. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>arative</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">wont be able to copy over post count, but custom titles would be cool. oh and adding outwar to list of banned words is a must!</div></div><hr />

<br />
You could be right.  Only thing I can think of to do about it is have another one tho.<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />
<br />
<br />
And we can't automatically transfer over post counts, but they can be changed manually<br />
<br />
&lt;~~:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">heh my post count is a bit low....... :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Korak Sarathai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I never got around to requesting one, but I would like my title to read: Old School<br />
<br />
I can provide a screen of my birthdate, April 27, 1999.  I don't mind if others have that title too, as long as they are confirmed born in 1999.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'm about 100 posts light too, but no big deal, I can do that in no time =)  just didn't want to start all over.  :cool: <br />
<br />
And right now you can change your title yourself.  I dunno if we'll go back to the 500 posts for a custom title or not but atm everybody sets their own.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>arative</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">where do you set your own title?<br />
<br />
and not that it matters but I have 328 posts on the old board</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I added a few of the members posts...what i did was just look for the first post with that persons name, and put that number (i forgot ezboard doesnt globally update).<br />
<br />
Anyway some are off, most arent even done. If it bugs ya much, can pm me and i'll update :P</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Garyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">i think the post counts can be done manually, it would take some work though <br />
<br />
<br />
another board i post on has switched boards about 5 times and carried posts throughout..<br />
<br />
<br />
the original change was from VNboards to UBB though and someone had to manually type in the post counts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Dinian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Only weak people care about their post counts!<br />

Time to come up with useful material for 12 more posts, no 11.<br />
<br />
Maybe I can espouse the virtues of Barb women in that other thread?<br />
<br />
Then you must label me &quot;Old School&quot;<br />

And you still owe me a snowball, Shik.</div></div><hr />

Sounds like Roehm's been out away from the women folk a bit too long.  Of course, half elven men do look very feminine.</div></div><hr />

how did you all get your post counts back?  <br />
<br />
By sending a PM to a moderator.  Go to the main page, click on forum leaders in the upper right corner, and send a PM to somebody on the Administrators list with your old post count (and Title if you had one).<br />
<br />
<br />
And Bigemnose?  There's nothing honorable about having Five's boot surgically removed from your ass :D.</div></div><hr />

Not being able to retreat and not retreating are two finely separated things.  The fact that your meager allies burn the bridges behind you is a testiment to that. <br />

The only warrior that even comes close to matching the sheer power of the Troll is the Ogre.  Can you honestly tell me that you think a bunch of frogs could over take a city of trolls for which obviously would have high level shadowknights, warriors, and shamans?????  No way in hell!
