I can see having the pallys as MT and use there stuns to hold the mob in place and keeping it stunned...makes sense<br />
<br />
In raids, the 2 MT WARRIORS, my self and the other are the MT, SA, then the palllys become 3A,4A...if needed...<br />
<br />
On holding aggro from a pally,  not that hard..if the pally knows there class, then you have a challange on your hands if you want it..Most pallys I run into dont want the aggro...You take it..<br />
<br />
If your caster classes KNOW WHEN to cast so they dont get Instance aggro on pulls, then they need to be told..and they figure it out soon....<br />
<br />
<br />
Im assuming all of your skills are maxed at lv 60 plus, IM 63 atm of this post...<br />
<br />
What am I missing about the class balancing...The hybrids have spells, we dont you knew that in making the character..should they increase DISC times, yes.. they can do more with that<br />
<br />
Alot of the Pally AA &amp; SK AA are inbalanced, made a pally just to look, Dragon roar immune, should be a resist..say higher percentage...<br />
<br />
Guess since IM not in the Tier 3 planes, just got into BOT, so IM not seeing the reasons why you peeps are bitching...Love the Bagdad Bob sigs though...so something must be true there..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have you ever had anyone send you a tell after they slowed on incoming ...&quot;Dont you taunt?&quot;<br />
<br />
Have you ever had someone say in group &quot;Oh a warrior tank better get my root up?&quot;<br />
<br />
Have you ever had a shammy say to a group &quot;Oh a warrior I guess I'll be tanking a lot in this dungeon&quot;<br />
<br />
All these comments are made mostly before I can prove any aggro control what so ever. <br />
<br />
I do not high end raid. Heck I barely raid at all. This is a warriors pain from a LFG stand point. I think raids have their own set of woes which you can read anywhere on these boards.<br />
<br />
Why we whine....I am positive no Pally or SK has heard these comments lately. Im pretty sure from my experience that no pallys and sk's are saving up dungeon points to put on their weapons just to do their job properly. <br />
<br />
It's very frustrating.<br />
<br />
Oh Oh on a happy note....watched a pally eat it on a mob &quot;immune to stun&quot; last night :) Warrior popped over and tanked it down.  Im still glowing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valeris</div><div class="date">10-11-2003, 11:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's a complicated combination of things and the emphasis of the complaints is on experience groups where people choose one tank type to the exclusion of others. <br />
<br />
With the warrior monopoly on exp. tanking comprehensively  broken (and I have to say rightly so) there is much more room for complaint over the lack of secondary capability the class brings (imagine if you were a third warrior and not required to Tank on a raid). With groups not needing to work with aggro anymore when using a knight that can take the hits, the warrior is now by many considered a third class choice - something of a bitter pill for the class who's central concept is to tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">10-11-2003, 11:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye, we're third choice for experience group tank and about 10th choice for experience group DPS.

<br />
You know, I get that head-shaking, sinking-pit-of-the-stomach feeling when I encounter classes that DON'T have their root up.<br />
<br />
Root is useful in that it helps distribute aggro among people experienced enough to play with it.<br />
<br />
Root is useful in that it can be used for crowd control.<br />
<br />
Root is useful in that it can stop a runner when snare is unavailable or snare has been &quot;forgotten.&quot;<br />
<br />
It makes me sad when a rooting class either doesn't have it up or doesn't bother to use it.<br />
<br />
It makes me mad when I'm in a group and someone (or multiple someones) die because root wasn't up or wasn't bothered with.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I'm a stop ranting now.<br />
<br />
But when someone is actually annoyed that they have to use root, like the someone your quote is referencing ... well it just makes me think that they're not thinking too much.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rhaille</div><div class="date">10-12-2003, 12:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Last night I went to Tactics for the first time, 2 Main tanks and a Pally, He was 3rd assist...<br />
<br />
Also did a Tower boss in BOT, Bigger raid...2 Main tanks, 4 Pallys....they were still behind me in assist..If they are better, then Why were they before me in the ranks of assisting...Espically when it comes to Tower bosses???, shit stun the mob to oblivian!! (Yeah I laughed when the pallys stuns DONT work...)<br />
<br />
Guess our guild still holds Tanks in Higher reguards then pallys, then again Ive mostly XP in guilds, been in 3 guilds, 2 broke up and are less than there former-selves. Havent really done a lot of pickup group-xping..and then and only then have I been second fiddle or third when I was the lower level of the melees in the group....<br />
<br />
Gear wise, All of my visible peices are Helenic Tundra, same gear from my late 50's.. Some no drop peices mixed in with Kizar Gauntles (Ornate drop)..many NO-Drop weapons from the Named in Umbral plains, in fact all of them...<br />
<br />
Then with the rooting...If a caster draws aggro with a big nuke, HE BETTER DAMN well relize he made a mistake!! and sometimes they pay with death! (Not my fault, I taunt, I Mash that key always unless Im 2nd or third)...and if a caster class is so Uber, why do most of the have a root spell and have to use a pet to do the tanking...most of the guides are root &amp; nuke...then send in the pets!<br />
<br />
Ive never seen a shammy tank.....Shammys are a Utility class, they Buff, debuff &amp; Heal...ok sick you pet in to help...Yeah also tanking a Casters pet, we get our asses handed to us, remeber they can buff the pet up!..um to what extent can we buff ourselves...ok a little haste/ac/hps....thats all remeber that..get a shammy &amp; cleric to buff you if you want to challange a caster class pet..<br />
<br />
Maybe, and this is my opinion...your in some groups that dont understand how to use there class correctly...maybe at one time the warrior was KING of the hill...not anymore...and also dont forget the underlying niceness there is in the game, anyone can say anything about anyone and whats it the recource..nothing<br />
<br />
Are you guys looking to do 4K of damage on a hit, if so become a caster class, if your looking to sort of melee, become a Ranger..<br />
<br />
In any Fantasy role playing game..Ive played D&amp;D for over 20 years, the warrior has never out damaged any caster class...<br />
<br />
In the Military..Its the infantry (Us) that do the dirty work and the suppost staff does the heavy stuff...Navy/Airforce (Casters)....(Where the hell is this guy coming from your thinking), but its true...even in medevil times...infantry did its job the hard slow way and the support...Archers/Trebuches/boiling oil/whatever did theres, yeah they had bigger results....SO what im saying if you try to keep some realism in the warrior class..that is us, this isnt final fantasy or soul caliber II...its everquest...</div></div><hr />

It makes me look even worse when a caster will root the mob, then stand there and get whacked on instead of moving, or the rogue that believes he's got to be as close to the rooted mob as he can be to backstab it, then wonders why he's getting the snot kicked outta him.  Of course they're standing there wondering why taunt isn't working.....</div></div><hr />

I would suggest that you get down on your knees and thank whatever lucky star it is you seem to be born under.  I would suggest that before you start hurling invictives at others, you walk a mile in our shoes.  I would suggest, NOT blowing off the posts and the collective experience of the warriors that post here just because YOU have not been passed over in a group for a paladin.  Many of the warriors that post here have been playing their warrior longer than me, and I started May 2000.  I would suggest a stroll through ALL the other class boards in which you will find threads about the problems of the warrior class.  But most of all, I would suggest not lecturing us, unless you want to start another flame war in which poor Shik will have to get out the MIGHTYTALK (tm) again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Im not in anyways trying to start a flame war by any means....<br />
<br />
Yes I have been passed over by a Pally/SK only because I think that they were higher than me by a few lvls...(I think), or that AA title...Duke and Im still a Baron...almost a veteran...<br />
<br />
Another thing ive noticed with the taunting, our MT 65 and a lot more AA then me, I can pull his aggro off and we can make the mob ping pong...that isnt right and yes it should be fixed, but that is a tank vs. tank issue...who is hitting harder, crits...amount of hits...<br />
<br />
I will watch for more of these things that you guys are talking about, but the guild IM in, we seem to focus more on our individual job and do that...split if told by the puller, assist when called...we have some order most of the time...maybe the people your grouping with, and yes I have had that experience also are cluster fucks and dont know when to cast correctly because the SOLO to much and think...Shit I can him myself...!!!<br />
<br />
And also I group almost everyday with the same people...so we have learned how to group the classes together and time things.../kneel...p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lovax</div><div class="date">10-12-2003, 07:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Rhaille, if you are mashing taunt every time it pops you're making a mistake.  Go read some of the taunt threads if you want, else I will do a quick summary.<br />
<br />
taunting when you have agro gets you nothing because taunt will pull you up to the highest agro spot + &quot;some very small amount&quot;.<br />
<br />
It is much better to save taunt for when you lose agro so you have a chance to pull it back before the mob even hits whoever drew agro.<br />
<br />
I think that is what was ment more then feeling responsible for someone else over agroing, it's not just them that's screwing up, it's you as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lynetta</div><div class="date">10-12-2003, 07:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">a story.......<br />
<br />
Once upon a time.....casters would not overnuke because they didnt want to get hit, shammy's would wait for a slow and a frostbringer would guantee aggro...<br />
<br />
Then the darkness fell......mobs began to hit for horrible amounts of damage, everything and its uncle began to summon.  <br />
<br />
Then low and behold a Paladin got KEI and began to stun and keep stunning. The wizard said, &quot;hey I can nuke all the time&quot;, The shaman said, &quot;wow I can slow on inc&quot;  <br />
<br />
The shaman and the wizard began to spread their dark tellls among the masses. The shadowknight heard the whisper and said, &quot;Gee I wonder if my spells will do that?&quot; The shadowknight got aggro and low and behold the wizard nuked and the shammy slowed and the whispers continued.<br />
<br />
The warrior, strong and brave continued to stand between the evil hordes of mobs and the casters. THEN, he looked behind him and they had gone. &quot;Where oh where had the casters gone?&quot;<br />
The warrior looked and looked until he finally heard the dark whispers. He followed the whispers and THERE he found the casters all fat and happy with their KEI and FT nuking and slowing as soon as they wanted. He said &quot;Why haste thou forsaken me, have I not tanked for thee and kept thee from harm?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Burp&quot; replied the casters, &quot;Fat exp rocks!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
And so the warrior called to his God, &quot;Sony I have been been brave and I have been pure...can you help me&quot;<br />
<br />
And there was silence....<br />
<br />
So, the warrior sits, silent tears streaming down his face and awaits his God's answer. <br />
<br />
Hopefully NOT ...the end.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">10-12-2003, 07:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since when did you feel responsible for some caster gettin hit and he got summoned<br />
Since knights became the preferred choice of XP group tank and the expectation of the average levelled from 1 to 65 in 3 months PoP n00b who is putting together a group in BoT is that the tank will cast a couple of high agro spells as the mob is inc so the slower can slow it as soon as it gets to camp and the nukers can nuke as soon as it gets to camp and no one ever gets agro.<br />
<br />
Sure thats a bit of an over-simplification of it, but thats pretty much the problem.<br />
<br />
Back when most groups had a warrior tanking (and I'll admit as a class we had it pretty good, though we still spent a shitload of time LFG cos there were so damn many of us) the expectation was if you nuke early or slow early then you'll get summoned and you'll get hit.  Thats how it was and players learned to deal with it.  Now that you can level 50-65 in a month or 2 rather than the month per level or so it used to take, and theres a huge number of new players coming through who have levelled up used to having a tank who can &quot;agro lock&quot; the mob, the expectation has changed.<br />
<br />
Why is it the casters fault he drew agro when if they had a different class tanking he wouldnt have drawn agro?  It always used to be the whole groups responsibility to not pull agro off the tank, but now that mobs hit so much harder and the penalty for drawing agro is much higher the solution for alot of players is rather than manage their own agro, just get a knight to tank.<br />
<br />
If you have the luxury of grouping with the same people all the time or always getting guild groups then thats great and what alot of warriors consider a class balance problem probably doesn't effect you, but that doesn't mean its not there.<br />
<br />
As for raiding, thats a totally situation and courtesy of our 3 minutes of fame disc warriors are still a pretty popular choice to MT / MA on raids, though its getting posted here more and more that knights are chosen to tank ahead of warriors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">10-12-2003, 07:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What is being described is simply a bunch of incompetent groups in action.  There will not be a fix to help you get into more incompetent groups so people don't have to learn how to play EQ at all.<br />
<br />
The warrior class has problems but honestly unless you're playing Hard LDoN adventures or harder kind of situations I don't think you can really say 'there is absolutely nothing I could have done on that situation because my aggro sucks'.  Not having enough aggro is when you do two enraging blows ona mob and it still pasted your Enchanter who was at 100% health.  It's not so your shaman can slow on incoming (which btw, is never necessary if your healer is awake).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">10-12-2003, 08:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What is being described is simply a bunch of incompetent groups in action. There will not be a fix to help you get into more incompetent groups so people don't have to learn how to play EQ at all.<br />
I disagree with you there Phantron.  Yes I described a situation of what could be considered an incompetent group, but from my recent pick up group experience it seems to be the standard rather than the exception.  <br />
<br />
Back when your average XP group in Seb yielded 1 blue an hour and grinding out a level in your 50's meant spending 20+ hours XPing in a dungeon where you had to manage your agro every kill you would get the occasional over agroing caster, but they tended to learn within a level or so how to play without getting splattered.  Incompetent groups were pretty rare.<br />
<br />
I don't really think its fair to call every shaman who expects to be able to slow the mob on inc, and every caster who expects to be able to nuke from when they first see the mob incompetent as to have that expectation they have clearly been playing in an environment where to do so doesn't get you killed.  I would say instead that the game has evolved to the point where &quot;snap agro&quot; is something that alot of players expect their tank to have and that the warrior class has not evolved with it.<br />
<br />
It is not that the newer generation of EQ players, the ones who levelled from 50-65 in PoP, hasn't learned to play EQ at all, but that the EQ that they have learned to play is different to the EQ that those who levelled up during Kunark / Velious / SoL learned to play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">10-12-2003, 08:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Phantron, your arguement is weak.  Basically it amounts to you saying if we play with skilled and knowledgeable players at all times, we'll do fine.  Yes, you're right.  If we play with skilled and knowledgeable players at all times we will do fine.  However, most of the skilled and knowledgeable players say, in essence, fek that shite, get me a Paladin.<br />
<br />
Why?  Because they don't like having to deal with all the extra overhead a Warrior represents to their play style, and the slower experience as a result.<br />
<br />
So telling us to just go out and find a competent group is saying, just don't bother playing.  Because the competent groups aren't taking us, in droves.<br />
<br />
Now I know someone will come along and counter, &quot;Oh nos Mr. Glatius, I never have a problem getting a group!  My entire guild takes turns grouping me cause I'm just so Ubah!  And when I go LFG I'm immediately snapped up cause everyone on the server knows what a nifty cool tank I am and they lub me!&quot;<br />
<br />
All I can say to that is, you live in a charmed world bud.  The rest of us have to deal with reality.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mvreena</div><div class="date">10-12-2003, 08:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">All I have to say is I love my new rogue twink.  She just sits at the back of the mob and backstabs.  Not a damn thing she can do when the tank loses agro.  No more fretting about the slower, the healer, etc.... :p <br />
<br />
And Phantron, yes what is being described would have been considered incompetent pre PoP.  With the advent of PoP they are very much the norm.  Since PoP, players have LEARNED how to play their classes with a KNIGHT tank.  Since the fast majority of players would rather kill as many mobs as they can, in the fastest amount of time, without having to worry about aggro, it is now the NORM.<br />
<br />
Railing against fate, saying that the newer players don't know how to play their char won't change those facts.  Why should they relearn how to play their char in order to help a warrior keep aggro when they don't have to?  All they have to do is replace the warrior with a knight for a tank.  Problem solved. Therefore, it can be said, &quot;'There is absolutely nothing I could have done on that situation because my aggro sucks', when compared to a knight&quot;</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Korinn</div><div class="date">10-12-2003, 09:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Rhaille you really need go through alot of the threads on these boards and others as well. <br />
<br />
Im not sure you understand the significant differnce between a raid MT and a group MT<br />
<br />
Much of what you are talking about is raid MTing such as lcea, and BoT tower minis and in that warriors will almost be chosen ahead of pally every single time for 2 reasons. 1st, the defensive disc and  2nd at the raid level your talking about wars have a large HP advantage over pally's. <br />
<br />
What the problem is that simply put, in exp groups Pally and SK &gt; you. <br />
<br />
At no point in your future career (unless balancing and itemization get fixed) as an exp tank will you even come close to being as good a tank as a pally that has similar lvl gear or even just below.<br />
<br />
Knight classes can generate taunt early on in a fight that you will have no chance of matching.<br />
<br />
Often the large HP gaps between pally's and wars will mean the war will be the tank but by doing this your group will kill at a slower rate and often use more mana healing casters or slowers because a nuke or a slow grabbed taunt.<br />
<br />
On a side note after answering a few of your questions Rhaille i found most of your post to be absolute drivel. You have never seen a shammy tank? I'd be willing to bet that many a shaman has tanked in your groups. Its been a LONG time since i've seen anyone so uninformed in how other classes in the group relate to him and it shows in your attitude.<br />
<br />
My advice, read through every thread on this board, shut up till you get an idea, learn to ask intelligent questions and keep the non essential shit out of the post. Take note of what people post cause i can guarantee that almost everyone on the boards has a greater knowledge of the warrior and other classes than you.<br />
<br />
If i was the MT at the raid you were ping ponging mobs on, you would be told to leave and ported out. Learn to manage your agro.<br />
<br />
oh and dont mash taunt, if you have taunt it does nothing, if you have taunt then lose it the taunt button is ready to be pressed again and you dont have to wait for refresh.</div></div><hr />

Of course the Knights are still infinitely better with their aggro lock, but the issue isn't your own inadequcies.  With the strange way aggro works in LDoN I even see Knights fail to get aggro sometimes, especially if they're not trying very hard.  Doesn't mean they somehow needed a boost from their already ridiculous amounts of aggro they can generate.  <br />
<br />
If you think Warrior aggro is inadequate for xping in BoT or whatever, never ever try anything where warrior aggro really is inadequate.  You don't really know what inadequate aggro is until you have to memblur and root every mob you mez so it wouldn't instantly kill the Enchanter.</div></div><hr />

Just because someone is infinitely better than you does not make you inadequate.  A charmed pet in LDoN makes any DPS class inadequate (~400 DPS on normal, and 500-1000 DPS depending on how crazy your Enchanter is on hard).  But that doesn't mean everyone needs to do 2 times more damage to make up for it.  Groups still exist and function without charmed pets, and the difference between a petless group versus one with pet is far more than the one between a warrior tank and a paladin tank.  <br />
<br />
For all of you saying how it's so bad with a warrior, have you ever had a time where you had to fight mobs unslowed because if the enchanter slowed it, he'd either:<br />
<br />
1.  Die<br />
2.  Run out of mana from trying to Boggle/Memblur, and then die<br />
<br />
If you had this happen to you, then I think you're qualified to say a Warrior slows down the group, but I really doubt this is happening on your PoP XP grinds.</div></div><hr />

We were under the misimpression that Warriors were the clearly third choice tanking class with no utility to compensate for that lack of desireability.  From what you say it's now clear that not only do we have it wrong, so do all the other classes who have come right out and said that Warriors in today's game suck.<br />
<br />
We don't suck, everyone else does.  And they should learn to play to accommodate us and ditch the Paladin or Shadow Knight, damn gimps.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chavr</div><div class="date">10-13-2003, 11:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I could tell you how the bot group I was in this weekend got a warrior to MT and I pulled and root parked any adds.  I could mention how the cleric stated plainly that having the warrior tank was much easier on her mana and worked better for the group as a whole then having me tank.  I could tell you how the warrior had about 400 more hp then me so the difference wasn't because of that.<br />
<br />
I could tell you how my guild only uses paladins for tanking IV and that's it.  I could talk about the fact that warriors have always been our MT even when our paladins were getting close to them in max hp's.<br />
<br />
I don't reckon I will though because the propoganda machine that is running would just play it off as an isolated experience and that what is common for the 9 warriors and 2 paladins in my guild is just a fluke in the game.  Obviously what I'm seeing as normal isn't really normal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 02:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Right, we should take what you see as normal as being true and accurate while disregarding what we see as normal.  Because of course your perceptions of a class you don't play are in all probability far more accurate, just as you believe us when we talk about the Paladin class.  Because of course since we don't play the class our perceptions are far more accurate than your own, right?</div></div><hr />

<br />
People who dont play our class DO no more about how the public views us ... we arnt the public, were the display the public is critiqueing.<br />
<br />
So if someone comes along and tells me that in reality, most classes still do want warriors to tank, when they are there, because of our innate ability to take damage better than knights.  We take less damage, and not always because we have more HP than knights, just because we take less, period.  We mitigate and avoid more than knights, and clerics will be the first to tell you this.  Read the cleric boards, they would rather be healing a warrior than a knight, they are just too frightened at what the rest of EQ would think if they let it get out.<br />
<br />
We are still the tanking kings.  The public knows this, and we should to.  <br />
<br />
Daily I hear guild mates talking about how bad this or that tank is, and you know, it doesnt come down to if he plays bad or not, its generally &quot;SoandSo has less HP than a nakid chanter&quot;, which says he really is overstretching his arms, trying to grab at EXP he shouldnt be getting yet.<br />
<br />
Its not the warrior class as a whole thats damaged our image.  Its the select few out there, that PL their way to the top, dont have the gear to befit their level, nor the weapons, and are trying to tank in a place they heard was c00l because they read it somewhere, or some guy said it was neat.<br />
<br />
Its the idiots who shouldnt be there in the first place that ruin it for everyone else.  <br />
<br />
Like everything ... EQ has its grapevine.  Just like the media, we focus on the bad, and because of such, it takes a lot more good to override the image, because we arnt looking for it.  We are too concerned with finding another complaint to make us look even worse, because my friends, like it or not, we have subconciously been subverted by the propoganda that we tried so hard to keep in.<br />
<br />
Again this falls into the realm, its not us thats broken, its people who dont know how to play that make it seem that way.  If said idiot with 3khp unbuffed tries to tank towers in BoT, because he can get there, and sucks at it, dont blame his class, blame his idiocy for thinking because someone with near triple his HP said he could that means idiots can too.<br />
<br />
Im elemental capable, but i still know where i should and shouldnt be.  I Know I can tank in BoT, but does that mean that a fresh 62 with 3k buffed can.  I Know I can tank raid mobs, with the right people there to back me up, but theres mobs i know i cant.  I refused (Up till today anyway) to tank anything in the elementals, because i know id get my ass handed to me (was too stupid to bid on anything but 1 handers, cause i never thought i needed em, thnx HP for giving me a Norge'Tal for my birthday today), waiting till your there to realize you need a 2hander worth a shit is a bad idea.  <br />
<br />
The same should be true of EXP groups.  I Know where i should and shouldnt be.  Tanking elementals with 1 handers, i shouldnt be doing it in EXP groups, i take too much damage.  So i stayed out.  <br />
<br />
People these days should know when they are getting beaten into the ground, that is what is wrong with the game now.  To many people trying to reach too high too fast, and they are bringing the rest of us down when they fall.<br />
<br />
They dont need to change the classes, they need to reinstate the barriers they set up beforehand, so people actually have to work to go to the places they guard.  Everyone doesnt deserve to be everywhere, because in gaining access to those places, you readied yourself to actually fight there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Please link some of these threads, because what I read on the Cleric board, and I do read it from time to time, seems to me to be the exact opposite.  The Clerics admit that Warriors take a beating somewhat better than the Knights, but not nearly enough better to warrant using one.  What they really hate is extremely low HP tanks trying to tank someplace they don't belong.  But that can just as easily be a Warrior as it can a Knight.  <br />
<br />

<br />
This alone makes me question your perspective.  It's obvious your not a run of the mill Warrior based on that statement alone.<br />
<br />

<br />
Yet these people can replace a Warrior with a Knight and not get beaten into the ground.  How hard is that exactly to understand?  If they use a Warrior, they have a decent chance of being fed an ass sandwich.  If they use a Knight, they don't.  Pretty simple.  And pretty irrefutable.<br />
<br />

<br />
Balls.  What class was the preferred class for trials tank?  If you guess Warrior, you'd be wrong.  Putting back the barriers would just mean that the uber guilds got their private playgrounds back.  This would not help Warriors as a class.   <br />
<br />
It's nice to see that you don't think the class needs to be changed, after all being elemental capable, you're not really dealing with the problem at the most dire level.  So it's pretty easy to be dismissive of those things you're hardly ever impacted by.</div></div><hr />

Dude, I want some of that shit your smoking bro. I am almost to ID5, I have LR5 and I dont see a damn diffrence between how fast my HP drops compared to a paladin buddy of mine who has more HP then I do with only slightly better gear.<br />
<br />
We dont mitigate better then knight's. Sorry friend that is a MYTH that once was true but isnt anymore. Get on the gameplan. Thats what a lot of warriors are pissed about. Knights tank as good as we do, Have almost the same HP equiv (if your not in Time/EP) and have INNATE aggro lock. <br />
<br />
Now , Tell me again... Where this myth is that warriors tank better etc? Because unless im doing evasive all day long then I aint.<br />
<br />
Dont believe the hype. It's time for a change, It's time for Ahnuld to go to Sillicon Valley and show some of SoE's people what a real steroid induced raging barbarian warrior can do. ^-^<br />
<br />
Then after there done getting lesson's maybe our class will be fixed.<br />
<br />
Peace out.<br />
<br />
Your's in War<br />

<br />
Warriors ,in my experience, are easier to heal....IF and big if here they have the proper AA's. They dont suck the cleric dry of mana because they can be CHed and they have a more even curve of damage. I have noticed that Pallys seem to go for the defensive AA's last as compared to most warriors. A pally misses or gets resisted on stuns and they get eaten big time. I saw a warrior in BoT ae taunt three mobs go defensive and let the chanter pick em off one by one. Have yet to see a similar feat done by a pally. <br />
<br />
****disclaimer***** Remember Im not elemental and I do mostly groups NOT raids.  I know Im not uber and have no clue on the high end game. I am just adding my whole &quot;average player&quot; perspective.</div></div><hr />

I am picked up for MA tasks and thats what i want to stand up for, theres allways an assling that will steal agro from me and feel proud of it no matter what i use in my hands.<br />
