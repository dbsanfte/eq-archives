<br />
All I have heard is that it drops in Txevu. Any info on this as to rarity and what not?<br />
<br />
Just interested in knowing how its aggro will compare to a Darkblade / EoE ....(assuming both setups have A3 augs).<br />
<br />
<br />
And as a question, if you had this weapon, would you tank with it or only use it as dps? Seems to me that a weapon cranking out dps like this (35/70) is going to turn alot of mobs.<br />
<br />
The one downside to HoEP would be the loss of 3 AC and 120HP to the Darkblade / EoE combo....<br />
<br />
Oh and by the way, what would the max crit on a 35/70 weapon be? Somewhere near or over 1k right?....i shudder to think of seeing the Crippling Blows ! :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raaj</div><div class="date">07-22-2004, 10:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It drops off the runt event.</div></div><hr />

Fact is that most warriors at this level have 13k+ buffed and riposte are simply not an issue. If they are, then 2h weapons really aren't going to make a difference because they would likely be 1 rounded even without a riposte. I know that I would be pretty unhappy to see a warrior tanking with a 2h weapon on my wizard. There simply isn't enough agro without multiple procs to hold off classes that can crank out upwards of 500dps in an encounter.</div></div><hr />

  <br />
<br />
Agreed...however, this leads back to my original question. Can the dps of a 35/70 weapon combined with a Timesnap Proc amount to the hate produced from a Darkblade / EoE?<br />
<br />
I dual wield 2 A3 Augged wpns (one with EB) with WA5 and Ambidex. And yet I have had aggro issues with a couple toons (BST and Monk) that wield wpns of extremely good dmg/delay ratios (GoD wpns).<br />
<br />
Does anyone have first hand experience with the Aggro produced from a HoEP?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slammer</div><div class="date">07-22-2004, 03:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have seen it in action and let me tell ya, It is great agro (imo)...I hate using 1hs and when the time comes im hopeing a getting a shot at one of these. IMO with Aten Gloves,EOA Gaunts,Anger 3 plus Time spin procs that i will have the same amout of agro if not more then other warriors with 1hs weapons..But who knows only time will tell..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">07-22-2004, 05:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">From a nukers perspective, I can say with certainty that I can nuke harder with a DW warrior than with 2h warrior. While there is no dispute that a high ratio, high DB weapon builds good agro, they are still no competition to having 10ppm+ of agro procs. You might get better intial agro with a big 2h weapon, but as soon as a DW setup starts proc'ing it will catch and pass even the best 2h weapons. I am of course comparing 1h weapons of similar quality. I am sure that this weapon would blow away a BoC+CHSD, but it's no match for a DBotW+JOS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">07-22-2004, 11:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have experimented a bit with Great Maul of the Mighty (59/31) which has better ratio than Halberd (65/35).  My feeling is that it's not going to be even close to Fleshbiter/DBoW + one good offhand unless you want to put an Anger 3 in Halberd, but if you do that you might as well just DW anyway.  <br />
<br />
If you want DPS get Great Maul fo the Mighty instead anyway.  Yeah is has 0 AC, but it also won't get you any aggro so you don't have to worry about tanking.<br />
<br />
However, one would expect Halberd to be pretty good for short fights like yard trash clearing where ratio is more important (no one procs much on a mob that dies in 30 seconds).</div></div><hr />

I'm wondering if it was nerfed specifically to add value to an item yet to be discovered in Tacvi. :p</div></div><hr />

It's not a nerf on an item that was never even attainable.<br />
<br />
Or did all the EP BPs get upgraded because they're better than what was linkmined long before people got into Plane of Time?</div></div><hr />

I can assure you no one was even close to Txevu in Feb 24.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Heh, on my lunch break i ran home and did  BOT Le with a chanter and a beast,my bot cleric and me. I asked the chanter to slow on incoming and loaded up 6 stuns on my cleric and chained them on the mobs to test the agro from timesnap,anger3 and call of fire. After 14 stuns in a row my cleric got summoned and i proced again  which pulled the agro back to me. The proc rate on time snap seems very good.</div></div><hr />

No dude it's really good.  Much better than other weapons with exactly the same procrate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This was when the item was first mined from the drop database.<br />
<br />
Live 06-14 22:26 Changed damage from '70' to '65' <br />
<br />
This was when the item was ACTUALLY dropped, and someone re-added it to Lucy. <br />
<br />
The damage could have been changed in the database at any point between these dates. Lucy takes items from links only, it does not mine information from a file like spdat, and as such items are only updated whenever they are submitted. Its possible that it was ninjachanged right after it was found but before it was re-submitted, but its unlikely.</div></div><hr />

Correcting your misinformation is derailing the thread?  I'm glad your gut likes the sword, but it has a standard procrate.</div></div><hr />

I dont go with every thing i read most of the time, I like do things my way and use my gut on what i want.  As for Wandor and Brutul find some other thread to derail..No derail about it. So far in this thread you has stated:<br />
<br />
1. IMO with Aten Gloves,EOA Gaunts,Anger 3 plus Time spin procs that i will have the same amout of agro if not more then other warriors with 1hs weapons<br />
2. The proc rate on time snap seems very good<br />
3. I like do things my way and use my gut on what i want<br />
<br />
There are a lot of people who come to this board to get information about warrioring because you can usually count on the information to be right. You know why that is? Because this board has a solid base of people who are willing to put in many hours parsing logs and producing tests that back up theories based on parsed results.<br />
<br />
It is nothing short of insulting when someone comes here refuting knowledge that has been gained after literally hundreds of hours of parsing and testing when all they have to go on is a &quot;gut feeling.&quot; Time and again people's gut feelings have been proven wrong.<br />
<br />
As a wise man once said - Parse it or STFU.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rueeliar</div><div class="date">08-12-2004, 11:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Howdy Slammerp.  How've you been?<br />
<br />
Parsed it.  3.25 ppm with WA5 and zero Combat Effects.  Short parse, though, only 90 minutes.  Long enough that proc streaks should be ironed out and not skew the data.  In the hands of a warrior, the aggro will be higher than A3 auged JOS/Demerix combos (our luck with DBoW/FB drops is a joke), but will be inferior to the aggro of any DW combo with a real aggro mainhander (DBoW/FB).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slammer</div><div class="date">08-13-2004, 01:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Been doing good Rueeliar, i have not had a chance to phase so thanks for help there.  Yeah Vs DBow and Jos i  have trouble at times. Just got EOA gloves the other day and its helps some. So with the combo of Time snap ,Aten gloves,anger3, plus Vadds Gaunts i can hang pretty well when called on to TM a mob or tank one.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">08-18-2004, 12:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">BoW was better agro then the best dw setups because the DPS was so good. im not sure the same can be said for this weapon, is the DPS that much more than dbow+jos on top of WA5. i doubt even BoW is better than other elemental/ssra combos after wa5.<br />
<br />
i still dont know how ppl dismiss riposte hits for 3k+ though. even if they arent that common, dont you think that is what normally does you in?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rueeliar</div><div class="date">08-18-2004, 04:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Most guilds have given up on CH chains.  Without chains, the limit of healing that can be poured out on an individual tank has skyrocketed, making it much simpler and easier for a single cleric to recast DI without slack forming.  With an increase in healing power being funneled to the tank, the damage from ripostes is less of an issue, especially with increasing hp making DI more and more reliable.  Max hits in Defensive are increasing in proportion to maximum hit points of warriors, but the window grows narrower without anything to alter the statistical probabilities as AC continues to reduce the frequency of max hits and spikes become more a result of a string of successful hits rather than a string of max hits.  All of those combine essentially to create a situation of reliable healing power.  Mana becomes an issue, after a while, but with healing so strong, tanks can sacrifice the loss of ripostes from a 2hander for the dramatically increased aggro output of dual-wielding, also increasing the DPS of the raid as a whole, resulting in shorter fights, which was the aim of GoD in the first place.<br />
<br />
And I expect a warrior dual-wielding a solid DPS combo will still do more damage than the Halberd, or at least comparable.  Need parses to be certain, though.</div></div><hr />
