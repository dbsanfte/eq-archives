<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cyberfire2k4</div><div class="date">03-02-2005, 08:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I’m a long time reader, but this is only my 2nd post, so I thought I would introduce myself...<br />
<br />
I'm a 45 warrior on the blackhand server (horde, of course).  24 Arms / 11 Fury (up to piercing howl).  I mainly use a nice 2hander, just got Blade of the Titans and I solo about 95% of the time.<br />
<br />
Well, now that that's out of the way...<br />
<br />
I have recently tried to set up a macro to switch to my sword and board to use a shield bash, and then switch right back to my titans.  This failed, failed horribly...  I got it to switch to my 1h/shield setup, but it kept saying I had no shield equipped. <br />
<br />
I have tried to script it a few different ways, and I have tried to use bits of things I have found on different sites, but I have not found a solution to this problem yet.  As of now, I just use a flexbar with my shield in slot 1, shield bash in slot 2, and my titans in slot 3.  I can quickly click each button to throw a stun in when needed, but it is still far from perfect.   (Half the time I end up taking to long and start swinging without a weapon in hand &gt;_&lt;... blah)<br />
<br />
Any help would be much appreciated</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">leekos</div><div class="date">03-02-2005, 09:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have had similar problems.  Mainly, I dual wield, and I want to switch to my 2 hander when I do an overpower etc, then switch back.  After some research, I found out a few things.<br />
<br />
When a macro is run, all of the commands are run at the same time.  There is no way to have one command wait until after another command has finished.  So when you run your macro, the system is trying to perform a shield bash at the same time that it is still swapping weapons.   Then, if you try to include switching back, the system is trying to equip the weapons that you already have equipped at the same time that you are trying to equip the shield.<br />
<br />
If you use cosmos, there is a command for macros to wait so many seconds before performing that command, but this is still very limited.  This command only works with chat text or emotes, and will NOT work with casting, weapon equips, and I think items.<br />
<br />
Somebody please correct me if I'm wrong, but this may be what is screwing with your macro.<br />
<br />
I think the FAQ is at this link:<br />

<br />
(I'm at work right now and the damn web filter won't let me go there to confirm  lol)<br />
<br />
What you may have to do is have a macro to swap weapons:<br />
<br />
/equip weapon_name<br />
/equipoffhand shield_name<br />
<br />
then manually execute shield bash<br />
<br />
then have another macro to switch back to your 2 hander</div></div><hr />

You could use the WeaponSets (http://www.curse-gaming.com/mod.php?addid=111) AddOn, and use it's keybind to cycle through two sets.   It's .toc entry is for an earlier build of the WoW interface, but disabling version checking or editing the file does the trick.  There're a couple other AddOns on Curse gaming (and elsewhere) that are applicable too.</div></div><hr />

He has two excellent scripts that dont need cosmos and enable you to swap weapons by clicking a button, or switch weapon sets automatically when you change stances.<br />
<br />
You might have to change version number in your mods' .toc files to 4216 to make them work.</div></div><hr />
