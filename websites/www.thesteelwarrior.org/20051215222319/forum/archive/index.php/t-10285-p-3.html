<br />
It's &quot;Problems,&quot; like standing around in an auctionhouse during prime time.  Well duh, of course you're gonna have issues in capital cities during prime time. Occasionally the server decides it's being a piece of shit, or the login server goes down, or what have you.  Big deal..it's over in an hour.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Hello Mr. Understatement Of The Year!  I think I was pretty clear in my post that I don't go near AH at prime time.  My woes have nothing at all to do with standing around the AH during prime playing hours.    I think I was also pretty clear in my post that I experience severe lag and latency issues starting around midnight PST, which unless I miss my mark completely aren't even close to prime playing hours.  I doubt I ever play during prime play hours on weekdays because, like certain other assholes in this thread, I happen to have a job that keeps me at work until around 8-9 at night, PST. <br />
<br />
1.  The lag issues are not limited to an hour a night.  People experience them almost constantly throughout the night and week and months.  Sometimes are worse than others.  When the meter jumps to 600 and 700 and stays there for extended periods of time so that I can't fight mobs or heal my group reliably, I get annoyed.  At other times its 400, which is still unacceptable but something I can live with. <br />
<br />
2.  In case #1 isn't crystal clear, lag issues aren't limited to prime playing time. <br />
<br />
3.  We are the lucky ones on Hellscream because we only have small queues sometimes and can still typically play the game through the lag.  Other servers experience more than severe lag during on- and off-times.  They have server outages for days, lag so bad that even Blizzard admits its completely unplayable, and large login queues. <br />
<br />
In the end, there is no need to play understatement or downplay the problems unless you are purely being a fanboi.  There ARE problems.  And they should be fixed.  Recognizing that they should be fixed doesn't make me some slobbering idiot who must get her fix; it means I have eyes.  If you need to play the rhetoric game and be derogative about players in order to protect your new favorite obsession, go for it.  Doesn't change the facts here.  Are we asking people to freak out and go on strike?  Hell, no.  But in your zealous defense, you don't seem to get that.  I recognized when EQ had problems and I supported you (and others) who stated them.  I'll be damned if I'll do any less with a new gaming company.  I'll continue to do the same thing with WoW and we will hopefully ensure that Blizzard maintains a high standard in performance and customer service.  Downplaying this shit and allowing them to shovel the server instability shit into your mouth (even worse, trying to feed us the same shit by suggesting that we should also allow them to shovel it into our mouths) doesn't do anything but add to the problem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On Hellscream, which I don't consider particularly overpopulated relatively speaking, there have been short queues on most weekend evenings and some weeknights (obviously in particular Fridays but I've seen queues on other evenings as well, keeping in mind that I never get in front of my computer on weeknights before 8ish).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I seriously have no fucking clue what you're talking about.  I'm on that server every hour except prime time most days, and I rarely have any issues.<br />
<br />
Queues?  Every time I get one, I go take a piss and hit the fridge.  I'm on character select every time I get back.<br />
<br />
Any time I've ever experienced any lag, it's over in a matter of a few minutes.  It's none of this &quot;All nite long&quot; bullshit you wanna try to pass off.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, for people like Red who just don't fucking get it...this is what I've been saying for YEARS.  Server is down for awhile?  We should probably be reimbursed for our time.  The response to me thru that time?  &quot;Oh, you're just never happy with anything Haass, you'll bitch just to bitch.&quot;<br />
<br />
No, clearly that's not fucking true.  They reimburse me for days when my playtime gets fucked over, then that's fine with me.  Look, the fucking game has been out 2 goddamned months, and they've already given us 5 days.  You REALLY think that this is the solution that they want?  Extrapolate that..that's a free month after the rest of this year.  14.99 times 400,000 customers.  You REALLY think that they're not doing everything they can to get this shit under control?  Gee, I dunno, 6 million dollars seems like an awful big fucking motivating factor to me.  But clearly, they're just ignoring the problems and hoping everything works itself out right?  Dumbasses.<br />
<br />
If I'm a fanboy, then all you bitches have been rabid SoE fanboys for so long that you can't appreciate decent service apparantly.  Maybe EQ2 is for you.</div></div><hr />

Now, with WoW, they can do no wrong.  Yes, you are a complete fanboy, and one of the worst kinds.  Your dad should have smacked you upside the ass a few times when you where growing up so you would not act like such a spoiled rotten little kid.  'OMG, my game is better than your game, they can do no wrong, you are idiots not to see it'.  What a fucking idiot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've seen the blizz staff refund time, and I've gotten good help from their GM staff, on top of that I have only seen sony say sorry to its players twice, even when they were dicking them around between expantions, blizzard has asked to be forgiven each time they are down longer than normal and has said sorry for the stability problems.<br />
<br />
With bliz being the game's caretaker I feel like I am a VIP instead of a pawn.<br />
<br />
Redhenna, take a look at the customer follow up each company has had to downtime, yeah it sucks when it happens but at least I do not have to pay for their servers melting down, or a intern pulling out the power cord when he trips.<br />
<br />
I know what I say doesn't mean much because of the whole models thing, once being on the list of things to give us, but why don't you talk to woody over at GU, he just this month made a comic about it and brought this topic up... so I am not 100% nuts... some of you may even remember the bad run/walk animations as a first attempt at this, but anyway what I say on this subject is true, sony is dick when it comes to CS so the hell with anyone that gives me shit for supporting WoW instead of EQ, I know good CS when I see it</div></div><hr />

<br />
Downtime and server problems are part of CS, considering how much larger the launch was (and the lack of hard zone lines) this game is doing damn good, it just grew a hell of alot faster than fedex could deliver their new servers and overhead.<br />
<br />
What he is saying is that the CS is better than what he experianced in everquest, which is fact... so he is a fanboy for speaking the truth?<br />
<br />
*shakes head* I guess I really don't get it.</div></div><hr />

Wow thread to the eq rant board, what's wrong with you people.<br />
<br />
I think sHORTY should create an Outhouse subsection for the WoW forum, cause it won't stop so easily. Actually, seing all the threads on talent builds, instances, quests &amp; zones, flaming/ranting threads I think WoW is gonna need the same subforums as EQ has.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raaj</div><div class="date">01-20-2005, 04:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The reason I hadn't expanded the forum lists for WoW is because the number of posts were small enough that it didn't seem very useful to split them up, but I'll throw some sub forums up. The names of the forums as well as the topics will be checked once I wake up, it's too early to think at the moment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">01-20-2005, 07:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Haass, every time something happened in EQ yuou did not like, you threw a hissy fit, whined, bitched and moaned about how terrible SoE was <br />
<br />
Fact : Whenever something happened in EQ that I didn't like, I offered a better way that they could go about it.  IE : Extended server downtime?  Give us a credit on our account for it.  I'm paying for time I can't play.<br />
<br />
Fact : Whenever I said the above, I was IMMEDIATELY met with &quot;OMG, you want a credit for 15 cents? LOLZOR GET A FUCKING GRIP.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fact : Right now, I am being credited for time I am unable to play the game.  I'm also currently VERY fucking happy with that situation because it is the compensation I asked for, and it also hurts their bottom line too..which it fucking should.  You don't get very far in the business world giving your stuff away for free, that's why I feel it's an acceptable compromise.  I know I'm not being shafted, and I know that it hurts them right in the pocketbook.<br />
<br />
Blizzard can do no wrong?  Hardly.  I think they've made a couple of assinine decisions.  First on the list was labeling the servers by timezone on release, followed shortly by deciding to &quot;Stagger&quot; the times they were bringing servers online on release day to meet the need.  Both total dipshit moves that anyone with any foresight at all could see would lead us right where we are today.<br />
<br />
My comments had zero to do with that. It had everything to do with some one who acted like a poiled 12 year old every time something he did not like happened in EQ, but whos only response to anyone complaining about WoW is to insult the person making the complain. <br />
<br />
Shut the fuck up.  Do you have any idea the amount of &quot;insulting&quot; I endured while making complaints about EQ?  Do you have any idea how many spoiled 12 year olds tried to tell me that SoE was doing &quot;everything possible&quot; to ensure our gaming satisfaction?  Do you have any idea HOW FUCKING WRONG EVERY ONE OF THEM WAS?<br />
<br />
Bottom line..I bitched about things because I wanted SoE to make EQ the game that it COULD have been if they had paid a little more attention to detail.  They didn't.  I didn't fucking play EQ because I'm some kind of masochist.  I played it because it very well could have been the best game ever, with zero competition from anyone.  Sony decided they didn't want that, and were only after the quick buck.  So far, Blizzard is doing a much better job of it than I ever saw from Sony.  Are they doing a perfect job?  Hardly.  Could they do better?  Of course.   But from where I stand, given the choices in the market, I'll gladly take a couple of days of credit on my account over some jackass like Smedly posting somewhere saying &quot;Oh ya...we're real sorry about that.  Uhh, we'll look into it.  Or something.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikken</div><div class="date">01-20-2005, 08:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not sure about the lag thing. I can play all hours of the day and not experience any noteworthy lag. I do know that what many people label lag is actually bad framerate. With all the character moving around in the AH during peak hours, you are going to need a bad ass system to display it smoothly. Thats on every online game when lots of unique avatars are taking up memory space, slowing down your framerate.<br />
<br />
You will not be able to move under those circumstances. However, if you are experiencing the real lag, data tranfer delays, you can move all you want to around in the gameworld. Just like in EQ, if you unplug your internet connection while running across a zone, you will continue to run. The client is still going to try and send posistion updates to the server, because it doesn't wait for a server response.<br />
<br />
If you can't move, you're having performance issues with your client, not lag. Lag is fighting a mob and having it warp or run across the screen to catch up with its position updates from the server, looting a corpse and having to wait for the item to be moved to your inventory, or having a fight stop responding mid battle with no damage updates.<br />
<br />
If you want baby smooth and consistant framerates in an online game. You are dreaming. If designers keep making games with a set amount of memory that they are going to use for textures, optimize performance and system requirments around an average value of avatars to be rendered, and then give each avatar unique and varied textures, and then let all those player congragate in the same area, you are going to have performance issues. Its why upgrading your video card improved eq more than upgrading your connection. Just like it is in AO, DAoC, SWG, Horizons, Second Life,...etc. If your having these types of performance issues, you do what you can, but otherwise you are outta luck.<br />
<br />
Personally, I have very little issues with only 1GB ram, ati 9800, and 1.2Ghz. I consider that a bare minimum now days for a new premium game. If you want to whine about performance go ahead, but saying that they should do something about it is another thing. My systems specs are barely above recommended specs, and I have little to no issues with the game.<br />
<br />
I played on hellscream for a while, to see how bad it is, and it WAS bad. However since the upgrades, I haven't had any problems outta all the times I've been playing an alt on that server while my main one was down. Which was a huge improvement for that server. I hate that things didn't go so well for my server, but I'm confident that blizz will deliver, and refund when they don't. Fanboi or not, this game has the best customer service I've even seen on an online game. I've had a few tickets for various issues, mostly player disruption, and they were handle by the GM staff within an hour. I've played a hell of a lot of online games, nearly every major one on the market, but never have I had such responsive support.</div></div><hr />
