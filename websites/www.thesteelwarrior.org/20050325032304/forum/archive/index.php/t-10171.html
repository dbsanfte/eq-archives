Monster DPS in MPG is very spikey.  I can tank there, but some of the harder camps are difficult (my magelo is on the left).  Defnintely, you will need a good cleric and a slower.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">01-03-2005, 06:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I find MPG worse than Riftseeker because you can get the Lightning/Zun guys who have extremely good MR so it's not unusual to see one unslowed, whereas Pyrilens/Gelidrans might hit a bit higher but at least they don't have super resists.<br />
<br />
Also flurry on the lightning guys suck too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spikela</div><div class="date">01-03-2005, 06:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye -- you can do it with a good shammy, cleric, and puller... but it'll be rough and you'll be crying by the time your done from twitching spastically. On the other hand. It's FUN!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Swing</div><div class="date">01-08-2005, 01:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">65 Warrior here with 7107 hp and 1476ac unbuffed. I was coaxed into going to MpG and tanking there ( didn't want too, but peeps wouldn't take no for an answer.) Anyways i was able to effectively tank the mobs at the entrance. It was murder on the cleric tho, he had to chain CH alot of the time with my tribute going and also using defense disc. When i say effectively tank i mean no one died, not that it was an easy tanking adventure. Anyways if i could tank there, i bet you could too, may be a lil rough on cleric but you could get it done. Me - well imma wait awhile till i go back there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frostpaw</div><div class="date">01-08-2005, 03:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">if you 9k with just conviction then with Wunshi/Brells/misc you right around 10k, which makes it doable for sure. Try someplace like Blind/Task with no lightning guys and i bet you be just fine.<br />
<br />
Wanted to add this also; make sure that everyone in the group understands the situation and how to make it work.  Make sure cleric isn't trying to start a CH when mob already on you and hope to land it. The healer is gonna have to start CH on inc and/or use fast heals whether they like it or not (some clerics will complain because their fast heals aren't as mana efficient as CH).  If you have a bard pulling, bringing em in pre-slowed can be a big help.  Some of these guys need to be debuffed before slows work. Make sure people are on it pronto. Any class that can heal can throw a small heal or two on you while the mob is being debuffed/slowed or if it looks like cleric heal wont land in time.  I guess what im sayin is that you have what it takes to tank there as far as HP/AA/gear as long as rest of group is smart too. Get everyone else in the group doing all they can to make it work and you should have a good time there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drunder50</div><div class="date">01-08-2005, 08:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">All i can say is at lvl 69 with 9200ish HP's and 1570ish AC with all defensive aa's up to and including PoP, I got tore up by the trash mobs at the tactics camp and the Taskfiend Caikap camp. WoS zone in area seemed a bit easier. <br />
<br />
Cleric did her best but the DPS spikes these mobs have is insane especially the Proc'ers. Even when mob was slowed, I was sweating alot. We got a lvl 70,  11.5K HP/1650ish AC Warrior to tank and wow what a difference. Got almost 40% regular exp  in a third the time it would have taken in WoS. 4% aa a kill also (Had to see was curious).  <br />
<br />
I am pissed cause i get tells all the time to join a MPG group and tank but i'm gonna have to get Sturdiness 5 and more Defensive aa's b 4 i can tank reliably in that zone.  Very challenging zone.  Again, The mob DPS there is insane.  <br />
Once i get 50% into lvl 70 i'm back to aa's and cant wait :-). <br />
<br />
I will have my due in MPG just gonna have to be patient.. After seeing the stats on the Matchless Silvery Claymore, my desire to get into the trials has increased quite a bit. That 2hander is SWEET. /sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kleth</div><div class="date">01-08-2005, 09:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">MSC comes from MPG raid trials, not group ones. Rime Encrusted Pikestaff does tho froM efficiency.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Detheb Ultimaweapon</div><div class="date">01-09-2005, 01:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh, like they said. Spike Damage will be the largest problem, even with me.<br />
<br />
I sit at 13.4/13.5 buffed with 2300+ac, and 10 shielding. I still get tore up if the mobs are unslowed. Cleric starts CH on me at 60% though because she doesn't like CH less than 8k =(.<br />
<br />
But, Proccers, and Diodotes are probably the most dangerous mobs in the zone no doubt. If you have a sturdy cleric, who doesn't complain alot, then, Im sure you could do BH/TF/ODI camp..<br />
<br />
<br />
On a side note. RSS is more difficult than MPG by a tad margin, but, with 10k you should be able to do it, with good resist.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Subq</div><div class="date">01-26-2005, 07:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm 9.2k hp 1833 ac with conviction  only and my aa's need serious work, but i dont have any problems in mpg really anymore. As long as you cleric is paying attention you are fine. One thing i have heard is the further back towards RS zl you go, the harder the mobs become. I like to stay around blind camp the enough names to keep the camp interesting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cloudwalker21</div><div class="date">01-26-2005, 09:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you do go, make sure to have a cleric with a large mana pool. Its really rough when you dont have a very high ac count. I'd suggest staying away from it for the time being, simply because even when I buff to 12.5k/1950 ac or so (depending on buffs) mobs can (and have!) ripped me apart simply because of a bad spike of dps. Granted its possible, but it'll be a rough ride.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">01-26-2005, 11:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I went with a guild group, our clerc had a nearly 7k mana pool, none of us were elemental geared (VT at best). I had 10.5k hp and 1860ac for most of the time and found it pretty easy to tank (was doing the Odi/blind hunter area by RSS). The only mobs that proved a challenge were the nocs as they tended to proc chaos claws more than others. I was fighting one and it did over 4k dmg to me in 1 round, I was at 30% health and died just as ch was about to land so they can get lucky rounds in sometimes. Luckily we had a pally in the group for backup and he tanked it while I got rezzed.</div></div><hr />
