<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mahhj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Somewhat new to raiding, just starting to get into the thick of things with my guild, I can tell some of them are new as well.<br />
<br />
I try to do my job pretty well, engaging when called and not drawing aggro as best I can while doin the most damage I can. Raiding for a rogue isn't too different then exping.<br />
<br />
My question is, when a mob gets loose on the casters, or an add aggros on a healer, should I be pole vaulting to peel it off?<br />
<br />
Or is that the job of the paladins and shadowknights who aren't the main ones tanking (usually) anyhow? <br />
<br />
I realize the warrior who is tanking the current monster isn't in a position to just jaunt on over and try and grab the mob off someone, so whose job is it? <br />
<br />
Should anyone with more hp/ac be trying to get it off someone with less? Or is my job to help the warrior finish off the current mob as fast as possible so the new one can be confronted?<br />
<br />
Thanks folks, any suggestions would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Very situational, ideally as a rogue your DPS would be much more greatly missed than a plate tanks when burning down the mob, but if no-one else is quick enough on the uptake and a critical heal (for example) gets stopped or a chanter can't mez then you intervention might be crucial - at the end of the day death reduces your effectiveness less than a spellcaster (you don't need to med) so from a cold blooded perspective your death is 'better' than theirs... Really though, if none of your plate tanks catch on quick enough to respond they're failing in their duties...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">if the caster is really low on health i doubt you could get aggro. if you know the mobs gonna hit hard and kill him quick try to get aggro and take some hits. your no tank but better then a ench or cleric taking hits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Timmok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah stay on main target imo. A number of classes are better suited to deal with adds than rogues, such as Paladins, SKs, Bards and of course Enchanters. <br />
<br />
Non-mezzables are better left for the warriors or hybrids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Some things to think about in that situation:<br />
<br />
1: Communication.  If you see an add on a caster, call it.  Tanks tend to have their face burried in a mob, and may not see it at first.  If they know as add is in camp, and where it is at, they should get it under control fast(hopefully).<br />
<br />
2: Is the mob mezzable?  If yes, then as a rogue you are almost the last choice to peal agro off.  You have no agro tools outside melee damage, which will break the hopefully incoming mez.  This is why pallies excell at this role, being able to peal a mob off a caster with no damage stuns, ensuring that mez will land.<br />
<br />
3:  If you have communicated that it is there, and mob is not mezzable, and no tank is jumping on it, then most likely it is best to jump on it, at least to buy time.<br />
<br />
If it is just the mob the raid force is killing that some caster overagroes, then yes, grab agro fast if you can, then let tank taunt back of you.<br />
<br />
Your best bet is to talk to your raid leader, and find out what he expects from you in those situations.  Most raid leaders welcome questions of that type, especially if asked at a convienient time(that is, not im middle of a raid when he is buried in details).</div></div><hr />
