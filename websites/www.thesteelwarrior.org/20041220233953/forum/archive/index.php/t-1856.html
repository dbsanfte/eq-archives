<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NinjaBurger</div><div class="date">07-09-2003, 06:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have thought about this for awhile, and now I'm certain; Planes of Power is Satan Incarnate. So far, all the Planes have caused for me is the retirement of two characters that I truly loved playing pre-PoP, and having to put up with &quot;Uber Guilds&quot; in order to get my money's worth of the game. <br />
           I know what you're thinking, &quot;But NinjaBurger, you can travel everywhere in the world with ease, AND get all your shopping done! Plus, get all the spells!&quot;  Blah, blah, blah. I personally think that the knowledge books took the fun out of the game of traveling everywhere. It just seems to me that shopping for things I need is trivial, and it really shouldn't be for a GAME. To me, these are actually the only redeeming things in Planes of Power.<br />
<br />
-Zones<br />
<br />
C'mon, everyone knows that PoP zones have insane experience, and EVERYONE wants in on it. That's the problem. PoP experience IS too good; no one wants to go anywhere else. Why go to Chardok and get an AA every 3 hours when you can get one every 30 minutes? Plus, there's the problem that they've unlocked most Planes zones, and now it's just a freaking mess around BoT and HoT.<br />
<br />
-Changes<br />
<br />
This is what made me angry. Now that mobs hit HARD and ripostre hard, you have no choice but fast aggro, thus making knights the best tanks. Now most warriors will sit for hours on end at the zone line, waiting for a chance to level. This frustrated me to no end, and what made me, Baron Roreksis Koopatroopa, 54 Iksar Champion, retire my warrior. I'm just sick of sitting on my ass for hours on end waiting for someone to feel sorry for me and get me a group. It just seems to me now that if you don't have a spellbook, you're a gimp. Same goes for monks, who used to be great pullers. Guess what? You're a gimp if you're a monk too. For the love of god, BARDS pull better now. So what we have left is just &quot;Ok DPS&quot; [Sheenadonas Saotome-50 monk(Retired)]<br />
<br />
-Raiding material<br />
<br />
This, this my friends sucks. I have not had large amounts of experience raiding in upper tiers, but with all the poor itemizing, I'd imagine that most classes are gimped still.<br />
<br />
So...there's my writeup. The elegy of the warrior/monk who didn't feel useful anymore after Planes of Power. Quite the shame, don't you think?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Did you notice that FoH is now recruiting heavily?  Apparently they are down to raiding with 30 real folks and a dozen botted toons.  What is this game coming to?<br />
<br />
/sigh<br />
<br />
You gonna stay on in another form?  Druid or Necro maybe?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Who'd have ever thunk it?  Druids wanted in a Raid Group (Ok, maybe not wanted, but allowed) and Warriors just not quite worth it anymore.  <br />
<br />
I'll continue to play my little warrior.  I'm pre-PoP anyways.  And I casual so much, I don't think I'll ever find a guild willing to take me on.</div></div><hr />

Opening up the zones to everyone just made things worse.  Hopefully the new revamped zones and Lost Dungeons expansion will breath some new life.</div></div><hr />

Think about it a little before pulling a smart ass responce off. Warrior's don't solo all that great and everyone is in PoP so its pretty damn hard to find a old world group no matter what class you are. Getting friends together is great and a good friend will help you out if you need it, but most people I know just want to be in PoP they don't want to go back an spend time in the old world without a visable goal. Come down to the guild bit.... nothing stops anyone from joining a guild,, there are tons out there who are easy to join, but they all are pretty crappy. The general idea of a guild is you have one leader or a couple leaders and they tell everyone else what to do, and all those other people work together to get those orders followed through. Is it a crime to want to be able to enjoy this game without being in a guild? Nothing has STOPPED him dead, but it is kinda hard, play your game, but don't use the superiority stick on other people.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">07-10-2003, 10:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">PoP was actually the best thing that happened to me. It was the last nail in teh coffin to ending my excessive playtime.<br />
<br />
I still sometimes see my old guildmates; go on a raid or two if I happen to see them and they have a spot...and when it's all said and done if there's no groups to be found I log off and go join the real world.<br />
<br />
Been quite fun actually. On the whole port_stone thing; it sure beats sittng waiting for people to collect your coin just to cast a spell to send ya somewhere. I can almost cover every zone in norrath in 30 minutes; which was about the time it took to find someone to either port ya or run your sorry ass to where you want to go.<br />
<br />
PoP was good to me. Can't f**k around with reality when it's staring ya in the face. Shikarii still floats around Terris and usually is found sitting somewhere making arrows or ... fishing. Little Kiadan can be seen too just running around aimlessly as well. There's no more desire for me to chase carrots. I'll just sit here on the farm and watch the s**t grow in my rocking chair from now on. And it's been great ever since.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khazzuz</div><div class="date">07-10-2003, 04:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I only end up playing my warrior once a week or so anymore.  I bring him out for raids or just an occasional group.  The thing that really makes me not want to play him anymore isn't so much the LFG thing, its the complete and utter sense of futility and embarrassment I get while trying to do my job.  If a pally joins the group and they insist he tanks I almost breathe a sigh of relief at the end of my personal humiliation.  For people who have worked so hard to get where they are, and we all know acquiring all the equipment for a warrior is hard work, nothing is more shameful than being unable to perform your job, meanwhile group members that don't know you are looking out of the corner of their eyes saying to themselves 'man, he sucks.'<br />
<br />
On the bright side of life, like shik said, at least I have a clean house now, clean clothes, and bother to cook myself a nice meal every night =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pidany</div><div class="date">07-10-2003, 04:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know I am new to the boards, but have just recently started playing my warrior again.<br />
I too am having PoP issues. I lack the taunt to keep aggro and get told that many times while grouping.<br />
I started a cleric in my off time that I couldn't find groups. Of course my cleric has leveled to 65 and here I sit after 13 months at 56. I thought with the addition of PoP that I would have an easier time, if only in the old zones. No go.<br />
I do an LFG in PoI, PoN and PoD only to be met with sarcastic remarks. I get to play secondary tank to Pally's and SK's occasionally but have also thought about putting my warrior away again and check back with the new expansion to see if things will improve for her.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaldanm</div><div class="date">07-11-2003, 05:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In fact some times I think we warriors suck... <br />
Then I log in, and I see, beside a little aggro problem when grouped in pickup, I'm ok. We warriors are clearly a raid oriented class, or a class who shine grouped with experienced friends (who know basic rules of aggro). don't despair and be proud of it :).<br />
<br />
here is the post (http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showMessage?topicID=1973.topic), on the old forums, you need to read. Khur said it all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">faederya</div><div class="date">07-11-2003, 11:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">play secondary tank to Pally's and SK's  <br />
<br />
Just wanted to add my 2cp.  I love Knights and BST in my group.  I off play an enchanter and mez can be a killer sometimes and I love having two mobs always in camp.  But with a Knight or BST I can keep three mobs in camp.  One mezzed, one about to die, and then I'll run and grab another while the Knight  or BST grabs agro off the mezzed mob.   With a Knight or BST my AA exp per hour seems to increase two fold.  I believe that if you keep one mob in camp for warrior vs Knight agro then your potential is not being fully met.  I almost always use split tanks when grouped with a Knight or BST in an exp group or dungeon crawl, though my chanter gets bored sometimes, its seems safer then the awful resist rates of mez.<br />
<br />
I'm just rambling ... but I love Knights in my group and I never feel like a secondary tank because I &quot;make&quot; them the secondary tank by using off tanking and multiple pulls. . . Think outside the box</div></div><hr />
