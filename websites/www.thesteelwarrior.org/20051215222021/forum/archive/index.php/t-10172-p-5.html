<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Isk</div><div class="date">01-11-2005, 08:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can do SM in the mid 30s; just start with the rightmost instance and work your way left as you level. There's good drops for most classes. Doan drops a nice dagger/staff for casters, Herod drops a nice helm/shoulder for tanks as well as a 37 DPS 2h axe, Mograine drops a 1500 armor shield (in fact it's his most common drop by far) and a 39 DPS 2h mace, and Whitemane drops a very nice hat for casters/priests, a 30 DPS +healing mace, and an excellent amulet for casters, priests, and paladins.<br />
<br />
Pretty much everyone who's eligible should do In the Name of the Light. The prereqs are nothing, just a little running around to areas you should get gryph points to anyway. Last night in the final SM instance at 42 I was getting 110-160 exp per mob in a full group. When I solo in my chosen spot I get 200 exp per mob and obviously kill more slowly. Just make sure you kill Loksey in the library - a lot of people miss him. He's in the right wing as you enter the first courtyard, accompanied by three dogs.<br />
<br />
Also an NPC in the Ironforge Explorer's League offers Mythology of the Titans - find a book in the SM library instance and you get a 6 sta/spr necklace and some exp, not bad at all. The book isn't out of the way, it's in the bottom left corner of a room you enter.<br />
<br />
Additionally, when you do the final instance, don't forget the &quot;secret&quot; boss, an undead priest who drops several good green items. Once you get to the final cathedral with Mograine, check the room to the right of him, specifically a torch in the wall. If you can kill Mograine, you can kill Fairbanks easily.</div></div><hr />

Its worth doing the quest for that weapon alone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daeos</div><div class="date">01-11-2005, 09:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, I did wind up doing &quot;Into the Scarlet Monastary&quot;, friend was farming SM for cash though or I might have skipped it. As for the Desolace one, I must've missed that, I'll have to look it up, although it's probably not worth it for me to do it this late.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ugle Smashur</div><div class="date">01-11-2005, 09:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, sure, now he says it was fun.  I believe your words during and after said event was something more along the lines &quot;DON'T FUCKING TOUCH SHIT UNLESS WE ARE ALL READY GOD DAMN IT&quot;.  Orders I promptly ignored; must touch shiney things.<br />
<br />
<br />
Bwahahahaaa, I can so see this...and identify.  :D<br />
<br />
<br />
BTW, thank you for all the info on Desolace.  I was there last night for a bit bunch of skinning (  :D  ) and such.  I think Ill do Into the Light and head to SV or back to Alterac.  Im getting bored with Desolace already.  I wasnt too impressed.  Made 35 though hehehe.<br />

/salute</div></div><hr />

I figured there was a good reason I missed it, I always look up all the horde quests before we do an instance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Awesome, well I already have that one and I guess that means I can leave Desolace far far behind.  Though, I might wait until the skins grey out for me.  Most everything is green I can kill.  Skill at 256 I believe.  <br />
<br />
Need to get into a SM run now.  Doan gimmee mah Daggah!   :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bleh, we've killed him a number of times at this point and have yet to get the shield, which would be a significant upgrade for our tank so is the reason we keep trying - got the mace once.  The rest have been scarlet legs, mostly, and maybe a breastplace or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Isk</div><div class="date">01-11-2005, 01:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yux. <br />
<br />
I've killed Mograine but three times and seen the shield twice. According to thottbot the shield drop rate is 37%. Not a terrible place to pharm but I sympathize with the monotony.</div></div><hr />

I picked up the dagger off Doan..not sure how much I like it.<br />
<br />
Clearly caster stats, and just marginally better than the Heavy Mithril Axe, so I'm still toying around with it.  I think it will end up being relegated to offhand for DW purposes (IE : fuckin rarely)</div></div><hr />

Hehee...<br />
<br />
Im addicted to dagers on my Shaman now.  I love the speed w/ Windfury.  I have a Dagger a 1H axe I use.  I refuse to waste a talent point to be able to use 2H weapons.  Besides I enjoy the huge chunk of armor I get from a shield.  Stats in sig.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I just hit 47 with my warrior, and got dead tired of constant questing. Kind of bored with, &quot;Go to this place...kill this thing, take a tooth here, then answer this question.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sometimes good ol'fashion killing is fun!</div></div><hr />

Couldnt have said it better myself.  Absolutely.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thott says it's a 10% drop rate, but everyone is calling bullshit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darmok</div><div class="date">01-13-2005, 04:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've never gotten a Ravager Drop, we got the Shoulder three times, and a group of non shield-users got the shield when I wasn't there!<br />
<br />
I remember us getting to Herod when I was in my high-30s, of course my group said...&quot;Darmok, go tank.&quot;<br />
<br />
I'll never forget...<br />
<br />
&quot;Blades of light!&quot; screamed Herod as he sliced this poor Orc down.<br />
