Thanks guys!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zynth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">ok, nothing personal, that's a bad pull plan, with his AE and everyone moving around your just complicating the situation. placement is bad too, some one opens that door all your casters are gone. you may think it wont happen, but i've been on HoT farming runs where, i kid you not, a wizard pet opened the door. also, pulling a mob that requires a CH chain past the casters isn't very smart. <br />
clear the pit and wanderers, then have everyone moving in (respawn is 72 mins, plenty of time), have the casters move to the corner next to doze's door at the bottom of the steps with the healers lined up on the wall, have the melees oppisite them. when ready, have the MT charge in and pull doze to the corner next to the door while staying inside his room, no reason for doze to leave his room, nothing wanders through there. the ST moves in with the debuffers, ST attacks from behind to provided counter push, debuff chain runs in, casts and runs out. once assist is called the melees move in and push doze into the corner (shrunken MT is important). <br />
now this is where you can tell how much control your guild has. have another person, probably 2 people to be safe, calling AEs. the casters then have 10 seconds after the AE to run into the room, cast their nuke and run back out the door. my AE message is something like, &quot;AE has fired! Casters have 10 seconds to nuke and hide!!! GO GO GO&quot; this button will be useful for aary as well. now, make sure all the melees know to leave the room if they go under 50% health and call for a spot heal. back when my guild did tov we used hot keys for spot heals, something like &quot;/say Spot heal &lt;char's name&gt;&quot; usually we had a cleric or a druid or 2 for the spot heals. after doze is dead, everyone moves into his room (no wanderers and nothing will pop), do loots and move on to kill the mini names for symboles.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tiejinnie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Agree. That's a bad placement for Doz. <br />
<br />
You can't position Doze the way you position the 2 static wurms. It won't work. <br />
<br />
Looking at your map, you see the 2 stairs going down from the entrance? In between the stairs there is this empty square. There's where we used to place Dozekar, facing in. At the top of this quadrangle is the North tunnels. At the doorway is where we place our clerics and utility classes. At just around the corner you can evade his AE.<br />
<br />
Also make sure that they all have Extended Range 3 (Supple Scale Armband has this if I remember correctly). This ensures your CH can reach the MT even if he is pushed to the far corner of the small square. After the wizzies pull off their DD, they can hide around the doorway corner again.<br />
<br />
This requires you to pull the Northen tunnel to clear about 2 more drakes before setting up for Doz.<br />
<br />
G'luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah the best way to do doze is to have the MT and ST rush into the room where doze is and pull him to the immediate left corner right after you go in the door.  The clerics and other healers should stay outside the door and CH the MT through the wall<br />
<br />
Make sure that you have the debuffers rush in also right away to the corner with the tanks, its important that you get doz slow right away and you need to be in melee range to cast on him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Barja Bardagi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks guys, I'll re-draw my diagrams and repost.  I have done Dozer twice (failed both, but not for bad tactic) with single-groups... I was using Single-Group tactic when I drew these up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>richardkent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Barja,<br />

Just thought I'd drop a line and say that I've done Dozekar in the exact corner that you've shown.  I fought in HoT for 3 weeks straight, pulling dragons into that exact corner (opposite one as well) and placing casters behind the wall in the middle of the room as well as near the door entering HoT.<br />
<br />
When we did Doze it was with 2 groups of max ally CoV folks.  We pinned him into the corner you show, with the fire pot and pounded it out for 30ish minutes.<br />
<br />
If you have KOS folks, then that's a different story all together.  We had:<br />
<br />
65 necromancer<br />
65 warrrior x 2<br />
65 enchanter<br />
65 mage x 2<br />
65 shaman<br />
65 druid x 2<br />
65 cleric x 2<br />
65 wizard<br />
<br />
Necro/mages chained pets.  Wizard did not have familiar up.  I have never had mobs rush in on me while fighting at the fire pots near the door in the 30+ times I've done HoT, but I don't do stupid stuff, perhaps thats the difference :)<br />
<br />
The benefit of fighting Dozekar up near the door area, is if you wipe CR is 2 seconds.  If you fight Dozekar near his spawn, then you need to worry about the 2 guardians and 2 roamers that will be coming by that area.   This becomes critical if you fail your first try as you may run into their respawn (~60 minutes).  A single guardian popping on you means all your casters eat his aoe or they move into doze's room and eat his, not the greatest.  Plus, CR is now a pain in the arse...   just my 2cp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>jaxxym</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Coupla thoughts Barja...<br />
<br />
First is - make sure as many of yer peeps as possible have an insta click item *equipped* and are clicking it throughout the fight. I can't stress this enough for the MT and other melees, but it's also very useful for casters/support crew.<br />
<br />
Next, have plenty of RC/purify soul capability on hand to cure mana dot on casters.<br />
<br />
Next, make SURE that the chanters/shammies get into melee range to slow/reslow. Sticks much easier this way and you can always battle-rezz - this is a long fight, and if slow wears off yer in trouble.<br />
<br />
Use the hide/pop out/hide again scheme with your casters - they need to time the AoE as much as possible so they know when to pop out and when to hide. With that many ppl whacking Doze, he'll be getting pushed around a LOT so yer casters may need to adjust their positions throughout to compensate.<br />
<br />
Assuming nobody screws up the above, the real key will be to keep your MT alive until Doze is slowed. The cleric mana expenditure will go way down once he's slowed so have them pour it on to keep MT alive at the outset. <br />
<br />
We had about 16 or 17 peeps, avg level 64, and it was easy - once he'd been slowed - here are the stats from that battle:<br />
<br />
Defeated: Dozekar the Cursed (300702 hp)<br />
Melee damage dealt = 108862 (420.3 * 259 of 439) &lt;69.9%&gt; [0.25 hits/s, 103 dps]<br />
Before slow: 372.27 dps, 0.99 hits/s (Slowed in 27.3 seconds)<br />
After slow:  95.9 dps, 0.23 hits/s<br />
Max hit = 900 (9), Min hit = 217 (16), DI = 35.9, DB = 181.1, DI/DB = 0.2<br />
Fight duration: 00:17:40</div></div><hr />
