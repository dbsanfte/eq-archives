I recently received a BoC and I am not holding aggro as well.  I am actually using it off hand, with the CHSD in my main to hold aggro.  <br />

I have two questions:<br />

(1) Has anyone else has experienced this?<br />

(2) Will it change when I Anger aug the BoC, or should I put the next aug onto the CHSD and continue using it in my main?<br />

Thank you, Waza.  I have read your posts for a long time and respect your opinion... I will follow your advice.  :)</div></div><hr />

BoC=15/20 700 hate<br />
CHSD= 13/19 450 hate</div></div><hr />

a boc with anger3 is 4 procs per minute 2 eb, 2 anger 2600 agro<br />

dbotw probably generates around 1100 agro per proc with 30% incresases proc rate, plus a shit load more dps.</div></div><hr />

Don't agree.  SoD is some damned fine aggro, and better DPS to boot.  I sold my BoC because it wasn't worth using in lieu of SoD/Copper Hammer combo.<br />
<br />
BoC is nice, sure, but don't put it on a pedastal like that.  It's not THAT much better to many options today.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Celeritum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Just out of curiosity, why did you get rid of the BoC and keep the SoD/CHOS?  If you had kept the SoD and BoC and mainhanded the BoC, isn't that great aggro right there?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Omnus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">the comparison was AUG'd boc vs un-auged anything else. Which I agree with. Which BoC is a very good weapon, but what it really means is a weapon aug'd with anger3 is a huge jump over un-aug'd weapons.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If he had a SBoD anger augged and a CHSD unaugged and received a BoC, he would have been best served by mainhanding the BoC and offhanding the CHSD, stripping the aug off the SBoD and selling it and then working on anger augging the BoC with A3.</div></div><hr />

If you are right, I would use the boc offhand, mainhand the splitblade of destrcution. Then work on anger3 for the BoC. Once the boc has anger3, mainhand it. Then wait til you pick up a gbos or osow, maybe even bf/hg/bbote to get rid of the splitblade. But then again I depise the CHSD<br />
<br />
(note: before someone who didn't read everything starts complaining, this post is assuming he already put anger3 on the splitblade. I know one person who did this with his alt warrior and it really is on par with an un-aug'd boc. although I wouldn't do it. I would anger3 a sotbs before a splitblade.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually if you are going for best bang for the buck right now, mainhand the BoC, offhand the anger aug'd SBoD.  Isn't the anger proc on the BoC more hate than A3, it's 700 vs 600 right?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, actually it is great aggro.  Wanna know the difference?<br />
<br />
1) a shitload of proc dps (in favor of Copper Hammer/SoD).<br />
<br />
2). A very small amount of overall hate.<br />
<br />
3). 400kp.<br />
<br />
It wasn't a difficult choice to make for me.  The Blade of Carnage just does not cut it with the price tag it carries.  Will it hold aggro?  Absolutely.  Is it the godsend everyone who hates droga weapons is looking for?  Absolutely not.  The aggro difference is NOT that noticable, and then it just comes down to a few HP on the BoC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Haass, they are talking about SBoD not sceptre of desutrction. SBoD sucks sell that PoS.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Crystara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">The original poster used the wrong acronym, they are talking about Split Blade of Destruction, which is a horrendously crappy weapon and I also suggest you sell it.  Stick with the BoC and CHSD for now. <br />
<br />
Sceptre of Destruction, while also expensive, is a good choice as well, I would rate it just below a BoC as far as droppable aggro weapons go, with the droga weapons being next after those.  If you can find Sceptres for sale, they are worth picking up instead of a BoC due to usually being around half the cost and being so close in aggro that you wont really notice much of a difference.</div></div><hr />

they just dont drop anymore ...  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>didiaquarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Wielding BoC and an Anger II aug'ed SoD (Sceptre of Destruction, just be clear).  Have not yet had the opportunity or inclination to aug the BoC.  Aggro, as one would expect, is much better with the aug'ed SoD mainhand and the BoC offhand.  <br />
<br />
In fact its just dandy to the point where I haven't treated aug'ing the BoC as a great priority.  I'm just at the point where I'm getting into Hard LdoN's a lot so I find myself warming up mobs with dual weild and then swapping to a 2hander so the cleric doesn't have a heart attack keeping me up.  <br />
<br />
I got the SoD from a RL friend (last one to drop on Xev, actually... may Hawkestone rot forever even after disbanding) and the BoC by whuppin the AoW.  I agree with those who say that both of these weapons are over priced.  Yes, the aggro is great.  Is it better than, say, a copper hammer and bloodsworn?  Yes.  But is it worth paying around 500k (on Xev) for that extra aggro?  Up to you. <br />
<br />
Anyway, to get back to the original poster's point:  <br />
<br />
1.  Yes.  BoC procs and is a fantastic aggro weapon, but doesn't mow your lawn or freak out and aggro everything in a 10 mile radius. <br />
<br />
2.  Aug the BoC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Mistikat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">HG ain't got inceased proc rate, just using it comparitively with the BoC, should'nt a lumped it in there with the increased proc rate weps.  My bad. Is a BoC a godsend? Yup. SotBS and CHoS = ~400 hate per proc whereas the BoC is 700. 300 more aggro is 300 more aggro, might save a caster. If BoC's weren't lore I'd be dual-wielding them, as I can't get my hands on a BF or BBoTE.  Screw a SotBS to the wall, right next to the CHoS. All the resisted stun procs in the world won't match a raw, unresistable  700 hate per proc. Not to mention 15/20 ratio and stats. Sorry.   ( I am currently wielding a SOtBS in my off-hand, waiting patiently for a GBoS or OSoW to drop for me, then its off to the bonfire with it, to be melted down. hehe )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Doesn't matter if the stun procs are resisted, it's still ~400 aggro.  Of course the BoC at 700 aggro is better.  But consider the damage from the proc on a weapon like the SoD, sure the ratio and stats aren't as good as a BoC but the proc damage makes up for it, and I'm sure the proc damage also accounts for a minimal amount of hate on top of that ~400.  Sure the BoC is better for aggro, but not by much.  Especially in comparison to a CHoS or SotB, BoC is marginally better aggro for about 40-50x the price of either weapon.  For the price of a BoC you could have a CHoS, SotB, and still have enough for a complete set of ornate or near to it.  Sure, if you are rolling in cash or in a guild that can get you a BoC or better then great, but if you aren't then you're better off spending your funds elsewhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">The general rule when considering BoC or SoD should be this -<br />
<br />
If there is ANY bazaar traded item that is a significant upgrade for you in any slot, then you shouldn't be buying either weapon. Period. Unless your gear is so good that anything you find in the bazaar is just a marginal weapon, your PP will be better spend filling in every other slot you have. The boring ass every-warrior-and-his-second-cousin-has-these droga weapons will give you 95% of the agro of an SoD and 75% of a BoC for less than 10% of the price of either.<br />
<br />
As for the original poster, A3 the BoC and weild it mainhand with the Split blade offhand. The split blade+A3 is a better weapon than the unaugmented CHSD. I wouldn't waste an aug on the CHSD because you should be able to get a GBoS which is far superior. Once you get your hands on a GBoS, sell the split blade and buy yourself some more upgrades.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think Wandor's advice makes the most sense, you'll get the most bang for your buck right now with the BoC primary, SBoD with A3 secondary, then when you get an upgrade to the SBoD sell it for other upgrades.<br />
<br />
I knew I shouldn't do it when I bought my SoD to replace my SotB...   even though there were a couple good ornate upgrades I could have gotten instead.  But I just couldn't resist...  I really like the SoD, the proc on it, the look, and I find it gets noticed which I also like.  I also find that at my level I can tank anything I need to really well, and I know that by the time I need to tank tougher mobs I'll have upgraded my gear again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A fool and his money are easily parted.  If you think the BoC is 390-490kpp better than a Copper Hammer, you're sadly mistaken, but whatever floats your boat I guess.<br />
<br />
I'm actually REALLY surprised that the BoC hasn't dropped in price yet, because no one should EVER be wielding one of those anymore.  If you're bazaar equipped, save yourself a fuckton of cash and get droga weapons.  If you got it from raiding, well then Ssra is just around the corner, pick up your bloodfrenzy/BBoTE.</div></div><hr />

Out of 37 kills I have seen this 6 times. Very rare, but I would have to agree with Haass.</div></div><hr />

was nice to get all our warriors in guild a BoC in one fail swoop (minus, of course, an applicant/trialmember).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Yeah dont buy a BoC, nothing is worth 400K, hell I can't think of many things that are worth even 100K other than a fast drogmar / horse. That said just cause people aren't recommending buying a BoC with plat, doesnt mean that the weapon sucks.  The BoC rules, if your guild is killing AoW snap one up if you can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Omnus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Actually if you are going for best bang for the buck right now, mainhand the BoC, offhand the anger aug'd SBoD.  Isn't the anger proc on the BoC more hate than A3, it's 700 vs 600 right?<br />
<br />
Yes anger3 is 600, eb is 700.<br />
<br />
The if you put 14/19 main hand, 15/20 offhand, is going to be better dps than if they are the other way around. And most situations you just need a proc, whether it is 600 or 700.</div></div><hr />
