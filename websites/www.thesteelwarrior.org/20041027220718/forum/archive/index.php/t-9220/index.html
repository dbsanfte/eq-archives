<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kahzul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, Ive finally begun two boxing my toons, Im currently using my 63 Shaman and my 53 Barbwarrior. I am at about 3500 unbuffed, is that on track?  Most of my gear is the Barbarian cultural and while its not fantastic it works for me now.. Im rappidly approaching lvl 55 where I will gladly go to the Plane of Valor.  My shaman has camped there on numerous occasions and the tansk Ive run into there seem to have a bunch more hp and ac then I do and Im not sure what route I should take so that I can become an effective tank in PoV and not be relagate to being an OT.. I made my warrior so I could be the one in the mobs face, no stuck like a pallly or an Sk sitting on the sidelines and off tanking.  Any help at all would be gladly appreciated.. I do keep a full rallic pack of Misty thicket picnics and  Qyenoes Afternoon tea in my food slot.  Thankyou for the help I lookforward to hearing from you.. FYI I have about 20k saved up to spend.. Thanks again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kahzul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">wow, someone have something against Barb warriors? lol..</div></div><hr />

I can't get your Magelo to come up (&quot;file ain't here&quot;).<br />
3,500 hps unbuffed certainly seems &quot;on track&quot; to me at 53. Would partly depend on your AC though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bolomir Moonmist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Only thing i can even think of replacing..is your shoulders.  Need to get some hp on those bad boys  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yes, that's right--Tribunal shoulders, even, would be better.<br />
At that point, you're pretty much in cultural/slightly better stuff and that's good at 53. You can think about LDoN augments for the weapons at that point (or, for that matter, right now).<br />
I would say, though, that Halas 10-pound meat pies (dex/sta/agi 5, hps 30) would be slightly better for you than MTPs (str/sta/wis/int 5, hp 20) -- and cheaper.<br />
Grobb liquidised meat (str/sta 6; int/wis -1) would get you +6 Sta at the loss of 5 Dex over the Qeynos afternoon tea, and most warriors with unmaxed sta would rather have it than dex. (the +6 str on the Grobb and the +5 AGI on the Qeynos being more or less trivial). However, Tribunal armor is heavy on the STa and light on dex, so you might not want to bother if you already have a bunch of tea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Athrias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">As other people have said, get a new shoulder item, something with some HPs on it.<br />
<br />
Other than that, maybe get a Nightmarewood Compound Bow. It'll give ya a little boost to your dex, as well as a chance to get an early aggro proc on incoming if you get lucky. The Sv. magic doesn't hurt either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kahzul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Guys, I cant say how happy I am to get some good info there.. I appreciate it emmensly..IM gonna go about trying to get some good shoulders.. Unfortunatly Im on the Drinal server and stationed in Okinawa and when I log on its a graveyard.  Thanks again..</div></div><hr />
