Winter's Fury<br />
Jade Mace<br />
Lamentation<br />
Jarsarth Trident<br />
<br />
I am lvl 30,<br />
I am currently using WF main and JM offhand, I was curious when it would be optimal to switch to JM primary and WF offhand (which I believe is the optimal weapon configuration out of the ones I have)<br />
Also is there any other exceptional 1handed weapon i should be looking for for around 4k?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dunderho</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 11:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In this dwarfs opinion you should use the Jade Mace (or Lamentation) primary and Winter's Fury off hand.  I used a Jade Mace primary, Jarsarth Trident off hand, in the past.  ..then moved to Jade Mace primary, Frostbringer secondary.  With your budget - if your looking for a decent 2HS ya might want ta look at a Black Acrylia Halberd.  It has decent stats and I've seen them ranging around 2500pp to 4000pp on Emarr server.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You have those at 30?<br />
<br />
Haha, well in another &quot;when I was a noob we used langsaex's and we damn happy to have them&quot; reply....I had almost that exact weapon selection up to about level 55.<br />
<br />
And with that selection I always used Lammy main, Winter's Fury offhand.<br />
<br />
I used the Lammy over the JM because 1 delay wasn't worth giving up stats and HP on the Lammy.<br />
<br />
EDIT: However, I used those like that because of my Main hand damage bonus which you don't get yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lajiskin</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 11:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the replies.<br />
The BAH is a nice weapon for sure, but how is it for holding aggro?  Also its subpar before lvl 45.<br />
Keep in mind I am only 30 as of writing this, and I know that lammy/WF is better in the high end, but at what point does the dmg bonus make up for the superior ratio of the WF?<br />
<br />
also frostbringer is pointless before 50 when it procs, WF has a better ratio.<br />
<br />
Good point on the lammy over JM btw, will start swapping those from now on, and the JM can go to my monk twink ;)<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

Switch around only to get skill ups faster in Blunt or piercing.<br />
<br />
Personally, I would sell the Lamentation and buy a cheap 2hb and 2hs to keep your skill up.  Do not neglect these skills.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you go lammy and then find yourself wondering why you can't hold aggro over a monk who's using a Goranga Club or a Jade Mace primary ... it's because that 1 delay IS worth giving up stats and hp for.<br />
<br />
;-)<br />
<br />
Jade Mace &gt; Lamentation every day of the week and twice on Tuesdays if you're trying to hold aggro over high DPS classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Roehm</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 02:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bah, bah I say.<br />
<br />
First off, that was before GSC's and all the Luclin mudflated weapons (or Velious for that matter).<br />
<br />
And I did test it extensively by pulling aggro off 2 equal level epic equipped monks over the course of 2 levels in HS.<br />
<br />
Now having said that, you have a point with today's mudflated weapons you want all the edge you can get to hold aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunrack</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 03:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have many weapons but decided at the end to just use these 2 instead of all the rest I have...<br />
<br />
Primary Hand<br />
Guard Captain's Mallet=(11 DMG 20 DLY +45 HP +6 AGI +6 DEX, Ratio being 0.55)  <br />
<br />
Secondary Hand<br />
Centi Longsword=(14 DMG 27 DLY +8 STR, +8 STA, Ratio being 0.518)  <br />
<br />
My goals with these 2 weapons is as much DPS as possible but... primarily.. AGRO... are these 2 weapons any good?  So far my results are horrid as far as &quot;grabbing agro&quot; back from a caster or hybrid... as in.. if they pull grabbinb agro back with those weapons has been nearly impossible... now.. there are a couple of things that could be affecting this but I am unsure if they are true. . first.. it mostly happens with yellow and red /cons   so... does warrior taunt not work at all on higher /con mobs until a certian level?<br />
<br />
These are my other weapons... I have all these to choose from but I choose the ones above instead.. the jade mace I don't actually have but could find one quit easily.. so question would be.. for agro maintaining.. and good DPS... should I swap any of my weapons for one of these instead?  including the jade mace?<br />
<br />
Crystalline Short Sword ( 12 DMG 24 DLY, +4 AGI, +6 INT, +6 CHA, +4 STR, Ratio Being 0.5) <br />
<br />
Jade Mace=( 9 DMG 18 DLY, Ration being 0.50)<br />
<br />
EDIT:  Also the reason I put the Centi on the off hand is because I was told that delay didn't matter much on the offhand and that off hand melee hits do not get damage bonuses.. only main hands.. don't know if thats true either.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Stick with the ones you have.  They will last you easily into the 50's.  Neither of the two you mentionned are better DPS wise and I doubt aggro wise as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mokor</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 07:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">58 is the point where db edges out ratio, also fast in main helps with dps agro. look into a black blade of tormenting, 500ish pp many agree way nice proc agro. dunno what lvl it procs though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbo Baggins</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 09:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">frostbringer is 4k on some servers. or guard captains mallet. both great choices.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neksnappa</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 11:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some other weapons to keep an eye out for:<br />
<br />
Venemous Axe of the Velium Brood. It's 11dmg 24dly, procs an 85 DD at level 35. Great weapon for aggro if your dex is decent (100+) and cheap too. Commonly seen selling for 600-700pp on the nameless.<br />
<br />
Barnacle Covered Axe. 9dmg 21dly, 5ac 8sta 5 MR. Proc is Pique- 50dd and +100 hate. &lt;Ghetto frosty ;)&gt; I used this for a while grouped at 42 and 43. When it procced, aggro was mine. Period. Seemed to be very inconsistant though. I think my record was 4 procs in one fight. Longest number of mobs without a proc was over a dozen. Anyways, prices vary on this one. 1200-2200pp on the nameless<br />
<br />
Those two weapons both are great for aggro, I'd advise you to keep an eye out in the bazaar for a good deal on either.</div></div><hr />
