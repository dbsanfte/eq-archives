<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Angelusx</div><div class="date">02-02-2004, 02:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I made a thread about what I should aug my royals gear with.. It just turned into an arguement with no answers.. <br />
<br />
What I would like for the 3 augs in my set of royals gear is. AC, hp, and vengance. Is this combination possible, if so, what camps would I have too get them from. I've got about 10k of points banked so please, Points are not an issue.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bulbog</div><div class="date">02-02-2004, 02:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh sorry but it seems funny that you'd have access to so many points but don't know where to get the stuff.  Here's the answer though: Edit(Redoing veng part to work around lore)  <br />
<br />
Gravestone of Aggresion- V3- 510 points- chest- butcherblock. <br />
Cold Slimestone of Fury- V4- 1450 points- greaves- guk.<br />
Polished Sandstone of Ire- V3- 1150- boots- EC.<br />
Pristine Limestone of Hatred- V3- 1150- helm- guk.<br />
Gravestone Fragment of Battle Mastery- Battle of Aura(10atk)- 1150- gaunts- butcherblock<br />
Dull Sandstone of Ire- V2- 510- arms- north ro.<br />
Translucent Ore of Courage- Aura of Corage(10atk)-  760- wrist- EC<br />
Scarred Limestone of Vegeance- V1- 220- wrist- Guk<br />
Gravestone Fragment of Flailing Dead- 36% haste- 1150- helm- Butcherblock<br />
<br />
What I listed above is if you're going all out attack.  I'd switch the crappy V1/V2 stuff with enduring breath in there somewhere or see invis or dodge or something fun eh.<br />
<br />
Now you have Hp slots.  These are from Tak(1150 points)  So again, 8 type 2 slots on armor so 9200 for full hp.<br />
<br />
From there do whatever you want with the type 1 slots, fill them up with the decent type 1 vendor augs like 10svd/svp one or +10sta or wait for trash augs to drop during clears.</div></div><hr />

Just visit 'The Library' for links to LDoN camps and Augs. Take a bit of time and research them. Don't forget usefuly augs like See Invis and Enduring Breath.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">02-02-2004, 03:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For LDoN Plate in you can add :<br />
T1 : Stats / Resists or  RandomShit01<br />
T2 : Raw HP<br />
T3 : Various Effects <br />
<br />
Various effect are :<br />
- Dodge Mod<br />
- Regen<br />
- ATK<br />
- Utility (haste/eb/ultravision/infravision/DS) etc etc<br />
<br />
I'd say go with utility first, and once these are settled.<br />
Make a choice.  ATK or Regen ?<br />
<br />
It depends on what you want.<br />
Full ATK is great, you should gain 15-20% More DPS<br />
Full Regen, will help efficiency &amp; survivability.<br />
<br />
Since you are a big part of your groups dps (i assume) ATK would be wise.<br />
Regen30 is 18000hp healed in 1 hour (thats 4 CH).<br />
But i do not think in your case it will make a difference.<br />
While +20% DPS on yourself probably will.<br />
<br />
I raid 90% of the time. And i have 250atk. <br />
I would trade those 250atk for 250hp if i could.<br />
On a raid my DPS is irrelevant.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ps : 12/15hp are Type7 now<br />
Ps : We were not arguing about ATK vs RGN but on bying T1 augments.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Beyond that,  <br />
for atk <br />
Guk 1450 Aug3 Cold Slimestone of Fury Lore, Effect:Veng.IV <br />
Guk 1150 Aug3 Pristine Limestone of Hatred Lore,Effect:Veng.IV  <br />
Ruj 760 Aug3 Polished Sandstone of Ire Lore, Effect:Veng.III <br />
Mmc 510 Aug3 Gravestone of Aggression Lore, Effect:VengIII <br />
They are all LORE<br />
<br />
<br />
For ac all of the augments with + ac are limited to Face, Neck, Shoulder, Back, Waist so augmenting your Royal's gear with ac doens't seem to be an option at this time.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hitpoint augments for slot 2 are simple <br />
Guk 760 Aug2 Magnetite Shard of Stalwartness HP:30<br />
Tak 1150 Aug2 Glowing Saphire of Courage HP:40  <br />
These are not lore to my knowledge.<br />
<br />
Yours<br />
Brutall</div></div><hr />

The other thread, the question was answered thoroughly. AND Sam's link works fine too and is found in the library. Didn't think there needed to be a SECOND thread on the same exact topic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Boff</div><div class="date">02-02-2004, 05:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Uhhhh You know, augs are only lore BEFORE you augment them. After you augment them they are no longer lore... or is this different for vengance items</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fynepisa</div><div class="date">02-02-2004, 06:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The augments are lore all the time. You can only have 1 of any of the lore augments. All the bought effect augments (veng, regen, ft) are lore, and pretty much nothing else is.</div></div><hr />
