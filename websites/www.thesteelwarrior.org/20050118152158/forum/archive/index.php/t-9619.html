<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RystarVZ</div><div class="date">11-03-2004, 03:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dont know who here has contact with anyone from sony (maybe the Warrior Correspondent), but could someone send this to sony.<br />
<br />
  What I want is, could they make a one time turn in for the Warrior epic that will make it a 2h instead of a 1h. I think this is reasonable due to the fact that the epic was made as a utility weapon for either DPS or argo. I know this because of the 2 aug slots and no inate argo proc. <br />
For us Warriors if we choose to use the epic as a dps weapon if falls short due to the fact that alot of our AA's are better used 2h. I for one would love to turn in my epic for a 2h version due the the pvp aspect of my sever (I play on Vallon Zek), and I am sure that alot of the Warriors on Blue servers would also like to at least have the option because if they had Time 1hers there epic 2h would be a nice dps weapon during raids in which they are not Tanking. <br />
  My suggested resolution for this just keep the stats, effects for our epic just make it a 2h version in regards to ratio and skill.  Can even have it just turned into the epic starting NPC.<br />
<br />
Current epic <br />
Skill 1h Slashing <br />
28 Dmg 26 Dly <br />
20 str 20 dex 30 sta 25 cha 235 hp 190 endur <br />
20 svd 20 svc 25 svm <br />
3% Shielding <br />
Effect - Krekk's Presence <br />
Effect - Vengeful Scorn <br />
Slot 1, type 4 <br />
Slot 2, type 8 <br />
<br />
<br />
Requested 2h Version <br />
Skill 2h Slashing <br />
70 Dmg 40 Dly (Same as Pally?) <br />
20 str 20 dex 30 sta 25 cha 235 hp 190 endur <br />
20 svd 20 svc 25 svm <br />
3% Shielding <br />
Effect - Krekk's Presence <br />
Effect - Vengeful Scorn <br />
Slot 1, type 4 <br />
Slot 2, type 8 <br />
<br />
<br />
In summary this would make the epic more useful to alot of us, I dont feel this request will be that hard to do and will make a very wide range of player base very happy. Please feel free let them know the request came from me and I would love to talk with them about this if they would like anymore information.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Get over it, and this won't happen, war's a dual wield class and thier epic refelects that just like the knights have 2hs, the monks h2h, the rogue 1hp, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">11-04-2004, 05:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">While I highly doubt it would happen, I do not think it would be a bad idea.  In fact, extend it a little bit to all classes.  A pally could turn in his 2hs for a 1hs(making them insanely happy), a monk could turn theirs in for a 2hb, a ranger for a bow or a 2 hander.  Hell, make epics turn inable for any type weapon your class can equip.  Custimazation at that level I think would be very good for the game, tho would require a little extra work doing the graphics for all the different type weapons and making the stats balanced for the different types(the big problem with turning in a 1 hander for a 2 is that you loose all those stats you had with whatever you had equipped in the other hand.<br />
<br />
Not something I would call a big, huge, burning issue, but I think it would be kinda neat, kinda fun, and would add a little bit to the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Trust me, they don't care what 2hs you want. Suggest it can change over, sure, but I guarantee they dont give 2 squirts about what item stats the players want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goradain</div><div class="date">11-04-2004, 04:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Warriors get 2H skills and AAs.  Just because they have Dual-Wield does not mean that it is all they should use.  Knights and Warriors should get a Bastard sword-style weapon (AKA - Hand-and-half sword, meaning usable as 2H or 1H).  Anyone remember in Diablo how swords could be used as 2H or 1H?  The stats would have to adjust to which skill was being employed, however.  I don't think it's a bad idea at all.  I personally prefer 2H for tanking.<br />
<br />
And Pumilio it isn't really necessary to make an ass of yourself every time you post here.  Sure, it's extremely remote that it would even be considered, but that doesn't mean it isn't a good suggestion and worthy of being discussed by the players.</div></div><hr />
