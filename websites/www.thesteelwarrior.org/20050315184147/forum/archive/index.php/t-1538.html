<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">scrab1</div><div class="date">06-26-2003, 03:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Was wondering if any of you out there have tips for how to deal with AE rampage.  My raid force is pretty heavily melee and AE rampage fights rip through us like a lawnmower.  We usually win thanks to &quot;nothing to nerf here la~&quot; COD pet(s), but the kill isnt quite as satisfying when 3/4 of the raid force is lying around dead.  Its also not satisfying when 3/4 of the raid force has to sit back plinking arrows and applauding the pet.<br />
<br />
I've heard that there is a small small range between max AE rampage range and max melee range.  My melee friends swear that pretty much doesnt exist.  They resort to jousting and hope their number doesnt come up while inside range.<br />
<br />
Any pointers on positioning from a MT perspective or from a DPS melee perspective would be appreciated.  The AE Rampage mobs we are practicing on now are Diaku Overseer, Anival, and Tagrin.  <br />
<br />
Im hoping there is some way to apply skill or tactics instead of &quot;reroll a wizard or ranger and accept that melees are useless in POP&quot;. :p<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
Best people to watch generally are rogues cause most of them are already pretty well trained at staying at max meele range.<br />
<br />
Te mobs you mentioned arent super good to practice on I dont think because none of them gets pinned generally (we did those mobs with single groups + cod pets 99% of the time so there wasnt a need to pin them).</div></div><hr />

<br />
the space between rampage and melee range should be made just a tad bigger though, no doubt.<br />
<br />
most ppl are going to pet kill overseer, he just doesnt have that much hp. plenty of stuff to charm for enchanties and druids. you do need a real tank at least now though.<br />
<br />
casters and rangers own pop though, get used to it, stuff needs to be killed fast so mana doesnt run out they own for burst dmg.</div></div><hr />

If the mob one rounds you on AoE rampage, your pretty limited on strats.  I know of 5 mobs with this ability and we deal with each one differently.<br />

Fennins rampage is rape + his 3k ae so we dont use any melee, esp since his ae is still 100 range and i position him away from clerics.  Warlord in poe b is just rape..pretty much a zergfest.  If your refering to bertox he does NOT ae ramapage.  He just one shots a lot of people.  This is a bit easier now as he no longer roams so you can have a defensive warrior pull and take rampage easily.  He is pretty much a zerg fest until you get to elementals and get some hps but its fairly easy to isolate rampage and set up a druid heal rot on your rt.<br />
