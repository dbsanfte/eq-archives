I do not presume to know much about warriors to be honest.  But i have been reading alot of your website over the last few weeks to get a better understanding of some problems we are having.<br />
<br />
The first thing i will say is we are experienceing some difficulties with two things. The first is our MT's are between 61 63 while our wizards are level 65.  The MT's are having some diffiucltie holding aggro and most of this i believe is do to theier weapons.  We are a NTOV/1st Tier Pop type guild.  My first priority is raidng for weapons for our warriors to hold aggro since that is our main prolem atm.  I would like to equip about 5 warriors.  How do you feel about the cord hilted spike driver form POI with the trident of the deep sea from NTOV? Do you think that would be sufficient to generate a good amount of agro?  can you make a suggestion on better weapons?  <br />
<br />
The second problem is MTs stealign aggro for each other because they have similiar setups.  So we need a DPS weapon to replace The aggro weapons with.  Cna you make a suggestion on waht weapons a guidl coudl get for our warriors to allow them to do some dps without stealing aggro?<br />
<br />
thank you <br />

P.S Greatstaff of Thunder is difficult for us to get at this time do to the number of people we have flagged compared to the pvp force we would need to field.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sangiovese</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">CHSD and copper hammer of striking would be a good aggro setup that you guys should be able to get.<br />
<br />
And yes, having your non-mt warriors using something so they dont steal aggro is a good idea.  I would recommend using 2HS... either windblades or TSBS.  <br />
<br />
If that isn't what you want, then just have them offhand their best aggro weapon, and switch it to main when they MT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Next step for you is to move into Ssra and get some EB, or its time to do AoW for BoC's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hyardgune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Jakle, I don't know about your server but certainly on mine the top guilds bottomfeed the hell out of Ssra and AoW, finding those mobs up is nearly impossible.  Nothing quite like groups from Elemental guilds killing Ssra mobs to gear up their alts to make otherwise Ssra capable guilds really hope all the ubers quit when LDoN comes out.<br />
<br />
In answer to the original question, since you are NToV capable, definitely work on gearing up your warriors with the TSBS off Eashen.  Good for dps and shouldn't steal aggro too often.  Outright buying GoTs rather than trying to deal with getting Middle South camps in BoT might be your easiest bet for 2h aggro weapons.  The hammer and sword from Droga should be well within your grasp also.  Xanamech isn't too hard although my guild has only done it with 65 warriors.  So far only one sword off Xanamech but we have horrible luck with those kinds of things.<br />
<br />
Once you have more folks in the 62+ range, try Auliffe in BoT for the Greatstaff of Four Winds to replace the TSBS.<br />
<br />
Anyway, your best bets for gearing up your warriors in aggro weapons is xp/loot groups in Droga, raids on Xanamech, and buying GoTs.  For dps, beat Eashen like a drum until you get a TSBS for everyone.</div></div><hr />
