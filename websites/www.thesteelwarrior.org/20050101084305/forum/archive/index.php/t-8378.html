<br />
Does taunt affect a mezzed mob?  Or is it better to use taunt after mez has been broken?<br />
<br />
I've experimented some on my own, no parses or any kind of hard evidence, but i've found that taunt works better on un-mezzed mobs.  Is this just me or does anyone have any info to help me out?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

If I get a good taunt, mob stays on me, if I don't get a good taunt, it paws at the chanter.  I usualy try for a taunt, incite, break.  if the chanter takes a hit...well they should have rune up, I'm not wasting our time on another taunt he he.</div></div><hr />

This is exactly what works for me.  If I just Incite, mob goes for mezzer.  If taunt fails, mob goes for mezzer.  1 non-failed Taunt, 1 Incite and then break will 99% of the time keep the mob on you after breaking in my experiences.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">08-03-2004, 07:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If there are multiple mobs in camp, I make sure to have my back to any mezzed mobs. While we are killing on target, I will toggle to the mezzed target I plan to kill next and  taunt until I get a success. Once I get a success I drop an incite on it. By the time the current target is dead, all you have to do is wake up the mezzed mob and it should stick to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">08-04-2004, 12:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah,normally upon reaching between 10-20 pct on my present target ,I attack off move to my next and taunt till success and incite.Or well if taunt is sucking I just hit it and let the chanter tank. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">08-04-2004, 12:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When I'm not feeling lazy I do the same thing as Wandor.  Make sure my back is to the mezzed mob (or turn off attack for a second) and taunt until I get a success.  I just hit taunt, then go back to the mob I'm fighting, and use the &quot;toggle last two targets&quot; key to go back and forth when taunt refreshes.  Then when the other mob dies you have Mez+slow+incite aggro and you can break mez immediately.<br />
<br />
To answer the original question, yes taunt definitely works on mezzed mobs.</div></div><hr />

And imo if you want to be a good tank you should never break mezz to you have a successful Taunt and then incite. I would say do not incite before you get a success Taunt unless the mob wakes up early.</div></div><hr />

in a perfect world this would be true.  In our world taunt fails 3x on a regular basis.  On some crappier streaks the mob will wake up and eat the mezzer long before you roll a successful taunt.  Incite helps a lot in getting it off the mezzer.  So does /shield (yea remember /shield? hehe)<br />
<br />
Dont forget that an enchanter remezzing the mob has a chance to wipe aggro, including yours that you just got from successfully taunting.  Bard aggro on the other hand, just needs an incite and the bard will be fine.  Of course the slower may have some words for you lol.</div></div><hr />

If taunt fails...I'll try once more.  If taunt fails again.  I'll bash the mob.  Gives at least a chance for stun, then start beating the hell out of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Froggerx Xreggorf</div><div class="date">08-05-2004, 12:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ya... taunt works as good as a broken car. <br />
<br />
<br />
i've had 24 consecutive failed taunts on General Reparm. <br />
<br />
about 18 on Drurav.<br />
<br />
in general exp groups in kodtaz/ikkinz or anywhere for that matter I fail taunt. Even on green mobs in WFP on the way to the pok book I failed taunt on a large rat... cmon a large rat.    This needs to be fixed, everyone should /feedback or something so this can be changed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xarilok</div><div class="date">08-05-2004, 09:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some mez spells and songs have a mem-blur component to them, so if the mob gets remezzed after you taunt, it will still go after the chanter.....I have never ever once seen a mob go after my bard after mez was broken tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">08-05-2004, 09:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bard spells have virtually no aggro to them.<br />
<br />
The chance of taunt succeeding on any uber is very slim.  It's supposed to be that way.  That's why there is AE Taunt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ibithor</div><div class="date">08-06-2004, 10:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">if at all possible make sure you have a good taunt before you use incite, even wake the mob then immediaely hit incite, you have a chance at much higher aggro than just by inciting whether taunt worked or not then waking. this is what i have noticed anyway i am assuming its for the following reasons<br />
<br />
1. incite is a set amount of hate, which means if the otehrs in group have more than that amount, incite was just wasted as they are stikll on top of the aggro list and IF you get a good taunt now you are only 1 ahead of them.<br />
<br />
2. incite is pure hate which i think i read doesnt take full effect unless you have damaged the mob at least one point<br />
<br />
3. taunt puts you on top of hate by 1 when it works, so the way i do it, i first beat everyone elses hate, then i hit the mob and use incite which jumps me up an instant 400 extra aggro plus whatever im churning out via procs and dps<br />
<br />
4. the only thing i have notice fucks up my aaggro method is if the person who i taunted off sits immedately after i get a good taunt and incite but before i get an aggro proc or a few hits in. i am guessing this is because with taunt/incite/no proc first hit i have 401-471 aggro on the mob, i read somewhere sitting is +500 hate which would put that person back on top if they were originally on top when i got a good taunt. generally the mob whacks the sitter once to stand him up and immediately flips back to me<br />
<br />
btw phan is right, you save ae taunt for boss mobs that you dont want hitting anyone else since it usually works assuming the mob is close to you</div></div><hr />
