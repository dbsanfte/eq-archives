<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been noticing that in CoH there is a real problem with people not respecting other people's play.  By that I mean you can be going along, knee deep in a fight that you have every confidence you'll win, when BLAM! out of no where someone starts beating your mobs.  Granted that you get to share exp with the other person if you both do damage to them, but am I the only one annoyed by people just jumping in with complete disregard for others?  Usually if I see someone fighting, I might stop, check their health, see how they're doing against what they're fighting, maybe lend a hand if it looks really iffy or if it's obvious they're running away, but otherwise I leave them alone and go on my merry way.<br />
<br />
Lots of people don't do this.  In fact I've had entire groups just plow through my mobs, those that are actively engaged by me, and every other mob along an entire city block with complete and absolute disregard for anyone and everyone.  What's up with this?  Are people really just that idiotic and rude or have I just been unlucky in my experiences?<br />
<br />
Usually I don't even bother to say anything, because what's the point?  But it does annoy me at times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Alot of people dont understand what KSing is, they couldnt unless they had done EQ or DoAC or something prior, and since this is the super hero genere im sure there are a fair amount of super n00bs learning the jargon and the ropes for the first time.<br />
<br />
Yes it does piss me off, that is why im making a villian when CoV launchs, i have a list /evil grin</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bourbon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ya, it's a big problem.  My favorite reponse when you tell them to get the fuck off your mobs is &quot;Oh, like there isn't a million things to kill around here&quot;,  Ya great, then how bout you go find the 999,999 mobs I'm not currently fighting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">get out of the newbie zones. things pan out well. hell; once i started hunting more in King's row i've met people who just come by and ninja-heal me; help split mobs up; offer groups; just chat and say hi; trade stuff; and all other nice stuff while busting up mobs.<br />
<br />
you can't forget while in newbie zones the non-commital types who have nothing better to do than level up to 5 and re-roll just like killing stuff ala Unreal Tournament. remove yourself from the equation; and the solution presents itself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Actually Shikarii, most of my run ins have been in Kings Row and Steel Canyon.  I don't spend much time in the newbie zones, because for the most part I mission my way out of them pretty fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bloodslake</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I nearly got banned on the beta boards for cajoling the dev's to come up with a solution to the ks'ing.  I was highly vocal.  I didn't even swear and I received a warning e-mail /shrug<br />
<br />
I know there are a &quot;lot&quot; of new mmorpg people in this game.  I also know from L1-10 zones it is the worst.  SC - that shocks me.<br />
<br />
Several people said superheroes just wanna arrest everyone and superheroes help each other.  That is the person I went off on - justification for KS'ing.<br />
<br />
I loved playing my mind/storm controller.....except for the ksing.  I have the damage output of a weak nanny with a dull spoon and yet I have 4-5 mobs locked down all tidy like....I got KS'ed a &quot;lot&quot;.  So I rolled up a blaster.<br />
<br />
The devs have implemented a solution - sort of.  If you have a kill 10 skulls mission if you damage the mob by at least 25% you get credit for the kill.  This helps for the kill xx of YY missions but not the general happiness of engaging a mob anf having it taken from you AFTER you engaged it.  I feel your pain on this.<br />
<br />
I have decided to ignore it or sometimes approach people to educate them that ksing is not generally a good thing.  I explain especially a mob that is damaged and I am attacking - generally that means hands off.<br />
<br />
I hear you and understand - and it sucks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
that sucks :( ... i swear once i got out of atlas park things were better for me personally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Greyslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Oh man I feel your pain that crap irritates me to no end.  If I want help I'll F8 and blow the Whistle  :D .  Usually only time people take my mobs in higher lvl zones is the rare ones like CoT mobs etc. even though they are really common in Steel Canyon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I havent had problems in steel canyon, but i play late when the kiddies are forced to nap for school, summer is coming up tho  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bourbon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Same here, every really annoying jackass I've had to deal with so far have been in Kings Row/Steel Canyon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I moved my level 10 character, my second main, to Skyway City today, just past the Atlas Park zone in.  And let me tell you, it was night and day.  There was almost no one around.  The mobs weren't any harder than in Steel Canyon, in fact I'd say there were somewhat easier since they aren't nearly as intermixed with different types.  Didn't have anyone KS me or hassel me for several hours.  Even had my best solo fight ever, took out something like 8 white mobs all in one group.  Luckily only two were bruisers and the rest were gunners or buckshots, which do very light damage.  Never would have been able to do that in Steel Canyon without someone butting in, never.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Bloodslake</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">took out something like 8 white mobs all in one group.<br />
<br />
You studmuffin!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">It happens to my controller a lot. It can be very frustrating. I usually just grin and bear it though. It's pretty rampant in this game.<br />
<br />
So, when it finally gets me totally pissed off, I just log off, switch to MY BLASTER and go do it myself. <br />
