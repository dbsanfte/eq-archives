<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MSHMCM</div><div class="date">05-23-2003, 08:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey guys, I am currently a 36 Warrior on the SEventh Hammer, not superly equppied, but not too bad off either...my prob is a bit of boredom.  I am very bored, I run around all day /ooc 36 War LFG PST and get one group that lasts for about an hour before they all disband then I am stuck again...I love my warrior, and wouldn't trade to another class for anything, I have worked on fletching a small bit to pass the time, but to no avail.  What can you tell me to make life as a warrior more exciting, where are some good zones for finding groups?  Etc?  Any help or wise words you could offer are greatly appreciated<br />

<br />
At 36 your best bets to find a group are probably going to be in Gunthak, Dreadlands, Overthere specifically. Most other areas your level (if anything like my server) Will be one desolate place, especially since warriors are so easily 'twinked' out with gear much too powerful for their level. If you're wearing actual gear intended for someone your level you might find yourself critisized by potential groups for no good reason.<br />
<br />
I know 36 is probabaly a big accomplishment for you, but if I personally were forced to start over again from level 1 it would be on the breand new 'newbie' server Stromm, or Firiona Vie where you will probably be more likely to find people your level range properly equipped and eager to group.</div></div><hr />

Never gone to new zones so can't comment. If you can get a few ppl who want to go xp for awhile, I'd go to SolB and reap the xp bonus.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">05-23-2003, 04:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The biggest problem with mid level melee's lfg is that most of the low to mid level casters are getting KEI and soloing.  They get xp faster that way than they do grouped, a lot faster. (My shaman did anyway).  If they implement the code changes that keep lower level characters from benefitting from things like KEI, the balance may shift back to people actually wanting to group with you again.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GSW</div><div class="date">05-23-2003, 05:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, a great idea would be find some friends to group with on a regular basis, or at least once a week. Also, like Braeorn said, DL is the place where all the mid levels go on Povar. Last time i checked OT there were only 9 people there, but i'm sure there's more during peak hours. Sadly, most people want fast exp and sit in DL all the time here. Oh, and you can also do TOFS if you can find some people to go there with, it's a fun place.<br />
<br />
By the way, the gnome speaks the truth. I am a 63 warrior on Povar and sometimes like to get away from all the 60+ stuff, so i have a necro alt here and a mage alt on FV. There is more people in low level places on FV than on Povar, so you could try that(don't forget to RP!), or the new server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Babyblade</div><div class="date">05-24-2003, 05:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Howdy! I'm a warrior from Seventh Hammer, and when I leveled (which wasn't that long ago), I fought the tribals and Large Zelniaks in Dawnshroud Peaks for a long time. I didn't have much trouble finding a group there in the peak hours. Once you hit 38 or so, go to Dreadlands outside KC. That's the only place that late 30's - late 40's hang out. It will take you a while, but when you hit 50, head to the planes. After that, I don't know, because I'm only 53 myself. <br />
<br />
Send me a tell in-game if you need some help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">weoden</div><div class="date">05-24-2003, 10:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I suggest to type /who all 36 and look to see where the lfg's are or just send random tells to people in zone where xp can be found.  You might put together a group or happen into a group that is being power leveled.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Burarum</div><div class="date">05-25-2003, 06:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did 30-50 on Tholuxe Paells in about two months of casual playing (an hour here and there weeknights, a few hours on the weekends), so here's what I did:<br />
30-38:  The Overthere is usually the best place to go, but you can also try the Great Divide or Dawnshroud Peaks, all three places had plenty of groups during primetime (on TP).<br />
38-45:  The Dreadlands is your best bet IMO, there's usually at least 5 groups that will take you in.  Something else you might want to try is getting a healer to partner with in Dawnshroud Peaks, I got 40-43 in no time killing Large Zelniaks with a shaman<br />
45-47:  You can go to Karnor's Castle now, or even just stay in the Dreadlands.<br />
47-50:  I just did the Plane of Justice straight through, great xp, never any trouble finding a group, but you can always stay in Karnor's until about 50.<br />
Hope this helps!</div></div><hr />
