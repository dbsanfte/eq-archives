If so, anything I need to know about the trip over there? can I just invis most of the way?  What can I expect from him in terms of how hard he hits, how many HP, any mobs around him, and overall strategy?  Seems that any information on these LoY zones is extremely hard to come by, so any tips would be appreciated.  Thanks in advance<br />

<br />
I've never done him, but I think he hits in the 400's and has an AE silence that's sorta weak.  Most of the named down there are a lot harder than what their levels make them out to be.  I used to do Overseer Wrank and he's no brushover for being level 52.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry though, I have never done Taskmaster Lluga or Overlord Ngrub.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Taskmaster is a joke- just another trash mob in the way of Ngrubb IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cily</div><div class="date">07-18-2003, 07:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ngrub doesnt proc feeblemind, it is a timed AE which makes it a little easier to deal with.<br />
<br />
He does proc shadow step on his target, and often. Biggest problem this causes us is if it hits a charmed pet, it gates it to its spawn point. wee.<br />
<br />
Feeblemind is a curse, as such we normally have someone just chain curing a cleric, and that cleric keeps us alive with possibly another healer forcing heals through the feeblemind effect (you need some group healing cause he has a damage AE - think for 500DD. I seem to recall resisting it, but I know it has hit us enough where we needed healing.) /shrug<br />
<br />
Couple people in healer group with radiant cure does not hurt one bit =p<br />

Couple of us went down there last night to check it out and he wasn't up.  And could you perhaps tell me how you deal with all the spawns in his room?  I think I counted 24 of them, are they on a regular timer with the rest of the zone? Or longer?  Thanks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeryl</div><div class="date">07-18-2003, 03:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The AE is a pretty weak and fire based I think.  You have to kill all the spawns to get the Taskmaster to become targetable.  Then you kill him to make the Overlord targetable.  I've never seen the other mobs respawn during or after the fight, at least not before we left.</div></div><hr />
