If you were to actually share a character with a randomly chosen player, what do you do when the other person is not online?  Coordinating so that both players log on at the same time would be a total nightmare.  I just don't believe this is real and if it is real its pretty lame.</div></div><hr />

One of the fake screens (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/races/images/ogres/ss01.jpg) show you - the head falls asleep (leaving you with a one armed ogre under your control ...).  Actually, that's what playing a warrior felt like a few months ago. ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
You know if you could pick your partner......<br />
<br />
That would provide a refreshing playstyle.</div></div><hr />

I could pretend to be 2 different people! :p</div></div><hr />

it need improovement to be playable but it could lead to a all new definition of MMO.<br />
<br />
I think some improovement could be:<br />
 * the right arm follows order of the right head (obvious).<br />
 * the left arm follows order of the left head (obvious).<br />
 * the buttom (both legs) follows the last order from both head. explanation : both heads can control normally legs and feet, but in order to cut the priority issue the last order overite the current with no distinction of its source. ex: head right start to move foward. head left stop of a sudden. then if head right want to move ahaed again it has to repet its order. this will force communication and/or confidence between both head in critical moments.<br />
 * in order to have the best team work, it must be possible to choose our &quot;twin brother&quot;, and if we don't know any, a long questionnaire in order to associate player with the aproximate same play time and frequency, same goal, same style, ...<br />
 * if vocal command if implemented in WoW, then the use of vocal between the two heads will speed up and increase the playability.<br />
<br />
if this is develloped one day, and concidering the history a the former (original) blizzard team, i think it will be introduced in an expansion (however, probabilly not before one year and an half after the game release) and blow the game industry.<br />
<br />
<br />
just my two&quot; headded&quot; copper ;)<br />
