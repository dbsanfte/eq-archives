<br />
I am looking for some advice for gear upgrades in areas that I am lacking, namely my rings and earrings and neck piece.   I'v tried searching the bazaar which was very overwhelming.  I always seem to be poor, but money doesn't factor in my considerations if I need to save a bit.  I feel I have a decent AC for my level, so I am manly looking for anything with hps, stamina, and/or resists and did I mention hps? =) Any advice is welcome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Poosha</div><div class="date">02-11-2004, 02:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I'd certainly aim for more of that Helanic Tundra armor... great ac/hps.  Keep some cobalt for clickies if you want, but would probably be better just to sell it if you can.<br />
<br />
Other than that?  Head to the bazaar and do a search for Barbarian Warrior with the slot you're interested in (the non-visible ones if you decide to go with my first plan), and select hit points as the stat.  Use the Minimum and Maximum price fields to limit the search to a reaonable number (I often put in 500pp for minimum these days to eliminate all the stuff at the low-end).  Then click Find.  You can click on the &quot;Hit Point&quot; column to sort the list by that value, and go from there.  Just have to be careful of stuff that has some hitpoints but no ac (like some crafted jewellery).<br />
<br />
My brain's not working well enough at the moment to make many more suggestions, but it would definitely help if we knew whether you had a guild or friends to help you get some upgrades.  There's a lot of good stuff out there that can be gotten with even a single group.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">paladiin</div><div class="date">02-11-2004, 11:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep, go with Helanic Tundra.  I'd say you'd want it for your BP, shoulders, feet, arms, and legs.  It'll keep your AC high, but give you much needed HP, as you're a little low in that very important department.<br />
<br />
For your neck, I really like the Amulet of Mummy Wrappings - keep your eye on the bazaar and try to pick one up cheap.  On the same note, Vallorium Rings of Gallantry would also give you a nice boost in stats.<br />
<br />
Your Wolf Fang Earring needs upgrading.  I'd suggest a Jagged Bone Hoop if you're poor, and a Bloodmetal Earring of Engagement if you're not.  <br />
<br />
Then there's your belt.  I'd suggest gathering up a group and heading to Veksar for a Soulscream Belt, or to Droga for the haste belt that drops there (I always forget its name).  Both are 31% with good stats, and well within the reach of a group at your level.  <br />
<br />
Last suggestion, though it's minor.  I notice you're wielding that Widebladed Greatsword with a GSoT bagged.  Unless you are specifically wielding the Widebladed in a DPS role where you don't want to get agro, the GSoT will be a superior choice. Certainly the GSoT should be used for your tanking duties.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Santhar</div><div class="date">02-12-2004, 03:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'll look into that jagged bone hoop today.  I'm saving adventure points for a decent merchant item for the back/waist that i can stick a haste aug on.  As for the GSoT, I do whip it out when I am main tank. I just like the looks and stats of the wideblade in the magelo better =). Thanks again</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">02-13-2004, 09:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is only a minor point, but in your bag you have rations and water flasks. If you do use stat bonus food and drink (and simply haven't bothered to list them in your profile) ignore this post.<br />
But if not, while you're in the bazaar, you might search for stat bonus food and drink--some of it is dirt cheap for what you get and once you figure out how to use it, in theory a stack of, say, Halas 10-pound meat pies would last forever.<br />
Also, some of this stuff has fire and cold saves, which, given your low resist using your best armor, is a nice (though small) bump.<br />
Some common stat bonus foods:<br />
<br />
Halas 10-pound meat pies (Dex +5, STA+5, AGI +5, HP+30)--very cheap, very common, very long-lasting. Requires a giant-sized container, but really ought to be the minimum stat food you use because it's so cheap and because it looks like you're a Barbarian anyway so RAARRRR EAT BIG MEAT PIES. They are so good, and so good for you.<br />
<br />
Holy Cake--+5 saves on Fire, Cold, Magic, DIS and Poisen. <br />
<br />
Some less common stat bonus foods (PoP subcomponents make these more expensive):<br />
<br />
Mephit Meat Pie: Hp+30, +5 to STA, Fie, Cold, DIS, Magic, Poisen.<br />
<br />
bucket of crab legs: HP+40, Mana +40 (sigh), +5 to Fire, DIS, Cold.<br />
<br />
There are lots of other stat bonus foods out there too; look around.<br />
<br />
Fairly common stat bonus drinks:<br />
<br />
Grobb Liquidised meat: STR+6, STA+6, WIS -1, INT-1<br />
<br />
Qeynos Afternoon Tea: +5 to DEX, WIS, INT, and AGI<br />
<br />
Kaladim Constitutional: +5 to STA, FIRE, DIS, COLD, MAGIC, POISEN.<br />
<br />
You probably know how to use this stuff, but in case anyone doesn't:<br />
Stat bonus food and drink (made by players) gives you the bonuses whenever it is the top food/drink you are carrying.<br />
If you eat/drink the stat bonus stuff, it goes away and you have no more bonus (SO DON&quot;T EAT IT).<br />
You can slow or even stop the rate you eat stat bonus food/drink in two ways:<br />
1. Put regular food/drink in an inventory slot above your stat food/drink (you won't get the bonuses, but you won't eat your stat food while shopping in the bazaar, either).<br />
2. Force-feeding yourself cheap non-stat food/drink. To do that, pick up one (say, water flask) put it in an inventory slot, and right click on it. When you can't eat/drink any more you'll get a message that says you would explode if you tried to eat or drink anymore. Until you get hungry/thirsty again, you won't consume any of the stat food/drink, even if it's in your top food/drink slots. You will get the bonuses, however.</div></div><hr />
