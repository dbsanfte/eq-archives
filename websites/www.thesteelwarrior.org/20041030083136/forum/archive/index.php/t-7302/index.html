<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ibithor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, I just unlocked tak armor and chose the boots to replace my kingly boots of slendor sicne it was a good raw 20ac and other minor stats and the ability to upgrade them further. I have loked at diff augs and i think what i want to go with are the following<br />
<br />
slot1 - 5fr 5cr 5 mr aug from tak<br />
slot2- 30hp aug from guk<br />
slot3 - 40 hp aug from mistmoore<br />
<br />
can i do this combination? i dont have all the augs unlocked yet so all i am going by is what i have seen on the web. can anyone think of a better aug to put in the slot3?<br />
<br />
also i wear a crinose cape of the werewolf and just won one of those 12 ac 70hp 70mana 70 end 7 to all save cloaks in ldon. should i lose the crinose for the new cape and aug it with a 10 dex aug or something? 10 hp 7 str 7 dex or whatever seems ok to lose for 70end and the saves if i can turn around and plop 10 dex on the cape. i know its kinda ass item to be auging but i dont forsee a better cloak soon. im not in a guild, altho i am looking for a raiding guild<br />
<br />
thanks in advance for any help or advice on my gear</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Omnus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">NO, the 40 hp aug and 30 hp aug are both type 2 only. And I believe the 40 hp aug is tak, and the 40 mana aug is MM</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My advice is not to aug the boots unless you already have good gear in your other slots.  I'd just put the trash augs from adventures in your boots and work on buying other pieces of tak armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ibithor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">my magelo is linked on the left, click it and tell me if im geared ok or not. thre arent many buyable upgrades left that i know of and fewer still that actually show up in bazaar on xev<br />
i know horn spike shoulders would be good but they are rare and like 180k last i saw a pair.  helm of rz or boc are also rarely in baz and both super expensive<br />
<br />
and oddly when i look at the 40 hp aug in YOUR magelo its says type 7, not type 2-and your premium magelo says its in yout type 1 slot<br />
i know for a fact 40hp is not tak, i have all the tak items unlocked and its not among them<br />
are you telling me wrong stuff on purpose or just dumb?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Estebar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You need to get the type 2 augment for the ldon boots.  (This will go into slot 2, which is type 2).  There are 3 different hp augments for &quot;regular&quot;, ldon bought, and time equipment (and they come from different camps).<br />
<br />
His magelo had a vex thal chest or something like that, so he had a (slot 1) type 7 (non-ldon bought, non-time) 40hp augment.  The type 2 40hp augment is probably ~1100 from mira or tak (I'll guess tak since people said that earlier).  I think it's type 8 for time stuff.<br />
<br />
<br />
What are you using for haste?  I don't seem to see any on your magelo.</div></div><hr />

Well, I was gonna do some simple research that you could have done for yourself.  Then I read this statement, way to be.  Good luck finding the info you need (not really).</div></div><hr />

You didn't look hard enough.<br />
The 40 hp type-2 augment is at Tak camp.<br />
The 40 hp type-7 augment is at Rujark camp.<br />
The 40 hp type-8 augment is at Mistmoore camp.<br />
<br />
The augment that you saw in Omnus's magelo was type-7 because he put it in a type-7 slot.<br />
<br />
The augment that you need for your boots is type-2 because your boots have a type-2 slot.<br />
<br />
You cannot purchase hp augments that go in your type-1 or type-3 slots.  You can find them as loot in Gates of Discord, though.</div></div><hr />
