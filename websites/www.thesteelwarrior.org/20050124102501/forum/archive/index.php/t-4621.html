<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Driggan</div><div class="date">12-06-2003, 06:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey everyone, this is my first post on the forum, and I am sort of hoping you could help with a little problem I have. It's kind of hard to explain unless I make a story, so skip to the bottom or don't read if you don't want to listen to my messed up story.<br />
<br />
For the past few weeks of playing I have been having loads of fun with my warrior iksar, even though he wasn't really doing that well. I'm kinda new to EQ and the iksar was my first character, so I obviously didn't know much about the game, but I thought I should have been a bit smarter than to do the mistake I did... <br />
<br />
On the Prexus server I managed to get up to level 27 using mostly 2 handed swords after I was able to buy a darkedge from the bazaar for cheap. I was leveling up in Highkeep after I managed to run into the zone with a difficulty that was ehh..... (being an iksar and all). After I got a bind there and leveled a bit I had to visit the bazaar, afterwards I had to get a way home so I asked around and a druid said he could get me to East Karana from which I could run to Highkeep. Being the stupid noob I was, I joined the group and got whisked away to a druid circle.... where I was brought down to 50% by 3 druids.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what happened next, but I see him casting it again and end up in the middle of that one druid/ranger town, Everglade or something and was hit for 500 damage, instantly killing me. Never saw the druid who ported me again. I managed to get my corpse to the exit with a newly made ranger and got it with my character..... Then made another dumb decision and left immediately, the guards at the exit followed me through the Qeynos hills and killed me.<br />
<br />
Here I was stuck with a problem.... I was supposed to leave the next day in the evening for a vacation. I thought that if I had died I would have been able to get the corpse..... but nobody around me was willing to port, at least without donations (I was broke). I couldn't run out because I had gotten help to get into the cellars in the first place, and with no armor / weapons I was doomed to never be able to make it out. So I left on my week-long vacation and the corpse rotted.<br />
<br />
So here I am, broke and naked in the cellar of highkeep surrounded by people who's rate of friendliness mostly depended on how much money you were willing to give and how strong you were in their group. There is the whole story of how I am a stupid noob.<br />
<br />
I'm doing this to see if anyone else has ever had this problem and was wondering if there was any decent way to get some money fast for an iksar warrior, I'm new to the game so I don't know how to get money easily. If you think I should just make a new character and start over that's ok too... but I think it will still be a warrior because they are the most fun to me :cool: .</div></div><hr />

Some people are just assholes, sorry about all that.  Never trust a Druid, or even a pink skin for that matter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Driggan</div><div class="date">12-06-2003, 07:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe :) , I'll try to remember that. My entire equipment I don't think cost more than 500-550 plat (At least, at the prices that I got them).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darkoan</div><div class="date">12-06-2003, 07:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Shit man, hopefully a Warlord/Overlord on Prexus can throw you some plat.  If you were on Seventh Hammer I'd toss ya 5k in an instant.  <br />
<br />
Mid level Warrior loyalist needs some help here guys, Prexus represent!</div></div><hr />

i remember what it was like back then to get money</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zynth</div><div class="date">12-07-2003, 01:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">sometimes i wish there were lowbies on stormhammer, my bank is over flowing with junk i know i'm not going to use, me being a packrat and all. on my home server i ususally just went to the local newbie zone and gave stuff away to who ever looked the least twinked, or a fellow iksar warrior. i always have stuff for a lowbie iksar warrior :D<br />
<br />
*edit* grammer =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anker steadfast</div><div class="date">12-07-2003, 11:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Go beat up a skeleton in a newbie area to get a rusty 2H weapon.<br />
<br />
Then go and smash up some Bandits in Paludal Cavern (with a group would be cool), you can tank them fairly well, even naked and they drop ringmail type armor. Heck, you might even get a tiny sliver of exp, though most should be green to you.<br />
<br />
Also, sometimes they drop 2-3 pp and some other sellables, so loot up a storm.<br />
<br />
Buy a better 2H in the Bazaar ASAP offcourse.<br />
I must admit to not knowing what is good at that low levels, waaaay back in the days when I was at that level I used a Langseax of the Wolves ... which is a pitiful sword by todays standards - But hey, that was pre-Kunark.<br />
<br />
And if you feel like buggering people, try and ask someone in POK (if you have planes of power expansion) or Cabilis to buy you a full suit of Leather armor on behalf of you having lost your corpse. Since leather pieces are only 2-4 pp a piece, someone are likely to help you get restarted.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit :<br />
Oh, and if you ask people for help on getting some leather armor, make sure to find the leather armor merchant before asking .. one thing is asking for their plat, another is asking for them to spend time on finding the merchant.<br />
<br />
Also, when in Bazaar, use the 2H slash filter in &quot;Type&quot; and limit the Platinium range to be searched on. When the search pops up, sort by prize and start looking at the lower end of the range, check all the list and see what is the best bang for the buck.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kintor</div><div class="date">12-07-2003, 07:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">way more than a legit 27 warrior can make on his own, he did offer the leftover plat back though which tells me i did good,</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">carlelius</div><div class="date">12-10-2003, 01:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is cool to see people that will actually give a helping hand. I am perpetualy broke cuz of always giving stuff away. But it pays off in the long run. A lot of times kindness will take you far in ths game.<br />
<br />
I remember being a total newb and this ranger comes from nowhere and gives me a wakizashi of the frozen skies and a venomous axe of the velium brood. His only concern was for me to pass them along when I grew out of them. I hope those things are still floating around to some newb and not some bazaar junk now.<br />
<br />
Peace.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wudedorm</div><div class="date">12-10-2003, 03:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">nice Kintor, and doing things like that pay off imo.<br />
I still have people come up to me and go remember me? you helped me with XXX or gave me XXX, just wanted to say thanks.<br />
After being away from home server for 2 years that makes you feel good.<br />
So if you have spare stuff go find a true newbie, you know you can tell...and give em a hand, it will make you feel good later.</div></div><hr />
