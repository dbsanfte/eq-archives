<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GSW</div><div class="date">09-01-2003, 03:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was just thinking about something...what does a warrior need to do to be classified as a &quot;good&quot; warrior? Well, a good warrior knows his opponents, knows methods of getting aggro, pays attention, and knows how to use that taunt key properly, not like some paladin, etc. Well, to us warriors anyway.<br />
<br />
But in the end it really comes down to how the group or raid works together, and the warriors equipment. Think about it. In a regular group a warrior just has to tank(or pull also), and that mostly depends on the group making sure the aggro stays on the warrior, the warriors weapons, and his hp, ac, and AAs. <br />
<br />
Let's assume the warriors knows how to taunt, uses shield on the casters, has AE taunt, always uses kick/slam and disarm, and uses a gsot. If there is a monk with a really high DPS weapon pushing out insane DPS and doesn't bother to FD or stay at max range, the warrior can't do much to keep aggro. An overnuking wizzy will mess things up too. We can only taunt once every 6 seconds, and casters landing high aggro spells more often then that will surely get them beat up. And besides, taunt doesn't always work! There's more things a group can do to keep aggro on a warrior then a warrior can do to keep aggro. <br />
Oh, by the way, let's say the warrior has a very good weapon, a BoC for example. Not only a warrior with that will do more DPS then one with an average weapon, 1 EB proc will keep him on top of the aggro list for quite a while even with a bad group.<br />
<br />
And is it the warriors fault he takes more damage then another? One may be in a guild who's raiding the elementals, walking around with his 7k unbuffed hp, 200 AA, and a BoW, another may be in a family type guild that has just defeated Vindi, with 4k unbuffed hp, 30 AA, and a gsot. So, one will require a cleric healer in PoV and a good number of heals, possibly a med break once in a while, and the other can easily do with a shammy healer in the same place, and the shammy won't break a sweat healing him. So, because one warrior is in a good raiding guild and the other is in a low end family type guild, one is &quot;better&quot; then the other? Assuming both know how to play their class well. <br />
<br />
And on a raid when main tanking some big mob, there's very little for the warrior to do in many cases. Heck, look at IV in akheva! The MT just has to get positioned correctly and then he has to tank blind for 10 minutes. Sure, in some fights the warrior has to actually do something, but most of the time the warriors job is very simple, and how well he tanks is only determined by his hp and the CH chain. <br />
<br />
So...to a smart warrior, a good warrior is one that plays his class well...but to everyone else, a good warrior is just one who has good gear. Heck, some people don't even care if someone is ebayed. A friend of mine was telling me that he met this great tank, he's an SK and has over 9k hp(buffed) and stuff, elemental gear. I told him he's ebayed(and he is), and he said he's still a great tank because he still did good DPS and took far less damage then others(only thanks to his gear). I was really not happy to hear that. <br />
<br />
ok...i'm done ranting, for now. Tell me what ya think, or flame away :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frodlin7th</div><div class="date">09-02-2003, 01:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's a lot of things a &quot;good&quot; warrior does to differentiate himself or herself from average warriors that isn't related to gear.<br />
<br />
1. Is the warrior conscientious as to the positioning of mobs to give others a clear shot at the mob's back?<br />
<br />
2. On multiple undead pulls (high proximity aggro), does the warrior position himself or herself such that he or she is the one taking the majority of the beating from uncontrolled mobs.<br />
<br />
3. If 3 mobs are mezzed, one just dies, and 2 are active, does the warrior hi f8 and break mez, or oes he actively seek the live ones?<br />
<br />
4. Does the warrior use /shield?   (This is the one thing that will differentiate you from crappy warriors easier than anything else)<br />
<br />
5. On splitting mobs, does the warrior try to control the initial split via use of Rampage or AE taunt, or does he just pick a target and let the chips fall as they may?<br />
<br />
6. Is the warrior prepared in advance with arrows or other range attack items?<br />
<br />
7. Does the warrior have a knowledge of how to get from point A to point B without assistance?   Does he or she carry with them appropriate potions (Invis/Gate/etc) to not burden the group?<br />
<br />
8. Does the warrior have a variety of utility type weapons to compensate for a linkdeath of a party member, or the lack of a specific class?   (Any warrior with a Journeyman's Walking stick is better than one without, and it's not about 'l33t raid gear, they run 400pp in the bazaar).   Warriors with a variety of procs are of greater value than those without, get them.   At a minimum, a journeyman's walking stick, a silken whip of ensnaring, and a wavecrasher will make you more valuable than the next guy.   <br />
<br />
9. A warrior who is impatient (I'm bad at this) turns people off who have better alternatives to the warrior.<br />
<br />
10.  You exude your level of self-confidence.   If you think you're badass, others will likely agree.  If you think you're a pud, others will likely agree.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On another note, if you have multiple mezzed mobs in camp, and you can pick out the one the chanter mezzed first (IE : the one that mez will wear off first), then you're really kicking ass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GSW</div><div class="date">09-02-2003, 07:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Definetely some nice tips there, a good warrior does those things and more. But in combat the 2 *main* things are keeping aggro and taking damage. Assuming 2 warriors know how to use taunt, shield, discs, and stay close to the mob, one with better gear will be considered better by most people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draganetti</div><div class="date">09-02-2003, 07:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've seen many &quot;bad&quot; well-equipped warriors.  I've also seen many &quot;good&quot; underequipped warriors.  If you are playing with good people, they will understand the differences too.  <br />
<br />
Being a &quot;good&quot; warrior is the same as being good at any other class: you have to be aware of the game-world around you and how it works, and you have to be focused.  &quot;Good&quot; warriors also know how to seek out the best equipment in their ability range that will help them to do their job.  Beyond that, it just comes down to who logs more hours into eq to accomplish those goals.</div></div><hr />

Pets are decent dps but crappy tanks , ya need to keep an eye on what there doing too. Many times healers dont heal pets so a simple step or 2 over can save 60+ dps for your group instead of a mob killing the pet and turning on casters. <br />

Just a helpful hint<br />

<br />
Doesn't matter how good you are if the cleric doesn't feel like healing you, your dead anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GSW</div><div class="date">09-03-2003, 05:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Especially on raids. Aside from the obvious, such as positioning, a warrior just stands there and takes the beating, in most cases. The only things that matter are him keeping aggro and having enough hp and defensive abilities to stay alive as the CH chain heals him. Heck, if a warrior has can't take as much beating as another(gear, AAs), they just make the CH chain faster. <br />
<br />
I've tanked a good number of things, and at times i've received tells saying nice job of great tanking. Sure, it feels great tanking some big mob, everyone healing you and you being the center of everything, and receiving nice tells afterwards sometimes. But in reality i didn't do anything more then a pally! All it was is gear and AAs to keep aggro and keep me alive. Heck, any cleric in a CH chain does more work then the MT in most encounters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Uira Tawhaki</div><div class="date">09-03-2003, 06:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">uses shield on the casters<br />
Can I just second this... One of the only things I have noticed that a lot of warriors fail to do is use shield. Shield increases total mob damage by 25% so some warriors believe that it's worthless. That's simply not true, however, because the slower/CC'er has no where near the damage mitigation or HP pool we do. /shield saves the slower/CCer and prevents wipes. It also makes the aggro issue *somewhat* less important because even an unruned enchanter can take a few 200 point hits, but a few 400 point hits would certainly kill them.<br />
<br />
You may have to explain /shield to your slower because one thing I've noticed a lot of slowers fail to do is stand still! Too many of them run around like chickens with their heads cut off while the mob backstabs them and you get &quot;You cannot see your target&quot; &quot;Your target is out of range&quot; messages.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tarean</div><div class="date">09-04-2003, 01:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">To me, a good warrior is the kind that helps himself. As far as utility and traveling go, warriors are pretty much helpless. If a warrior is constantly begging for this or that to get around it just shows a lack of effort. Any warrior to lazy to buy invis potions, carry batwings+potions, sow potions/horse, and perhaps carry around some utility weapons is quite worthless. <br />
<br />
Another thing is experience. Not just your yellow bar but how long you've played your warrior. Everything tankly will come to you just by doing it, not asking here. <br />
<br />
Gear is also important, as is aa. So I feel for the up and coming players that are very skilled but so far behind they can't catch up. Sadly those people will not be considerd good tanks because of lacking gear. Then again, that fixes itself with time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
my bag of tricks is small; but the tricks i got i know how to use and when i use them it's often some pretty damn good results.<br />
<br />
it's all i  got. i don't b!tch about it. hell i'm nearly 65; almost elemental level; and i don't even own an EB item. i'm there to keep people alive. so what if all i do is contribute some DPS here and there. If i keep 10+ casters alive during a raid because of /sheild; i just shaved time off the entire encounter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Klomck</div><div class="date">09-04-2003, 10:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I consider myself a &quot;good&quot; warrior, based on my playing ability and dedication to my Guild team. My gear is second-rate at best, but I, like most players, am working on it as I can. Warriors are the-most-dependant-on-gear class in the game, period. <br />
As far as raid tank just standing there taking a beating...<br />
On the big mob encounter, that's a big part of it, but watching positioning, knowing who has aggro (as to not waste taunt on a ranger who should have known better when you may need it for a cleric before it would have recycled) watching the time on your /disc, and a myriad of other things are important too. <br />
the travel to the big mob, at least for me, has me one of the hardest working toons in the raid, as my raid leader usually makes me MA as well as MT. constant communication with the enchanters as well as other key people can keep one pretty busy. <br />
<br />
to answer &quot;what makes a good warrior?&quot;<br />
practice, patience, dedication, and awareness.<br />

Since it was mentioned earlier in this thread;<br />
I currently carry in ye ol' rallic pack;<br />

glowing black sword (basically to &quot;unsnare&quot; myself in duels if i can)<br />
<br />
I saw the wavecrasher meantioned and realized I am remiss for not carrying a slow-ing weapon... <br />
my question is, are there any other warrior weapons with a slow proc? wavecrasher i believe is 35%, so what im asking about are weapons with that or better. <br />
<br />
tks in advance for not referring me to the library or the other forum ( i will probably post the question there as well if i dont get a reply here )</div></div><hr />

<br />
A knowledge of the capabilities and quirks of other classes. I reckon a good warrior has to know what is gonna come out of the woodwork when he is grouped with any class. Most classes will have some ability that is a huge aggro generator (simple one, Bard Mez = HUGE aggro IMO).<br />
<br />
The warrior has to be aware of this and know when and where to pick his mob, taunt at the right time. Use shield when the caster deserves it (I like shield, but sorry, if someone overnukes they can have a few hits, maybe they'll learn their lesson. p.s. chanters always get /shield, they give me haste after all :p)<br />

Oh, IIRC you reduce the amount of damage you take from shielding by having a shield. Shaves off the extra 25% after a certain AC.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With a 3 min refresh shield is a tough one to use on all groupmembers. IMO you preserve the ones that could cause a wipe. That means CC'er, slower and healer (in that order - see explanation inc). As far as the DPS go.. I wouldn't bother. You might need shield on the next pull to protect one of the key roles. If a DPS'er falls, they can get a rez and be up and medding while the group continues to pull. If a primary buffer or someone with a vital role dies the wait time is what costs everyone xp.<br />
<br />
So why the slower before the healer?<br />
<br />
IMO since the slower/CC'er is far more likely to draw aggro then the healer, the primary /shield key gets their name attached to it (locked to the up arrow key on my macro set). The secondary /shield key gets the healer's name attached but, really, your ENC/SHM should be watching that healer to make sure they don't die. If a healer dies while I'm on my ENC, I kick myself. If that happens, it means I missed a chance to mez a mob or tash off aggro.<br />
<br />
Healers get aggro due to a few spells with long casting times. Most of their other spells don't generate much hate. ENC (and I believe SHM) on the other hand can draw aggro very quickly if and when they choose. They can also CC (root works in place of mez if needed). If the warrior shields me, as an ENC, I can tash the mob off a cleric in less than 2 seconds and /shield is still used effectively. A cleric couldn't do the same in reverse.<br />
<br />
[As a side note and on the topic of knowing other classes quirks: a druid could steal aggro off a slower, but knowing the personality types of most druids (most not all) they never would. In my experience most druids are players who like to solo (independence), don't like to die and are therefore prone to running/evac'ing. They avoid aggro like the plague and would never intentionally take it off of someone else. That's just a stereotype, I know, but it's not often I find one who proves me wrong on this point. Even in situations where there have been multiple adds and a simple snare kite for 10 seconds would have saved the whole group from a wipe I've seen them gate or try to evac instead. I think it's just a matter of practice.]</div></div><hr />

As to Uira's comment on druids, I tend to agree. It's hard to find a druid who is well skilled in group tactics. My play partner is one and she just applied to a top tier guild on my server, so I don't play with her as much now.  Having a druid in the group who knows how to move into the roll as healer, or crowd control, or nuker, etc, makes a group much more effective. And having any caster who knows to call for help and stand still, or to come to me when getting attacked is priceless.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh by the way...i should probably mention that i was not asking what a good warrior is, i was trying to make my points that gear and AAs are at least 80% of what makes a good warrior to other people. Sure, a warrior who carries a ToD can slow, not very well, but at least it's something. It helps, but how often do you really use your slowing weapon? And carrying potions and such helps, but it's not hard for some bored wizzy to run down and get ya. Besides, all good players, not just warriors, should carry utility weapons and equipment and such. But it doesn't change whether you need almost chain healing in an exp group, or need about 1 heal per fight. <br />
<br />
Sure, there are many minor things a warrior can do to be &quot;better&quot;, but between 2 warriors who do the basic tasks well(positioning, taunts, discs, shielding), gear and AAs is what determines how &quot;good&quot; they are to everyone else. What do people seek in a warrior? Keeping aggro, taking a beating. There are other things, but these are the most important jobs and that's what people need from us. And if a warrior can't take a good beating because he doesn't have the hp, he's a &quot;bad&quot; warrior as far as most people see. And if a warrior doesn't keep aggro, lots of people think he's not taunting, and some of them don't even know what taunt does. But perhaps the group isn't helping him keep aggro or he doesn't have good proccing weapons? <br />
<br />
When you say &quot;uber warrior&quot;, what makes him so uber? Well uhh...he has uber weapons and armor. Have you ever seen a warrior with poor gear called uber for carrying invis potions? :P<br />
<br />
Oh, by the way, i'm not an uber warrior. I'm not a bad warrior. I have 5400 unbuffed hp, 76 AA, and use copper hammer and red blade. I have been in a family guild for a long time, and have recently joined a raiding guild. I don't have any &quot;uber&quot; raid loot(not can't get, just don't have atm), in fact all of my gear was quested, purchased, or looted off a relatively easy mob. I have no trouble tanking and keeping aggro with an average pickup group. I carry potions, ToD, snare whip, use taunt, shields, and discs when necessary, etc etc etc. And i don't like pallys.<br />
<br />
The reason i posted this is because i wanted to share my thoughts on the warrior class. We depent on gear, that's all there is to it. Other things matter, but not nearly as much as this.<br />
I'm not talking about warriors who don't pay attention to the screen and don't taunt, etc. They don't even deserve to be called warriors. <br />
<br />
By the way, those warriors in the elementals who have been playing for 3 years often post or talk about how new warriors these days can't keep aggro and give warriors a bad name, and about how a good warrior can keep aggro with any weapon, and similar things. Well, do this. Put down the BoW and put on the gear you used in velious era(excluding BoC). Oh the armor too. Now go to a 3rd tier zone and group with a bunch of random people, with gear similar to what you're wearing. Having fun?<br />
<br />
Oh, you think that people with velious gear should be grouping in velious? Well, see the problem is...the game today makes the only way to go is to level up to 65. There's few low level people, most are high level, all the updates and such focus on high level things. That's why there's so many people who don't know how to play their class and don't have very good gear these days. Don't blame them, blame the game. The last thing i wanna do is take my 35 cleric alt to the Dreadlands...Dreadlands is a perfect name for such a dreadful zone, it provides &quot;easy&quot; exp blasting people from 40 to 50(well, it's probably lower now, i've even seen people under 50 exping in PoJ! UGGHH!) without having fun or learning important things. But i'm afraid i won't have a choice, friends who play alts will probably bring them to DL, and DL is one of the only zones where a mid level character can easily get a group and find many other people of their level. <br />
<br />
But anyway, i went too far off topic...i'm done for now.<br />
<br />
edit:<br />

Ok, i'm not done...You have all mentioned many excellent things, but some are very minor things, and don't change the fact that people look for lots of hp and aggro in a warrior. Others are things a good *player* does. <br />
<br />
Done...seriosly, i am.</div></div><hr />

Ok, so me and guild shaman have a running game on who slows BoT named first without getting creamed... Still fun to call out &quot;SLOWED %t&quot; before they do and tell them they are now useless since mob mitigates slow about 50% or so, hehe.<br />

Back on Topic: A good warrior knows his role and plays to their fullest. An 'uber' warrior has high-end raid gear. Uber equipment doesn't mean you are good, though I would have to say most people with the topshelf equipment have earned it ( the exception is Ebayed nutsacks ) .<br />
<br />
P.S. I'm certainly not uber, but for the most part I do my job with what i got and where I tank.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There's a rule in my groups/guild...don't thank me for buffs, it's my JOB.  It's really annoying breaking in the new guys who thank me every time i give them focus...stfu, I don't thank you for taunting.<br />
<br />
A good warrior shares food and drink when others are out. <br />
<br />
Pff, anyone who says they're out of food or drink should be laughed outta the zone.  There is zero excuse for that these days.  Back in the day when you started with 5 bread cakes and 5 milks you MIGHT have been able to make a case that the rats you were killing didn't drop enough coin to afford food, but that's not gonna fly with me today.</div></div><hr />

If it wasn't for the druids foraging eternity food/drink, I'd be out of BBPP by now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i am a lvl 53 warrior in a family guild and don't have the &quot;ubar&quot; gear but i know my job and have a few weapons in my bag: Wavecrasher, spiked velium mallet, lammy, JBoM, and a weighty polearm. i don't have any skill in 2hb or piercing really because this was my first character and is the rishest with a whole 350pp in the bank atm :P i DO have 1hs 2hs and 1hb maxed and over 100ac and 2300hp with 20% haste on the neck slot but pickedup a Belt of Contention on the last PoA raid.<br />
<br />
<br />
clerics love me and pallies and SKs hate me, good agro weapons lol. i can even hold agro grouped with monks and  as long as i have HoS on me they rarely have to FD:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vigdis SangCaru</div><div class="date">09-08-2003, 04:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In my experience, the level of &quot;goodness&quot; of the warrior is often directly dependent on the level of &quot;goodness&quot; of the group. <br />
<br />
I believe myself to be a pretty good warrior.  I know about position, I know about timing, I know about my abilities, my pros and my cons, and I've botted just about every class so I'm aware of what other classes want out of their tank.  And if I'm with a good group, its half orgasmic.  But lately I've really been grinding and so I go outside the guild and outside my friends and look for pick-up groups /groan.  Most are good groups, but boy do some of the groups suck.  And when the group sucks I always end up thinking that _I'm_ sucking because the first thing that happens is inevitable ping pong. <br />
<br />
The more I pick-up group, the less happy I feel with my class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GSW</div><div class="date">09-08-2003, 05:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good point, Vigdis. If the people you're playing with don't know how to manage aggro well, the warrior could be blamed. The dumbest thing people say is the warrior was not taunting, even though they don't even know what taunt is. <br />
<br />
By the way, i just got a BoC on the last AoW kill! :)<br />
And i gotta say, the aggro BoC generates was crazy. I use epic for offhand and if either one procs before slow, i'm set for the whole fight. The procs and nice DPS on BoC provides me with solid aggro after the slow(slow lands, taunt, mob back on me). Getting this weapon made it even more clear how gear dependent we are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abividad</div><div class="date">09-08-2003, 06:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I sooooo agree with that last statement Vigdis. After 59 levels of guild groups and duoing with g/f's Cleric, I broke down and started using LFG. Night and day from day to day in the same zone how some things went. First trip to PoV castle at 60 went very well, had a great group, I was able to do my job much better than I anticipated since I went in expecting the worst. Was taking a CH and an elixir after fight per mob. A week later I'm in another pick-up group and was taking between 2-3 CHs a mob, Lost the Enchanter slower 2x and Cleric actually had to stop and med after several kills. I felt so gimp I apologized to the Cleric even though I could see where the other classes were treating me like an agro-lock Pally and just letting rip. Then next group was a constant pullfest again and all went smoothly. A bad group can really make you feel like you're a rusty longsword in a world of SoDs</div></div><hr />

<br />
Of course I don't thank folks in the middle of a raid for things we are all doing to get ready. I'd be thanking the dozen (ok 6) folks buffing us up and so would everyone else. But throwing it in group everyone once in a while is a good thing and it comes back to ya. <br />
<br />
Same with sharing the food. What does it cost? not much.. I got the extra str to carry it, no biggie. <br />
<br />
But those small things, make a difference.  <br />
<br />
Does being the guy who always has stuff if you are out make you a better warrior?  No, not really... but they do indicate teamwork and attention-to-detail... things that do make a good warrior.<br />
<br />
Kinda like timing kicks on casting mobs to interupt their casting. And all the little agro tricks we have to do to either hold or avoid agro depending on our role in the team.<br />

I started EQ late in the game (June 2001) and I immediately created a human warrior -- knowing almost nothing about the game.  <br />
<br />
I just wanted to say thanks to everyone in this thread, and in these forums.  I am little more than a casual player and I am unguilded.  I love my warrior, but often thought I was doing something wrong with my character.  Posts like the ones in this thread have really helped me to try to enjoy the challenge that is the warrior.  In a masochistic way I am proud that I haven't broken down and created a semi-twinked Vah Shir Beastlord yet.<br />
<br />
I apologize for the hijack, but just wanted to make sure everyone knew they have really helped me try to use the tricks of the warrior trade to help give warriors a better name.  This advice really helps me enjoy the game, rather than the advice I usually get from friends who have played EQ a long time: &quot;Use your warrior gear to twink out a pally.&quot; :mad:</div></div><hr />

- A good Warrior dies when he pulls more mobs than his group can handle, instead of running back to his mates screaming and wiping the group.</div></div><hr />

I've learned quite a bit on these boards re: my class that I hope have made me a better Warrior. I'm not giving up, tho, and I'm DEFINITELY not rolling over for SOE's 'paladin craze'.<br />
<br />
 Anyways, thanks to ya'll for all the tips and tricks.</div></div><hr />
