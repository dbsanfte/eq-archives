<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Moorgard used to be quite the voice for Mobhunter (http://www.mobhunter.com/index.jsp). He is now going to work for SOE as a community relations manager for EQ2. The article is here. (http://www.mobhunter.com/article.jsp?articleid=-1455192782) <br />
<br />
Discuss.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Coray</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm patiently awaiting word from Sony on what they're going to do to replace my puller, er stunt double now that they've stolen him.<br />
<br />
I personally have not kept great track of EQ2 so far, and people need to remember that the game already exists so he's not going to be able to come in and fix it all up if its crappy, or make it crappy if it's sweet.<br />
<br />
I do believe however that EQ2 is better off with Moorgard around, and I'm interested to see what he does with his post.<br />
<br />
Plus, I get to be his arch nemesis now, which makes this all the more sweet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, i hope for his peace of mind and enjoyment of life they do a better job of implementing the stuff that needs doing in EQ 2 than 1. <br />
<br />
He's the mouthpiece of the players I doubt he'll have much more say in the games' development than via offering 'advice' from the playerbase - that they are totally free to ignore.</div></div><hr />
