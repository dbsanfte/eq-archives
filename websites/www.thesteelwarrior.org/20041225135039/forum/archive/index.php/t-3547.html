This would be fucking fantastic if time gear was slot 7 also but its not, its slot 8.  There is now noway to upgrade hps on time gear other than shit raid drops.  Wtg and think it through, can i get a refund from this useless expansion?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Gonna be fixed next patch.  It's just not logical to leave it that way.<br />
<br />
Btw, anyone got a list of good new augment? I heard of vegeance 4 augment that go into slot 7 or 8 or something like that? What equipement slot? etc.<br />
<br />

<br />
The vengeance 4 augment is type 7 only it seem, hopefully it's possible to get a type 8 similar to this somewhere.<br />

<br />
               The only slot 8 on vendors atm are clones of procs ( lifetap, anger, 150dd etc ) and 40hp, 40 mana, 20HP/mana, 10ac.<br />
<br />
               The new focus effects/vengeance/FT/regen are only on type 7. We get to do ultra hard raids to get almost the same 8p</div></div><hr />

<br />
I could be wrong, but we may find that you're getting augs with double the stats there. Think of it as sort of a way to reward you for your time gear and still make you work for the the reward?</div></div><hr />

<br />
there are also aob and veng 4 type 7 augs so you can add useful effects to existing gear</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Besrikarle</div><div class="date">10-09-2003, 08:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As of our update on October 9th, the Solid Coal of Prowess, Blook Ruby of Understanding, and Ooze-Covered Pebble of Perfection will no longer be valid augmentations.  If you had these augmentations bonded to an item, you will find them on your cursor.  You can take those items to Dible Hedledrap in South Ro and he will restore your adventure points.<br />
<br />
IMPORTANT NOTE:  You MUST have some open inventory space to hold these items!  Also, if you zone with those items on your cursor, they will disappear.  So when you log in before the update, make sure you have some free space in your inventory.  And when you log in after the update, make certain to get those items off your cursor and into your inventory.<br />
<br />
This change is happening due to an issue with some of the new LDoN items.  These three augmentations will be replaced with three similar augmentations that fit into slot 7 or 8.  Along with that, pre-LDoN items that were given slot type 1 will now have slot type 7.<br />
<br />
Essentially, this will mean no change for those with these augmentations in their pre-LDoN items.  It will, however, restrict the use of multiples of these augmentations on LDoN items.  We apologize for the changes, but these items needed to be more restricted to help maintain game balance.<br />

Whats the problem?</div></div><hr />

Means I have a good 700 points invested in that camp, that are now utterly wasted, since it's sold in Miragul dungeon now.</div></div><hr />

Whats the problem?  <br />
<br />
The fact that i did ec to get 40 hp augs and they change them to mir, but hey gotta feel bad for the people who bought a tak bp thinking it was too good to be true, because it was =p.</div></div><hr />

Not sure why you people are complaing about a 40hp augment.. Considering that Anger3 comes from there...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wilhelmm_Lanys</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 01:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">EC has basically nothing of value now. I'm lucky I only have like 700 there. I can imagine people that have already bought the fucking augs that have 3k+ of useless adventure points now. As someone mentioned, Anger III doesn't work on BoW, so really it's useless.<br />
<br />
<br />
Fucking SoE, if they were gonna pull this shit, at least they could have given people the opportunity to transfer their adv. points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 01:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The adventure points aren't useless, you can still spend them wherever you want.  You just have to do enough adventures in the other zones to see the stuff you want to buy.<br />
<br />
I imagine you'll eventually want at least 1k points in each zone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Basically, it do work on Blade of War, you just saw the wrong augment.<br />
<br />
AFAIK, there is a type 7/8 augment for everything like the atk/hp/proc augments.  We will see how it turn out after they repatch thought.<br />

<br />
You need to pause for a moment.<br />
<br />
Actually log into EQ,Earn enough points to see these items for yourself,THEN come here and start complaing about them.<br />
<br />
As of yesterday ,Yes you can augment a non time 2 hander Via the Anger 3 Augment available in Everfrost.It has been labeled primarty secondary rather than one handed weapons only,and can in fact go on type 4 2 handers.<br />
<br />
<br />
You have already posted myriad of in accurate information you have clearly gathered from poor word of mouth and/or old information.<br />
<br />
As I stated at the begining of the post,Stop making assumptions based on what people tell you.<br />
<br />
It makes you look like a dip shit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aspit</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 02:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i bet the anger 3 you saw was slot 8~  The other anger is sold in mir and atm i dont have enough points to check it out so i gotta find someone to link me the item and ill let you know if it was changed, but i doubt it.  Also it may just be me but it seems like force of ykesha has a much higher proc rate than it did prepatch.<br />
<br />
anger 2 is 2h useable slot 4, havent found anger 3 yet but i assume that was changed with patch too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Surlok</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 02:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No the anger that I have on my boc is slot 4,it is from mirgs,and when I gather enough points again I will be putting it on my sews.</div></div><hr />

Is there an Anger3 aug thats for Slot 8? May have to finally hit some adventures..</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Anger 3 for type 4 weapons can be found in everfrost.The cost is 1150.<br />
<br />
I do not know the cost of the Augment in MM but do know that the name is the same as the Everfrost one save for the word &quot;Radiant&quot; at the begining of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sythrak</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 06:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There might be some confusion due to the patch last night.  As of right now there is a type 8 all weapons Anger 3 in South Ro for 1150 points.  Radiant Marble Sphere of Ire.<br />
<br />
I don't have the points to check EF so maybe its there too, but I don't think so.  I believe EF only has Anger 2 now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jateki</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 09:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's what I've found so far:<br />
 <br />
Type 7 40hp Augments are in EC for 1150<br />
Type 8 40hp Augments are in EF for 1150<br />
<br />
Type 4 Rujarkian Bile (125dd) augments are in EC for 510<br />
Type 8 Rujarkian Venon (150dd) augments are in EC for 760<br />
<br />
Type 8 Anger2 Augments are in BB for 510<br />
Type 4 Anger2 Augments are in EF for 510<br />
<br />
Type 8 Anger3 Augments are in Sro for 1150<br />
Type 4 Anger3 Augments are in EF for 1150<br />
<br />
None of the Anger Aug's are lore so you can have more than one. They can go a 2hs now np because they removed the restriction. <br />
<br />
I added the Anger2 Aug from BB to my darkblade and played with it for 2 adventures. It seems to proc nearly as much as much as the normal Anger proc and I love it so far. People will should be really happy adding these augs to their BoW or SEWS as well.<br />
<br />
Here's a screenshot of some post patch stuff I was looking at.<br />
http://members.cox.net/kateki/postpatch.jpg</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">10-11-2003, 01:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You all need to check the cheaper priced augments too.<br />
<br />
I saw a V-3 I believe, type 8 augment. Might have been V-2. Either way, it was damn cheap compared to the comprable priced V augments for other slots, and I believe it was at NRo camp.<br />
<br />
I think the benefit of Type 8 is that the effects for them are cheaper than the effects for types 7, 4, 2 and 1.<br />
<br />
Anyways, happy hunting.</div></div><hr />
