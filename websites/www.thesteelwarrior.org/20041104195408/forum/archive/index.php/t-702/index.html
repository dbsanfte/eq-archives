<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gardack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Working on the earring of Veracity quest. Just finished earring 3 tonight after camping all 4 reports this weekend. I wanted to gather some info on the Praesertum leaders in SS before I drag my guildies there to kill them.<br />
<br />
From what I've read they always drop the shard which is good. And I have a general idea of strategy for how to kill them and where they banish you. Just curious to know how hard they hit, how many hp they have, how many people you usually use to kill them, and what their respawn time is. <br />
<br />
If I can do this with 2 groups and they only banish like every 30 seconds, that would be great. Call me lazy, but I'd rather not drag my friends to this shitty zone till I know what we're up against though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Heh, can I actually ask YOU a question ...<br />
<br />
The reports camp ... you did in a weekend?<br />
<br />
How much time were you at it?<br />
<br />
What was drop rate like? I mean, how many kills of those guys did it take to see a report?<br />
<br />
I've been wanting to nudge some friends towards doing this quest for awhile now.<br />
<br />
Just trying to get an idea of how bad a timesink it really is.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>kriegartorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i did the prae guys with 3 of my friends... we were playing 11 characters total and pulled him to where he banishes...<br />
<br />
after that they are a joke hit for around 500 and flurry.... not slowable, decent amount of hps but u can do it with 1 cleric..<br />
<br />
as for pulling him, i had my non kos mage coth the monk after he is pulled with adds towards the jail... he gets stuck on pathing back and stands in a corner for a while... have the monk use an invis potion after tagging him and he'll come solo... <br />
<br />
another way i hear u can kill them is having a pet tank and healing the pet because he doesnt banish pets...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gerald</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">They banish every 5-10 seconds... somewhere around there. We did them with about 3 groups for all 4 which I guess is overkill you could say. We had a wizard sitting in the jail cell TLing people back to their bind (we had everybody bind in the conference rooms outside the Praesertum rooms).<br />
<br />
I didn't think you could pull them out of the rooms though? I guess that would make them pretty damn trivial.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gardack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I got really lucky on the reports. Had a full group going between all 4 buildings killing the mobs for about 2 hours and got zero drops the first night. Then my fiance and I logged on our shaman / monk and started duoing the spawns. Got 1 report Friday night in an hour or so, 1 report Saturday in 1-2 hours, then 2 reports Sunday in under an hour.<br />
<br />
<br />
Will have to look into finding someone to pull the guys to the jail if we can. Otherwise will drag a couple mages / necros there and bind the melees as a last resort.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>-Kai-</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Umm...never heard of someone pulling it...even after reading...not sure thats possible.  <br />
<br />
Breakdown on shards/reports....u can get shoulder report on way to do seru himself...usually one drops.  Rest just wait and see if you get lucky while killing the leaders.  Leaders can be done with a very good mage or necro pet...plus other dps pets.   You can shoot arrows w/o agro while pets are on him....just have about 2 or 3 clerics to keep pets up.  I think one leader is unslowable so its pretty tough to keep pet up on him...think its the Barb Leader.   Leaders are 14 day spawns just like seru...so if seru is killed a lot on ur server...its gonna suck.  After u down the leader....check out what reports u have left and go kill in those buildings until u have it and then pray some ass hasnt killed Lcea in Katta.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mathas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">All the Praesertums con yellow at 65.  They all hit in the 500s, and proc a banish every 5-10 seconds, like Gerald said.  Matpa(heart) is an enchanter, and Bikun(shoulder) is unslowable.  That's really about the only differences between them that I could tell.  <br />
<br />
As far as how many hp they have... I think my HT dropped them about 4-5%, so very roughly 140-150khp, not counting regen.  Spawn time is one week on the dot, as far as I could tell.<br />
<br />
Easiest way is with a slower, 2-3 pet classes, and a cleric or two.  They won't banish pets, and a mage epic pet or a post-60 mage/necro/bl pet can easily tank them slowed. Two clerics kept a 62 mage air pet alive against the unslowable one, and were NOT strained on mana doing so.  The others are even easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sarelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">NPC's cannot banish pets. We killed those mobs repeatedly over the last few weeks using a Mage Pet as tank and any other pets that were available to add a bit of dps (even SK and Druid pets).<br />
<br />
Casters carefully nuke/dot so they don't get aggro.<br />
Other Melee try to use bows as and when the target is not wedged in the wall.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>aspit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">easiest way to kill them is get a bunch of dot classes and da rush preas...have everyone bind in the room and dot him to hell.  Youll all get banished pretty fast, just gate back rinse and repeat.  Its a good idea to have a cleric in the jail to heal also =p.<br />
