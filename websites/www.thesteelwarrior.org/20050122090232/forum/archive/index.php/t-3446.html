<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">10-06-2003, 12:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Poor 65 warrior in a post raiding guild... IE we have comepletely gone to peices and can't raid anything for a couple of months, at least. This would normally be a big problem, but, fortuantly LDoN is out and I can have fun and at least feel like I am getting somewhere there.<br />
<br />
On to the question, considering I am mostly in LDoN, what would server me best for agro and DPS? WMBS (just bought have not played with yet), GSoT (which I have and like and have little problem maintaining agro with) or CHoS and Bloodsworn? <br />
<br />
Considering the premium on DPS in LDoN...I think I am even willing to loose some agro for more DPS. And no I would not be saving up enouhg points to hate 3 aug the 1h weapons. Those would only  be placed into the buyable (from Adventure merchants) 14/19 or 15/20s, as it is likely to be a long time before I see another weapon upgrade. (Probably aug any weapons I do have with the 510 Ruj 125 poison proc.)</div></div><hr />

I'd suggest, even though you said you wouldnt really feel like saving up to aug both weps, get Yak on both CHoS and SotBS.. that would be a mean combo of aggro, and decent dps also.<br />
