<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ooka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am a 65 ogur warrior with about 50 AAs in a raiding guild (approx 3-4 times a week). I am MT about 10-20% of the time but hoping that percentage will increase.<br />
<br />
I have in my inventory (all without augments):<br />
Cord Hilted Spike Driver<br />
Stromrider Carapace (yes, I hear the groans)<br />
CHoS<br />
Fleshgrinder<br />
SotBS<br />
WMB<br />
GSoT<br />
<br />
Which weapons would you recommend I augment with what?<br />
For use as MT on raids?<br />
For use as MT on groups?<br />
For pure and simple DPS?<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance for your time and expertise!<br />
Ooka</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">pure and simple keep yourr WMBS un-augmented; or throw a lifetpa proc or some bullkrap on it....that thing does some nice DPS<br />
<br />
for augments; thro angerIII on you greatstaff of thunder for raids/groups...chances are slim to none anyone will pull aggro off you.<br />
<br />
at 65; witht he right aa's...your 2Hers will be your best best for DPS+aggro IMHO. worse case with idiots grouping a SotB/CHSD/CHoS combo will be more than sufficent as-is. sell fleshgrinder; you're grown past that now. use $$$ to buy upgrades is needed. it's a nice weapon but once heavy raiding you do gets to the upper PoP it's just not goign to cut the mustard</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>mazzarek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah, the 340 point lifetap aug in WMBS would be good, it'll add some dps and it can never hurt to tap.<br />
<br />
If I were you I'd put anger 3 in CHSD and a yak proc in CHoS.  You're probably fine dual-wield tanking whatever you're tanking.  And the yak proc will be fun when you decide to blow some AA on Ingenuity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Since you already have a Stormrider Carapace, go back and hit the towers some more and get yourself a Greatblade of Storms. Wield that with your CHSD for your tanking agro weapons. If you have a shot at better in the near future and don't want to blow a lot of points on augs, then get a couple of A2 augs until you upgrade. If these are the best you will see for a while, then go ahead and put A3 on them, you will not have agro problems with either set up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Then go back to the same tower as the Carapace and get yourself a Greatstaff of the Four Winds, and make it your DPS weapon (probably your last one before elementals).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>BabaHanz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'd suggest going with CHSD and SotB.  Don't bother with the CHoS or GBoS on raids, cause I know my guild bitches constantly about the knockback about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gront</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you're MTing, everyone's behind the mob, on the opposite side from you, and your push seems like it wouldn't matter.  If you're not MTing, you should be using a GSot4W instead of any dual-wield combo.  Why would you worry about aggro weapon push on a raid?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>BabaHanz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Not sure why, it's the officers call /shrug.  My dual wield combo is CHoS and SotB, and I've been told i can not use the hammer, so i use my GSoT when MTing.  For dps, i strictly use the WMBS.  I also know that as a whole, the guild has a problem with pushing the mob, so maybe that has something to do with it.</div></div><hr />
