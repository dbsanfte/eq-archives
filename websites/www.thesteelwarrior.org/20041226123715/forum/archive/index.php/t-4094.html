<br />
The Warrior Epic quest guys are in that section of town. Stay up on the ledge, don't go &quot;down&quot; into it. You'll see them near a tent on the ledge, upper part, of the area.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />

<br />
usually it's an errant training from someone KOS who aggro's a guard and ends up attacking Wenden ( /whistles innocently )</div></div><hr />

Although really, freeport is like one big ghetto. You should be able to sneak in through the underground. I did this before i had an invis item and only had to deal with one unlucky guard &gt;:) Id probably be tolerated (agnostic DE) but knocking slate around was too tempting ;)</div></div><hr />
