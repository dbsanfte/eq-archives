1) good places to level for different skill levels e.g. level X to x - go to zone x?<br />
2) ways to make money, which ones are better, good places to get items from creatures that are worht selling?<br />
3) questing, are there any specific quests that i should take at low levels, good ways to get quests?<br />
4) how do you get the link  that shows your items, money skills and other such seen in a lot of the higher level characters?<br />
5) Guilds, what is a good level to join a guild, what levels are most guilds looking for?<br />
 <br />
Thank you very much for those of you who answer my questions, I hope i can become a regular in this forum as it looks very helpful</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">The Cromn</div><div class="date">05-15-2004, 07:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1. Everyone has differant places they like for levels. So, just get some friends (or a guild) and just go have fun. Levels will happen as you play.<br />
2. money/loot- Everyone again has their own places for making cash. Best bet, do your web research. Go to bazaar, find items that sell for a good price, then search the web to find out where it drops. Or, again, ask friends/guild where stuff is, or just go play and have fun. Gear and loot happens as you play.<br />
3. For warrior quests, again search the web. Alakhazam`s Magic Realm(spelling?) has a great quest search engine. It can search quests by zone, faction, class, etc <br />
  But, if a true noobie, and want to do what alot of us did when young, make your quested Crafted armor(quest starts in Southern Plains of Karana). Yes, you could probably buy it cheaper then it costs to make/quest it, but it`s a decent noobie quest(20-30s). And if you want a quest for the 5-15 range, just do your birth town noobe quest armor quest given to you by your guild masters.<br />
4. The link we all use is called a Magelo profile. I`ll give you the link and you can figure it out from there. http://www.magelo.com<br />
5. As for guilds. Every server has tons of guilds. Each with their own rules and requirements and all. Some for the power high end gamers, some for the begginer noobies. Best bet, make some friends around your level. Eventualy you`ll just find a guild suited for you. And if you just want a guild bad! Go to the Plane of Knowledge and watch the /shout or /ooc channels. Guilds often open recruit for players in them channels. <br />
 Basicaly. Since your a true noobie as you claim to be, the best thing you can do is to find a noobie guild. A guild that is taking recruits of all levels and classes. You`ll usualy find that most of these guilds are filled with people like yourself. Just learning EQ. Most players start there. It`s about the best place to learn all the information you`ll need to learn EQ and grow into a seasoned player. There is usualy a few members in even noobie guilds that have a good working knowledge of EQ, and are willing to help teach you.<br />
<br />
 Good luck, and have fun.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lamont</div><div class="date">05-18-2004, 12:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well Mr Garamoore. All i have to say is that you are in a position a lot of us would love to be. &quot;a true noobie&quot; back the day when i was a newbie i loved exploring and questing all by my self, back the day when the game caused some wierd sensations of excitement. <br />
<br />
I don't know what happened but it was probably web research, maps, quest solutions, and the urge of becoming big and powerful as a character that slowly took away that &quot;discovering the unknown&quot; feeling i had when started playing. <br />
<br />
So, my best advice would be try not to run and enjoy what is before you now, that way this game is like no other.<br />
