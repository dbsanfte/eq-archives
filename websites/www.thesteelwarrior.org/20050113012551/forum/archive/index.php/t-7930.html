<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Guy</div><div class="date">07-07-2004, 03:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, within the next few days I may be falling into about 100k, so I'm asking advice on how I should spend it on upgrades. My thoughts were to pick up the droga combo, as those will last me a long while as aggro weapons, then replacing some weak slots (earring, chest, etc.). for the chest I'm looking at a fierce heraldic BP, along with FH boots and bracer. Not sure what to do about the earring, or any other slots depending on how much cash I have left over. Here's my magelo http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1013952.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">07-07-2004, 04:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">you got it right on your developpement, go for the droga then FH then will certainly have to wait a bit to ragain cash for non  visible slot. the time you get their OoW might be relaese (only 5 weeks left I think) so now possibility may arise for you at the bazzard, or the old ones will just get more afordable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">07-07-2004, 08:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As a general rule if in my early 50s I picked up a one-time load of plat I would consider things in this order:<br />
1. Haste<br />
2. Weapons<br />
3. small stuff (hang on, I'll explain)<br />
4. Armor<br />
<br />
In most cases, I'd look for something that could carry you to 65 without having to be replaced until you have access to at least some mobs that drop items you can use. <br />
You also need to pay attention to opportunity cost. For example, 36% haste is better than 31% haste, but the difference might cost you 30K--even if you have 100K, that's problably not worth the armor upgrades you could get.<br />
I put the weapons in there because you can afford the Droga set and it'll last you a good while. You buy them and you don't have to worry about your aggro set-up until you can loot better. <br />
I listed small stuff next because some of it is pretty cheap: stat food, for example. Your one earring is pretty weak, so you might search the bazaar for anything cheap with AC.<br />
You are right to be thinking cultural armor for the big slots. I assume that you realize that your face and back are relatively strong, your gothic, crusty and crafted are ready to be replaced.<br />
To make cultural armor, a smith needs infused rings. Each ring requires a blue diamond; these rings are the most expensive part of the job. Bracers, collar, boots (heh, I think), and the visor all all one-ring items. Pauldroons, vambraces, gauntlets, girdle and helm are 2-ring items. Cloak, breastplace, greaves are 3-ring. Get yourself a list of the AC, hps, &amp; stats of each item, then see what gets you the most bang for your buck given what you are wearing now. If you are in a guild, ask around to see if there's a smith who can do FH armor. <br />
I wouldn't be in a huge hurry to spend the whole 100K before I took a good look around the bazaar and had a very good idea what your server's economy is like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Guy</div><div class="date">07-07-2004, 07:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, took Brabble's advice and went in that order. I spend lots of time in the bazaar, so the economy of my server is no mystery to me, pretty much everything is overpriced, so I spent accordingly. I managed to find a soulscream belt (first one I've seen for sale on my server in a few weeks) for 30k, took care of worn haste. I then picked up the Droga combo for about 25k combined. Replaced my 2 sta earring with a jagged bone hoop, then picked up a fierce heraldic BP and gauntlets. All in all this ran about 88k, so I'm sitting at 12k left. Would like to know which spots you think are my weakest and maybe some viable upgrades. Not too long ago I saw FH boots for around 7 k, I was thinking if they perhaps went back up (if not already sold) Iw ould get those. Here's my magelo after the upgrades http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1013952<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">07-07-2004, 07:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Keep buying FH.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">07-07-2004, 08:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you have the GoD expansion, then as a general rule, don't break the bank on haste.  41% tribute haste does not cost much to maintain (compared to the cost of a Soulscream belt), and 31% costs even less.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frostpaw</div><div class="date">07-07-2004, 10:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">/agree Sassinak about tribute haste. Would sell Soulscream and buy FH whenever you can find a decent deal.  Once you have full FH you can concentrate on non-visible slots as you level. Ornate is such a small upgrade to FH you won't have to sweat replacing the FH for quite a while (at least until you can get ornate drops for free).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Guy</div><div class="date">07-08-2004, 02:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thing is I don't have GoD yet, and probably won't be getting it for some time. So at this stage the soulscream is pretty necessary. I will be looking for FH upgrades in the bazaar from now on though, and maybe some of the non visible items (thinking Amulet of Mummy Wrappings for neck, doing the draconic pauldrons quest for shoulders, etc.)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Guy</div><div class="date">07-14-2004, 03:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, running into a problem in upgrades...it would seem that my server isn't at the point yet where there are tons of master tradeskillers (IE makers of fierce heraldic). Been trying for days, but can't find greaves, boots or vambraces (there are however cobalt vambraces for 1k). Should I try to go with some alternatives or weather the storm and just wait until some FH pops up? Some items I was thinking are Boots of the Kunzar Wanderer (25 ac, 8 dex, 8 stam, 45hp and some saves) and Kylong Shinguards (34 ac, 4 sta, 6 wis, 6 int, 8 agil, 45hp). Also there's a rock molded wristguard for sale at the same prices as the only FH bracer for sale right now on my server, they come out about equal in points (using 1ac=1stam=6hp), but the FH has the saves on it as well. Any advice and other affordable suggestions (around 65k) are appreciated. Here's my magelo http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1013952<br />

<br />
About the gear, without cultural wou've really slowed your gear progression down. My best guess is to do the SS armor quests. I think thats what agnostics do now days...not sure though. Just buy what you can, quest whats left.</div></div><hr />
