<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Since the last patch, I've been spending as little time as possible in PoK (outrageous zone-specific lag, crashing, computer lock-ups). I'm not saying the zone is bugged, but when I want to play the game, I stay the heck out of there.<br />
Long ago, back when such things mattered, I got to ally in Qeynos, and so I've been banking and selling and tradeskilling there and in Halas.<br />
The other day I was in South Qeynos and no one else was there. The zone, of course, was lag-free, and I was struck by the care that had gone into the design of the place, the weird bits of npc dialog, the texture of the buildings, and so forth. I thought about how much of the game I haven't really played--I haven't done most of the quests in Qeynos, and I guess like everyone else I can't imagine doing them now, as they are impossible to do if you can use the reward, and completely without reward if you are high enough to finish them.<br />
And yet, especially considering how long ago this zone was designed, someone really worked hard on it. The design of it is far richer, for example, than PoK.<br />
It's as if the game were not originally designed to be a rack-em-and-stack-em slasher movie filmed in colorless dungeon corridors.<br />
And no one is there. It's like WK, except it's a major starting city for new characters. Or, anyway, it used to be. Back when there were new players.<br />
Yeah, I knew on an intellectual level that this was going on. But I found it disturbing to actually be standing in Qeynos, completely alone, on one of the oldest servers in the game.<br />
SONY's got bigger problems than whether or not they should nerf GoD mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">pictures in a museum bro. you were simply enjoying what once was the golden days of EQ.<br />
<br />
Yup; Shikarii was born in Qeynos. Little seedy bar in the back of the town was where my basket was found when my parents abandoned me ( was part of my RP history of shikarii when I could fantasize about roleplaying in EQ )....Out of all the towns that I frequented Qeynos always had an aura of mystery and 'larger than life' feeling whnever I went there. and yes; I would run and take the boat there from Kelethin just to reminisce about all the zones I grew up and hunted in and never felt like time was wasted running there.<br />
<br />
But; eh; preserve the museum zones that are Qeynos and Erudin and the likes.....Even lonely Halas has had some great times associated with it; and just wandering around there as the snow falls on those dark winter nights brought me to a place I wish I could have found in EQ before I left.<br />
<br />
Oh well. If only the walls could speak; the stories they would tell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kamce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I hear ya Brabble.  I have an old high school buddy that decided to start a new toon after a year and a half out of the game.  He does not like to PL his toons so he was hitting some of the old low level stomping grounds and QHills was one of them.  I popped over to visit and this whole part of the world is a ghost town, as are almost all the cities and outlying areas.</div></div><hr />

back when the game was just made by VI, it was the shit, but when SoE bought them out, then the stuff you see now started to pop up (game wise, not community wise)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Groovdog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Think it has more to do with latest and greatest syndrome. I came to EQ from DAOC about 4 months ago. That is not a commonplace move and how many people are beginning PC based MMOPGs now? Growth is PS2/XBox (i.e. the masses) not the PC for this type of gaming. People like slick and EQ (and DX9 patch highlighted this as DAOC had better graphics a year ago then EQ does now) is not that. But depth it does have, but most newbies want to be killing Quarm out of the gate (although not entirely guilty as charged, I do somewhat resembe that remark).<br />

Wife was born a Human Cleric, I a Barbarian Warrior. I never took to freeport much as the place was huge and crowded so I travelled much between the cities. I remember Banking my precious bronze armor and gear and trekking across the lands, Killing some young skels or orcs for emergancy weapons. Things like stopping for binds in Rivervale and navigating the lands by landmarks and only your own knowledge. The long climb up to High hold was a  particular favorite of mine.<br />

Not that I hate ports or TP stones but everyone should make that run on foot at least once. Its worth the experiance.  I hope to get myself a horse or resonable speed someday So I can sightsee some of my old haunts that are out of the way.<br />

There've been some changes over the past year that I have liked.  But I don't think any EQ experience has topped the night I was practicing pottery for my Thurgadin gate potion and stumbled into one of the barroom dialogues, and the whole *temperance* thread.  I followed that dwarf around thru the whole thing, delighted.  Showed it to my girlfriend the next night.  (Which she reminded me of some month later, when she was in Thurgadin and I made her follow the guy around.)<br />
<br />
The Vision wasn't perfect, but the design intent to create context was spot on.</div></div><hr />

Hehe I remember when I first started on Xev...right after the Povar/Tarew servers had allowed poeple to movelog to it.  I was born in Freeport and spent probably my first 15 or so levels there (which back then took me about 2 months or more to complete).<br />
<br />
I'll never forget the when I finally decided to venture out beyond the commons/oasis of marr area.  I ran from Freeport to Qeynos, with no maps, no SoW, leather armor (maybe a peice or 2 of bronze) and my trusty velium mace and Blade of Passage.  The journey took me literally all day to make.  Every new zone I had to /who and ask in /ooc or with tells for directions.  Highpass was a maze, and frankly had groups not been there hunting gnolls and orcs I would have died for sure.<br />
<br />
I can still remember coming up on the giant wooden bridge in East Karana.  It blew my mind....and I spent about 10 minutes just switching views and rotating the camera to take it all in.  I finally died west karana from bandits on the road, but not before doing a successful /who and seeing a cleric in zone.  After i popped back at spawn i sent her a tell, explaining what had happened to me and asking if she could rez my corpse.  It took a little while but she was able to find me and rez me back in.  I spent the next several levels hunting in Blackburrow and Everfrost.  I met a bunch of new people who had started on that side of Antonica and never ventured over near Freeport and the Commonlands yet.<br />
<br />
It's amazing how much of that you bypass now with the books and twinkery.  Twinks were generally looked down upon when I first started.  Beggers were abhored.  And I don't think anyone had thought of selling their accounts yet  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Merc<br />
<br />
Your story with that bridge brought back alot of old memories. I remember trying to outrun those lions to get across that bridge heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>XAclylospradaX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">There was nothing like that first trip from Freeport to Qeynos. I was in the oasis around lvl 15 and heard the group talking about the city. Eventualy that day I had asked a wizzy if he could port me there, instead I got a port to the karana's.  I also spent much of that day trying to navigate through the Karana's, being completly lost and not knowing what sense heading was. <br />
<br />
I made it to Qeynos a the next day, it wasn't as populated as Freeport was but it had it's own &quot;hometown&quot; feeling to it, even though I was a visitor I wanted to be at home. So I headed to the Warrior Guildmaster, through a bloody mess of an arena :P , I found the npc who gave me the Battlemaster's Armor information. Even though I had finished up the armor quest in Freeport just before leaving to Qeynos, I was driven to finish this new and exciting quest, thinking it would benefit me more.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
When CR's took hours and traveling was actually a hard task, it gave the game an innocence that I highly doubt I'll ever get back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sorguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I remember way back when I started EQ I had a bard at level 19, I was such a well geared toon, mostly due to the kindness of others, and the fact that I was always willing to help anyone I could,  all the people I met, going back to my hometown, the trips across the Karanas on the paths I had memorized.  As a bard I felt so great because I could actually make all those trips, I kept playing that bard up till the mith marr split, once drinal came out, I moved to bertox.<br />
<br />
I started on Bertox as an enchanter.  I remember being so rich back then (1k plat in my bank)  from just doing breezes in oasis all day.  Then I started a druid for ports, and then a warrior for fun, the warrior survived, the others didn't.<br />
<br />
I deleted my ench awhile back, what a sad sad day, I still remember all the fun I had during RoK and SoL.<br />
<br />
If EQ could bring me back to those kinda starting out memories, or really if ANY MMORPG could bring that, and make it stay, it would be actually worth coming back to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I still play the toon I started with 3 years ago, my lil warrior :) I remember doing quests for the Steel Warriors in FP and killing that halfling at the inn to loot her head! Awesome! :D Then running all the way from FP to Qeynos, good God when I found my first werewolf haha, and when I crossed Kith at night.... I asked someone else to lead me to Rivervale, and I was actually, using the map that came with Kunark, that pointed out the cities (I didnt know what 'zones' were haha), and I made it to Qeynos with that map! (After a few deaths). Fishing at the docks in BB with my druid friend, getting drunk in Thurg and buying souvenir smugs, taking the boat and visiting Firiona, actually the boats worked with no problem back then, and that HUGE boat to FV was awesome... when it's 'wings' spreaded and it went so fast... I even remember going to a wedding there... ppl used to get married on EQ... I have yet to go to a wedding in 2 years sadly :(<br />
I think the expansion that thrilled me more was Velious... but I cant forget the days of Loio Windmill :) And going to the fort in FM for the first time... damn, giants were big :p<br />
Damn, the memories :)<br />
<br />
Sitting in NK, on the guard tower, watching the sunset with a friend is one of those things you always remember about I guess :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wubao was from Qeynos. His parents were killed by gnolls and he was raised by Lu Sun in the Order of the Silent Fist. His lineage went allllllll the way back to the Combine Empire (which is why, I finally felt complete when one of the last major boss mobs I got to kill with my guild was Lord Inquisitor Seru, even though we'd long since been in the elemental planes).<br />
<br />
Man, Qeynos ... so many good memories.<br />

Now adays every runs to CB like it aint no thing but I remember back when it was just RoK. Them gobies were friggin mean. Then I learned of the chessboard. Talk about fun. I made it to cb around lvl 10 or so and wow was that amazing. (The early train zone.)<br />
<br />
I as well remember runnin from Butcherblock all the way over to Blackburrow.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Jamylah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">While I didn't start playing EQ until sometime between Luclin and PoP, I certainly have some memories of Qeynos and the like. My first major character is still the character I play, a half-elf warrior who worships Erolissi Marr. I remember making up her life-story, being abandoned by my human mom and wood elf dad on Sister Island in OOT, because they had no choice. <br />
      My BF played a halfing druid at that time and making that run through Kithicor the first time so we could group together was one of my scariest times playing the game (and it was even during the daytime) I shudder at the memories of trying to make it to HHK at night through Kithicor. <br />
     When I started playing around in the Karanas, I remember trying to make it to the Nexus spires, or to EK or SK, while praying a lion didn't attack me. And grouping in Splitpaw was a ton of fun, it made me sad doing the fireworks stick quest for the 5-yr anniversary and a lvl 65 seeing me playing with my new toy asked how to get to Splitpaw.<br />
   And finishing all my newbie armor was one of the proudest days of my EQ life, I still have my mail-kit in the bank just so I don't forget how much trouble that was, before I had actually had some plat to buy new things.<br />
   Once I was helping a friend camp his eyepatch of plunder, waiting for that stupid Stormfeather to spawn, and the 5 or so sunsets we watched while waiting for him to spawn, (damn mob never did while I was helping him) were some of the prettiest I've ever seen in the game. <br />
   Although I do have to say, I was with a friend in Abysmal Sea doing the new Tradeskilling quests, although my skill is higher than almost all of them, and some of the NPC's in the taverns and such are absolutely hilarious, reminds me of some of the old-world NPCs. There are still these senses of feeling in the newer expansions, you just have to know where to look. =)<br />
<br />
Wow, that was quite the thread of stream of consciousness...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Varaho</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Threads like this make me feel old :(<br />
<br />
For anyone wondering Varaho started out as a human Pirate Warrior in Freeport who had abandoned his family of casters for a life of adventure hijacking dorfs for gold and slaying many enemies with his blades. By pure luck I picked to worship Rallos and actually ended up having the faction to match this story :p<br />
<br />
I liked the boats, the first few times I road them~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>CikkoYuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I was thinkin they should do some revamps to the old zones to make them a little more appealing to all levels to bring some functionality back to the zones and let people stay there.  <br />
<br />
<br />
  Allow Bazaar traders in cities, there are already a few blank vendor stalls that could use some lovin.<br />
  Allow cheaper prices with your home town on all goods.  Reduce gems, tradeskill components, so people do their work, purchases and banking at home.  <br />
  Allow purchase of items that are only found in certain homes back in the home towns.  IE Horses and some select spell vendors.  Maybe have them only spawn in at certain times like wandering traders offering goods from other cities.  I know they've already got a way to verify you have an expansion before allowing you to purchase certain items.<br />
  Fix the damn boats and make them alot faster.  I personally wouldnt mind taking them if they took less than 20 minutes to ride.  Offer vendors on the boats perhaps like bartenders,  we could have drunken pirate adventures :&gt;<br />
 Allow instant camping at inns if you are clear of agro. Yea, so it's a little like UO.  But it was the smartest thing they ever did :P  Doesnt make sense having to set up camp inside a room with a bed now does it?<br />
<br />
Thats pretty much all I can think of, anyone else have any suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Goradain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I used to have a blast grinding in Blackburrow.  And the Bandit Camps in WK.  And I also remember my first run from Halas to Freeport.  A couple friends I met at the Green Room in Blackburrow wanted to take me to this really fun zone called Oasis.  I, of course, made sure to get a bind in Freeport immediately.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Dacke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Started my main, a dark elf necromancer back in may 2001, i spen't hours just running around neriak taking in the sights, good part is i ended up knowing the place rather well :)<br />
<br />
I even remember the adventures of going to the newbie log in nektulos, scary it was, and once i made it to the bridge i felt i was the king of the world  :D <br />
Exploring into the commonlands was such a great feeling back then, today *yawn* no sensation anymore.<br />
<br />
Even though i play many online games now, eq, ao, horizons, eve and neocron no game has ever given me me the same sensational feelings everquest did, guess is is because eq was the first ever online game i tried and that made it special.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Tharak Soulhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Nah, you guys aren't going back far enough. I started, out of pure ignorance, a half-elf ranger in Surefall on opening day and here are some of my fond memories....<br />
<br />
Finally finding my guildmaster to turn in my note, only to hit the attack key when attempting to talk to him....<br />
<br />
Looking at the fish in the little lake in Surefall and accidentally falling in, only to realize I didn't know how to swim....<br />
<br />
Finding my RL buddy in Qeynos hills and trying to show him where the ranger guild master was. Then realizing he was a human and couldn't see inside the tunnel to Surefall because it was dark. After being &quot;lost&quot; for an hour he rerolled a half-elf.....<br />
<br />
Attaining my first combine weapon and killing a wisp while the crowd of people behind me looked on in astonishment at the feat.......<br />
<br />
Falling into the pit in the middle of blackburrow while chasing a mob and losing all of my hard earned cloth armor and the 1 plat that I had accumulated. Never did find that damn corpse.......<br />

Finally getting a piece of banded armor, a helm no less, and realizing I was wearing a frickin frisbee.........<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Raargh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">what you are seeing is the difference between the pre and the post SoE buyout... <br />
<br />
you should confront Solusek B and C design<br />
<br />
check them and you will notice immediatly the difference<br />
<br />
Nagafen Lair has a contort, labirinthic design. you have the feeling that whoever made that zone, tried his best to get you lost down there. the zone has his own atmosphere<br />
<br />
Solusek C is just another &quot;perfect&quot; dungeon. room, then a straight corridor, a T cross, another room, a corridor that turn to 90degrees and end in another room with 4 directions and so on<br />
<br />
there is no feeling in it, its like LDoN.....some pre-made rooms attached to each other to make a dungeon. so sad, really<br />
<br />
you can see what is the difference between VI and SoE. for VI make a dungeon was create a living place<br />
<br />
look at Sebilis, at Velk Lab, Dragon Necropolis, the incredible design of Echo Cavern. they are unique, they give you feelings when you enter them<br />
<br />
the dungeons made by SoE (ALL LDoN, Solusek_C and Chardok_B, GoD ) lack of their own life</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Frig Coldheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Little history from me too. I started right as kunark was released. My first char was a dwarf cleric on Luclin. A friend at work got me hung on eq he we a high lvl and gonna help me out. He was a lvl 14 druid =).<br />
<br />
Memories I will always cherish is my first run from FP to Qeynos at lvl 14. Man that was scary. The necroes in WK killed me had to get a lvl 50 bard in the zone to drag me away from their camp so I could loot my gear. I still remember my first trip to Kunark. Took the boat from Butcherblock to FV. Died making the run from FV to Loio up the river (dang spiders). I am sure some of you who played good races remember fondly the run to get to Overthere at level 30. That was a big deal to get all the way from Antonica to Overthere for non evil's.<br />
<br />
Sadly I feel those days of actually learning zones by memory and having to learn what zones connected to what zones along with all the other new character experiences are gone. I believe this actually hurts alot of the newer players they do not truly appreciate the true nature of EQ.</div></div><hr />

You know, I always wondered WTF was that room on the lower level of the boat, the first time I saw it, I thought, &quot;Cool, a BAR! Where is the bartender??&quot;... all these years I wished they would add a bartender to those boats... actually going down there would have a point.<br />

I remember my awe the first time I went into High Keep. Still love that zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Tugurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I have mixed feelings about Qeynos. My very first character, 5 years ago or whatever, was actually created in Qeynos -- and promptly drowned twice. Had no idea how to swim around or get out of the pool. Then I could never figure out Qeynos's layout (no maps then). Felt like I was trapped in a maze. <br />
<br />
So I became a Freeport man. I figured out Freeport, could get around in it, and had access to the EC tunnel for bazaar stuff. Developed a kind of loyalty to Freeport, so I made it a point even on my ogre (who became my main) to develop Freeport faction -- in all areas of Freeport. I used to get all kinds of tells when I banked in Freeport, because there were basically no ogres there then.<br />
<br />
But I certainly appreciate the care with which Qeynos was crafted. I remember all the little quests, which I found very fascinating initially. I think it's sad Everquest's quest engine was always so limited and so lame. That to me was the great unfulfilled promise of EQ, despite it's astonishing depth.<br />
<br />
Anyway, Qeynos and those old zones did have a hand-crafted feel to them. Modern zones, especially LDoN, feel like they've been produced by an automated zone generator. <br />
<br />
Nice post Brabble. Haven't played EQ in months, but maybe I'll log in and make a new character today -- in Qeynos.</div></div><hr />

Aren't those things used in some sort of cheap alchemy skillup?) when suddenly there's a shout from a newbie: Anyone know where the warrior trainer is?<br />
Ah, yes. Someone does. <br />
I ask &quot;Where are you now?&quot;<br />
&quot;I'm looking at some dogs in a pen.&quot;<br />
&quot;Okay, stay right there....&quot;<br />
Lol.<br />
Later the warrior fell in the water and I had to explain how one swims before the warrior drowned--<br />
&quot;Okay, punch the page up key...it's number 9 on your keyboard&quot;<br />
(Warrior, who I can see from the dock, starts spinning around in circles) &quot;Where am I?&quot;<br />
My laughter was checked only by the memory of dying in the water once myself there. This young warrior lived, though.<br />
So, there are a few new players out there still.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">My wife and I started playing exactly 12 months ago. We were on Brell for a short while before Stromm opened. When we started playing, we had one account and took turns driving the toon. We had to abandon our first character because we got trapped in the bank (we didn't know how to make the door open) ....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Lorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Wow the memories,<br />
<br />
I remember running around GFay in the trees and peering down below.  I had stumbled on one of the bridges and had fallen off the platform only to see the Loading Please Wait . . . screen.<br />
<br />
My first real toon was a gnome wiz.  I remember marveling at the gnome city, getting completely lost inside.  When my bro finally lead me out, I got lost outside Steamfont Mts and I wondered onto those huge windmills.<br />
<br />
Its everything about the old ways that Made the game great.  Even the music gave me one of those feelings that this was an awsome game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Khuan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I started like a month or so after PoP came out, my RL brother Goradain tried to get me to play a year before that and i just didnt take a liking to it, well now 2 years and some odd months later i'm still at it, grinding out AA's (which isnt any fun) and raiding the planes. He took me to all his old stomping grounds and showed me around, this was before mapping was available and we had to go download and print out maps, and he'd pencil spots on the maps to avoid and the zones. It was so much fun, i remember playing one day when he was gone, somehow made it to GD at like lvl 19, and was in awe at the zone, it was huge! and was breathtaking ,and so was getting stomped by some guy 20 times bigger then me (and i'm an ogur) So yeah i was born in pop era, but dont like it, its all so boring, even now that im 2 kills away from time, its all the same as pre-elemental, boring, half assed zones, same mobs as PoN, PoD, PoV, etc just new names and hit harder. And the news of a zone revamp almost makes me happy till I go to it and see how crappy it is after revamp, like CoM, was fun place when i was in my 30's (i think long time ago) and now I take my alts down there to grind and they damn near kill me (65 sk) i think they need to leave the old world zones alone, they are perfect the way VI intended them, VI took pride in theyre work, took time in theyre work, and loved theyre work.  The only credit i can give to SoE is that i still think PoI is cool, its very unique zone with tons of quests and mobs that actuallly arnt duped in another zone! OMG :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Zanakus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Zanakus Kargoror was born September 26, 2000. I'm being honest when I admit that I have yet to experience a year as exciting, exhilarating and immersive as his first year on Norrath - back when I worked my ass off to buy the oh-so-uber bronze armour and axe of the iron back, and zones like Lake Rathe were packed to the point where they'd have waiting lists on camps.<br />
<br />
 Those were the days, indeed! I have to agree with the others on this thread that the SoE-made zones are more formulaic and less, well, real than Verant's. I think that a good analogy for this is that SoE's zones are the row of tract homes whereas Verant's are the beautiful, handmade-with-care log cabins and mansions on the hill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Foof</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">haha good ol' times. i rember learning my way around halas withought maps .. it was such a pain it all looked the same to me at the beggining but by the time i was lvl 12 or so i could go to permafrost to bb and back to halas with my eyes closed =P taking my first adventure out of hallas was crazy. i rember runing for hours it seemed acrrost he karranas hoping not to get pwnd by a dark blue con.  and boy was i a nube hehe i didnt learn that i could kick till level 9, i would always fight close to guards for fear of my life, and i still rember shouting over and over for a port back to halas</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Klozz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Great thread, and excellent points about the difference between the VI game and the SOE game.  The little things made such a big difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Bearhugg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Best thing they should do is restrict the Books to level 25's only. Its a crying shame not to see places like QHills covered in newby corpses. Hehe I remeber my 1st climb up to High Hold Pass got all the way to the top and passed about 4 corpses on the way (probably killed by Lions or those nasty spiders) then fell to my death peeking over the edge, never did get that corpse back ohhh the pain... I loved it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Deathdealer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Great thread. I always like reminiscing about the good old days of EQ when the game really was a fantasy-roleplaying game and not the experience/raid/gear progression grind that it is today. <br />
<br />
I began playing about...hmmm...I don't remember...before Kunark came out whenever that was. My first character was a Half-Elf Ranger and my hometown was the Wood-Elf home of Kelethin. The adventures I found myself in were a blast as there were never a lack of quests to get involved in. And back then, Kelethin was a bustling metropolis with people from all corners of Norrath selling this and that. Even the background game music was great and just added to the fantasy &quot;feel&quot; to the game. Every time I logged in, there was another adventure to fall in to, a new person to meet and group with, and a new zone to explore...or get totally lost in. Back then, you could actually make a little side-cash just by helping people find there way around the few zones that you happened to know. Unfortunately, It was also not uncommon to find myself lost as I was guiding those people to their destinations (especially in Butcherblock). <br />
<br />
It was obvious that alot of care went into this game back then...there were no &quot;cut-and-paste&quot; zones and each zone was unique and provided some new excitement and danger...and of course more adventure. Plus there were plenty of quests that you could do either by yourself or with a handful of people that always took you to some unexpected part of Norrath. <br />
<br />
...sad really...how this game has degenerated in to this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Conanix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Same for my home town of Cabilis. Ever since PoP  towns are empty.<br />
I go back frome time to time and wish PoP had never come out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Just wanted toss this in.  we did the ol' plane of Sky last night to get some mage crowns.<br />
<br />
To say the old death touch design was not completely ridiculous would be an understatement (I counted roughly 30-40 DTs on isle 7 that were COMPLETELY unavoidable).<br />
<br />
Not everything in the old days was so good heheheh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">you kidding? lol, you knew the DT was coming, and you KNEW one or more had your name on them. why do you think guilds recruited so many Gnomes back than? :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Unfortunately even VI didn't get to really polish things. I was most impressed by this game when my youngest son made a Halfling Druid. OMGoodness, Rivervale! The music! Guards in Zoro costumes (sometime later I saw Bristlebane and finally understood the tricksie nature of Halflings)! Noobie quests galore, selling Acorns, begging for a combine for those uber studded boots, Piranahs in the pond, MANGLER!!!! And a mandatory run through Kithcor to reach the greater world beyond. Oh my!<br />
<br />
Kaladim, Kelethin, and Nariak had flavor, but not to my mind quite the same depth. That to me was the initial charm of EQ. A different world, a different atmosphere, and in some ways nearly a different game all due to your choice of class and hometown. Sadly, this aspect of the game soon disappeared in one size fits all raiding and a limitled number of single class quests that didn't take a guild to complete.<br />
<br />
I've looked at the other games, but to my mind they don't have anything near the fit and finish of the original EQ.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">you knew the DT was coming, and you KNEW one or more had your name on them <br />
<br />
hehe we were fresh outta rangers and gnomes!<br />
<br />
Seriously 40+ DTs to clear 1 island really was kinda excessive...it felt like d-day.</div></div><hr />
