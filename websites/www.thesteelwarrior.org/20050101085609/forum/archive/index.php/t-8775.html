<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dundanoor</div><div class="date">09-05-2004, 02:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A question for the masses... what does everyone think is most important to keep intact for EQ2? Do you think they've left anything out from what you've seen on the website/videos/gameplay?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Squizer</div><div class="date">09-05-2004, 08:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">High end content..<br />
Killing dragons is the bread and butter in a Med Fan game and this is what EQ always brought us ( before going killing snakes, gods and some abominations ).<br />
There's a need to see a goal for high lvl, not only about gear and powers but really a big badass mob that gives you the &quot;omfg&quot; effect when you see it 1st time..<br />
<br />
And as far as I've seen, there will be dragons in EQ 2 !!!   :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rexiant</div><div class="date">09-05-2004, 08:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">plus if you read into the lore scattered around, i remember reading that Naggy was freed druing whatever catastrophe tears norrath apart, and that he is currently &quot;whereabouts unknown&quot;. AoW is in the lore as being around also. wether these two, in particualr, will be fightable mobs in the game, or more storyline driven like mayong mistmoore, i do not know.</div></div><hr />

Old days EQ promoted explorations - while present day EQ appeal to lazy kids with short attention span. Reward adventure and courage, like in the old days.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Terrorblade</div><div class="date">09-14-2004, 01:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not that it has been in the game for quite some time for the average player, but they really need to go for the &quot;wow&quot; factor.  Anyone else remember back when only the original EQ was out and the first time you went on a journey from Qeynos to Freeport?  Hit Kithicor just as it turns nighttime and BOOM skellies all around.   :eek:  WOW !! OMG !<br />
<br />
Or the first time you fought a blue mob and bam! it does something totally unexpected.. &quot;WOW,  wasn't expecting that&quot;.  Anymore it's all pretty much the same ol same ol... this mob is such and such level so this mob can do this and/or can't do this.<br />
<br />
Put some excitement into the game again, some unexpected twist.  I don't like to die, but if I die to the unexpected, at least I can get a chuckle out of it.   :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dundanoor</div><div class="date">09-17-2004, 09:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Exactly, they need something to keep our attention beyond the 3 minutes you give a new game. If they have that; then they have sold more than 90% of the rpgs that come out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Everything in EQ2 is supposed to be killable by an average six person group.<br />
<br />
This is the &quot;difference&quot; between EQ and EQ2.  EQ will be for the &quot;raid&quot; crowd and EQ2 will be for the DAOC/WoW crowd.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tarladar Davilan</div><div class="date">09-22-2004, 01:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think that EQ still has that WoW factor. Just we remember back to when we where killing rat's or when we where being chased by the vengful lycist and seeing that huge bear on the tundra following a barb.  all that is still &quot;Wowziers&quot; to people who have not seen it.  I mean i was totally spell bound at the sight of Quarm.  Or even during the raid event's in qvic uqua. the content to wow some one is still their and even though their are bug's and things that seem to just go bumb in the night it is still their just not every one is making it to the &quot;Endgame&quot; and so their expectation dies out with spending to much time in the bazaar and doing to many ldon's... But i preorder eq 2 hehe :) just becuase the char.'s look awesome and that video that comes with the preorder is freakin awesome tooo  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
That'd work... I was thinking anything to make the goddamn game fun again  :(   I never got &quot;burned out&quot; on the game, I just woke up one day without the desire to ever log on again.  The game just isn't fun anymore.</div></div><hr />

The one thing I would totally hate is to buy it and log on the first time and think This is EQ with a better graphics engine. <br />
<br />
I think they have a lot they can learn from the mistakes made in EQ and I honestly hope that they can find a way to not make them in EQ2. I know some of you will say I am asking too much, but a brotha can hope can't he?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Were talking about SOE.  The BETA is not to &quot;change&quot; anything.  It's to stress the servers (3000+ per server) and to verify bug fixes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dundanoor</div><div class="date">10-07-2004, 12:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">True, but then if they didn't listen to us, they'd end up with no customers and a dead game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have noticed patches in beta that address some of the feedback given. That is as much as I am willing to say.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dundanoor</div><div class="date">10-07-2004, 06:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's good. As long as they don't cave in to the gamers and they can maintain a good game also; that's what is important.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Ok, so where did the WOW factor go?  Very simple.  First people who see any new major encounter go &quot;WOW, WTF was that?&quot;.  Then they try it a few times and beat it.  Within a few days, it's plastered over all the websites, strats are posted, etc.<br />
<br />
The guilds following up don't bother trying to figure it themselves.  Everyone flocks to thesteelwarriors and other similar sites, read up on the encounter and then to ahead and replicate.<br />
<br />
Understand where the &quot;WOW&quot; has gone now?  It's not about adventure anymore, it's all about loot, loot, loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GSW</div><div class="date">10-30-2004, 04:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For over half a year i've been retired from EQ and playing FFXI. Now it's time to go back to the darkside - i preordered EQ2.<br />
<br />
I am certainly hoping EQ2 will have the wow factor, in fact i'm almost positive it will. However i also really hope it will not be only in the end-game. EQ was all about end-game. FFXI, despite what some people may say, was filled with plenty of content for all different levels and has plenty of 'wow' stuff at all levels. But of course there was still plenty to look forward to at all times. The endgame of FFXI had its 'wow' stuff too, but the jobs were unbalanced and there were other problems. Sure, FFXI has only been out for 2 years, but SE can't deal with bots(programmed to do stuff, not just characters you play) and professional money farmers, i doubt they'll put much work into the other problems either.<br />
<br />
EQ2 *better* have plenty of interesting content and 'wow' stuff at all levels -  in other words i hope it's not just like EQ with better graphics.<br />
<br />
Also, i forgot to mention something. The previous poster said how the wow factor goes away when all the strategies are posted all over. That was an even bigger problem in FFXI, especially for single group encounters. People would list the jobs you need and often people wouldn't go unless the party is composed of the specific jobs somebody posted in some guide. I really hope EQ2 won't turn out like this - especially in the single group encounters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">faederya</div><div class="date">10-31-2004, 12:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really hope EQ2 won't turn out like this - especially in the single group encounters.<br />
<br />
You do realize EQ2 is composed of pre set &quot;encounters&quot;?<br />
<br />
If the encounter requires x,y, and z and your party has x,x, and z then you won't and can't pass that encounter.  A vast majority of the encounters encompass 4-5 mobs at once, there is no splitting, or off tanking, and mezzing is very limited.  I won't place my opinion on these encounters, you can do that yourself.  I just wanted to make sure you realized that from what you said <br />
<br />

<br />
This sounds exactly the way EQ2 is.  If you don't have two tanks or enough dps or heal power (examples only).  These single (and raid) group encounters can not be won by &quot;thinking outside of the box&quot;.  The encounters are designed with a unbending &quot;box&quot; frame around them.<br />
<br />
They actually just &quot;fixed&quot; the encounters so that you &quot;must&quot; complete the entire encounter or you don't get quest/loot at all.  So if encounter has 5 mobs, and you kill 4 and then wipe or run off then you get no credit for that &quot;attempt&quot;, nothing nada, da nada.  <br />
<br />
EQ2 *better* have plenty of interesting content and 'wow' stuff at all levels <br />
<br />
Be aware that you will be killing gnolls and bears for levels 1-24.  There was a little sarcasm in that :)  I am not comparing this too WoW, but they had a really nice advertisemnt last month and had a statment &quot;So you want to kill more then rats?&quot;  Anyways, just be prepared that EQ2 has kept the &quot;cool looking mobs and scripts&quot; for the higher levels and you wil be fighting basically &quot;rats&quot; for levels up too 20ish.<br />
<br />
I hope I didnt sound too &quot;opinionated&quot; , just trying to make you understand what EQ2 is and isnt.  I have never played FFXI but from your small posting it sounds too me like EQ2 may have &quot;taken&quot; some of its methology for its encounter system from FFXI.<br />
<br />
Fae</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GSW</div><div class="date">10-31-2004, 02:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh joy...well, i hope there's at least good quests and other stuff! People in FFXI exp on bats, beetles, crawlers, and crabs nearly the entire time from 1 to 75. Anything bigger, such as a beastman of some sort, undead, etc is considered too tough for regular exp in many cases. I mean, why kill a level 50 mob that has spells, abilities, and specials that can do a crapload of damage, when you can kill a level 50 crab which doesn't do anything but poke your tank once in a while.  And that poking can be completely avoided!<br />
<br />
Ninja tanks use tools, that cost them money of course, to avoid all melee attacks. They weren't means to tank, but by 'thinking outside of the box' people trivialized half the game and made another job completely unwanted in some encounters. This is the kind of stuff that does *not* belong in EQ2. I like it when there's different methods and strategies to beat everything, but people finding ways to completely trick the game and that going without a nerf isn't very good.<br />
<br />
Gotta give EQ2 a shot anyway, i'm hearing lots of things i like and lots of things i don't like so far. But WoW stinks! and high end FFXI stinks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
EQ2 is different from EQ1, its got far worse gameplay, less classes (4), its easier (everything holds your hand so there's less skill needed), and its a worse graphics engine.  Personally I prefer eq1's look to eq2's and the performance in eq2 is horrible.</div></div><hr />
