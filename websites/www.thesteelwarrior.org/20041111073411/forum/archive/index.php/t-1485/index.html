<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>penasi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have just recently started playing my warrior again (lvl 59 now) and have a question about /shield.  I have it hotkeyed right next to my /assist hotkey and seems to be useful in keeping the casters alive when i loose agro (but that's another post entirely &lt;grumbles about my taunt&gt;).  When the mob changes targets to caster - I usually loose a round or two of damage anyway.  I just hit /assist /shield and go back to smackin the mob.<br />
<br />
My main is a caster and i can say i have NEVER been shielded (main is 65 druid) - nor can I remember it ever being used in my group.  Why is that?  I know it's not the greatest skill in the world - however - i would imagine it to have use in groupes where slows gain immediate agro.<br />
<br />
At the very least - it will give us something to do outside of taunt, kick, use the occasional disc and yell for the cleric to wake up.  <br />
<br />
Any thought would be appreciated why this skill is never used (hehe - or maybe all the warr's just lazy on Brell).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Who would /shield a druid? :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Varaho</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Use &quot;/shield &lt;Over-aggroing casters name&gt;&quot; for a hotkey, it works better.<br />
<br />
<br />
Most people don't use it in the vain hope that people will learn not to draw aggro ever.<br />
<br />
Some people don't use it because they find it a slap in the face ( ask necros how they feel about twitching )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>arative</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have a hot key set up for it, and use it all the time, if a mez is broken and the mob is beating on the enc, for clerics getting healing agro, sometimes even monks coming in a pulls, it does save lives</div></div><hr />

/shield<br />
/pause 1<br />
/assist<br />

<br />
now if only I could figure out how to activate the &quot;toggle between last two targets&quot; key in a hotkey, and it would work even better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">That's how I have mine setup except I didn't add the second /pause 1 and it works fine. <br />
<br />
The only time I have a problem with it is when I'm the one the mob happens to be on at the time I press it. I sometimes click it a second too late.  When this happens I have to retarget the mob manually.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>penasi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">sounds like - from what i'm hearing  - /shield is a good thing?  thanks for the advice on the hotkey - going to adjust mine like yours deamonwynd.<br />
<br />
anyone out there not using this command?  again - i only ask because i never see it used.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Have shield hotkey'd to my chanter at all times. Don't have to use it much but those times when argo becomes fubar or a forced quick slow is needed it can be a life saver. Still swear it gives you an argo modifier because stuff turns off a shield'd person asap i've always found.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Thaloc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have two /shield hotkeys, one for the chanter one for the cleric. I use /shield chantername or /shield cleric name instead of the /assist.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">/assist<br />
/pause 1<br />
/shield<br />
/pause 1<br />
/assist<br />
<br />
assists the mob to whatever it's beating on, shields that person, and then assists back to the mob.<br />
 <br />
<br />
I recommend against this.  Here's a scenario...2 mobs are pulled, chanter gets a resist on a mez.  You move to shield the chanter, and assist on to the mob that he wants mezzed, he mezzes it, you break it, everyone dies.<br />
<br />
Much easier to have a hotkey for the people that need it with their name in it, rather than assuming that someone else has the correct target.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I use /assist hotkey.<br />
Works wonders on raids, and save a few lives with it :p<br />
<br />
See a summoned caster? hit the hotkey and voila.<br />
<br />
Don't see why people put a reverse assist once the victim is shielded though....<br />
just hit f8, or hit your assist key /shrug.<br />
<br />
As for when adds come in, I usually just have /shield -encahnter-, already all typed out :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">That situation doesn't happen, haas.<br />
<br />
That hotkey assists the mob I'm currently fighting, therefore, it wouldn't be getting mezzed, it's the one I'm fighting.<br />
<br />
That hotkey doesn't affect mobs that the chanter's trying to mez. Those either require a /shield chanter hotkey, or a quick typing of /shield enc.<br />
<br />
I personally don't have the room for two or more hotkeys for those shield hotkeys, that's the most versatile one I can come up with for only taking one shot... having a /shield chanter and /shield cleric takes up two spots, and doesn't address when say, the shaman or wizzie's the one getting aggro. Not to mention ya gotta keep changing em.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">While you may recognize that the chanter situation requires a different hotkey, I just wanted to point out that it will fail to anyone who's reading and thinks &quot;Hrm, I should make a hotkey like that,&quot; and think they can use it in any situation and be doing the right thing.<br />
<br />
So, for the sake of anyone less knowledgable reading, don't use a hotkey like that to shield your enchanter when he's doing his work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>waeolwen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">On my warrior, I have the &quot;/shield&quot; and &quot;/assist&quot; hotkeys right next to each other. So I can hit /assist and then instantly hit /shield. BTW... I use it ALL the time, even on the main tank if I'm not. Comes in very handy... :)<br />
<br />
And...GAH!!!...I need to update my sig... I'm 62 now, almost 63 :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">You need to be more specific, Haass, if you want to get that point across.<br />
<br />
Don't use that hotkey to shield the chanter if he's getting hit by a mob that you're not presently fighting, for example, mezzing an add. Instead, use AE taunt.<br />
<br />
DO use this hotkey if the chanter gets aggro on the mob you are presently fighting, for example by slowing too early.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Groticus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I use the shield ability whenever needed in exp groups and almost never on raids.  I have 3 keys for shielding  when exping.  One very handy for the slower, one fairly handy for the cleric and a miscilaneous one incase I have a chanter and shammy in the group.  I just go ahead and type there names into the keys with each new group.<br />
<br />
As a side note I have found this ability works much better when you tell the person they are being shielded.  So I add a secodn line something like /g Shielding So and So.  Makes it much better IMHO.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was very specific in my first post on this topic...I didn't know I needed to completely repeat the entire post in order to get my point across.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Hotkeyed shield is absolutely THE OWN :<br />
<br />
1= atk 2= taunt 3= disarm 4=kick 5=assist 6=announce 7=sit 8=discipline<br />
<br />
9 = /SHIELD SLOWER<br />
10 = /SHIELD HEALER<br />
<br />
You can not even barely imagine how many deaths i have prevented this way.<br />
Shield because of its reduced timer is a very powerfull tool.<br />
<br />
Shield = zero range LoH , its absolutely awesome if used correctly<br />
<br />
Think about it .....  a 5k hp cleric .... pulls agro .... goes down to 3k (thats 3 bubbles)<br />
You shield him .... he now has 6Khp left (thats more than a LoH)<br />
<br />
The hard part is just to get people to STAY in shield range while you use it.<br />
It takes some time, but they adapt quickly.<br />
<br />
Shield = 2 or 3 mins (i can never remember) LoH<br />
<br />
Not using it is STUPID. Shield TRIPLED my group versatily &amp; utility in xp.<br />
<br />
As for raiding .....<br />
If u are a fast typer or hotkeyer (/assist + /shield) you get :<br />
A FREE 2(3)  MINUTE TIMER LoH every time a caster/priest is<br />
 summoned by the mob you are fighting. (thats trash mob)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Tugurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">When I join an exp group, I usually just change my /shield hotkey to /shield &lt;slower&gt;, or to whoever I think is most likely to generate aggro who shouldn't have it. I don't like these /assist, /shield hotkeys, since in multipull situations it gets dicey -- not everyone being attacked is on the same mob, etc. I pop /shield constantly in groups -- why not?<br />
<br />
Why have an attack button hotkeyed, when there's a keyboard shortcut for it already?</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are a couple risks with this setup that need to be considered and planned for by the user (there are more I am sure):<br />
<br />
1) If the mobs aggro returns to you faster than you can push the hot button, then you end up targeting yourself on the last /assist.<br />
<br />
2) If your mob starts beating on the enchanter while the enchanter is trying to mez another mob, then you will end up targeting the other mob and do risk the chance of breaking mez.<br />

Number 2 is what Haass was talking about.<br />

<br />
Very true.  I also wondered why he would have a sit hotkey when you can simply press alt+s.<br />
<br />
Helpful tips, warriors.  Thank you. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Bad habit :) <br />
<br />
When i first started a friend put 1=ATK ..... <br />
Over the years well i got used to it.<br />
<br />
As for the sit ... well when he hotbox went from 6 to 10 slots<br />
I didnt need that many boxes, so put sit at 7th .......<br />
<br />
Habits are VERY VERY hard to get rid of :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>mazzarek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">No one has come right out and said this, but I think /shield is best used when Area Taunt isn't back up yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Eh, I don't think, in my entire time using this shield hotkey, have I ever woken up a mob the chanter was trying to mez. Since it happens so rarely, it's not really even worth consideration.<br />
<br />
And, no, Hass, you didn't have to repost it. But you DID need to be more specific than don't use that hotkey on the chanter while he's doing his work. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Well, here, I'll give you another reason why using /assist is a bad idea.<br />
<br />
That entire hotkey relies on 1 assumption --- that everyone else in your group has the same target you have.  Maybe your cleric is healing the shaman.  Maybe your chanter just slowed the mob, then went to refresh haste on you when the mob decided he was pissed.<br />
<br />
I never trust anyone else to be on the target they are supposed to be...making one mistake like that can cost you big time, both in reaction time from losing your target and like I said earlier, possible mez breakage.  Even if it happens 1 in 100 times, that's too much a risk to waste on a hotkey that skips all that shit and just shields the person.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Darkoan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Another problem with the /assist /shield hotkey is that many Shamans and other healers will instantly target themselves and start mashing a Chloroblast/Remedy when they see the mob turn to them.  Therefore, you'll wind up with them targetted after putting the /shield in place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Eh, I'm not saying that shield hotkey doesn't have its problems... it does.<br />
<br />
i'd like some way to activate in a hotkey the &quot;alternate between last two targets&quot; key... that would solve a lot of the issues.<br />
<br />
However, that kind of shield hotkey is the best one I've found that only takes one hotkey slot, as it's very versatile.<br />
<br />
I don't have room to set up multiple shield hotkeys for each person that might get aggro, and don't want to change them every time the person changes, it's annoying.<br />
<br />
This one is set, and it's done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Smaht</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Do you need to equip a shield to use the shield discipline?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Lorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Nope you dont need a shield.<br />
<br />
/Shield used properly has increase my aggro control a lot.  It's that extra trick to gain that innitial aggro while protecting the slower.<br />
<br />
I also use the /assist  /shield method because it's simple and hasnt failed me yet.  You're targetting the mob the whole time and you want to use shield on the person that mob is targeting.  So when you /assist the mob, you target whomever it's bashing on.  Cleric's use it so why cant we?<br />
<br />
Anyways, Shield has saved many a casters in my exp career.  I usually have shield and taunt up on inc.  If the mob turns toward the slower (or unattentive caster), I usually taunt it.  If that doesnt work I watch his/her health bar.  If they have enough life for a 2nd taunt, I wait for that.  If the 2nd taunt doesnt work, I usually hit my shield button.  Bout 99% of the times the mob turns me to RIGHT after.  <br />
<br />
Very useful Imo.  I guess call it a 3rd taunt but on a 3 min timer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Sangiovese</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">You don't need a shield equipped to use the skill.  If you do have a shield equipped, you take less damage (proportionate to the AC value of the shield).  I can't tell you how much less because I never use it with a shield equipped.<br />
<br />
As for the /shield playername key... it's really the most practical way to use the skill.  How many different people in an exp group do you really need to be ready to shield?  I always set it up for the enchanter if I have one... shammy if I don't have a chanter.  Cleric has multiple DA spells if they are getting smacked, if I cant get aggro back by then, /shield isnt gonna help anyway :)  Nobody else is &quot;essential&quot; enough to need it (and nobody else has an excuse to raw aggro... I'll accept it on a slow (especially a resisted one) but if someone gets aggro from overnuking then they just need to hope my taunt key works or they get a free trip to bind :)<br />
<br />
Using /assist and then shield has the potential to cause too many targetting problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Sangiovese</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">You're targetting the mob the whole time and you want to use shield on the person that mob is targeting. So when you /assist the mob, you target whomever it's bashing on. Cleric's use it so why cant we? <br />
<br />
It is fine for targetting the person you want to shield.  The problem lies in getting BACK on the original mob.  If mobs are stacked together, have the same name, or any other of many things that can make rapid targeting hard to do, you lose valuable time trying to get back on the correct mob.<br />
<br />
And clerics can use it because they don't need to get back on the mob quickly (a lot of them never even target mobs).<br />
<br />
If you just add another /assist to it at the end to try to get back on the mob, you will very likely wind up targetting the player (if they are trying to heal themselves, like a shammy) or the wrong mob (like the add that the chanter is trying to get mezzed... and you just whacked and woke up because you /assisted him).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I map the 'return to last target'  command to a handy button near my hotkey bank...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Fenring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">My /shield hotkey is just /shield (slower). 99% of the time I need to shield someone it's the slower, so when I get in a group I just change the hotkey to fit. If someone other than the slower needs shielding more often than AE taunt pops they need to die in order to learn how to lose aggro or I need another group.<br />
<br />
I did try the /assist../pause../shield.. but I would get messages saying &quot;you must target a living player character to use this ability&quot; about half the time so I went back to my old way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Largic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">^^^Yup... same thing.<br />
<br />
/shield also seems to act as a strong taunt. 90% of the time I shield the slower they turn right back to me.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Smakz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I have one shield hotkey, /assist &lt;slowername&gt;.  If someone other than the slower gets aggro, they better be able to handle it.  Cause they arnt gettnig a shield.<br />

Rogues that can't Evade, Die in my groups.<br />

<br />
and i make it very clear to the cleric, that the only 2 people i will taunt off of is the cleric, and the slower, and only the slower has a hotkey for shield, so the cleric better be able to take a hit long enough for me to type out /shield clericname<br />
<br />
people dont usually have a problem when they get told what to expect.  And to this day, i dont have problems grouping, nor finding a group (well, sometimes i do, when its 6pm on a friday evening or something</div></div><hr />

<br />
Posted by a warrior in my guild.  Please send him the memo!<br />
<br />
I think its amazing how so many of us post that /shield is useful and yet there are so many hold-outs and a lot of mythology around the discipline that just isn't true (i.e., you should have a shield in hand).  I'm not sure what contributes to it except that /shield was introduced so late in the game during a time when there were so many other new bugs and advantaged added that it recieved little fan faire. <br />
<br />
As with others, I never use /assist or shield...I end up getting the damned &quot;target player character...&quot; message.  I set up a shield beforehand for the tashing chanter use that almost exclusively.  I had originally hoped that every other tank in my guild would set up a separate shield key for all the various needy casters but it just hasn't worked out that way.</div></div><hr />

I can type pretty fast and I do save wizards/rogs/ etc by typeing /shield (playername).  but the one that will need it *most* I hotkey.   Remeber that a crit blast isnt a bad player move but it can draw agro.<br />
<br />
It saves lives and I think it draws agro back to you.  This is a matter of dispute but here are some facts.<br />
<br />
If you shield correctly your shieled player will take NO damage even if they are at 1% health.<br />
<br />
You will get all the agro.<br />
<br />
You will save lives.</div></div><hr />

Nuke agro has nothing to do with how much damage the spell does, its hard coded in per spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Well, to be honest i 'd be surprised if /shielding actually means the difference between life and death for the target more than 1 time in 5 -10 but if you've got a skill, you use it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Goradain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">I used it alot back when PoP first came out because slowers tended to panic and slow immediately (often before I even engaged).  Haven't had to use it for a while until...<br />
<br />
Couple days ago grinding in BoT.  New 62 shammie joins the group and is getting resisted out the ass.  He starts trying to slow as soon as I start hitting and if he gets resisted he chain casts it, which means really nasty aggro there.  After his second death I break out /shield on him and tell him he needs to let me take a few hits before he tries to slow (at over 7300 HPs I can take a few hits, even in BoT).  He continues to keep getting aggro (bear in mind I'm using a GSoT at this time and generally have no aggro problems anywhere, although I honestly think my JBoW may hold aggro better - I'll have to figure out how to test them).<br />
<br />
Bottom line is that it will help if you have aggro problems but it's no substitute for just being able to hold aggro.</div></div><hr />

Guess I am fianlly going to have to break down and set up a sheild key...<br />
<br />
What has me scared is that most of my hotkeys have been assinged (and macroed into the fingers) for 3+ years.  Moving attack out of 1 (which I assigned back in 3/99) would probaby be disasterous. Sit is probably a better choice. Its 0,  and probably less dangerous a key to change.</div></div><hr />

The warrior doesn't always have time to sit and taunt a mob 2-3 times so if they jump the caster right after mez is broken, they get shielded by me giving me or another warrior enough time to get aggro and save them to mez/slow the next pull rather than having to get rezed and sit and med.  Overall, I would say the hotkey is worth a slot, I had to drop my evasive hotkey but its not that hard to type /dis evasive when you know the mob is inc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">I have seperate hotkey pages for grouping and raiding, they are both pretty similar but with messages in /group or /guild depending on the page.<br />
<br />
For grouping I have 2 shield hotkeys, one set up as /shield &lt;slower's name&gt; which I use the most, and a 2nd set up as /assist, /pause 1, /shield that doesn't set my target back afterwards.<br />
<br />
For raiding I just have a key set up with /shield as I never know who is going to be beat on and need shielding.  I use F2-6 to target group members, assist mobs when I can see they arent beating on the MT and have enchanters pre-targetted on large pulls.  Most raid nights I would use my shield hotkey a good 10+ times sometimes its not neccessary, but quite often it keeps a cleric or chanter alive until things get under control.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Sarelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">9 = /SHIELD SLOWER<br />
10 = /SHIELD HEALER<br />
<br />
<br />
Precisely what I use, in an exp group.<br />
<br />
In a raid if my job is to tank unmezzable adds then I have a hotkey for the main cc-er. On a pull with mezzable adds and I don't need to offtank something I stand on the mezz-ers back and /shield them if they get aggro.<br />
<br />
Usually I'm MT but I like the relaxation of being an offtank til we get to the names heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Jateki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">I use:<br />
<br />
/assist<br />
<br />
/pause 15 (I've had trouble with lag on occasions)<br />
<br />
/shield<br />
<br />
After I see the /shield message I manually retarget the mob. It works really well and is pretty simple, great time to use it right after you see a summon message. Obviously it's handy on incomings, tash and slows as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Draganetti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">My /assist /shield hotkey works great.  If you are having problems, it's probably due to 3 factors:<br />
<br />
1) Your shielding target is out of range.  (You have to be right next to them.)<br />
<br />
2) The mob has already turned back on you, and you're trying to shield yourself.<br />
<br />
3) you don't have the pauses worked out, so the game thinks you are trying to shield the mob (there is some lag involved with /assisting).<br />
<br />
/assist<br />
/pause 1<br />
/shield<br />
<br />
This has always worked for me.  Remember there is lag involved, so make sure you don't try to target the mob again immediately.  You have to wait for the shield message.  (This is another common error, especially if the /pause is too long.)<br />
<br />
I never really thought to /assist the player at the end to get back on the mob.  I might try that for awhile.  If you don't get the mob back from the /assist, so what?  You'd have to manually target it again anyways.  Actually, the one bad situation I can think of is if you're /assist shielding a shaman, and lets say he's already switched targets to try to slow a second mezed mob (while the first mob is beating on him from his first slow).  That would suck.  Rare though.<br />
<br />
The only times you will have troubles are when there are more than 1 mobs in the camp (on raid or for exp).  If you have to /shield an enchanter who is having mez resists, then your /assist shield isn't gonna work anyways.  I'd just get near him and type out /shield enchanter01 asap.  Now the problem is, you, the MA, no longer have the correct target.  What I usually do is assist another melee in the group to get back on it, if you can't visually tell.  Be very wary of targeting the wrong mob even for a second especially on a raid. . .(if you are MA, if you are not, you should be using shield manually all night long).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">Map the 'switch to last target' key somewhere convenient and avoid any retargetting probs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Draganetti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">I'm not familiar with the &quot;switch to last target&quot; key.  Is this the same as using tab to store targets?  It sounds like a cool thing, will look around for it.  :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">It does exactly what it says it does, toggles betweeen the last two things you targeted.  Works just like tab, but instead of toggling between you and your last target, it's your last two targets.<br />
<br />
It is not mapped to any key by default, so you have to pick one.  I use 'Q' because it's right below my hotkeys and I have heard other people say they do the same.  &quot;~&quot; seems popular too.<br />

I finally had to give up my sit key after enduring years of mocking because I accidentally sat down during a fight because it was between my taunt and bash buttons hehe.  I mapped it to 'S', which I can hit easy because I use 'A' for attack (yes that killed me a few times but I still use it :)), and 'D' for duck.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is shield considered a disc? Upon reaching 55, if I shield will I have to wait 3 mins before going defensive? Will I be unable to shield if I have just used an offensive disc?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Aldarion_Shard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">nope, its not a disc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Tugurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">But you can't /shield while either yourself or the person to be shielded is using a disc. The moment the disc falls, though, you can pop it.</div></div><hr />
