<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ThrokRock</div><div class="date">01-28-2004, 05:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was talking with a friend about guild progression with relation to guild numbers.  The majority of Elemental/time raid guilds(on E'ci) have used more than a standard 72 full raid at least for the first encounter and maybe they can trivialize it after the first win, some do not.  Some may have to continue to use those numbers.<br />
<br />
It may sound like I'm hacking on those sort of players/guilds, but I'm not.  It's a style that suits some people-especially the type of people that want to see the game quickly.  It's also one I wonder if I would've been happy with at times.  Grass is greener?  Maybe.  Maybe not.<br />
<br />
I'm currently in a self proclaimed DIY guild where we want our own wins and the pride of our own accomplishments.  It's been a hard road thus far and we've barely touched on the PoP race where it will be insanely competitive...but we've stayed true to the original vision.  The goal is to have just enough people to do an encounter not a surplus; everyone is important-everyone plays.<br />
<br />
Lately while waiting on a spawn or competing for one against guilds with overwhelmingly more numbers it makes me think if it's worth doing the 'low numbers' thing.<br />
<br />
So I'm wondering what you guys think.  Do you guys think the big volume way is it?  Or would you rather go with just enough or even lower than adequate and get more glory?  Just curious.</div></div><hr />

Sure, will progress slower then a 100 man guild, but.. good luck to that guild in time!</div></div><hr />

You get to experience the encounter not just go through it if that makes sence. Currently getting everyone Emp ssra access so that we can attempt him with our 45ish max raid force. Great thing about smaller guilds is you basically have to advance through each level to get to the next. ie before we really have a chance at some PoP encounters were gunna have to have VT loots. to get VT loots we'll have to have ssra loots ect but we have done some PoP encounters which help us out alot like BoT towers. Smaller guilds &gt; Bigger guilds imo not downing them cuz thats their thing but you get to know everyone in smaller guilds and loot distro is much better making happier people and just generally work better together in my experience.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sadly alot of pop encounters become alot easier when you start throwing numbers at them.<br />
<br />
Sure if you have a 65person guild with the perfect break down of classes then it shouldnt be a problem, but for smaller guild you can get into the situation of not being able to do certain encounters unless you get a full turn out of clerics or a certain number of chanters on.  eg, if an encounter takes a minimum of 10 clerics then a 65 person guild will 11 clerics will have the numbers online less often than a 100 person guild with 20 clerics - assuming your entire guild isnt all online everynight all night.<br />
<br />
I don't think I would describe the advantages of a larger guild to be faster progression as larger guilds are going to have the same number of mobs available to kill to them as a smaller guild assuming the same play time.  Larger guilds are going have to back flag more and raiding will probably be slower to set up, keying up for encounters such as VT and Emp will also take longer, but all this is countered by not having to wait aslong to have the right numbers online / right classes, and once again, several high end PoP encounters are made alot easier with numbers so a larger guild will probably get these encounters behind them with less attempts.</div></div><hr />

Most Big Big Guilds (100+) Equip a tank to solve that problem, Haass. A Tank can be easily equiped starting from Ssra and all the way up to time</div></div><hr />

People used them early in tha game to create &quot;Zerg Rushes&quot; that would overwhelm an opponents defenses with chaep-fast to produce units.  This actually existed in numerous games (C&amp;C etc) before Starcraft but the name &quot;zerg&quot; came to mean in eq:<br />
<br />
1. Guiilds that use alot of people to kill an individual mob<br />
2. Guilds that would res stick people during an encounter to just throw bodies at a boss<br />
3. Guilds that just plain have alot of members<br />
<br />
I've always preferred the term SimCorporation for item 3.  There are CEOs, HR and logistic issues with such massive guilds.  You also get the same reduction in personal respopnsibility, bureacracy and other attributes you find in most large companies. Note: this is not necessarily a derogatory term as yopu also get a deeper resource pool and less dependence on any individual.<br />
<br />
All that being said, I recommend the original poster do what best fits their needs/objectives in the game.  There are pros/cons to both approaches.</div></div><hr />

Aha, and then their tank quits EQ or joins a reputable guild and then the guild disbands and reforms the next week under a different zerg name.<br />

I see how it works now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The thing about big guilds is the availablility of bodies at any given time--I envy a bigger guild for having a raid force loggd on before and after prime-time.  That is the big reason that overall most bigger guilds tend to progress faster--at least I see that in tier one/two as raid level gear is easily self aquired.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ThrokRock</div><div class="date">01-29-2004, 11:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A thing I might add, since the poll is very one-sided towards staying small/(supposedly more organized/easy to manage), is that everything about your guild's attendance/recruiting is so very integral to your success.  <br />
<br />
I have to express my frustration with my own guild's recruiting efforts because it is often slow and there are not many quality/high AA players willing to dog it out from the bottom and opt for flag jumping straight into ubers if possible.  This balance of people(as in 100- + alts) is extremely elusive to find and achieve, but I think it will pay off in the end.  Guilds on E'ci and other servers that are set up this way I hold in high esteem and hope to get to that point of a full raid of regular players...nothing more, nothing less.</div></div><hr />

One of our elemental level guilds formed very recently (Test of Time) and two elemental guilds (Crimson Blade and United Kingdoms) have lost almost all their power overnight due to a few key members disbanding.<br />
<br />
In addition, we have a force of server outcasts that call themselves &quot;bb raiders&quot; that run around, zerging down any pre elemental god that shows up with 100+ people.<br />
<br />
So yeah.  They do form, and fall, very quickly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">01-30-2004, 01:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been in both.  <br />
<br />
I was in a guild called Forge of Ro for several months with the absolute finest EQ players I have ever played with.  Loot was aplenty as there were only about 40 total to equip.  The problem was, we couldn't do many encounters because we:<br />
<br />
1)  Didn't have enough numbers on at one time.<br />
2)  Didn't have enough numbers period (PoP content).<br />
<br />
The guild had class though and I enjoyed every single damn bit of it.  Victory was placed on the backs of the individual and it was an awesome feeling of accomplishment when you won.  Some of my best EQ experiences were in this guild.<br />
<br />
I'm now in a guild that raids with 60-70 called Veneration X.  This does, indeed, have several advantages.  For one, you usually don't have to worry about not enough people showing up.  Even if just over half the guild signs on Friday night, that's still 40ish to raid with to go off Emperor Ssraeshza, for example.  Two, it is true, you can plow through PoP content.  This doesn't mean everyone can jack off as they please, as PoP encounters aren't really designed to allow that, but it does keep morale high when you kill MM one week and RZ two weeks later.  There are some disadvantages though.<br />
<br />
1)  The individual sees less loot because, quite simply, there are tons more people to equip.<br />
2)  Takes fawking forever to get everyone backflagged.  :p<br />
3)  Takes a long time getting people keyed for events such as Emp and VT.<br />
<br />
As far as us Warriors go, the primary tank in the guild I'm in now came from an elemental guild.  While he wears no Raex, he's quite well equipped with VT gear and a few non-Raex elemental pieces.  He's a hella solid tank and a damn fine player.<br />
<br />
I'm happy and have enjoyed the experiences of both.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the guild im in recruited our PoP force before we hit ssra. getting close to sol ro tower, was funny when we threw 60 people at arch lich rhag'zhadune the other day right after we got rydda'dar to 23%</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">01-31-2004, 02:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Funny thing is, most of the top guilds started out with considerably fewer numbers before PoP. They recruited out of necessity and are now faced with 100+ rosters. Eventually, you hit an artificial ceiling that a 50 man guild just cannot progress through unless they have 100% attendance from their members and a seriously disproportionate amount of clerics.</div></div><hr />

One Brothers of Darkness, A Nameless zerg community, where they throw numbers at something to kill it. <br />
Take LMM for example, they threw 97 people at him 3 times and only by a miracle on the 3rd attempt one.<br />
<br />
That was my old guild I left half a year ago.<br />
Im in Decade now, We did LMM with 55 and won on our first attempt. It took us a few tries (3) on RZtW But we droped him, With less numbers then what we orginal started at (first attempt full 72 second 68, third attempt 65) <br />
<br />
We do more with less, Decade has before i got their, and we will do more now with me here, In our guild (100 member roster only because of 20, 65 alts) We do more with less, and more memebers prosper. <br />
<br />
Just a side note, when I left BoD their roster was 480 <br />
<br />
Zerg guilds may get there, But they weont equip there 400 before all 100 of us (including alts) are geared up.<br />
(PS. Our alts only are allowed to get gear that may rot. So nothing new ever goes to a alt. )<br />

Plus, guilds higher up the food chain have been known to actively target and recruit those players.  Which in turn serves two purposes 1) Getting a recruit thats nicely equipped and most likely a decent player 2) Slows down that guild a fair bit.<br />

There is a fair amount of trust happening when a guild outfits one character.</div></div><hr />

Judging from the ammount of bottomfeeding I see happening to members of my guild i'd say all the tops do it, and do it actively. My alt has been asked twice already.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And let me tell you, for the utter exhiliration of the win, for the feeling that you actually contributed something, for the knowledge that you are growing (and winning) together, nothing beats a smaller, raiding guild. Are we recruiting? Like crazy. Do we accept just anyone? Heck no. We have strict policy's for recruiting for a reason, and the number one reason is so we do not become a zerg guild. We allow Alts in, so our guild list is a little inflated, but every alt is the alt of a dedicated and QUALITY individual. We may only have one cleric main ATM, but we have done things that many guilds in our same position can only wish to do.<br />
<br />
I have friends in other guilds who tell me their guild wipes with 20+ people on an encounter we have done with 7 (well, 6, the person who spawned the encounter went down from overnuking - silly druid~!)<br />
<br />
Accomplishing something, and knowing that you played a part in it, and not just being one of 50 melees smacking a mob. All this is what makes me proud to be the Leader of The Light Warriors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Poohjure</div><div class="date">02-04-2004, 08:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, as a member of the Eci &quot;Zerg force&quot; as some have come to call it, I honestly do not feel that the number of people that you use should matter.  We raid 6-7 days a week for 10-12 hours a day and have people show up of all types of of all skill levels, wanting to do what everyone does when they hit level 65, Raid.  <br />
<br />
And why turn away someone that is dedicated enough to come support a raid?  Of course if you look at our dkp site you will see some numbers that some call &quot;Outragous&quot;.  I personally look at it as excercising the potential of the Public force and making sure no flags are wasted.<br />

With regards to?  <br />
<br />
<br />
large guilds and their doings :D<br />
<br />
sure; some do work well; but for the most part i'd wager most 150+ member guilds are there purely for the zerg factor ( keep throwing bodies at things it's bound to fall down ) ... plus interaction between the guildmates becomes lost in the spam...and little niches and cliques are formed and....well, it's just a machine with no personality.<br />
<br />
I'm a fan of the smaller, quality guilds. Sure; in the end the overall l33tness isn't there but the accomplishments are more rearding IMHO.<br />
<br />
Ask Hussar. His guild isn't one of the biggest on TT but the list of accomplishments is pretty impressive considering the numbers of people attending. Plus you know them too. you know everyone. <br />
<br />
I dunno. Personally I left a 150 member time enabled guild to go back to a smaller guild just because of the overall feelings of being just a number rather than who I am as a person. But that's just a personal thing. I don't hold any gripes towards my old guildmates; but it just wasn't me.</div></div><hr />
