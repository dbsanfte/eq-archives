<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Stupid forum won't let me post on the warrior changes thread so stuff it, posting a new thread as continuation.<br />
<br />

 Doggabone arf arf<br />
<br />
To my recollection, the provoke line is on one timer. Given that as an assumption, I would probably Belittle one on INC, switch to the other critter while whatever CC the group is using gets used on the Belittle'd. This should give me time to establish aggro before the non-melee are on the MOB that I'm on. (Without a Provoke, I have been ablo to hold aggro on the first engage of a double MOB almost every single time - I can't remember exceptions but I assume there have been some. But the second has often been difficult.) Wait for clean up heals and slows and such, taunt the CC'd add (if there's time) until I know I've succeeded, then Belittle for a leg up on aggro and engage. <br />
<br />
Frodlin7th Yeah,<br />
<br />
I love the hate dot aspect of it. As other were saying, I'll end up belittiling the one I dont' intend to tank, and tankt he one the &quot;old fashined way&quot;. If stuff goes bad, I save the belittle for the add and use AE taunt/rampage judiciously. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Huh? So now we're using provoke on an add (or are required to switch targets) the issues many warriors had with tanking 'the old fashioned way' have miraculously disappeared? <br />
<br />
As mentioned in my example above (now in the other thread), I'm not the most under equipped of warriors, I was holding aggro 'ok' with the wizard's cooperation, he never got hit, but he still disliked grouping with a warrior.<br />
<br />
I was under the impression that the entire reason we campaigned for a provoke like skill was to allow warriors to perform their pure tank role with both similar power AND flexibility to that afforded by knights. Whilst it may well be ok for elemental planar/BoW wielding/anger3/Aetaunting/AA's-out-the-arse-and-therefore-rampaging Warriors to use the Provoke skill as a back up ability whilst tanking 'the old fashioned way' what about the folks who DON'T have access to all the bells and whistles who have enough trouble just keeping ONE mob under control to the casters satisfaction? <br />
<br />
I was under the impression we all felt that for balance to exist ANY warrior should have access to the abilities needed to perform acceptably in his role. Straight jacketted aggro does NOT sit well with the flexibilty I consider as being neccessary to make a good tank class.<br />
<br />
Guess anyone who doesn't find mob control so trivially easy to provide to their casters better hope the aggro disc's not as crap as you believe it'll be Frodlin?<br />
<br />
Please answer the question as well. What is the issue with a non-stacking, multiple use provoke skill that makes the idea too 'overpowering' and/or less desirable than the current configuration? <br />
<br />
I'll note in case it wasn't clear that one of the key reasons I brought up Furor's DoT idea was that you stated how attractive you found the idea of affecting multiple targets at once.<br />
<br />
bloody forum, I phrased this better the last few times :p<br />

<br />
Uhh, no Valeris, different scenarios require different strategies.  It could hardly be argued that tanking multiple live mobs is the &quot;norm&quot;, the &quot;norm&quot; would be pulling either a single mob or one with mezzable adds, inciting the one that will stay live, and using your newfound aggro generation PLUS your standard bag of tricks to keep aggro remarkably better on the single mob.   When something changes though and you have to compensate, you have to change strats a bit.  I can now effectively tank 2 mobs at the same time while beating on one if I use the appropriate strategies, and this is something NEVER doable before, EVER.   Prior, we had AE Taunt, which worked until the first heal landed, then it was a death sentence to your cleric.    <br />
<br />
I like the idea of being able to choose how I allocate my skills and not being restricted to focusing on a single mob.   I like the idea of having provoke useful both for single tanking as well as multi tanking.  I like having slice as an opening skill to generate more numerical hatred, I like a LOT of things in this system, but choice and being able to differentiate between a skilled warrior and an unskilled one is clearly my favorite.<br />
<br />
As mentioned in my example above (now in the other thread), I'm not the most under equipped of warriors, I was holding aggro 'ok' with the wizard's cooperation, he never got hit, but he still disliked grouping with a warrior.<br />
<br />
But you'll be able to hold aggro better with the changes.  Comparing post changes with what a wizard said while in your current crippled state is unrealistic.<br />

<br />
And that was a good impression to be under, but you're not trading AE taunt, and taunt for provoke, you're adding it, you're adding an entire dimension to your ability set and losing nothing (well, perhaps sacrificing some refresh on evasive).   <br />
<br />
Guess anyone who doesn't find mob control so trivially easy to provide to their casters better hope the aggro disc's not as crap as you believe it'll be Frodlin?<br />
<br />
No, the thing is I've seen the skills in use and they're quite powerful aggro generators, I've compared them against paladin stuns and as i said, you'd be surprised at how nicely they'll perform.  I still hate the aggro disc, but that's me, some people may like it for all I know.<br />
<br />
Please answer the question as well. What is the issue with a non-stacking, multiple use provoke skill that makes the idea too 'overpowering' and/or less desirable than the current configuration? <br />
<br />
Well, considering they're non fizzlable, non interruptable, you can use them while moving, they have a nice range, they're aggro dots, and have a fairly minimal endurance cost at this point, i'd say a 30 second wait time is totally in line.  On top of that, the dot lasts twice as long as the refresh on it, it can ALREADY be reused before it's through, I simply dont' see adding more as being productive in any way.<br />

Not with a Knight, he just shrugs his shoulders and casts another stun or two. <br />
<br />
But you'll be able to hold aggro better with the changes. Comparing post changes with what a wizard said while in your current crippled state is unrealistic. If I'm using provoke on an add what are these other changes I have on demand that'll allow me to hold aggro better than in my current 'crippled state' -  to use your descriptor. Fellstrike?<br />
<br />
the thing is I've seen the skills in use and they're quite powerful aggro generators.<br />
<br />
Which skills are we talking about here? Apart from provoke cause you already used it to keep the casters happily nuking away and  can't use that for another 30 seconds :p Provoke looks like being great, when you can use it.<br />
<br />
 Well, considering they're non fizzlable, non interruptable, you can use them while moving, they have a nice range, they're aggro dots, and have a fairly minimal endurance cost at this point, i'd say a 30 second wait time is totally in line. <br />
<br />
All that is quite true but IN PRACTISE how much is that going to affect peoples opinions of knights vs. warriors? Heck, the main reason it doesn't fizzle is the reuse time :p, approx 85% of the time spells don't fizzle/get interupted and even if they do they can recast in a couple of seconds, they have better range also since we're listing all benefits of provoke and a not overly onerous mana cost to here the pallies talk /shrug  I'd say most people wouldn't care all that much either way since both methods do the job with 'relative' ease.<br />
 <br />
However any time the necro/wizard who's relying on warrior hate skill to let him do his job goes without it, bang. Same old problem, especially when he's 'expecting' good aggro control. Whilst it'll be less common it will remain a noticeable issue, people remember the times things don't work far more than the times everything works ok, that's what got us into this mess eh?.<br />
<br />
You throw out AE Taunt again casually, how many 45-60th level warriors have AETaunt? Hell, I haven't got AEtaunt yet. Aetaunt is supposed to be a supplimentary skill not part of the classes basic skill set, that's why it's an AA isn't it? <br />
<br />
Provoke however, is supposed to be the meaty class fix for aggro comparisons is it not? it's the only non-opening related, non-random aggro skill I'm aware of (apart from that disc).<br />
<br />
It only fixes the class 'some of the time' - so long as you don't have adds to deal with or the enchanter doesn't mezz/pet your target, so long as an unmezzable add doesn't appear mid fight, so long as you have something better than your healer druid rooting as CC and a new add doesn't need to be neutralised RIGHT NOW. <br />
<br />
If aggro flexibility's good enough for knights when tanking then it's good enough for warriors, and by all means balance endurance costs etc to take into account the new paradigm. You'll note also I didn't reduce the reuse time to instant in my 'proposal', i threw out 10 seconds as an example of a more flexible whilst still not instantly available skill. Heck if i get stunned don't let me 'cast' it, that seems fair. <br />
<br />
30 seconds can be a long time in a fight. I just don't like that sort of artificial, arbitrary limiter in a situation with so many random elements and I'm damn sure it will get noticed by the people we want to group with us. Tinker with it as much as you like once I can use it more flexibly and I won't mind so long as it does the basic job (snap aggro) with similar efficiency to a knight, because that's what the other people in my group are gonna really notice, not the fine nuances...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I like the direction of the changes, this issue bugs the hell out of me though and I don't see why it shouldn't be addressed in a more satisfactory fashion. heck give me a high endurance cost,  fast reuse, non- hate dotting aggro boost that fizzles based on taunt skill and greys out the provoke timer for 10 -15 seconds if you prefer :p.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Since many of your points are more or less &quot;preferences&quot;, I'm gonna leave em as merely a difference of opinion.   I'll say that your group carries a responsibility though and in light of these changes, they are 'responsible&quot; for CC or limiting pulls to what the group is able to handle.   If a wizard is bitching because he stands there and nukes an uncontrolled mob, then the wizard needs to be pointed to the nearest exit or handed a book on how to play Everquest.   If he's not rooting the mob away from you then he's an idiot and you can tell him I said so.  <br />
<br />
Now, there IS one thing that is a substantive issue that you raise, and I'd like to address that.<br />
<br />
All that is quite true but IN PRACTISE how much is that going to affect peoples opinions of knights vs. warriors? <br />
<br />
This is simple.... in practice, it will be affected by the following factors... <br />
<br />
1. How skillfully warriors play with these new changes.   The ability to dramatically change the game for the better is there, you have been given the tools, now it's up to you to use them.<br />
<br />
2. How much whining and moaning both publicly and privately you do.   If you talk about &quot;worthless changes&quot; while in your groups, then you set the mindset of the people you play with as you being worthless.   While it's CURRENTLY true, with these changes, it is no longer true.   The choice on what to do with what you've been given is now yours to make.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">worthless changes <br />
If the changes improve the game and make it more fun to play, then that's wonderful, and we should say so publically and thank the designers and developers.<br />
<br />
However if there are problems that materially affect your ability to enjoy using this product, then you should say so. Sometimes companies change things because customers are disatisfied. If you are alone in this criticism, however, then you might have a choice to make.<br />
<br />
SoE went to this expence to achieve greater customer satisfaction. Designers (I have been one) have strong convictions, but successful designers have strong convictions that are correct. The marketplace, not the designer, decides.<br />
<br />
In the end, this is an entertainment product. Even if they did not do it &quot;right&quot; if you have fun playing then they have succeeded.<br />
<br />
Frodlin can tell you that Warriors now have a wonderful opprotunity to use skill to obtain aggro. I can that this is just a convenient coverstory for an inelegant design -  Paladins don't need this hodgepodge to get aggro, Neither satements mean jack. We are not you. <br />
<br />
The Bandwagon Effect is often used by marketers and propagandists to shape opinion (and so are loaded words like whine and worthless). I'd prefer that you didn't get on board and that you made up your own minds.<br />

<br />
Ditto ... all of that.  Battleblade esp.<br />
<br />
I was quoted, so - - fwiw, here's some stuffs.  I think I was quoted as an case in point, not to be directly rebutted.  (Nevertheless, I've been tapping at this response between camp spawns, so I'ma post it. Nyah!)<br />
<br />
Someone said summat about diff. levels of Provoke being on different refreshes, as different levels of stun spells are.  And so I posited a tactic for the single timer Provoke line.  Is it gonna be the right approach?  Iono, I'm still figgering stuff out.  But with a single timer Provoke on it's currently proposed set-up, it's what I'm likely to do.  If it's shorter, I may tweak that but not by much.  I neither approve nor disapprove of the timer that's proposed, I'm gonna make do with the one I get.   Aggro has never been trivial and I'm often feeling helpless about it, but I have a blast most nights.  <br />
<br />
I'm looking at a toolset which I see to be a vast improvement over my current one, and am pleased with it.  Mebbe it won't be enough - but it'll be more than I have.  I'll make it work.  For my money the approach I described looks to me to be a vast improvement over the old, and the old was very often viable (but not idiot proof!).  I am very excited about the tweaks, which should be apparent to anyone.<br />
<br />
I don't have an answer about what is better or worse, or balanced or not; timers and stacking and such.  But if the rumours I read about spell aggro being tweaked in the future, it may come to be that the knight approach to aggroing multiple mobs will be very close to the limits we'll be facing.  Maybe not.<br />
<br />
One of the things these boards have shown me is how to make the most with what I've got ... all I was trying to say was how I imagined myself working with a tool I was going to get.</div></div><hr />

I never said and never would make such a foolish statement as that these changes are 'worthless'. It appears that Frodlin wants to put words in my mouth since I refuse to consider the provoke skill in the same light as the second coming of Jesus Christ.<br />
<br />
Furthermore I resent the clear implication by 'his Frodlinness' that anyone inclined to post reservations to this thread is 'whining' or that I winge in my groups incessantly about my aggro skills. That is not the case. <br />
<br />
Frankly, I expected better of him, not a Brik the Shadowknight bit of Trollery.<br />
<br />
/rant off<br />
<br />
Just by the by, the (mis-)quoted section that Frodlin appears to believe was a complaint  about the 'worthlessness' of the skill was actually pointing out that in practise I didn't see how more flexibility, despite those plus points mentioned by Frodlin, would materially disadvantage the knight classes (since both ways would work similarly enough that group members would have no real 'choice' to make) and therefore I didn't feel such an idea was particularly unbalanced, nor putting knights out of work.<br />
<br />
:rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Bah,<br />
Hopefully my concerns are unfounded. It will certainly be  interesting to see what design assumptions are used when the designers retune knight spell aggro.</div></div><hr />

You know what fucking infuriates me Valeris, is when you misquote ME in a god damned rant about me misquoting YOU.<br />
<br />
Did I fucking SAY that you were calling anything worthless?  No, I didn't.    I fucking said.... that IF you called something worthless that your current potential groupmates would begin to see things in that light.<br />
<br />
I didn't even imply that you WOULD, any more than I said you'd be a crappy player when I said that it was up to how skillfully you used these changes, now learn how to fucking read what is written rather than what the fuck you want to read.    <br />
<br />
The martyrdom thing doens't work with you when you are the one misquoting.<br />
<br />
See, there's people who make god damned assumptions based on what they hear 3rd hand from other people (read: You, Battleblade, and Heimdall), then come here to complain about them without ANY fucking first hand knowledge, even having facts 100% fucked up (in the case of Heimdall).  Then there's those who devote some time to actually trying this shit out, people who have been on your fucking side for the last 2 god damned years who tell you FIRST hand what is in store and you prefer to take the &quot;woe is me&quot; approach because you've gotten comfortable in it.   You'd fucking think that as much as I've sung the warrior line, and even argued against those like Phantron on this VERY issue that the provoke line is balanced and not TOO much, that you'd at least give me the benefit of the doubt, but no, you would rather misquote me, act offended and continue on your little crusade which has no stated aim, and no stated end goal.<br />
<br />
I EVEN in the SAME FUCKING POST that there were certain things that were a matter of preference that I wouldn't confront you on, because they were a matter of preferences, and it's stupid arguing preferences, and yet you STILL act like I am telling you you can't have preferences.<br />

I can't see a great deal of point in attempting to check out the skill when the max level I can get test buffed is 25, which is why I posted my concerns here for the perusal of one of the more knowledgeable warriors out there to clear up for me, you yourself have stated that you'd LIKE to actually try this ability in a group situation but as far as I'm aware that still hasn't happened, or hasn't been mentioned on the boards? <br />
<br />
Rightly or wrongly I didn't think your feedback was very 'lucid' and glossed over things to some extent therefore I continued to point out where what you were saying didn't add up to a complete answer (and yep i get a bit dogmatic unfortunately when trying to make a point, especially if it appears to me that it's being sidestepped).<br />

Here's some quality speculation based on the hard knowledge we've been given about the mitigation change:<br />
Here (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=4713&amp;perpage=15&amp;display=&amp;pagenumber=6) Glance at post #89.<br />
<br />
Third rate knowledge? Yep. I have not been the one here with special access to the developers. But I think it's reasoned criticisim and not a mindless &quot;THis R teh SuKE&quot; or 'These changes will end hunger and misery throughout the known universe.&quot;<br />
<br />
Several people have criticized the 30 resuse timer for the Provoke line. I criticize it and you said AE Taunt (that has a fast reuse timer doesn't it? Yeah, right) and our other aggro abilities covered it. Valaris criticized it and you shruged it off and called it &quot;preference&quot;. He persisted and you flamed him.<br />
<br />
Guess what? The 30 second reuse timer is a LOT slower than you can respond with a stun as a Paladin. Therefore it IS going to behave differently in-game. You may like those differences and others may be concerned.<br />
<br />
Gushing praise at every single thing in this set of changes does not help Warriors at all. Neither does blind condemnation.<br />
<br />
Now with your inside knowledge if you want to explain the mitigation change go ahead - there's a thread where you could grant us this boon. I gave it my best shot with my third-hand knowledge.<br />
<br />
Valeris and I (and anyone else) are entitled to criticize these changes. If you don't like it, don't read our posts. In the meantime, forget you know my toon's name when flaming others. <br />
<br />
I would not flame Absor and say he sounded just like Frodlin (sorry Absor).<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>slyse</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The 30 second reuse timer is a LOT slower than you can respond with a stun as a Paladin<br />
<br />
It's slower than you can ~chain~ stuns with a paladin.  The provoke line enables you to respond faster than paladins with stuns (albeit not much faster) since provoke has zero cast time.  The whole idea behind the hate dot in addition to the initial aggro is so there's no need to chain.<br />
<br />
Also, AE taunt's reuse timer is about right, imo.  It's not something you need every pull unless you're in a group you shouldn't be in, and it's reusable fast enough to have it handy in most cases when you really need it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I understand that, but thanks.<br />
<br />
If I use Provoke and while the reuse timer is counting back, I can't respond to seeing &quot;Chanter is hit for 305 hitpoints.&quot; as well as a Paladin. I can't respond as well in general to 4 or 5 mobs hitting camp. I don't have a fast &quot;on-demand&quot; ranged aggro tool or Root. Except of course AE Taunt, but that's got a slow reuse timer too.<br />
<br />
Now maybe that is in-line with the Paladin Combat Medic/Tank/CC concept and Provoke with it's better (I'm guessing) ability to hold aggro on a single-mob is more inline with the Beef/Tank vision of Warriors.<br />
<br />
Players might have to play differently when a Warrior MT's but instead of rejecting as they have been doing, accept it because we have other plusses with the changes.<br />
<br />
But when I follow up on that line of thinking by noting that Paladins have closed the Warrior HP advantage and the mitigation change may not make us beefier against low DI experiance mobs and does nothing vs. DD, DoT, and procs from high-level boss mobs, I get told that more Warrior HP's would break the game and, predictably, that the mitigation change is better.<br />
<br />
And I'm told not to focus on what the changes do individually (ranged aggro every 30 seconds, melee damage only high DI mob mitigation, and dancing star power-ups) but to look at the total package.<br />
<br />
Perversely, Paladins get told Cease and Desist shouldn't be nerfed because Warriors have a fast (except for reuse) no-mana ranged aggro tool now. Maybe they should look at the total package, neh? Oh, my mistake - the authoritative opinion has been provided.<br />
<br />
And Valaris gets flamed.<br />
<br />
I guess I should read books for recreation and leave these discussions for the very very small minority that have ALL the answers and believe that having concerns is out of line and will just make players unhappy. &quot;Resistance is useless.&quot;<br />

<br />
First:<br />
<br />
Read this, and pay close attention to the bolded part.<br />
<br />
Since there was so much assumption and not enough fact surrounding the aggro relationship between warriors and knights with the new skills, I decided to go ahead and test it myself.<br />
<br />
All I can say is you'll be surprised at how warriors stack up to knights with the new skills. I'd call it &quot;balanced&quot; even.<br />
<br />
I used a 55 Paladin<br />
Raaj used a 65 warrior with Raex BP<br />
<br />
If I pulled with Cease, he'd get aggro with 2 berates (no attacking)<br />
<br />
If he pulled with berate, it took me 4 cease/stuns to get the mob off.<br />
<br />
When using Spirit of Rage + Raex + 2 berates, it took 8 stuns to get the mob off of him and aggro was still wormy.<br />
<br />
If I pulled and meleed, I kept aggro with cease/stun.<br />
<br />
I held no commanding advantage over him like I would in today's EQ.<br />
<br />
Are you telling me that paladins need 4 cease/stuns to keep a mob off of an enchanter and that those 4 cease/stuns (with approx 2.5 sec cast time and 2.5 sec spell refresh each, making 20 seconds worth of casting without fizzles or interrupts and if they're cast the second the spell refreshes) are killing chanters?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">All Knights get something like a 45% detrimental spell haste and cease is only 1.5 seconds, but even if it's 1 second to cast, that's still 3.5 second after recast time.  I personally have never seen it took more than one stun (especially if it's Akilae since it actually stuns them) for a Paladin to get anything off in a realistic XP situation.  I mean yeah if you chain tash something it'd take more than one stun but who does that anyway?</div></div><hr />

<br />
As I see the Provoke line, I see a great tool for incoming mobs, the amount generated by berate (or the higher one) is higher than shaman slow (with 1 anger II proc is enough, and that is 400 hate), and on top of that, you are meeling, so you have your procs too, (I never tested it) but I assume is higher than chanter tash, hence, it should be ok with chanter slow, AND on top of that, you have your taunt, so you taunt when slow/tash lands. Right now, in adventure groups, my only problem is with Necros super-stacking dots (I lose it to them), or slow at the beginning. And I see this ability will help me on both scenarios. As far as tanking 2 mobs at the same time, Ive done it perfectly without this ability, so I just guess it will just help me more (A key to switch targets and a timed Taunt are just fine to tank 2 mobs). And Im not a uber warrior (check my magelo), I dont weild any EB weapons, I just put all my effort on making groups happy and play the best I can. <br />
I agree with Frodliin when he says that all these things are adding to my toolset, that I will be able to do the things I do now, better. Again, I didnt test it, thats why I prefer not make an opinion still, I will just assume, from reading other testers, that is good (just by looking at the numbers, it seems good). And the openings thingy looks like a fun toy, and in the end, a game is for fun, right? And unhooked disciplines, imo this is great too, cant wait to actually be able to use more than 1, or use offensive ones and not having to &quot;save it&quot; in case defensive is gonna be used, or just chain em (Spirit of Rage, Furious, Stonewall comes to my mind). Is a matter of preference, as far as me goes, I see all this as good stuff, and Im pretty sure it will enhance my flexibility in many situations :)</div></div><hr />

If I didnt' have access to the higher level skills, guess what I'd be doing...<br />
<br />
I'd be on test, I'd /testbuff an enchanter, a shaman, a paladin and a SK, and I'd test to the extent that the environment allowed me to.   I would do this before EVER commenting, because it would add to my credibility.   I wouldn't begin my argument with &quot;Why test when there's a limit to the test?&quot; simply because that would make me look lazy and prone to pessimism.   <br />
<br />
Battleblade in specific, you've taken several potshots at me that I'm not going to let stand any more.<br />
<br />
Several people have criticized the 30 resuse timer for the Provoke line. I criticize it and you said AE Taunt (that has a fast reuse timer doesn't it? Yeah, right) and our other aggro abilities covered it. Valaris criticized it and you shruged it off and called it &quot;preference&quot;. He persisted and you flamed him.<br />
<br />
Several people?  There's been 3 to my knowledge, all 3 haven't bothered taking even the first step toward presenting a credible argument, which is the collection of data.   I flamed him not for persisting, you are again showing an amazing inability to pereive the obvious.   I flamed him for misquoting me while flaming me for misquoting him, which I did not do, the flame had *nothing* to do with disagreeing with the reuse timer on provoke.<br />
<br />
I have not been the one here with special access to the developers.<br />
<br />
Nor have I, I have simply tested the skills and given feedback, just like anyone else.   As a matter of fact, I am one of the few on the beta server who doesn't have the special &quot;beta buff&quot;, because I'm not often on when the devs are.    Not having &quot;special access to the developers&quot; doesnt' stop anyone from doing anything insofar as testing is concerned.<br />
<br />
And as for your little edited out &quot;zinger&quot; about my view on Cease/Desist and their need to be &quot;nerfed&quot; on the PoN boards, let me be as straightforward as humanly possible....<br />
<br />
Because we received a skill which is in essence a 'free aggro generator' from a range which serves no other purpose than to generate aggro, which albeit is on a longer refresh, I dont' feel that Cease and Desist (or Stun/Holy Might) should have their aggro adjusted any longer, or if they do, then similar spells which DO affect mobs 55+ should be implemented into the game.   Paladins play this game too, and they don't deserve to sit on the sidelines and watch us get improved to the point of being able to acheive what was previously unattainable, and then lose that ability themselves as well.   That is spitefulness and that is unfair.</div></div><hr />

It may be that with KEI alone the cost of casting level appropriate spells to acquire aggro is not too onerous. Many Paladins themselves feel stuns should be looked at.

The provoke line serves two functions.  First it gives a boost of initial aggro, then it gives an aggro dot.  That dot allows others to do stuff around you while you're still generating aggro while beating on a totally different mob, something mind you that no other class can do without breaking a mez.  Even a successful taunt won't get aggro off of you from this if you're on top of hate list.  15 seconds doesn't allow you to even give the dot a chance to work, and since it's an integral part of the line, it wouldn't be &quot;overpowered&quot;, just silly.   <br />

<br />
The thing is, there were two possible ways to fix this issue.   First would be to make knights have more warriorlike aggro by removing the hate from many commonly used spells, the second was to improve warriors.   What I didn't see as an option was an inversion where you did both.   You seem to be arguing that this is appropriate.  Also, stun doesn't affect mobs and it's just about as low in terms of mana as anything else (35 mana is hardly gonna kill anyone, especially since if you interchange casting with using a DW bracer), why the focus on cease/desist but not on stun?<br />

Ok you all realize that paladin, sk free cost aggro is going to end right?  you can expect a &quot;nerf&quot; to the lower cost abilities, and therefore your scenerio's are not exactly well thought out.  Puller brings in 5 mobs, paly tries to aggro them all with stuns but because he was MT he goes OOM by the 3rd mob and the group goes spatt.<br />
<br />
I like the look of the provoke line, and no i don;t give a rip if it's on a 15 sec or 30 sec reuse time.  I don;t want a Paly stun spell with a new name  . . . thanks but no thanks.  I do think this is getting comical, because if you let BB in charge of the &quot;balancing&quot; we would be paladin's with different names for our &quot;spells&quot;.  The changes should be good, and you know what if they suck at least the developers and adjust them.  Please continue to knock the provoke line all you want, maybe the fix will be an insta cast Paly doppleganger spell, then all your problems will be solved!</div></div><hr />

All this bs new system is coming from the same mentality out there of maximising their game time. Like picking group members based on dps. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Well perhaps I haven't been sufficiently clear.<br />
<br />
I think survivability and aggro control are fundamental tanking attributes.<br />
<br />
What I would like to see is all tank classes have equivilant aggro control. It's fine if this is reached by different means. Warriors, Paladins, and SK's should not all play exactly the same and have a button marked &quot;Aggro&quot;. Groups should not care based on aggro control who tanks.<br />
<br />
You believe (and you've done some testing) that this state of aggro equivilence has been reached.<br />
<br />
I'm sceptical. I raise questions not because I'm an idiot, but because the functionality doesn't look like it will put us in the same place to me.<br />
<br />
You were unconcerned, but I and probably &quot;several&quot; others were concerned and we said so.<br />
<br />
Anyone will tell you step #1 is to validate people's concerns - &quot;I understand why you are concerned. If I thought that, I would be concerned too. What were thse concerns again? Maybe after release you can post if you still have these concerns we can discuss them.....&quot;<br />
<br />
I absolutely don't want Warriors overpowered. But I don't want to hear anybody Obi Wan warriors again -  &quot;These are not the imbalances you are looking for.&quot;<br />
<br />
BB<br />
&quot;The classes are not that out of balance.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Not getting into the flames again with you Frodlin but again you're 'favouring' you viewpoint a bit here. I did state quite clearly as has Bb and others that an integral part of balancing (versus the reduced timer that i would like to see) would probably have to be that the skill would NOT overwrite when cast by the 'same' warrior (similar to the way DoT's stack at this time) or yes indeed it'd be unbalanced. If flexibility would mean my aggro was overpowered versus a knight I've already stated that I would prefer it to be balanced downward to suit. <br />
<br />
I really don't see the hate DoT as much more than gravy anyway so why it has to be an issue when looking at the number of mobs it can be applied to I'm not sure. Especially given your previous championing of a similar scenario with Furor's DoT idea's. This seems like quibbling about the semantics (like when you argued the low endurance cost prevented it from being possible -  the endurance cost can be changed, everything about the skill could be changed if it was felt neccessary :p)<br />
<br />
The DoT, it strikes me, is meant more to 'help' those lower level warriors that have aggro generation problems with the mob they're tanking during the fight, moreso than as an offtanking tool (although that's a great secondary useage when you're AA'd, EB'd and Angered to the point using it on your target isn't 'neccessary').<br />
<br />
I have no confidence that the group dynamic (especially the Hate values, DPs outputs etc) at level 25 is anything like an accurate mirror for the situation 40 levels later therefore I certainly wouldn't trust any results thereby gained. Not to mention I'm in the wrong timezone for when most testers are likely to be online and that small problem known as RL.<br />
<br />
 You'll note i've confined my commentary here to the 30 second recast - i don't think it's really all that neccessary to go to test  when the value I'm trying to quantify can be extrapolated from re-examining any and all of my previous group experiences of times when a secondary aggro boost would have been welcome within that 30 seconds, or that after initial contact (and the snap aggro we desire) I have needed to alter my emphasis to a different mob etc etc. None of which examples you chose to address because, or so it appeared to me, there was no way to address them without admitting that it was a 'relative weakness' of the skill.  So instead of treating the query with some level of even handedness, you just brushed it off. <br />
<br />
Had you been less intentionally obtuse then none of the flaming would have occurred. <br />
<br />
But whatever. Hopefully I am wrong to be concerned, it'd be cold comfort to be 'right' :p.<br />

And you're right.   One cannot have one without the other, as trhe last year and a half has shown us.<br />
<br />
What I would like to see is all tank classes have equivilant aggro control. It's fine if this is reached by different means. Warriors, Paladins, and SK's should not all play exactly the same and have a button marked &quot;Aggro&quot;. Groups should not care based on aggro control who tanks.<br />
<br />
See, this is probably where we separate.  I don't care if I have equivalent aggro, as long as I have sufficent aggro that my presence is not a danger to a group or more costly to a group.  They can have aggro up the wazoo for all I care, as long as mine is enough to not cause others to have to alter downwards their play when grouped with me.<br />
<br />
You believe (and you've done some testing) that this state of aggro equivilence has been reached.<br />
<br />
Well... it's a little more complicated than that.   I think that with the changes, our class is significantly better off than it has been.   We have a great number of options opened to us (particularly on mezzed mobs) that no one else has.  In some cases, the changes will allow us to do things unheard of before with some practice (for instance I can envision Fennin becoming able to be killed after the MT dies if that happens now) a 2nd tank on a raid will have a LOT to do now, which is cool.<br />
<br />
I'm sceptical. I raise questions not because I'm an idiot, but because the functionality doesn't look like it will put us in the same place to me.<br />
<br />
I think equivalency is an unrealistic standard, particuarly since I honestly believe that we will have somewhat superior sustained aggro to either knight class as a result of the changes and somewhat inferior snap aggro.  I find the impassable gulf of the last year and a half to have been far too much, but now it's not that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Val,<br />
<br />
I'm almost 100% convinced that the dot portion is designed around mezzed mobs and unmezzable adds, and thus is adds a crucial dimension that we didnt' have before.   I would be terribly disappointed if the dot portion were messed with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">You are correct, that's one place we differ. I don't want anyone in a group to think &quot;Oh, the MT is a Warrior. Darn it, I'll have to play accordingly.&quot; as far as aggro control is concerned.<br />
<br />
The game has gotten to the point where people look for a healer, CC, a slower, DPS, etc. and not classes. When they look for a tank, they are looking for survivability and aggro control.<br />
<br />
 Then the many min/maxers look for other assets - as you know this isn't our strong suit. Our survivability and agrro control have to be acceptable without reservation. Only then will people concider wether our disciplines and power-ups have sufficient value to say &quot;Grab the Warrior&quot;.<br />
<br />
If it is necessary to make adjustments because of a Wariror's aggro control, then it should be necessary to make adjustments because of a Knight's survivability. Neither are warranted.<br />
<br />
Just please keep in mind your total package concept might sound good to you, but if Warriors aren't rock solid in survivability and aggro control, it may take a very long time for the general player population to come to the same conclusion.<br />

Yeah this is real good stuff to be talking about, thanks. I'm survivable now pretty well. Aggro control is the main effort for me. Funny because I have a 40 paladin half elf girl. I started her in case they never did fix warriors. She has amazing aggro control. All it really takes at her level is to spam flash of light and maybe stun a little. <br />
<br />
I wish it could be so easy for us. I want to hold aggro. I want to be able to get it out of the gate. I hope this is the beginning of the warrior fix. <br />
