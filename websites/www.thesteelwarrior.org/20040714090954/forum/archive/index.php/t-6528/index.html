<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dinian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The &quot;over the top&quot; thread got me thinking a bit and I sat down with a spreadsheet to calculate proc based hate.<br />
<br />
Solid Assumptions with emperical evidence<br />
- Primary hand innate weapon procs always proc 2x per minute unadjusted (dual wield or no)<br />
- Secondary hand innate weapon procs always proc 1x per minute unadjusted<br />
- Weapon Affinity increases proc rate 10% on the innate and augmented weapon procs per AA level ending with a 50% bonus at WA5<br />
- Rarely, weapons have a proc modifier that increases proc rate on the innate weapon proc<br />
<br />
Assumptions without emperical evidence<br />
- A 0.0 second stun is 400 hate<br />
- Proc damage adds linearly to the hate with a 2/3 modifier (150 dd+0.0s stun = 500 hate)<br />
<br />
Then:<br />
<br />
DBoTW+Anger3 &amp; EoE+Anger3	8345<br />
DBoTW+Anger3 &amp; EoE+125Yak	8170<br />
BoW+Anger3			3900<br />
EoE+100Yak &amp; BoC		4820</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dinian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Looking at the above numbers, I think I need to adjust the hate attributed to a 0.0s stun down a bit... I mean, Ykesha just doesn't have the aggro AngerIII has in practice.<br />
<br />
Looking forward to feedback. Again, this is just a mental excercise... I'm not trying to reverse engineer the hate mechanics of the game... the best way to do that is get an enchanter to cast Anarchy on a mob and see how many ToT's it takes for an SK to pull agro back.<br />
<br />
Actually, that sounds like a great experiment!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Couple things:<br />
WA5 affects aug procs the same as it affects natural procs.<br />
I highly doubt that 1pt proc damage equals 1 point of hate, I believe it is significantly lower.  Otherwise ethereal destroyer would be a much higher quality weapon.  750dd would put it over enraging blow with that method.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Isnt 400 + 100 +  650 = 1150<br />
<br />
1:  Stun(0.00 sec/68) <br />
2:  Decrease Hitpoints by 100 <br />
3:  Increase Hate by 650<br />
<br />
I beleive weapon augs are affected by WA, just not &quot;spell/imbue&quot; procs.<br />
<br />
Finally I'm pretty sure that 1 dmg = 1 hate for Spell proc is too high</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">1 proc point of damage = two thirds of a point of hate, you can test it out using a SK or wizard.<br />
<br />
also Melee hate is based on damage potental (it is 2/3 a point of hate or 1/2 a point of hate, still trying to work this out using lucy and in game tests)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dinian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Again, just to see how the numbers work out.<br />
<br />
New Assumptions:<br />
- 0.0s stun is 300 hate (lowered it so that 100yak == angerII)<br />
- each point of damage is a point of hate<br />
<br />
<br />
DBoTW+Anger3 &amp; EoE+Anger3 	= 6930<br />
DBoTW+Anger3 &amp; EoE+125Yak	= 6755<br />
BoW+Anger3 			= 3300<br />
EoE+100Yak &amp; BoC 		= 3845<br />
<br />
That actually gels alot better with my &quot;gut feeling&quot; difference on the BoW+Anger3 vs. EoE+Yak &amp; BoC proc agro per time. The hate granted from the DMG+DB on the BoW probably would bring the BoW+Anger3 combo above the dualwield.</div></div><hr />

DBoTW+Anger3 &amp; EoE+125Yak	6508.333333<br />

<br />
Could you post a link to tests or the thread this was found in?  That'd still put ED proc at 500 points of hate, which is more than an EoE proc using the same method.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Dinian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If we &quot;reverse calculate&quot; the hate of 0.0s stun to set Timesnap hate to be equal to Time Lapse hate (500 assuming 1dd = 2/3 hate) then <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">huss it was a personal test, used a wizard standard fire based nuke<br />
<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=477&amp;source=Live<br />
<br />
i then used my mace of focused flame( http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=68 ), and i had a person PVP slow me so that my 2 ppm had a higher chance to go off on the first hit, took several trys on several mobs to get the spell to go off right away(proc i mean) but i got it to go off finally and 150(rounding down cause im lazy) at 2/3 is 100, i had the wiz nuke it twice, and then i had the proc go off, it turned on me.<br />
<br />
then i have him nuke it 3 times and we did it again, this time it didnt turn on me, for the sake of testing i did it again, this time it DID turn on me, but i got a critical hit along with my proc(since i was slow'd i could prevent a double round, it took alot of try's to do it)<br />
<br />
so im guessing that proc and potental melee damage(not counting crits or cripples) are about = to 2/3 or 1/2 its hard to base much off a short parse, but since the MoFF is pure damage it is a good way to test.(not to mention they are both fire based attacks)<br />
<br />
i also think there might be the question of &quot;first to attack&quot; or inital&lt;sp?&gt; aggro, this is by no means concreate and could prolly be better tested with an SK since they have finite hate number spells<br />
edit: testing mobs were rathe mountain giants, attacks done from front.(didnt parse it with a parser, used lucy to get my numbers to start with and worked with what i had)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">This is pure proc hate.<br />
Using Brodda Thep experiment we could factor in Melee Hate.<br />
 http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=3789<br />
Hate Value = (DB + 11 * MINIMUM)/delay<br />
<br />
We have DBoW+EoE &amp; DBoW+Coirnav both with Anger3.<br />
And i use a BoW+A3, and i often draw agro in PoTime.<br />
<br />
Based on pure Proc Hate, this should be almost impossible.<br />
Since its 2x the Hate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Lilwee Beasty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">While I have no doubt in my mind that a DBotW + EoE is better aggro than a BoW (all with anger 3) I'd be hard pressed to believe that it's less than half the aggro.<br />
<br />
My personal gut feeling would be normally, it's around 80-85% of the aggro of a DBotW + EoE...perhaps even more. Then again, my guild is *just* entering time now, so I haven't had much, if any real world experience with the two combo's and how they stack up against each other.</div></div><hr />

I believe the &quot;initial&quot; agro values can be significant.<br />
<br />
Also, with that mace, you are doing approx 30 points of hate per swing, did you factor this into (and remove it) when considering how much hate the proc is producing?<br />
<br />
I have used a lot of procing weapons, and I have always thought the hate was far lower than 2/3, more like 1/10th.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well pre time, Bloodfrenzy + Blasphemous Blade of the Exiled with two A3 will kill you fast to riposte, but should be a significant amount of hate.<br />
<br />
DBotW is slow 1H, with increased hate like BF and BBotE.<br />
<br />
My guess is DBotW/EoE should be approx double BoW when all 3 are A3'd.<br />
<br />
I can tell you this also:<br />
If you pull a sol ro mob with an arrow, then berate, then run around so that after 30 seconds you arrive in camp, then berate AGAIN, you will rarely lose agro to the enchanter tash/slow.  If I pull without waiting the 30 seconds, I WILL ALWAYS lose agro to the enchanter.  You can say he is a bad enchanter and you can say I suck, but I always lose agro to him.  He is very used to playing with a paladin, that will &quot;pull&quot; with a stun, run to camp, then stun again when the &quot;pulled&quot; mob is in range.  I never see the enchanter lose agro with that policy.<br />
<br />
This would indicate that:<br />
<br />
initial agro + 2 paladin stuns (5 to 10 seconds?  I am not a paladin)<br />
<br />
&gt;=<br />
<br />
initial agro+arrow+berate+30seconds of berate+berate again<br />
<br />
&gt;=<br />
<br />
tash + slow.</div></div><hr />

not at all sure lok, i didnt really figure in my swing damage, wouldnt mind somebody with a real parser trying to narrow down what numbers proc damage are in terms of hate</div></div><hr />

  Everthing everyone has checked says that it's the same aggro resisted as landed.</div></div><hr />
