<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">werdara</div><div class="date">11-19-2003, 12:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">With the &quot;new&quot; system of combat being implemented, perhaps this is too late, but I've been playing with this idea for 6 months and I'm NOT gonna quit now.<br />
<br />
I've posted earlier versions of this idea at various places and have been told this is the best spot for the most knowledgeable feedback, so here it is after much refinement, and thank you to those who helped get it to this point.<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------<br />
First, let me state my classes so you can see my perspective on this issue. I play, among other lowbies, a 65 Enc, 64 War, and 55 SK, and have spent time using wife's 52 Pal before she retired (mid-Velious age).<br />
<br />
My warrior was my first character on Tunare, first ever char beyond 20, and has been my main forever. Over 130 days played, none of it as a bazaar trader.<br />
<br />
I just hit 64 last night, and not for lack of trying.<br />
<br />
My Ench, started 2 years later, I played when I was LFG for more than an hour. She hit 65 with epic, before my warrior hit 58. I play her so much, that most of my guild calls me by my Ench, it has become listed (without my knowledge) as my primary char on the guild roster, and when I log my warrior, most people who joined our guild in the past 6 months don't know I'm the same person until I make it a point to remind them.<br />
<br />
I can tell you from the Enc point of view, that I will nearly always prefer a Knight for a tank in HoH, BoT, and any other zone where a mob can eat my Rune and AA Rune in 2 rounds of melee. And it makes me angry for thinking that. I know very few warriors who I can be fairly sure I will NOT get aggro tashing even at 90%, so much so that with warriors I normally skip Tash and just start slow at 95%. With knights, I know my Rune will be more likely to wear off than be removed by attacks.<br />
<br />
The reason for this is simple:<br />
1) Warriors aggro is dependant on gear and not everyone has EB.<br />
2) Knights can get aggro with or without good gear, because its all about spells<br />
3) In a pickup group, unless you KNOW the tank, and you often don't, you pick the person that is more likely to keep aggro, and as it stands, that is the Knights.<br />
<br />
I know several warriors on Tunare that have great aggro, and can keep mobs off me 98% of the time unless I personally do something stupid. But these are the cream of the crop, the Elemental capable warriors, with EB weapons, or Anger3 augs. JoeSchmoe the 65 Warrior who is LFG may or may not have EB and I will take a 62 Pal or SK over a 65 War that I don't personally know has EB weapons. Again, this makes me angry. EB is not so widely available as some people would like to think. Not every guild is in Emp room, or VT, or Elemental planes.<br />
<br />
Yes, warriors have 12% more HP with &quot;comparable gear&quot; but how often does that make a difference, honestly. Any cleric worth his wis starts CH at 40-50% (assuming slowed)depending on your tanks HP, and lands it at 20-30%, so that if its somehow interrupted, they have time for a fast heal. That means on your average (these days) pickup BoT tank of 5500 to 7k hp tanks, 2k is unused 95% of the time, so who cares if the warrior has 300 hp more?<br />
<br />
I don't believe warriors should be able to solo, that would be silly. After all, if the tank can solo Mob01, that means the cleric can CH once per fight, a slower is unnecessary, and if they DO slow, cleric can CH 2 times in 3 fights. That would suck beyond belief.<br />
<br />
All I, and most warriors I know, want is a way to get aggro thats reliable enough to make us as desirable as Knights. For this, we must see why Knights were suddenly better. And that answer we know is &quot;snap&quot; aggro, not overall good aggro, not insane damage, not the extra utility. On an inc, the Knight can grab aggro quickly enough that the group can be, as one person put it, lazy, and go all out / slow early. If you look carefully at the spells they use, you'll notice they produce high aggro but have longer recast times (Pally stuns) or high aggro but high mana cost (SK snares). Thus each can get aggro quickly, but can't be chained so fast that they have aggro 10x greater than Warrior. Neither does damage worth speaking of, at the level its used.<br />
<br />
What warriors need is a long reuse time ability (20 sec or so) that produces aggro (in the way EB does,though scaled down) without doing so much damage that would put our DPS far above Knights.<br />
<br />
As a side note, (which will be relevant shortly) someone at VI, yes pre-Sony, remarked in an interview about how they intended melees to sort of specialize in one weapon type, instead of each Ding being a race to cap all skill types.<br />
<br />
So here we go. Give warriors a new ability, and let us replace Disarm with it. Call it whatever, Cripple for all I care. I'll use that name from here on out, for lack of a better term.<br />
<br />
Here's the basis:<br />
&gt;Skill available at 30.<br />
&gt;Adds skills Specialize Blunt, Specialize Slash, Specialize Pierce.<br />
&gt;Whatever type of weapon you are using at the time you hit Cripple is the skill check used.<br />
&gt;First skill over 50 becomes the Specialty (Sound familiar?) and caps at 200.<br />
&gt;Other cap at 50<br />
&gt;Because people get different weapons they couldn't predict early in their careers, give us a PoP Ability AA that for 3 pts lets us raise one more spec. to 200, and 3 more AA lets us max the 3rd.  Also throw in a simple &quot;Spec reset quest&quot; like casters have in Temple of Sol Ro. as an alternative.<br />
<br />
&gt;Re-use time on Cripple is 20 seconds, not affected by Haste<br />
<br />
&gt;On successfully landing Cripple, it is automatically a Crit (or Crip) and also adds (Spec. Skill x 2.5) pure aggro.<br />
&gt;Give it a cool message for our egos, dependant again on the weapon type.<br />
Soandso disembowels Target (for slash) for xx damage.<br />
Soandso impales Target (pierce) for xx damage.<br />
Soandso smashes Target (blunt) for xx damage.<br />
<br />
As I see it, the longer re-use time means we can establish DECENT aggro MOST of the time on incoming, but not be able to get perma-aggro all the time via button mashing. Also not infallible like Knights, who get large aggro regardless of whether they get resisted. We can still miss and get almost no aggro. This should even the field by making us very good aggro getters / great tanks, vs. Knights great aggro / very good tanks.<br />
<br />
This would help even mid-level characters, and we all know that 90% of &quot;balancing&quot; refers only to the 50+ people and always has.<br />
<br />
The long re-use time also means it won't substantially raise our DPS. We all know how often crits love to hit for less than normal full damage anyway. 2 more crits per minute (assuming 1 misses) isn't that much more dmg.<br />
<br />
This would also give warriors the ability to specialize in one weapon type, and even though MOST will choose slash, there are enough upper end blunts and a few piercers that might make some think twice.<br />
------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Please place any feedback you have, good or bad. I'd like to refine this more and hopefully get some attention from SOE to at least have it reviewed by the Dev team.<br />
<br />
Also, please limit the feedback to the idea itself, I don't really want to wade through tons of flames about my grouping choices, etc that have little relevance to the point of this post.<br />
<br />
Thirdly, sorry it was so long, I kinda ramble in my posts  <br />
<br />
I'll also welcome any email feedback at eqaddicts@bellsouth.net<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Viladdar</div><div class="date">11-19-2003, 04:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Great idea, IMO. At least it would give something more to do than just mash taunt and pray. But I'd prefer this as a new additional skill, in addition to disarm rather than a replacement of disarm :) Anyway, weapon specialisation looks nothing but just logical. Hope someone will support it in the chat. At least, this would make us less dependant on the RNG... the Sony version of it, with their &quot;openings&quot; sounds cool but if those &quot;openings&quot; are totally impredictable that makes it just worth crap for aggro, which is our main concern.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tanaruk</div><div class="date">11-21-2003, 01:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like the idea for the simple reason that it puts the warrior-player at least partially in control of agro, rather than totally relying on groupmates and procs.  Some martial artists, like boxers and karate afficionadoes, have a repetoire of moves which -how can I put it?- do little other than piss off your opponent.  I could see something like this not even being connected to a crit, but just being part of a normal attack sequence too.  The key being that it generates agro for us, and we control when it's used.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anker steadfast</div><div class="date">11-22-2003, 12:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Your &quot;cripple&quot; idea is much aking to the one I have that I call &quot;anger&quot; (wrote about my ideas in this thread (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=4375) ) and it's an idea I've rooted for since pre-velius and have /feedback'ed it many times over the years.<br />
<br />
Alas, it seems noone found it even the least interesting.<br />
<br />
Your Cripple idea differs on one point though - You want it to do damage as well. I'd rather prefer it not to, so I could use it on a mezzed MOB without breaking Mez.<br />
<br />
As for Weapon specialization - I'm still amazed that this isn't in the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lidan</div><div class="date">11-22-2003, 01:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Casters can specialize in their casting but melees can't specialize in their weapons.  Another thing, the reason warriors keep losing their agro abilities is all the expansions.  The casters and hybrids have gotten new spells and better gear, while warriors have been stuck without many of the new items.  This is truely an unfair advantage to warriors and many of the ideas listed in Brainstorm and this one should be implemented to give warriors more of an advantage.  Warriors have been ignored long enough its time that we finally are heard by SOE.</div></div><hr />
