<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Contention</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello, I'm pretty new to the board just been looking around on it. Im not really sure about alot of things in game but I just hit 51 last night and was wondering what I should be looking forward too and what kind of gear I will need, because I plan to get really involved in raiding and what not. Take a look at my Magelo account and thats what Im working with at the moment, any suggestions whould be great as what I should do for weap/armor wise. Thank you for the help. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>naerron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">hey bro, u have tons of items with no sort of HP on them or sta on them at all, work on that and you can greatly up your HP.  i think the best way for low lvl people to upgrade is to do LDONs, A) is decent exp for those who have never been to KT, B) you work on decent gear upgrades as well.  The LDON gear is very nice if you can not get ele gear or better.</div></div><hr />

Enter in the accurate numbers under skills to get your attack and other stats correct.<br />

cheap upgrades ( a cheap one and a &quot;better&quot; one ;) )<br />
<br />
<br />
Skull shaped Barbut<br />
Dented Kunzar Warhelm<br />
--<br />
Mantle of Distraction<br />
Tattered Mantel<br />
--<br />
<br />
Mask are not many usefull out ther maybe <br />
tribal war mask  or Veil of the executioner</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mukaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I don't know what your budget is like but Mask of Flourishing Fungus or Face Mask of Frozen Mana are great. The fungus mask is likely to be the cheaper of the two.<br />
<br />
It also looks like you forgot to put your arms slot in. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Raunstonecutter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">What kind of raiding does your guild do?    If you guys can kill in Plane of Growth (old school!) some of the berzerker's (warrior armor, not the stupid class) armor there is half way decent.  Its pretty much the same as Thurg quest gear, just its dropped as it, no need to turn in.<br />
<br />
Or, if you're going to grind out the LDoN rout, the MM warrior gear, the 750ish stuff, is very solid.  And would server you well as you could aquire pieces.  As far as your weaker slots, check out the bazaar, or a LDoN sorting script to see whats going to put AC, raw HP and Stamina in those slots.<br />
<br />
Good luck =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">1ac = 6hp = 1sta until sta is capped. Live by that formula and your gear choices should be very clear. Str doesn't matter. Dex doesn't matter. Agi doesn't matter. Wis and int don't matter either... see the trend? Resists don't matter either! Attack matters a little bit, but not more than a little bit of hp/ac. Same with regen. Better haste would be cool, but not immediately vital. <br />
<br />
  Your weapons are solid. Stay with them.<br />
<br />
  Oh, and were the arms Ry'gorr?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Contention</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thank you all for the help, Im looking for more hp and ac items.  Also my guild doesnt raid for some reason Im looking for one that will or try to get my guild into it. So I will prob have to go the ldon way, but thats ok cause I dont mind them. Well thanks again for all the help.</div></div><hr />
