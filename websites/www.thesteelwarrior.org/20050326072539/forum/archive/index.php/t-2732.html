<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">08-26-2003, 05:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, the patch message &quot;Claims&quot; to have revamped several zones partially.  What exactly did they do?  I'll start.<br />
<br />
Took a trip to HS..didn't see any new stuff on track, and the south wing door was still locked, so they didn't get rid of that key at least.  I didn't think about checking north or west wings because there was people there.<br />
<br />
Then I scooted over to CT, no new mobs on track, zone layout was the same from what I could see, so I figured that the most likely thing they removed would be the summoning, and nope, the level 51 trash at the zone in still summoned.  The next most annoying thing in CT is Bane of Thule...but I didn't wanna try that with my lone scouting dr00d.<br />
<br />
Then I took a trip to DN.  On the way, I passed thru SG and noticed several new mobs on track, including &quot;The Mistriss of Darkwater&quot; and Siren Myrmidons.  From the density of the Siren Myrmidons on track, I would guess that the SG revamp was intent on lowering the population of goddamned enchanter mobs.<br />
<br />
In DN there was a new named Rat i'd guess...I didn't venture into the paebala area to find him, and in the 2nd half of the upper area I saw &quot;An odd looking spider&quot; on track.  As I was about to find him, a dragon construct spawned and not wanting to deal with that mess, I exodus'd.   So it looks like the most annoying part of DN (namely the traps) are still there, or at least some of them.  If they just get rid of the fuckin dispell traps in the rat caves, i'll call it good.<br />
<br />
A guildy said he didn't notice anything new about Velks, but I'd assume he was just soloing at the entrance, so I wouldn't expect him to see much.<br />
<br />
So what else changed, and what only &quot;supposedly&quot; changed, and what did they think they were getting so much &quot;Player feedback&quot; on as opposed to the real annoyances in these zones?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mekil Jueaze</div><div class="date">08-27-2003, 12:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Hole has been pretty much revamped mob wise....other then the elementals at the zone in all the mobs are different.  <br />
<br />
Couple of them are in different places.  <br />
<br />
Huge golems wander the drop down area in the first section of the zones while Gargoyles (they used the storm watcher models) perch on top of the city walls all over the place.  <br />
<br />
The elementals that roam the place are now about 50% bigger...they added another name too an Elemental Monstrosity...didn't look any different.<br />
<br />
They changed the old mud golem skin to the steel golem skin.  <br />
<br />
Ghosts now have different names.  I wasn't able to get down too far in the hole as the tunnel down to the graveyard/yael area has see invis gargoyles (kills my brell rogue gimp everytime), so I don't know what they've done down there.  <br />
<br />
Nortlav the Scalekeeper has had a name change...think it was Echo of Nortlav...the bottom area where Yael is also has had a change done to the tunnel leading into it...there is now a rock door there with two guardian gargs.<br />
<br />
Noticed about 8 or more locked doors running around in the city with a small change or two to some of the rooms...though honestly I'm not sure if those doors were there before or not....<br />
<br />
Don't know if they've moved Yael or not, wasn't up when I got to roam around.  <br />
<br />
I have a hunch though that they have made some changes to the graveyard area....they moved Keeper of the Tombs to the level that the ench epic mob is on.  Would like to know if any one has been able to see any other mobs moved :).<br />
<br />
<br />
Working on some screenies...might be able to get them up here.<br />

Hell, I was saying just this week that I'd go to the Hole, but there's just not enough locked doors there.<br />
<br />
Fuckin idiots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khumak</div><div class="date">08-27-2003, 04:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah they need to add more zones without zoneouts too.  I love having to spend 300pp to gate out of a zone I wasn't able to find a group in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">08-27-2003, 10:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, this is retarded.  When I hear &quot;Partial zone revamp,&quot; I know what I'd fix if I was in charge.  Lets take the Hole as an example.<br />
<br />
One, that goddamned locked door at the front, no need for it.  Either put the key merchant in a reasonable location, or have the erudites work some frigging magic on those rocks.  No one buys keys, no one brings a rogue, and yet everyone manages to get into the Hole after a lot of fuckin around.  HELLO MCFLY.  Your goofy ass door with a hole in it isn't stopping anyone.  Just take the goddamned thing out.<br />
<br />
Two, unless you're like level 50 and killing the 5 mobs at the front of the zone, you need a porter to get back out after you drop off the ledge.  Smooth out the drop off so it's a ramp, patch the zone and redownload it for crying out loud.<br />
<br />
Three, Yael's death touch is retarded.  It makes a 1 group mob impossible to one group.  People dont like being able to kick ass all the way to the bottom of a dungeon and then get their ass summarily whomped by a pussy elemental with an attitude problem.  Basically he just makes me get 2 other guildies to fight down to him so we can kill him.<br />
<br />
There ya go, a partial revamp of the Hole, took me 5 seconds to write up, would take a coder/designer about 20 minutes of work, and that's if he took his break during that time.  People don't go to the Hole because it's kinda out of the way, the door is a pain in the ass, and they don't wanna have to gate out of there if they can't find a druid or a wizard.  It's definitely not because of the elemental models or the names of mobs you idiots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tugurok</div><div class="date">08-27-2003, 11:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yael is gone. There's a new mob in his spot called &quot;Gaurdian of the Seal&quot;, with two animated constructs at his side. He has a steel golem/black reaver type model. Looks cool. Conned indifferent to my brell rogue (while not sneaking/hiding). The only way I was able to get down into the lair was jumping over the waterfall -- it's no longer possible for Brell rogues to CR from Yael's lair, which is stupid and annoying. It was nice when I could promise my gunshy guildies a gauranteed CR, since we never have a necro around. Now I can't. Woot.<br />
<br />
I can't understand zones that are harder, more dangerous, and less rewarding than PoP zones, which have graveyards. I love graveyards; CR is just annoying, not fun. <br />
<br />
The Hole has always been one of my very favorite zones, and the new changes are probably fine, but not being able to walk in without a hassle, walk out at all, or CR readily, is stupid.</div></div><hr />

I wonder how this effects the strength of the elements quest...I never did mine for the very reasons stated above, well...that and pure laziness.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Futumsh</div><div class="date">08-27-2003, 01:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been to Grieg's End and Charasis since the revamps.<br />
<br />
Charasis:<br />
<br />
There seem to be many more spawn spots for the normal nameds.  We got 2 SoDB's just walking to Drusella, and many more of the other previously rare-ish loots.  A master key can now be gotten (ground spawns combined in a ground spawn container).  Drusella had a new belt drop, but still no urn *grumble*.<br />
<br />
Grieg's End:<br />
<br />
Level increased on trash - blue to 65.  There are random spawn nameds which drop ok but not great items, and the random spawn nameds can also drop Grieg's key.  There are 10 shadow masters in Grieg's room, and they invis themselves.  There is a trap inside Grieg's door that teleports you to Grieg, and a trap at Grieg's spot that mezzes and invisses you for 24 seconds.  Grieg cannot be hurt until all the shadow masters are dead.  He drops the same loot table he used to, or at least, the 2 items we got were from the old loot table.  He turns human at around 5% rather than respawning as human after being killed now.</div></div><hr />

The mutants didnt see invis, and while looking for a named (somthing Warlord, blue to 52) I agro'd a ghost. Too damn lazy to kill it I gated and then I had to raid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Walked right out of The Hole last night. I think some previously locked doors are now unlocked, and you end up coming out of that building right before the halfpipe.<br />
<br />
Varaho hit the nail right on the head....PoSky sucks so hard. I would rank it #1 on the &quot;needs a massive revamp&quot; list. Let's take a neat zone, with a cute way of progressing through it, then ruin it by making it so bug-ridden and agonizingly slow that no one will ever go there unless they really need to. I could finish up my epic very quickly by doing PoSky, and I could probably get an adequate force to go kill on 5 for a while...but man...it is TOO MUCH of a pain.<br />
<br />
Anyway, going back to The Hole tonight. Going to crawl and kill our way through as much of the zone as time permits. Lots of the old mobs are still there too, only they are untargettable corpses that are strewn about like something &quot;took over.&quot; I'll spend a solid day or two there just enjoying something new, then will probably forget about it again until someone needs an epic piece from the place...unless they did something REALLY cool...which I kind of doubt.<br />

That is gonna hella suck for me...Yael was the last mob I needed for my Strength of the Elements *unless* Guardian of the Seal drops the Ore, which I doubt....</div></div><hr />

The spiders don't seem to port people anymore.  Still have traps in the caves, maybe a little more rats and might respawn quicker but the rats didn't seem harder.<br />

Ran into one new named.  Some lore keeper.  Not any harder than a dominator.  Dropped:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rexiant</div><div class="date">08-28-2003, 12:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Went back to The Hole tonight. Nortlav and Yael are gone it seems (unconfirmed - maybe moved). But in the Yael area are 4 mobs:<br />
<br />
Echo of Nortlav<br />
Guardian of the Seal + 2 guards (an ancient construct? i forget)<br />
<br />
&gt;<br />
<br />
Echo of Nortlav cons DB and indifferent to a lvl 55. At 65 I tanked him dual weilding (non-defensive) and didn't get beat up very badly. At 4994hp and 1166ac unbuffed I'm not the beefiest tank either. Someone told me he was lifetapping me like Nortlav did but I really didn't see it in hp loss or in his regen.<br />
<br />
We had 12 people: 65war, 65pally, 65chanter, 65druid, 64shaman, 65ranger (AM3 EQ ~ did NOT /disc trueshot), 63mage, 55ranger, 50ranger, 55bard, 58shaman, 60cleric. This was overkill for him.<br />
<br />
He dropped 2 things:<br />
<br />
Jagged Sword of the Dragon Slayer   <br />
LORE ITEM MAGIC ITEM NO DROP  <br />
Slot: PRIMARY  <br />
Damage: 20 Delay: 25 <br />
AC: +10 Str: +10 Int: +10 Disease Resist: +20 Poison Resist: +20 HP: +50 Mana: +50  <br />
Weight: 0.5 <br />
Weapon Skill: One Hand Slash <br />
Classes: Shadowknight  <br />
Races: None  (that's right...NONE...quest-related most likely) EDIT: or broken!<br />
Effect: Nortlav's Vengeance<br />
<br />
<br />
AND<br />
<br />
<br />
Red Dragon Scale<br />
<br />
Nice that getting the red dragon scale is MUCH easier than it used to be. Went to the bard, I had mine =)<br />
<br />
&gt;<br />
<br />
Guardian of the Seal conned red and indifferent to a lvl 65. Not wanting to wipe the raid with no easy CR at 11pm EST we set everyone on the other side of the room and I went defensive and arrowed him once.<br />
<br />
Max hit defensive was 678 and minimum was 391. His guards (DB @ 65) were meleeing (279max 94min) and nuking for 825 (You succumb to the lure of ice.  You have taken 825 points of damage.), and they &quot;are unaffected&quot; by lvl65 enchanter pacify, mez was not attempted. Took the three of them 18 seconds to kill me with a rune up and lvl 60 cleric celestial running on pull.<br />
<br />
His guards returned to their spots but he stayed in the middle of the room, so we had someone try to single him from there just to see if it could be done, however the guards came as well. Their agro triggers may be linked so they all come regardless.<br />
<br />
After that we left. We didn't have the forces to kill him, but it looks like a lot of fun to try if you're bored. Alla's has an earring up that he drops, and not much else yet. Now I really want to know what is behind that damn door.<br />
<br />
So anyway, big thumbs up to the new hole so far. Everything in deep has very high MR and they will partially mitigate slow when you land it. Have fun, and if you're not in a very big or powerful guild, you can still pop in to get a red scale, and pick up some of the new masks that are dropping from random mobs for your int casters.<br />

Imagine the horror of doing CR when your necro has to FD his way through the hole just to summon corpses.</div></div><hr />

I miss that.  PoP has made a lot of people pussies and whiny bitches.  Where it used to be if a cr was 30 minutes that was considered a fast cr.  Now you only have to wait about 10-15 minutes and your corpse is summoned for you....bleh.  Had a near wipe out in NToV the other night and by the time we got back up on our feet we had people gating out and loggin 'cause it took to long'.<br />

Hope all the zones aren't easy to get to :P</div></div><hr />

If you camped the pit. the contructs and most of the new mobs are unmezzable and partial slow. Also have high resists. Not many hp thou and dont hit real hard. P.S if you thing psky is bad try vt.

I did just warn you against the bad zone design that was made previously with zones such as Hate and Fear, where you should be god damn sure that you could break the zone in, because if you failed, then you needed another guild to clear the zone in for you.<br />
The same problem was somewhat present with PoM, where only a few ubah guilds could get to it, and that zone is mainly a group encounter zone. Think about it if PoM was guild raid encounters and you wiped with the nearest bindpoint being WW.</div></div><hr />

It's now seems a lot harder to just run through.  More mobs, see invis, I made it up to the ice on the WW side then I got nuked to death by some manatees (some 800 damage retribution type spell).<br />
<br />
Later we hung around the siren castle killing stuff for shawl pieces.  The exp there seemed pretty good (maybe half the rate of grouping in PoV), and they were pretty wimpy.<br />
<br />
Got a 2H piercing weapon 28/39 with the wavecrasher proc.  War/Pal/Shd  Can't think of when I'd use it instead of a Truncheon of Doom for slow, but it was nodrop.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gruda</div><div class="date">09-07-2003, 03:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A couple nights ago, I went down The Hole with a bunch of friends to do the Jaiel the Wretched/Jaiel the Insane turn-in and kill for one friend's ranger alt's epic quest.  Our group consisted of me (61 warrior), a 58 chanter (my husband), a 57 shaman, a 51 warrior, a 52 cleric, and a 53 ranger.<br />
<br />
I was able to single pull the entire night, although we had some wanderer adds.  Some of the pathing in the city seems to have been improved, especially in the &quot;Candy Shop&quot; area.  I really like all the gargoyles perching on the walls.  Their aggro radius seems to be very level-limited.  I would walk past a bunch, call an all-clear to advance to the rest of the party, and the lower-levels would aggro a garg or two.  In the city, all the ghosts, constructs, and golems were dark blue to me (61).  The constructs are unmezzable, and extremely resistant to root and slow.  With the 57 shaman maloing and both the shaman and the 58 chanter trying to slow, I tanked most constructs unslowed.  Their highest hits seemed to be about 360's, but they hit fairly fast for golems.<br />
<br />
The best thing about the revamp, is the unlocking of a door that allows non-gaters with no druid/wizard in their group a way to get out, without buying gate potions.</div></div><hr />

Jael the Wretched cannot be spawned immediately after killing Jael the Insane. As many of you will remember you used to be able to chain spawn him like the General in Kith for the rogue epic.<br />
<br />
I do not know what the respawn time on Jael the Wretched is, it is at least an hour.</div></div><hr />
