<br />
  Iam coming back from about a year break from EQ and I need some advice.<br />
<br />
  I currently dont have the time for a raiding guild so I was wondering what items Iam able to upgrade with the help of some friends of mine.  <br />
<br />
  The &quot;crew&quot; would consist of two 65 Cleric's, 65 Chanter &quot;bot&quot;, 65 Shammy, 65 Beastlord, 65 SK, maybe a 65 monk and myself.  All the above are EP geared but the SK and myself.<br />
<br />
  We are looking for something that would be somewhat of a challenge and considering my lack of hp that would be quiet a few things  :p <br />
<br />
EDIT:  I also have a few points from LDoN at the BB camp but those camps can be very boring.<br />
  <br />
Thank you for your replies in advance.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Friedrick</div><div class="date">09-02-2004, 02:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would suggest starting in Plane of Tactics and farming the armorer/supplier for ornate.  Once you get a couple of pieces (sell the stuff you can't use to buy what you can) head to BOT and whack Einride the tower boss.  GBoS and Plate BP come from him, both very good upgrades for you.  After that, kill Vahkiz the Shade in PON for shoulders.  Getting others to help is easy since he drops a sought after quest piece.<br />
<br />
After that I would try the named that drops legs in Tactics.  When you have Ornate BP, legs, helm, gloves and  boots I would head out to GoD and have a go at the trials.  There are a couple of nice upgrades there that aren't too bad to get now.  I wear a ring and arms from one and there is a great haste belt and face piece from there as well.<br />
<br />
Just my suggestions.<br />

The sewer expaditions in barindu , and Vxed's (expadition from npc in barindu) named mobs have nice loot also.<br />
<br />
PoP wise, thats a good crew to own some Solro mini's with Xuzl is easy one group, and most likely if you spend up to 5 hours there you will see some ornate droppage. Daiku Overseer is usually always up in Tactics, and you could possibly 1 group Auliffe in bot (might have to get a warrior to tank :P )also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wagdork</div><div class="date">09-02-2004, 04:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Been awhile since I have been to a PoP zone but I thought you needed flags to get into Tactics and Solro.  If not I am game.  Also does ornate in Solro drop off trash or just mini's?<br />
<br />
  Was also wondering if there was anything old world that was doable with this group like maybe the Guardian of the Seal or something similar.  I find older content much more appealing then PoP.<br />
<br />
  I dont have GoD yet but was planning on getting it soon.  I've had mixed feelings about buying it considering I probably wont be doing much of it with until I gear myself up.<br />

Ornate drops off, I believe, almost any mob in Solro.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
ornate drops off all the mobs before the towers for sure.... dunno bout some of the guys in the towers (the big devilish looking red guys im not sure about)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And Wagdork, if you lack flags, maybe try to tag along with a friendly guild to kill behemoth in PoI or do the alternative PoStorms quest for tactics... Ornate can drop off certain mobs and its alot less crowded than BoT (which only requires 62+)<br />
<br />
Worst case scenario, grind a BoT camp for some nameds to upgrade gear to ornate, then once you have more HP... on to GoD! :)<br />
<br />
just my 2 copper</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bonequest</div><div class="date">09-03-2004, 12:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with Vermen. Tactics will be a very nice exp zone after OoW comes out because there are lots of red and yellow con Daiku in there in the tallon and vallon areas which will be good experience for level 70 people to kill.  Ornate boot molds also drop there from the piglet and perhaps other parts but I am not sure.  If you do the PoStorms Tactics quest all you have to do is kill a few dozen Daiku warriors (1 at a time) and loot 4 peices of a medalion.  The turn in will flag a whole group for the zone and can be multiquested as well.  The group whose member turns in the last piece gets the flag if you MQ it.</div></div><hr />
