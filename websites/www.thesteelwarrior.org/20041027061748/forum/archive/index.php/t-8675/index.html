<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gordic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been away for a while and i am back and reading thru the threads. I have seen alot of new terms that i am not familiar with.  What is cultural and tributes and anything else i might need to know about.  <br />
<br />
Also, i am starting a new barb warrior and have about 20k to spend.  any suggestions on what armor and weapons and equip i should get to make the best use of my money?  <br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gaspie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Culture = player made armor diety armor. Example - Helanic Tundra, Fierce Heraldic, Dark Prince etc. There are also forms of these but with weaker stats available for people who chose to be agnostic or any other.<br />
<br />
Tribute is a new thing that I have not taken the time to learn about. All I know is there is a certain npc in your hometown, race specific, that you can give droppable items to for points and those points can be used for effects such as enduring breath or haste.<br />
<br />
If you are going to start a barbian warrior I'd suggest buying Helanic Tundra, it is The Tribunal class specific and has great stats. Find someone who crafts it and try to make a deal with them. I bought most pieces very cheap and probably spent a total of 20kish on the whole set.</div></div><hr />
