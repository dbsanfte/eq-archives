Anyone have any clue? Anyone test?<br />
<br />
Weapon enchants are +damage per swing.  You can tell this by comparing your base dps, to the applied dps from your attack.<br />
<br />
....<br />
<br />
As a test today, I was messing around with an iron counterweight.  The test weapon as Princess Theradras Scepter.<br />
<br />
3.40 delay, 126-190 per swing.  (Other effects, but thats irrelivant to this.)<br />
<br />
I have 656 attack which adds, 46.9 dps.<br />
<br />
This comes out to..<br />
<br />
288-353 per swing,  for 94.3 dps<br />
<br />
Ok, applied counterweight.<br />
<br />
288-353 per swing, for 97.1 dps<br />
<br />
Now.. what I was expecting, was for the counterweight to just haste the weapon, and having your applied strength dps come out the same.<br />
IE, the 3% haste to the weapon is only improves the base weapon dps.<br />
<br />
However.. it's not.  It improves your total dps (from applied strength) by 3% as well.  This makes it suck a lot less than I initally expected.</div></div><hr />

so is that adding to the weapons base damage or to the damage dealt after mob mitigation is factord n stuff?</div></div><hr />

Couldn't tell ya without a parser :D  But I do know it's not dps.</div></div><hr />

right on ;)<br />
<br />
I got a new staff in Tanaris that does higher DPS than the whirly axe :D I'll test it out without and then with the enchantment to see what the diff is.</div></div><hr />

Hmm, that's odd - if anything adding a counterweight should *decrease* your damage per swing. I wonder if that is a bug ala seal of the crusader.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was expecting it to decrease just the applied strength bonus per swing.. Keeping the the dps from it the same. Thats not the case though..<br />
<br />
I don't think it's a bug, otherwise it would make the 1% haste enchants for gloves etc trash.   What it does do, is makes counterweights a respectably viable option for weapon damage at least.  In anycase... we'll see what happens after SoTC is patched, I've got another 2h I can throw a weight on and check.<br />
<br />
Edit: <br />
<br />
Just talked to a pally friend of mine, SotC says it lowers damage, where as the counterweight mentions nothing about it.  Can only assume it's working properly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">02-07-2005, 10:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If the counterweight lowered the damage on the weapon, it would be completely fucking useless.  Making your weapon hit faster but do the same damage over time is kinda lame given the fact that it's only 3% haste.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, can someone PLEASE fucking explain the purpose behind paying money for a +damage weapon enchantment?  This seems pointless beyond all compare, especially since the majority of warriors end up being smiths.<br />
<br />
I have so many solid stones right now that I don't know what to do with them.  They sell to the vendor for 20s a stack, or I can turn them into +6 sharpening stones for no cost.  20s for 10 hours of combat time with a +6 enchant, or paying MULTIPLE GOLD (!) for an enchant that's gonna be useless when you upgrade your weapon?  Am I fucking missing something here or is everyone retarded?<br />
<br />
Yes, I know that sharpening stones don't stack with Windfury and the like (but it shouldn't matter anyway given that all you candyasses seem to be Alliance), but enchantments don't stack with Counterweights and Weapon Chains.  There's gotta be something that I'm missing here because I can't believe that EVERYONE wants to be a retarded jedi.  Didn't get your lightsaber in EQ, so gotta have it in WoW?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Stones and the enchants stack, so not too relevant.<br />
<br />
For 2handers, I never enchant because Counterweights almost always provide a better return (and I can make them myself for very little cost).  For 1handers, the only other option besides an enchant is a Weapon Chain, which I don't have the recipe for.  I get an enchant on those usually, just because it's the only thing I CAN do.  If I had the Weapon Chain recipe, I would use that though.<br />
<br />
One of my static group is an enchanter though, so I never pay for them.  He gets all the crap drops in instances, and gives out the enchants from the disenchanted bits.<br />
<br />
No way I'd pay 10g for a +4 on a 1hander though.  The DPS it adds is pretty minor, and that 10g can do a lot more for me somewhere else.<br />
<br />
In short, I think you may have hit the nail on the head with the lightsaber comment.<br />

No, they don't.  At least not damage enchants.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">02-07-2005, 11:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not a smith, I'm an enchanter so I put +dmg weapon enchantments on my weaps.  I havent had time to test the differences yet, but I know when I put the 3% counter weight on my Whrilwind Axe, I used it for a day like that and went back to the +dmg enchant cause i didnt notice much difference between the two.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">02-07-2005, 11:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Let me ask you this, Bongman.<br />
<br />
If you were not a smith, and not an enchanter, and you had 2 options, which would you choose?<br />
<br />
1 -- +damage permanent enchant, for a few gold pieces.<br />
<br />
2 -- +damage sharpening stones, that you can apply to any weapon, for 1/10 of the cost, in 10 combat hour stacks. <br />
<br />
Seriously, how much does a specific damage enchant run?  I don't know any numbers for economy, mostly because I don't care, but I'd dump a stack of Solid Sharpening stones (+6 damage, 30 min) for 30s because it's 10 more than I can get from the vendor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
btw since when doesn't sharpening stones and + dmg enchants stack??? Quote a source haass because I used both for many lvls... until I go two very useless demonslaying enchants for the fun pryomaniac glow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">02-07-2005, 12:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">With out knowing all the what stacks with what details, I'd go with number 2 until I felt it was costing more to keep buying the sharpening stones than the cost of enchanting for the same dmg.  Then I'd probably get it enchanted out of pure laziness (so I dont have to keep recasting every 30min).  But by the prices you lay out, I highly doubt that would happen.<br />
<br />
Too many unknowns for me to go either way, I'm still looking for whats &quot;best&quot; myself.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's what I get for not paying attention, if true.  Will check it out tonight...  Does it just take the higher of the two damage enchants, and apply that?  Or does the static enchant always override the non-static?<br />
<br />
If that is the case, getting a damage enchant on a 2hander would be even less useful than I thought, if you're a smith.<br />

<br />
On my server (Silver Hand), +4 1hander enchants tend to run in the 8-10g range.  Not sure on the +7 2hander ones, but I'd assume around the same.  I think 30s is about right for 20 x Solid Sharpening Stones as well, so you're probably looking at something like 300 combat hours of Stones for that price.<br />
<br />
From an economy standpoint, damage enchants just don't seem worth it.<br />

<br />
I got a +damage enchant when I was younger with one of the guys in my group earlier, and a sharpening stone overwrote the enchant.  I just wanna get a screenshot, for posterity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">02-07-2005, 12:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Er... TS Champ is enchanted with the +7 damage aug. When I applied a dense sharpening stone I did see an 8 point rise in my damage per the UI. (Range went from 206-261 to 214-269).</div></div><hr />

When we tried back then, we got the &quot;Are you sure you want to replace Blah Blah Crappy Enchant with Sharpened +5?&quot;<br />
<br />
So that makes the case for weapon enchants a little stronger, but not by much.</div></div><hr />

When a player or NPC can take away my only way of dealing damage or using abilities for 6+ seconds, I'd rather not risk a small enchantment bonus.  However, if I had a Destiny and only did PvE, that might be a different story.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Felwin</div><div class="date">02-07-2005, 01:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">To me, the only damage enchantment that is really useful is on a very fast 1hander.  Adding +4 or +5 per swing would be a fairly signifigant DPS increase on a 1.5 speed dagger.  Since I believe the enchantment ignores weapon speed completely and just adds on its base damage per swing.<br />
<br />
For tanking, I can't see a better enchantment other than Icy Chill, I'm a 300 enchanter, and I have been waiting patiently for me and my wife to finish Scholomance so she can get the formula for transmuting essences so I can start applying this enchantment.  Its a snare + a slow, to me, that just screams tank enchantment.</div></div><hr />

Good to know that I'm not completely crazy.<br />
<br />
When you're dual wielding fast weapons, +4 can add up pretty fast.  It's better than nothing, but I still wouldn't pay 20g for it.<br />
<br />
If I could ever get a Weapon Chain plan or find someone that could make them, that would be novel.  Nothing makes me want to throw the cat more than being chain disarmed.<br />

Since thats the case, I may try and go get some haste applied if I ever get a set of worthy gloves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telen</div><div class="date">02-18-2005, 07:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My girlfriend is an enchanter.  She gets components for her enchants from guild raids where no one wants/needs the drop, so we let her have it and she disenchants it.  So enchantments cost me zero, and since they stack with the stones I make that's some nice damage for no cost.  Weapon chains are nice, I have one on the 2H I use for PvP, but in most cases NPC's don't disarm, and in the cases they do I can either swap in a weapon with chain or just deal with it.  I just went for the fiery enchant on my main 1H, which from what I hear is better dps than +dmg, anyone know for sure?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Binabink</div><div class="date">02-19-2005, 02:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another thing to note is that with the + damage from beastslaying enchant, so I'm assuming all the +dmg affects but I haven't tested them all yet, will also add to the damage done by your shield spike if you have one.  I recently upgraded shields so haven't had a chance to get a new spike on this one, but I'll have to check if the sharpening stone adds to the shield spike also.<br />
<br />
With a mithril shield spike (16 - 20 dmg per block, not affected by mitigation), and mostly protection spec'd, it accounted for 1.5% of my damage dealt over an evening.  That's not too bad for free.   The overall total I'd dealt according to cosmos dps+ was around 300k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dracillion</div><div class="date">02-21-2005, 06:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For DPS I see most of our rogues dueling two crusader enchants.  Two fast weapons with the chance (and crusader procs a ton) of healing you for 100+ and buffing your stength for 100 is apparently more dps than the +dmg enchants.  I just got one on my Iceblade Hacker and I like it a lot.  (tht Axe is incredible dps)  <br />
<br />
For tanking I see lots of folks with the Unholy enchant.  I think this lowers your opponent's dmg by 15 or something.  Dunno, I can't see any enchant being overpowering, but I'm definately going to try two crusaders in the near future.</div></div><hr />

Unless you have a fetish for blue glowing.<br />

PS: Crusader isn't ALL magnificent. The lifetap aug has a 30% proc rate, so that's something you might want to consider before you enchant your weapon =p</div></div><hr />

There's only 2 people on Illidan Alliance that can do lifetap, and 5-6 that can do Crusader =/</div></div><hr />

If you have a skilled que'ed up like Concussion blow or Cleave, or any of the &quot;Do on next attack&quot; skills, if fiery goes off it cancels your ability and you just atttack normally.  Now, you don't lose the rage, but if you are counting on getting a concussion blow off, and you have to make another swing with a 2hander, its pretty annoying, I actually wiped out a fiery enchantment I had on my dreadforge and went with a +7 since thats all the components I had on me at the time.</div></div><hr />
