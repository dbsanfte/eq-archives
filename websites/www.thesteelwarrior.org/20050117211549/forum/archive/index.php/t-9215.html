<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Timothian</div><div class="date">10-01-2004, 06:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello all, lots and  lots of good information on agro weapons, and agro setup.  I am wondering what weapon I should be aiming for when I am in DPS mode (out of tank rotation,, soloing, etc..)  My magelo is almost up to date and should show my aggro weapons.  For DPS I currently use a &quot;Double Edged Ga Nak&quot; it has 48 damage, and 45 delay, poor stats, but if I am out of the tank rotation, do not care about too much about poor stats, soloing, I do care about stats.  I am not elemental flagged, and do not have any flags for GoD zones<br />
<br />
1.  Are there any good 1-2 groupable dps weapons I should be trying for?  I am very  interested in OOW, there have been some nice weapons.<br />
<br />
2.  I have not pursued many AAs that increas my DPS.  After I do the general DPS AAs (off in the future, not done wiht defensive AAs), should I pursue a track of doing AAs that help 1H, or 2H?<br />
<br />
3.  Plat is not an issue for me, and have been quite succesful in bazaar, but have not been impressed with 2hs weapons available.<br />
<br />
The vast majority of my time is spent in Xp groups where I am MA.  A small amount of time I spen in xp groups where I am SA, or in open raids.  Guild raiding is now almost non existant, but if it does raid, I am MA.<br />

Is in the Vazaelle bazaar right now for 180k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frostpaw</div><div class="date">10-01-2004, 07:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd probably grab a velium gemmed 2hander out of bazaar and call it good. GSo4W better dps, and free if you're into taking down Auliffe in BoT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sirphoenix_18</div><div class="date">10-01-2004, 08:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anyone mind linking the stats from the Edge?  I'm at work and almost all EQ sites are blocked out.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />

I'd probably use it over GSo4W just for the nicer stats; the dps gained or lost between the two is minimal</div></div><hr />

It seems to be the rare because out of the 15+ named I have killed down there I have only seen one of them drop.  Very nice DPS weapon though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Timothian</div><div class="date">10-02-2004, 08:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks all.  I like EoE that was listed above.  It is currently in my bazaar for 100k.  It has damage of 44, delay 34, AC 20, HP 135, 100 pnt Direct Damage process, +12 to most resists, and some decent stats.  Think I will continue to camp out in WoS and hope one drops.<br />

(Edit, duh, the stats are listed above, I should read a little closer)</div></div><hr />
