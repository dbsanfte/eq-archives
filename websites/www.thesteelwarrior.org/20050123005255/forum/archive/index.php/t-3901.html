<br />
Anyway, i know the common items i can get from bazaar for ears , fingers neck, waist &amp; back etc, but for the main armour slots - chest, legs, bracers, arms, hands &amp; helm - is there anything new on the market that i can pick up that will at least keep me alive in ele planes - not tanking of course.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you can, see if you can get some PL takish groups for about 40 groups =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Saeborne</div><div class="date">10-29-2003, 07:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That is a really interesting question, Raun.  I have know clue what the actual answer is.  <br />
<br />
If you were to use adventure points to buy the group temperance spell, that spell would carry over to the new server.  If you used the points to buy a piece of armor, that armor would not make the transfer.  So as far as unused points, you could argue it both ways...<br />
<br />
My hunch?  I would guess the points dissappear.  Everything else about transfering servers is a major Pain in the A$$.  I couldn't see Sony doing anything that would remotely encourage server transfers... or make them any easier.<br />
