I recently got 60, have decent ac/hp, and I want to get flagged. If anyone has a link to a guide that is good or other information they want to post, I'd really appreciate it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">05-19-2003, 03:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, the bad news is that the tank plays about the least important role in the trials. All you have to do is get in the way of the exe while the rest of the party beats the crap out of him.<br />
<br />
All of the trials are basically about DPS. The more DPS your group can crank out, the better. Being that my main is a wizard, I am partial to the AE approach, but straight nuke the shit out of the target the MT has targeted works well too.<br />
<br />
Here is what you need to do basically -<br />
1. Get the casters all in the corner opposite the platform, opposite the side with the exit mob. Plant yourself between the casters and where the mobs spawn in the benches.<br />
<br />
2. Sit down until the mobs spawn. This is a sure way to get all 4 mobs to jump you.<br />
<br />
3. Target mobs fast, F8 is your friend. If you can, try to get the rock mobs first since they are not mezzable.<br />
<br />
4. When the executioner spawns, you may be called on to kite him while the casters regen mana. If this is the case, make sure that no one has any pets up, the Exe has an AE that will agro pets and you don't want him summoning. Run him around the platform. I haven't done it since the pathing changes, but it should still be easy to kite him with run3.<br />
<br />
IMO you are best off getting wizards or mages for DPS because they have burst damage that melees are going to have a hard time matching. You will need:<br />
<br />
1. Tank - you<br />
2. Healer - cleric is best, druid or shammy ok<br />
3. Slower/crowd control - enchanter is best, bard will do<br />
4. Wiz/Mage<br />
5. Wiz/Mage<br />
6. anyone<br />
<br />
I have done the exe trial successfully at least a couple dozen times with that type group make up and it works very well.<br />
<br />
***** DISCLAIMER ******<br />
Except in the #6 wildcard spot, everyone needs to be 60+ and preferably 65. The higher your average level of your group, the easier the trials are in general.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">krunt</div><div class="date">05-19-2003, 03:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Everyone needs to be 60+ perferably 65.... sorry i just hate that mentality.  Why not just say, make sure everyone has primals, is 65 with at least 100aa and all VT geared up before you try.  Just a waste of time to post stuff like that.<br />
<br />
But he did have some good tips in there.  At 60 a group that knows how to play can do ex.  Just grab the first rock guy you can find, have the enchanter mez the rest and go to town on it.  Don't bother slowing them,  a 60 cleric should be able to keep up just fine.  However at 61 (i think) they get a more mana effectient heal over time that will realy help a cleric if they are going oom by the third or fourth wave.<br />
<br />
As a warrior your job is to grab the rocks, and grab them fast.  Taunt what you can, after the rocks go down grab the next mob, try and postion it for rogue backstabs or just keep it near the casters so when they grab agro you don't have to run far to taunt it off.  When the ex pops you should be fine going straight into the fight, just pop defensive and your set.  He is by far easier then the 4 waves to get to him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gallerus</div><div class="date">05-19-2003, 05:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The absolute best group I was ever in trials with was: magex2 warriorx2 cleric bard.  The warriors had over 100 pts of dshield each thanks to mage/bard/10thring/etc, mages both assisted 1 warrior &amp; sent pets &amp; nuked.  We had absoluetly obscene amounts of downtime between waves.<br />
<br />
bard &gt; chanter in exe trial by far.  Can mez mobs just as well + you get dshield &amp; mana song - just buy haste &amp; c3+ in nexus before going to poj.<br />
<br />
Nukers should stand next to the mt while nuking, so the mob doesnt ping pong around if they draw agro, same deal for cleric, should positioned so that the mob will not move if you get heal agro.<br />
<br />
Like wandor said, warrior + magex2 + cleric + bard can get any 6th person through exe trial with ease.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tinuvil</div><div class="date">05-19-2003, 10:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Casters have to nuke at melee distance - a ping-ponging mob is almost certain failure.<br />
Grab targets as fast as you can but still take your time to taunt before you break.<br />
Use modrods after 1st wave so you can use them a 2nd time.<br />
Pets can tank the next mob in line instead of assisting when you got enough DPS - instead of assisting.<br />
Get named ones first.<br />
Scream when youre tashed asap and let the healer cure it.<br />
KEI for the casters is a must.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomb</div><div class="date">05-19-2003, 10:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Best group i had was the one that flagged my cleric at 60.<br />
Group was <br />
65 warrior(not me)<br />
65 bard<br />
65 necro<br />
65 enchanter<br />
58 rogue<br />
60 cleric (me)<br />
<br />
Cleric was at 70% mana after trial.<br />
<br />
Mobs went down so fast we had lots of med time between the spawns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lessiter1</div><div class="date">05-19-2003, 10:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">AoE works wonderfully..<br />
<br />
I went through the trials 12 or 13 times to flag friends when PoP first came out..  <br />
<br />
The group makeup was:<br />
<br />
Warrior<br />
Cleric<br />
Enchanger<br />
Mage<br />
Mage<br />
Insertrandomclasshere<br />
<br />
Never failed.  The cleric and I were 61 at the time, the enchanter was 60, and both mages were 61.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frodlin7th</div><div class="date">05-19-2003, 11:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">2 Warriors<br />
Paladin<br />
Bard<br />
Druid or Mage<br />
Cleric<br />
<br />
With that group, I've beaten every one of the 6 trials repeatedly.   A big ol damage shield from Mage or Druid + Damage shield potion, + Bard AE dots +/shield on bard and pally and mobs literally melt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">05-19-2003, 02:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Everyone needs to be 60+ perferably 65.... sorry i just hate that mentality. <br />
<br />
What mentality is that? I gave him a 5 man group set up to beat any of the trials with ease. If you have people &gt;60 you will fail. The spell selection is of great importance and since 4/5 spots I listed are casters then the level of the people in the group matters a lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbo Baggins</div><div class="date">05-19-2003, 08:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">use search (http://steelwarrior.xwarzone.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=421)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yroc Morf</div><div class="date">05-20-2003, 02:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One point not being noted..... Kiting the PEV has changed (I can confirm this with certainty).<br />
<br />
I would be interested to hear of any recent experiences and strats.  Since the changes we have just been taking the PEV right away because he is jumping up and over the table now.<br />
<br />
This is my exe strat guide/info.  It should help you with some pretty good details (AE only) (http://pub99.ezboard.com/fwave99244frm8.showMessage?topicID=6.topic)<br />
<br />
If you have any info that can help this guide... feel free to post on my web site.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kabal</div><div class="date">05-20-2003, 04:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know alot of this has been said above already but in my opinion the best group non AE style is :<br />
<br />
Warrior<br />
Cleric<br />
Chanter<br />
Mage<br />
Mage or wizard  ( also have used rog/ranger)<br />
any 55-56 or above character<br />
<br />
Now in the above model you have a basic core group of 5 and room to sub in any one random class. My guild started doing this when the core group was about 62-63 and we did ok...now we are all 65 and the 5 of us alone can do the trials np... we have used the above combination to flag all of our members and alts in our guild (about 40 flagged). <br />
<br />
Now as far as actual tanking strategy goes...<br />
<br />
When we go in I sit in the middle of the benches i use a wide view so that i can see myself and all 4 spawn points then as soon as they pop i take a split second glance hit F9 (which changes me back to first person) then target the nearest rock and attack, if there are no rocks i target the nearest mob and go.  The rest assist me and attack....as i am fighting i usually spin the mobs around so that i can see my next target clearly..watch your text box not the screen for the kill...you will see the yellow experience text before you see the mob fall over....as soon as you that text your next target should be in front of you if you spun correctly and you hit F8 and attack. repeat this process till all are dead. Then repeat for next waves. Also be SURE that all casters stay real close to you....you really dont want one of em to heal or nuke or break a mez and the mob takes off running after them...if they stay real close to you and they get aggro all that should happen is the mob spins around to them....tell them to stay put and you taunt like mad to get aggro back....whatever they do dont let your casters get far away from you. <br />
<br />
Now if your group dps is good enough to make it to round 4....<br />
<br />
as the last mob dies have the group move back towards the guard in the corner...then if you need to kite go up to the stairs as the last one dies and exec will aggro ya...run him around the stage if ya can...have someone call out if he stops or changes directions on ya.....don't hit him either or he will summon you and your kiting will be pointless as the cleric has to heal ya....the best class to kite is a chanter or a wiz with some aggro spell...just dont do dmg....anyway either you've kited him or you havent'....your about to engage him....just go up attack go defensive and taunt like mad...you shouldn't ever lose aggro on him...watch out at the end he will enrage so don't plow. Loot your mark and have fun...<br />
<br />
OK i think thats it....if i missed something sorry....there are lots of group combos that can pass and strats that work...this just happens to be the one that my friends and I use.<br />
<br />
Good Luck to you and if you fail keep trying you'll get there!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Derrict</div><div class="date">05-21-2003, 02:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">People should try some of the other trials.  IMO hanging is easier than execution.  You have 3 mobs that spawn, air/water elemental type mobs and razorfiend type mob.  The razorfiend type mob is unmezzable and proc whirl til you hurl, so they need TMing.  Kill the spirit of suffocation each time it spawns and you'll get the boss eventually.  Mobs will continue spawn regardless if you have all 3 mobs cleared.  This trial is more crowd control than dps but dps does help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kiya</div><div class="date">05-21-2003, 06:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not everyone needs to be 60+.  Both my warrior and cleric are flagged.  Cleric made it thru the exe trial at level 58 just fine.  My warrior passed the exe trial with a 57 cleric in the group.  =p<br />
The best luck I have is with healer, tank, rogue, rogue, ranger, ench/bard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yroc Morf</div><div class="date">05-21-2003, 06:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">so they need TMing <br />
<br />
What is TMing</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rodney</div><div class="date">05-28-2003, 06:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are many many ways to beat this, dont get stuck on one way.   So far eveyone has said take the rocks first, this is not always right,  while rocks are not mezable they are rootable.  The past 5 times I have passed the trials we did not mez the mobs or even slow.  If your not going to mez then leave the rocks for last.  A good damage shield is the key,  my log showed over 175 dps on the first mob, 70 from me and 105 from the DS.    Dont wast time looking for the right mob take the nearest and kill it fast, while killing the first one use the other views to find your next target.   The MA makes or breaks this fight, you screw up with your target its all over.   <br />
<br />
    Did this again last week for a guildie and the Exe is a bit of a pain but no real problem to kite and yes he does run over the platform, I lost half a bar of health till the casters were ready.<br />
<br />
Just my two coppers<br />
