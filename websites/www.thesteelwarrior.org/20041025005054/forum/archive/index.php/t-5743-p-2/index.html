<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Graal the Dorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I would LOVE to see any tank with under 7k buffed tank the Kod'Taz trials &quot;fairly easily&quot;.<br />
<br />
A warrior with max +hp AAs, max stamina, and fully buffed at level 65 will have about 6700 hp with zero(0) +hp gear. NONE. Zilch. Nada. Of course a warrior is not likely to max STA without getting some sort of +hp gear and he is goign to have essentially no AC. <br />
<br />
Give that same warrior an average of 50 hp per slot and he is above 7900 hp buffed. Give him an average of 100 hp per slot (ssra/VT level) and he is at 9100-9200 hp fully buffed. An average of 125 hp per item is roughly 9750 hp. This does NOT include the sturdiness AA, btw.<br />
<br />
Does anyone REALLY believe that knights would have even been considered to tank AD, Bert, RD, or even MB 10 days in to PoP? I think not.<br />
<br />
What do these raid level mobs have to do with single group content?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zotha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Frodlin said:<br />
Tanking isn't nearly the same. There is no valuable secondary role for Paladins, and the SK DPS difference from warriors is *tiny* with the exception of their one burst DPS ability. In other words, they UNLIKE priests don't being additional value to the group, JUST AS warriors didn't bring enough additional value to groups when their best method of generating aggro was to ask the pope to pray on their behalf. <br />
<br />
Paladins bring many valuable things to these groups, spot healing, rampage tanking, secondary res, secondary tanking, root, group heals, etc etc. SKs on the other hand are not a *tiny* dps difference as you state. The SKs in my guild are quite capable of pumping out 210+ dps without factoring in HT. Last I checked im not doing anywhere near that, despite having pretty good shit and every DPS aa except the 2 new ones. <br />
<br />
You might want to parse your SKs sometime, though theyre probably keeping quiet with you around in fear of you going on a righteous crusade when you realize how much damage they really do.</div></div><hr />

I'm not going to comment on knight viablity in Innkiz, because I can't.  I have no experience with it yet, so don't try to read anything into what I'm posting.   (I underlined that and made it bold, because it's important)<br />
<br />
I do, however, think it's more than just a little pointless to compare raid content from other expanions, where there's no real restrictions on who/how many you can bring, to single group content.   On a raid, it doesn't really matter if a few people don't pull their weight and contribute only a tiny fraction of what everyone else does.<br />
<br />
But once you look at 6-man encounters , each person's role is infinately more vital.  If it is the case that in content limited to 6 people, that some classes aren't able to pull their weight or contribute on par with everyone else, that would be a problem.   And please, don't go into the &quot;I'm a paladin and I can't do it&quot; or the &quot;I'm a warrior but we have paladins in our guild that have done it&quot; diatribes again, that stuff has been hashed over a hundred times already.  I'm saying IF.  <br />
<br />
But regardless of if that's true or not, it has little bearing on 50-60 person raid encounters of previous expansions, so comparisons between the two are worthless.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm sorry, but I can't let some idiot make The Tribunal look worse that it is.  It's rather sad really how far our server is behind when compared to others, but the brave Barraind is neither number one on his server, or even in his own guild.  Top of the server rankings have not been in his hands in 6 months, but even our server best barely breaks the tope 100 overall in most of the catagories listed.  (Big grats on UMR of 17 though, server best!)<br />
<br />
The Tribunal only has a handful of 10k paladins, most of which have the brains not to come to the warrior boards and stir up shit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Originally posted by Furor <br />
Kod'Taz and beyond were designed to be a playground for TIME+ level characters. <br />
<br />
(2) Because of (1), mudflation has not even begun to seep into and through the classes. <br />
<br />
(3) Over time, as tactics are refined and these trials are better understood, more AA's are gained, and better loot is earned through the raids, the trials will become doable by non-prime groups.<br />
<br />
  <br />
<br />
I don't really see much of mudinflation seeing all the items that are toward high end Time loot comes from after passing the trials.  The content up to Ikkinz gives you a chance to get some decent augments if you didn't do LDoN raids (and I suspect most didn't) but it isn't going to make your Knight a powerful tanking machine overnight.  Even a Time level Knight is going to have problem tanking these and GoD won't remedy that.<br />
<br />
Now after the loot past Ikkinz rolls out it may very well Knights become overpowered again, but on the way to Ikkinz, I don't see how Knights can manage it.  I do not think they need to be readjusted but it makes me wonder what's a Knight's purpose if he cannot tank.  Since a lot of your group is already tied up on support in those trials I don't see too much viablity for Knights.  Granted you don't make group solely on that, but the trails are already hard enough.  As a warrior I'm going to be permanently tied to trial groups and I wouldn't mind if they could at least do some of them (though I guess Knights could do #2 and #3... certainly #3 after the Lockout mob is cleared).  <br />
<br />
As for learning about these trials, I do not think there's much you can learn about the random named that hits for 2200.  You can only heal so fast.  The only strat I can see is that maybe people will have a team of 3 monks with SoT and WA5 to swap in before you pulled a named.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zotha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Incidently, our first group to try Ikkiniz had a paladin tank, and 1 cleric+1druid as healing. This paladin is maybe 4th or 5th best equipped on the server maybe lower. They got to the final named before wiping. This isnt impossible, you dont need 2 fucking clerics to do it. Had I been there instead, they might have won.. but then again for a first try with 0 spoilers its not too bad for a PALADIN to tank all the way to the final mob. Quit the bitching, its hard and youll be thankful its hard when the 2nd and 3rd tier guilds get to Time and start looking for shit to do on their other 6 days of the week.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Diotrum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">&quot;but it makes me wonder what's a Knight's purpose if he cannot tank&quot;<br />
<br />
Our purpose now is to be 2nd to warriors.  This is the warrior expansion, go ahead and get used to it.  Properly equipped knights can easily tank through trial 6 in a good group, but now requires an additional healer where it didn't in PoP.  Group balance is now crucial to success again, something we haven't seen in a long, LONG time.  <br />
<br />
Gone are the days of &quot;we have 4 good follks, pick up anyone for the last 2&quot;.  Utility is now a must.  Knights better be able to do more than try to be a warrior to succeed in GoD.</div></div><hr />

Right now that's what I'm seeing here. We're far more capable of doing the job, but warriors can get thru(sic) it with more aggro restraint from their group members. I don't think the fucking world is going to end.<br />
<br />
IF that had been the paladin response 6 months ago, what would you have said?  <br />
<br />
An invalid comparison, as you are comparing a single encounter now to the entire game then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I would LOVE to see any tank with under 7k buffed tank the Kod'Taz trials &quot;fairly easily&quot;.Correction - I meant 7k UNbuffed. At 7k unbuffed a warrior will buff to 9.4khp assuming max STA unbuffed. 9.4khp unbuffed is really pushing it even for a warrior. The point is it takes over 10k buffed bare minimum. Considering the top warriors are hitting over 12k and top knights are hitting 11.5k I don't think it is unreasonable for someone with ONLY 10khp to have a hard time.<br />
<br />
What do these raid level mobs have to do with single group content?The point is that while the Kod'Taz trials are 6 man trials, they are still raid level content, regardless of how many people get to go in. The parallel in the comparison is that knights had to preogress well beyond those mobs before they where able to tank them.<br />
<br />
Now after the loot past Ikkinz rolls out it may very well Knights become overpowered again, but on the way to Ikkinz, I don't see how Knights can manage it.Traditionally knights have ALWAYS had to progress past raid level content in order to tank it effeciently. Judging by the level of the loot out of Ikkinz, I would say that knight are going to be just fine once people get past it.</div></div><hr />

God mode sucks ass. It amazes me how soft people have gotten since PoP released. For months people have complained that EQ is dead, mudflation has killed the game, there is no challenge left. SOE gives us some bad ass content that we can't steamroll and people complain even more. Grow a pair and figure out how to beat this shit instead of complaining about it, you might find that it's a lot more fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Moozilla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I have no complaint with the difficulty of GoD. It's LARGELY less user friendly as far as the lack of graveyards and the umm, crappy places corpses pop after failed expeditions causing summon corpse to be highly needed heh. My guild has quite a few knights above the 10k barrier. Thus far they haven't even attempted to try to tank kod trials, a few did tank vxed and tipt. Mostly I just hear a large amount of whining from them which I'll spare you the details of. Here's my whine. I dread having to do this single group content with the same 5 people just to push 1 person through. I have a severe beef with those whom shall remain nameless that had the beta info, used it to push their guild through the crap, then complain that it was too easy and get it changed into the PITA that it is now. Thanks dick. IMO getting into kod is too easy though. We have people on my server without time access in kod now...what good do type 8 augs do for them? not a bit but they're still there. Honestly I would like to see it harder to get into and then become raid content...Diabolic Destroyer is pretty rough in it's current content and I'd rather not have to do this thing repeatedly. How about a RAID flag mob ala smith to bypass KT trials. Make it quad 3k I don't mind....just give us the option of raiding to avoid single group over and over and over. Single group would be nice if it was the punishment for the people that didn't make the raids to get flagged...</div></div><hr />

This is what i'm worried about &amp; if its true like I fear, will probably be what kills eq for me to be honest.  The idea of instanced, single group flags is great - you dont have to worry about having 60-70 people online to get flagged, you can go at your own pace, always available, etc.  When those single group events basically dictate the presence of 4-5 certain classes though it ruins the whole thing.</div></div><hr />

This is sorta like the PoJ trials. When PoP first came out, classes without maximal efficiency were often struggling for that 6th spot. Now, you don't even need a slower really. Mind you, this is an obviously different situation, however you have to consider if this will become true at all. I suspect they're planning ahead some, to make this content still difficult for guilds who are majorly outfitted. This isn't a definite bad thing, give it a little while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>arbosch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">This thread only show that warriors dont need to be smart.<br />
<br />
1.) Forget the idea this is another PoP where we was unable to do stuff at the start and then later we was able to do it. There are 2 reasons why this will not happen. 1.) We dont got 5 more levels. 2.) We dont got a real upgrade in our power. No class got a real upgrade in GoD. So we will not get a big increase in power. No class will get a great increase in powers only from the new kills. They are eyecandy but not real increases in power. <br />
<br />
2.) I am a paladin and aslong this trials are only there to flag people i dont have a problem with it that only warrior can tank it and only warrior will tank them in futur. Even when knights are 'able' to tank them. No guild will send in groups with knights when they have a 50% chance to win or loose. Even with 1 knight, 4 clerics and slower you will have a 50% chance. Because it is not the casual damage which kill us. It is the bad round where the mob hit for 2200, 2200, 2200, 2200, 2200.... Damage spikes kill us and this can happen or not. It is only a question of luck if you win with a knight or not. If you are lucky you get good melee rounds and you survive. You have bad luck and get a damm bad round and he oneround you in 5 seconds bevor a healer can react. Defensiv help against this speaks because it give the healers time to react when this spikes happen. But again aslong it is only for trials and not normal for (exp) nameds i dont see a problem when only warrior can tank them. You have to make this trials 40 or 50 times to get the guild flagged which i think is a positiv thing for us knights :p.<br />
<br />
3.) You guys dont know a shit about paladins. Personal that they made this trials that hard is the best reason to take a knight with you but not as tank. This trials are damm hard and we are the best class to support a groupe. This damm hard trials lets us us all our skills because you can be sure that shit will happen mostly. If something is easy we are nothing else then gimped warriors because we dont need our tools. If something is damm hard we are a great help for the groupe. The reason most knights want to be tanks was, that the game was to easy and so the only way to get in a groupe was as tank. If the 'support' role get a real 'role' i dont see a problem to play this role. But then it need to be damm hard for both. Then i will see that warriors can get onerounded to because then you will see that they look for support groups. Which can play different rolse which can tank if needed. But for that the game is still to easy. For warriors this nameds are to easy because your disciplines. Noone can tell me it is hard to hit ripost dispell, slow the mob then and tank him with defensiv to end. You can not get onerouned and so the only way that you fail is when somoene make an error. The only way that support groupe get a real role is when the stuff get harder. if the warrior can get onerounded to like a knight you will look that you have a 2. tank there and a 2. warrior will be useless so you will look for a 'support' class. But i am allso sure that the warriors will not like this when they will die like knights  now. When you can get onerouned. So if you dont want to make the support class role a important role you have to live with that kgihts will be tanks and so should be able to tank this mobs. Because aslong the support role is not a needed role in groups we are nothing else then gimped warriors.<br />

I think Kodtaz would be a great zone for elemental people.  Items do drop from named that have type 8 augment slots.  <br />

I think the one group trials are the best method I have seen used in a long time to keep undergeared people out of the next zone.   Even the gatekeepers (RZ) in PoP were fairly easy for 60 NToV early ssra geared people.</div></div><hr />

This isnt pop though with another 5 levels &amp; tons of good aas to get though.  Right now the only way to prepare for this stuff is to farm the hell outta time - which means you need to have 70-90 people in your guild so you can get in &amp; farm it - all so you can pass a buncha 6 man trials to unlock raid content thats capped at 54 people ? bleh <br />
<br />
6 months from now time level guilds are going to have the same issue that time level guilds are faced with now - very tight restrictions on class makeup for trials, which means your chanters / shaman / warriors / clerics are going to have to do these for each for each wizard / ranger / paladin / sk / druid / bst / mage / rogue / necro you have.<br />
<br />
The prospect of having to do all these trials numerous times to ferry people through has the potential to make pop reflagging look fun - I mean for the classes required to get through these its gonna be more work than fun &amp; for the not required classes its gonna suck ass having wait for people to pull you through.<br />

Nearly every expansion has had content more difficult than the expansion before it. Raids didn't march into Trakanon's Lair in the first month of Kunark with Warriors wearing Crafted Armor and win.<br />
<br />
After my 10th death in my first raid to kill Trak and over six hours of false starts, CR, and wipeouts he finally died and coughed up a BP.<br />
<br />
Afaik, nobody one grouped Juggernaughts three weeks into that expansion..<br />
<br />
I'm a Warrior. As long as General Reparm can one round any Warrior they won't be allowed to MT him. Oh wait, he still can and guilds do have Warriors MT him. Your arguement is demonsterably false.<br />
<br />
Guilds already have Paladins MT mobs that can one-round them - Warriors too.<br />
<br />
Paladins aren't a support class. They are Tanks. A Warrior's set of skills are designed to help them tank the hardest hitting mobs. A Paladin's set of skills is to tank, buff, heal, help with crowd control, etc.<br />
<br />
No doubt those going to hunt down a named mob in GoD that hits hard will seek out a Warrior to MT, just like they have in every expansion since Kunark. Those looking for a steady stream of experiance will add a Paladin since they can MT in an experiance group just fine and the value of being able to res a dead Cleric alone in one of those instanced zones is huge.<br />
<br />
If your guild has cleared PoTime 25 or 30 times, I'm expecting that you will be able to tell us stories about your GoD guild raids in the near future. If you aren't clearing PoTime a lot you might not be geared up for a new and more difficult expansion.<br />

Frodlin, theres a flaw with your endurance/mana drain idea, maybe you were and maybe you weren't aware of it, honestly I don't know but It's worth bringing to your attention.  Without mana Knight aggro is extremly weak.  I couldn't keep aggro off my healers were that change to go in.  While 2h weapons will provide better aggro chances are Knights who could make it to thtough trials, provided they arent trivial, would be needing to go 1h/shield for the tanking power.  While this on it's own isn't a bad thing I would like to point out that thanks to Brodda's and my own aggro parsing a few months ago it is obvious that bash is extremly minor aggro and that a BoC is more aggro than the Knight 1h weapons from time.  For this reason I think that you need to seek an alternative to a mana drain, how about +1000% mana cost on spells 2.5 sec casting or less?  This would allow Knights to use some higher cast time spells for taunt still, with the speed this mob hits aggro will be a noticeable amount lower than with our normal spells but it should be manageable, Warrior aggrou would be far beyond what that we would be able to do, but we would be able to hold aggro off the heals with that.  I personally feel that these Knight (and all hybrid really) issues with GoD need addressed, but at this point I would take any help I can get.  Won't even post how fast things like Chavoor the Trickster, Umbiki, Hexxt Bonegrinder, etc... can knock me out, it's embarrasing really.<br />
<br />
PS. Under no circumstances do I want these encounters made any easier, I just want my class and Paladins to be a bit more desireable in them, so far I've felt like a liability in every group I've done from Vxed/Tipt (named) and up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">You know what is a little curious Brael is that the first attempt where you died much sooner, the mob was doing a lot less damage than the 2nd attempt. Apparently your healers woke up the second time ;)<br />
<br />
At any rate, just like I keep saying over and over, top end knights can tank this shit. Brael being an SK is even more indicative because pallies have the distinct advantage of being able to heal themselves much better than life taps can for an SK which frees a group spot for DPS. This seems to have been offset by the group makeup, but certainly cleric + druid + shammy + ranger + rogue + SK is pretty non-standard. I would imaging that replacing the SK with a pally and the druid with a mage/wiz/rog/BL would have shortened the fight considerably, which usually brings the success rate up.<br />
<br />
I would be interested to know if just the cleric and either the druid or the shammy would have been able to heal you without the 3rd priest. With the cleric chain SLing for 800 dps healed, the back up healer would need to be able to keep up with 600 dps or so.<br />
<br />
In another month top end knights will be tanking these with high success rates, in 3 months people will wonder why we thought these where so hard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Brael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Actually Wandor, I parsed the heals as well and was healed roughly the same each time.  A spike is what killed me that first attempt and very nearly killed me the second attempt (My hp were below 50.. not to be confused with % 3 times, I even went unconscious once).  Surviving the fight was pure luck, and I didn't even live to see it die.  The main reason I posted those parses were to show you what Knights were taking for comparison, despite being able to tank it with 1 of each priest class in my group I do feel that is a bit much and would like to see something done about it.  I could not have survived that fight with any less heals than I had, I was lifetapping also, a Paladin would have needed just as much.  Mobs really can knock me out cold in the blink of an eye, could post a Hexxt Bonegrinder parse, fucker knocked me out cold in under 3 seconds.<br />
<br />
The heals being used on me were SL, Infusion, Tnargs btw.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Graal the Dorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Wander, you dont' seriously think a paladin's heals or an SKs lifetaps amount to much against these mobs do you? <br />
<br />
Average DPS doesn't really mean squat. It is the spikes that kill you, not the average.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Actually Grall I've always disagreed with that point of view. With many mobs Clerics heal for the worst case. Because Cleric healing even on a fixed timer can be bumpy due to lag, patch healers watch and add heals anytime there looks to be a delay in healing and the MT is not already at max HP's.<br />
<br />
Using DI not only tries to handle a lucky streak on the part of the mob, but a lack of smoothness in the healing rotation.<br />
<br />
So yes, not a lot of help but some help as would be weilding a SeWs or Hopebringer.<br />
<br />
Most Tanks can absorb a quad for 2k each hit  - provided thay are at or near max HP's when they get it.<br />
<br />
The goal is to keep the tank at or near max HP's and not run out of mana.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>arbosch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Personal i think the difficult is right when a knight tank them. With a warrior it is to easy. Ripost and defensiv compo take out all the risk from this. You can not fail when you us this aslong you dont make an error. He cant oneround you and even a not time geared warrior is able to tank them which is a sign that it is to easy.<br />
<br />
Me problem with this trials is, that they are to easy with a warrior. Aslong it keep that easy with warriors everyone will us warriors. Aslong warriors dont need a support class we need to be able to tank them. We are a little between 2 roles. For tanking the difference between a warrior and knight is to large and for support class there isnt really a need for if you have a warrior. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">How many times do I have to repeat that there is no power upgrade in this expansion prior to Ikkinz?  Knights get 0 tanking AAs in GoD.  Maybe it'll be easy after you get stuff beyond Ikkinz but that's not the point.  It is not important if Knights can tank these trivially after post Ikkinz gear, because the Ikkinz trials are not designed for post-Ikkinz gear for sure.  <br />
<br />
There's nothing you can do to the way to Ikkinz that will make it any easier 3 months from now.  The mobs still do that much damage and the Knights at the level expected to take on those encounters still only has that much HP/AC.  <br />
<br />
Brael is a Time-level SK.  3 months later, another Time-level SK isn't going to have any more HP than he had (assuming roughly same amount of gear up).  Unless you count on people having 5 Quarm loot and use that as your argument, these trials aren't going to become any easier.  Your healers won't mysteriously be able to heal more damage.  The Knights won't suddenly get more HP/AC.  So tell me, how is this supposed to be easier?<br />
<br />
For the naysayers I don't think you even have a clue how hard these mobs are.  There is no skill involved in tanking or healing these whatsoever.  You just heal as fast as you possibly can and hope you don't get unlucky.  There's no way you can refine that kind of strategy with any amount of practice.  The best cleric in the world can't do the 'chain spam SL' strategy any better than any EBayed whatever.  We are already at the maximum efficiency possible to deal with these encounters because the sheer DPS the named puts out prevents any other strategy.  I've said it many times but if a strategy exists it is having 3 monks with SoT and WA5 which will drastically drop the named's DPS with Time Rend (at 3 proc/minute that's roughly 9 second of stun, which is 15% stunned).  Every time Time Rend goes off I know I have 3 more seconds for my healers to catch up on heals, and when you look at a mob that dishes out 1000 DPS disced, that's basically 3K damage mitigated per Time Rend.<br />
<br />
No one here is saying these should be easier, but having a Knight should not be a liabliity.  Currently it is.  I do not see any reason to want a Paladin for a good portion of any trials, and SK only for a quick HT on where it is really needed (like trial 2 bosses).  This may be what is intended, and it may even be fine, but it's going to be really boring for a lot of classes.  For that matter, as a Warrior, I don't want to be stuck doing these trials forever, either.</div></div><hr />

We killed the Tipt boss guy (hearstalker something) with warrior tanking and only a druid healing (Cleric died on inc, doh!) and we have also killed him with an SK tanking (Although, the SK died hehe).<br />
<br />
But, in general I have to agree, the knights got the shaft a little in this expansion, they are still the supreme offtankers on raids etc, but in one group encounters, they are simply not as viable tank anylonger. I always liked a knight as a secondary tank in the group though, but I am a bit odd that way =)</div></div><hr />

Yep, but you will get the, and you can quote me on this &quot;lifeless, I am obsessed/addictive person playing EQ&quot; Knights bitching they should be able to tank CURRENT content.

<br />
Also at this point I WOULD want a Paladin in my group doing Tipt trials.  Right now if you have 1 cleric and 1 warrior, a death of either at any point of the adv MOSTLY means just leave expedition and let corpses pop and try again.  Add a paladin in and they can get aggro and tank if the warrior gets an unlucky hit and die.  And if the cleric dies they can res the cleric and continue the adv.  I've had loses to both cases already.</div></div><hr />

That is the ultimate response. &quot;You should have made a warrior if you wanted to tank&quot; or similar. If you are talking about tanking raid level boss mobs, almost every single paladin in the game would agree with you. When you are talking about single group content...well, it's pretty much an admission of imbalance.</div></div><hr />

This the role most paladins actually prefer (SKs I don't know). We wouldn't have any problem at all if this was workable. We rarely get groups to fill this role. When you have a 6 person limit and start looking at the required classes, there aren't alot of filler spots left.<br />
<br />
2 healers (minimum)<br />
warrior<br />
enchanter<br />
<br />
I would think that groups would prefer to fill those last 2 spots with DPS.<br />
<br />
You have a very valid point about the stackability of multiple warriors. I don't see why they are that much less stackable than multiple paladins, to be honest. Paladins are great for healing incidental damage, but not the focused damage.<br />
<br />
If you mention heals, I challenge you to go through just the sewer trial with a shaman slower (who doesn't heal you at all) and have 3 paladins be your healers. Try it and see how well it works.</div></div><hr />

I don't think people were saying those augs improve Paladins with respect to Warriors - they will improve vs. the trial we are discussing.<br />
<br />
Your post previous to mine shows how silly such a discusion can get.<br />
<br />
As a Warrior I get things like Defensive. You get things like Brells SS, heals, root, etc. INSTEAD of what I get.<br />
<br />
This is not PoP anymore. It isn't necessarily true that Paladins will be able to tank everything that Warriors could like PoTime. Matter of fact, SoE added some mitigation and the Sturdyness AA's so that this would not happen.<br />
<br />
This difference in tanking ability is going to be most apparent in a 6 man group where a CH rotation with patch healers, chained Vie, and chained Runes are not available.<br />
<br />
As time goes on, some mobs, like those in the trial being discussed, will likely become trivial for Knights. Certainly well-equipped Knights can tank very well indeed. Other mobs, particularly hard hitting one group mobs, may be more difficult for Knights to tank particularly in a standard group until the next expansion comes out and GoD is trivial content.<br />

I'm sure there's a point there someplace, I just can't find it.  Why don't you take EVERYTHING you just said and replace 'Warrior' with 'Paladin' and 'HP from AA' with 'Aggro from spells' do you still have the same objection?  At the moment every time a warrior gets a new weapon upgrade we have to go to OLD CONTENT in order to continue doing our job of getting aggro.

This is how it is right now. Within a week the 'filler' role will be more loosely guarded. Within a month it will expand. Within 6 months these encounters will be no more difficult than LDON hard adventures.<br />
<br />
What is happening right now is that people are actually encountering FAILURE for the first time in a long time and for some of the newer 'uber wannabe' types, for the first time EVER. I spent 5 HOURS failing the newly revamped Ikkiniz 3 nights ago. FIVE hours. We ended up leaving after our 8th or so CR and went back the next day and literally WOOPED the DD our first attempt. That felt good. Damn good. <br />

After taking that into account the only thing I can conclude is that although Knights are needing some help with these it isn't nearly as drastic as some are making it out to be.  With that group an average timefarm+LDoN level Knight should be able to stand up to that about as well as I was, would say I'm hardly the average for that so an upgrade is warranted but nothing extreme like a defensive disc.  There is a problem however when assuming that DPS intake is a constant and that mana is infinite a Knight with my gear would die at 125 seconds.<br />
<br />
Would like to see some parses of Warriors tanking these same mobs (or Knights to if theres any others reading this thread that have done it or a similar mob) for comparison.</div></div><hr />

Actually, you should be the average SK hitting these trials. These trials are targetted for Time++ people, a SK who has not farmed Time for a large amount of Time should not even set foot in Ikkinz.<br />
<br />
Not to say that there might not be an imbalance with the fact that 75% of the classes are reduced to a filler role and have to share the last two spots in groups, but the gear you have, is the gear you are supposed to have if you want to beat these trials.</div></div><hr />

What is happening right now is that people are actually encountering FAILURE for the first time in a long time and for some of the newer 'uber wannabe' types, for the first time EVER.  <br />
<br />
I think this is true.  Some people think that if they execute correctly, they should have 100% chance of winning the encounter.  I guess it's a matter of opinion but I personally laugh outloud when something gets a lucky round and just blows the shit out of me, even if it means a big CR.  I think a little random element that is out of your control makes things more exciting.<br />
<br />
My unrelated point is that these trials are kind of new territory for the warrior vs. knight balance discussions.  The theory that Knights tank in exp groups and have a secondary role in raids doesn't fit with these trials.  They really are 1-group raids.  Given the party restrictions, I would say these are some of the toughest mobs to tank that we've seen so far.  I would bet that it is easier to tank Time Rallos Zek with 72 people and than it is to tank an Ikkinz trial with 6 people and, so in a way this is without a doubt current raid content for a tank.  Is this right?  I dunno, but these surely aren't exp groups.</div></div><hr />

How is this a problem? Why do you assume or presume that you should be able to tank everything and anything? <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, your attitude is wrong and your theory is flawed. This is not a problem but instead, exactly as it should be - giving you the benefit of the doubt and casting all thoughts of just how far off the mark you are aside, using your own numbers, if the Warrior dies, you can MAXIMALLY keep the Knight alive for 125 seconds. Hopefully your group can finish off the mob in that amount of time. This is not a negative, this is a positive. Without a Knight, the group would have wiped completely. You just bought your group 125 more seconds. Congratulations.<br />

As the expansion progresses and more and more 225+/Quarm+ loot is discovered, processed, and consumed, the trials themselves will become more trivial. As more data is gathered about the trials themselves and shortcuts are found, the trials themselves will become more trivial. It will be at this point when the Knight can fill the role of MT in these events, and also at this point that we can see just how much damage was done to the already annhilated foundation of the game. Asking for a class wide upgrade less than a month INTO an expansion is frankly noobiesh and pathetic. <br />

No, but I would consider it balanced for KNIGHT to need loot past RZ to be able to tank him effectively. Warriors tank the hard shit first, knights tank it later. That is the way it has always been, why should this be any different? This is of course completely discounting the fact that KNIGHTS ARE TANKING THIS SHIT ALREADY.

These trials are not experience grinds. They are not dungeon crawls. They are for all intents and purposes miniature raids. Your problem is that you are seriously misinformed (but what's new yea?) and think this is actually standard 'single group content' - which it is not. ONE person in your entire guild is required to be flagged for all 3 trials in order to start RAIDS. <br />

Requiring upgrades from current content to be capable of tanking is reasonable for Knights I feel.<br />
<br />
Furor, wether you want to call them 6 person raids or 6 person exp groups, or whatever the fact is you cannot reasonably expect to require a Warrior for 6 man content.  The guideline I'm going by to determine this is when you can expect atleast 2/3 of the games classes to be present it's reasonable to require a specific class (although I still don't believe its healthy for the game to require certain classes for anything unless all are required and as Kunark/Velious showed, you cannot make seperate important roles for as many classes as EQ has).  At the risk of sounding a bit overdramatic ever class except Knights can perform their primary job with a satisfactory result in these trials, they require a much lower level of gear as well.  If these trials could contain enough people where Warriors being a necessity for winning is a reasonable expectation then I could understand Knights being placed in offtanking, dps, healing, buffbitch (poor paladins) roles but in 6 person encounters it is not reasonable or fair for this to happen, it isn't fun either.  1/6 of your group should not be required to be a Warrior.  Heres a serious question for you Furor, if Warriors were a liability or regulated to their secondary role (dps) in these while Knights were being a necessity to win, would you not be screaming that it is unfair?  I know you would so if you put yourself in that posistion you will see where I'm coming from with this.<br />

<br />
Do you require a Warrior when you raid new content? The first time? The tenth time? The thirtieth time? Fiftieth?<br />
<br />
Ikkiniz instances are merely a microcosm of Everquest end gaming at large. By that logic, then, requiring Warriors should be a necessity not an exception or an option. To make these feasible for Knights to tank start to finish in effect shrinks the game instead of having any expansive effect. It brings content closer to all at too fast a rate, consequently reducing any and all risk in said event to nil. This is not good for Everquest. This is not good for any game.<br />

So by this standard, the mobs DPS should be adjusted so that a Druid can heal instead of a Cleric, right? Since 1/6th of the group shouldn't be made up of a specific class.<br />

Druids have utilty, just as *hybrid* Knights do. Druids can nuke, heal, and buff. Knights can pinch tank, heal, buff, and be a source of DPS.<br />

<br />
At the cost of that DPS advantage you say I have for my lack of tanking?  You completly overestimate the effect of riposte on Knights btw.  Even when using 1h I swing far slower and far less often (flurry, lower double attack, no innate triple attack, no dual weild).  Riposte effects on Knights are extremly minor and always have been, it's at most 1/4 as big a danger for Knights as it is for Warriors which pretty much reduces the danger of it to nothing.</div></div><hr />

On hard hitters, riposte is a significant amount of the damage a warrior takes. If knights truly take 1/4 the riposte damage a warrior does, then this would make up any advantage warriors have due to better defensive skills and mitigation.</div></div><hr />

Also, it goes back to the whole point Frodlin made with a huge discrepency in loot to be able to perform the job, in the case of a Knight top time gear, in the case of a Warrior it can be done in elemental gear.  10.7k hp 2350 ac Warrior does a far better job of tanking than a 10.7k hp 2650 ac knight, that alone is a huge difference (espically when you consider that warrior has 4 levels of sturdiness aa already), late ele/early time warrior vs late time knight yet the warrior out performs easily.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And so he should be. A fully geared Potime Druid, will NOT out-heal a elemental/early time Cleric. Not even close.<br />
<br />
Every class has their role, and in certain encounters, that role is called upon. Warriors tank. That's it. They provide nothing to a group aside from medicore DPS -- at best. Clerics heal, that's it -- they provide NOTHING to a group, if they aren't healing.<br />
<br />
You just have to learn to accept the fact, that for once, your class isn't capable of accomplishing a task that is balanced around the primary tank in the game: A Warrior. Start dumbing down the event, and making it Knight tankable, and the encounter becomes highly trivial if you use a Warrior tank instead of a Knight. Is that what you want? Trivial encounters, just so YOU can tank it? That's bad for the integrity of the game, and shouldn't be happening -- thank god (and hopefully) it isn't.<br />
<br />
You have your niche, we have ours. Let's leave it at that. It's very rare that a Warrior can out perform a Knight in a one group encounter. Infact, it was unheard of, until now. . .</div></div><hr />

<br />
If Ikkinz trials are something you have to do once per guild it's fine the way they are.  But if they are something everyone has to do I really think they could be a bit more flexible.  As it stands 4 of your party member is already locked in warrior/cleric/healer #2/puller leaving only room for 2 'others'.  Even if gear somehow makes a Knight substitutable for a Warrior this doesn't solve the fact that there are still only 2 'other' slots available.  This makes the trials needlessly long.  Of course then you'd have to be vastly nerf the loot drop in the Ikkinz trials if they made them easier.  <br />

I don't mind their current difficulty, but I really don't want to be doing 3 trials per 2 'others' (which may or may not include Knights) over and over either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u78"><b>Throag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p78">If I remember well, there was indeed another mitigation table for us, but it was a long time ago, and knight got moved to the mitigation table as warriors. Once again this might be wrong as it was a very long time ago (and I might be confusing with the dmg tables).<br />
Anyway, I'm pretty sure knights and warriors have shared the same mitigation table for a long long time. Just have to look at some parses of time gods to see knights getting same (or even less from time to time) average dps than warrios (being BoV'ed equally and all....).<br />
That's why they gave us this DI bonus that makes cry all the knights.<br />

PoJ is NOT the same as those ikkinz trials.<br />
<br />
We had absolutely ZERO problem flagging the whole guild on PoJ trial apart from the fact that we had to wait for our turn because there was so many people trying them at the time. We even had some groupe getting flagged on other tials than Execution.<br />
<br />
And this was with only 2 full cleaning of VT mind you, our equipement was far from being &quot;ubber&quot;.<br />
<br />
Ikkinz != PoJ end of story.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u81"><b>Kildace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p81">I started this thread agreeing with Phantron, but upon reading it, I now agree with .. the rest of the warrior community.<br />
<br />
These trials are raids, to tank a raid mob, you need a warrior first, and then upon gearing up, a knight is able to tank the mobs. This is not new, this has always been the case (well no, a while ago knights couldn't tank anything, it's not the case anymore and I'm happy it isn't). Right now warriors are nearly the only class that can tank these mobs. In 3 weeks we'll see more and more knights tanking these (with more healing power needed than when a warrior tanks, but I fail to see how this is a problem), in 2 months, warriors won't be able to get trial groups.<br />
<br />
It was the same in the beggining of LDoN, it was the same in Time, it will be the same in Ikkinz. Changing these trials, or changing knights so they can tank these mobs would gimp either the trials, or warriors even more. Right now knights fill in filler roles (except in trial 2 actually), soon they'll be tanks, or paladins will be able to act as back healers (actually I won the first Pixxt with a cleric and pal as a back healer, I'm sure it's very doable to tank every mob there except DD with this set up). Right now, knights are pumped up because their newly acquired main tank on verything that is single group role (that they got upon raiding elementals and time thanks to the broken knightemisation) is no longer current and that they're back in the support class role they've always had prior to the past few months. In my opinion, we are back to the roots of the game, where a hybrid might be better than their parent class in some situations, but when it comes to the core skill of the parent class, they can't compete without outside help (here, one additional healer).<br />
<br />
In closing, I'd like to quote this :<br />
<br />
Not happening. Knights are still more useful and better tanks in the vast majority of one group content.<br />
<br />
Just because knights have troubles tanking three mobs in one group content doesn't mean they are suddenly inadequate.<br />
<br />
Sounds like a state of balance, doesn't it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u82"><b>Cily</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p82">I havent seen a good solution yet, did I miss any?<br />
<br />
Only half decent one is doing the mana/end drain thing, but thats pretty cheap.<br />
<br />
Also, the only thing this does is makes it so you HAVE to have a cleric. But then again, most knights ATM wouldn't care if clerics would be required, afterall who gives 2 shits about druids feelings when your own are at risk.<br />
<br />
So now we remove disc's and spells, and then we tune the MOB to druid healing DPS and where are we at? Gimp city. Even my guild of pre-Ssra folk will beat this crap.<br />
<br />
Or is it OK to require 2 druids then in this case? If so, can these mobs be killed if 2 knights work together?<br />
<br />
I suppose the other solution would be to improve knights tanking. If that happens, welcome to warrior rebalance version 2.0. Might as well gives us another 30% DPS and pretty much assume we never tank again.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u83"><b>Kildace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p83">I havent seen a good solution yet, did I miss any?<br />
<br />
For there to be a solution, there needs to be a problem.<br />
Knights only being able to tank these trials if their group provides a large healing power, and if they are very well geared is not a problem in my opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u84"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p84">Throag, you missed my point, that being that PoJ trials then required a good balanced group, and GoD trials now require a balanced group.<br />
<br />
The fact that these trials are designed for a completely different level of play has been established many, many pages ago, and should go without saying.<br />
<br />
Remember, for the first month or so of PoP, with even trials that are as easy now as the PoJ trials are... the only people that were getting past the trials were the people that had progressed into the top content of previous expansions.<br />
<br />
I still think it's far too early to start freaking out about perceived imbalances yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u85"><b>Throag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p85">No I didnt miss your point. What I meant was that PoJ trials did not require such &quot;balanced&quot; groups, the very fact that we had almost no troubles getting the whole guild flagged with not uber equipement is a proof. We were able to complete the Exe trial with almost any group with tank / healer and any others classes to complete the group as long as people were not playing like morons.<br />
This is not the case with the ikkinz trial. That's why I say you can't compare them about the necessity to bring &quot;balanced&quot; groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u86"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p86">When I first did trials, it took me 10-15 tries at level 60-61, and I didn't have uber equipment. In the end it took me an extremely balanced group to pass. So suffice to say, I have a QUITE different recollection from you.<br />
<br />
Noticing your statement that you cleared VT a couple of times, your experiences dovetail perfectly with my statement that the people that passed the trials easily were the ones that progressed to the top end content of the previous expansions... Much like only those who have progressed through the top end content of PoP have been able to pass trials so far.</div></div><hr />

Ikkinz != PoJ end of story.  <br />
<br />
Absolutely true.  PoJ trials were trivial on the day of PoP release for anyone with even average raid gear.  My guild had never been to Vex Thal when Luclin came out and my group beat execution on the first try with me tanking at level 61 and 30ish AA.  I seem to remember a guild group beating it with 2 paladins, a warrior, and an SK plus a druid who died as soon as the boss spawned. <br />
<br />
Anyway the point is the PoJ trials cannot be compared to Ikkinz.  The only people who had trouble with the PoJ trials were bazaar equipped newbies that weren't level 65, or even level 60 in most cases.  Ikkinz is clearly designed to only be winnable with a stacked group and the best gear available from the previous expansions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u90"><b>FulorianC</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p90">Ditto for Trial of Flame. I still don't agree you can compare the two, because there was 5 levels to gain, AA got so much easier to gain, and of course there was the fact that it was totally unrequired for anything except a mob thats died perhaps once per server, because nobody cares.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u91"><b>wraq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p91">We had to do a little gearing for the PoJ Trials but mostly it was just getting over 60. It makes sense that this one is more gear dependant due to no increased levels to aquire.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u92"><b>Zolanoid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p92">Wow, long thread. :) Best comment that I saw to sum this all up was from ZabooKnights are the preferred single-group tank for 99% of all known content. Along comes 1% that warriors are better equipped to handle and they don't want to give up even that 1% to anyone.Comparing myself to a paladin with similar gear, for example, I have defensive/stonewall and furious (my slight edge in HP/AC is often mostly/all mitigated by his self buff and ability to use a shield and still out-aggro me, so I won't mention it). Meanwhile he has a bunch of nice self and group heals, lots of stuns that by-the-way give him fast and unshakable aggro lock that allows him to tank much better than me, not to mention rez, roots, stackable group and self buffs, mad cures, the occasional LoH, and a bard speed horse.<br />
<br />
So now there are 3 trials that a guild must pass in single groups that contain a small handful of mobs for which defen/sw is actually a big advantage. So now there is supposed to be a problem because the Paladin who is used to his class being so powerful that it almost trivializes most of EQ feels bad that he's not the undeniable tanking god who laughs at the pitiful warrior in every conceivable single group situation? Hell that paladin is still damn great to have in that group through the majority of the trial since his tanking and utility superiority still handily outshines the warrior.<br />
<br />
Is there really a need to remove the warrior advantage on this small handful of encounters? I don't see it. Then you also have to remove the cleric advantage. If these were intended for pickup groups to blow through then I might see the point for balancing the trial named for knight tanks a little, since I know how shitty it was during PoP when warriors had to sit LFG (well mostly my more poorly-equipped warrior brothers) because many dipwit groups would rather wait for a knight to show up LFG than &quot;get stuck with some warrior who can't aggro anything.&quot; But if that is the attitude of your guildmates who won't work with you to find other ways to make great use of your tremendously useful class to get you flagged, then perhaps you need to try to change your guildmate's attitudes, not try to change these few mobs in these few trials that actually manage to add a strand of Balance to EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u93"><b>Celestias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p93">First trials 1-6 you can get by with a knight tanking, if they are time / high elemental equipped.  Next 7-9 trials if you dont have a warrior, your DEAD.  Having a warrior in trials 1-6 just makes it easier, but you can have a knight and get by possibly, the last mob in 6th can tear a knight apart unless they are very formidably equipped and healers are on track the whole time.  Thats all basically.<br />
<br />
These trials take time gear for the most part, some elementally geared people with the right gear can get by the first 6 but so far on tunare only time guilds are in Kod'taz, I believe it CAN be done though at a much slower rate with elemental equipment.  This is a expansion for higher tier and geared people, dont expect it to be like LDoN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u94"><b>seveirn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p94">not only PoJ trails, but you could use time trials at the same time, The only trial they do there &quot;DPS&quot; in  is in undead, Besides that,  There add tanking every single trial and or tanking the named from start to finish (had this happen alot.. Hell even a druid tanked Water named for a kick ;p (ya he lived wtf.)<br />
<br />
I think max hit outa all trials is 1300? and they barely hit there max, Knights dont exactly get torn apart but they sure have a harder time, Seem's more practical also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u95"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p95">Valid Points:   <br />
<br />
From the Warrior perspective:<br />
<br />
- These are not necessarily experience group content, nor are they likely to be repeated as such ever.<br />
<br />
- It is relatively early in the expansion, and much has yet to be learned.<br />
<br />
- Some of the trials don't even really need to be done, but were placed as an alternative to raid flagging, to prevent guildwide backflagging fiascos that plagued Planes of Power.   Thus it's difficult to justify not needing a &quot;specially tailored&quot; group for content which is designed to mimic the risk inherent in raid level targets.<br />
<br />
- Knights have tanked some of them, disproving the notion that they &quot;can't&quot;.<br />
<br />
From the Knight Perspective:<br />
<br />
- It is single group content, and a discipline shouldn't place such a large gap between two classes that are ordinarily on more or less equal footing at all other times.<br />
<br />
- It makes them feel inferior, and no one likes that<br />
<br />
- The mobs are immune to stun, disabling Paladins' only commonly used method of damage mitigation.<br />
<br />
- Knights don't have a short term auto-protection disc that gives short term survivablity as Warriors, beastlords, rangers, rogues, monks, and bards do, plus mage, necro, beastlord and shaman pets.  In the past, the dramatic gap in aggro justified this, as you would literally WANT a knight tanking after having built up loads of aggro and using said disc, but since the aggro gap has closed so significantly, an auto-parry or auto-riposte disc is justified.   The two other tank classes (those who you WANT to have mobs beating upon them) only have short term survivability that is *anti* tanking, or in other words specifically designed to disengage aggro.    In these trials, they feel that this would be particularly helpful, and that there no longer exists a justification for there not being one that not only every other melee class has, but every pet has as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
All the rest is worthless garbage.  The fact that Paladins can root in Lower Guk or Heal for 1khp isnt' really relevant to this issue, the fact that an SK can do other stuff is largely irrelevant to this issue as well.<br />
<br />
Both sides make valid points, it's unfortunate that neither is willing to admit that the other makes a valid point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u96"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p96">The named are not immune to stun.  However being level 68 that does make them immune to everything except Divine Stun.<br />
<br />
It seems kind of odd to me you'd gear up for those trials via the gear obtained from the raids that require passing the trials (since only one person needs to pass the trials to get the raids).  But if that's how you're supposed to gear up for those trials then I guess that's the way it is.<br />
<br />
It's unknown if everyone needs Ikkinz trials at this point.  If it's a once per guild thing yes there wouldn't be a problem.  But assuming everyone needs these, even if later Knights can tank them no problem that just moves the Knight from the 'other' to the tank spot and it still doesn't solve the fact that you need to run 3 trials to flag 2 'other' slots is really boring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u97"><b>seveirn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p97">Well you got Stuns and 1k Heals, But no one ever said it was a horrible thing,  i could think of countless time's say a paladins Crit 1200 heal has saved my ass, Or there stuns have Saved raid / Grps ass from gaters,  Ah but then you got them bitching about warrior's and There ability to deviate the damage incoming to them.  alas again it is irrelevent.<br />
<br />
While i'am Kinda moot about the whole knight tanking Issue,  I do think that they should not get any type of Disc / Spell that will in Allow them to tank To the Extent that a Warrior Is possible of doing.<br />
<br />
While on the subject on short term auto protection, i would say in some rare cases they DO have short term protection,  In the way of stuns.  a 2 Second or 3 second stun can mean alot of DPS (mob wise) to tankee, chance's of finding a mob stunnable in a raid / Grp situation now a day's is incredibly rare however.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anouther issue: From what i've seen of GoD, Some adverage trash mobs hit upwards of 1200 DMG, Now i love new content &amp; new encounter's ,  however.  What can this do for the little guy? sure hes max level, Hes got all his spells, Hes fully geared, But is he Elemental / time geared? ... no.  On that point theres not much to do, a 8800 HP Elemental / time knight Vs a 6400 Casual Guilded knight is a little Extreme, and conforms the expansion to the people who raid / Grp every day for there hard earned gear, This obviously goes for warriors Also,  Where's the content for the &quot;little guy&quot; ?.<br />
<br />
<br />
Warrior advantage: Way i see it, it was removed in a SLIGHT way, Take the Cragbeast Queen for example, this is a monster that is immune (almost) to every Type of Attack but pierceing, and as Far as  i know it, there is no weapon with Enrageing blow, taunting blow on a pierceing weapon (cept that 2hp, but that pos blows.) , It require's you to Farm a Ldon adventure for an anger aug, OR  , Ta Da, You got it, Have a knight tank.<br />
<br />
<br />
All for now.</div></div><hr />

The bosses are, the trash is not. When trash is doing 1400 dps hasted, you'll pray that Paladin is popping a stun/dispel here and there, especially on incoming. This is the way an encounter should be designed in Everquest. It takes the wits of the group to defeat, every member has an integral role.<br />

Indeed they do, Paladins have Lay on Hands, Divine Aura, and a bevy of heals. These are forms of 'short term' AND 'long term' damage mitigation. Shadowknights have Harmshield and Feign Death as well as some large lifetap 'disciplines' as well as regular lifetaps. These are also forms of 'short term' damage mitigation. Damage mitigation in Everquest is not solely relegated to /disc defensive.</div></div><hr />

It's all nice and good that your Knight is playing a good utility role etc, but at least on my guild EQ doesn't work that way.  People will want a DPS person for the last two 'other' slots.  Whether this is ignorance or not, I do not know, but I can't tell people how to play EQ.  Funny you should mention dispel because in every Kod'taz+ group I have been it was always the pure melee (monk or me) that's telling the group mobs need to be dispelled.  So I don't exactly have much faith in the utility of others.  I mean on LDoN I am usually the one stunning the gater with kick as opposed to the 6 different classes that have a stun.  Perhaps this is a symptom of people never having to do anything beyond the most rudimentary roles for a long time (DPS, tank, heal, pull, CC, etc) but rather than counting on people will suddenly know how to use the rest of their spellbook I'd rather just take 2 DPS instead for the highest chance of winning.<br />
<br />
A Knight might be able to tank but the first time the Knights dies (and it will happen) people will be saying 'we need a Warrior for this'.  You mentioned on your board how you got owned by DD and then finally beat it.  My group did that too but that's not how rest of EQ works.  When people get owned by a trial they'll start complaining how Knights aren't balanced and tell Warrior_01 to get over there to babysit them through the encounter.  I already get too many tells to tank for Tipt which people think is not Knight tankable and I really don't want to think what will happen when people actually start working on Ikkinz.  <br />
<br />
It's cool the first or the second time to be the warrior that comes in to save the day but I certainly don't want to be participating in 1/4th of all the trials my guild does (we have 4 warriors geared on the high end).  I don't have a good solution to this, but I think expecting a warrior present in every trial is wrong if everyone needs them at some point.<br />

The only thing that's not stunnable in the Ikkinz trials are the actual bosses (DD/Malevolent Priests/Flesh Hunters) from what our monk with SoT said.</div></div><hr />

Shadowknights have Harmshield and Feign Death as well as some large lifetap 'disciplines' as well as regular lifetaps. These are also forms of 'short term' damage mitigation. Damage mitigation in Everquest is not solely relegated to /disc defensive.  <br />
<br />
Ok can you explain to me what other &quot;large lifetap disciplines&quot; I have other then Leechcurse?  Oh yeah 24 seconds of lifetapping through melee is nice..when I actually hit the mob.  I tried using it to help save my ass in a hard LDoN the other day and guess what?  <br />
<br />
LOADING PLEASE WAIT.....<br />
<br />
ToInny is nice though when you add SCF3, ToL3, and a ID4 item to the mix, but even then most of my normal hits w/ it max at 568.  Add in the SCF and ToL (when they do work) and yeah I got a nice self heal for 2k max (has happened only 2 times in 5 months), but if the mob is hitting you for as much as you all say and figuring in the recast time I aint lasting long if things dont go perfect.<br />
<br />
Yeah my guild is in ele planes, but the odds of myself seeing these trials is slim to none.  My gear will never be good enough and even if it was I sure as hell dont want to take the chance that one mistimed heal is going to casue a CR for my freinds/guildies.</div></div><hr />

The thing is, your issue with trials isn't a class based one, but an advancement based one, and I'm fairly certain that every single one of us agrees that it's a good thing.   People want their time spent in time and getting there to have some value after the fact.<br />
<br />
Incidentally, I have a lot less concern for SK's in these trials, as the relatively low HP of the bosses is such that it indeed is a form of damage avoidance to do a rather substantial chunk of damage in one fell swoop.  In other words, because of the nature of these, a SK's skills have a significant amount of value, and therefore I don't have an issue with you not being able to tank.   I do on the other hand have an issue with what a Paladin brings.</div></div><hr />

True but the biggest thing I see is to many people grouping ALL knights into the same catagorey even though they are 2 seperate classes w/ much differing abilibties and spell sets.  <br />
<br />
While some knights will be able to tank these trails, even if the margian for error is 0, it also only applies to about 10% (if not much less then) of the knight population through all the servers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At this stage less than 10% of guilds across all servers are probably at this stage of advancement.  Probably less than 10% of knights can tank Quarm too, but I don't see the same amount of fuss being made about that.</div></div><hr />

Lets call a spade a spade...<br />
<br />
These trials need to be tuned without defensive in mind, OR some adjustment made to knight raid-level tanking.  The &quot;just wait&quot; crowd is the same as those that thought warrior &quot;taunt&quot; in PoP was just about equipment... and thought that the disadvantage would go away after warriors were properly equipped...  I guess its only fun while you have the advantage eh?<br />
<br />
I also STILL concur that knights should not get defensive as we know it... nor even evasive...<br />
<br />
<br />
A simple spell/aa/discipline that allows a knight to tank a raid-level mob DIFFERENTLY may be the best solution.<br />
<br />
The two knights could be tuned with such an ability that integrates their melee and their spellcasting into auto-mode.<br />
<br />
Perhaps a shadowknight absorbs part of the blow into mana and reflects some of it back. (effect of a lifetap if you look at it in the terms of tanking, thus this is only really setting a shadowknight to auto-lifetap mode...)  This burns through a shadowknights mana fast, and leaves them lesser than a warrior eventually...  but should be spectacular for the time it lasts.<br />
<br />
Numbers could of course be adjusted to be fair and balanced. <br />
<br />
<br />
This could be a spell, an ability, an AAXP, or a discipline...<br />
<br />
The whole idea would be to make tanking different for the three classes....<br />

<br />
So converting Mana into some kind of super reverse DS?  Intresting idea but the odds of it being fair and balanced are pretty slim.  You could have it set to use so much mana per tic, but then you get into how FT/C3/SD and other mana regen spells will effect it.  <br />
<br />
Also some SK races will have a higher mana pool then others (mostly dependant on gear) so it will last longer for some then for others.  If it wasnt tuned to be just perfect then you could end up seeing groups w/ a SK, healer, slower, 2 necro's, and then random class w/ the necro's pumping the SK w/ mana so he tanks Mob02 even longer.</div></div><hr />

^Idiotic banter aside, I'll take option 3 - do nothing and let inflation set in over time. Tuning Knight tankability to higher/greater levels than it is now? Laughable... Hilarious... a joke. <br />

Basically you are saying you don't want defensive, but an entirely new ability that equals it? If it were on a two hour timer or something I would maybe agree, but giving knights anything like defensive with a short reuse timer like defensive would make the need for a warrior in any group negligible.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u120"><b>arbosch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p120">Well you are funny furor.<br />
<br />
I can find a role for every class which is different from the others. The problem is there are only 6 spots. At the moment you have this.<br />
<br />
1. Tankslot (Warrior only, knights can tank this mobs, but it is not save. A warrior make the tanking trival and so everyone will take  a warrior. Dont tell me that you take a knight if you have a warrior and sooner or later noone will go in with knights because we all hate to waste time and to go there with a knight is wasting time because you can loose even when you play perfect).<br />
2. Mainhealing (Cleric)<br />
3. Debuffing (Enchanter or Shaman)<br />
4. Assisthealer (it is an open spot for Druids/Shamans/Paladins)<br />
5.+6. Dps (More or less all class but higher dps class are more welcome)<br />
<br />
The mainproblem is, that you have more then 6 classes and 2 spots are fix for warrior and cleric and you need to get the one which need the flag in to. Sooner or later you will have the 4 mainspots and 2 which need the flag. Everyone which call this bullshit balanced is an idiot. The question is, if this is okay or not. I dont think it is that a bad thing that only warrior can tank them, but then stop with the bullshit that it is balanced. 2 classes have a 100% chance to get in. 4 classes have a 50% chance to get in and the other classes have a less then 20% chance to get in. Balance will mean every class has the same % to get in and this isnt the case here so stop talking from balance. It is not and will never be. But this isnt the problem.<br />
<br />
So dont be an idiot furor and agree with it that it isnt balanced but because EQ has that a fucked up groupe/class system they will ether make this hard for a fucked up classcombo or make it trival for a mainclass combo.<br />
<br />
The only way to create balance is to give every class a special role which stack with the other classes and make that the groupe has exactly a slot for every classe. Then you can balance encounters and balance will be no problem because noone step on others feet. But everquest dont have this so knights need to step on warriors feet and need to be able to get in the tankslot to. <br />
<br />
It is a bad sign for balance that 2 classes are needed for a 6 groupe flag encounter and the other classes have to fight for the last 4 spots. This is and will never be balanced.<br />

ITs not as much I dont find a use in trials, , I can make myself useful enough that i'm not dead weight, (well at least as far as i've progressed) my spot maybe could be better be filled with another class usually, but hey i can deal with that however most guilds just do not have enough warriors to have to support many groups, haviing people sit on sidelines is stupid. (Yes healer situation is dumb also but at least healing has been f'd up for so long most guilds have a lot of them)<br />
<br />
Balance Them against a warrior with evasive/Fortitude, then all 3 tnak class's can tank them with suffecient gear, warriors retain a visable advantage on tanking (Fort/evasive + Natural Bonus) however the disparity is not as large as it is.</div></div><hr />

The classes are supposed to be different and balanced. Not equal, yah? So knights have a disadvantage in these trials... You have advantages in other situations. Against undead, against mobs that proc slow or some other shit or have funny agro. Those mobs are completely untankable by warriors in most cases. In 6 man group anyone whining that they dont bring enough to the table... Well it all depends how good of the player you are. If all you can do is play warrior when you are able to cast spells... Who the fuck will want to group with you. If you can adjust, knights do bring a lot to the table. Its called utility and if I understand correctly its one of the main reason you chose your class.<br />
<br />
Maybe you think that ranjars not able to tank these mobs is not right and every class should be made the same and be able to solo through these trials? This is EQ. This is game that emphasises teamwork... Learn to work together and thats all there is to it and for god sakes learn to use your utilities.</div></div><hr />

Not many guilds are talking about it much, but take a look at Arch Overseers (http://www.archoverseers.org/) site, their 2/18/04 update will give you an idea of what Ikkinz loot looks like.

Tuning these trials down would be a colossal mistake.

I hope these trials are one key PER PERSON to advance, So many people here are being hypocrits, We want equality blah blah. CRY ME A RIVER.<br />
<br />
Am I the only one that can see how nice it would be, For these trials to be warrior only tankable and that everyone needed a key to advance?<br />
<br />
The reason why you ask? Because a lot more of us would no longer be LFG for hours on end, yes im that petty that I would inflict this trial onto any knight, and watch them get pissed off because they arent the G.o.D tank they think they where. <br />
<br />
Oh yes friends, I'd be dancing for joy if these trials required defensive on the boss so that we could be the only class able to tank it. <br />
<br />
&quot;But Kadah your being one sided, your being a warrior Nazi, Blah blah blah&quot; Really? No shit, I am. A lot of us have spent hours back in our PoP time looking for groups while knights with on demand aggro  took almost every slot there was for the average to even starting elemental spot.<br />
(yes Knights you cant cry kunark. Im crying PoP get a god damn new expansion to wave around like a flag on the field) <br />
<br />
Now maybe that they are begining to learn that they cant run around exploiting stuns, fear's etc for aggro those ego's may die down abit and they may /gasp Have to learn what other spells are in their spellbooks.. OH MY GOD. WHAT A CONCEPT. YOU MEAN EVERY SPELL OTHER THEN STUN HAS A PURPOSE?!?!<br />
<br />
Yes im being sarcastic, But its 4:30 in the morning. The point of the matter is.  Warriors who preach that current content should be equaled out, And yet preached for more aggro abilities are hypocritical bastards. There is now solid content to help alleviate warriors that are LFG if only at the high current END GAME. <br />
<br />
And people want to balance it.. Puff, Puff, Pass sir. I need some of what your smoking to make me think, That it has already come 360 and we now need to rebalance because the poor widdel knightywites cant tank.. Awww... poor dem.. Let me cry dem a river.. (see now this is sarcasm) <br />
<br />
Get over it. Shut the fuck up, And enjoy what we have before knights get past the content gear up with whatever insane mudflation items G.o.D offers and let them come back and tank the shit in 7 to nine months. <br />

also dont know about you but having to do even the easy trials  1-6 , over and over becuase well equiped knights just cant tank this stuff is stupid and boring. i agree it shouldnt be easy to gain access to these new zones but when a decent equip time sk cant tank named in even the lower trials you know something is wrong.<br />
<br />
<br />
dont think giving them defense the anwser but the extra 2%mitigation and 500hp and maybe a  good self rune  is not to much to ask for espical when they are a tank class that cant tank.  Simply amazing. Apparently you missed the 25 pages of discussion that preceeded your visionary comments. Grats on your future Darwin award.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u144"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p144">Since we seem to have some people who are missing the finer points of the 26 page discussion let me summarize:<br />
<br />
1. Trial 1-4 - You can skip these alltogether with a raid. No debate here. If you choose to do them with a single group, they are easier than an LDoN hard. Everyone needs these to progress.<br />
<br />
2. Trial 5-6 - The trash hits pretty hard but is slowable stunnable. The bosses are a little harder but usually at least partially slowable. Full EP knights, early EP/full VT warriors can tank these. These are not that hard, they lead the way to Kod'Taz. These have to be done by everyone.<br />
<br />
3. Kod'Taz trials - These trials are hard as hell. Full Time knights or early Time warrior required but will have a fairly high fail rate. Prefered tank is full Time warrior and even then it is hard. Only 1 person in the entire guild needs to complete all trials to raid Ikkinz - this is 100% true and verified by multiple guilds. It is unknown at this time if everyone will need the flags to progress or not.<br />
<br />
4. Ikkinz raids - The loot that drops in the Ikkinz raids starts off as tier 3+ Time loot with the best drops being Quarm+ quality. Raids are instanced so they can be farmed once you beat them. The loot from this tier in combination with Time loot will give knights a much higher success rate in the Kod'Taz trials.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u145"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p145">Ikkinz raids appear to be too easy at the moment.  I honestly don't see how any guild that can beat the trials would fail to these at the moment, at least based on the Chamber of Transcendence.  We failed Chamber of Transcendence but it's not related to the difficulty at all.  In light of this yes the trials have to be hard seeing Guardian of Transcendence drops Quarm loot and is barely harder than a Pixtt Annihlator.  Though the better question to ask is why is Guardian of Transcendence barely harder than a Pixtt Annihlator...</div></div><hr />

The reason why you ask? Because a lot more of us would no longer be LFG for hours on end<br />
My friend, you would still be LFG.  It would mean that the high elemental / time geared tanks would be in higher demand for trial groups, but they generally arent the crowd who complains about having trouble getting groups anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
what a surprise... Furor wants warriors to be five times better than knight in everything...  no one would expect that!  <br />
However, in wishing to keep this out of the outhouse, I digress...<br />
<br />
<br />
The funny thing is...  warriors are now quite powerful in XP groups. (and rightly so) but warriors still think that knights should require 10+ &quot;biggest-baddest-mob-in-the-game&quot; loots to be able to stand up to something a 6-man group is supposed to take on.<br />
<br />
it shouldn't take &quot;knightemization&quot; to allow knights to tank...<br />
Just like the warriors who complained about aggro, knights have just as much right to mention the blatant difference between a warrior tanking a raid mob and a knight tanking it....  especially before BOTH warrior and knight advance beyond that encounter.<br />
<br />
One of my warrior guildies just logged on for the first time since we killed quarm for the first time.  He has ZERO time loot.  most of our knights wear multiple slots worth of time loot and LDoN augments...<br />
<br />
This warrior in elemental and no augments has an easier time tanking than most of our time loot and augmented knights...<br />
<br />
Now... &quot;easier&quot; isn't what bothers me...  its that the knights in all that gear and all that time invested are not even in the same league as that warrior in just elemental armor.<br />
<br />
boy, that &quot;knightemization&quot; sure helped alot!<br />
<br />
That is quite simply neither fun nor anywhere close to fair.<br />
I thought warriors would understand that quite well after the whole aggro thing.<br />
<br />
<br />
Warriors should be BETTER tanks...  but not so much better that the knight can barely compete even with the best gear in the game against a warrior who has been absent for a whole expansion and then some.<br />
<br />
The culprit isn't the melee balancing... it isn't even the absolutle abysmally bad knight GoD spells and AA's.<br />
<br />
Its just one thing...  disciplines that were created back in Kunark.<br />
Ah Kunark, the days of logging out your knight and playing someone else's warrior so you as a player could be worth the lag you created...<br />
<br />
Warriors were balanced against other classes based on defensive...  and it was wrong.  Now warriors are not balanced to other classes considering defensive, and the mobs are still based upon defensive, and the other tank classes don't have as much as an auto-parry discipline like every other melee class!<br />
<br />
<br />
Warriors should be better at absorbing damage...  this is their job.<br />
<br />
However, knights should be acceptable tanks period...  yes even for raids.  This is also their job.  We all know how fun it is to not be able to do what your class was designed for... (knights from kunark up until PoP, warriors more recently)<br />
<br />
Anything that allows knights to stand in the face of these &quot;tuned-for-defensive&quot; mobs for a few more seconds is more than justified...<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;If the wait and see&quot; crowd get their way, they will have not only the raid tanking market cornered, but the XP group and get their cake and eat it too...  just wait until warriors are filling their spellbooks with half the spells of a hybrid on top of all they have now...<br />
<br />
no amount of &quot;knightemization&quot; will help when the warriors get half our spellbook (and likely better to boot)<br />
<br />
GoD will turn out to be worse than Kunark...<br />
<br />
<br />
Balance has this funny way of hitting you in the backside when you least expect it.  Knights are back to Kunark and are being threatened with worse...  It cannot last.  Especiallly when so many good alternatives to EQ are just on the horizon.<br />
<br />
Expect to see more in the &quot;melee balancing part II&quot; than you expected.<br />

<br />
Are you willing to either lose your ability to cast in its entirety, or give warriors the nearly the same kind of additional abilities in spell like effects, just for the use of defensive? I say nearly, because defensive isn't quite all the picture, but it's by far the most important of it.<br />

<br />
Care to specify what they have an easier time tanking?  I'm in a EP guild and the comparably equiped knights in my own guild are all but on par with me for tanking anything but raid named and GoD named.<br />
<br />
<br />
Warriors should be BETTER tanks... but not so much better that the knight can barely compete even with the best gear in the game against a warrior who has been absent for a whole expansion and then some.<br />
<br />
So uh, unless I missed something, PoTime wasn't an expansion in and of itself.  All the tiers below it were also a part of PoP, and according to your own post your warrior guildy was EP equipped.<br />

<br />
No and no, this is just flat out godclass wannabe talking.  Warriors have always been required for tanking new/cuttingedge content for a guild.  Its our piece of the pie for playing a class that brings no utility to the table other than being the BEST at taking damage.  My guild is EP+FR/Xeg, already our top couple of pallies could tank over half our EP raid content using the same Cheal Rotation our top warriors use.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;If the wait and see&quot; crowd get their way, they will have not only the raid tanking market cornered, but the XP group and get their cake and eat it too... just wait until warriors are filling their spellbooks with half the spells of a hybrid on top of all they have now...<br />

<br />
Last I checked, I don't have a spellbook.  I have this little box with a skill to help fix my dependence on the RNG for procs, and a set of disciplines on long enough timers that I generally only pop them for named mobs or bad situations, otherwise they might be down when I REALLY need them.  The day they give warriors even one root, snare, group heal, FD, targetable heal, hp buff, LoH, or HT you have an point of contention.  Until then this is just wild, unfounded speculation used to bolster an already weak argument.<br />
<br />
<br />
Knights are back to Kunark and are being threatened with worse... It cannot last.<br />
<br />
As far as I know knights are still tanking all manner of xp groups, LDoN groups, and even GoD up to a point.  Warriors have a firm grasp on a very small portion of the high end one group content and you're already crying &quot;Kunark&quot;, you'll be getting no sympathy or respect from me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u150"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p150">Knights are back to Kunark and are being threatened with worse... It cannot last.<br />
How are knights now being threatened with Kunark?<br />
<br />
In Kunark knights sucked the big one, they tanked shit, they did shit DPS and they had a limited selection of crap spells which they had fuck all mana to cast with and casting them made their crap DPS worse.<br />
<br />
In Luclin Knights became acceptable XP group tanks.  In PoP Knights became the prefered XP group tank.  How the fuck is some high end 6 person progression trial going to blast knights back to worse than Kunark. <br />
<br />
Knights are still a strong XP group tank, its not like GoD came along and suddenly knights cant tank in PoE anymore and the concensus I have seen is that PoP is still a better place to grind AAs / XP.<br />
<br />
My guild is still just testing the waters with GoD so I can't speak for how other guilds are handling Ikkinz, but you can be sure that our Pallys and SKs have been tanking in GoD groups since the day it came out.<br />
<br />
This was Kunark:<br />
Cleric_01 tells the guild &quot;Group looking for tank&quot;<br />
Paladin_01 tells the guild &quot;I'm LFG!&quot;<br />
Cleric_01 tells the guild &quot;I said we are looking for a TANK&quot;<br />
<br />
How the fuck are knights back to this and being threatened with worse?  There are a couple of guild progression trials which need* a warrior and suddenly your class is shit??<br />

<br />
No sir, I would say that the way to fix a paladin without nerfing warriors again  is to give them some variant of a stun proc/spell that allows them to keep the mob stunned so they avoid getting hit just enough to tank properly.  And it'd need to generate enough aggro so that a warrior wouldn't be able to outaggro it (and therefore get the benefit of the warrior tank with stuns.)<br />
<br />
If that makes sense... also make it so that two paladins can't chain stun the same mob. (Because if they could it would make it trivial.)</div></div><hr />

The more I discover, the weaker the Knights' position is.   <br />
<br />
First, the trials leading to Ikkinz aren't *required* to be done by any more than a single person.   In other words &quot;a trophy group&quot;.   If that means that my friend Flelemph or Thalzaar does it instead of me, does that make me less of a tank?  Doea that make me &quot;unimportant&quot;, because they did it and I didn't?   Nope.   <br />
<br />
The other issue is with Kod`Taz nameds in exp groups.  Well, I got news for you, single group nameds in BoT at first &quot;required a warrior tank&quot; too.  Well, they did to the same extent that Kod`Taz nameds do, in that you would need to reconfigure your group for Knights to tank.  The difference, you can MORE THAN HALF KILL THEM WITH A SINGLE HARMTOUCH.   You already have a HUGE advantage over Paladins who actually have to tank them for their entire life, you get the benefit of killing mobs that are over half dead.<br />
<br />
You also happen to stack REALLY REALLY REALLY well with warriors in these trials, a SK is among my TOP choices for trial groups precisely because of the EXTREME power of harmtouch against bosses.  The burst damage you put out against these mobs is un fucking believable, I'd argue it's damn near as powerful as defensive.</div></div><hr />

On a less vitiriolic note, if HT really does blow the trial bosses away, perhaps SK/Cleric/Druid/Wizard/Ench would be a viable combo with any non-mage DPser finshing out the group. Cheap and irritating, but if it can put the boss down in 10 seconds, eh.</div></div><hr />

One of the better groups I have been in was SK/Cleric/Druid/Wizard/Wizard/Ench. Trash mobs where trivial due to 3 of us liberally using 8 sec stuns, bosses dropped like rocks between HT+MB (around 18k damage on inc).

I really don't see what an extra MB + HT would get you on the other ones.  DD isn't going down to that and Flesh Hunters don't need that kind of DPS to kill.  If you're using that to kill the random named, Warrior can burn Furious which is almost as good as HT anyway.  The 12 second of riposte is huge DPS.</div></div><hr />

Therefore my entire group's DPS + riposte damage is the DPS of furious.  It is quite easy to get this to be over 800 even without adding the riposte damage.  <br />
<br />
Knights do not need, and frankly they don't deserve anything like Weaponshield unless it kills their mana.  Furious is one of the most damaging DPS discs in the game not because of the damage is does, but because the time you're invulrnable to melee gives everyone else extra time to attack they wouldn't have otherwise (assuming this is a tanking-based encounter, not AE/add/etc).  On a raid versus MT type bosses Furious is easily worth thousands of DPS.</div></div><hr />

BTW if Furious didn't work, DA most certainly would not either.  You realize that a Knight has no aggro and no way of getting aggro while DA?  I can't believe some of you are saying Knights need something like Furious.  It knocks off 10-20% off any boss for free, unless your group sucks so much they manage to kill themselves while you're using Furious, which is far more than what a HT or MB can do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u181"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p181">I'm guessing you calculated HT DPS at 800 from (9800/12 seconds)? If you want to play it that way, my Furious easily beats 800 DPS. Why? Because it gives 12 seconds extra seconds of damage time for the entire group that they didn't have otherwise. Therefore my entire group's DPS + riposte damage is the DPS of furious. It is quite easy to get this to be over 800 even without adding the riposte damage. <br />
<br />
I read something like that some time ago... the author's name was Bracy?<br />

Giving HT a dps number is pretty useless anyways imo. It's instant 9k +/- something instant. At most you could take the total fight length to give HT individual dps, but for most high burst damage abilities, DPS is not really meaningful.</div></div><hr />

If your clerics are dying on anything besides the named at all, they suck and shouldn't be doing these trials in the first place.I don't agree with this completely. While your cleric shouldn't be getting hit, shit does happen that are sometimes out of your control. A couple nights ago, the server kept having little hicups and booting people, we lost 3 people to LD multiple times in a 10 minute span. Due to the delay in waiting, the repops caught us just as we engaged the enraged mother. We still beat the biatch, but not before the cleric died to the add. Not much we could do, the bard mezzed the add as soon as we saw it, but it made a beeline for the cleric, even at 7.5khp clerics go down fast if they get blindsided. We had to scrap the trial and start over because we were too far to fight back in and no 2nd rezzer in the group. The value of a 2nd rez class in the trials is vastly underestimated. When you could flush 2+ hours of work down the toilet due to a single unfortunate death, a 2nd rez class brings trial saving utility to a group.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That makes it so wrong?  Thats how its supposed to be. <br />
<br />
You said it yourself, Knights can tank the same content, warrior just happen to have it easier for 3 minutes every 7 minutes 30 seconds. <br />
<br />
Knights have a spellbook that is not restricted by a timer like disciplines are,  and they posses a manapool favored by mana regeneration spells/items. <br />
<br />
I remember the same arguement about warriors and <br />
taunt in PoP... its the same thing. The differential is just too freaking large. <br />
<br />
And it remains freaking large still. The introduction of Incite, 400 hate every 30 seconds, is not in parity with knight aggro generation.    Knight aggro spell do NOT have a re-use time of 30 second and they sure as hell do more than 400 hate per cast. <br />
<br />
Knight obscene aggro generation is not even limited by a: 3 minute duration, 7 minute 30 second re-use timer AND endurance cost like Warrior defensive is.<br />
<br />
Dont forget the rest of the spellbook and abilities either. That is part of the Knight package as well.<br />
<br />
Whats else? You will compare Paladin Heals/buffs+mana pool to Cleric heal/buffs+mana pool so they are in parity there too? Because their differential is too fricking large too. <br />

Fine Brik, you want the same trick as the one-trick pony warrior?  Cool, you got it.  Same stats/timers as warriors have even, np.  But you're going to have to give up some advantages.  Like, say, spells.  No more heals, no more rezzes, no more buffs, no more mana/lifetaps, no more FD, snares, nada,  for self or group.  Your ONLY remaining spells will be spells that cause damage to mobs, either DoT's or DD, and will have much longer refresh times.  Your utility is no more, but as any trolling knight already knows, that utility never did anything for a knight anyways, right ?  As well, your mana pool will be severely gimped, plus the mana cost of spells will be largely increased, and as well, you will no longer be affected by FT items or spells.  Chain casting will be a thing of the past.  As well, the agro effects of low-level spells which cannot possible affect the mobs they are cast on will of course be adjusted.  This way, you will have to carefully consider which spells you want to use, and when you want to use them.  The AA horses will be removed from game, and will be re-introduced when war boars become available for warriors.  All/all gear is already the way the game is, so nothing needs to be changed there.<br />
<br />
Congrats.  You are now Warrior-Lite, with 10% better agro to compensate for our 10% better tanking.  As well, you still get the bonuses of LoH and HT, so consider yourselves ahead in the equation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u192"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p192">Right now the numbers look like 1000 DPS for warrior, disced versus 1300 DPS for Knights.  Now before you say that's only 10/13 which is about 77%, it's actually quite a bit more than that because your chance of surviving something that does double the DPS sure isn't 50% of the chance to survive something that does 1 X DPS.  I don't think there's anything wrong with this but don't act like Knights are really that close to us for these encounters.  We outperform them by quite a significant margin.</div></div><hr />

Let me translate in one word. IRONY. Seriously, the fucking irony is, 8 months ago, you were riding the &quot;holier-than-thou&quot; horse through Fairyland screaming &quot;You warriors whine too much, knights are balanced, look at Kunark, kekekke.&quot; How does the real balance bat feel? hurts don't it.....<br />
<br />
&quot;I remember the same arguement about warriors and taunt in PoP... its the same thing. The differential is just too freaking large.&quot;<br />
<br />
In PoP, YOU were preaching about how warrior agro was fine, and there should be no taunt upgrades unless knights get defensive. Don't try to bullshit your way out now, too late.<br />
<br />
&quot;A Non-defensive warrior tanks 12% better than an equally equipped knight....&quot;<br />
<br />
WRONG. Here's a parse if you want results. Look specifically at warrior vs. Pal/SK. Difference is 109.2 vs 131.2 and 130.4. But wait, the warrior has 15% shielding while the pal/SK have 0, which accunts for exactly 15dps in that, so add that to 109.2 = 124.2. Plus, the warrior has an 8% riposte mod. True, the SK has 10 avoidance, but the warrior has 210 ac more than the SK,and 200 more than the paladin. 130.4 - 124.2 = 6.2 DPS, which is 4.7% better than the paladin. 131.2 - 124.2 = 7 dps, which is 5.3% better than the Shadowknight. you know, if you ADD those two numbers, you STILL don;t get 12%. but seriously, how does that foot taste.... idiot.<br />
<br />
&quot;The game must change, for it has changed and what was ignored as a flaw is now a blatant flaw. It has always been wrong, its just that now its much more noticeable.<br />

I would like to quote this once more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u195"><b>landrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p195">The problem is very complex...<br />
<br />
Knights and Warriors CAN and DO tank every mob in the game prior to GoD.<br />
<br />
Warriors need lesser gear to do this effectively, ie an Elemental Warrior can tank Time mobs, but a Time Knight is needed for Time mobs...  <br />
<br />
On first attempts, Warriors are almost ALWAYS the tank of choice, why? Defensive. Really the extra 5-12% mitigation depending upon how you parse it, and extra 400-1000 hps, doesn't mean as much as Defensive..  but... and here is where things diverge some..<br />
<br />
You may say that in PoP, fights lasted longer than 3 minutes, and tank swaps were not the normal, only on tank death did people swap tanks. True that would be, and the reason is that the CHC's with multitudes of clerics/druids were running on normal 2 sec casts... the healing was all based on worste case scenario, and defensive was always a 'safety' factor.<br />
<br />
Now we have GoD, where 'Defensive' is again, from all indications, with even the best tanks, required, ala- old school AoW, Without defensive, you expect to die. There no longer is a 2 sec CHC going, and no longer is worste case healing the norm. Defensive is the key factor in getting over the hump so to speak in defeating these trials. <br />
<br />
Should the trials require a Defensive Time Geared Tank? On that I am not so sure. They open up the doors basically to  Phase 4 Plane of Time Part II so from all past experience a full elemental/early time warrior should be able to tank them. But also a full time knight should  also. <br />
<br />
If this is the case, and it certainly looks to be the case, then balance is not that far off. I do however see one problem, and that is that these trials drop decent loot that should be available for any class to be able to aquire. With the current limits on class alignment....<br />
<br />
Group composition -  Warrior (defensive), Cleric, Healer (cleric,Dru), DEBUFFER (slow/dispell),  Puller , DPS....(SOS rogue is almost always required also)<br />
<br />
This prevents Many classes not just Knights from access to this 'content'<br />
<br />
I would prefer instead of changing the encounter, or the class balance... perhaps increasing the expedition size to 8, 9  or 10, would be more than adequate...  9 I think would be almost Ideal.</div></div><hr />

This caught my attention tho, and I agree with it 100%I think the one group trials are the best method I have seen used in a long time to keep undergeared people out of the next zone. Even the gatekeepers (RZ) in PoP were fairly easy for 60 NToV early ssra geared people.

People seem to think that DPS has to be damage done by swinging a weapon.  That is wrong.  If you want to compare Warrior to Knight DPS, then the DPS of Furious is the combined DPS of your entire group + riposte damage because this is something that cannot be done by any Knight.  Or, to look at it another way, a mob can be down by one HT of damage before the fight even starts by HT.  But, if you Furious, it will be down by your group's DPS X 12 seconds + riposte damage X 12 seconds before the fight actually begins.  The latter will always win given enough DPS in your group.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u204"><b>Swobu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p204">That argument is so alike the argument the shammy made about shamans being the best DPS in EQ because they could &quot;Slow time&quot;, buff haste, buff avatar, buff strength, dot, nuke.<br />
<br />
His argument was, that if he didn't slow the mob, the cleric had to heal even more, meaning more downtime, meaning less xp/hour. (which is correct of course)<br />
He then argued, that the difference between killing mobs for one hour without slow, without haste and other DPS enhancing buffs and killing mobs for one hour with slow/haste/avatar/focus/dots/nukes/cleric nukes etc etc would be HIS DPS, since he made it possible for the melees to have more DPS, and since he slowed the mob, the cleric could nuke more and heal less.<br />
<br />
All though I understand the arguments, I personally don't think you can make that conclussion. <br />
If you do make that conclusion, you could argue that the best DPS class EVER, is a cleric. Without them, the warrior would die on the boss. If warrior dies, then wizards, rangers, rogues etc etc die also. So because the cleric keep the warrior alive, they make it possible for the rest of the DPS classes to do their full damage.</div></div><hr />

You could go all the way through PoP and have never killed Emp or broken into VT. It helped tremendously of course,but wasnt required.<br />
GoD however is done right in the fact that you need to not only have beaten Time once,but have effectivily cleared it multiple, multiple times.<br />
<br />
Personally I havent done much in GoD,a few sewer trials and a Tipt trial.So far I like the expansion a lot.<br />
My reasons<br />
#1. I FELT SCARED for a change.I havent felt scared in EQ for a looooong time and it felt good.<br />

Seriously,the hardest thing Ive encountered in GoD so far is the Tipt boss,hitting for around 2100 with defensive,unslowed.<br />
It looks like at least at the lower tiers the recipe for difficulty is hitting like a truck but having few HPs.<br />
<br />
How can they make these knight friendly?Give them (the mobs)more HP and lower the damage output.But that leaves one question.....WHY?<br />
As said before, get off of your freaking God Mode and back to reality.Knights are SECONDARY...let me repeat...SECONDARY...<br />

<br />
Why should you be able to tank everything I can?because you can wear plate?Dont think so.Clerics and bards where plate also,BFD.As said before, Knights can still tank 90%+ of current content,whats the whining about?This shouldnt even be a whine/arguement.<br />
You know what I am enjoying however?I actually *gasp* am needed/wanted for a group again based off my class,not having to group with people who know me/because there were no 65 knights LFG.Hasnt happened since before PoP really.<br />
<br />
Those are not exp grinds,those are mini raids,taking more skill than your avg big bad boss mob raid,where all you have to do is have a person with a mana pool and Cheal and enough intelligence to follow a rotation on time x6+.<br />
Its still a raid though.Its for flag and loot purposes.No one goes to Tipt and Vxed saying &quot;omg look at the l33t exp&quot;.Its to get flagged and the LOOT.If you want EXP right now, Eles are still the way to go<br />

I don't know about you, mang, but f'real, the AA and Leader XP you pull down in Vxed is nice as hell, with the possibility of drops and spells just serving to beef it up.  Plus, you can start a Vxed instance and hammer away at it for XP for an hour or two, then swap out for folks that need the flag itself, and they'd have half the killing or more done for them already!<br />
<br />
Besides, who the hell wants to spend any more time in Earth?  I haven't set foot in PoP since GoD release except for Time runs and PoT/PoK- and I'm glad as hell about that too.<br />

Aura of Hate should get buffed up to have duration &gt; recast btw !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u211"><b>shadowedspawn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p211">Trondir I agree whole heartedly.  The way it is now it is actually better to have 2 SK's in a group casting it.  I cast when it fades other casts.  Doing that myself and another SK have been able to keep a group perma buffed w/ it.  As the spell is now it's ok but they just reall need to up the duration and I wouldnt mind if they buffed the atk a bit more also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u212"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p212">The duration is the drawback to have the ability to group Avatar for a measly 200 mana or whatever AoH costs.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u214"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p214">For 500 mana you can keep your group 2/3rd of the time in a 6 minute duration with a 130ish displayed attack buff that drops off over time to about 100 at the end.  Compare to this, a Beastlord can spend 1800 mana in 6 minutes to keep Ferocity on 3 people for 200 displayed attack.<br />
<br />
And you don't think it's overpowered?  Err, okay.<br />
<br />
If anything Aura of Hate needs to be weaker, not stronger.  I don't think you guys really understand how good you have it.  If there's at least 3 melees in the group, including yourself, then you buff better than a class that's supposed to buff attack.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I never said I didnt think it was overpowered I jsut expressed what I thought it should be like.  Notice one suggestion even has it stealing less atk and slace for a longer period.  I asked what the buff form avatar is casue I have never had a primal weapon and w/ the emerald cost it was resevred for the rogues and ranger before our shaman got FA.  <br />

Malos/sinia, Tash, HoS... none of these affect a mob's Disease Resist.  The Decay line, Scent of Terris (obscure necro debuff), and Occlusion of Sound are disease debuffs, and yer not gonna see 'em used very often.<br />

thats pure bullshit, the other taps have duration &gt; recast. THe downside of AoH is that it takes a spellgem, and SKs sure as hell dont have alot of those.<br />
<br />
having AoH fade way before recast is up is a major annoyance of this spell. At least lower the recast so much it can be kept up all the time. You also SO forget that AOH is pure ATK; ferocity also gives alot more.<br />

Exactly what difference does it make to have longer duration or not on a spell you must cast every 72 seconds.  You can get 100 attack for 2/3rd of the time, or 66 attack for 100% of the time.  That's an improvement?</div></div><hr />

<br />
-Partha ... let me translate that from TSW-rhetoric to english:<br />
&quot;warriors are now in godmode and want to stay that way&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
-Zotha/Galleris/trondir/frax/wandor<br />
I bet it took you hours for you guys to think that up...<br />
&quot;Increase Melee Mitigation by 45%&quot;  (warriors naturally mitigate more than knights even before the DI *.95)<br />
We both know how defensive actually works...  and we both know I meant in a raid perspective.<br />
Its actually much greater than that due to the fact most knights even with 10500+HP are one-rounded vs these ... (spike damage)<br />
<br />
If we took 5 warriors and 5 knights and kept track of the amount of damage they absorbed and the amount of damage mitigated (maximum - damage taken)<br />
we both know the average for warriors would be a GREAT deal larger than 50% more.  Against these 1300/sec, one-rounded knights would be the norm<br />
and the warriors would all stand for at least as long as their discipline lasted...  nevermind the fact they can now chain disciplines.<br />
Knights are terrible at spike damage mitigation... this is just plain silly as they are supposed to be the second best tank in the game.<br />
Oh yah, I can tank after I have all the endgame gear... but keep in mind we tank selected mobs in time with enchanters now...<br />
in fact... there are more enchanter tank (anyone) than knight tank mobs...<br />
<br />
<br />
-Vikos<br />
lets turn it around... Isn't it SUPPOSED to be that knights taunt better?  aren't we SUPPOSED to have it as easy as we did in comparison to warriors<br />
back in PoP?  Warriors were (and are) in Godmode for raids, aren't knights supposed to be better for XP groups?  Warriors COULD taunt, just not as<br />
well as knights... isn't that fair?<br />
<br />
/irony off<br />
<br />
The problem is the DIFFERENTIAL, not that warriors are better.  Just like the issue with warrior taunt.  Now warriors taunt differential was made<br />
almost that of knights (in some cases better) and still maintain their rediculous lead in heavy tanking.  Knights tank these MUCH MUCH worse than<br />
warriors used to taunt in XP groups.<br />
<br />
Name ONE spell that is HALF as good as defensive...  hell name 8 of them...  I promise you, tanking 1300/sec hitters, you will not find ANY spell<br />
lineup that allows you to absorb damage even in an equally-equipped warrior's league...  disciplines are instant and never fail.  I promise you<br />
that you would not be able to cast every spell while getting hit for 2k+...<br />
I always consider what the spellbook DOES in relation to the character.  Spells are PART of everything I do...<br />
Integrated with my DPS, my tanking, and everything else.. but the simple fact of the matter is, knights usually cannot bring their spells into <br />
heavy tanking as they are usually dead before the casting finishes.<br />
<br />
Brik is a SHADOWKNIGHT FYI.  My spells add DPS and have personal utility.<br />
Due to poor design decisions, SK's utility in a raid consists of an extra 100 mana and 200 hp every 60 seconds for their group.<br />
(Ill explain AoH later)<br />
<br />
you live in a dream of what you think the knight is... and not anywhere close to reality.  <br />
You can keep your dream, and pay in godmode only a little longer.  It will be fixed soon.<br />
I hope someday you will grow out of your fascination with insults that do little more than highlight your mental maturity.<br />
Disagree with me? fine...  now prove your points without resorting to namecalling...<br />
<br />
<br />
-Zito<br />
I want a DIFFERENT trick...  one that takes my mana to do something I cannot currently handle and something I SHOULD be relatively good at.<br />
Warriors are no longer one-trick ponies...  maybe you should play some more??  try a knight once...  try just transition-tanking just once.<br />
<br />
<br />
-Wilhelmm<br />
I am noting the hypocrisy of the warriors here...  some of you know the frustration of which the knights speak...  the whole argument you<br />
used before has been turned around and you refuse to see it.  Your weakness has been patched, and yet your rediculous advantage is still there.<br />
Personally, I favored EXACTLY what was patched in...  a method for warriors to add numerical aggro...  and its the most powerful and most<br />
useful melee enchancement you got.  Funny that...  a Shadowknight who understands aggro...  AND balance.<br />
<br />
My parses are MINE...  A guildie and I parse it in many places and many mobs and over long periods of time and the average is about 12% now...<br />
I have never understood your foot fetish...  but I do understand your lack of understanding.  I cannot say I am surprised...<br />
<br />
<br />
-Iandrain<br />
Thank you for a well thought out post.  We disagree in solution, but I can respect your solution as a possibility.<br />
<br />
<br />
-Frod<br />
Feh, just for fun... (not really arguing with you)<br />
HT divided by refresh time (with 42 AAXP in it) is like 3.3DPS total!!<br />
Yes, the point of it is burst DPS... its eye-candy...  but at least it IS that now...<br />
<br />
<br />
-Phantron<br />
AoH is not used on Raids ever...  why?<br />
-Doesn't stack with Fero<br />
-Takes up a buff slot<br />
-Cannot be cast before the battle(takes up a spell gem)<br />
-Doesn't refresh fast enough<br />
<br />
Seriously...  given its downsides, it really should go the duration of the recast...<br />
but I would be happy with it if it just went to the short-duration buff box.<br />
(all of our group auras should)<br />
<br />
neg75 disease resist adj spells hit often in XP groups, and about 20-50% on raid targets not immune to disease.<br />

Funny you should mention that. One of the better groups I have been in was SK/Cleric/Druid/Wizard/Wizard/Ench. Trash mobs where trivial due to 3 of us liberally using 8 sec stuns, bosses dropped like rocks between HT+MB (around 18k damage on inc). With C5, horse, Zevfeer's, and a mana robe+regen out the arse casting manaburn didnt even slow the group down since we could be back at a reasonable level of mana in 90 seconds.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Hummm.... I don't get the wizard Telkin to stick on trash mobs...  the Chanter Color Cloud works though. Did wizards have the new stun spell (talikin or whatever.... Never tried tarnation wiht the cleric.... ManaBurn does like 1.7 HP of damage for each mana... With focus and whatnot you can do like 6-10HP of damge per mana with other spells.... is that wise to use manaburn like that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u226"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p226">PREFACE: All due apologies to the moderators and the other posters.<br />
<br />
 BRIK:<br />
<br />
 -Partha ... let me translate that from TSW-rhetoric to english:<br />
&quot;warriors are now in godmode and want to stay that way&quot; <br />
<br />
 There IS NO RHETORIC, YOU MINDLESS GLOB OF PUSTULENT FLESH.<br />
<br />
 Godmode? What game do you play, anyways? It's not the EQ WE'RE all familiar with, where we were beaten out of XP groups 999 times out of 1000 in PoP thanks to snap aggro, where our HP gap was reduced through 'Knightemization' (I await my coming PoN ban :rolleyes:), and where our raid role was reduced to the point where there was NO CONTENT IN THE GAME WHERE WARRIOR SURVIVABILITY MEANT DICK.<br />
<br />
 Every expansion I've seen you post on has been the SAME WHINE over and over and over ad infinitum ad nauseum. You want the ability to tank ALL content EXACTLY the same as Warriors WHILE retaining your entire spellbook. Furthermore, you want to tank it exactly the same AT THE EXACT MOMENT THE CONTENT IS OPENED.<br />
<br />
 No, sir. The history of EQ is a simple one - too complex for your lizard brain, but I shall try again. <br />
<br />
 IN NEW EXPANSIONS, WARRIORS TANK THE CUTTING EDGE CONTENT. KNIGHTS ONLY TANK CONTENT AFTER IT HAS BEEN DEFEATED.<br />
<br />
 It was this way in Kunark.<br />
<br />
 It was this way in Velious.<br />
<br />
 It was this way in Luclin.<br />
<br />
 The ONLY reason it was different at ANY point of PoP was because Warrior aggro generation was allowed to fall too far behind the other two tank classes. Had Warriors had Incite available to them at the beginning of PoP, Knights would have been the choice for almost ZERO content in PoP as top tank, outside of the encounters SPECIFICALLY designed for them.<br />
<br />
 You got spoiled, plain and simple. Now that your moment of spoiling is done, and balance has been restored, you're whining again. Gee, go figure.<br />
<br />
 I'll list the facts once again for your palsied mind, try and keep up.<br />
<br />
 1) This expansion is less than one month old.<br />
<br />
 2) Even WITH that, Knightemization has allowed a larger portion of Knights to tank the same content in GoD at the same time, even WITH the melee revamp.<br />
<br />
 3) If you can't tank it, you need better gear, better strats, or a new game to play. If you can't cut it where other SK's can, the fault lies not with the encounter, not with the class, not with the developer. It lies solely with the person behind the keyboard of your SK.</div></div><hr />

Knight should never had been able to tank the top end content. There is no reason a knight should be able to tank in Ikkinz's trials, these are top end content , flagging event. Just like no knight should have been able to tank the top mobs of PoP with PoP gear.<br />
Ikkinz trials ARE not xp group, knight can still tank no problem in any xp group as well or even better than a war. I can't believe a knight is complaining he can't tank a 1300 dps mob with 1 cleric.</div></div><hr />

No it only took me 1.7 seconds to realize you are a complete tool and dont have a clue what youre talking about. You clearly dont have a clue how defensive (or even the &quot;5&quot;% melee mitigation change) work. <br />
<br />
Your entire idea/rant is based on 3 trials. From your cluelessness and lack of a mangelo posted, ill assume you havent even been into these. These are not done for xp, the xp blows. They arent done purely for loot, most the loot is mana augs and Glyphed rings. Theyre done purely for guild progress. Add to that the fact that my guildmaster tanked 3 Pixxt's in a row without dying, with ZERO GoD loot. He is a paladin, this was the first time the guild set foot in one of these trials. The group lost vs the Diabolic sure, but that wasnt due to tanking it was due to CC not being able to handle all the adds.<br />
<br />
The entire foundation of your ire is a couple of progress events that your class can infact tank if they are geared well enough, well boo-fucking-hoo, grow the fuck up. <br />
<br />
Warriors are no closer to &quot;godmode&quot; now then we ever have been. But keep trying, maybe if you frantically flail your arms enough someone will notice you and youll be rescued from the sea of your own stupidity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u230"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p230">#1<br />
<br />
People are really overestimating the gear required for these Trials....<br />
<br />
They arnt designed for Time++ LDON Guilds as Wandor was saying. I've beat all on various characters (havnt beat 1 with Madrone yet) And as Wandow so elequently pointed out in the ealier parts of this hread my guild isnt a super duper farmed + LDON Raids. We've beat Quarm 5 times total... Definatly have a good amount of time gear in group but not time gear in every slot, not Warriors with DBoTWL/EoE, not people with  5 Quarm loots.<br />
<br />
#2 <br />
<br />
Having something happen Once or twice out of MANY tries does not mean its balanced, relying on RNG to win is not balanced it does not rely on player skill, it does rely a little on gear, but when Knights with 1k HP + 500 More AC more then the warriors I use to tank these mobs can only do it rarely, and it is  a risk, that is an outliner, not the norm.<br />
<br />
#3<br />
<br />
While atm it is not needed for everyone to do it for progression, it is really demorlizing and quite frankly gay to have to sit on sidelines while peope push towards new content not because of your playtime, not beacuse of your gear, not beacuse of your skill, not because of anything you can really change, but just beacuse of your class.<br />
<br />
#4 <br />
<br />
The loot, while the loot may not be needed for people who have exsenstivily farmed time, it is very good upgrades for early - Mid Time level guilds, which the content becomes possible at, so saying people dont do them for loot and only for progression it is for progression, but many mobs that are good for progression also drop loot, and are farmed (Hi Rallos Zek)<br />
<br />
#5 Despite all this I am still at a loss at exactly how to fix this, inevitably if you make it possible for other class's to better fill the spots you make it easier for the power groups that and hence name make it easier for other guilds to get content for I dnt really know how to solve this except for really redising counters dtrastically...<br />
<br />
So in Summary. I do think its a problem, most notably because the trials are FUN, and sititng on sideliens beacuse of class is really gay, however I do understand reasons why they are designed the way they are I just dont like it and hope their is a good solution to it.</div></div><hr />

So Paladins and Shadow Knights plowed through PoP in GOD MODE all the way <br />
<br />
Ok maybe I missed it but can someone explain to me how knights were in &quot;god mode&quot; please.</div></div><hr />

 It was BrikBludgard(tm) 'god mode', which seems to involve the imbibing of lots of illegal substances and usually (tho not in the case of it's creator) leads to the hapless user jumping off a tall building while insisting he can fly.</div></div><hr />

as in agrolock followed by instant tash / slow, gimping the mob you fought after 1 round of melee already. I remember when pulling a Kriger in BoT was already exciting, as you never really knew if the mob would resist first slow and then splat the shaman with the agro!</div></div><hr />

Good god, why.  Why cant they fix the bugs, instead?  The pile of bones in the first temple, the summoner ring, the third Ikkinz trial.  These are all bugged to hell on my server.  I dont mean they are &quot;unnecessarily difficult,&quot; I mean that when the proper set of circumstances are put into place, the WRONG thing happens, or nothing happens.<br />
<br />
Do I wanna tank better?  Yes, I wanna fucking tank better.  Hopefully, with gear from the new expansion, that'll happen LATER.  I may be a whiny bitch who wants the world given to me on a silver platter, but fixing the goddamn content would benefit more than just me.</div></div><hr />

Personally I didnt get any more tells for groups during that time then I did before, and I have always used the same spells/types for pulling/tanking IE snare.  <br />
<br />
I also hope that they dont change how the trails are now.  If they do then someones goign to want me along to tank and I dont stand up well to mobs hitting hard =\.  I much rather sit back and focus on putting the hurt to a mob.</div></div><hr />

There are some screencaps posted on my guild board from when our server was down this past weekend for 24hrs, and most of our server population floated on the chat server out of boredom.  The screencaps are of a Developer talking to a person in my guild in tells on the chat server about this issue.   <br />
<br />
I won't post them here without that dev's explicit permission, and since I have no way to contact this person, it won't be posted by me. I posted it as a 'rumor' because I was not a part of the conversation.  Call it a semi-confirmed rumor if you want, I belive the conversation was real and truthful.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u249"><b>Brodda Thep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p249">Well, Diabolical Destroyer definately has less hp now.  Went from 150k hp to 100khp.  Probably about right, but it certainly makes DD one of the easier mobs to tank for knights.  The named in each trial will be harder for knights to tank than anything else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u250"><b>BrikBludgaard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p250">Apparently, no one has pointed out that warriors' godmode stacks with slow as well...<br />
<br />
Oh, and warriors taunt just as well as knights now....  gee whiz... where does that leave us?  (still better 99% of the time?)<br />
<br />
Oh, and for the curious...  my mom worked at a chemical dependency unit...  illegal substances would have been more painful for me than any possible other pastime.  Even math, science and logic were much preferred subjects than drugs...<br />
<br />
Of course, I don't know what you consider illegal substances either... (i suppose logic might be &quot;illegal&quot; for some people...)<br />
<br />
Note, that despite your anger and your insults, and you namecalling; not a single reason why knights shouldn't be better raid tanks has been posted.<br />
<br />
Not a single one.<br />
<br />
Keep bitching against it please...  its even more attention called to it.  The more visible, the more likely a change.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your support.<br />
(its definitely entertaining too)<br />
