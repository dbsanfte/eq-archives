<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnowm</div><div class="date">06-22-2004, 03:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was bored at work &amp; reading the druid boards &amp; there was a post about the beheading of Nick Berg &amp; was SHOCKED at what some people were saying. In addition to the typical garbage about US policy being responsible for terrorism a few posters went so far as to say what went on at Abu Graiv ( spelling? ) is far worse than the ruthless beheading of an american CIVILIAN, even going so far as saying what happened to him is far more humane than the TORTURE ( panties on the head is that bad? ) the US military has imposed on muslims in IRAQ &amp; the cuban prison. How the F#CK can people really think like this??? People need to wake the f%ck up &amp; realize these people are the enemy, the are brutal, sadistic,  &amp; have ZERO regard for human life. The terrorists are not a result of US policy, the terrorist HATE us, they HATE our freedoms &amp; HATE our way of life. Terrorist wouldnt think twice about killing you or your loved ones. For the most part Islam goes AGAINST everything America stands for. Practicing any religion but Islam in Afganistan under the Taliban was punishible by DEATH, March 15 2002  the Saudi Religious Police were responsible for the death of 15 school girls, they refused to let them evacuate a burning school because they werent wearing their head scarves so they let them burn to death.  WAKE THE F#CK UP people!! Is this the kind of peacefull religion you want to defend?? <br />
<br />
I posted this ( sorry if this kind of post isnt allowed ) because the recent killing of Paul Johnsons father really got to me. Did anyone see Paul Johnson's son pleading on TV for the terrorist to release his father?? All I could think of while I was trying to enjoy Father's Day with my father was what this poor guy &amp; his family must be going through &amp; how he will never be able to enjoy a fathers day with his father again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They also give a minimum of 2% of their entire net worth, not just annual salary, to the poor?  Or is it that they believe in standing by their fellow man no matter what?  These are 2 of the 5 pillars of the Islamic faith, the other 3 being purification by fasting, daily prayer and belief in the oneness of god.<br />
<br />
I myself don't believe in any religion, but I'd like to hear how you come to the conclusion that it is the Islamic faith and the Islamic people that are the enemies of America?  That's a very broad, and not to sound to condescending, asinine statement.<br />
<br />
Yes, some people of the Islamic faith have done some horrific things, then again, so has just about every other religion out there.  Do not condemn the whole for the actions of a few.  And before someone comes back talking about &quot;Jihad&quot; and holy war against Americans I would like to clear something up for you.  The literal translation of Jihad is Struggle.  There are 3 levels of Jihad in the Islamic faith:  Heart - Believing and acting as a member of Islam should.  Tongue - Speaking ones commitment to God, and Physical - To stay true to Islam no matter what physical punishments.  The Koran does mention war and does mention that war is sometimes necessary, but it is by no means holy.  The word Jihad has been twisted by American media to mean something it doesn't to inspire fear and hatred of a people that by in large, do not deserve it.  Hate terrorists, but realize that they do not represent the people of the Islamic nation.<br />
<br />
Practicing any religion but Islam in Afganistan under the Taliban was punishible by DEATH<br />
<br />
The Christian faith used to do the exact same thing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The same goes for being american, whatever our government does other people blame on each american even tho they could have had no part in what is going on, and another good thing to remember is that everyone can put their own spin on things, and they will, which is why alot of country's hate americans with no good reason other than &quot;they are assholes&quot;<br />
<br />
Personaly I think the american government had made the video since his last letter to his family had stated he was being help at an american checkpoint, in the video they have the wrong accent, slip into speaking russian and one of them has a GOLD RING ON, it is agenst the muslim religion to adorn yourself with rings! that is a big hint this guy isnt an extremist, you can also see an american hat peak into the side of the video and when the man gets &quot;head cut off&quot; you noticed the blood didnt spray? his corpse didnt jerk? any doctor would tell you those guys would be covered in blood, and their would be a spray of blood from that kind of a decapitation, sorry to be so morbid but i think this was staged to overshadow the prison pictures story in the news.<br />

there is so much more to this, a good link a friend sent me while I talked with him is<br />

since i wanted to look deeper into it than the general bullshit the media gives me, now this week we hear that the terrorists somehow got our uniforms from the people we had helping us, why we gave out our uniforms ill never know, i just think it was closing a loose end.<br />
<br />
also it is odd that they have the same chairs as the prison where the photo scandles took place....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">06-22-2004, 04:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Let me ask a question here, to perhaps shed some perspective on the situation.  Do the extreme Christian fanatics who strongly believe that killing Doctors who perform abortions is proper and just represent the majority of Christians?  Do the the people who blow up clinics because they believe their religion tells them to represent the majority of Christians?  I would argue that regardless of their personal beliefs as to the sinfulness or wrongness of abortions, most Christians do not advocate shooting people or blowing up people and places as the appropriate way of dealing with it.  Islam has millions of believers.  It is an extremely large religion.  And as with any large religious group of human beings there are people who claim they follow the teachings and live by its tenents but who in reality don't.<br />
<br />
The United States is facing a grave test in Iraq these days.  We've gotten into a situation that is going to be difficult to extract ourselves from.  And we have really done everything we should have as far as following our own beliefs as a nation and adhering to what we claim to believe is right?  We're not pure and unsoiled in our actions either, are we?  Granted one can argue that the degree of violation is different, cutting off people's heads is certainly worse than moderate to extreme psychological torture, but then there are still unresolved accusations of rape and some investigations still pending as to whether or not people died as a result of some of our soliders actions.  We certainly not pure as the driven snow, even if that doesn't justify the response.<br />
<br />
It is certainly reasonable to hate the people who killed Paul Johnson.  It isn't necessarily reasonable to hate all Muslims.  It is certainly reasonable to say that the people who killed Paul Johnson performed an act that is worse than those acts we know of performed on people (some of whom were civilians as well, since you seem to feel the difference is important) in Abu Graiv.  But it isn't necessarily reasonable to claim that the people mistreated in Abu Graiv were deserving of being treated that way or that we are justified after the fact for having mistreated them because of Paul Johnson's death.  Two wrongs do not make a right.  One wrong does not justify the other.  If the people who killed Paul Johnson are wrong in what they did, and I agree that they are, then we need to also accept that the actions commited in Abu Graiv by our troops are also wrong.<br />
<br />
The moral high ground requires that you espouse a code and a belief system and do everything humanly possible to adhere to it.  We failed in Abu Graiv.  We need to do better.  But we can still hate the people who killed Paul Johnson for being murderers.</div></div><hr />

Actually what you're talking about is different societies, not just a &quot;religion&quot;.  Those states are their own independent entities.  But if we're going to throw stones, we need to expect stones to be thrown back, and we do live in a house of glass.<br />
<br />
How about a country where a man can be filmed being beaten by the police for a prolonged period while all he does is lie there being pummeled and their defense is he was &quot;resisting&quot;?  Rodney King ring a bell?  How about a country where a police department can be so full of corruption that you can't tell the cops from the crooks and the police routinely plant drugs and guns on people they don't like and even go so far as shoot them, cripple them, and then get them sent to jail for resisting arrest that wasn't resisted?  Look up the background on the L.A. Rampart division.  How about in New York where a black man was shot 15 times because he reached around to pull his wallet out of his pocket to identify himself and it was taken as being a gun?<br />

I am not here to justify any of those actions, because like you I have no first hand knowledge of these events.  You are condemning these people now because their beliefs are different then your own?  Sure, some things some Muslims have done would be considered barbaric by western standards, but that's just it, they are western standards.  But answer me this, a few years ago a black man was tide to the back of a truck and dragged to his death here in America.  Do you now say that all Americans are bigots that kill non-whites in unimaginably violent ways?  You listed above the actions of about 20 people of the Islamic faith, 20 people out of the worlds most prolific religion and you say that is enough evidence to damn them all.  I may live in a flowery world as you say, but I'll be damned if I'm going to be ignorant enough to declare the world my enemy because they believe differently then me.<br />
<br />
And as for people in the Middle East dancing in the street during the WTC tragedy, what the fuck would you do if what you believed was a world tyrant finally got a little pay back?  They, like us, have been mislead by the government and media.  We are not all megalomaniacal power hungry tyrants looking to rule the world under the iron fist of western ideology, nor are they all terrorists dead set on killing every American they see.  If anyone needs to open their eyes, it's you.  Look beyond the bullshit you are being fed by the media and the government, there are two sides to every story and we are not 100% right.</div></div><hr />

Let me get this straight your comparing a crack head who was high on drugs that was speeding over 100MPH &amp; failed to pull over ( btw how would you feel if this jackass had hit &amp; killed your parents on the highway?? ) to a government ( Saudi's ) organization that chose to let INNOCENT FUCKING SCHOOL CHILDREN BURN TO DEATH because if they were see in public w/o their fucking head scarves someone might of been offended!!!!!!!!!!<br />
<br />
The Police in the Rodney King case went over the line, however it had NOTHING to do with religion. That you can even compare the two fucking amazes me.</div></div><hr />

I can only assume you are speaking of the Islamic faith and their treatment of women.  Correct me if I'm wrong.  But going under that assumption for the moment, I need to yet again clarify the Islamic faith and separate it from the American media portrayal.<br />
<br />
The reason women are required to wear a full burka in the Islamic faith is because they are considered to be very powerful creatures in the Muslim world.  Most Islamic women choose to wear the burka because they feel it's empowering, it allows them to reveal themselves only to those they choose.  There are allot of things that we are shown as women not being allowed to do in the Muslim world, but again, this is mostly American media spin.  We are shown a very small population of Muslim women saying they don't like things and then we blow this up into all Muslim women are horribly oppressed.  It's simply not true, the vast majority of Muslim women believe deeply in their faith and their traditions.</div></div><hr />

It's really hard to take someone seriously who calls me a fuckstick.  It's original, I'll admit.  But it's not particularly clever nor does it give your argument much in the way of credibility.  I'm going to mark you up as being a troll, and not a particularly good one at that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is a thing called cultural relativism, that states that it is impossible in pratice and principle, for one culture to judge another cultures customs/beliefs. I think teaching this prinicple to all American, and the world in general, would go a long way in resolving conflicts in the future.</div></div><hr />

If say Mass had broken away &amp; formed its own little country &amp; was still burning witches at the stake, according to you we shouldnt look down on them? Is that your point? When a country is so backwards ( either politcally or religiously ) ,according to you, nobody has a right to question them or call them on it?? Did you agree with the US &amp; UN putting political &amp; economic pressure on South Africa to end apartheid? If you remain consistant with your &quot;who are we to tell any other culture we are better than them&quot; attitude you must think what happened to the white culture in South Africa is worse than the holocaust?</div></div><hr />

If you remain consistant with your &quot;who are we to tell any other culture we are better than them&quot; attitude you must think what happened to the white culture in South Africa is worse than the holocaust?<br />

No, my point is that every culture and religion in history has done something that current western culture would disagree with.  You say we have &quot;evolved&quot; from that, I say we have merely experienced a shift in cultural norms.  Now you are condemning people you know dickall about because they might believe in something that your cultural norm frowns upon, but at one point in history practiced as well.  I use the word might believe because your views of other cultures is so skewed be western media that it can't be called even mildly correct on any points.  So instead of watching TV for a few hours then comings to these boards to spew your hatred, how bout you take some time and actually learn something about the culture you are condemning.</div></div><hr />

since i wanted to look deeper into it than the general bullshit the media gives me, now this week we hear that the terrorists somehow got our uniforms from the people we had helping us, why we gave out our uniforms ill never know, i just think it was closing a loose end.<br />
<br />
also it is odd that they have the same chairs as the prison where the photo scandles took place....<br />

I guess we flew the planes into the world trade center also. God what an Idiot</div></div><hr />
