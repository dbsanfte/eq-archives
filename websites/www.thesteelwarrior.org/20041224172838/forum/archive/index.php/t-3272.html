<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arhallia</div><div class="date">09-26-2003, 03:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A link to my original post on the Magician's Tower board:<br />
<br />
http://forum.magecompendium.com/tower/viewtopic.php?t=7862<br />
<br />
<br />
I'll cut and paste the original post here for those Warriors who have lost both arms in combat.  ;) With the discussion thread info I should probably modify it slightly (namely in regards to the way Taunt appears to work, and the amount of Hate the mage recieves when he/she sends in a pet), but the basic premise is the same in any case.<br />
<br />
The basic idea is that Pet &quot;movement&quot; AI and Pet &quot;choose target&quot; AI appear to respond differently to the Hate list -- mostly due to the &quot;always attack a nearby player&quot; change a while back to stop people from using DC pets in Kael to tank mobs like Vindi and the AoW.<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
I wanted to start a discussion on this topic to establish its validity and find errors in this theory.<br />
<br />
Presumably, pets maintain their position on the agro list of a mob, no matter whether or not a player is near.  The NPC agro code will always choose to attack a player over a nearby pet, but will return to attacking the pet if:<br />
<br />
A) The pet's position in the Hate list is higher than any other players in the area.<br />
<br />
and<br />
<br />
B) The players on the Hate list are all out of melee range.<br />
<br />
<br />
Example Hate list of mob BadGuyX:<br />
<br />
Character:.....Hate Value:.....Player?.....In melee range?<br />
Jobober..........800................No............Yes<br />
Cleric1...........750................Yes...........No<br />
Warrior2.........700................Yes...........Yes<br />
Paladin3.........400................Yes..........Yes<br />
Mage4............0....................Yes..........No<br />
<br />
...in this case, the Warrior gets agro, despite the cleric being higher on the hate list!  The reason being that the mob chooses to stay near the character on the top of the Hate list, but attacks the nearest player within melee range ...due to the fact that they are a player, and are within melee range. ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thus, the theory is:<br />
<br />
* The main tank will effectively keep agro as long as a pet in near proximity is higher on the hate list than the highest player is.<br />
<br />
If this theory is true, then the DDD pet may be extremely useful, particularly if equipped with (for example) stun whips and a dex buff.  (I think 61+ pets may generate enough agro to out-agro the DDD, however -- but thats 61, and DDD is 56)<br />
<br />
In a sense, a high agro pet can potentially be as useful as some degree of &quot;reverse&quot; Spell Casting Subtlety for the entire group, at least for the mob(s) engaged by the pet.<br />
<br />
In addition, a highly dex buffed, stun whip equipped pet may be very useful to send in with the &quot;agro building&quot; tank, on raids using that strategy.  The mage who sends in the pet gets added to the Hate list, but maintains a hate of 0 (and thus sticks to the bottom), unless he/she stupidly sits down and raises their temporary Hate above that of the tank and pet.<br />
<br />
<br />
The idea of pets generating more agro than a warrior may be foreign to those who play in a lot of 65 groups with uber taunt weapons, but there are a lot of lower level warriors in the game who have a *lot* of trouble generating more hate than your typical pet from a mage of the same level.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was in an all pets group on my beastlord... 2 mage, 3 nec and me the beastlord and once all the pets engaged, I could engage and the pets would keep the agro off of me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GorfinML</div><div class="date">09-26-2003, 05:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">(posting as a 65 druid who charm kills quite a bit)<br />
<br />
thats pretty sound, except for the 4position rule: that rule is(not fact, not confirmed, but mearly my statement from many many months of charming) if there is more that 4 people and pets on a mobs hate list, the mob will attack the PC that is highest on the hate list, reguardless of pets hate.<br />
<br />
ex1: 1druid + pet and 1 enc + pet killing in tactics.  except for tast/snare/slow on the initial Inc of the mob, the pets will tank with out losing aggro.<br />
<br />
ex2: same group as above, but add a cleric now.  the pets tank fine UNTILL the cleric does something to get on the mobs hate list.  then the mob goes wacko(wacko meaning sometimes he atttacks the pets, sometimes the enc , and somtiems the cleirc or druid, i havent seen a exactly pattern to the aggro for this yet)<br />
<br />
ex3: 1druid + pet, and magi+pet, and wizzy....as in ex2, aggro will be locked on the Pet untill the wizzy does soemthing to get on the aggro list<br />
<br />
ex4: add a warrior to ex3.  if the warrior is tanking, as long as he has enough aggro, he should always hold aggro.  HOWEVER, if the warrior is using ranged weapon(bow) for somereason, then the mob will ping pong around(more specificly he'll chase the person with the most aggro, that is NOT a pet)<br />
<br />
i've found this to hold true in atleast, POD and POTactics.  try it in other zones and you'll see the same thing i'm betting<br />
<br />
conclusion:  after 5 pc's or pets on a mobs hate list, the mob will aggro on the nearest PC with the highest aggro<br />
<br />
exceptions: i'm sure there are exceptions to this(if in fact it  is true), and one of them is Root aggro(aggro on the nearest pc/pet when the mob is rooted)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baadan</div><div class="date">09-26-2003, 05:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like to work with pet classes that I'm grouped with because mobs really seem to stop when they hit a pet.. ie when a rangers runs by with a mob on him, pet is sent in a mob attacks pet immediately. I can do the same usually but having a pet doing it also is pretty much gaurunteed that the mob isn't going passes the front line made up of the pet and I.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mokor Leadheaad</div><div class="date">09-26-2003, 09:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">humm, in my experence the mob goes for the pet owner if the pet+owner agro greater then mine. especialy if the pet owner is sitting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arhallia</div><div class="date">09-27-2003, 05:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sitting adds temporary hate that puts the pet owner on the *top* of the hate list -- not something the theory is concerned with. :)<br />
<br />
If you're on top, you're on top -- and you get agro.  That much is obvious I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mellen</div><div class="date">12-05-2003, 04:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">About Gorfin's post... that's a rule that was put in to curb charmed pets in pop holding aggro and tanking big kills (and effectively gimping plenty of encounters) and I'm pretty sure applies just to charmed pets.<br />
<br />
I know personally in time there were a lot of times when we were learning mobs I would assist off them and get pet names if no melee were in range.   They of course died quick but the fact that the gods did not ping pong until the pets died would speak against that rule applying to summoned pets.</div></div><hr />
