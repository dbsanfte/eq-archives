<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tasso</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">read on eqlive whats coming in the next patch<br />
Newbie quests will be added for Erudites, Trolls and Ogres. <br />
<br />
guess we can all stop bitching about class balance and aggro  now right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">wait my prayer was for jenna jamenson to be naked on my lap.  COme on man get your priorities in order.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What a complete pile of crap.<br />
<br />
Idiots. Do you have a friggin clue about how to keep your customers happy, or do you even really give a crap about a class that nearly every class in the game agree needs fixing, and badly?<br />
<br />
Obviously newbie quests are more important than fixing the REAL issues.<br />
<br />
It's becoming more and more obvious to me that we will never be fixed, that they really could care less, that they take our money, and that's all they care about.<br />
<br />
They're not even ACKNOWLEDGING there's an issue here, let alone even making any sort or effort to address it. In other words, this &quot;Customer Service&quot; is a sham, and Absor's &quot;Community Relations&quot; is nothing but a useless handjob... something that SoE can point to and say that they really care and really do listen. When was the last time Absor ever actually performed any kind of Community Relations with the warrior community? Um. What, 6 months ago? a year? For a guy whose job is supposed to be Community Relations, he's making me feel like the only relation SoE wants is with my credit card company, and I can kindly piss off until the next time it comes for SoE to take its payment, because that's all I'll ever see of em. Except for when it comes to the NEXT expansion, which, of course, I have to shell out MORE bucks for.<br />
<br />
And what really pisses me off... is it's not like we're even asking for the moon, or that we as the warrior community ask for much... but when we do, we're utterly ignored? <br />
<br />
&lt;shakes head&gt;<br />
<br />
What a load of crap.<br />
<br />
Edit: &lt;cough&gt; sorry. I was frustrated at the time... bleh.</div></div><hr />

I haven't found out which bottle yet, but I'm currently &quot;researching&quot; it by getting to the bottom of as many as possible :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
oh, wait...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>arative</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Course its probably the $8.00 an hr intern that is creating and implementing these quests, while the real Devs work on important things like taunt.</div></div><hr />

Holy sh!!t, I better create a level 1 ogre to enjoy the craptastic content!!!!!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Verant-<br />
<br />
Start thinking more about the people that are staying around longer. Believe me, making noob armor for classes that already had the highest stats is FAR lower on the ladder than class balance is (A glaring problem IMHO) <br />
<br />
Oh well, If all fails...this is to verant<br />
<br />
If you work at Verant, click here! (http://www.dubastard.de)<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: Excuse me, Verant is dead. I meant SOE</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Rumblingdeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Okay, you all happy? Quit moronic EQ now, while you can get some $$$ for your char and get ready to play WoW. You aren't getting jack in this game to help, jeez, how come you expect it? Sony HATES melee, HATES!! Got it??!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">And we hate people who quit the game coming to the boards and do nothing but bitch cry moan groan how much he hates SOE.  Dear god like I said it before let it go and play your precious WoW and be prepared for the lagtastic content that it is going to be.  I admit WoW is going to be great but with all they are planning to put in the game you are gonna need one hell of a comp and broadband to escape the rubberband effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">maybe since they always never do what we say we say that they need to make kei ebetter give paladins actually decent hate on stuns and give wizards 8k aoes. then they might learn something and do something correctly.</div></div><hr />
