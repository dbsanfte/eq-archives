<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Travist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">As some of you may have noticed, &quot;Call of time&quot; is broken or ninja downgraded.. Sooo i went ahead posted on eq's warrior message board to find out what the problem was hoping to get a fix .. <br />
<br />
Here was my post: <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Call of Time&quot; Nerf?<br />
Hammer of the timeweaver http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=22894<br />
<br />
<br />
Since the last patch (6/15) the pet from the &quot;call of time&quot; proc seems to have been significantly downgraded. The pet now misses 95% of the time and when the pet doesnt miss it hits for ALOT less then before. 35 dmg !  (less then the class pet weapons that drop in the Elemental planes).  Doesn't make alot of sense for a Quarm weapon's pet to do less dmg then a mediocre Class pet weapon that drops in Ep's.<br />
 <br />
Was this an intended downgrade? <br />
 <br />
<br />
Well had 2 other warriors post about it aswell. <br />
This is the response i recieved :<br />
<br />
<br />
The information I received is that there was no change made to the proc on the Hammer of the Timeweaver.  Perhaps just a bit of bad luck or a tougher beastie...<br />
<br />
Sorry guys.<br />
<br />
Ky<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps just a bit of bad luck or a tougher beastie...&quot;<br />
<br />
This kind of response to upper tier warriors is down right comical...<br />
<br />
If you have the hammer and having the same issue which Im positive ALL of you are... go head over to: <br />
<br />
http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Warriors&amp;message.id=730<br />
<br />
and let this &quot;mod/ dev&quot; know  the proc is indeed Downgraded / broken hopefully that will push it to get fixed..<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

Thats just a sample of a 2 hour log... from the summary for the entire 2 hours:<br />
<br />
Hits = 383<br />
Misses = 260<br />
To Hit % = 59.6%<br />
Max Hit = 415<br />
Min Hit = 35<br />
Average Hit = 255<br />
DPS = 14.76<br />
% 1 = 43%<br />
% 2 = 57%</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have definately noticed a huge downgrade to the weapon. A guildie noticed it happening first and i began mainhanding the Hammer to test it for myself. It seemed to proc about 1/4 less than before and the pets average hit is significantly less. For most of one entire evening the pets didnt hit for more than 55. My highest damage so far since the patch was a tad over 200, no where near the 415 max hit.<br />
<br />
Brenlo has also already locked that thread saying updates will be added to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brudal the Fat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have not seen my pet hit for 415 since the patch. They can downplay it all they want but something was changed for sure, without question and it is not people being paranoid.<br />
<br />
My pet hits for 35 most of the time now and rarely I get a 255 hit in there. It may very well have been an accident but they need to look into it at least and see what the issue is.<br />
<br />
I had a ranger friend test Timespinner and its pet is the same as before, no change.</div></div><hr />

Simlar to the 'alchemy is not broken' comment?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dubb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Just wanted to confirm, this is very real.  Not a single 415 hit since the patch. Not anywhere near it.  <br />
<br />
My pet hits for 35 most of the time now<br />
When he actually hits, so does mine. But he has an incredibly high miss rate now, higher than 80%. If this was an intentional change, it makes no sense at all and really needs to be reevaluated. I hope they realize it's broken and fix it. After 11 months of the hammer being used being used by players on live servers, this change is pointless and inane.</div></div><hr />

Keep making noise until it's acknowledged.  Same as ever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Demorgoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Heard that the devs are aware of the problem and should be fixing it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The weapon/pet wasnt changed, it was something to do with how NPC check weapon skills, the pet was a rogue, but the weapon was 2HS (on the pet), previously NPC's ignored skill checks, but they changed how NPC's check or something, which made the weapon damage go down, because well rogue 2hs is pretty weak,<br />
<br />
it should be fixxed soon and will be the same damage as it was previously<br />
<br />
this is pretty paraphrased btw so speciefics on what caused it might not be correct, but general gist of it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Northerner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Seems unlikely to me.  NPC Rogues backstab regardless of weapon type if nothing else.<br />
<br />
Still, I don't doubt for a second that it's related to recent NPC and pet changes in GoD.  Little Quammer just needs an attack adjustment perhaps?</div></div><hr />

Do you remember where you got this info?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">That information is paraphrased from a dev.<br />
<br />
Before the last patch NPC's ignored the skill restrictions that PC's had for the same class. After this patch that skill was checked, making it bring back a 0 for rogue 2hs - so the pet started sucking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Jazun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Okay.  There's a follow up thread on eqlive forums.  The community person wasn't listening. This is why i wanted to know so that i can link on that thread.</div></div><hr />

I asked last week on Tuesday for this to be looked into.  I asked for an update today and was told that there was indeed a problem with the pet proc.  It should be fixed on Test now.  If anyone checks it out there and it is still acting wonky, please let me know.<br />

It should be in the next patch...but don't take that as set in stone.<br />
