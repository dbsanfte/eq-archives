<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bemyen</div><div class="date">11-14-2003, 02:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Of all the suggestions I have seen in class balancing there is only one that seemed practical without either changing the entire balance of game encounters or making other classes (knights) useless.  I dont remember where I read this (sorry not to give the original poster credit), but why not give warriors fighting styles.  Let warriors have to make a decision on how to fight for a given situation with maybe a 1 min deley in changing style.  I envision maybe 3 &quot;stances&quot;<br />
<br />
Offensive - Gives warriors a boost in dps making them a viable alternative to traditional dps classes.  If you got 2 warrior in a group one tanks and the other goes offensive.  The obvious trade off would be that the loose some mitagation.<br />
<br />
Balanced - Same as warriors are now.  Better offence and mitagation tables as knights but not a huge advantage.<br />
<br />
Defensive - Sorta like a /disc defensive that can be maintained until you switch stances.<br />
<br />
In addition to this an improvement in taunt is needed.  I think things are getting better for the average warrior anger3 augs that dont require a guild to get.  I certainly think a shorter refresh on ae taunt would be a nice boost as well.<br />
<br />
I think this would bring some real utility to warriors.  It provides better stacking of the class in both groups and raids.<br />
<br />
I am intrested on what warriors seriously think about this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dalmoth</div><div class="date">11-14-2003, 02:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Honestly not a bad thought process and something that makes having multiple warriors useful (one of the biggiest issues I overall see with warriors).  Frankly it could also be the first step toward removing /disc defensive and stop using that as a crutch for why certain things can't be done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darkoan</div><div class="date">11-14-2003, 02:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like the styles idea, it's come up before.  I'd prefer more than just the offense/balance/defensive though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">landrain</div><div class="date">11-14-2003, 03:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Warriors need many different styles, and melee effects.. Think of them as feats in 3rd D&amp;D... all the casters get spell upon spell.. while pure melee have gotten... umm.. im sure we got something.. oh yeah Sense Heading = 200... All pure melee need feats.. and ONLY PURE MELEE...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daggorr</div><div class="date">11-14-2003, 03:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Great idea.  How does this sound to further the idea.<br />
<br />
5 stances. Each stance transfers ATK to AC and vice-versa. No time limit between stance shifts other than completeing the current combat round.<br />
<br />
Stance ---- Percent transferred<br />
<br />
1 Berzerk ---- 80% AC to ATK<br />
2 Enraged --- 40% AC to ATK<br />
3 Combat ---- 0% (normal stats)<br />
4 Guarded --- 40% ATK to AC<br />
5 Defensive -- 80% ATK to AC<br />
<br />
(granted exact percentages need to eb tested for game stability but you get the idea)<br />
<br />
This can be done with only some tweaking of AC and ATK caps but with this stance system only avaliable to warriors (since they are the masters of combat after all :D ) this wont throw off other classes even with the best itemization.<br />
<br />
This will allow everyone from the Soloing warrior to the Uber Raid MT to survive more and be more versatile. And it allows multiple warriors in a group some more utility.<br />
<br />
Without any new gear at all you can decide for yourself how much risk you want to take for added DPS or how much aggro you are willing to give up to take less damage.<br />
<br />
Hows this sound so far?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylas</div><div class="date">11-14-2003, 05:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">it require SOE to rewrite the entire way of which combat works in order for the ATK-AC thing to work out.  No amount of AC changes min dmg = DB+ DI, and 3000 AC with 200 ATK is just as good as warrior tanking today, you aren't generating aggro so the mobs are still beating down your enchanter while you stand there spamming the taunt key.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">11-14-2003, 05:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's not that hard really to modify the game with feats, stances, whatever.  You can make them like bard songs.  Like if you have say defensive stance, you can simulate it by having a spell that's like Vie, absorbs 30% of incoming damage (code it not to absorb magic damage) for 100000 damage, and it's refreshed say, every minute while it's maintained, and it'd just use whatever code we currently have that reduces your DPS to roughly half.<br />
<br />
Not that I think stances are the answer, but it sure isn't impossible to implement those.  Not easy, perhaps, but the tools exist.</div></div><hr />
