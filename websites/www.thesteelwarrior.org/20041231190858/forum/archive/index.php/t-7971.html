the crowns are really not that hard to get. wouldnt pay more than 5k.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is opp cost.  If I had one I didn't need, I wouldn't bother lifting a finger to sell a MQ for 5k.  5k isn't worth my time to go do the turn in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LUMMP</div><div class="date">07-09-2004, 01:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another way to look at it is how long it would take you to get a grp of friends together, fight down and do the camp for couple of hours. Figure 2-3 hours for a drop, could be faster, could spend 8 hours and never see one.<br />
<br />
Say 4 hours as a safe estimate of total time invested plus the calling in of favors from friends. Could you make 10k in 4 hours of a decent loot camp? 20k? Depends on what the time involved in getting one yourself is gonna actually cost you.<br />
<br />
Offer 10k see what the guy says. Worst case he says no. Then up it. I did mine myself but if i had it to do again and the MQ was available would just throw cash at it.<br />

At 65 its easy and not that bad of xp camp. Personally I think 10k is on a high end. Its not a rare drop and its not that hard to get.</div></div><hr />

but then i'm a monk and have mend.<br />
pretty sure you could do it though, watch for runners.<br />

(n.b.: if you're lucky you can get to the area behind the fake wall with invis. if not, the room with 5 juggs will pose a problem.)</div></div><hr />
