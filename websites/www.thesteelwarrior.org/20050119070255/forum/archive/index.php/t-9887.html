<br />
I come here seeking advice on a new offhander. My Sandstone Sword did it's job for awhile, but it's getting to the point where the stun portion of the proc isn't landing on things, negating any reason I had in there except for aggro. My thoughts were between Bygone Butcher's Cleaver (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=70188), Sword of Midwinter's Vengeance (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=70250) or a Mace of Memories (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=70226). Offhand I am guessing that an AC debuff isn't quite as high as a stun in terms of aggro, but both of the swords have a better ratio, the SoMV having the best of all three. Are these decent choices, or is there something else (buyable or 1-groupable) that I should be looking for? This isn't my main yet, so I can't request any raid mobs for an upgrade nor spend points on an item that does drop unless it would rot otherwise. Thanks a lot for any help you may have :) <br />
<br />
PS. Any other suggestions would be good, too  :p<br />
<br />
EDIT: Question: I know that DPS aggro is determined by the potential damage of the weapon and not the actual damage that you put out. However, is that the potential damage of the weapon at it's max effectiveness? Or will my lower level (and thus lower damage on the weapon) make the potential DPS-aggro lower? Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">11-30-2004, 10:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">at lvl 56 I rate in offhand BB'sC &lt; MoM &lt; SotB &lt; SoM'sV &lt; CHoS &lt; RS-HS because the requiered lvl of the sandstone is much lower thus you keep your ratio (13/21) while you loose it for others (13/19 insteed of 15/19 ...).<br />
be patient untill you reach better lvl.</div></div><hr />

And 13/19 is still better than 13/21. I don't want to change though if the AC debuff is shitty aggro compared to a stun</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telen</div><div class="date">11-30-2004, 07:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am unfamiliar with any type of objective method of measuring hate.  Subjectively to me stuns seem to be marginally better aggro than the debuff on the BBC.  I mainhanded a SoD for awhile and switched to a BBC and my aggro seemed slightly worse, but the difference was minor.  I sold my SoD to buy a BoC and then offhanded the BBC and my aggro is great now.<br />
<br />
If I had to do it again I'd still buy the BBC.  The reason not being that it is better aggro than a MoM, I'd expect the stun on the MoM to be slightly better aggro.  But the difference is so minor that to me I'd rather just go with which weapon I like the looks of best.  If you like the mace look, go for the MoM.  If you like the big ass sword look get the SoMV.  If you like the hatchet look of the BBC get it.  I really really like the combo look of the BoC with the BBC offhand, just looks sweet.<br />
<br />
If you're all about performance I'd go with the MoM.  Keep in mind that the stun still won't work on mobs past level 55.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gaspie</div><div class="date">11-30-2004, 07:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I generally keep agro well using SoMV and MoM (there are the nuke happies and ubers(450dd+ procs) who steal my agro at times). I don't see the proc on BBC to be very effective. I had a weapon with the same proc and I wasn't keeping agro as well as I did with both droga weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gaspie</div><div class="date">11-30-2004, 07:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I may be mistaken, correct me if I am, but even if the mob is too high to stun won't the agro from the stun still be there? As well as ac debuffs, ie using a weapon with Frostbite and another with Ice Rend?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarcazzm</div><div class="date">11-30-2004, 08:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">that is correct. a lot of times the DD does land in full but the stun component does not.</div></div><hr />
