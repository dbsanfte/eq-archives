<br />
Deflection is one of the best Talents you can get to increase your survivability.<br />
<br />
Tactical Mastery is VERY handy, especially if you'll be expected to tank a lot or will do PVP some.<br />
<br />
Anger Management is somewhat useful.  It definitely helps in the rage department.<br />
<br />
Improved Overpower is great, if somewhat unreliable (because of Overpower, not the talent).<br />
<br />
Can't spear for the rest of the Arms stuff.<br />
<br />
Cruelty is very nice.  It will up your DPS by about 5%, which will also help your threat.<br />
<br />
Anticipation is not going to do much for you during the process of gaining levels, wouldn't bother until later.<br />
<br />
If you're planning on using a 2hander most of the time (I assume you are with MS), Toughness will probably help to offset the lack of shield.  Really depends on what you think your role will be though.<br />
<br />
Improved Revenge is pretty nice, but how often do you think you'll use it?<br />
<br />
I know it seems like I'm down on Protection, but I'm really not.  Those particular skills are just sort of &quot;meh&quot;, except Imp Revenge.</div></div><hr />

If it was me, I'd probably get Cruelty and then start moving up the Arms tree.  When I hit 40, respec to get MS (dropping Cruelty temporarily), and then grab Cruelty again during the next few levels.<br />
<br />
You're probably not going to spend much time in defensive if you're planning to solo a lot, so I wouldn't bother with Imp Revenge until much later.  In fact, I don't know that I'd bother with Protection at all until you catch up with your friends.  Arms are Fury are probably going to provide you with better returns while soloing.</div></div><hr />

If you are going to solo grind then your first priority should be anything that improves your damage output: cruelty, rend, deep wounds, etc...  Even without protection talents, we can take a beating very well, need more offense to speed up those solo fights.<br />
<br />
Gear is obviously very important also, borrow some cash from your level 60 buddies and buy the best weapon you can find in the AH.  Armor is not as big of a deal, you will gear up through quests.</div></div><hr />

Completely agree with the above statement.  That talent list i made up was for solo + minor grouping.  I still think it will do the trick for either.  That said, at 39 I respec'd and deviated from that to boost my solo ability.  Personally, I rarely do pickup groups anymore.  I solo 90% of the time and do guild groups the rest.  We have an abundance of high level Palys so I rarely tank in those groups.  In fact, I generally do what I expected, offtank aggro on multi-pulls and beat down mages while the Palys deal with harder hitting targets.  This has worked fine for me thru RfD and SM recently.<br />
<br />
My latest plan for Talents is very geared toward soloing.  Basically, 31pts in Arms for MS (which I love) and  20pts in Fury for Enrage (very nice ability with 2h weps).  Basically, I dropped Anger Management and a point in TM to get the 2pts I needed to max Enrage.  I barely notice a difference in rage management.  Just 5pts less rage when I switch to Zerker Stance.<br />
<br />
Okay, enough about me.  If I were playing up from lvl10 again, I'd drop my first 5 points in Cruelty.  Then 5deflect, 3rend, 2TM, 2overpower, 3deepwounds, etc.  At 40 respec to get MS and have 5cruelty by lvl45.  From there I'd go Booming Voice, Imp. Shout, Enrage.  That is just to max solo ability tho.  By the time you're in the upper 50s you should know your usual role in groups/raid well enough to respec yourself into whatever warrior you want to be.<br />
<br />
Lets see general advice:  Get your Whirlwind Weapon as soon as you can, preferably in your low 30s with help.  DO NOT buy gear every 2lvls like others have told me to do.  I started buying the Lambent Scale set at lvl15.  It wasn't useable fully til 22.  I saved tons of money by planning gear in advance and not making impulse buys.  The Lambent Set held me over til late 30s just fine.  By then I was looting upgrades.  Chief Brigadier's should be the next set you look at unless you can hold off upgrading til Heavy Mithril at 40-42.  I started buying the full Heavy Mithril set at lvl30.  After that, I saved for a mount.  Last nite I dinged level 40 with a full set of Plate in the bank and over 100G to buy my mount.  It took me one morning of farming to get enough money to buy all the class abilities I neglected from 32-40 (class trainer).  For professions, I chose Mining + Enchanting.  Mining is the most lucrative profession as long as you never take up smithing.  As for Enchanting, I've never enchanted a single piece of gear.  I disenchant my old Soulbound stuff I've replaced and any green/blue items that don't sell in the AH.  I got my last round of enchants completely free b/c I was able to supply all the regeants!<br />
<br />
That's alot to take in, but best of luck to you and enjoy yourself!</div></div><hr />

Seriously.<br />
<br />
There is zero reason to if you have friends that can do instances.  Or if you're smart enough to finish quests.  Or if you're a blacksmith.  There is no gear in the AH before level 60 that you're going to keep until you're 60, so just don't. <br />
<br />
Even blue items that people charge an arm and a leg for can be easily surpassed in a couple levels if you keep your eyes open.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dracillion</div><div class="date">02-21-2005, 11:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's a good build.  Only thing I would maybe change is swapping 5 Anticipation for 5 improved shield block.  When your tanking in a group or raid, you'll almost always use a shield, and if you have to have one or the other I'd rather have 5% more chance to block with my shield then 10 extra in defense.  (both would be good if you can swing the talents)  But if you're soloing a lot and don't plan on grouping until later etc. maybe Anticipation may be better for you.  Kind of a judgement call.<br />
<br />
Also agree with the don't buy gear thing.  I think I bought one piece of gear up to level 60.  Make/quest/do instances for gear.  For general strats, sunder armor is your friend, it stacks even if the icon doesn't multiply, use it as much as you can.  Not everything has to be max sundered, but I would at least throw it on once or twice if a mob is equal to your level or a bit higher.  (even a level lower)  Rend is great, as is demo shout, and always keep your battle shout up and your weapons sharpened/weighted.  Then throw in your choice of dps abilities, heroic, slam, MS, etc.  Also get/keep first aid as high as you can, its invalueable for eliminating down time in between fights.  Good luck and have fun!</div></div><hr />
