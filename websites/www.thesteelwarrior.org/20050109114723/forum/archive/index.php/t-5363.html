<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khaid</div><div class="date">01-24-2004, 11:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So now that we've had Incite for a while I've noticed it's not as effective as I first thought.. I wonder if anyone else feels this way?<br />
<br />
I *still* rely on procs to get my aggro if I have 3-4 taunt failures in a row, Incite, in my experience, is only useful for KEEPING aggro, not getting it. What is &quot;snap&quot; aggro supposed to be anyway, I could have sworn I heard a dev use that word talking about our new abilities. Maybe it means your fingers will snap after mashing the taunt button in frustration after watching it fail 3-6 times in a row. <br />
<br />
It's HILARIOUS that the defense of not letting incite grab aggro is that it would trivialize the game. Exactly how much more trivial could the game get? I routinely group with a ranger/beastlord, and he can grab and keep aggro very very easily (flamelick for ranger, ac/stat debuff bsts have) while the shaman is trying to slow, while I can not.. even after a succesful taunt and then incite, if the shaman casts slow again I lose aggro. <br />
<br />
The worst part of all of it, is it doesn't matter if the beastlord or ranger tanks, I may tank a little better than the ranger, and hopefully quite a bit better than the beastlord but regardless of who is tanking our healer (shaman or druid) never runs out of mana.<br />
<br />
Why can't a level 63 warrior ability, on a TIMER, that takes 9% of my endurance generate the same aggro as a LEVEL NINE Ranger spell that costs TEN MANA. It would trivialize the game you say? I'll remember that the next time the shaman tanks an add, or I need to go AFK and the beastlord plays tank. <br />
<br />
But it's all ok, cause if I shell out 30 bucks I can get AA's to make me proc more, woooooooooooo.<br />
<br />
I miss you, Verant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Karlorr</div><div class="date">01-24-2004, 12:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hate generated by low level spells is something that I have been railing against for years now. It is just ridiculous to me that level 65 pallies are running around out taunting equal level warriors with a level 9 spell. If SOE wants paladins to have snap aggro, fine so be it. But at least make it be a level appropriate spell with the mana cost justifying the power.<br />
<br />
I agree with what you have seen, and in my experience the most effective way to use incite/provoke etc is to use it to pull to get way on top of the hate list by a good margin. If I am pulling, and using provoke to do so, there is very little ping pong of aggro. If someone else pulls, and we tag via provoke, it still works but not as well. If I use an arrow to pull, and hold provoke in reserve until I &quot;need&quot; it to taunt off an overnuking caster.. success is by no means gauranteed.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, if the knight niche is going to be snap aggro that's fine. I don't agree with it, just coming to grips with what seems to be the new &quot;vision&quot;. Just make it have some mana cost associated with it that is appropriate .<br />
<br />
p.s.- Oh and im not necessarily calling for a nerf, but beastlords tank way too well, better in fact than either of their parent classes<br />
<br />
edit: changed wording so obtuse assholes can understand</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Banuk</div><div class="date">01-24-2004, 12:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">one of their parent classes? holy shit, you mean they tank better then shm? omfg noway! and if they are in an entirely ranged group, they can just have their pet tank to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Karlorr</div><div class="date">01-24-2004, 01:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I meant monk and you know it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">01-24-2004, 01:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It just seems to me that all some of you need to do is to refine your tactics using the skill AND get the asshats to stop toying with you.<br />
<br />
What I mean is ...<br />
<br />
REFINED TACTICS, as Karlorr points out, he has had different success with different tactics.<br />
<br />
&quot;and in my experience the most effective way to use incite/provoke etc is to use it to pull to get way on top of the hate list by a good margin. If I am pulling, and using provoke to do so, there is very little ping pong of aggro. If someone else pulls, and we tag via provoke, it still works but not as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
So find what works best.<br />
<br />
Deal with the ASSHATS, means, if you're in a group and you are designated as the tank, then a hybrid really shouldn't be STEALING aggro from you. Especially a Ranger or a Shadowknight. Both classes can drop aggro pretty effectively. It's STILL the job of people you play with to manage their aggro. Even SK tanks would have a hard time holding aggro over a slow-blind-debuff happy beastlord or a snare-happy ranger.<br />

<br />
Incite is used for *getting* agro.  Youre supposed to use it as the mob is incoming, not click it later on.<br />
<br />
We've never had a problem with keeping agro since EB weapons were introduced (and then subsequently amde available to very single warrior in the game via Droga revamp and LDoN augs).<br />
<br />
Seriously.. if you dont think Incite is powerful, I submit you're using it wrong....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raaj</div><div class="date">01-24-2004, 03:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Incite works great after a successful taunt, it'll give you a quick jump start ahead of everyone else. Then you should be able to stay ahead until it's up again, and get another boost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">deliciouspk</div><div class="date">01-24-2004, 09:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My wife pretty much quit her warrior and is playing an SK now.  She likes it a lot better.  She does more damage, taunts without fail and has all kinds of versatility.  I taught her how to keep 3 mobs on her at the same time while the rest of the group did their thing, she loved it.<br />
<br />
Oh ya, incite is great.  I don't see how anybody could complain about the ability... wtf.  All you have to do is flip the coin over and over untill taunt succeeds and then you can use incite to give yourself a slight edge in aggro.  Who could ask for more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">01-24-2004, 10:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">N/T<br />

Sorry I posted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">01-25-2004, 12:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I heard if you exploit the game mechanism it's a lot easier to play this game.  It's like why would people ever XP honestly when you can do some bugged charm thing in Tactics?  Why would you ever use REAL spells to get aggro when Fear generates more aggro than any other spell in the game for basically no mana cost?  People who play the game by the rules must be dumb or something when you can just exploit level 9/15 spells that produces an inordinate amount of aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khaid</div><div class="date">01-25-2004, 09:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok this was too long. My point is I thought Incite was going to give us the same ability every hybrid in the game currently has, once every 30 seconds for a substantial endurance cost. <br />
<br />
I do not see the problem with that? Unless they plan on nerfing all these spells that some might call exploits, which they have had a LONG time to do, and the only ones that got nerfed have just been replaced by another low level/mana spell. (fear / flamelick)<br />
<br />
People were saying wait for the opening system, this is just the first step... well where is that opening system now? It's probably a dead idea, and I'm glad, because the game wasn't designed for that type of play and I am not convinced it would have turned out well for us at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khaid</div><div class="date">01-25-2004, 10:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the problem is the game has been this way since release, but back then you would have *never* said &quot;let the ranger tank, it won't matter anyway&quot;. I used to play a shaman back then, and trying to keep any hybrid alive with the old heals was horrible. <br />
<br />
Hell, we used to have a shaman/druid/ranger group and we actually decided it was more efficient to have dru/shm DoT and root the mob while the ranger stayed the hell away because his melee damage wasn't worth the mana. <br />
<br />
Compare that to todays EQ, obviously things have changed A LOT except now it's no longer a bad thing for the ranger to get aggro in most cases, but those old spells are still the same hate. <br />
<br />
Something needs to be done, to them or to us. If you feel incite is fine and have your anger aug'd BoC that's fine and good for you, I have a hard time believing I'm the only warrior who doesn't think we are &quot;finished&quot; yet and I don't think we should have to buy expansions just to be viable. <br />
<br />
I don't think they want to upset the majority of players by making the game a challenge again, and that's too bad. But if they're going to keep things this way I'd like to see my abilities to get a mobs attention on par with any other tank (or non-tank as the case may be).<br />
<br />
Well I edited one long post, then created another.. wtg me!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Karlorr</div><div class="date">01-25-2004, 10:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with you Kaid, adding provoke for us is a great first step. But as long as we are tied to a timer, and aggro can be bought for 10 mana there are still issues to be addressed.<br />
<br />
Kudos for SOE for at least attempting to fix the problem, but they only did half the work.  At this point, I think knights should at least SEE a dip in their mana pool when they grab aggro. There should be some sort of choice involved. Do I heal the group or stun? Do I snare or generate hate? As it stand right now, knights can cast any spell they want rapid fire, while never missing a swing.<br />
<br />
Personally I am glad to see hybrids be worthwhile after all this time. I watched many of my friends suffer while people laughed at their attempts to get a group. I don't think they should be nerfed into the kunark era, I just think that there is no trade off choice on them where there should be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smohg</div><div class="date">01-25-2004, 10:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I think the new skills are just fine - I can get aggro off a shaman or enchanter when they slow. And we have always been better at taking damage - add to that another bonus and I got no complaints.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goradain</div><div class="date">01-26-2004, 01:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just curious, but what does Droga have to do with EB?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aldarion_Shard</div><div class="date">01-26-2004, 01:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Droga?<br />
<br />
While not technically EB, it put near-EB caliber agro weapons in the hands of every warrior who wanted them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Colcannon</div><div class="date">02-21-2004, 10:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some have said incite works well when the MOB is incoming.  Others say it works well when you already have agro.  Could it be that it works best when in line of sight?  That incite is wasted or reduced in effect if the MOB can't see you?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LastLizard</div><div class="date">02-21-2004, 12:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">..our works really bad out of melee range. Proximity aggro?<br />
<br />
Arrow + Taunt + Incite + Postman stick (why did the GSoT  have to look like some fuzzy caster stick?) .. we never had it so easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wilhelmm_Lanys</div><div class="date">02-21-2004, 02:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anyone who is complaining about incite is not using it properly. Incite works BEST right after a successful taunt. Just hit attack/kick/disarm on inc, once you see the slow message, hit taunt, then incite. you have lock-down agro from then on since you're automatically 401 hate above everyone else. If you'rte gonna complain about something, it should be the success rate on taunt, which I am not sure is actually 60% many have advertised.</div></div><hr />
