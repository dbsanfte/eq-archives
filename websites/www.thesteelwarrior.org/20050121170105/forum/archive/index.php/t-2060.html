<br />
Dear God, you made many, many people warriors. I realize, of course, that<br />
it's no great shame to be a warrior... but it's no great honor, either. So what would have<br />
been the difference if I had... good agro?<br />
<br />
If I were an agro warrior,<br />
Daidle deedle daidle<br />
Daidle daidle deedle daidle dum<br />
All day long I'd biddy-biddy-bum<br />
If I were a agro warrior.<br />
I wouldn't have to work hard,<br />
Daidle deedle daidle<br />
Daidle daidle deedle daidle dum<br />
If I was biddy-biddy agro,<br />
Daidle deedle daidle daidle warrior.<br />
<br />
I'd taunt a big mobs with hit points by the thousand,<br />
Right in the middle of the group,<br />
A slow on inc with shaman not really worring.<br />
There would be one long taunt button,<br />
And an even shorter AE taunt,<br />
And one more marco button, just for show.<br />
<br />
I'd fill my inventory with loots and plats and gold<br />
And dyes for the guid to see and hear,<br />
Squinting as hard as they can,<br />
And each loud &quot;pa-pa-geeee! pa-pa-gaack! pa-pa-geeee! pa-pa-gaack!&quot;<br />
Would land like a trumpet on the ear,<br />
As if to say, &quot;Here taunts an agro warrior.&quot;<br />
Oy!<br />
<br />
If I were an agro warrior,<br />
Daidle deedle daidle<br />
Daidle daidle deedle daidle dum<br />
All day long I'd biddy-biddy-bum<br />
If I were an agro warrior.<br />
I wouldn't have to work hard,<br />
Daidle deedle daidle<br />
Daidle daidle deedle daidle dum<br />
If I were a biddy-biddy agro,<br />
Daidle deedle daidle daidle warrior.<br />
<br />
I see my cleric, my Golde, looking like a agro warriors cleric,<br />
With a proper double pet,<br />
Nuking mobs to her heart's delight.<br />
I see her putting on airs and strutting like a peacock,<br />
Oy! What a happy mood she's in,<br />
Casting at the mobs day and night.<br />
<br />
The most important men on the server will come to fawn on me--<br />
They will ask me to advise them,<br />
Like a Solomon the Wise--<br />
&quot;If you please, Reb Tevye?&quot;--<br />
&quot;Pardon me, Reb Tevye?&quot;--<br />
Causing agro that would cross a paladin's eyes--<br />
(chanting) Ya va voy, ya va voy voy vum...<br />
And it won't make one bit of difference<br />
If I answer right or wrong--<br />
When you're agro,  they think you really know.<br />
<br />
If I were agro, I'd have the time that I lack<br />
To sit in the planes and AA,<br />
And maybe have a seat in the Plane of Time,<br />
And I'd agro the XP mobs, with them ignoring the holy men<br />
Seven hours every day--<br />
That would be the sweetest thing of all...<br />
Oy!<br />
<br />
If I were a agro warrior,<br />
Daidle deedle daidle<br />
Daidle daidle deedle daidle dum<br />
All day long I'd biddy-biddy-bum<br />
If I were a agro warrior.<br />
I wouldn't have to work hard,<br />
Daidle deedle daidle<br />
Daidle daidle deedle daidle dum<br />
Lord who made the lion and the lamb,<br />
You decreed I should be what I am--<br />
Would it spoil some vast, eternal plan,<br />
If I were an agro warrior?</div></div><hr />
