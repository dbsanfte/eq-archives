<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dallatar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I heard that having Epic 1.0 gives you a choice of another title (at least other classes said it). Which title is is?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Graiden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I was wondering the same thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Madagascar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Champion</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm the only one I know with the ability to be one....<br />
<br />
Dirge is on my list, and I saw an Iksaar warrior with the title earlier.  Thought maybe it was for evil races, but looks like you a barbie?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I am Tribuneral barb and I have dirge too.<br />
<br />
Champion means epic, aye? Hmm. At 125 AA I have about 10 choices and I have no tradeskills. <br />
<br />
Baroness, Champion, Dirge, Duchess, Lady, Marauder, Mistress, Oppressor and Veteran.<br />
<br />
How how did I get both rogue and pally titles?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Heh they are mostly generic titles. Turns out the only speical one I have is for epic (champoin). Once you have 24 in arch you can get Overlord, Warlord, Myrmidon and...gah I forget the last. <br />
<br />
Check the OoW PDF (or read me). SOE has it posted somewhere.<br />
<br />
Swashbuckler is the rogue epic title. My 1 AA, 54th rogue has that one.</div></div><hr />

I was going around as Master Potter for awhile but I got bored so I switched to Dirge since everyone seems to have chosen Oppressor, and I wanted to be different.</div></div><hr />

Never heard of Titles for having Epic.<br />
And how do you change your title ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
and the choices available to me are<br />
<br />

Veteran</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">That whole list you have there is old Elfried.</div></div><hr />

Champion is the title for having Epic 1.0</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I only have Baron, Vet, and Marshall available to me.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Dallatar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">The reason I asked is because although I have had my epic for years, I don't have the Champion title available to me.<br />
<br />
Yes, I turned in my old epic for the new auggable swords. I also have the old style one-handers as well.<br />
<br />
I think they are still having issues with custom titles.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Dallatar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Any of you without epic have Opressor as an option? <br />
<br />
I have the Oppressor title, and have epic. A guildie of mine who does not have epic has the title as well.<br />
<br />
I saw a Monk last night running around with the Oppressor title...</div></div><hr />

None of my characters have anything other than their 3 titles + epic titles to choose from.  So that's good, we'll be able to tell who the sellouts are immediately :)<br />
<br />
Oppressor would be cool, but I'll be damned if I'm buying another expansion just for that.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">In all reality, WHY didn't they add new titles for something other than archetype and class AA's? Wheres the title for having PoP, GoD, or OOW AA's? I guess it's cool that you can pick but it seems like for so little effort they could have made it a lot cooler.<br />
<br />
Or a new title for &gt;100 total aa's, &gt;200 total aa's, etc?<br />
<br />
Why not a title for those with all defensive AAs, or maxed flurry, or...?<br />
<br />
I guess I was really hoping for something new that would seperate the truly uber from those who just bought cf3, ramp, ambidex, and flurry to get their marshaall at 48 aa's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I have epic 1.0 and Champion does not appear.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">&quot;the truly uber&quot;?   haha<br />

It would be nice to see some higher AA titles tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Ok fine, not &quot;truly uber&quot; but rather &quot;lots of aa&quot; but in either case, you get my point :)<br />

<br />
How about &quot;Apparantly no job?&quot;<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I play EQ a lot, and am the last person to be making fun of geeks that play the game a lot..but seriously, some people with like 7 or 800 AA's are clearly living off an inheritance or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Yeah, well, I'm really just looking for an excuse to buy rampage for my marshall title, never mind me.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Would be nice if I did not have to get more points in class aa's to get my title. With OoW, I could easily go 300+ AA with qualifying for more titles. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">MightyTalk Shikarii<br />

After I wage and win the Coldain Ring War, I'm going to grind the remaning class AA's and annoint myself with &quot;Marshall&quot; or &quot;Overlord&quot;<br />
<br />
Honestly, though, I expect that in a month this bit of candy will have lost its sweetness, and I'll be running around title-less.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you keep your epic in 2h format to save space in inventory like I do, or equipped it doesnt read as an &quot;Epic&quot; for the Champion title.  I investigated this when I made my epic into dual wield and zoned, Champion was available, I equipped my normal weapons than and logged off, but before logging made the dual wielders into a 2h to save space once again now that I had my title.  Upon logging back on, my title was gone, apparently you can only have your Champion title if you keep your epics in dual wield format in your inventory, equipped, or banked, if you make it into Jagged blade of war, its read as not having an epic, so no title.  Hope that explains a bit more, so just keep them in Dual format and you should be good.</div></div><hr />

I wish they could have come up with something more feminine sounding.  Oppressor or Marshall or Dirge or whatever else just doesn't fit a female.  Guess I'm sticking with Marshall for now /sigh.</div></div><hr />
