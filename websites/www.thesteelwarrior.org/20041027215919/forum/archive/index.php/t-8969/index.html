<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Danylon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone else feel the new zones are way to easy the single grp exp mobs are no challenge at all so far,at least as far as Proving Grounds.<br />
<br />
Was expecting alot harder mobs and more fun/risk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kilzalot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yea I think it's way too easy.  Like to get to MPG, you have to pass Hulcor*... bastard doesn't even see invis!  He should be like &quot;the guardian&quot; of MPG.  As in, you need to kill him to get to the zone.  Just little things like that.  Still very early to tell tho.  So far I haven't seen much that was all that challenging.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Seraz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">seeing as this is posted in Overlords Sanctuary i bet most of you are pretty &quot;UBER&quot; but i think SoE has made this slightly easier for casuals, non raiders or pre-time players... GoD was for the &quot;UBER&quot; , OoW should be easier for everyone to enjoy and the idea of no flags is good.. I'm sure you'll find something hard to kill/raid soon enough...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>aspit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">personally i find it funny that a 70 zone is easier than a 65 zone, and yes proving grounds mobs are easier than kod taz mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>KirasTrueheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Mobs in Proving Grounds don't hit as hard as KT mobs, but they still have about the same incomming DPS as KT trash.  Trash in MPG had around 250 - 300 dps against me.  I guess MPG mobs quad more often.  They are definately more accurate (greater than 60% for MPG mobs compared to less than 50% for KT mobs).<br />
<br />
Of course, mobs in MPG are like level 70, compared to KT mobs being mostly 64 - 67.  I expect that a level 70 in MPG would have a much easier time than a level 65 in KT, given the same equipment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bulbog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Didn't hulcor see invis in the beta?  I remember being plowed by him exploring on a bard.  Also I'm just wondering how much raid content there is in the expansion to high end guilds.  I suppose the citadel of whatever(keyed zone) is probably packed with stuff though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dintorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">This is clearly shaping up to be the anti-GoD expansion, which is OK with me.  As a 6k/1500/79 I don't really enjoy GoD all that much, so I'm finding OoW to be a bit of a pleasant surprise.<br />
<br />
Besides, if it's too easy you can always do what our Guild Leader does when he tanks trivial content ... strip down to your boxer shorts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Warfust</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">That, and have already seen a few trials that will unlock named to kill.  Should be interesting to learn the progressiosn here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sargasso</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yeah so far at least in WoS and MPG the mobs are easier to tank...which quite honestly isn't such a bad thing...they do have more HP...and SoE really did have to make some of this content tankable by non raider tanks.  From what I've seen so far this might be the best balanced expansion in quite some time as far as having stuff for raiders and casuals.<br />
<br />
I am a raider but I don't begrudge the casuals their piece of the pie and they need stuff to fight post level 65 to.<br />
<br />
This expansion is SWEET so far!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The thing you have to remember is your level of gear though too. Stuff in PG isn't that tough for a time+ Geared tank, but if you've tried the trials they're designed around level 70 + high end gear, and are pretty fun too. Riftseekers is also level 69 restricted, and a bit more difficult.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Khumak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I agree.  Proving Grounds is way too easy.  It's moderately annoying to get to though compared to KT, especially if you're doing CR.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Callon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Riftseekers is a zone?  I know it's a faction that we seem to start as max on the high end with.<br />
<br />
A zone list and brief commentary on the zone would be a great thing to have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Binnamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">This is how I'm thinking it's going to play out.<br />
<br />
I'm thinking that proving grounds is going to be the SSRA of OoW, with Citadel being the VT.  <br />
<br />
There really wasn't much raiding content before SSRA in Luclin, but SSRA and VT were jam packed with stuff to do. <br />
<br />
That's what I'm  leaning torwards,  it's only an idea.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh and I think Riftseekers is a zone off of Proving grounds.  I'm not 69 yet so I havn't explored.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Dracillion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">After all I had heard I was really suprised yesterday when I finally got to xp in WoS and PG.  I was like...are thes mobs hitting me?  Maybe I'm just used to the steriod infused GoD mobs with 9000 attack.  I mean the OOW mobs did hit...okay, and some had nasty procs, but it was no where near what KT and Ikknz mobs do.  I guess I expected OOW mobs to hit harder than GoD mobs, and for the most part the ones I've encountered so far, even the red con ones, don't.  But I guess what folks said is true, that its a bit more geared towards non-raiding/casual folks.  Which is cool too.  Everyone should be able to have fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">GoD mobs are, in my opinion, a bit over the top.  Admittingly, I only have one piece of Time gear at the time that I write this, but I'm still almost 11k hp and 2300ac, which isn't too bad I guess.  <br />
<br />
Much of the &quot;over the top&quot; that I have my grudge feelings about has to do with the Chaos Claws proc.  It's not that a ~650dd proc is really all that mind blowing (it's not), but even after the retuning, I find some mobs still have ridiculous procrates.  I began tanking a Kyv once in Tipt and he proc'd 3x in a single round of combat.  Thank god I had Seasons, Tribunal, and Ferocity on, as I resisted all three of them.  Ra`tuks and Ukuns have a relatively moderate procrate, but Kyvs and Nocs are a completely different story.  Ever charm a Noc in Tipt/Vxed?  How often do you see it proc Chaos Claws?  They proc at least 5-10x a fight, if not more sometimes, and these are freaking 20 second fights at best!  <br />
<br />
Now enter Ikkinz where mobs hit even harder, AND come 60% hasted!  Doesn't a bell ring in your head when you consider the intial damage of an incoming Kyv is close to 2000dps?  Not only is that stupid, but it's fucking crazy.  <br />
<br />
I tanked a red con named Kyv in KT once.  Even after Furious and Defensive, he put out 1087dps to me.  This wasn't a 15 second fight either, as it took my group over a minute to kill this thing, so the sample size isn't totally bogus.  Needless to say, had it not been for the Tacvi keyed cleric and me playing my own cleric as backup, I would have never lived to tell the story.  Come on now, is it really that necessary to make mobs that fucking asinine?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Frostpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Ive got groups in Proving grounds twice now, and I think its great.  My gear is much worse than a lot of the above posters though, so for me its  challenging. Anyway, nice addition as far as im concerned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Mob difficulty aside from some that are bugging out is fine in the 1/2/3 zone connected areas. So what if a time geared+ tank can easily handle it? Want a harder experience go past these so called 'too easy nub xp zones'. It's a nice change of pace from requiring all xp mobs to be a gay dps fests like GoD was pushing for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kharan_Zechts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I think MPG is fine just the way it is. The mobs dont hit as hard as KT mobs but they hit more often, so its basicly the same. Those of you that say MPG is too easy do some grouping in there and youll see when you get adds its not so easy anymore. Level 65 mezzes do not work on them and there isnt much room to kite, esp when you get the northern area where the mobs are more condensed. I watched a group and a half of level 70's repeatledy wipe trying to move to the northern section of the zone due to adds and pulling mistakes.<br />
<br />
The XP is good here and the the chances for spells/discs makes it my primary choice for leveling and aa grinding.<br />
<br />
<br />
The XP in the other zones isnt all that great. They are not going to be populated as much because of this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kaldanm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I'm not EP flagged yet but I have some nice Gear (full buffed to 9600 - 9700).<br />
<br />
So Far I found the OoW trash fun to tank. It remind me a bit of Kunark trash where things were not that dangerous and as a warrior every single enemy was not able to kill you in a blink like some stuff can in GoD.<br />
<br />
However I agree, OoW lack one or two of those zone I should fear to zone because it's too dangerous for a under 10k warrior like me, like ToV was when I was 52 : tried it, got owned, then I got back to upgrade my gear and came back at 55 to do better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Oowar raises the question of where the AC cap went in this expansion.<br />
<br />
Did it go up? doesn't seem likely, stuff doesn't hit hard.<br />
<br />
Did it go down? Possible, things don't hit hard to so high AC could really trivialize it further.<br />
<br />
Did it stay the same? Also quite possible.<br />
<br />
The more I play, the more I think OoWar and GoD DID come out in the wrong order.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>GraniteMG</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I think the expansion is nice in its current incarnation so far. It gives the casuals somethings to do in new areas as well, has a lot to offer different people in the way of entertainment.<br />
<br />
From a business standpoint it was a smart move, it keeps the majority of the playerbase happy, and makes it so the next expansion they come out with can be more high end, offer some new aa's, and people will be happy because they have Planes, OoW and GoD zones all still useful places to visit at level 70 even if they can't do everything in whatever expansion comes next.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Naubi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">If you're worried about OoW not being tough enough to make a warrior tank worthwhile then it helps to realise that just raising the dps and ability to one round you doesnt have to be the only way to favour a warrior tank. Take this to the extreme and a ranger with WS is your best tank.<br />
<br />
Upping the hp a mob has can make it a warrior mob too. <br />
E.g. cleric was casting on fumes healing me on Dragorn Champion because even tho it had no chance of killing me in split seconds (like a GoD named) it had so many hp that mana was falling faster than its hp. Sure add in another healer and we could have kept up np, but then that's less dps, and so on.</div></div><hr />

From what I have seen and read it looks like SOE has opted to use effects to accomplish the ass whooping rather than dps. I can help but laugh when reading about some of the ae's in the expansion. I watched 3 grps of Txevu flagged guys go down to a mob cause they ran out of mana in no time due to drainage. I am sure they will find a way to beat some of these mobs (and those that FD/memblur which is kind of interesting too) but if you havent found something that can kick your ass you havent looked hard enough :)<br />
<br />
And as a boxer I am glad as hell that see invis has become rationale again!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I tanked some stuff in OoW today.  I found it a nice, fun change from being absolutely obbliterated by GoD mobs.  Mobs seem to hit pretty fast initially, but once slowed they're fine.  Procs and DDs weren't quite near Deathtouch levels like those of GoD either. :)<br />
<br />
Now, the named are particularly interesting.  I shouldn't say their dps is really all that high, but on the same token, they're still pretty dangerous.  They hit *hard*, but they don't hit very fast.  The named I tanked was some weird looking mofo in WoS.  He kind of reminded me of a grasshopper I guess.  He hits for about 2600s or so outside of Defensive and 1500s inside Defensive disc.  He also rampaged!  Weee.  <br />
<br />
Aside from mobs, the zones look absolutely gorgious, though everyone in my group complained that they lagged like a motherfucker.  I think the zones pump out some major texture memory usage, and that's an idea I had that I'll probably prove later on Sunday, or possibly Monday.  They didn't lag a single bit on my 256mb Geforce 6800 GT.   In fact, none of the zones even freaking flinched.  The thing is though, EQ really isn't a serious video card hungry game (I bought the card for Doom3, BF1942, and Half-Life2 :) ).  I've played on a multitude of cards and the game pretty much plays the same.  But everone in my group either had a 64 or 128mb card.  I'll be firing up the OoW zones on my secondary machine (Radeon9700 Pro 128mb) and seeing how they play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Callon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">The devs have a problem designing new grind zones because they've created such a massive gear gap between high end raiders and everyone else.  It's especially felt on your tank.  Compare the better tanks who don't even have elem access yet to tanks with elem, time, and even Qvic+ gear.  It's night and day.  If you make the zone so the non high end raider has a prayer of tanking it, then it's easy for the high end raid tank.  <br />
<br />
So you either design new grind zones so those not in high end raiding can tank it, in which case the raiders are annoyed that it's so easy, or you make the zones so that only the high end tank can do it, then everyone else is mad.  That was what much of GoD was like, especially pre mob ATK nerfs.  <br />
<br />
Or... you need a lot more zones because you can't just design grind zones for L65-70.  You have to have separate stuff for high end raid tanks who get toward L70 and all the other L70 tanks.  Not to mention the fact that a L70 with 50 AA needs somewhere he can get reasonable exp, as does the one with 500 AA.  <br />
<br />
That's EQ today.  Blame the devs who've created this huge gap between people of the same level and have to deal with it now.</div></div><hr />

This will depend upon the qualityof the armor available to groups/guilds that maybe don't make it to the flagged zone.   Most of what I have seen from MPG/WoS appears to be elemental quality.  And the named single group mobs are not that difficult.. especially with random pickup groups killing them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Callon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">hmm... certainly haven't seen anything in WoS that's elem quality in terms of both AC and hit points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">The 1-2 group loot in WoS certainly exceeds the quality of the 1-2 group loot in the elementals.<br />
<br />
To get loot that matches raid elemental loot, it looks like you need to do the OoW content that is of Tipt difficulty and higher.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Riftseekers is a zone? I know it's a faction that we seem to start as max on the high end with.<br />
<br />
A zone list and brief commentary on the zone would be a great thing to have.<br />
<br />
Yes, Riftseekers' Sanctum is a zone, it's off of Muramite proving Grounds, and is level limted to 69+.    <br />
<br />
As a commentary, it's the most fantastic looking zone I've ever seen in Everquest, bar none.   The mobs are harder than MPG mobs, and there's a lot of em, and they're fairly high level (71+).   The gear dropping there is really nice as well.<br />
<br />
Overall, and I'm a pretty rabid raider... I have to say that Omens has been shaping up to be one of the great expansions in EQ.  Who cares that your clerics aren't sweating blood every time a mob is pulled?   Jesus, there's a difference between a challenge and overboard retarded.   The MPG trials are fun as hell, and on a number of them, failure doesn't mean &quot;wipe&quot;, but simply failure, and lockout for 2 hours.<br />
<br />
This expansion is sort of a &quot;recalibration&quot; expansion, where players are a little more evened out in terms of progression.  Certainly it makes Vex Thal pretty much obsolete, which is fine, it'll make Elementals pretty much obsolete too, which is also fine.   The thing is that it was no longer possible to sustain the &quot;Keep it challenging for the top end&quot; without making it impossible for the mid to lower ends, and frankly, the masses needed reasons to leave BoT and LDoN, and I think they've found it now.<br />
<br />
I think this will turn out to be a pretty tremendous shot in the arm for  EQ as a whole.   I'm really glad it's turning out the way it is, and isn't another &quot;let's keep everyone separate&quot; expansion.   If I want isolation and safety, I'll get an instance or go to Qvic, but I don't, I want immersion, fun, and group availability and I've found it in Omens.<br />
<br />
The WHOLE of Everquest is a much better place since Omens went live.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Callon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Agreed, Frodlin... the top end raiders may be bored with most of the grind mobs not being hard enough, but often there are named nearby too that my group might consider a 2-3 group target, but a group of high end raiders do with 1 group as a challenge while they're grinding.  There are of course still raids available for that high end challenge and I assume the PG trials are pretty tough single group content.<br />
<br />
Are people 1 grouping in Riftseekers?  Initially we were hearing it was mainly a raid zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Shabba</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Frodlin you say that Omens will make VT and maybe EPs 'obsolete'.  I see that there are many very nice loots dropping out of there, but will it compare to the volume of loot you can get in VT?  We are about to kill emp for the first time and are looking forward to it...eitherway we plan on not skipping any content and playing through it all...at least to some level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Naubi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">VT is definitely obselete... <br />
<br />
&quot;volume of loot you can get in VT&quot; - quote<br />
<br />
VT only has a high volume of loot compared to raiding old style competitive raid content... ssra/kael etc. The amount and quality of loot vs time spent in VT is a total joke compared to for example, clearing the plane of time or qvic minis. It's no longer part of any real progression.<br />
<br />
On the other hand I don't see EPs as obselete until we know where you can pick up raex level AC visible armour in OoW as part of bazaar -&gt; GoD progression. <br />
<br />
And I think OoW is great too... if we had another GoD/PoP style expansion I would be looking to server move probably since my guild is no longer able to raid high end.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">VT is still  interesting under 2 conditions :<br />
<br />
It takes less than 14 Days to completely flag your guild.<br />
You can clear VT in One raid session.<br />
<br />
While the loot isnt really &quot;monstrous&quot; the sheer quantity enables a small guild<br />
to have a really steady base of 100/100 items in a huge quantity.<br />
<br />
You cant beat 30+ 100/100 Loots in under 6 hours anywhere exept the EP/Time.<br />
<br />
PS : If you compare VT to Time Naubi you'll Time gives more Loot/Hour.<br />
But VT is still really decent.<br />
<br />
Time &gt; EP &gt; VT in Loot/Hour , but getting Time Flag (or finding EP mobs up)<br />
Is a bit harder than getting VT key (which is long thats the problem)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">I couldn't agree more Frodlin. This expansion is not only very pleasing to the eye, but also a lot of fun for uber and casual alike. I do agree that this will make VT obsolete, but only because early-GoD+LDoN+OoW will make getting in to the elems pretty easy. The sheer amount of man hours spent on getting in to VT makes it hard to justify when there are so many options on how to gear up now. Way back in the day, I was one of the people who preached that VT was an important piece of the progression puzzle when you set your sites on the elems. Today, you can gain as much if not more power from levels, AA, and gear outside VT to make the elems very viable.<br />
<br />
I do think the elems will still be a good step for any guild that is gearing up. On Terris, all of the Fire named including FRo have been up all week. I would imagine it is the same in the other elems as well. Getting in to Time will simply be a matter of getting enough people geared up and perfecting the strats. Finding the mobs up does not appear to be a problem at this time.<br />
<br />
Even PoTime will have a much shorter lifespan now. Because of the complete seperation of GoD+OoW progression from PoP, a guild can be making headway in to GoD and OoW on the way to Time. There are actually quite a few guilds that have made it to Uqua without having set foot in Time. As these guilds fill in the gaps with OoW gear, it will be more and more feasible to move in to Qvic+ without having to do Time or even too much of the elems. Once in to Qvic you can certainly gear up almost exclusively in GoD, at a faster rate than the elems or Time due to the quantity of drops in Qvic.<br />
<br />
I don't necessarily think this is a bad thing though. This will actually give guilds several paths of progression while still having the same end goal. I imagine that most up and coming guilds willtailor thier progression around what is most available on their servers. If VT is packed, then LDoN+GoD will prepare them for the elems and Time. If the elems and Time are packed, then VT+early GoD+OoW will prepare them late GoD. The people will go were others are not, which I think is a good thing for the game. People are driven by increasing their power - getting loot - and with so many viable options now for quality loot, I think there will be a lot more room for &quot;casual&quot; guilds to gear up enough to see the higher end zones much easier than ever before.</div></div><hr />

The thing is that it was no longer possible to sustain the &quot;Keep it challenging for the top end&quot; without making it impossible for the mid to lower ends, and frankly, the masses needed reasons to leave BoT and LDoN, and I think they've found it now.<br />
<br />
I think this will turn out to be a pretty tremendous shot in the arm for  EQ as a whole.   I'm really glad it's turning out the way it is, and isn't another &quot;let's keep everyone separate&quot; expansion.   If I want isolation and safety, I'll get an instance or go to Qvic, but I don't, I want immersion, fun, and group availability and I've found it in Omens.<br />
<br />
The WHOLE of Everquest is a much better place since Omens went live.<br />

I agree with what you are saying, but have one serious concern about OoW.  Simply put, there does not seem to be enough zones for everyone.  What I mean is that on Luclin, we are seeing 40 + people in NC, 40 + people in MPG, and 100 + at times in WoS.  The zones are packed!   Especially for people without EP flags, there is almost no place else outside OoW to level up effectivly to 70.  Are there enough instinced zones in OoW to help releive some of this pressure?  Is there plans to make level 70 LDoN's?  Is SoE considering revamping some older, underused zones to appeal to level 70's?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Faifai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">:cool:  well I do agree that PG is easy compare to KT and packed as hell...but if you are game, try to zone into the new zone in PG &quot;Rifxxxxxx Scantrum&quot; or something like that, the zone is freaking nice and have little players as I believe that its a raiding zone....yellow con mob to a 70 and cast freezing wind (STUNT) and its no joke lol almost 1 min stunt...all in all OOW is still a very nice expansion so far.... :)  <br />
and one last thing....Good work on OoW SoE hehehehe<br />
<br />
Failo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>GraniteMG</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">The expansion is awesome, my only complaint is &quot;Clumping the move&quot;. The crowdedness -could- just be a new expansion thing, but that's not the way people work, they move to where the masses move and these crowds will probably be around for some time. <br />
<br />
Just an idea, but I think they should:<br />
<br />
1. Ever-so-slightly up the exp modifier from elementals<br />
2. Bump the expierence modifier from PoP zones to make pretty much all of them useful. (Give them all a little bump in expierence, again, nothing drastic, with a slightly larger bump to zones rarely used like Plane of Torment, Crypt of Decay, etc)<br />
3. Go back to Luclin and take 3-4 zones and up the expierence modifiers on them some more. They upped the exp modifier on them once already, but the hp's of the mobs make it so people still don't go there much. Grieg, Ssra, Acrylia Caverns, and Akheva Ruins would be plenty.<br />
<br />
I know it looks like I'm almost asking for a retroactive global exp mod increase, but with 1 patch they would spread people out more. It wouldn't be putting these places out of line, but would be putting them into the just usable areas. <br />
<br />
Put a few zones in line to get some small revamps (Kael Drakkael, Skyshrine, Temple of Veeshan, and a big revamp for Sleeper's Tomb)<br />
<br />
Anyway, just an idea, OoW and GoD are still going to be attractive for sure, making some other areas a bit more appealing just seemed like a natural counter-balance to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Callon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">A small exp modifier increase won't make up for the fact that with the exception of elems, all the older zones you mentioned are mostly under L65 mobs.  At L70, you need to be killing mainly 65+ mobs to get the approximately 100% exp bonus for mobs within 5 levels of you.  There aren't enough grind zones for that.<br />

I thought PG had some single group instanced trials.  Or are they trials that are part of PG?<br />
<br />
Ruined City of Dranik has some expeditions that are probably pretty good exp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Trials are instanced but I don't know about them being a good source of xp though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They aint bad.  Roughly the same as the PG exp anyways.  Might be a lil faster depending on your group tho.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">ruined city of dranik is almost always empty on bertoxx and is pretty decent xp and has quite a few nameds. check out my magelo and look at my ring of the serpent or whatever its called. it dropped off a trash mob in ruined city of dranik.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Ichkabibel2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">another important thing to realize that makes oow quite easy is that necromancers can mind wrack EVERY SINGLE mob there... even ones i KNOW are pure melee (like rogue mobs that backstab)  so generally i make caster heavy groups with a necro and plow through with ease... i assume this will be nerfed eventually though</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">If you're looking for good exp to 70 that's away from the crowds, Vxed and Tipt are the place to be.  Can't farm OoW spells there obviously, but it's very good exp with a solid group and you have it all to yourself.<br />
<br />
Once a lot of people hit 70 and get their spells the OoW zones will calm down I'm sure.  I think WoS and MPG are going to be popular zones for a long time though.  We have it so good on test hehe.  We think we are oppressed if there are 2 other groups in WoS when we get there, and I've never been in MPG when we didn't have it all to ourselves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Ichkabibel2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">ruined city of dranik is superb exp and loot... with an identical group we were getting better xp in dranik compared to MPG, because mobs have much less hp and you can stay in one 100% safe spot and pull from all over (4-5 named PHs depending on group).  difficulty of trash mobs is very slightly harder than wos (which is to say, easy as hell) and the named only hit for like 900 and drop up to greater muramite runes<br />
the only downside is MPG's loot kicks its ass, but its all either droppable or attunable so still great money</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Magumas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">OoW.. Way to go SOE. About time they did something.  Haven't had this much fun in single groups since back when Kunark came out..  They finally did something for the average casual player where you can get decent drops in single group.</div></div><hr />
