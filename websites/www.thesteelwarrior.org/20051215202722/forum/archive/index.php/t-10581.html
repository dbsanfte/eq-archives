Its been the source of much hub bub cause some folks got suspended donig what most of us would consider normal (summon pulling ala CoH but with a warlock).  So in their game of tit for tat, Conquest has posted all their info on Molten Core:<br />

<br />
Enjoy!<br />
<br />
p.s. off topic but that GM Maleki needs to stfu on the WoW fourms already, imo.</div></div><hr />

Nothing like knowing there is limited end game content--because end game is supposed to be PVP (which is coming soon--beinging to think Vivendi needs a candy-gram from Mongo....) and Blizzard can't get along with the raid guilds.</div></div><hr />

oh, it is?<br />
<br />
I've heard other players say that, but I've never seen anything from Blizz that said anything about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">02-09-2005, 09:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yup. The battlegrounds have a lot of content attached to them as I understand. PVP armor sets, mounts, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">02-09-2005, 09:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yea thats the battlegrounds, the first part of game content they are releasing before a new expansion.  They're also adding acouple of raid encounters plus another entire new raiding zone after that.<br />
<br />
I've never heard it said that the Battlegrounds are the end game of WoW.  More like an additional piece to the end game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dracillion</div><div class="date">02-09-2005, 10:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its both.  Blizz has said that end game content, both PvP and PVE, will be extensive.  What this means who knows?  I'm sure battlegrounds and PvP will make up a huge part of it, but I can't see them not including more PVE raid type stuff.</div></div><hr />

I did many times... actually I heard battlegrounds and hero classes were the end all be all of WoW in its current futur.</div></div><hr />

Where?</div></div><hr />

<br />
out of memory, battleground were early spoke to be a fun alternative to PvE/Quest grind. then Hero classes apeared to be the end all be all hard and long quest for the fewer uberer of the uberer PC. Then battleground were told to take a large place of the end game. Then hero classes were spoke to be reachable (at least the beginning of it) from most of PC. Then battlegrounds were spoked to be the most important aspect of end game. Then both hero classes and battleground were shuddeled to an unknown date. then talent eappeared and hero classes took back their place of harder end game. that it wasn't meant to be easy to get as talent (that give little impact on gameplay - like a flavored class), but that hero classes were a complete shift that would give uncomparable gameplay. then raid instances and zones were lauched little by little. then battleground were told to be launched later (few month after game release). then hero classes were told to be still planed but wouldn't be released before total completion that has no shuddele. then my memories are getting into the dark side...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">02-09-2005, 11:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really dont think Blizzard has figured it out what they are going to do yet.  Right now, mum's the word from them.<br />
<br />
I do hope that its about a 50/50 mix of PvE and PvP in the end game.  I love the idea of raiding a big bad boss mob with player characters protecting him (just one example).  Or realm controled dungons ala Darkness Falls in DAoC.  Still, I think the baddest of the bad gear should come out of PvE raiding, not PvP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dracillion</div><div class="date">02-09-2005, 06:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have to agree, I think its pretty open.  There is a ton of content and WoW lore (just from the games books etc.), that they haven't even touched in the game yet.  Not even saying that they will, but they have a lot of options.  We'll see!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">02-09-2005, 06:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">oh, now this is golden.  Now that Conquest has posted their heal strats, out comes the nerf bat:<br />

The Paladin spell, Blessing of Light, has been changed so that it properly scales according to the rank of the healing spell being cast. Prior to this fix, the Blessing of Light bug gave a greater-than-intended effect to lower-rank Paladin healing spells. This bug allowed Paladins to heal at a rapid rate using very little mana by only using the first ranks of Flash of Light and Holy Light. This bug has been hotfixed and is now eliminated from the game. <br />
Just like the big ass dev post on warriors after their lil protest crashed a server (even though it was talked about for a week prior to the event on Blizzards own forums).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">02-09-2005, 06:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Posting exploits/bugs that are obviously in player's favor tends to get them fixed.<br />
<br />
Though I don't really think fixing problems this way is necessarily a good idea.  It's sort of like when there were D2 BNet scams, people posted the scams in hopes that people would be aware of them, and it did.  More people are now aware of how to scam people and the # of scams actually went up for a while until everyone knows about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daeos</div><div class="date">02-10-2005, 09:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well they better get some end game content in soon, I'm sick of taking our guild through the same garbage every night because there's nothing else to raid. <br />
<br />
I know they're adding a few more zones including a Azshara raid I believe, but seriously, nothing like plowing UBRS about literally sixty times for Onyxia keys if you're on the Horde side. It's pretty silly right now, it's either MC/UBRS or Onyxia unless you want to raid one group content.<br />
<br />
Atleast battle grounds should be pretty good, I'm sure it will be entertaining for a while since the PvP encounters will have player interaction and be a bit more random.</div></div><hr />
