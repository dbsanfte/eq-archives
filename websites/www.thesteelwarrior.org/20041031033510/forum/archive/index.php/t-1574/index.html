<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Greypaws</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know these two questions have been slammed into the ground probably 10 times, but I would like a fresh perspective since things can change with patches and class balancing.<br />
<br />
A)  I use a Windblade in exp grps.  I loose aggro at times (not often), but the grp normally adjusts and we do just fine.  Been tanking in PoV/PoS and the slower normally just stands next to me when slowing so I grab aggro right back verses running to tag it.  However, in old world zones, or raiding, I use my Fleshgrinder and my Snowchipper.  Reposts are much more, but I proc. like a fool and rarely loose aggro, even with over nuking.<br />
---Question:  Should I use the 2 1hs weapons in PoP (even if I get reposted more), or should I stick to the Windblade and mash taunt and pray the group adjusts to me?<br />
<br />
B)  Shields.  I dont have a one, but just looking at a Tae Ew shield makes me think twice about why we dont use them more.  I understand the aggro thing, dont get me wrong, but I have yet to see a good shield for a warrior (tier 2-4 excluded) that can hold aggro and give the benifits our SK and Pally friends can take advantage of.  AC, resists, HP, Stam:  all are pouring out of most shields.<br />
---Question:  Do you use a shield? If you do, what?  And if you think we shouldnt, tell me why. (remember, I dont have past tier 2 access, so the No drops higher up are not an option)<br />
<br />
Just some thoughts.  My warrior does quite well for now, but moving to more difficult mobs, I want to do what is right without looking like an idiot to mister Uber_Warrior_01.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Cenyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Windblade is fine, if you only lose aggro every 1 in 5 mobs, you are doing way better than what i am used to. This is coming from a 65 cleric =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, I don't. Shields cut my aggro in half when tanking. I can't accept half the meager aggro I already have, especially when mobs need to be debuffed and slowed asap so that the group doesn't have to stop every 5 minutes. <br />
<br />
Boss encounters are different. I would only use a shield (and only a Furious Bash shield, they seem to be the only shields with decent enough stats to loose a weapon) after I am sure I have loads of aggro and no over-zealous wizard thinks he's hot stuff.<br />
<br />
General rule of thumb between most warriors: Leave the shields for the Knights.<br />
<br />
Edit: spelling</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>tarsk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Shields at the beginning of a boss is not a bad idea - You don't have to worry about anyone taking aggro from you then, (well, apart from the CH ring) and the extra AC you get can help that bumpy few seconds at the start of a fight before the CH ring gets fully settled in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">1. Windblade is pretty good if you get punishing blow....<br />
2. Shields are good, but don't spend a fortune on one unless you're in a raiding guild...a sarnak shield is good</div></div><hr />
