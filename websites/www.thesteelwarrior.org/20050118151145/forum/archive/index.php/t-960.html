I hold agro fairly well with my WMBS but would hate to think I could be doing it better.<br />

I guess basically what I'm asking is if you had a WMBS, would it be worth spending another 40K to buy the GoT?  Apparently they're reworking the drop rates on the BoT bosses anyway so there should be more of them on the market shortly - should I just wait?<br />

<br />
So if I were you I would wait on new purchase but up to you really.</div></div><hr />

Has price gone up or is it just server variations?  I'm on Xev, and I saw the same one up for over a week around 20k, and lowering every couple of days, I think I was the only one even looking for one at the time... Have seen one or two others for sale here and there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
did this happen already or is it going to happen?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brudal the Fat</div><div class="date">06-02-2003, 03:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the revamp was mentioned to go in last patch. Not a revamp really Sony just said the Tower bosses would always drop loot. <br />
<br />
Anyone who has done the towers knows you may spend that time for a fungus clump and symbol container. <br />
<br />
This, however did not go in the last patch so we wait...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">06-03-2003, 08:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">He specifically said he was talking about the Greatstaff of Thunder.  GoT drops off of a minor / random named (Rorek I believe) in south wing, and as far as I know they aren't doing anything to the drop rates of minor named.<br />
As for the question posted, if you're doing fine with aggro, I don't think it's worth 40k, though it is one of the best buyable weapons imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Septikk</div><div class="date">06-04-2003, 11:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the response all.   I had read that they were reworking the BoT named in general and hadn't realized it didn't apply to the lesser named that drop the GSoT.  Sorry for any confusion.</div></div><hr />
