<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">We all know PoP is sevely fooked up on max hit (3000+ are common)<br />
<br />
We all know 2H is THE WAY TO GO, both for DPS and AGRO<br />
(but not for HP)<br />
<br />
But the question :<br />
<br />
We have all head about the &quot;riposte rate Change&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Is it true ? im not looking for data (unless u have some)<br />
<br />
Mostly input from XP groups and personal feeling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grimmlokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1: If it was changed it's not a &quot;nerf&quot; as people keep saying. It's a fix, and a positive one.<br />
<br />
2: I notice zero difference. When I'm not tanking I'm generally still in the frontal arc of the mob for balance purposes and I seem to get riposted as much as ever. Couple of our other wars have said the same things. Mostly &quot;tested&quot; in PoAir.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Korak Sarathai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I am not in the elemental planes, but there has been a very noticable difference in the riposte rate of BoT mobs.  I haven't fought much anywhere else since the patch, so I won't comment on other areas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nevian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have been having my usual cleric watch my health in xp groups with duel wield and 2h.  So far he has noticed minimal damage taken differences in PoV(desert and inner/outer), PoS(mini's included), BoT giants and tactics (both roaming through ogres and pit).  Im inclined to say atleast in tier 2 and 3 it appears to be greatly reduced for duel wield.  haven't parsed it, just what i have noticed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aauminki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The took away Enrage :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Riposte rate has been noticably different on mobs in Plane of Disease, Nightmare and Innovation.<br />
<br />
My monk has dual wielded and off tanked some innovation mobs, and survived. In the past the mitigation problems and the ripostes would eat him up in seconds.<br />
<br />
My warrior has dual wielded and done just fine in the other two tier 1 zones I've been in since the patch.<br />
<br />
So tier 1, I've noticed things have changed.<br />
<br />
Plus they don't enrage anymore, which is nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Lhostee Chulain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I haven't seen any differences, although I haven't been watching all that closely. But if ya say that your all getting riposted less, I say ...........................         ROCK!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Choppin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'm going to say that they have not reduced riposte rates in PoP (at least on bosses) and I will stand by that until anyone proves different.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gnomb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It is quite a difference from when i started in PoV/S and BoT to today.<br />
But hard to prove as there are 4 levels and almost 70 AA difference since then to what caused this.<br />
I only can say i seem to take a lot less ripostes now than back then.<br />
But with maxed avoidance (CA3/LR5) it should be that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>zaos13</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">riposte is insanely gay for exp groups. i went back to primal/epic 2hander cause CHSD and red epic put more riposte dmg on me than the monster would normally dish out alone. this is patheticly lame....<br />
<br />
i almost died in a PoS giant group with a 1handers cause i got 3 ripostes in a row, NOT NICE</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kaldanm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">SOE should do that riposte activate only on main hand attack, depending on a ratio rate specific to the mob, not on the weapon delay (just like proc rate per minutes does not increase if you're hasted)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Cily</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Only problem with regulating riposte rates is once you do, you might as well remove the ability entirely because it no longer serves a function.<br />
<br />
The big bad named guys make good use of it, making any fight rely on at least a little luck. The problem is with XP mobs really.<br />
<br />
Too bad they didn't make Tactical Mastery a useful tool for limiting the impact riposte had on you. Could have been nice.<br />
<br />
Cily</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Lens314</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">They have not removed enrage from all mobs in PoN, hobgoblins and the gloom nightmare still enrage, found out the hard way...almost! :D  But in my PoS/PoV hutning which I do more of than PoN/PoD/PoI, im so glad they dont anymore.</div></div><hr />
