<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shorties</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So I know this is a bit off-topic since not totally warrior based but since I like peoples opinions here, I hope you will oblige.<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
<br />
So, since I play a warrior and have fun soloing with him but it's a class much more group oriented, I wanted another class when maybe a group just isn't there (I'm only 44) or when I don't have time or energy to do something involved and just want to have fun.<br />
<br />
So I want a casting class and one that can solo most of the time, especially 55+.  I'd like it if they added value to groups as well but not necessary since I have my tank for that.<br />
<br />
So here is how I see it, and I'm no expert...<br />
<br />
1)  Necro seems best able to solo I suppose although not sure groups care much for them.  That's the trade-off.<br />
2)  Mages seem to solo well but not sure 55+.  And the pure dps seems to help groups.<br />
3)  Wizards are 3rd and are quite straight forward in terms of what they do and their abilities 55+<br />
4)  Enchanters seem like they would have been the best for both solo and group but with the nerf to charm...<br />
<br />
Thoughts?<br />
<br />
Much appreciated!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />
<br />
:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>gerili</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Solo classes:<br />
<br />
Necromancer:  Very capable of soloing, and to the wise a very good addition to any group needing dps.<br />
<br />
Enchanters:  Enchanters have been able to solo with the best of them at high levels, tend to struggle a bit at lower levels, especially with no snare.  A very welcomed class to any group.<br />
<br />
Shaman:  Very capable soloers and groupers.  Able to solo a lot of mobs others have not.  Very welcomed in groups.<br />
<br />
Beastlord:  Able to solo from 1-65.  Some very good abilities at high levels, although dont see a lot grouping very often.<br />
<br />
Wizard:  Good soloers till round 60 or so, and can go to 65 with the right gear.  Welcomed in raids, and some groups for their dps.<br />
<br />
Mage:  Good soloers till round 60ish.  Life gets harder for them, can still be done just not nearly as easily.  Welcomed in a lot of groups for dps.<br />
<br />
Druids:  Able to solo from 1-65, and very well.  Probably the most versitile soloer IMO, nearly every option available, but then again im probably biased :) I play a druid.  Have some desireablilty in groups but every idiot has a druid and has given them a bad name.<br />
<br />
Of course couple other classes can solo but not as effeciently, especially at higher levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mourningloree</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Necro still best soloer and the charm nerf doesn't hurt their xp any...  Necro swarm kite is just broken...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gnomb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Best solo class 50+ is a bard, especially with PoP having a lot of outdoor zones for swarm kiting.<br />
Not to mention the class is also very sought after for groups and raids unlike other good solo classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Bards will give your carpal tunel tho, necro's are a breeze to solo compared to that.<br />
<br />
If I had to change classes with soloability currently as a big trait i'd have to go necro. Not just for the solo power alone but also the self serving utility that goes with it - Invuln, both invis types (instant on both if gear / aa), res and FD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shorties</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks for info.<br />
<br />
I didn't know shamans can solo pretty well 55+.<br />
<br />
Yes, it still seems necros are the kings of solo.  I was almost going to start a mage, but thanks for letting me know that 55 or 60+ is hard for them.<br />
<br />
Beastlords really can solo that well all the time?!?!  So why don't they get invited into groups?  Is it because they simply don't need them or just add nothing?<br />
<br />
So people have added necros to groups (not just raids) 60+?<br />
<br />
Well, looks like I'll probably create a nice little grumpy as hell looking gnome necro.  I've never played an evil race so might be kind of nice to be able to kill everything (assuming you can).<br />
<br />
Especially since with PoP travel is so easy you don't need to worry quite as much about faction as a necro (do you?)<br />
<br />
Thanks again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Crist0</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Shaman can solo the hardest stuff yes, but they are VERY inefficient soloers at that point. Wizards and druids probably rank towards the top along with necros. Beastlords not far behind, and with the opening of the con range mages will be up there too.<br />
<br />
And necros ROCK in groups, provided they know what they are doing. The faction bit just means more stuff to kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gartogg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Beastlords can solo that well all the time, if your twinking one get him a fungi staff at level 35 and your pretty much good to go solo wise.  An added bonus is the beast epic is quite good and is doable by 1 group of level 60's without difficulty.<br />
<br />
As for why you don't see beastlords grouping, not sure.  I group with one all the time, we use him as the main slower and buffer, honestly I hate not having a beast in a group now that I'm use to it, in almost all situations I would rather have a beastlord than an enchanter, monk, rogue, wizard, mage, or necro, I find them that versitle and useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Many still count the beastlord as that bastard child class SoE threw in to sell luciln, and as such don't group with them. Not to say I love or hate having a BST in group, most of the time there's simply no room for one personally. In pickup groups tho if they're not some retard set loose in tier 3 it's usually some good stuff ;p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shorties</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thank you for the replies.<br />
<br />
Of course I'm still no closer to deciding.  Pat of me wanted to just play both a caster and pet class since I've never done that (outside of my main warrior).<br />
<br />
Now I'm torn between Beastlord and Necro and Mage not knowing who a group would want _should_ I decide to group but more important who can solo 55+ no prob...<br />
<br />
I guess I shouldnt worry about the group part as much since if you made friends, it's not as bad (and can play your class).<br />
<br />
Necro seems the safest...<br />
<br />
:eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Skullreaper Zek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Go with a Bard. <br />
<br />
You get a bit of everything and flexible regarding any changes in heart you may have. You can solo (Fear Kite, Charm Kite/Swarm Kite and Chant Kite, BEST haste in game as you can go over the cap), Group (OMG too numerous benefits to a group) you can Melee (Most Weaps available, Plate Class), you can cast (Nice DoTs, Charm Pets, some smaller DDs).<br />
<br />
You choose a Necro, you are basically stuck in that mode. I like the ability to swap roles when needed. Haha - that being said, a Bard was not tough enough to tank so I created Skullreaper :D <br />
<br />
I would rank:<br />
1. Bard<br />
2. Necro<br />
3. Mage<br />
4. Druid<br />
5. Wiz<br />
6. SK<br />
7. Monk (if twinked and buffed make very strong situation soloers. One Monk has been soloing Naggy and Vox repeatedly.) ** but not a caster so NM **<br />
<br />
Good luck with your decision.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>slyse</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">You choose a Necro, you are basically stuck in that mode. <br />
<br />
If by &quot;that mode&quot; you mean soloing, then you don't know what a necro can do.  =P<br />
<br />
In my opinion, necros are one of the most underrated group classes out there.  They debuff, they do sick dps, they can mez in a pinch (although I think it's level capped, not sure since my necro didn't make it high enough to find one), they provide mana for your healers or crowd control people, and they can stack some buffs on top of any other buffs you can get (in the same way SKs do).   The only problem is, you have to have a necro who knows what he's doing if you want to see the real benefits.   To people in the know, though, necros are a great addition to any group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Skullreaper Zek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Nope. Simply meant in a predominantly caster mode. But certainly the necros can do other things beside soloing - however keep in mind that they were aimed at soloing to begin with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Shorties</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Thanks again.<br />
<br />
The same way this site is great for meleer's, is there a site besides EQ Casters you recommend for necro/mages or casters in general I can post to, to get specific answers on this question, twink necessary gear, etc?<br />
<br />
THANKS!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>xalmatelemental</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Like stated above, Mages can solo to 65. However after level 60 it gets hard, and slow. Very slow. And very hard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kiya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I've been experimenting with a beastlord and would highly reccomend it.  You could tank a bit, play pet healer, buffer for group, off-tank.  I've been enjoying myself when I play it after getting sick of X hours of lfg and not wanting to dual comp.  :)</div></div><hr />
