<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nayl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Yesterday I picked up a Prism of Dark Hues from the Animal Ring in Qvic, replacing my old Clawed Earthcrafter's Hoop.  Excellent upgrade, I'm very happy with it, but there is one small problem.  Like several other pieces of gear I've gotten recently, the Prism has no Atk modifier on it.  Unlike Time loot, a lot of the GoD loot seems to neglect Atk.  I've gone from having a worn Atk of 350 to only 230.  <br />
<br />
So my question is, where in GoD, or OoW, can I find augments that have +Atk modifiers?  LDoN isn't an option for this, I'm not grinding out 14 missions just for one +15 atk aug.  Also, any aug has to be type 8, the Hoop was my last pre-Time piece of equipment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I had 350 before entering time.<br />
I entered Time it dropped to 220.<br />
I'm entering Tacvi, and its down to 150.<br />
If i knew better (Lodestar for range) i would be at 100 atk.<br />
<br />
Its really hard to have 250atk if you go for pure tanking.<br />
<br />
<br />
PS : Dont even bother with +ATK augments, our DPS contribution wont make/break a group/raid</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Busstin1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You can get + 20 attack augs in Kodtaz i got some just cause they were going to rott but i dont even use them anymore  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>OrgroInsanity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Don't waste the Augment slot.. Nearly all my augment slots have AC or HP in them, just not enough room.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rueeliar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Same.  Not a day goes by that I dont wish I could pop out my haste aug for another 40 hp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Slassh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">40 hp need to all be deleted. saying that, why you been so nasty to me Rifts!!! 4 hours for one aug, like wtf</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Lemos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Can't live on a pvp server without max attack.. =\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Aonodorus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">armor was designed that way, makes you think about your buys some.  if you want to go all out for tanking, that's fine, but you'll have to give up on attack.<br />
<br />
there's a few items that have large +atk, effigy of kelekdrix comes to mind... but not many that are the primo items for their respective slots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Khumak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yep you have to make sacrifices in ATK for the best tanking gear.  There are a few items that fit both molds with excellent tanking stats as well as big ATK bonuses but they are few and far between.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I believe it is best to maximize your DPS as much as possible because DPS is damage mitigation too.  The faster something dies, the less you've to tank it.  While Warrior DPS is nothing to write home about it's certainly nontrivial.<br />
<br />
That said I won't lose sleep over lacking attack, but I try to keep a reasonable balance.</div></div><hr />

One of the very few times you will ever catch me agreeing with Lemos!</div></div><hr />
