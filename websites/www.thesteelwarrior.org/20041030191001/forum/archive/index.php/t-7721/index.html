<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Figg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am currently using a Copper Hammer of Striking (with anger 2 aug) and a Sword of the Bloodsworn that I would like to purchase an anger 3 aug for.  I have read some posts that if you are under 65 that the stats of your weapon will drop once the aug is added.  Is this true?  Being only lvl 58, would this happen?  If so, would it be a waste for me to spend those points on that aug now?  I spend most of my time in LDoN's and agro is a top priority for me since you never know who you will have in your group.  There are too many rangers out there that think its so cool to out agro a warrior. :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">do not augment it with anger 3.<br />
your agro set up is ok like this. if you still want more, agment it with Slimestone Fragment of Shock (strike of ykesha, slot 4) have a better agro than anger 2 and has a lvl recomendation of 60, thus you will loose less stat and for a shorter time.<br />
or better, let the ranger die !  they have to learn humility.<br />
<br />
note that at your lvl, you can ask for the bigger dex buff in order to help you to proc more often. or try to get a 'prismatic like' weapon (avatar helps a lot to increase proc rate when we aren't at max dex) for the beginnig of the fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">they are making augments removable and reusable ... go for the anger3 as you will never ever ever replace it.  suck it up and live with it for a few lvs  :p</div></div><hr />

You can temporarily rig up your Magelo profile with the augment to see how much difference in damage there would be based on your level.  Yes it will probably shave a point or two off the damage (and other stats), but I've never seen an augment increase the delay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Figg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think I will go ahead and get the Anger 3 aug.  That is what I have been saving for anyway.  All my points are in the Everfrost &amp; Butcherblock camps so it would take a long time to build up the points for Guk.  My only other option is buying the 760 pt arms in Everfrost.  But I think the aug will be more useful atm.  Thanks for your input!  :)</div></div><hr />
