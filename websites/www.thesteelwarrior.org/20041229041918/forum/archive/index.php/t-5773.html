<br />
Its especially unfortunate when these people are clerics and/or your evaccers, and you are far inside the dungeon, leaving you stranded.<br />
<br />
I also noticed today that a mob seemingly agroed on someone that was following behind me(on a horse), even though I was closer to the mob. At least it looked like that.<br />
<br />
Anyone else have noticed this? Or am I totally imagining this.</div></div><hr />

That's the easiest explanation anyway.<br />
<br />
Pretty ouchie if so, horses will go back to being somewhat annoying transportation devices instead of the faux-FT mana regen items they are now...<br />
<br />
Wouldn't surprise me, will try and do a few tests with some expendib... er, willing casters soonish.<br />

<br />
I dont like sitting on horses unless I have to when I play casters personally (well except for mage/wiz) cause I do a lotta ducking with priests/chanters personally so it kinds ruins my style.</div></div><hr />

Druid typically sits on a drogmar, Beast pulls with slow.  If I don't stay between the mob and the druid when I pull, they will almost invariably turn and go smack him.  This is after being slowed by the Beast, and before the Druid has so much as belched.</div></div><hr />

Or was it like monk FD in that it's use wasn't intended, and is just a lucky result?</div></div><hr />

LOL, I would have to say it's the druid and not the horse. I know it's either paranoia and/or just bad luck, but I'd swear my druid gets more aggro just for the fact that he's a druid, sitting on a horse or not. I remember pl'ing a wizard around level 20 with my level 65 druid in East Karana. We'd both be standing there and level 15-20 mobs would come up and smack the druid, leaving the juicy level-appropriate wizard alone. This happened even when both characters were medding, or both were just standing there. More than once, a lion or gnoll would walk right over the wizard to smack the druid further away.<br />
<br />
Go figure.</div></div><hr />
