<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>RebecaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm looking for upgrade advice for my lvl 49 warrior alt. My main is a cleric, so I dont' know much about weopons like dmg/dly...aggro etc.<br />
<br />
I just finished getting her upgrades from the bazaar mostly. I'm looking for suggestions on gear I could buy, or camp with a group with my main.<br />

<br />
Weopons:<br />
<br />
I'm looking to see what I should buy for upgrades in the future. Like when she gets closer to 60.  <br />
<br />
I don't know whats good for aggro weopons.....or if I should also buy a 2h for just DPS??  :confused: <br />
<br />
Gear:<br />
 Like the weopons..I&quot;m looking to see what I should consider getting her for upgrades in the future. Like when she starts getting to lvl 60ish.  I know AC/Hps are important...I hear it enough even as a cleric.  ;)  <br />
<br />
Is there any other stat I should look for? Any Effects besides Vengance? <br />
<br />
I've been looking for gear with some dex on it too...because of the procs on my weopons. Is that important?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any info/suggestions!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>zito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Your current agro weapons are good, and will last you until you can upgrade via raiding.  If you aren't always tanking, then yes a non-agro 2H weapon would be a good idea.  I'd recommend War Marshal's Bladed Staff.  They're usually around the 10k mark or so on most servers, it seems.<br />
<br />
For possible armour upgrades; another Valorium ring would be nice.  Also on my list would be to replace your bracelet of fortitude.  Ornate would be nice there, and the molds seem to be coming down in price lately.  As well, you can camp ornate in BoT with your friends; a pair of bracers, and the arms would be nice, and the helm would be very nice.  Overall, your gear is pretty solid.  Concentrate on HP/AC first.  Some ppl will tell you that HP&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; AC all the time, but that opinion varies widely.  For myself, I use the rule of thumb that 1 AC equals about 5-8 HP or so.  Also, gear with more sta would be nice, for the extra HP.  Saves are also really useful, imo.  More dex on armour sure can't hurt, but the effect of it is fairly minor.  However, it does all add up over time.<br />
<br />
Also, do lots of LDoN adventures if you can.  The anger proc augs you can buy will make a HUGE difference in how well you hold agro, and as well, there is some very nice armour available from the adventure point merchants; Malevolent gear from Miragul's, and the Royal Attendant armour from the N Ro camp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>RebecaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks! :) I forgot about resists!!<br />
