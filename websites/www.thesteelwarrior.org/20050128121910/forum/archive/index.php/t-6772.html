I'm seriously considering starting over on FV server.  I like my guild on my current server, but I can send them cross-server tells if I wanna chat.  I've played a 50+ BST SHM MAG BRD ROG WAR ( 3 of these are lvl 65 ) up on my home server.  I was thinking about starting an Iksar Monk  on FV since they aren't totally gear dependant to play, but I'm worried about being able to carry my loots home to sell and make plat.  I am also considering a Troll SK.  Just anything but the classes I've already played to 50+.  I'm looking for your suggestions on classes to play to be able to solo at lower lvls, but needed in raiding guilds on FV.  Also, is FV the server I should be looking at?</div></div><hr />

Have you played a character above level 50?  I use to have a ton of toons that were all different levels.  Then I settled down on my warrior, moved all my gear and plat onto him, and joined a raiding guild.  <br />
<br />
There is so much more to the game once I started raiding.  So many levels and places I have never seen.  I could understand if you're Time Geared but if you have only lvl 50 toons then theres still a huge world to explore!</div></div><hr />

That answers your question.</div></div><hr />

  The choice is yours to make and no ones elses but here is some advice.  If i was going to start over on a new server I would pick a beastlord to play, they really are not gear dependant and can solo nicely.  They are great for groups because they can buff almost as good as shamans and they are 3rd at slowing. <br />
<br />
<br />
FV  I have a 34 beastlord and the majority of the players are mature.  Their is alot of roleplaying of course and you will have to learn elvish since that is the common language used.   There is no /ooc only /shout and most people don't have a sense of homur.  The /market channel is the server auction channel and most people use that as social channel.  The server economy sucks everything is overpriced not because of the no drop items are droppable because the FV server has the most Ebay plat buyers than any other server.    Everything is overpriced even a spider fur belt that can go for 100pp on other servers on FV it would cost 3k.  I am serious it is that bad.    <br />
<br />
<br />
Raiding guilds.<br />
<br />
There is 2 guilds in Time Fire and Fury and I forget the other.  There are alot of other guilds that are working there way through POP and other zones.  So finding a guild  that suits you wouldn't be hard to do.  I really can not comment on what they would need it all depends on what they are looking for at that time.   <br />
<br />
For more information check out the FV server board here is the link.<br />

Hope this helps but like I said this choice is yours to make.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Fire and Fury: my former guild that I'm actually going back to once I meet the requirements with my warrior.  Great guild, great people, funny as hell, they raid fairly well and are by far the farthest guild on the server.<br />
<br />
Resolution: Second farthest guild, stuck in P4 Time though, not nearly as well equipped or anything, I don't like them much their loot distribution sucks IMO don't like most of the people etc.  not nearly as skilled as FnF.<br />
<br />
Forgotten Nemesis: Euro guild in Sol Ro Tower atm 3rd farthest, they seem fairly good and seem like nice people though I haven't interacted too terribly much with them.  Anyways it isn't much of a choice if you aren't Euro unless you can make the odd times.<br />
<br />
Those are the 3 main raiding guilds that are still around.<br />
<br />
Far as pricing goes yes everything is overpriced probably, but you can buy nearly anything if you have the time and/or the money<br />
<br />
*shrugs* I dunno, I like it on FV been there nearly since it opened and I really wouldn't want to be anywhere else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grendonbb</div><div class="date">04-20-2004, 02:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">FV rocks.  I play mainly on Bristlebane but I made a char on FV... Beastlord, leveled up to 55 fairly quickly.  It is definately a blast to play on a server with so much cool loot floating around that is droppable.  It's really up to you.  I don't play BST much anymore, but I do log on her occasionally.<br />
<br />
And in case you were wondering about the sense of humor that FnF guys have (I'm sure somewhere this link was posted, but it's too hilarious):  How not to apply to a guild (http://www.fnfguild.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1649&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=0)<br />
<br />
Last 2 posts on page 6 are the best, after that the next 30+ pages are boring as hell, but through page 6 it's a freakin riot.</div></div><hr />

Like the one in Tactics many of thier members were caught and announced that they used that exploit and no actions were taken by the GL.</div></div><hr />
