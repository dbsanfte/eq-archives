However, this essentially means when you upgrade gear, you can just pop it out and put it in the new item.  Or, people like me who in a drunken fit put a 15ac aug in ornate legs instead of Raex Gloves...</div></div><hr />

You can turn purchased augs in to a gnome at the South Ro camp to get a refund in points.  Only works on purchased augs.</div></div><hr />

Good,  I bought an anger II aug cause it was cheaper at the time.  Would be nice to be able to  take that out, turn it in for points, and use the points toward upgrading it to Anger III.</div></div><hr />

This gnome is being removed.  The new adventure merchant screen will now have a &quot;sell&quot; option as well as a buy.  It will work like a regular merchant.  You will only be able to &quot;sell&quot; back an item (aug or item) for 50 percent of the points it takes to buy it.</div></div><hr />
