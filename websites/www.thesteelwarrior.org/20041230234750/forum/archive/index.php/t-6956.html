save your coppers and hunt your bazaar.</div></div><hr />

save your coppers and hunt your bazaar.<br />
<br />
Once you hit level 65 and pour on the AA, you'll find your HP will go up on it's own...your stats will go up as the quality of your groupmates buffs increase also.<br />
<br />
As most people have said, a lot of the AC upgrades aren't worthwhile if it's 100% soloable by a warrior...loyalist shield of honor is mostly soloable, but not entirely...and I'm still waiting for final mob to spawn myself, so can be large time sink.   The only exception to that rule, is camping in the bazaar is soloable...if you can manage to accumulate the money.  The other strategy would be to try grouping in areas were upgrades drop (e.g., GoD, Hard LDoN's) or can be earned (e.g., LDoN).<br />
<br />
Other than that, my advice would be to scan every post where people ask about armor upgrades and look at people's magelo's to get ideas for upgrades...that's what I do.  :)  I myself have alternate profiles on magelo to see what I'd look like if i were a platinum king (bazaar) or ldon lifer (gear from adventure points).</div></div><hr />

<br />
At 65, try to do some hards, or go to GoD to get some nice dropable upgrades.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pisco_ssour</div><div class="date">05-05-2004, 02:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hmmm. ok thx guys, i was hoping there'd seom soloable ( ye very long ) good quest out there but i guess there rn't. thx :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">05-05-2004, 03:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">fun little quest is the GnollSlayer; but just for the summon:dog part with his one hit point or something.<br />
ain't many things worthwhile in EQ that a warrior can solo at 65 that's worth having besides the WE illusion cap which is listed here somewhere ( Crown of Deceit? )...but at that; i think you'll need a group for a few of the drops needed ( never did the quest myself so no help there ).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">05-06-2004, 09:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, do the gnollslayer.<br />
Do it with a few select guildmate melee classes. Might as well work on your alcohol tolerance while you're doing it.<br />
Although it's not practical, having a pet for a little while is fun. Used properly, it's good for considerable amusement.<br />
<br />
Another gizmo that is possibly kinda cool for a warrior who occassionally solos, is the shiny brass idol. Drops in high pass. Haven't had one for a while, but I think it makes you immune to damage for 18 seconds (during which you cannot be casted on/healed or do damage yourself, but you *can* be running for the zoneline). It's not a quest, though, you just go kill a green-mob orc.</div></div><hr />
