<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tarran Loreweaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">First of all, I'm talking about NPC flurry, not warrior flurry.<br />
<br />
I've noticed over the past month or so that often when an a mob flurries I will get hit by it, even though I am not the one tanking. It seems to happen most often in phase 1 trials in Plane of Time. Best way to explain everything would be a quick example I suppose, so here goes:<br />
<br />
Example, Warrior_01 is tanking Named_Mob in a trial.<br />
Named_mob executes a FLURRY of attacks on Warrior_01!<br />
Named_mob tries to hit you but misses.<br />
Named_mob hits you for 980 damage.<br />
Named_mob tries to hit you but misses.<br />
You tell Warrior_01, 'Did you just get hit by that flurry?'<br />
Warrior_01 tells you, 'No'<br />
You tell Warrior_01 'I didn't think so, because it hit me, sorta like ramp or something'<br />
Warrior_01 tells you, 'wierd'<br />
<br />
I move away to go root park some other mob in the trial and while I'm out of melee range:<br />
Named_mob executes a FLURRY of attacks on Warrior_01!<br />
You tell Warrior_01, 'Did you get hit by that flurry?'<br />
Warrior_01 tells you, 'Yeah'<br />
<br />
As you can see, I'm getting hit by flurries that were obviously meant for some one else according to the flurry message and HoTT. If I move out of melee range, I stop getting hit by them and I will no longer get hit by them after I move back into melee range. From what I can tell, this only happens to 1 person per mob, so it isn't working exactly like rampage list. If the 1 person moves away, the flurries go back to the tank and seem to stay there for the rest of the fight.<br />
<br />
If I had to guess, I'd say this is a bug. But since it could potentially be used to players' advantage, and I've posted about it now, I'd imagine it will get fixed soon.<br />
<br />
So anyone have any thoughts on this? Anyone else ever notice this happening? Anyone know why it happens or what causes it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hmmm I haven't noticed anything weird. The only mobs I've been fighting that flurry are in ssra and they were all hitting me and no one else in the group. Maybe next time we take out Grieg or SoL I'll see if there's any difference. Of course the mob could be doing 'fake' flurry and is really rampaging, but that shouldn't hit the MT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bulbog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Heh flurry= ramp, ramp= flurry in some zones.  You'll see this in zones like PoAir and PoEarth like Xegony rampaging is her flurrying.  PoE trash rampages but they're really flurrying.  Just a text bug, not sure why it was never fixed though.  Been like that for a long time though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Khumak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Some bosses have bugged messages and are actually rampaging rather than flurrying or vice versa.  Mith Marr for example says he's rampaging but is actually flurrying.  I haven't noticed any problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Xarilok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Notice that he says if he goes out of melee/rampage range, and back in, he does NOT get the fake flurry/ramp, nor does anyone else.<br />
<br />
This seems to be a bug, where a real flurry simply hits the wrong target for some unknown reason.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bulbog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Nvm misread the second part.  That would be a bug yeah heh.  Usually on bugged ramp(says flurry) flurry says it hits the ramp target so what you experienced would be something else I guess.  Yeah can't think of an explanation for the moving back in and it not happening anymore other than being a bug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Some mobs are capable of rampaging and flurrying at the same time.  Like you could see a mob goes on a rampage but it'd do a flurry on the its current target as well, or vice versa with flurry.  <br />
<br />
It also seems to me a lot of mobs also rampage the top target as well on top of anyone else they might hit (sometimes no one, like Xegony or any trash in PoEarth).  <br />
<br />
Usually I just end up assuming anything that can flurry/rampage can do both and treat them accordingly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
so does mith marr rampage at all?  My RT tonight thought he took some rampage hits early on, but he said once I got MM cornered, there weren't any.  He thought it was something funky with LMM being up on that pillar, which didn't sound right to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">MM doesn't rampage at all. You're RT was getting agro/ripostes.</div></div><hr />
