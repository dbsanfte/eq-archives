<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>TearsumRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I usually wear Valorium Ring and Ring of the Shissar. Well, I was finally able to get the elemental stone and my wife was successful on the combine. My question is, should I go with the Steel Ring and the Shissar ring or Steel ring and Valorium? I was thinking Steel Ring and Shissar for the extra HP boost, one of the other wars in my guild said that it was NOT worth losing the stats of the Valorium for the few extra HP so he said Steel Ring and Valorium.  Any thoughts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have never been a big fan of the Ring of the Shissar. The 80hp are nice, but I think your friend is right, the 15hp is not worth the stats you are losing from the Valorium ring (that is assuming that your stats aren't maxed.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grendonbb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hp &gt; All... go with shissar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Crumm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Especially since your stats are pretty much maxed already. <br />
<br />
Str8 HPs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ask that guy to be /guildremoved.  Stats are worthless, always have been.  If you cap stamina without the 8 off the Valorium ring, then get rid of it.  It's of no use to you anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Malek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I wouldn't even worry about capping sta, just keep it within 60 of your cap and a shammy will max it, upping your raid hp's 15 with the shissar ring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Hyardgune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I gotta go with Haass on this one.  Why is this guy still in your guild?  Take hit points (and ac) over stats any day of the week.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>gleb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">yup, I agree with Haass.  Hps &gt; all.  if your sta is 245 unbuffed, then dump the gallantry ring.  I say 245 because all warriors should get Planar Power 5 .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">nm, should of looked at your Magelo. You have no need for stats as you are maxed anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bulbog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Eh by stats he could be referring to the resists on valorium vs none on the shissar but still shissar &gt; valorium, wish shissar at least had some resists though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Cyphan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I dropped my valorium when I got the shissar. Im going for 9k raid buffed and I need all the raw HPs I can get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">HP, and to a lesser extent, AC &gt; all.<br />
<br />
shissar and steel ring all the way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Grimmlokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Lesser extent? Bite thy tongue!!!!! =P</div></div><hr />

<br />
HP/AC &gt; all <br />
<br />
Earthen + shissar. Sell the vallorium for some PP or give it to me and Ill sell it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just a point of order here ...<br />
<br />
not trying to rock the boat or anything ...<br />
<br />
but remember stats affect your endurance pool now.<br />
<br />
They're not totally worthless. Just semi-worthless.<br />
<br />
:P<br />
<br />
That being said, if you're already maxxing your stats when buffed, go with the higher raw hit points.<br />
<br />
But keep the valorium ring around if you are having trouble reaching a resist plateau or something.</div></div><hr />
