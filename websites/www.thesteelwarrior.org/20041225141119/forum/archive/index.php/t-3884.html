<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Merc</div><div class="date">10-27-2003, 03:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A post in another thread got me thinking about this so here is the rant.<br />
<br />
Server changes are NOT fair and balanced for all classes.  Casting classes get to keep all their spells upon server transfer, while melee's get a big fat zero.  I cannot think of any reason why this would be the case.  I would really like to hear the reasoning behind this policy from someone at SoE but I'm sure that will never happen.<br />
<br />
A 60-65 chanter with KEI, a cleric with HoV, Mage with epic returned even wizards with massive damage nukes or druids with soloing abilities can quickly rack up ALOT of plat in which to reequip themselves.....and we all know how cheap pure caster gear is.  Even Wis caster gear isn't anywhere near on par with amounts needed to equip a tanking class.  Knights need only acquire some decent armor (still admittedly hard) and they have their spells to hold aggro.  The warrior need to not only acquire new aggro generating weapons (argueably some of the most expensive items in game) but they need haste, and high AC/HP gear in order to just do their job.<br />
<br />
WTF was Sony thinking with this?  Even a monk can use his fists as decent weapons until he gets better.  A rogue can find some low end gear and piercers and as long as they don't steal aggro the only thing a group will notice is that xp seems a bit &quot;slow&quot;.  The Warrior who is gimped out by a recent server transfer will become IMMEDIATELY noticeable.  He'll be unable to hold aggro, unable to deal with aggro when he gets it from his lack of AC/HP's and will cause the entire group to fall apart.<br />
<br />
This is just ridiculous IMO.  If the goal is to keep the character from benefiting monetarily by selling gear then just allow transfer of NO DROP items.  I'd rather a have few &quot;holes&quot; in my gear than be buck ass naked.  Maybe allowing a pure melee either No Drop armor OR weapons would at least allow them (especially the warrior) a stepping stone in which to get started on the new server.<br />
<br />
Allowing casters complete access to spellbooks and giving pure melee nothing further reinforces in my mind that Sony is blind to the needs of melee classes and ESPECIALLY the warrior.<br />

<br />
This in fact was my EXACT situation and EXACT reason for transferring.  After little more than a month on my new server my HP/AC is already better than it was on my previous server.  However, this doesn't change the fact that SoE seems to bend over to the demands of casters while ignoring the needs of warriors.<br />
<br />
Also, whoa be the warrior that transfers without some friends willing to help him out.  I guess he can punch his way through Unrest or beg gear of people in PoK.  How sad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tasso</div><div class="date">10-27-2003, 09:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It has somthing to do with droppable gear. If i buy a shitload of droppable rare gear that nolonger drops and move to a newer server that never had that gear I could get top dollar for that gear.<br />
<br />
Thats the excuse they have.<br />
<br />
that is the exact reason they had for watching transfers to stormhammer.<br />
<br />
(read this on a msg board)<br />
A person from one server went to stormhammer and bought a manastone. They then went back to the server that they came from but the gm took it away when they did the transfer.<br />
<br />
The server they came from never had a manastone on it and they wanted to keep it that way.<br />
<br />
could they only allow nodrop equipment to transfer? sure. but that would require work i guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tugurok</div><div class="date">10-27-2003, 10:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Merc is right. Obviously gear dependent classes get boned more when gear is stripped than non-gear dependent classes. <br />
<br />
Maybe in EQ2 SoE will get a handle on itemization, including the extent to which certain classes are dependent on items. They don't have much of a handle now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
GET A GRIP MY OGRE CHUM  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Timrum</div><div class="date">10-27-2003, 03:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hey SOE take how much for a server move ? 50$ i think ?<br />
<br />
every dumbass coder can code a prog that check the gear on a char and delete &quot;not allowed&quot; items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zynth</div><div class="date">10-27-2003, 07:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i imagin the item data base to be insane by now, let alone some special servers with odd rules, like FV where everythign is droppable aside from epics.<br />
<br />
can some one humor me on server transfers, what do you lose?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NinjaBurger</div><div class="date">10-27-2003, 08:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you move to/from Stormhammer, nothing.<br />
<br />
<br />
Otherwise, you lose EVERYTHING.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pet is da tank till funds grow :p<br />
<br />
Warr cant compete with that advantage.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Binnamar</div><div class="date">10-27-2003, 09:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Like someone said above, just code it so there is a program that deletes droppable stuff,  and lets you keep nodrop stuff. Boom problem solved. <br />
<br />
Too bad it won't happen.</div></div><hr />
