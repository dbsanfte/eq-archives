<br />
And might I add, I love this in my range slot, but is there a chance to accidently toss it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anker steadfast</div><div class="date">11-17-2003, 08:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes it's 41% according to Magelo.<br />
(Magelo link : http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=27949 )<br />
It doesn't have any Range stat though, so I don't think it can be thrown.<br />
Anyways, you don't throw your ranged slot if you get charmed anymore, so just remove your Ranged attack button and things should be fine. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pumilio</div><div class="date">11-17-2003, 09:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm going to have to test this throwing deal, anyone know a item without any range to it that fits in range, and if it can be thrown or not?  <br />
<br />
Also, are there any other 41% haste items that are tradeable like this one is?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arathena</div><div class="date">11-17-2003, 09:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I couldn't throw my Idol of the Thorned, chanced are you can't chuck your Scalecracker either. (Though Innoruuk only knows how many Runed Bone Forks I've flung into the ether.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pumilio</div><div class="date">11-17-2003, 09:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's what I'm thinking, myself</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KoGuiN</div><div class="date">11-17-2003, 09:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">no you cannot throw your scalecracker, dont worry, if there isnt a range number on an item oyu cannot throw it by pressing the range attack button.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pumilio</div><div class="date">11-17-2003, 09:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Glad to know, now.  Who thinks I gots one of the coolest range slot items? hehe there are only like 9 haste items in game better for hp/ac and with 41%</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">11-17-2003, 11:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wondered about this one for a while too. Had a no drop range item and always wondered if I could accidentally throw it away. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anker steadfast</div><div class="date">11-17-2003, 11:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh, that would be weird if you could throw a No Drop item ... but .. didn't some Rogues throw their Ragebringer before it was made non-range slot ?<br />
<br />
Anyways, yes, that hammer has excellent stats for a range slot, 33 AC, 41% haste, 100 HP and the 15 STA is kinda nice, though many cap out on STA pretty fast ... but it's veeery nice. :)<br />
<br />
How hard did the Avatar of Fright hit again ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pumilio</div><div class="date">11-17-2003, 11:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay I think just about anyone can tank the avatar of fright to be frank, I need to look at logs but I remember most hits bieng between 200-300<br />
<br />
you can thrown no drop items though /cough shissar fangs<br />
<br />
This event with a proper raid force is very fun, you do want alot of dps or a ton of CC lol.  we wiped because we didn't ahve our DPS concentrated enough so didn't keep up with spawns, but we managed to kill the first and second golem with about 14 mobs up  = )<br />
<br />
was almost through with third but CC can only do sooo much when there's three of em.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Griglon</div><div class="date">11-17-2003, 09:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This mob is new to me.  Which zone is he in and how often does the scalecracker drop?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pumilio</div><div class="date">11-18-2003, 08:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Zone: Cazic Thule<br />
From the Event ring of Fear located in the sewers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Choppin</div><div class="date">11-18-2003, 10:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">so err if I were to do this ring once for twink loot, how many elemental equipped people would I need? like 12? 18?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Surlok</div><div class="date">11-18-2003, 10:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We tried it with 16 All elemenatal and time,We were unprepared for the amount of mobs present.<br />
<br />
It has been toned down a bit from its origanl version but there is still a  great deal of CC involved.We only had a bard present for actual mez the rest we did through offtanking and root but we just couldn't last...<br />
With 2 chanters you could probably do with 18 or so I suppose.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pumilio</div><div class="date">11-18-2003, 10:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah like I said, this isn't to be underestimated a small number of e-quiped unless they have mad dps, just won't keep up with the kill rate required.  <br />
<br />
I suppose it can be done with 18, but seriously would recommend 24-30+ just to make it easy and not a pain in ass if all e-quiped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">11-18-2003, 01:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What is the trigger for the ring of fear?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arathena</div><div class="date">11-18-2003, 02:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">From my time in CT a long time ago, I seem to remember that just stepping into the bubble or something like that to start it up. <br />
Monk tells the group, &quot;Inc 3 yellow cons.&quot; is kinda ugly at level 60. :-p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pumilio</div><div class="date">11-19-2003, 01:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just go into the room and kill everything, then event will start.  don't get suprised by the untargetable justicars explode and do dd and knockback.</div></div><hr />
