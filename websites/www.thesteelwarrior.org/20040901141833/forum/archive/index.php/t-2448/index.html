<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zukobim AB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Warriors can already taunt a mob, but what if we got a skill that made us take the blame for others actions?<br />
<br />
I was thinking about something like this,<br />
<br />
Skillname: Take the blame (someone might find a better name)<br />
Target: Group, except caster<br />
Duration: 5 ticks<br />
Refresh: 30 ticks @ level 50 -&gt; 25 ticks @ 60<br />
Effect: All agro generated by the groupmembers add 10% to the warrior as well.<br />
Timer: Same as defensive<br />
Buffwindow: Short duration buff window<br />
<br />
This skill will allow the warrior to benefit from the other groupmembers agro, but they still have to watch it.<br />
<br />
Example 1.<br />
<br />
Ranger fires an arrow in a mob and cause 30 agropoints, which gives the warrior 3 agropoints.<br />
The chanter tash on inc and cause 300 agropoints, which raise the warrior to 33.<br />
Warrior still needs 267 agropoints to get agro over the chanter.<br />
Chanter continues with a slow right after tash and generate 300 more agropoints, rising to 600 agropoints on the mobs hatelist, but the warrior also gets 30 more, which brings him to 63 or 557 less than the chanter.<br />
<br />
This example shows how a warrior is only helped a little with this skill.<br />
<br />
Example 2.<br />
<br />
Ranger fires an arrow in a mob and cause 30 agropoints, which gives the warrior 3 agropoints.<br />
The chanter tash on inc and cause 300 agropoints, which raise the warrior to 33.<br />
A shaman slows the mob and cause 300 agropoints, and at the same time increase the warriors agro to 63.<br />
At the same time the cleric cast a heal and cause 50 agropoints to himself and 5 to the warrior.<br />
After the slow the wizards decides to cast a nuke that cause 300 agropoints to himself and 30 more to the warrior.<br />
All in all the warrior now has 98 agropoints and the chanter and shaman both have 300 agropoints.<br />
<br />
Here the skill helps the warrior alot.<br />
The skill gives the group the most benefit from keeping everyones agro high, but not higher than the warrior's.<br />
Its a really a fine walk on the line. :)<br />
<br />
The duration can probably not be adjusted much in order to balance it, simply because it would be hard to use it then, but the amount of agropoints that are transfered can easily be adjusted to make it balanced.<br />
The use of the same timer as defensive means it will have no use on the big boss mobs where defensive is needed, so the usage will be yard trash on raids and XPing in groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zukobim AB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I forgot to mention how it would be if it was related to a RL situation, so here it comes.<br />
<br />
Imagine 3 personers walking down the street and then one of them bump into a stranger.<br />
A big argument is rising and it comes to the point where a fight is starting.<br />
One of the smaller guys (could be a int caster in EQ) in the 3-man group throws a bottle at the stranger.<br />
When the stranger turns towards him, he starts to blame the biggest man (could be the warrior) in the 3-man group.<br />
The smaller guy says that the biggest of the 3 told him to throw the bottle and the biggest man agrees with the smaller guy.<br />
The stranger is still angry at the smaller guy.<br />
The last guy in the 3-man group now throws another bottle and the same thing happens, he blames the bigger guy in the group for telling him to do it and the bigger guy agrees again.<br />
<br />
Now imagine this happening with more people all blaming the same guy and that guy will agree with them all that he was the reason for the action.<br />
The stranger will be made at the one throwing the bottle and also at the one taking the blame, if the one taking the blame also throws a bottle then the stranger might be really pissed at him.</div></div><hr />
