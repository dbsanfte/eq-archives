<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Frax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">On my server there are currently 2 PoTime guilds (one is at the farm stage, clearing in a day, the other is in phase 5 i saw somewhere).  <br />
<br />
The guild I am in is making it's final push for PoTime,  and I'm curious how servers with 3 (or more) guilds in PoTime have worked out sharing the zone.  Any info on how the instancing works would be great as well.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Each guild gets their own instance of spawns. It is not a true instance in that you cannot both be in Time at the same time, but you can stagger your Time raid by a couple of days and have a pretty easy rotation. Once each guild can clear in 1 day, you could support as many as 6 guilds on a rotation without missing any Quarm repops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I thought there are only 2 instances of Time, or at least that's what it was.  Was it increased to be a higher number now?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zotha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Weve been running with 3 guilds (2 at quarm-farm status and 1 at rallos/inny) quite happily for several weeks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>brutall</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The easiest way to look at it.  The mobs in plane of time are instanced but the zone is not.  The timer for each instance starts when the first person from your raid clicks into time B.  While that timer is running you must be part of that raid to gain enterance to time B.  <br />
<br />
 time/phase<br />
1 hour-phase 1<br />
1 hour phase 2<br />
75 min phase 3<br />
4hours phase4<br />
4hours phsae 5<br />
2 hourse quarm<br />
13.15 hours total.<br />
<br />
If i fail to kill all mobs within the aloted time your timer will expire and the zone is ready for another guild to start immediatly.  If you clear phase 1 through 4 in 4 hours and gate out another guild will not be able to zone in for 11.25 hours.  Their is no way to end an instance early that i'm aware of.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Varf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">you can have up to 24 instances i belive... so *if* 24 guilds were fast enough you could have them each clear time once in a 5 day period (i think its is far from possable atm) <br />
this would mean a guild would have to clear everything in 5.5 hours and another guild right there and ready to start<br />
<br />
edit: my wonderful spelling</div></div><hr />

How could you know this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Varf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i have quite a few friends in time guilds, and a couple RL friends... i dont mind spoilers so i ask questions</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gallerus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">since there are no servers with 24+ time guilds I still fail to see how anyone could know what/if the limit is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly.  And if I was on a server with 24+ time guilds I would be filling out the server transfer paperwork asap hehe.</div></div><hr />

This leads me to believe that the Steel Warrior Mods are really nothing more than puppets who use their moderator status to cut down others in an attempt to make themselves feel more better about their sad and pathetic lives. <br />

I can't wait to be banned from this forum. Haas is the only cool person around here anyway. Too many sheep around here.</div></div><hr />

You can post what you want i the Outhouse - here though keep your drama and childish bullshit to yourself.<br />

If I'm a sheep because I try to keep this forum clean from random server drama and rambling on about who's penis is bigger - then baaaaaa.</div></div><hr />

yeah yeah :P   13th one is more of a loot pinata than anything tho :)</div></div><hr />

Going on day three of PoTime raiding and we have a nice arrangement worked out with the other two guilds.  Life is good!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>ODB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">3 Time guilds on Inny now, we've had a rotation for a month now. Started as a 4 on 4 off until my guild got there, then it was 4 / 4 / 4, for first rotation and now we do it as 3 / 3 / 3. Being newer to the zone, I'd have to say that it would be better off as 4 days but with 3, you try to make every minute really count. And I think that by being in there less keeps it fresher so you're not nored every time you go like I am sure some guilds feel about the zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Really, once you get Time down, 2 days is all you need to clear at a decent pace. One day clears are not that bad, but really, why bother. We only have 2 time guilds and we are on 4/4 rotation, but both guilds clear in 2 days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Timmok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">We currently rotate 2/2/2 on AB server. Not sure what we will do once a fourth guild enter time. <br />
<br />
A 2/2/2/2 rotation would mean less efficient farming(your instance would be fully spawned and idling before it was your turn again). <br />
<br />
Some of the guilds would have to switch to only getting 1 day to keep maximum efficiency.</div></div><hr />

<br />
  <br />
<br />
yeah yeah!<br />
<br />
Our rotation has worked out pretty well so far. The first guild has 1 day plus an option on a second, the second guild has 2 days plus an option on a 3rd, and we have 2 days plus the ability to use the other 2 guilds optional days while we are learning the zone.   A fourth guild in time would be.. ugh :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Tillaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Question about the instances and trials. Sorry if it's already been asked i did read all the other posts but yet to see it :)<br />
<br />
There is say 3 or 4 Guilds in Time already on my server they, however are all US based guilds.<br />
<br />
We are an off peak guild,  Is it possible for them to block us from time if they wanted to by killing the trials ? or do people not bother to kill the trials once they have passed them. Or when we zone into time at night do all the trials  reset for our own instance?<br />
<br />
As i understand it we shouldn't effect there ROT at all seeing as we start raiding 3 or 4 hours after they all stop raiding ?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Tarkas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">You'll never see phase 1 loot but you won't affect their rotation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Gromlok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">The trials reset in an hour, they can't keep them down.  They can not effect the &quot;instance&quot; that your guild is in, your guild has it's own timer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">we were basically thrown into the cold water, entering a 2/3 rotation, making it 2/2/2<br />
that resulted in us only seeing p1 p2 loot in the first 2 weeks with little p3 loot, but it helps your people to focus. I honestly dont see the point of 4/4/4 rotiations..</div></div><hr />
