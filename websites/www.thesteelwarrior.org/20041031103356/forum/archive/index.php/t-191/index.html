<br />
Unbuffed 1200ac/3600hp good enough assuming a slowed mob?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i'm not far off that ( ~1240Ac and 3700 hp's no-buffs ) and some guildies mentioned to me about being &quot;a bit small for there&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zhisz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Depends on your level - I could imagine a lvl 60 with 1300 ac / 4500 hp doing worse than a 65 with 1200 ac / 3800 hp. <br />
<br />
 That said, I noticed a good improvement in my tanking abilities once I got ~1300 ac.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Roma</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Unbuffed I'm sporting 3553 hps and 1253 ac at level 65 and most healers can keep up with me just fine :) <br />
<br />
Wandor... you're making a warrior now? lol silly wizard :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brokkah Narrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i felt like a liability at 3600hp 1150AC unbuffed at 61. Once I got to level 63 and 4khp/1250AC unbuffed I found it much easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">New warrior? Nah, just dusting off the old dorf. I hadn't had the time to play him since prePoP and when I finally did decide to play him again I had a brain fart and let the account get hacked :(<br />
<br />
After spending weeks working on my giant faction I was finally able to MQ some Warlord's for ol' Moordian so I figured now was as good a time as any to start playing him again. He has been stellar in camping SoL, I usually use him to camp shard that require a tank and Ssra emp ring pieces. He hasn't had any problems tanking the Taskmasters or those damn annoying Rubble Rouser in AR.<br />
<br />
He's also had an easy time with tier one stuff including the hobgoblins in PoN and he even managed to do the tanking duties to get through the Exec trial so I figured I would try to get him leveled and geared enough to tank in PoV so I can at least get decent exp on Wandor while I level Moordian up.<br />
<br />
I know he is not quite there yet, sitting at 3250hp/1160ac unbuffed but I figure he will be topping out at 3600/1225 when I finish getting his current batch of upgrades.<br />
<br />
I know he has adequate gear to tank there once he is 60+ with some AAs, but I want to get him there as soon as possible without being too much of a burden on the cleric. The sooner I can get him PoV ready, the faster I can get 65 and start working AAs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I started tanking in PoV at 61 with about 4khps and 1200AC and in groups with a cleric and either a shaman or beastlord that would buff up to around 6.5k which was plenty for tanking.  With just a cleric I was sitting around 5.4k which can make things a little loose.<br />
<br />
I think level of the cleric, your ability to maintain agro and the skill of the groups slower are all as important as your max hps.<br />
<br />
Currently I have 2 characters I am XPing with in PoV, a warrior (ding overlord last night) and a 64 enchanter.  My girlfriend plays a 65 SK.<br />
<br />
Heres a few of my observations~<br />
<br />
With the SK tanking (she has about 3khps unbuffed, so usually sits between 4.5k and 5.5k hps depending on the group make up) as a chanter I can land slows on incoming and not draw agro, this means that she rarely ever has to tank unslowed mobs (mad FD skillz so always single pulls).<br />
<br />
As a warrior tanking I usually have to tank an unslowed mob for a bit longer, but the extra hps mean this isnt really a problem.  With either shaman or bst buffs and a good cleric Ive had plenty of groups run smoothly with slows not landing on mobs till half way through the fight.<br />
<br />
Couple of things to add  tho, if you are light on HPs and there isnt a Shaman or BST to buff you probably want the cleric to be above 60.  At 60 and below the pre-PoP quick heals dont have the bang for buck when things go pear shaped.<br />
<br />
Really your ability to control agro will be the defining part of how well you tank in PoV.  Extra HPs are nice for when the cleric has to land a quick heal on the chanter meaning the CH for you will be coming in late, but if you can manage to keep the mobs on you at all times this shouldnt be an issue, and if the cleric only needs to focus on keeping the tank up and not healing the rest of the group then even 5khps buffed will see you right.<br />
<br />
For tanking I had a rogue parsing tell me that my 2 hander (epic 36/41) was out damaging my FG/Red Blade combo, and I definitely noticed it was easier to hold the mobs attention with the 2 hander.  <br />
<br />
~<br />
<br />
Drivel really, but hope theres some useful info in there~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Raunstonecutter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think to do well in PoV, you need to be level 61, have an AC over 1100 unbuffed, and atleast 3600hps, preferable with some natural durabilities.  I only get 1200AC when I get buffs, just not getting the drops to get my AC that high yet.<br />
<br />
Healer and buffs play an important role.  Though at 63, I can roll in with minimal buffs (5700hps) and do just fine.  Get the best you can and hope for the best.<br />
<br />
I agree though, over all, its your agro control which will help you the most.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Smakz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">i found that for me, at 61 with 3600hp unbuffed i got owned. when i broke 4k unbuffed at 61 i was fine.<br />
<br />
I dont recommend going to PoV till you have at least 4k unbuffed, cause you cant be sure if you'll have a shammy or not.<br />
<br />
If you can build your own group to go in, sure, its alot easier with less than 4k, but i stand behind myself when i say 4k is a minimum for pick up groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>KradikIronheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Bout to be flagged, Just curious how soon i should be working on HoH and BoT keys.  Currently i'm a lvl 60 w/ 1200 ac and 3600 hps.  Wait for lvls? or  Tag along w/ the higher ups?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">i can see the arguments for trying to get 4khp unbuffed before heading to PoV.<br />
<br />
However, with all the parses done with AC, is there really much difference in going to pov with 1200 ac unbuffed and 1300 ac unbuffed?<br />
<br />
Atm im about 3700 hp unbuffed but getting a few upgrades in the next week will take me to 4khp. However, i have sacrificed a bit of ac for Hp so my AC hovers at around 1190 atm. With a bit of swopping around i can get it up a little, but normally with buffs it can get close to 1300. <br />
<br />
I would have thought if you had some aaxp in ND, CA and CS that would make more of a difference than 100 ac.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>tarsk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Without looking at my Magelo, I don't remember what my AC is (I don't look at it that much).. I know it's not stellar though. Everything went fine once I broke the 4K unbuffed hp mark though. CS helps more than a bit, too ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sarelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I started tanking in PoV at 59 with about 4.2k hps and close to 1200 AC unbuffed, no AA's. It was hard but I made 62 in less than a week and then it got a lot easier.<br />
<br />
<br />
Levels&gt;All.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>proteg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I am level 62 with around 3650 hps/1190AC unbuffed and was borderline-liability Tanking west in PoV.  There were one or two fights where the initial aggro building was a bit puse-raising.  <br />
<br />
When I got cs2 in the middle of the night I immediately was no longer borderline.  Building aggro was never an issue after that as far as me being able to stay alive.  I also have nd2 so Buffed I am around 6.2k hps.  <br />
<br />
This setup is what I feel is minimal.  (With cs3 you can have less hps without even cs1 you would be toast with my hps, etc etc.  Adjust accordingly)<br />
<br />
The most important factor tho may be the Shammy Agi buff.  When it dropped midfight one time the Cleric asked me if Virt faded.  <br />
<br />
In all reality there are WAY WAY WAY too many factors including peripheral stats , level, aa's, group skills and makeup, that basing Tankability solely on hps/ac is pretty inacurate.  <br />
<br />
It is a good starting point tho.  <br />
<br />
(In light of the agi revelation I have been upgrading rings and stuff trying to eek out a bit more, and the results have been positive)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gnomb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I started at 61 and 23 AA in PoV back when virtue was a darn rare spell and was around 4500 hp and ~1200 AC unbuffed.<br />
With resisted slows it was sometimes still very close.<br />
<br />
Get some upgrades for neck, waist and shoulder slot (send me a tell for some suggestions) and you should be fine.<br />
It will still depend a lot on other factors like level of your healer (what spells does he have), slower and/or crowd control.<br />
Just had a level 60 chanter in Tactics the other day whose only form of CC was root park due to not having the spells available.<br />
For myself the breaking point was after getting CA 3 and starting on the LR line (i had like RS 3, Regen3, ND 3,AE Taunt, CA1, CS 1, CF 1, PE, PD3, Ingenuity1, CA 3, TM1, LR 5, SE 1, CS 3, ID 1),  <br />
of course damage taken had sometimes a few spikes but the increased avoidance was well worth it.<br />
I cannot say i felt the same increase from getting CS 3 over CS 1 but i will recheck once i have ID5.<br />
After getting CA 3 i never again considered 2h weapons for riposte issues.<br />
Maybe I'd talk different when we had more luck on getting some decent 2h weapons to drop but on our only Lord Vyemm kill the Gaudralek went to another warrior and so far no Norgetal or similar weapon(and of course no 2hs from lord inquisitor seru yesterday).<br />
And buying weaponry isnt really an option, just burned my last cash getting to 156 smithing for the seru bane combine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kendolekk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I have watched my HP go from 3500 to 4500+ unbuffed since I have been in PoV. Starting out, at 60 w/ 3500hp, I had a rough time tanking. I HAD to have shammy buffs and they had to land slow asap.<br />
<br />
Once I got 4k+ it got ALOT smoother.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>rolsdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I was around 1200ac/3600hp's at lvl 62 when i started tankin in POV its defineately doable, and once the mob is slowed you shouldnt have a problem at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Brudal the Fat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I think a good rule would be to have at least 5500hp buffed for pov group tanking. Anything less can be done but you will run your cleric oom fast.</div></div><hr />

&quot;a bit small for there&quot;  <br />

That's because you are a half-elf though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Not to mention the cleric would end up tanking the mob due to heal aggro.<br />
<br />
I would say at the minumum you would need 5500hp, 6k would be even better since you take about of 1k dmg per combat round.  Especially if you have no defensive AAs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
naah, more like 3 levels and 50+ aa's lacking on the next smallest tank in my old guild....don't make me punt you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">shik link your guilds website.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Gnomb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">He is right on the levels, but wrong on the AA's.<br />
Truelove, Haledan, Zampo and Rolsdar dont have 50 AA yet.<br />
No warrior in guild except Plod breaks 100 AA's at all mostly because most of us got 60 only a few months or less before PoP.<br />
<br />
And the guild link is in my sig.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Tagmwar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I exp alot on pov, level 60  1392 ac 4173 hps.. I am the defensive warrior for our small guild, 48 total AA's all defensive so far. <br />
<br />
I have 0 problems tank in pov. <br />
<br />
I do not think AC and HPS are the only concern, even with less ac and less hps if you have the AA's to back it up.. U should do ok, Get in a group and tank a mob.. If your crumbling every other blow then your not ready.  <br />
<br />
Crumbling = getting hit on a normaly for close to max dmg and not many misses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Smohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I started in POV at lvl 63 and noticed everything got easier as I went from lvl 64 then to 65. AT 63 I was getting owned - needed chain CH's a fight (was duoing with a cleric) but at lvl 65 the cleric was up and meleeing and having tons of mana without medding.<br />
<br />
My AC/HP then was about 1250 and 4700 unbuffed.<br />
<br />
For a full group - I'd say that lvl 61, ac 1250, and HP about 4k would do the trick.<br />
