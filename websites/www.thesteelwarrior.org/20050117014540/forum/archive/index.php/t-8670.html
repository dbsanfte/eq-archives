Now in order to do the quests shall I buy a bunch of Human potions since my warrior is Ogre? <br />
Next question is can my necro main take all the mobs from here on out since I got the ashes part completed?<br />
<br />
I duo'd the Vamp with another necro and was quite easy.  I think I could of solo'd him.  All I did was kill every thing in the castle and kept it cleared.  No trick just luck=)<br />

<br />
Not sure about Iksar, but I did it with human illusion potion to start the first hail and from then was able to finish without any illusion.  I think the main thing is whether or not you have a deity.  I do not, but if you do then I'm 99.9% sure you gonna have to do some faction work.<br />
<br />
As far as whether it's soloable by a 65 necro, I would venture to say yes.  Every fight up until the last one (for the vamp ashes) is terribly gimp, probably soloable by a good warrior.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lidan</div><div class="date">08-28-2004, 12:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe I have a horror story about Heratus.  I spent ooh I'd say the greater part of 5 hours killing there with a bard friend and a nice clr who was bored and offered to help.  We finally got HG to spawn and we took him down with ease.  Then, Valdanov spawned.  So clr is still pretty good on mana and I knew we would need to engage soon or else he would despawn.  The bard had a charmed pet that quadded for 200 because I gave him vamp stakes.  I end up dieing because lifetap hit me at just the wrong time.  The bard takes him outside and starts kiting him and I eventually get rezzed.  Then, we proceed to kite him outside.  We spend a good 30min just kiting him.  This mother fucker decides he has just enough mana for a gate.  We had gotten him to 9% and he gates on us.  Now I am getting really pissed.  I died, he gated and then to top it all off in ohh mabye 5 seconds he goes from 9% to 100%.  Now that really pissed me off.  So then I call in reinforcements, GoD/Time geared Mage and a 65 druid with his 55 shm 2box.  So the bard keeps training Valdanov to zone to keep him from despawning.  Then, we fight our way to the top.  Hmmm, Valdanov despawns right in my face.  RIGHT IN MY FACE.  I had just targeted him to pull and he despawns.  Well, I gave up for that day.  I still have yet to get HG again, but I am extreamly pissed off at those vampyres so I cant wait to kill Valdanov and all his little henchmen again and again and again.  Well thats my story, I hope you guys enjoy yourselves on my suffering.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pig</div><div class="date">08-29-2004, 11:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">All I can say is keep him slowed... did him easy twice with a warr/clr 2-box and<br />
a shammy/sk 2-box.  Pass around stakes to everyone &amp; pets, let yer cleric<br />
just use his summoned hammer or VZ hammer, and u gtg.  Hard part is keeping<br />
yourselves awake till HG spawns.<br />
<br />
Necro's prob solo him easy =(<br />
<br />
With agnostic warr was able to do the whole quest except the mage part in<br />
Katta where u have to fight the robed guy that attacks u after the katta<br />
mages interrogate him...  Had to use wood-elf illusion crown and kept my<br />
kos cleric outside at max range to spam a heal if needed.<br />
<br />
60ac back item w/ldon aug is hard for me to replace.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Balfamor</div><div class="date">09-02-2004, 01:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's the &quot;Concillium Universus&quot; faction that you want to raise.  Killing vampires in TM or normal guards in Sanctus Seru won't raise this faction.  You either need to kill guards in the &quot;Heart&quot; house of Sanctus Seru, or do specific quests in Katta.<br />

Had the other four named mobs pop 3-4 times each I'd say, but no HG.  Yeesh.  How long is this freaking camp?   :mad:  Not only that, but no drops off any of the other named mobs, just a ton of coterie crap.  Ok, I know the shield rocks and is worth it, but gah.</div></div><hr />

Long long ago I killed Nathyn.  Will that one kill drag me down to KoS? or are there mobs I can kill to raise my faction?<br />
