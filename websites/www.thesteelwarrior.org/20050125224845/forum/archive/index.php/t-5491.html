<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yebhx</div><div class="date">02-02-2004, 03:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I used to play alot on rallos with my rl friends but they all had to quit for some reason or another so I went to check out Stormhammer for the gm events mostly (and a break from pvp, omg pvp sucks if you are relying on no drop one group doable gear). Luckily My friends had very successful pk alts and I inherited thier droppables when they quit, so upon arrival to SH I was able to upgrade my gear alot with baz bought/traded items. But I have run out of sellable gear and now seem to be at kind of a dead end gear wise. Is LDoN my only source for gear now? Any advice would be appreciated. Oh yeah and my katta faction is max kos from leveling there for a while so the nice back/shield is probably out for me also unless anyone knows an effective place to improve katta faction solo.</div></div><hr />
