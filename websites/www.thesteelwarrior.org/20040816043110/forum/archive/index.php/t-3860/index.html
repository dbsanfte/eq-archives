<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mofu-Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I would like to see pure melee classes haveing an inate haste of 60% (due to focused training). The haste cap would remain the same but with a 40% haste item the pure melee classes would never be less than 100% haste. I cant see how this would have any overpowering effect in a raid or group , but it would help us solo if we cant find a group , and it could help us hold aggro against mobs that dispell your buffs.<br />
<br />
 The second idea is a bit out there but i like it ;) . Pure melee would be able to enter any populated area and &quot;attract a follower&quot; it would be similar in power to the top SK pet. Since pure melee can do very little in the way of buffing i think they should get the same &quot;follower&quot; each time they use the ability. The advantage to this is that all that no drop gear cluttering up your bank could be given to the &quot;follower&quot;. Weapons, armor , ,haste item  whateva, makeing them helpful to a pure melee soloing or adding some dps if grouped. <br />
<br />
 While this might not address many of the problems that plague todays pure melee classes , I think it would help reduce the frustration of playing the LFG game, which can and does suck. I dont pay to play EQ so i can sit on my ass waiting for someone to take pity on me. This way i could at least solo somewhat effectivly while waiting for a group. <br />

A pet for pure melees um ok thats never going to happen like that.<br />
<br />
People keep complaining about lfging but I have never had probs getting groups.  /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zilden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I was hoping for an AA ability that had haste. something like natural durablitity. lvl 1 2% haste, lvl 2 5% haste, lvl 3 10% haste.<br />
This would help with agro and wouldnt be to over powering.</div></div><hr />
