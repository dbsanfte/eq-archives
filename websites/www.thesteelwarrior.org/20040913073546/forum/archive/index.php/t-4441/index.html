<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mephistophilis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I would just like to say thank you to everyone on the forums for their helpful advice regarding equipment, general strategies, parsing, etc.  It has helped me tremendously with my main warrior.<br />
<br />
I am a casual gamer, level 50.  Thanks to advice including weapons that proc (I picked up a SotB and a GSoT for later), agro tests with misses, and the like I have become much more efficient at controlling MOBs.<br />
<br />
I was doing a HARD LDoN last night with an over-nuking wizzy, a beast, a cleric, an enchanter, and a shaman and I managed to hold agro very well.  The cleric gave me much praise for being an &quot;awesome tank.&quot;  I felt pride for the first time in a long time for being a warrior.<br />
<br />
The thanks should go to everyone here.</div></div><hr />
