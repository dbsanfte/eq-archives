<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>brutall</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been thinking about the warrior problem and how it relates to other classes and the game as a whole.  Its painfully obvious that at this point they can't give us a significant hitpoint increase without totally trivializing everything.  Midigation is an option but its just like messing with hitpoints.<br />
<br />
So here it is.....<br />
<br />
Give warriors the ability to use heals more effectivly.  A 10 percent bonus on every heal that's cast on a warrior innate self ability to utilize heals more effectivly than any other class.  Works just like healing adept(see cleric aa skills).<br />
<br />
Remember the creator cast a balance that made heals 50% less effective?  The code is already in game to do this.  Please let me know what you think about this below.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Slashy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Give Warriors a &quot;Mana Bar&quot;. Everytime you hit Taunt, you will add 450 pure Hate to your target and decrease your &quot;Mana Bar&quot;. Recycle time of Taunt key is 2 ticks.  Lev 65 Warriors will have a bigger &quot;Mana Pool&quot; to use Taunt than lev 50 Warriors. It increases while you level.<br />
<br />
Examples:<br />
<br />
Lev 1 Warrior can use Taunt 5 times before his Bar is empty for a total of 50 Hate per Taunt. <br />
Lev65 Warrior can use Taunt 10 times before his Bar is empty for a total of 450 Hate per Taunt. <br />
<br />
Just some numbers to play with.<br />
<br />
Things like Voice of Thule (SK agro buff) will help regen that Bar faster. KEI/FT etc however will not. Remove Taunt ability for everyone else. IF SK/Pal wants to agro, they will have to use their Agro spells.  Increase Mana cost/casting time/recycle time  on these so a Paldadin can no longer cast his lev9 stun forever to keep agro  =&gt; More Balance.<br />
<br />
Give Warriors a 15-20% innate Damage Mitigation Bonus and remove the pitful /disc defense command. And not through more AXP. It should be a cornerstone of the Warrior class to OUTTANK ANYONE. Infact, go and review all Warrior discs. We are a defensive class. Think about that. No one is using mighty/Fellstrike/aggresive etc. In fact, i think the last time i used Fellstrike was to score some neat Cripples for the Screenshot section at the time VT was the HighEnd Zone.<br />
<br />
Make Echo of Anger a click ability (insta click) that you want to use IF you want agro. Not the entire time you swing a sword. Passive agro tools = bad imo. Add more Agro Focus items for the Warrior class. Look at the reign of Caster Focus items. All that melee get is basically Vengeance and Regen. (Dont start on Time mods like Accuracy etc). (Course, Hybrids get the best of both worlds again, with no penalties to my knowledge, again)<br />
<br />
Everytime you get an Item which is Warrior usable but has + Mana on it, convert it to HP or AC if worn by pure melee. Maybe 3 Mana = 1 HP. So a 100 HP/Mana Item would be 133 HP 0 Mana in the hands of a Warrior. Nothing pisses me of more than a WAR/PAL/SK/BARD/CLE item with 125HP/MANA because as a pure melee I only get the 125HP and everyone else gets 125 HP AND 125 Mana for the same amount of DKP/ADV Points or whatever.<br />
(Maybe 4Mana/Hp for Rog/Monks ...)<br />
<br />
Just what comes to my mind browsing the Boards at work :)<br />
<br />
SK and Pals (maybe Monks next) should be absolutely impossible as tanks for Quarm. They should be crushed. End of story.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Injektilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">While i think it is a good idea brutall, all that will do is make it so you can raid with less clerics.  Paladins and SK will still be able to tank quarm, nothing will change that, making it easier to heal warriors would be nice, but its not something that will give us our role back, unless the clerics go on strike and your pulling like 7 active for time.<br />
<br />
There needs to be something more, or something less for the knight classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Is it really reasonable to have to healer zerg near end game fights with 10 Clerics and 6 Druids?<br />
<br />
Why when a Paladin MT's can't it be about something different than beef?<br />
<br />
Why when a Druid has a critical raid role is it Rampage Tank healing rotation or spam the MT on Beserk?<br />
<br />
The real problem is that SoE itself is too attached to the MT and healer model so that when Knights are improved it's to make them more Warrior-like and when Druids are improved more Cleric-like.<br />
