<br />
Would anyone mind giving me some information about these 6 raid trials?<br />
<br />
Gonna give them a shot in the weeks to come and some reading would be nice.<br />
<br />
Please email me at shaffer0420@hotmail.com or chris.shaffer@hopkinscountyjail.com<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kinathin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you beat them all, you're keyed for Angusih............hope that helped!!!! muahahaha</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dags</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">haha yea :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thalzaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">No one is really gonna give you walkthroughs to the trials just yet.  They are still new and being tweaked a little still. Unless you have some good friends in high level places that would hook ya up, i doubt you'll find any spoilers here just yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dags</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Makes sence, thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Velle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I seriously doubt uguys can do any of these trials yet. Uguys haven't beaten uqua + and not even RS queen or king. Tanks need to be equipped fairly well here to survive these trials (not just tanks pretty much everyone). Correct me if I'm wrong. I'm not trying to discourage ur guild for trying these trials, however I don't think it's your league yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dags</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Your right Velle, we havent beaten Uqua yet, or RS Queen or King.  We did Chailak with 41 and clear time in 1 day.<br />
<br />
It's most likely a beyond us.  But we are close to getting into Qvic and just wanted to give it a go at least once to see where we stand.<br />
<br />
I also figured that if I had some strats it would help some even if it's a month or so down the road before we can even realistically have any chance at it at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Chailak isn't anything, honestly. King is a lot easier now than he was, you should give him a try.<br />
<br />
As far as strats go, the only real difficulty lies in figuring them out.  I'm sure people here would give you some pointers if you had tried and failed them a time or two and wanted some advice  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">simon says &amp; PVP = not very gear based</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Dags</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Good point Raaj.  Thank you folks for the responses.  We'll give this a go and if I have some questions you all can lend a hand.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks again everyone,<br />
<br />
Dags.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Velle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">aye one trial (pvp) isnt much gear based, however some class (won't say which one) won't let ur casters sit and med. Need to react quick! We failed twice before winning this one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>issu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">simon says &amp; PVP = not very gear based<br />
<br />
