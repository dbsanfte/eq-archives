<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>BabaHanz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok everyone, I just won a Belt of Mastery from VT, which I am thrilled about.  The problem is that it replaces my Soulscream Belt, which is my sole source of haste.  The only cash I have is what I will make from selling the belt.  I'm thinking either trade it for a SBC or get the LDON helm and haste aug, even though I already have an ornate helm.  Any other suggestions?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Evariste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It's too bad you already have that helmet.  <br />
<br />
I say: camp an item, Bazaar it, and snag a Cloak of Flames. If you can't do this, get a Zerker cloak. <br />
<br />
Or, you can dump for tribute haste and hold over until a higher piece comes your way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Debbin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">you can get the haste aug, type 3 into a cloak, cant tell what you have atm, as magelo is down<br />
<br />
Cloak of the Lost Oasis<br />
AC:14, Sta:9, Mana:50, HP:80, CR:10, MR:11, type1,type2,type3 <br />
from tak for 1492<br />
<br />
there are others, just have to find em</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I went hasteless for a few weeks cause I didn't want to replace my Icy Shadows Cloak with a CoF, but looking back, should of done it. Grab the belt, bag it untill you get a haste. Best belt untill potime.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hard LDoN drops a nice haste cloak (Miraguls?).<br />
<br />
Also could take 10 friends and kill Yelinak (not sure what your Tormax faction is) for the gloves...same with POI dragon for its neck (though rareish drop)<br />
<br />
And then again there are the haste drops from within VT itself....<br />
<br />
I'm fairly certain you'll have an answer to your problem presented fairly quickly :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>KoGuiN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">&quot;Best belt untill potime.&quot;<br />
<br />
There's the belt from rock ring in earth that is better than this one :)<br />
But good belt nonetheless</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>BabaHanz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Was thinking about the GoDS, more AC and stats, 15 less hp than my myrmidions.  Will have to faction alot though, as my &quot;faction with King Tormax could not possibly get any worse.&quot;  Thanks for the replies everyone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Friedrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Get a solid group and do hard LDON's in Everfrost, cloak has 17ac, 90hps, 36% haste, and minor stats.<br />
<br />
Fried</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well I wouldn't spend big money on a haste item, when you should be able to get a 41% haste item in VT rather easily.  Then again if your guild can kill in VT you should be able to gank yelnik with no problems.  He drops 2 41% haste items everytime, the neck and the head for the gaunts of dragonslaying.<br />
<br />
In the meantime you can use tribute haste.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>hemorrhagern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">tribute haste don't seem its working like it was before  the patch don't know about after 3/11 patch tho</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Crystara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Belt of Mastery is better then Girdle of Earthen Stability, I'd take 17ac over 15hp any day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">good chance his guild is cothing past the tvx twins. if not, they each can drop up to 3 haste items each. there is BP of speed, other than the front tvx twins and that item, think you are out of luck in VT.<br />
<br />
ive done many hard everfrost ldons, never seen that cloak, is it purchaseable or youve seen it drop?.<br />
<br />
i think there is a link with all available haste items in the library (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=14), prob seb cloak or cloak of flames is your best bet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Asharad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I wear a dreadscale cloak.  It drops off Inny in Nadox.  A pretty easy encounter if you can get a couple of groups together, and superior to the CoF.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I have seen the haste cloak drop in Hard LDoN twice.  It is no drop I believe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>BabaHanz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Dunno where we CotH to...from zone in, we CotH to blob1, but they say we do a full clearing /shrug  I've cleared VT 4 times now, have seen 0 BP of speed drops and 1 Gorget of Superiorty drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>turkishbull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I believe there is a 36% augment that drops in GOD that is type 7 and fits in almost all slots.....you can try and find that one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">There is also a 36% any-type waist-slot augment found in chests in hard LDON... saw one in Rujark.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Nilana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I have been using tribute haste for my haste item for about 2 weeks now.  I just recently upgraded my BP (which was my haste) to the AHR BP.  I have not had any trouble with the tribute haste that I have noticed.  It can get alittle expensive but I would rather go this route then lose the stats from one of my items to go to a lower hp haste item.  Just my 2cp on the subject.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">/wave Nilana, I agree I ran the Tribute haste for a few days, while in the middle of switching between old items and upgrades. It ran nicely, I found no conflicts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">no u arent doing a full clearing, the front 2 tvx twins drop 3 items a piece and its just as good loot as any mob in zone for the most part.<br />
<br />
admittedly most guilds do coth to blob1 cause you really add onto your clearing time otherwise, esp for 1 day clearings.  when we did 2 day clearings, we would usually knock them out though. you can check out this link (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=8778) to see what you are missing though. if you arent farming elementals yet, you are missing out on 6 good items. i wouldnt bother if you were in elementals myself tho.<br />
<br />
3 haste items on each tvx, worth doing imo if your guild is missing haste, and the other stuff isnt bad.</div></div><hr />
