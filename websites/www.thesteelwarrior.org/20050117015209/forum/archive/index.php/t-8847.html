<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Roorni</div><div class="date">09-09-2004, 05:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi I just dinged 65 recently and have had a hard time getting goups.  Was wondering if you could offer some advice on my armor and weapons?  Magelo is pretty much current.  and all my weapons are in the top two bags, side to side.  <br />
<br />
ALso have a question about holding aggro when the mob is slowed.  I seem to lose aggro after the slows land, and have to hurry to get it back.  Is there a way to prevent this.<br />
<br />
As for armor, I have been doing the adv to get the armor from there, since my guild has lately been through many difficult changes and are just getting back to raiding again.  So far I have the most points in EF but have heard that the Nro armor is better.<br />
Hate to sound dumb or ebayed(which I am not)  but I am really bad with the abbrevations for most of the weapons.  So if you can put the hole name for me.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your time and answers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Other gear looks good, get those hp and defensive aa's!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">09-09-2004, 08:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">lol DELETE the staff :D .. that makes me laugh for some odd reason. <br />
<br />
not bag the staff, bank the staff...DELETE the staff. <br />
<br />
but yeah, gear and weapons are fine. go get some aa's</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Roorni</div><div class="date">09-10-2004, 01:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the advice.  Working on the aa's have gotten 2 tonight so far.  I was using the staff on raid to get 2h skill up and I was not the MT.  Usually have the swords equipped.<br />
<br />
Thanks again!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redleaf</div><div class="date">09-10-2004, 05:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I suggest the following:<br />
<br />
2x Earring of Engagement<br />
Get rid of that neck item and get something with some AC and hps on it, the Amulet of Mummy Wrappings is an excellent cheap item, its 12 ac and 45 hps IIRC.<br />
You could also farm a Flawless Steel facemask from SG.  Its the same AC as what you have, but it also has 55 or so hps.<br />
<br />
Then...I suggest doing LDoN to upgrade your armor slots.  I suggest doing EF and getting the armor from there.  While the NRO armor is better, it seems that EF would give you better bang for your buck.  NRO is good if you need to upgrade one or two slots.  EF is good if you need to upgrade a lot of slots.  Also, by doing EF advs you will get the points for Anger Augs.<br />
