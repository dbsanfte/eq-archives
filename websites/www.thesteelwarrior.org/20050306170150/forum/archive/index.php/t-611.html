<br />
My question is simple!  Are you still having fun?<br />
<br />
I LOOOOOOOVE being a warrior, even with the inherent flaws.  What isn't to love when you are getting pounded on by a quadding a trash mob with 1400 hits and you can survive a whole fight of four mobs like that in a row without using defensive or evasive?  Maybe a pally or SK could have survived it, but I doubt it would have been mana efficient for the clerics.</div></div><hr />

Am i uber ? Yes<br />
Is my gear &amp; AA the reason i enjoy EQ ? YES<br />
<br />
Would i enjoy EQ without that gear ? NO<br />
Was i having fun when i wasnt uber ? NO<br />
Do i enjoy a 65 pal pulling a mob off me after 3 BoW procs ? NO<br />
Do non uber wars enjoy themselves ? NO<br />
<br />
Lets face it.....<br />
3 paladin nukes &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 3 BoW procs. Thats just wrong.<br />
Paladin pulling with stun  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1 BoW proc <br />
<br />
I cant even imagine how the &quot;average&quot; war feels.<br />
<br />
As depending on gear as a junkie on drugs.<br />
As usefull to a group as an empty slot.<br />
<br />
As we gear up, warriors become more viable.<br />
But unless your very very very high in that ladder, your just a waste of group space.<br />
You cant agro shit, you cant DPS, and a pal/sk with 500-1000 less<br />
hp will get the tanking done 100 times better than you.<br />
<br />
Uber war = Godly<br />
High lvl war = Great<br />
<br />
Normal war01 = Waste of group space, Xp leech.<br />
<br />
Thats the problem VI hasnt seen.<br />
<br />
Ps : Yes i am having fun. Both in raids &amp; in every day EQlife.</div></div><hr />

In the same ways that your pallys &amp; sks dont &amp; cant tank those mobs, warriors in lesser guilds have similar jobs to fill - they need to tank mobs like vindi, etc.  I bet back pre-sol you enjoyed tanking vindi &amp; stuff like that.<br />
<br />
The way I see it, pallys &amp; sks have some mobs they were meant to tank (low dps mobs with high damage aes with small ranges for instance), where warriors have mobs they were meant to tank (high dps mobs).<br />
<br />
I bet if you asked pallys &amp; sks before they sol (hp/emp especially) &amp; pop encounters how much fun they had the answer was something along the lines of &quot;do I enjoy tanking much worse than a warrior ? no&quot;, etc.<br />
<br />
Everyone has a job to do &amp; complaining about agro doesnt change that imo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
However, to be a warrior right now is so increadibly frustrating that it isn't fun. <br />
<br />
It doesn't mean I want to quit, because I have the warrior attitude. <br />
<br />
However, there are times when I have been nearly brought to tears out of frustration over not being able to get a group anywhere  because I am a warrior. This is a game, it should be fun.  Yet every time I log in, there is someone to sit there and tell me not to tank because the knight 3 levels below me in the same level of gear is gonna tank, and thats if I get in a group. How is that fun?<br />
<br />
I have fun when I can tank and no one dies do to taking my agro. I have fun when I don't have to shout for 3 hours in several different zones and my guild for a group only to be told that they want a knight. I have fun when I am allowed to play just like everyone else.<br />
<br />
Why is it wrong to expect the game to be fun for all classes?</div></div><hr />

<br />
So at least we know if our ideas are valid.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ps: Yes gallerus, but MTing &quot;raid mobs&quot; isnt the average EQ life.<br />
Even for hardcore raiders such as some others &amp; you &amp; me.<br />
<br />
EQ life is xp groups. Hardcore raiders are a minority.<br />
Most hardcore raiders have the stuff to be happy (see EB)<br />
Most hardcore raiders do guild only groups.</div></div><hr />

I have NO FUN AT ALL when I don't hold aggro on 1 pull on 2, when I don't know why this time I got no aggro whatever I do and the same pull 2 mins later the mob is glued on me...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lelara</div><div class="date">05-13-2003, 02:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey Hulanta,<br />
<br />
I'm kind of on the same page with you.<br />
<br />
Yeah, I've read/heard what our class can/can't do yada yada yada but I still play my character cause I love her.<br />
<br />
I remember my first time MTing King Tormax from start to finish was soooo exciting.<br />
<br />
I may be fortunate too cause I have good guildmates and we do things together.<br />
<br />
Even though taunt doesn't work (or does it? I don't know), we can't solo that well, knight classes do better in exp groups or whatever the problem is with our class, I just adepted to it and tried to make the best of it.<br />
<br />
My only peeve is that being a babarian female is kind of amusing. Thanks to new graphic models when Luclin came out, my.....chest size seems &quot;different&quot; than the old graphics and I get &quot;hit on&quot; from time to time. It can get annoying but as I said earlier, I'll just adept to it.<br />

They're stubborn as hell.   But that alone isn't enough to make the game 'fun'.<br />
<br />
I stopped having fun when they introduced PoP where the mobs are so significantly on steriods that slow is a MUST and losing aggro for a round or two usually results in either a squashed caster or vasts amounts of mana blown out the wazoo.  They took all our advantages and made them useless, because once slowed almost anyone can tank a PoP mob, and they took our biggest weakness, lack of aggro control, and emphasized the need for it to the sky.  We've gone from being the number 1 choice to being a, well if we can't find a Knight and you guys are really careful, maybe the Warrior will be okay to tank....<br />
<br />
Sorry, being a Warrior just isn't fun when it's so obvious that there really is no benefit to dealing with our screwed up aggro control anymore.  And hell, we can't even go solo when we can't find a group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Binnamar</div><div class="date">05-13-2003, 03:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm just bored with the class. I raid a lot (not uber raiding but things like Doomshade, RC, Xenemech, and going to try NToV soon) and am low down on the tank chain. So most of my time I am just assisting a tank and doing shitty dps... Kinda wishing I made a rogue. I'm too lazy to start over.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh well thats why I don't enjoy my warrior as much as another class, but I'm still enjoying the game.</div></div><hr />

It sounds simple - but a lot of people have problems doing it. If you aren't having fun, go do something that IS fun. The game will be there.</div></div><hr />

When EQ turned into more of a job than a game, that's when it became unfun.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The trouble being that it very hard to get beat on without being able to taunt worth beans. Which leaves me being sub-par DPS in a group that could make better use of someone else. Luckilly I only group with guildies. Alot of tanks don't have this option.<br />
<br />
They can add more high end weapons that 99% of players will never see, but it won't fix the fundamental problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frax</div><div class="date">05-13-2003, 03:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why am I not having fun?<br />
<br />
This game has not truly progressed in the 'fun' department in 2+ years.  Velious, Luclin, PoP, and LoY have really been nothing but milking the EQ cash cow for Sony.   There is very little of interest in any of these other than the almighty loot.  Every fight still boils down a question of 'is our &quot;X&quot; healing power enough to keep &quot;Y&quot; amount of DPS alive to kill mob &quot;Z&quot;?'  Add some amount of &quot;X&quot; or &quot;Y&quot; and you can always defeat &quot;Z&quot; in this game.   Challenging for EQ now consists of the same but extended to a 3 hour duration like the Rathe Council event that has been all over the uber guild pages the last two weeks.  No thanks, three hours of eye bleeding events for 2 or 3 items is just a incredibly sick outcome for 70 people to have to deal with.  The absolute worst feature of EQ is the limitation of uber loot to rare mobs in uber zones which are heavly competed for.<br />
<br />
The warrior class itself hasn't changed much since that day in january of 1999 when I popped the black and white beta CD into my computer and experienced Everquest for the first time.  Sure there have been a few tweaks (HP upgrades in 1999 &amp; 2000, AAs,  and massive gear upgrades in the last 3 expansions, and our class was the test for quested armor with crafted), but all in all,  Frax looks like the same character to me that I played in Blackburrow 4 years ago, although he has grown from 30HP to 3030HP naked in 64 levels and 5 expansions :)  What does a warrior do any different now than that same warrior did 4 years ago?  Nothing comes to mind that isn't /discipline defensive (or evasive) or &quot;Area Taunt&quot; to be quite blunt.  <br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I have had a lot of fun in EQ in the past, but as they say, &quot;The more things change, the more they stay the same&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">05-13-2003, 05:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm still havin fun, although I wish I could fastforward to 65 with 150 AA points because I'm sick of grinding, regardless of class balance issues.  That's one thing I really miss from Velious, the feeling of being &quot;done&quot;.  Back when we were level 60 and there were no AA points to get and I could play alts or farm loot or work on quests on non-raid nights rather than the endless AA grind.  There are some people that have reached that point even with AA, but they are few and far between, and I'm guessing the next expansion will come with 100 new AA points to grind out.<br />
<br />
I still like playing a warrior though, more than any other class.  Personally I think PoP with a good group is a lot more fun than exp anywhere else, precisely because of the old slow ping-pong and everyone having to be on their toes rather than just pull, hit 'a', go afk in Luclin where exp mobs couldn't do any damage whatsoever and monks and rangers could tank all day without being any drain on the healer and a cleric *had* to melee to justify their spot in the group because a paladin could keep a group healed without even having to med.</div></div><hr />

i realy like to tap taunt once in a while and chew them out for not holding agro. always seams to work when you dont need to taunt or don't want agro. talk about busting some egos. (dont do this on mobs the say something when you taunt though)</div></div><hr />

What usually cures my boredom is working on a quest or taking up a tradeskill. Sometimes playing an alt can be interesting too. The best cure for boredom I find is to play with your friends.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dandolo1</div><div class="date">05-14-2003, 01:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Very interesting thread here guys...<br />
<br />
I'm a  lvl 65 War (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=450024) in a guild capible of clearing NToV, TMax, PoS Lords, etc. and have recently quit EQ.<br />
<br />
It's actually quite funny (or sad) why I quit, as I broke-up with my girlfreind on the phone and didn't think to stop MT'ing a BoT Tower Lord - who in the end droped zip.<br />
<br />
Personally, I was busting my ass to grind out AA or Raid every night so that I could get ND/PP or new lewts and squeeze out a few more HP.  Then I stopped.  Why the fuck does it matter if I have 5200hp or 5250hp unbuffed?  More specifically, why am I ruining my RL for this seemingly trivial goal??<br />
<br />
I always said to myself, I would stop playing EQ when it ceased to be fun.  Well, the meaningless 3 hour exp grind or 5 hour raid to get more and more HP has some serious declining benefits, and was the final Straw.<br />
<br />
In short, here is the summary:<br />
- BoT and Other Higher-end raids we were moving towards were increasing in length, and decreasing in reward.  A boss that takes 2-3 hours to kill and *potentially* drops nothing, is a waste of my life. Period.<br />
- PoP Raids and Mobs alike have insaine DPS, hitting for thousands (note the plural) of HP each swing.  So by me gaining another 50hp, which took hours and hours of my life, what does that accomplish??  Can I withstand one more hit??  Umm, no.<br />
- Torv isn't an overly popular server, but our problem is potentially universal.  There are about 5-8 guilds to whom our  potential targets are worthwile, and the competition is fearsome.  Getting cockblocked at all our soughtafter targets following a server reset and doing Xanametch (sp) agian, isn't fun.<br />
<br />
So the current raiding targets + future raiding targets + exp grinding = no fun.  Then sadly, EQ won't be getting my $12.95 anymore.<br />
<br />
Any feedback is welcomed.  I've respected alot of ppl on these bords for years now, so shoot from the hip.<br />

I think my five month break helped me gain perspective and allowed me to come back and see the game as a game again.  That is a lot of why I am having such fun again.<br />
<br />
Some people need a break more than anything.  It isn't being a warrior or the loot, or what you get to see.  It is the comraderie, the joy of accomplishing a difficult task as a group, and it's a great eascape.  At least that is why I enjoy EQ now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raunstonecutter</div><div class="date">05-14-2003, 01:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've started having fun again.  I take the game for what it is, fun.  I log on, put my LFG on, and chat with my friends, I ooc a couple times in a zone, and if I have nothing to show for it after about 30 min of LFG, I either log off, go farm something, switch to an alt, or I mess around the house and wait for a tell.<br />
<br />
I have a lot of fun in xp groups because I have attaned a certain level of equipement.  I have really good agro weapons.  I also have decent hps/ac gear.  Shoot, today I was complimented on my tanking over the SK they previsously had.  Better mana after fight, better kill time, and better agro control.  Got to love the greatstaff of thunder.  Best purchase I ever made.<br />
<br />
If I didn't enjoy playing EQ, I wouldn't play it anymore.  I only play for fun now, and if I get roped into doing something I don't want to do, I log off.  You just have to figure out what you enjoy.<br />
<br />
I know a guy who is currently going a little crazy, probably due to RL stress.  I suggested he take some time off EQ, as it was not helping him relive stress, and he blew up at me.  You can't let yourself get so worked up over the game that you go nuts in real life.  I get pissed at the game, I get pissed at slowers who wait too long to slow, but I'm never pissed for too long.<br />
<br />
So, for me, the &quot;slightly above average&quot; warrior, is EQ fun?  Yes, because I make it fun for me.</div></div><hr />

   Hmm there does seem to be a trend there !  Do I have fun in this game as a Warrior YES a lot of fun.  Joined EQ in the first week and have 234 days to 65, hmm a bit slow  right.  I still have fun cause I like to help others even when I get NO loot and NO exp.  I cant count the number of times a small guild has ask me to MT a mob for one of them or the times we hook up with another small guild to take down Vindi  with 20 peeps and thats about as good as we get but thats ok cause I still get a real thrill on raids.   I still have fun cause I like to explore and visit new zones.  I want to know every zone in the game and the mobs in every zone.  I think that maybe taking the fast track to the top could be part of the problem cause once there whats left.<br />

<br />
Well said.  If you play EQ for loot or to &quot;beat the game&quot; you're bound to get frustrated with it.  It's just a treadmill, you will never be done, someone will always have better gear than you, there will always be mobs you haven't killed, there will always be AA points you don't have.  <br />
<br />
If you play EQ to spend time with your friends and have a good time, you will enjoy it a lot more.  If I didn't have friends to group/chat with regularly, I would have quit this game a long time ago.</div></div><hr />

I was quite happen in SoV when I was 60, and hoped that I would never have to exp grind again.  I said the same thing when I hit 65... and now I've got to get 40 more AAs to even be considered a 'decent' tank.  I already got 2 levels and 15 AAs in the last month or so... bleh.  I wish raid exp had always been around and that it was about as good as elemental plane raid exp... would make this game a lot more enjoyable for me, since I hate grinding and only really enjoy raiding.</div></div><hr />

As a leader, I guess that's a subjective question.  Do I enjoy seeing my people happy?  Yes.  Do I enjoy taking down a particular mob? Not really.  I'm so busy doing the &quot;work&quot; that helps make things move forward that I rarely stop to enjoy something myself.<br />

If it were not for my guild and my friends, I would have walked away long ago.  I know I think about walking away more and more.  /shrugs</div></div><hr />

I recently had a similar experience. I pretty much took a couple months off and realized that I missed a lot of good friends but just hated the exp grind and the broke ass mobs that wouldn't drop anything. Also the always thinking I needed to be there as I am really my guilds only MT when it comes to certain mobs. <br />
To help myself I have stopped on the exp grind. I'm not saying completely but if i log on and my usual partners in crime are not out and I can't find anything that catch my attention I log. As a guild we have moved to only raiding 2-3 times a week with Wed and Friday being set in stone and usually use Sunday to help out with whatever mini bosses peeps need for quest (these are usually a 1 group deal so if there are more then some will go find a place to maybe do some exp grinding). This has helped bring the fun back into the game for me and helped me out in RL. Gear and exp are great but they will never be my reason to play again. My friends here were to great for me to quit all together but my kids are enjoying the change and have actually had to started encouraging me to play from time to time. It was a nice wake-up call that has carried over to a lot more than just EQ. I am proud of our guild as we have been moving to encourage a lot more RL activities and have all bonded closer as friends in and out of game.<br />
This site has also helped me a lot with not seeing so much flaming that i get sick. I never could stand the h8. This place is awesome and the peeps even better.<br />
Good luck and wish ya the best.......Wes<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">05-14-2003, 12:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My friends have scattered to the four winds.  The guild I was in for over 2 years went through a major self destruct, basically because we had a couple of drama queen officers who always kept stirring the pot when it wasn't necessary and the guild leader didn't have the stones to toss them when he should have.  As a result I've joined two other guilds, both of which were more raid oriented and pretty decent guilds over all.<br />
<br />
The first I left because one of the members, a 16 year old kid no less, decided to ride my ass about raid attendence.  Like I somehow owed him my spare time after spending my 40 hours a week earning a living.  I'd joined the guild specifically because they didn't have mandatory raid attendence.  I used to like to raid, but wanted to have some say over how often I had to.  When I left though, I left the few friends who had moved with me from my long time guild.<br />
<br />
My current guild is a very good guild.  However, given the PST versus EST differences, the fact that Warriors aren't really a top tank choice anymore for groups, and my play time has dropped off due to frustration with EQ in general, I haven't made many friends within the guild.  I'm on a semi-break at this point, only play a couple of times a week when I really get a feel to and don't raid at all.  I wouldn't be surprised if I walked away from the game completely in the next couple of months, we'll see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">05-14-2003, 01:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As a kind of rebuttal to Brutul; I think people need a &quot;end game&quot; scenario again liek there used to be pre-whatever EQ has become now.<br />
<br />
First example is this: Remember when level 60 was as far as you could go? Remember how it felt when you hit level 60; got some experience buffer in it so you could die a few times and not worry? What did most people do than I ask. People &quot;had fun&quot;. Common train of thought now is &quot;must grind levels must grind aa's must grind keys must grind must grind&quot;....Thing is in my opinion &quot;No One Is Having Fun&quot;. People log on like they're goign to work or school. Put in the time, do your details for the day, and log off. Besides the carrot on the end of the stick that's been dangling there, there's really nothing left to chase. <br />
Sure, new zones, new content, ub3r3r gear, whatever..they're all short-term rewards for an exponential time investment taken to acquire. Does it mean that people should or shouldn't feel misplaced though? NOt at all.<br />
There's 2 types of gamers for arguements sake. <br />
<br />
Powergamers is the first; where no matter what reward is acquired the speed upon recieving that reward is what matters. Hours, Days, Months, etc..all mean nothing as long as the time invested is spent running at such a breakneck speed that the reward is soon forgotten as soon as the next set of reward(s) is make available.<br />
Casual Players is the other; wherein the problems of EQ are most visible. The carrot chase isn't an option here; basically the time invested means more to the person than the reward itself; and as you grow in the game itself the time investement becomes too much of a chore and obstacle and after analizing the reward; the investment doesn't retain any validity. So, what happens? Basically the enviroment wherein the player subsides is altered. The enjoyment is replaced with frustration, the association with others becomes a struggle, and most oftenly relationships with others is strained due to the player trying to convey their plight to others who may or may not share the same thoughts. Bad vibes only fester within that target group of disgruntled players; the others who allow their rewards no matter the worth or stature to justify themselves only hold more resentment and gravitiate further and further away; basically eliminating their contact with the other players.<br />
<br />
In game it works fine in my opinion. There's no matter of interaction due to the seperate enviroments where they exist an even a random passing by in a common area doesn't generate the negativity...<br />
<br />
The peoblems are within our walls here...Messageboards. Problems fester, ignorance towards issues that do not effect us runs rampant, and in many cases verbal assaults are the norm towards those who don't share a common viewpoint, and often within the context of said statements the thoughts are taken either worse than implied or even taken personally. <br />
<br />
i dunno. sorry for the long post.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wasnt talking about the lucky few that are Elemental capable.<br />
I wasnt talking about the lucky many that are EB capable.<br />
I was talking about EQWar population. The average war.<br />
<br />
Take the average war (without EB) in PoP.  Lets look at what he can offer to a group :<br />
<br />
**DPS :<br />
Pathetic compared to monk/rogue/beast/ranger/wiz/mage<br />
**Tanking<br />
Just a big better than Pally Jim (add Heals/LoH/CC and call it even)<br />
**Agro<br />
So mediocre that it will actually slow down the group.<br />
<br />
Dont get me wrong, warriors are a very balanced class if you<br />
take in account their overall perfomance (dps/tanking/groupability).<br />
The problem is the lack of good agro capacity on xp mobs just<br />
makes warriors so inneficient that they arent worth grouping with.<br />
<br />
What we offer, everyone can do better. Thats the problem.<br />
Thats why the average war gets shafted. Shafted HARDCORE.<br />
The issue for well equiped wars isnt the same .(You &amp; Me &amp; EBwars).<br />
<br />
*Uber warriors are perfectly balanced melees. (compared to melees)<br />
*EB warriors are well balanced melees. (compared to melees).<br />
*The average War0784 has a so pathetic agro capacity, that<br />
his overall balanced class becomes a waste of group space.<br />
<br />
Ps : War 65 , 230 played in 800 RL since character created.<br />
Only character i have, only character i play, my love.<br />
<br />
I managed to get away from the &quot;&quot;Pathetic Agro Capacity&quot; and<br />
i absolutely love playing war. Its THE BEST CLASS there is.<br />
We're the stuff heroes are made off. ATM exept for the DPS<br />
issue compared to casters, i think i am perfectly balanced.<br />
<br />
Can War0768 say the same thing ? I doub it<br />
<br />

I am one of my guilds 2 MT's.  I love raiding, and tanking the bosses.  I love my guild, and I like to spend time with most of them.<br />
<br />
I hate grinding.  Aggro on exp mobs sucks for me, and I get too stressed out grinding.  So I quit grinding.  I slowly get aa's through raid exp.  Hell, I dinged 65 tanking in HoT to equip an applicant.  I do enjoy exp groups with guildies, but I don't join unless it will be 100% guildies or friends only.  So my aa's are lacking.  I also decided to buy some fun aa over doing all defensive aa first.  Though, using the weapon I do, I wouldn't be able to hold taunt without PB (I got it before PB, and couldn't aggro well, got PB and with each rank aggro got easier).  Also, I was recently parsed by a guildie monk (had others hits on), and while tanking I came out with equal dps to him even though he was behind the mob.<br />
<br />
One thing that helps exp groups is my decision that I will not taunt off of someone who is not trying to lose aggro.  If the monk, no matter who he is, takes aggro I let him tank until he tries to fd.  If he doesn't try he gets to tank, and usually the healers get angry.  Now, if he fd's but fails, or has been noticably trying to avoid aggro, I will taunt.  But for me, I'm not going to be stressed out while getting exp.  I've told my guildies up front about how I handle taunt, though I often taunt anyway, since I know they do try.  If I'm in a pick up group (what I did before I quit them anyway) same thing, and if they can tank fine and the healers don't get mad, then I sit back and say screw it.<br />
<br />
Somedays I do feel bad about not being the best tank I could be (via aa's) for my guild, but I try not to let that get to me, since I would quit the game before grinding exp, and they prefer me playing.  If drama ever does get too much, I either log completely, or play an alt that is on a different server now =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I enjoy a lot Roaming (some of the best :Chardok, Acrylia, Hate's Fury), escort missions, fine ring type events (Mukaji or the new acrylia one), and SURPRISES. I think SOE should think about more ways to get xp than plain killing at the same spot, like make quest that give a lot of xp (Thelin's maze was awesome). Or give xp to trade skillers, some solo event that is different, depending of your class (I dream of a ring where a NPC hand you 60 bandage and you need to fight alone 5 NPCs one after another :D ).</div></div><hr />

Quit that, it'll make you go blind.  :p<br />
<br />
In response to the question.  Before I got into the guild I am in now, I had grown to hate being a warrior.  I am a warrior at heart, but the class has so many issues to be addressed, particularly for a casual player in the type of gear I was in, that it was just too frustrating to deal with.  That's especially true when compared to how EASY it is to play a caster.  (I leveled my shaman to 40 in no time).  Now, I really like being a warrior despite all the problems we have, because deep down I'm all about wading into combat and protecting my friends.  If it weren't for all the good people in my guild (and all the gearing up I've done since joining them), I'd have deleted my war by now and focused on the shaman.  (Oh, and I group exclusively with guildies and friends now too. that helps the fun factor tremendously)<br />

DPS - Pathetic compared to monk/rogue/beast/ranger/wiz/mage <br />
<br />
Wars with the offensive AA's and a noice 2'her can crack off some nice dmg. 150+dps isn't something to look your nose down apon.<br />
<br />
Tanking - Just a big better than Pally Jim (add Heals/LoH/CC and call it even) <br />
<br />
Paladins tanking in exp groups I can agree wit, but I havent seen a PoP named being tanked by a Paladin. Pallies are cool and all, but lets face facts, we have more hp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">05-15-2003, 07:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Paladins tanking in exp groups I can agree wit, but I havent seen a PoP named being tanked by a Paladin.

<br />
Sort of true.  I've heard of and seen lots of situations where Paladins are the tank of choice of trash mobs, just because they hold aggro so much better and faster and the mob will therefore go dead faster without caster squishes.  And I've even heard of some guilds using Knights to tank some boss mobs, just not all of them.<br />
<br />
But yeah, for most of the big boss mobs most of the time it's a Warrior doing the deed.  But for most of us, and by most of us I mean the majority of Warriors in the game, we don't MT big PoP boss mobs.  So it tends to be a moot point for more of us than not.  It's a nice benefit, if you ever get to use it.  Otherwise, it's just a hypothetical thing.  It's kind of like our mightystrike discipline.  Nice in theory, but not used all that often by most of us.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ohh agree on that, i do from 150-200 in XP tanking.<br />
<br />
The question is : <br />
*** Since the average warriors performs poorly in xp group, specially compared to a hybrid, why group him ? ***<br />
<br />
Hisdps is rather low (again the AVERAGE war)<br />
His agro sux (hence he cant tank, and will slow the group down)<br />
He offers zero polyvalence to the group.<br />
<br />
And we all know xp named in PoP are a myth.<br />
Even more that the RBG was in seb.<br />
<br />
High end warriors are monsters. The average Jo0674 is hurting BAD.</div></div><hr />
