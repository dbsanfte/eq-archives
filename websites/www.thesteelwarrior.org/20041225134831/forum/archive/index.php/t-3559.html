<br />
Last i checked, ldon raids are still 32 ppl maximum, is that still the case ?<br />
<br />
If it is, how is your Time guild doing Ldon raids ?? <br />
<br />
you try to do 2 raids at the same time ?<br />
you do 1 raid and night off for the others ?<br />
I 'm totally off and you can field your 60 timeraid man in ldon ?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Looking for the best solution, because at the moment, they all have major drawbacks.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dunno what is the best solution for your guild but we just have all lost dungeon raids as optional and haven't really had a problem with too many people.<br />
<br />
You might be able to do two raids at once but again depends on your guild.  The raids are not cakewalks even the supposed 'VT' level ones and you need strong forces so you have to be careful to not have two raids that are weak and won't finish as opposed to one strong one that will.</div></div><hr />
