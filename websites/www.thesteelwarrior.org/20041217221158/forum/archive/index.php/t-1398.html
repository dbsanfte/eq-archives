<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valeris</div><div class="date">06-20-2003, 06:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Proposition: Reduction in knight aggro away from cheap and easy 'locking in' of aggro coupled with a minor improvement in warrior aggro to the effect that  they have slightly more control in an exp situation.<br />
Mechanism yet to be determined :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rumblingdeth</div><div class="date">06-20-2003, 06:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What Valeris said, don't trivialize encounters with tank aggro lock. But this BS of a stun (which a mob is immune to) gaining unlimited aggro sucks. Same with movement modifiers (don't let SKs become the new god tanks either), and up the warrior taunt aggro and incidence of it WORKING as it should, ie: mob hammers taunter, not slower/nuker/snarer gleefully while laughing at taunter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">06-20-2003, 06:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1) Unlink timers on offensive and defensive disciplines, of course making it so that they cant be used together and so that you cant immediately activate one type after coming out of the other type.<br />
2)  Either nerf knight aggro or give warriors special attacks at certain level increments that either add hate or have a negative impact on the mob that generate aggro.  Examples of negative impact being : <br />
Debilitating Strike<br />
lvl 45<br />
Mob takes damage comparable to a crit and has AC/ATK debuffed for 00:02:00  <br />
Hamstring<br />
Lvl 40<br />
Mob takes damage comparable to a critical hit and is snared for 00:06:00<br />
or something along those lines.  Both being innate and not dependent on RNG and not stackable or reusable on the same mob, let it put a dot counter on them.  Also, generating hate whether it worked or not if it was made resistable.  Either that or an attack that gained pure hate that scaled with level would work.  <br />
3)  Improve itemisation to make more war only items that improve us for all levels of the game, not just endgame.<br />
4)  This is the least desireable in my opinion, but it's always an option:  Give warriors abilities that allow them to effectively solo if you're going to make Knights far and away the preferred xp tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chatja ogre</div><div class="date">06-20-2003, 08:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Make all our discs refresh faster above 60 and im not talkign 1 min cut off :P<br />
<br />
5 min evas, 7 min def, 9 min fellstrike and so one.<br />

revamp armor a bit. Make all warrior armor have 10 percent more hp and ac then hybrid and then make others less. Leave all/all items as it is.<br />
<br />
Upgrade warrior archery a bit. Make hate proc discs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">06-20-2003, 09:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What Val said, with my one idea(blatantly stolen, I just don't remember from whom) for warrior improvement being this:<br />
<br />
Double taunt:  A level 40 skill, caps at whatever is appropriate.  Most likely all taunt classes would get it, but with a lower skill cap.  Would work like double attack, ie whenever you taunt, it makes a skill check, and on a successfull skill check, you taunt twice, doubling the chance that you regain agro.<br />
<br />
I think that one skill alone would make a huge difference, as most people would be ok(I hope) ith slower getting agro, if the tank could get it right back off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chatja ogre</div><div class="date">06-20-2003, 09:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Solution to all our problems: Give warriors 4 arms and make us able to wield 4 weapons or 2 2hers, or 2 weapons and 2 shields!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunrack</div><div class="date">06-21-2003, 12:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">How about adding Furor's Idea to the sticky?  didn't everyone agree with that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kazzuk</div><div class="date">06-21-2003, 02:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am all for Furor's idea, I really like the concept, perhaps some of the numbers need to be tweaked or toned down (play tested). The nice thing about this concept is it leaves knights the way they currently are and goes completely around the snap aggro issue by encouraging a different group makeup, one that encourages multiple tanks classes to group together. Not to mention the added fun factor!<br />
<br />
 Furor's Idea<br />
I've been asking for a DoT aggro for, oh, 3.5 years now.<br />
<br />
It's used in DAoC and it's going to be used in WoW.<br />
<br />
Anyways it's simple.<br />
<br />
Warriors get special attacks, (Edited comment about monks). Anyhow, they start at level 25, and scale up.<br />
<br />
Level 25:<br />
Skill: Rupture<br />
Effect: 5 points of damage per tick upon a successful rupture/25 points of hate per tick upon a succesful rupture. Duration, 2 minutes. Reuse, 24 seconds.<br />
<br />
Level 35:<br />
Skill: Maim<br />
Effect: 15 points of damage per tick/50 points of hate per tick. Duration, 2 minutes. Reuse, 24 seconds. DPS gain: 3 dps.<br />
<br />
Level 45:<br />
Skill: Disembowel<br />
Effect: 40 points of damage per tick/100 points of hate per tick. Duration, 2 minutes. Reuse, 24 seconds. DPS Gain: 7 dps.<br />
<br />
Level 55:<br />
Skill: Eviscerate<br />
Effect: 100 points of damage per tick/200 points of hate per tick. Duration, 2 minutes. Reuse 24, seconds. DPS gain: 17 dps.<br />
<br />
Level 65:<br />
Skill: Raze<br />
Effect: 150 points of damage per tick/350 points of hate per tick.<br />
Duration, 2 minutes. Reuse, 24 seconds. DPS gain: 25 dps.<br />
<br />
Defintions: The warrior, through experience and training has discovered ways to cause harm to their enemy by striking at vital organs and body parts. The abilities cause extreme pain to their victims, enhancing the perceived threat of the warrior to the creature/opponent. <br />
<br />
Why the reuse time? Let me explain. Area Taunt never quite worked as it was intended, primarily due to the fact that Everquest designers do not play nor understand the warrior class. Through use of these abilities, a SKILLED warrior, could very easily create an area of effect taunt upon several mobs at once by careful maintenance via the reuse time on the ability. <br />
<br />
Will it break messes? Of course, the creature/mob is bleeding/has his guts hanging out and staggering in pain. There in lays the rub. It has to really be used with caution, but also demands a certain level of skill besides just slamming your idiotic taunt button. <br />
<br />
Will it stack with other warriors who use their abilities? Yep. We want to be stackable. This allows us to build aggro chains without having to resort to cheesedick gimmicks.<br />
<br />
Will it add undue amounts of DPS? Hardly. At max level a warrior will add 25dps to his total damage output. <br />
<br />
Will this fix grouping and taunt issues? In my opinion, most definitely. At the very least it adds a new dimension to the warrior class but stays in line with the abilities and class definition of the warrior.<br />
<br />
To prevent a warrior from kiting like a sissy druid, the effects would be linked to the distance the warrior is from the mob. <br />
<br />
Additionally, you could not stack all 5 abilities and pretend you're a necro.<br />
<br />
Feel free to comment, flame, whatever...<br />
<br />
<br />
If not that, then some of the other ideas I've liked the best also do not nerf knights:<br />
<br />
1. I advocate bringing back a true disparity between knights and warriors in the AC and HP arenas, i.e a meaningful gap. In other words, give us some more AC and HP. <br />
<br />
2. Do away with defensive entirely and put us on our own mitigation table. <br />
<br />
3. Put messages on taunt, at least a fail or success if not both! <br />
<br />
4. Perhaps make taunt work in at least melee range... not whisping in the mobs ear?? maybe even a little bit further....? <br />
<br />
5. Increase war skill cap in taunt to 250.<br />
<br />
These changes would make groups choose, do we want a tank that can guarantee aggro so we can slow on inc and never worry about mana or extraneous heals 99% of the time (as knights now enjoy in POP).. or do we want a tank that can solo the mob for a decent amount of time before the slow and actually live, and not have to worry about extraneous heals 99% of the time if the group manages their aggro correctly.<br />
<br />
The changes to taunt range and taunt messages would also be beneficial to knights.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valeris</div><div class="date">06-21-2003, 03:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like Furor's idea, I'd like to add it on top of a aggrolock change because it does add another dimension, I just hesitate to add 'too' much flexibility before we see what the first set of changes - specifically related to slow aggro (and thus VERY neccessary) go in. I'm not sure how the dot, which provides us with reliable hate over time, balances the current situation where a knight grabs control of the monster before it's even in camp and hardly lets it go...pretty sure most people will take the sure thing, particularly if the warrior doesn't have the hp's to handle multiple mobs well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">landrain</div><div class="date">06-21-2003, 04:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">out of  the pure melee - warriors do the least dps, by a wide margin<br />
<br />
out of the pure melee - we mitigate best, of course the others have leather and chain armor<br />
<br />
out of the pure melee - we have most hps <br />
<br />
out of the pure melee - we have no innate aggro control skills (besides taunt) and we are least able to gain aggro<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
out of the plate classes - we share the best mitigation with knights (defensive is for 3 min we actually have best mitigation)<br />
<br />
out of the plate classes - we are middle of road dps.<br />
<br />
out of the plate classes - we have most hps.<br />
<br />
out of the plate classes - out of the pure melee - we have no innate aggro control skills (besides taunt) and we are least able to gain aggro<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
What do we need to be a tank?<br />
<br />
DPS- the dps should be at least on par with pure melee, we should not be significantly lower, and we should do the most dps of any of the plate classes.<br />
<br />
Mitigation - We should mitigate damage at a signficantly better rate than the other melee or plate classes.<br />
<br />
HP's we should have the most hps by a significant margin.<br />
<br />
Aggro - We should have some way to innately gain aggro.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Increasing DPS will help aggro some. but we definately need a boost. we should hands down do more dps than either knight, with spells they should equal/slightly exceed our dps.<br />
<br />
Mitigation needs reworked- I am really of the opinion, that removing defensive and giving us a permanent 30% db reduction would be the way to go.<br />
<br />
HP's need redone, give us stamina to 355 like casters, and also give us full hp for stamina. also Change melee gear that has mana to give us hps in replacement for mana.<br />
<br />
Aggro - add an innate aggro generation to every attack we make.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">landrain</div><div class="date">06-21-2003, 04:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">one thing that always gets me is mana on my items...<br />
<br />
i made a statement prior about adding 1hp = 1 mana on items, and people laugh and scoffedd, well i did some research. Here are some cultural stats...<br />
<br />
Most people aggree that  take away the agnostic screw, that cultural was very fair and pretty balanced.<br />
<br />
<br />
WAR/BRD - barbarian made<br />
<br />
Helanic Tundra Bracer  +25 AC +5 Sta +5 vsMg +5 vsFire +5 vsCold +5 vsPos +5 vsDis +50 HP <br />
<br />
Helanic Tundra Breastplate  +51 AC +10 Str +10 Sta +80 HP<br />
<br />
 <br />
WAR only - human made<br />
<br />
Fierce Heraldic Bracer  +25 AC +5 Dex +5 vsMg +5 vsFire +5 vsCold +5 vsPos +5 vsDis +55 HP <br />
<br />
Fierce Heraldic Breastplate  +51 AC +10 Str +5 Sta +5 Dex +80 HP<br />
<br />
<br />
BRD only - human made<br />
<br />
Dragonkin Heraldic Bracer  +25 AC +5 Cha +5 vsMg +5 vsFire +5 vsCold +5 vsPos +5 vsDis +30 HP +30 Mana <br />
<br />
Dragonkin Heraldic Breastplate  +51 AC +10 Sta +10 Cha +40 HP +40 Mana <br />
<br />
<br />
WAR/CLR/PAL/BRD - high elf made<br />
<br />
Blessed Full Mithril Bracer  +25 AC +5 Wis +5 vsMg +5 vsFire +5 vsCold +5 vsPos +5 vsDis +30 HP +30 Mana<br />
<br />
Blessed Full Mithril Breastplate  +51 AC +5 Sta +10 Wis +5 Cha +40 HP +40 Mana <br />
<br />
<br />
Seems to me that on BP's it is exactly a 1 for 1 trade of HP for mana. (80hp on war only) vs (40hp + 40mana)<br />
<br />
Seems that on bracers it is actuall a better ratio for the casters.<br />
(50hp or 55hp) vs (30hp+ 30mana)<br />
<br />
So why would giving war or im my opinion pure melee's a 1hp for 1 mana on their gear be out of line?<br />
<br />
The reason is it would not be... except MANA on hybrid gear is inflated to out of proportion.  they get all our hps and all the mana at no disadvantage...<br />
<br />
IMO, if they can make items where the stats change according to level/flags... why can they not also change coresponding to class? pure melee get extra hps, for their mana.</div></div><hr />

I am not in uber raid guild nor do i feel im under  geared &lt;in Tribunal armor&gt; and i do know that at any given time during the fight that any given class can take away what i work so hard to get and only way to get it back is either other class dies or gates. Something needs to be done!!!! Remember when if you didnt have a warrior or cleric ya didnt go after XXXmob? Now it 2druids and a Knight class. They can call it Warrior's wraith an innate ability , and for it i will gladly give them back Charge, mightystrike,furious,percision ,fellstrike, aggressive, resistance ,fearless ,evasive,and fortitude. The only way they can get the Defencive disc is to put us on a seperate table because that is the only thing that seperates us from knight class now and when we have to use it it is a given that we are gonna die anyway. This is just my thoughts on it not like anyone but the warrior class gives a rat asre about it,and not like the high and might will read and do something about it!!!!<br />

(not so much that I disagree, just that I don't see where continuing to beat that horse helps our cause)  Lets just get a good listing of improvement ideas for our class and see if the devs actually look at it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rade</div><div class="date">06-24-2003, 01:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree.  Continuing to criticize the pally's won't get us anywhere because we know that Sony won't break the nerf stick out on them.<br />
<br />
The five points made by Kazzuk and the idea for taunt DoT's from Furor seem to be our strongest points.  We need to make sure the dev's see those.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Buun Sofsteel</div><div class="date">06-24-2003, 04:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like Furor's idea and always have, however if that doesn't happen here is what I would like to see.<br />
<br />
<br />
1) Warrior Crits - this was once our bread and butter and no other class had it.  Make it special again by adding a .25 percent Hate number to warrior, and only warrior, crits (i.e. a 60 point crit generates 15 points of Hate)<br />
<br />
2) Warriors may taunt at range - since many of the problems stem from the initial contact of mob with a group, allow a warrior, and warrior only, to taunt on inc.  &quot;Hey, you friggen greaseball, didn't we buy that monkey once!&quot; &lt;--- heh sorry was watching Above the Law.<br />
<br />
3) Make all discs 10 minute refresh except Furious and Fortitude (15 mins).  We don't use anything now except defensive unless you are using Precision while you aggro kite somewhere in the absence of taunt.  If other classes can go 14 secs with stuns and not get hit at all almost at will, then Furious and Fortitude every 15 minutes for 8 secs is certainly not out of line and, at the same time, the refresh is far enough apart that you can't formulate a Warrior DA line.<br />
<br />
4) Increase the warrior ac modifier from 1.5 or whatever it is now.  Give warriors a clear advantage.<br />
<br />
5) Give some unique AA skills like...<br />
<br />
a) Weapon Specialization 1-3 - can only be used with one weapon type (1HB, 2HS, etc. - each level adds 1 to weapon damage and decreases delay by 1. Warriors are the master of combat, it is all we do.  We don't have to learn spellcasting or other bullshit, make us better melee.<br />
<br />
b) Dirty Tactics 1-3 - similar to what PoN suggested but is a button like taunt (and can't be used in conjunction with taunt) that increases DPS and Hate -- can only be used on mobs equal to or below the level of the warrior to prevent any affect on raid encounters but is useful for enabling the War to maintain aggro and decent DPS in group setting<br />
<br />
c) Furious Kick (Slam) 1-3 - Wars should be able to kick em in the gonads or take out a knee.  Works the same as Furious Bash but makes our kicks not only interrupt, but generate a level of Hate on a successful hit -- again, only works on mobs of equal to or lower level than the warrior<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Now I know warriors won't get EVERYTHING, these are just some ideas to pick from.  Warriors need a clear advantage and it can go in one or two directions...<br />
<br />
1) Increase ability to hold aggro and be mainly the ultimate in defensive or, <br />
<br />
2) Leave aggro and vastly improve DPS well above the other defensive tanks and just under that of a rog, monk, ranger so we will have a spot as the second MT in a group (I know the big boys out there have no desire for this but if I can't get decent aggro to MT in a group I want the DPS).</div></div><hr />
