<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Caldron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have approximately 25k to spend and am looking for more upgrades. I do not have alot of play time nor am I in a large guild we are tradeskillers not raiders. I do have a 65 druid at my disposal to try to get some stuff myself. Help I am working LDoN but getting points is taking time. Any help would be greatly appriciated. I would also like some suggestions outside my price range as I will save a bit more for them. Thanks again all.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would say it depends on what level the Warrior is.<br />
<br />
With a 65 druid to PL couldn't you get a Warrior back to level 20-30 in a couple days?<br />
<br />
With 25k you could buy a RZ halfee a really, really nice set of Fierce Heraldic.<br />
<br />
Depends on play time and stuff.</div></div><hr />

This is where a vial of prismatic dye comes in. ;)<br />

To the original poster: I can't reach Magelo to look at your profile, so pardon me if I mention something you already have, but Veksar has a lot of good drops for warriors, including Kylong Shinguards, Kylong Darkmail Gauntlets, Kylong Darkmail Girdle, Kylong Darkmail Pauldrons, Kylong Darkmail Visor, Kylong Darkmail Coif, Boots of the Kunzar Wanderer, Dented Kunzar War Helm, and the Soulscream Belt.<br />
<br />
Anyone ever wish that other zones were as well itemized for risk/reward as Veksar? I do, but the only other one that yields similar good times, exp and loot is the new Droga. ;)</div></div><hr />
