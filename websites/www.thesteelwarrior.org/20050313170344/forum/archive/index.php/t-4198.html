<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Madronedorf</div><div class="date">11-11-2003, 04:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I apologize if this is something that doesnt belong in this forum, as its doesnt directly pertain to Elemental/Time encounters directly....<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyways from What I've always heard is that DI makes a check after a round is done, and if the persons HP is below 15, DI goes off, doing a real CH, (if it doesnt fail)<br />
<br />
However, I hear about how DI saves people, and see it save people a lot more then if those simple factors were all that was taken in effect.<br />
<br />
I've heard from some people that it makes the check after each hit or set of hits, and not the round itself....  What is the prevailing opinion on how it works?<br />
<br />
For Simplicty Sake lets assume a 10K Tank. Then assume the Tank currently has 1501 HP and the mob does a quad 400...<br />
<br />
Would....  it go<br />
<br />
A)<br />
SoAndSo hits YOU for 400 Damage<br />
DI Triggers<br />
SoAndSo hits YOU for 400 Damage<br />
SoAndSo hits YOU for 400 Damage<br />
SoAndSo hits YOU for 400 Damage<br />
<br />
End Result: Tank Lives -  Tank at 8800 HP<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
B)<br />
SoAndSo hits YOU for 400 Damage<br />
SoAndSo hits YOU for 400 Damage<br />
DI Triggers - (Cause Even though Attacks from Primary from mob happens at same time, it considers them in a slightly different timeframe, so DI has a chance to go off?<br />
SoAndSo hits YOU for 400 Damage<br />
SoAndSo hits YOU for 400 Damage<br />
<br />
End Result Tank at 9200 HP<br />
<br />
or <br />
<br />
C)<br />
SoAndSo hits YOU for 400 Damage<br />
SoAndSo hits YOU for 400 Damage<br />
SoAndSo hits YOU for 400 Damage<br />
SoAndSo hits YOU for 400 Damage<br />
<br />
End Result: Tank Dead,<br />
 DI never has a chance to Trigger....<br />
<br />
if A or B is how it works is this why sometimse you get DI to go off, but you still die?<br />
<br />
IE  same 10k Tank (For Sinplicity Purpose's assuming case B, and assuming numbers that may not be what it takes to fail)<br />
<br />
Tank at 1501 HP<br />
SoAndSo hits you for 400 Damage<br />
SoAndSo hits you for 400 Damage<br />
DI Check Fails - Unfailing Divinity kicks in, does Partial Heal for 700*<br />
SoAndSo hits you for 400 Damage<br />
SoAndSo hits you for 400 Damage<br />
<br />
So you still die even tho DI triggered, you get the &quot;partial heal&quot; but the rest of the round still manages to kill you?<br />
<br />
*Using 700 as a number to illustrate the partial heal as not being enough to last the rest of the round, not as the number that it heals in actuality.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ciae Redemption</div><div class="date">11-11-2003, 02:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's B... though DI would go off after the first of 4 hits since that's where you first go below 15%hp. There are some client/server lag issues that can cause DI to not go off sometimes however. Sorta rare, but it can happen.<br />
<br />
So you still die even tho DI triggered, you get the &quot;partial heal&quot; but the rest of the round still manages to kill you? <br />
<br />
An UD1 partial DI heals 1600hp. A mob that quads for say, 3k, can spike through that easily in one round.<br />
<br />
The healing bug is mostly gone (for now, it comes back every few months for some reason)...<br />
<br />
[Fri Nov 07 20:53:30 2003] You feel bogus as an unknown spell accosts you. <br />
<br />
...is what struck me. The old healing bug was the &quot;Pain and suffering tries to strike you, but misses!&quot; before &quot;You died&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">11-11-2003, 03:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A successful DI heals for 8000, at least I have never seen a DI that healed more than 8K.</div></div><hr />

At least thats how i have been told it works. Anyway its a lifesaver for me. Can cover one chain fail or fizzle, hot stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Domack</div><div class="date">11-17-2003, 10:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Are you maybe thinking of DA as in divine arbitration? <br />
<br />
Thats a cleric aa ability that essentially balances the hp of everyone in the group. When used people with higher hp get the 'you sacrafice a portion of your health for the group' type message. <br />
<br />
Quite seperate from the spell divine intervention.</div></div><hr />

sorry if this is the wrong spot</div></div><hr />

<br />
Was browsing some sections for your info on one grouping HoT and came across this thread.<br />
<br />
If you're in a serious raiding guild or an up and coming raiding guild and your clerics don't have Unfailing Divinity 3 (PoP AA) and Divine Intervention they need it ! It's a massive life saver and can seriously gimp some encounters.<br />
<br />
As mentioned on the post above, Divine Intervention can be gotten off Kunark dragons but from personal experience Veeshans Peak is the best source.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps some of you!<br />

If a full round of melee drops you below neg 13% hps di will never ever go off.</div></div><hr />

Is this a PoTime mob? Holy crap LOL<br />
<br />
Jeezus, isn't that hitting harder than Reparm?</div></div><hr />

You arent meant to fight it btw, we just happened to come across it when we first tried the raid, and when i was searching my logs for examples of DI going of it just came up first :)</div></div><hr />
