<br />
BP Genearl Drakk in UBRS (boss)<br />
Shoulders Rend UBRS<br />
Bracer Random mobs in UBRS<br />
Legs Baron Rivendare Undead Strath<br />
Gaunts Ramstein Undead Strath (right before Rivendare)<br />
Helm Darkmaster (or some crap) Gandling guy at the very end of Scholomance<br />
Boots Kirtonas the Herald in Scholomance.  (not too far in, need blood of the Martyr to spawn him)<br />
<br />
Might all drops in Molten Core now.  Lets are from Magmadar, BP is from Golemagg, bracer and belt are from random zone mobs, gaunts/boots/helm I forget, but from some mobs in there. (Garr, Lucifron, Ghennas, Shazzrah, Gedon, Sulferon, just can't remember which drop which set pieces, I think some can drop a couple different ones)<br />
<br />
Wrath is mostly removed to Blackwing's lair until it comes out.  Wrath helm still drops from Onyxia for sure, legs MAY drop from Ragnaros, but I'm not sure on that one. <br />
<br />
There are also some good alternatives to full Valor set.  I personally had almost a full set and never wore it.  I used Rend's legs and Adam BP to tank.  There are even some good alternatives to Might/Wrath.  None of the set bonuses are really that good, although some of the piece bonuses for Might/Wrath (improve dodge, improve crit, improve parry etc.), are pretty good.  Hope that helps.<br />
<br />
Thanks, good summary of all the valor drops.  Where do you get blood of the martyr?  I've done Scholo quite a few times, but never even realized that the boots mob needs to be spawned.  Also, I'm almost sure I got the bracers in LBRS off a trash mob right near entrance.<br />
<br />
My guild has cleared UBRS a few times, got the Valor BP the first time.  General is still semi-tough for us, but not overly so.  How difficult is Onyxnia and the mobs in MC compared to general?  How many people do you really need to do MC?  My guild can probably muster 20 level 60's and another 5-10 level 55+.  Is that enough of a force?  I need to look up some info on Onyxia and MC...  any advance info would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />

You need to be 5 man, or you can cheese it out via not completeing the butcher quest line (and keep getting it from the quest giver.)<br />

I would say shoot for 25-30 people that are 60ish, and know how to raid to start doing core.  It's a pretty huge step up from UBRS in terms of difficulty.</div></div><hr />

Thanks.  Seems odd to me that it would be a huge step up from UBRS.  Isn't UBRS about the next most difficult zone compared to MC?  There's nothing in between?  :\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greysen</div><div class="date">05-06-2005, 12:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank intelligent zone design for not including mid sized raid zones.  The content has been gimped out so onyxia/core is doable with smaller groups, but it's still a vast step up from UBRS.  The giants at the zone in hit 800ish, AE for 1k, and take about 1-1/2 to 2 minutes each to kill with a raid group of around 30.  It's not &quot;hard&quot; if you're organized, but just be aware of what you're getting into.</div></div><hr />

Yeah there is a big gap between UBRS and MC/Onyxia.  Meaning for MC/Onyxia you need pretty near to or a full raid of level 60s to really be succesful.  UBRS you can do with much less.  Drakk is very easy COMPARED to those two things.  He is a good fight and accomplishment for up and coming guilds though.  Yeah Wrath legs do still drop off of Rags, we got a pair last night.   :)   But like anything else, if you have the folks and you're motivated, its just about learning the zones and strats for each mob.  Once you do, farm away!</div></div><hr />

garr drops the helm<br />
golemagg drops the BP<br />
magmadar legs<br />
sulfuron shoulders<br />
i think the boots now drop off of shazzrah or the baron. i dont remember. <br />
gauntlets i havent seen yet. i assume if shazz drops the boots then it's the baron that has the gauntlets, or the other way around.</div></div><hr />
