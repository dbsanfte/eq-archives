<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Eals was so happy, he finally got enough AAs to buy his Area Taunt.<br />
<br />
Eals was tanking in HoH, and got the glorious last AA ding and searched thru the AA pages, to Class and bought Area Taunt.<br />
<br />
Eals was happy, he made the hotkey and put it on Hot Buttons.<br />
<br />
He waited for the next pull to try it out and... IT DIDNT WORK!<br />
<br />
Checking... timer is ready, it says Ready on green... he presses the button, still Ready on green... he logs, comes back... still not working... he tries manually with /alt activate... nothing... he petitions.....<br />
<br />
&quot;Im sorry, but I really dont know why it isnt working =(, Im passing it on to a GM level&quot; the good guide said, God bless Guides.<br />
<br />
He got an idea, he owned all the expansions BUT Shadows of Luclin... could that be? But it would be ridiculous.... with PoP, he got all the AAs enabled.... it cant be.... there are PoP AAs that actually require Class AAs.... no way, cause his Archtypes AAs and General AAs are working........... Well.............. Im still waiting on a GM answer, but it SEEMS that you cant activate a Class AA if you dont own Luclin! This would be logical if you couldnt spend points on them at all... but... I BOUGHT the damn AA!...  and all the other ones that DO work.... now Im might need to wait for a damn patch to use my Area Taunt....  or will need to buy Luclin... but yeah, I live in a country where it costs too much to get a copy of Luclin and I dont have the money... is it fair?.... I dont think so....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hmm if he doesnt own SOL then I do not think that the AA will work since they came out of the expansion.  I am not sure but I think you have to have the expansion to be able to use it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you buy the package that has the original EQ and PoP, it comes with all the AAs enabled. Meaning you supposely can use them all. How come I can get all the Passive AAs, but not the activated ones? <br />
Before I had PoP, my AA was all greyed of course, when I got PoP, it enabled ALL the AAs, I can purchase all of them... that should mean they work. I have my Veteran title, 23AAs but I cant use the triggered ones... its just plain dumb.</div></div><hr />
