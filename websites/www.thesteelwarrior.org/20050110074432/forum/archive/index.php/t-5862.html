Jesus Christ, can't they keep a set number and stick with it? It's a fucking nightmare for leadership to have to &quot;choose&quot; or devise a method that determines who gets to have fun today, and who gets to sit at the zone line watching links fly by that the lucky ones were able to get, or participate in getting.<br />
<br />
It's not fair. We're forced to bump up our numbers for a certain encounter, then the next month we're forced to start cutting or &quot;benching&quot; people? It's ridiculous, and I know this topic has been brought up a thousand times before (during LDoN incidentally), and it's about time it stopped.<br />
<br />
I really do not mind at all that events are capped, and I fully understand the reasons for doing so -- but can they at least keep the cap at a constant? If they want to cap events, how about capping them at a lower number, so guilds can run multiple events at once? That can't be done with 42 man raids, or hell, it can't be done effectively with a 36 man raid. I dunno, 24 cap or something? I just find it ridiculous that 60 of my guildmates show up for raids, logging in to have fun, then we have to turn 20  of them away due to the raid cap.<br />
<br />
It's a game. People are supposed to be having fun. It definitely isn't fun being told that you can't join in today, and it definitely isn't fun being the person who relays the new to your guild members.<br />
<br />
Just keep the damn numbers at a constant, so guilds know what to recruit around, and all problems are solved.</div></div><hr />

Ikkiniz Raids 1 - 3 are SUPPOSED to be 54 man raids. The data is - OF COURSE - not live yet, along with 50% of the tuning in those 3(4) zones. All GoD raids (instanced) are supposed to be 54+ man events.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And soon.<br />

54 I can deal with no problems, 42  is pushing it.</div></div><hr />

This is what we've got to look forward to?  My guild did a superb job of retaining members on the way to Time, we over-recruited a bit in the latter elementals, and as a result we have 80+ showing up for Time now.   Have a manageable system in place for that.  But 54?  WTF, do they WANT people to quit?  Because that's exactly what's coming from this.</div></div><hr />

if your car's motor crashes every 100 miles and your AC is breaking every saturday in august, will you buy another car of that brand? probably not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But keep on thinking that!</div></div><hr />

Most guilds who ran through the 72 player POP guantlet can split the guild into two raids to tackle at once assuming its instanced.<br />

Nothing sucks worst than to have one day where you need nearly 100% guild participation and the next you only need 50%.  Benching players makes them feel like the scrub team.</div></div><hr />

Great! When does backflagging start? I am ready to go.</div></div><hr />

thats such BS.<br />
72 / 2 is 36 as you should know, and we all know that if you split the guild into 2 raids, one raid always ends up with 2 clerics, 6 druids, 5 necros.</div></div><hr />

And dont forget the 3-4 SK's also Trondir!</div></div><hr />

yes but if you used 138 people to beat rathe then 138/3 = 46 &amp; is pretty close to 50 so the real solution is that you just have to make sure that your guild is evenly divisible by 54 &amp; youre styling! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trondir</div><div class="date">02-25-2004, 08:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">we beat rathe with 73 fullmembers<br />

 Shadowed, you have to know my main is a wizard. I kinda like SKs and ZBite =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shadowedspawn</div><div class="date">02-25-2004, 09:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah hehe.  I keep trying to get my guild to make a group of 2-3 SK's a bard and the rest wizards, but no luck so far.  I am dieing to get through the GoD trails to get the upgrade version of it but it's not something thats going to happen in the forseeable future.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trondir</div><div class="date">02-26-2004, 03:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">grouping them up like that doesnt make too much sense, every group should have a healer. ZBite is very minor in raids anyways, in groups it has alot more potentional for a wizard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shadowedspawn</div><div class="date">02-26-2004, 03:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">bleh just let em chain nuke until dead then divine rez em.  sort of like interchanging wizards for the sacrifical rangers 8D</div></div><hr />
