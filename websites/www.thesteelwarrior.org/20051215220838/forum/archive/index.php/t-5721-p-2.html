The second time got it single and the pets had been triggered and disappeared so it was only the named, I had –just- been rezed and had no buffs got a few buffs while I tanked her with furious hit defensive, it was real easy. The pets account for 40-60% of the DPS though they are short term. They poped during the fight were mezzed quickly and disappeared before the end of the fight.<br />
<br />
PS I am a elemental geared to around 10k and 1850 ac raid buffed, I think if you can get her with no pets a warrior buffed to 7500 could tank her with defensive easy just get good chanter to CC the 2 adds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Rest seemed pretty accurate. We also had one other named spawn in the Zun room. The one marked 12 spawned behind number 6, but it could be different spawns<br />

/shrug.</div></div><hr />

With Defensive, you might stand half a chance.  At 7kHP, 1700 AC, no defensive, I got rolled like a turtle on the autobahn by the Pxet Elite Blademaster.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Are you saying you got stomped 9400ish hp Buffed at time of encounter?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arathena</div><div class="date">02-23-2004, 12:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, I got stomped 7000 HP with cleric/self buffs. I'm an AC whore, and I have a 132 point AC tap that I use on inc with mobs that I suspect are going to hurt. He went something like 600, 600, miss miss 1600 1600 1600 1600 on the side of my face.</div></div><hr />

Missed that part hehe. 7k and 1700 AC would be a pretty insane anomaly for a warrior :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fenring</div><div class="date">02-27-2004, 01:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The elites seem to spawn on a timer wether or not the previous one is dead. We had 6 Hammermasters up on the way to Rondo and by the time we cleared those and were ready to move through the area another one popped. 7 15 AC augments in about 30 minutes is pretty cool but I suspect it's a bug that they keep spawning.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baxter</div><div class="date">03-07-2004, 07:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hexxt N'Vak Tkan (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=14212)  has a fixed PH in the South Eastern diagonal hallway.  The PH is the mob right at the bend where the hall turns north.<br />
<br />
I can't find its name, but there is a named PH in the South West corner of the Hammermaster room.  Facing the false wall going to Rondo, its the left mob.<br />
<br />
Rav Ptvin (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=14211) has a wandering PH in the North West diagonal hall, sticks to this general area when roaming.<br />
<br />
Rav Hunter (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=14470) has a wandering PH in the South East room where ZMV spawns.<br />
<br />
Both wandering PH share their wandering named pathing.<br />
<br />
The Elites all spawn two shaman-like pets on engage, easily mezable, and they depop after a few seconds of being mezed.  There have been overspawns lately, where there are several of the same Elite spawned right on top of each other.  Monks or FM bards are able to split them.  They all drop level 60 or 65 spells, any era.  Usually berserker Tome's, but sometimes you get lucky with a GoD spell.  The augments they drop are the same every time, and always drop. 2x15AC, 2x25hp/mana/end from the four elites.<br />
<br />
The further south you go into the zone, the greater the mob density and more prevalent the wanderers.  The loot of the named does not scale with this.  The roamers of the south area all spawn in the same spot in the Brawler room, and all wander to the Packmaster area.  There are some roamers who go from the zone ins to the Packmaster and back.  There are low resists on lull, nothing like LDoN where you can go for 5 resists.  Monks/Bards/Enchanters are excellent pullers, so long as you peel from them asap.<br />
<br />
The Ukun are the only mobs I have found that see invis.  Their emote says that they smell you, which is fitting as they are the GoD &quot;dogs.&quot;<br />
<br />
The group I go regularly with brings 2 healers, usually 2 clerics, if we're strapped a very good druid will do.  This isn't so much for my own benefit as it is the chanters.  To speed things along, we always charm a Mastruq Fiend/Warfiend or other warrior type.  Everything is charmable, but these break charm the least often.  They also have the added benefit of not protecting the Enchanter.  The dogs cast an AE dispel when they are charmed and they engage a mob.  We also bring a necro for emergency reses and usually to summon us out in a wipe.  The spawn time for the normal mobs is about 20 minutes, and unless you get to one of the two safe camps in the zone, or get lucky and wipe mid spawn, you're screwed.  Those two camps are as follows (safe because of very little or no roamers and low density): #4, north side where the named PH is; #11, also where the named PH is (SW corner).  Everywhere else you have to be on top of spawn times for the roamers and statics.<br />
<br />
You won't get a good feeling for the zone until you pass the Elites, East or West, afterwhich the zone becomes five times as dangerous.  The exp here is the same as PoP zones (44% mod) and the mobs seem to die as quickly or quicker if you get a charmed pet.<br />
<br />
edit- It's Ukun that see, guess I was tired when writing this.</div></div><hr />
