<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>DennyDarksavior</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I heard that we get a dmg bonus increase at a certain level. Anyone have an idea of when? thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>cazzy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">67 and 70 iirc, i am pos on 70 but not on the other.<br />
<br />
15 dmg bonus on 1h now</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">At 67 it's 14.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dracillion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Don't know if its dmg bonus but my max hit has gone up with every level from 66 to 68 so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Omnus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">at 66 you get 14 db and at 70 you get 15 db<br />
<br />
most people notice alot of damage increases due to skill ups and higher str.</div></div><hr />

These ofcourse would only increase your average DPS, and not affect your max hit... max hit would be affected by the increased damage bonus and/or new damage table (do we get a new damage table ?? )<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: and damage bonus for 2h updates every level if I'm not mistaken, in contrast to 1h damage bonus which jumps 5 ? levels per point</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Neksnappa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You get another 1 damage bonus every 3 levels with onehanders, starting at level 28. So at 67 and 70 you get a bonus of 14 and 15. 2handers, on the other hand, get an increased bonus each level if i'm not mistaken.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nah, this isn't true.  Your level plays a part in the damage calculations making it so your max hit with a partiular weapon will indeed raise every level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gurunt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Actuallly it's not your level, it's your skill cap, and strength cap that can raise max damage.   With low characters you can watch the damage go up within a level if you gear up str gear,  and as the cap goes up.   I think the real stat is raw attack (pre-buffs/worn bonuses).. which strength and skill cap affects.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>GorfinML</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">the DB for 2hers depends on your level and weapon delay...slower 2hers get bigger DB's<br />
<br />
thanks to lucy for http://lucy.allakhazam.com/dmgbonus.html for example between 62 and 62, a 2her with delay of 35 does not incearse in DB, but a 2her with delay of 36 will...<br />
<br />
isnt max hit only affected by your level and weapon damage, where as str/atk affects(effects? arg!) average hit? or am i woefully misinformed?<br />
<br />
ie: at lvl 65 with a 15dmg weapons your max hit will always be 105(number from somewhereinside my ass), whether your str is 100, or 305?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I believe max damage is only affected by the dmg and dmg bonus of a weapon +atk (aka str etc) effects the hit distribution, not the max hit. Every weapon wielded by a given class and level (affecting the DB) will have a given max hit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Actuallly it's not your level, it's your skill cap <br />
<br />
Actually, it is your level.<br />
<br />
60 to 65 you gained no skill caps, and you can keep your strength constant to test it.<br />
<br />
Your maximum hit with a weapon per level is assuming that you have max strength so that you can find it.  People without maxed strength will rarely hit their maximum hit, because their attack rating is too low to hit for that on normal mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Levels 61-65 seem to be &quot;rigged&quot; to give similar max hit improvements even though your skill doesn't go up.<br />
<br />
For those levels that award skill (i.e. 1-40, 50-60, and 66-70), as far as I could tell, it's your skill improvements that raise your maximum hit.<br />
<br />
I believe max damage is only affected by the dmg and dmg bonus of a weapon <br />
<br />
Not true, there's a coefficient, which has always been estimated to be (strength + skill)/100, although nowadays you'd have to also add in those &quot;phantom&quot; increases from levels 61-65 somehow.</div></div><hr />
