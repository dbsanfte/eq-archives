<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>GSW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, i'm getting tired of that see invis bracer and telescope...so. I'm looking for an insant click buff item. Cannot be must equip(has to be clickable from inventory), can't be something like invis, must take up a buff slot, casting time instant, must work in any zone, must be self-only(no switching targets required).  Any suggestions?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kakgumu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Gobby Earing...easy camp or you can buy one in the bazaar for about 5k or less.  Oh and did i mention that it's a 15 atk buff??<br />
<br />
AoN...i just sold mine on Xev for 650k.<br />
<br />
Gobby earing ..... or AoN.....that's an EASY choice in my book.<br />
<br />
Kak</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Gobby earring is must equip and does not stack with some ranger buffs. AoN is your best and most expensive bet.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ring of the Crimson Bull, Gir. It works amazingly well for me. And it drops off a mob we still raid, unlike the ToV stuff.<br />
<br />
It's got a 1 second cast time. But, I don't notice it. It helps me a LOT in Tactics on RZ raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If you're not tanking 1 second cast isnt too big a deal on a clicky.  If you are tanking you have to time your clicks to recast and sometimes you'll need to try a few times before you're successful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I use my crimson bull ring as a junk buff (nice since it's targetable I can put it on other people, my cleric bot in particular) and I can even get it off on a slowed yard trash mob sometimes but during a boss mob fight targeting yourself and casting a 1 sec spell ain't gonna happen.  I use the goblin earring and I miss my Dain ring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bonequest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Blazing Vambraces is nice, adds a DS and 15 FR and is instant click and castable on others.  Bad thing is it needs to be targeted so it kind of sucks if you are needing to cast on yourself and tank.  Also, it doesn't stack with some higher level damage shields.  Drops of Ragefire in skyfire zone durring cleric epic fight and is pretty common.  I think it does have to be equiped though.<br />
<br />
Jboots are instant, self only, and clickable from inventory.  That is what I use if outdoors but it doesn't work inside.  I do wish they would make an upgrade quest to make JBoots so that you could get something like spirit of cheetah or something out of them though...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">There is a nice list of clickies with unlimited charges in library compiled by, yours trully. Saying where they from and what the effect does.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Naubi Fionn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">&quot;does not stack with some ranger buffs&quot; - quote<br />
<br />
It doesn't stack with strength of tunare... and what warrior is going to use that over Brells?</div></div><hr />

<br />
It doesn't stack with strength of tunare... and what warrior is going to use that over Brells?  One that doesn't have a pally in their group. I always keep a couple of junk buffs up in LDoN for the annoying dispelling mobs. Clickies are not always for raids ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Neksnappa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Another option is the Bangle of Disease warding from Grummus in pod. Insta-click, from inventory, but have to target yourself to cast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Blazing Vambraces is nice, <br />
<br />
Yap it must be equipped...but I rather like it anyway</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>GSW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Gobby earring is nice but must equip. AoN casts illusion, i need to be shrunk or woodelf and shrunk when tanking. Jboots works but it's outdoors only. So...still looking!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Derrict</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">coldain ring 8 if you don't have a ranger around for call of the rathe.  doable in 3-5 hours depending on hq kodiak pelt drop rates (or bought from bazaar)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Poosha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Aye, the Coldain rings are sweet.  8 is easy to get even with a single group of 60ish folks... parts can be done with even fewer.  Plus, the 10th ring is nothing to scoff at if you're in a pre-VT guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Geltwip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Yes, as said above, do the coldain ring quests.  It was doable with 1-2 people up until 8, and these days should be able to do up to 9 with only a couple people.  And as far as quests go, its kinda fun to do.  Plus it sets you up to try to get a few groups together to do a ring war for a nice 10th ring for you!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">There aren't many that fit exactly like that.  AoN, Seru head quest earring, Cloak of Thorns are the main ones I can think of.  Jboots too but only outdoors.  Coldain ring quest is an easy one to use, and can easily set up Sars ui for fast switching to use as a click without wearing it most of the time (example shown below, bottom right hand side, left ring is worn right is in a general slot).  Can do the same for gobby earring or AoB click shoulders from Fear.  I agree that targetable ones are too annoying for clicking though.  Sadly spyglass is the only real easy one that matches your requirements that I know of, though for me it's too annoying also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>GSW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Coldain ring is nice, but spending time on it when we're in VT/eles...meh. 10th ring would be a minor upgrade to 1 of my rings, and even though the effect is nice, it's must equip. I might do it(i always wanted one ya know! Just never got to it), but eventually i'll still need a good clicky. <br />
It can not be must equip, illusion, outdoors only, or force me to change targets. Or other such things...In other words, i want to be able to click an item in my inventory(Sars UI here), without any switching items or targets, illusions, or any restrictions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Lynetta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">We just had a monk in our guild solo to 8 in one night. Not THAT much of a time sink.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Tsaotsao</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">The challenge on the coldain ring is sometimes the spawns not coming up. If you have 8 hours straight you should be able to duo it easy enough. There is one mob you could have trouble with.. I think he is on a 12 hour spawn, but I'd have to check. <br />
<br />
I'd read up on the quest and then just start working it. Even if you don't finish quick, you are on the way and when you get slack time, pop over and do some more. <br />
<br />
It's a pain soloing parts, but it's doable.  And a nice break from the grind.</div></div><hr />
