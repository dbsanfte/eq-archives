I was in Najena gathering a train to rampshake because I was bored during the fabled jboots camp. Lots of non aggro mobs that I either kicked or taunted to get them chasing me. Several times along the way I was stunned when trying to aggro the mob, taunt would pop and I pressed it, got no failed message, but didn't get the aggro. This was on non casting mobs that had aggro emotes and happened several times. Just a heads up for those that thought it worked.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now with a spell stun (like rocks falling for 500 or proc for 1500 from krigers) taunt does not work.</div></div><hr />

By successful I mean that the mob stops chasing the other person and turns back on me.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Retnaburn</div><div class="date">03-24-2004, 02:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe it depends on if you are on the aggro list in the first place? All I can confirm is that I successfully taunted while stunned several times and did not aggro the mob.</div></div><hr />
