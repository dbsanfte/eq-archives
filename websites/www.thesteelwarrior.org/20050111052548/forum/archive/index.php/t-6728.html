Any easy way to get out other than gate or have a druid friend port me (if she'll ever log on :P)? I'm considering just agroing a kobold up onto me and dying at the highest part near the ledge, then running back in with an invis potion and dragging my corpse to zone in if all else fails.</div></div><hr />

If you are tired of waiting I can log on my wifes druid, run her there and port you out, take about 5 minutes, her account is up atm just need to log her on and run her there.<br />
<br />
I will hang out here for a couple minutes before logging in myself to see your reply.</div></div><hr />

There is no way out of there except gate, die or CotH.<br />
<br />
Anyone in Velks?<br />
<br />
Try a /who all MAG 55-65 and see if anyone is in GD or Velks or even Thurg.<br />
<br />
Most mages I know find it funny enough and a good enough story to spend the extra couple minutes to come get you.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">04-16-2004, 03:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is a route through the kobold maze which takes you out of the fountain in front of Velk's castle.  From there you are a short run from the village and the route to zone out.  I am skeptical as to whether you can run that whole distance without anything seeing through invis.  I suppose you could try to train your way through the whole route and live, but it's a hard route to find even with a map to follow, if you've never done it before.</div></div><hr />

I got out. I made a halfling rogue named 'savepaynomg' on my 2nd account and gave him 1300p for a gate potion, then hide/sneaked into velks (at level 1) and handed it to myself and gated out. Then I promptly snuck the rogue upto Velketor and tried to solo him. I got him to 100% before I got owned ;)</div></div><hr />
