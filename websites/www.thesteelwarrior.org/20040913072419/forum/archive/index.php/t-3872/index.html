<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cyphan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I wanted to help a guildy get his scabbard and subsequently his epic, so I decided to MQ my note to Kargek to him for the scabbard. He had the Spiroc Wingblade and since thats MQable I assumed it worked vice versa. (BTW I am not really interested in epic anymore, it would be fun to complete but basically would end up bagged...) We did the proper steps and he got nothing. <br />
<br />
Since its always done the other way around Im not sure if anyone really cares, so its just a heads up and to let anyone know who might be interested in doing something like this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>faederya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I did a MQ ranger POS stone last night, 10/25 and worked fine.  MQ is MQ by any other defintion its still an MQ...<br />
<br />
... MQ still works, you did it wrong, sorry for the bad news...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>faederya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I did wizard final wand turn in Halaas last night, 10/26.  Wizard turned in Broken Golem thingee, I did the two wands.  Wizard got note for epic.  MQ worked just fine.  To be on safe side we dit turn in and then invised then hit Give.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cyphan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ive done MQs before and know how they work. Only possiblity for error in the one I tried to do was the person whom I was doing it for had not previously spoken to the quest giver. I had assumed he at least hailed him for the quest for the scabbard when he began the epic quest. Havn't asked him about this yet but its possible the MQ would not of worked because of that.</div></div><hr />
