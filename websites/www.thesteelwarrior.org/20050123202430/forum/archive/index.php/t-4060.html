<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Boff</div><div class="date">11-05-2003, 11:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, after reading about the GBoS being aug'd with AngerIII, I'm pretty hopeful that I'll soon be holding aggro with ease (I use the GBoS and Braid of Golden Hair offhand). Lately, however, I've been using my 2hander alot (Shadowed Torment) and am loving the extra DPS, the lower damage taken, etc. Now here's my question.<br />
<br />
How effective would it be to aug AngerIII into a 2hander with around 40ish delay?<br />
<br />
My guild is currently in VT and looks to be doing PoP w/in a couple months. I'm looking at either the The Sword of Ssraeshza or Great Sword of Pestilence as a viable choice for AngerIII aug.<br />
<br />
TSoS - 52/42  magic dmg-2  xtra planar dmg-7  125 HP  <br />
Eff:LT for 100<br />
<br />
GSoP 40/42  Disease dmg -20  125hp Eff:Scourge<br />
<br />
So should I grab one of these and aug it for a ghetto Blade of War? Or just aug my GBoS and take the hits?</div></div><hr />

One of our guild monks has one of these with just a 150 DD proc in it and he gives me fits trying to keep aggro off of him.  GSo4W with Anger III would be very nice for aggro and dps I would guess.<br />

I'm debating whether to aug my Bloodfrenzy with anger 3 or, my guild just recently downed RZtW, maybe save the aug for a possible BoW or SEWs, would be a while though.  Have pretty much felt 2h&gt;dual wield but at the same time Bloodfrenzy's high proc rate + anger 3 + stormriders carapace or something sounds tempting for tanking named.  Any advice?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I stuck nice cheap 100dd/stun proc on it, and it is wonderful, as well as being stellar dps... not to mention the fact that it's easy as hell to get.</div></div><hr />

Aug'd BBB is nice, but not spectacular. What I mean by that is I can keep agro somewhat better on xp trash and such now, but I still won't trust it for initial MT duty on a boss. The anger process is not all that common as I had hoped. <br />
<br />
Pretty sure anger3's proc rate is about the same as a BoW's. It procs as much as Rune3 does on my SEWS (yes I've done a 6 hour parse).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nayl</div><div class="date">11-08-2003, 05:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Currently wielding a Bloodfrenzy augmented with Force of Ykesha, and a Stone Etched Mallet augmented with Strike of Ykesha.<br />
<br />
I'm one of the top four tanks in my guild.  The other three guys all have augmented BoWs.  I can pull aggro off them without taunting if I don't watch it.  Once I noticed this, I decided that my mission to gain more aggro was complete.<br />
<br />
I get compliments from casters in my experience groups.  The aggro level is high, and its quick.  I did a little parsing and figured out that I'm firing a proc, on average, about once every 9 seconds.  <br />
<br />
My remaining concern is the extra riposte damage I am taking from elemental grade mobs.  Fact is, I've been deliberately meleeing from in front of these mobs lately (not tanking, just doing my inferior dps thing from the front) and the rate of ripostes just isnt that bad.  On your typical EarthB yard trash, I take maybe 2 ripostes the entire fight.  This hardly seems like a compelling reason to ditch my current weapons for a BoW or SeWs.  Have to admit, the added DPS on the 2 handers is still attractive, but DPS isn't my job.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And i rarely loose aggro at all , and the procrate on the BBB is pretty high and it seems augments inherit the procrate on the weapon they are put on cause i proc anger alot as well.<br />
<br />
I did put Anger III on my BoC as well , but its crap compared to the BBB.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerald</div><div class="date">11-11-2003, 01:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's a big thread about it in the Overlord Sanctuary. Basically a SEWS with anger 3 will be a little bit behind a BoWar with anger 3, but it's still more than enough to get the job done all the way through finishing plane of time. If you can't get a BoWar, then SEWS is a very good alternative. Plus the proc is sooo nice for absorbing extra damage.</div></div><hr />
