<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Splaktar</div><div class="date">11-17-2004, 04:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Major Changes<br />
(detailed information for each below)<br />
<br />
Durability<br />
<br />
Item durability costs have been greatly decreased for Superior (blue) and Epic (purple) items.<br />
<br />
Improved Unstuck<br />
<br />
We've added an auto-unstuck feature that you can use prior to petitioning a GM. You can use this feature in situations where you are caught in a part of the terrain and cannot get out. You can find the unstuck option by clicking on the &quot;Help Request&quot; button found on the bottom right hand side of the user interface.<br />
<br />
Spirit Healer<br />
<br />
Using the Spirit Healer now results in a 25% loss in durability for a player's equipped gear and items in inventory, instead of the previous 100% loss. The length of resurrection sickness suffered from using the Spirit Healer has also been decreased to a maximum of 10 minutes.<br />
<br />
Reagents<br />
<br />
Reagent requirements have been removed from the following spells:<br />
<br />
    * Druid: Mark of the Wild<br />
    * Mage: Arcane Intellect<br />
    * Priest: Power Word: Fortitude <br />
<br />
General Changes<br />
(detailed information for each below)<br />
<br />
General<br />
<br />
    * The Daze effect has been reworked to have a smaller chance of occurring against players level one to 29. The chance of a successful Daze effect against players 30 and above remains the same. <br />
<br />
Talents<br />
<br />
    * The Improved Renew talent has been reduced in effectiveness per rank.<br />
    * The effect chance of Seal of Command has been reduced slightly.<br />
    * Redoubt now lasts either 10 seconds or five blocks, whichever comes first.<br />
    * The effect of Improved Moonfire has been reduced per rank. <br />
<br />
Druid<br />
<br />
    * Bear Form has been improved to hold aggro more effectively.<br />
    * Growl: removed rage cost and global cooldown.<br />
    * Cower: increased the effect, added a cooldown. <br />
<br />
Paladin<br />
<br />
    * Judgment: Moved to level 4.<br />
    * Divine Protection: Moved to level 6.<br />
    * Purify: Moved to level 8.<br />
    * Seal of the Crusader: Now introduced at level 6. <br />
<br />
Rogue<br />
<br />
    * Feint: increased the effect, added a cooldown. <br />
<br />
Shaman<br />
<br />
    * New Spell: Reincarnation (Level 30). Reincarnation is a passive ability that will give you the option of letting you resurrect yourself once every half hour upon death. <br />
<br />
Warlock<br />
<br />
    * Inferno: Now dismisses your pet before casting to allow the Infernal to start Enslaved. Useable outdoors only. <br />
<br />
Warrior<br />
<br />
    * Defensive Stance has been improved to hold aggro more effectively.<br />
    * Taunt: removed rage cost and global cooldown. <br />
<br />
Bug Fixes<br />
<br />
    * Night Elf characters in Wisp form will now have correct collision detection.<br />
    * Damage modifiers will now be calculated before armor points are considered, instead of after.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Splaktar</div><div class="date">11-17-2004, 04:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">While this does hopefully address 1 of the major Warrior concerns (aggro), it doesn't seem to address the other issues.  The biggest thing missed seems to be the dodge/miss/block/parry/deflect problem.  I had a human today parry me 8 times in a row.  I was level 12, and the human was level 8.  It just doesn't make sense to fail to land a hit that much.  No magic class has their spells resisted nearly that much.  The most I've seen for spell resists is maybe 2-6% of the time, certainly not more than 10%.  While we're failing to land blows 40-60% of the time.<br />
<br />
It does seem to bring the Paladin back in line with the Warrior... to some extent.. but I don't know if it's enough.<br />
<br />
The shaman seems to have gotten stronger?<br />
<br />
Most of the changes seem positive and much needed though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gorlab</div><div class="date">11-17-2004, 04:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The biggest problem was rage not agro, you could generate agro if you had the rage for it.  This patch does not appear at first glance to do anything to fix the problems introduced last patch.</div></div><hr />

Will have to see come release.</div></div><hr />

Its too late already.  Beta ends Thurs and they are burning the CD's for release right after.  This is it for WoW Warriors until after release.  I hope they change taunt to a 5 sec cooldown instead.</div></div><hr />
