<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Monglok</div><div class="date">10-09-2003, 04:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm currently at lvl 25 and I've been in Upper Guk farming Spider Silks for far longer than I'd like to admit. My question is this, where can I go that would be good exp and still be able to farm something for PP? I don't buy ebay gear or anything like that and choose not to because of morality reasons, anyways, the gear that I have equiped is from massive amounts of farming Silks and Bone Chips. I'd like to be able to upgrade some gear while EXP'n, any hints to that would be appreciated as well.<br />
<br />
PS<br />
I've solo'd the majority of my time mainly because of a lack of &quot;Good&quot; players around my lvl on Sullon Zek that aren't twinked out by their mains and have massive attitudes because my gear is that of a lvl 65 Warrior.<br />
<br />
Thank you for any help.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xenephex</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 12:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is old-world advice because that's where I was at your level.  There are probably better options now.  Also, I've never played on a Zek server so I don't know what the peculiarities of that may be. <br />
<br />
First of all, I soloed a warrior into the low 50's and I can tell you that at your level it is going to be increasingly difficult to solo unless you get some type of regen item.  An Iksar BP might do you for a few more levels, but after that you're going to need a Fungi - that's a lot of spider silks (or in my case a lot of leather paddings). <br />
<br />
I believe you can still get exp from Crag Spiders in EK, and you will get a lot of silk from them.  The poison is going to be a problem for you though if you try to solo. <br />
<br />
South Ro around Paw should still be good exp and moderately ok loot at your level, but you will need a group or partner.  Inside Paw is even better exp, but you will definitely need a group for that. <br />
<br />
Then, the old standard - High Hold Keep.  Decent loot and very good exp.   Depending on your server and play time, it can be next to impossible to get in a group, though.  Maybe that has changed now. <br />
<br />
However, if I were you, I would in general plan on separating exp from farming at your level.   You are probably going to make better plat from farming silks or stuff for padding than you will in any zone that's available for exp - and your exp is going to have to be in a group unless you do some significant equipment upgrades. <br />
<br />
Then there's always LDoN.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As Xenephex said, I would split farming from XPing. My favorite farming these days... Swirling Shadows in the corner of Shadeweaver's Thicket where all the undead sit on the hill. The tunnel to Paludal is just below. Kill the Lesser Shades for Shadows ( 45-60pp per in Bazaar), Shadeling silks (1-2 pp per) and the other undead for bone chips.... Adds up for us.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Osyris</div><div class="date">10-11-2003, 10:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since you're on sullon zek, it'd help to know if you are good, neutral or evil. but since you're hunting in Upper guk I'm going to assume you are evil. <br />
  I wouldn't go to High keep, that's normally owned by neutral people.  With gear like that, I'd hunt in sol A, in the room with the goblin merchant (so you don't have to worry about the goblins running) they drop stuff like 0-6pp each, FS, small brick of ore 3pp, large brick or ore 7-10 pp, and poison components 1-3pp if you get lucky you can make over 15pp on one goblin sometimes. The only problem are some of them are casters. And if you're not KoS to the Gnomes you can sell the to gnome merchant in the zone. I did 20-34 with my untwinked paladin a couple years ago. <br />
  Another good spot for a solo/exp camp at your level is the undead island in OOT. kill the gargoyles and sometimes if a couple skeletons beat a gargoyles down, you can help the gargoyle out right before it dies and then kill it for the exp/loot. This should be good exp till around 30-32. all the gargolyes can drop eyes, They sell for 10 pp each and a gargoyle can drop up to 3-4 of them. The good thing about this camp is that it's really easy to single pull here and there's lots of safe spots to bandage up.<br />
  Once you get to around 35 or so you might want to head over to warsilks woods in kunark and camp the Shrunken goblin skull earrings, those are worth a few K each in the bazaar, and a must have for all raiding warriors for the insta buff effect.<br />
  Also, for 100 plat or so you can get yourself an embalming dagger. it procs summon bandage (1/2 amount of your level) It's not a fungi, but it's nice to have.<br />

These drop a lot of fine steel weapons that sell pretty good.  Or find a group in MSeru.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarevok Gibran</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 08:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">sol a would be the best choice for you, excellent exp, gobbies drop pp, fine steel, and often drop flame agate (stackable and sell for 9pp per), do random goblin camps till 30 (bar, foreman, predator, etc) then at 30 try and get king till 34 or so, at 34 you can do gnomes until 40, making a lot of pp along the way</div></div><hr />
