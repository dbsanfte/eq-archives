We usually never, even post patch had a problem with cornering TZ / Saryn but now when im in corner it pushes me out. This patch blows, now everytime something touches a wall it gates to bind. The only thing that semi worked was being grown on TZ max then not standing all the way in it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">04-01-2004, 07:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think they will have to retune the mobs, a dev member had said shortly after kunark that cornering wasnt an intended ability but since they couldnt fix it they would tune future mobs with it in mind ( making it an intended ability)<br />
<br />
question now is, will we have the ability to corner returned to EQ, or will EQ see a drop in mob power.<br />
<br />
most high end people i know now just addapt by boxing the mob(using pushback to keep em facing the tank and not the DPS people) but that has limited success</div></div><hr />

Theyre all fine really.</div></div><hr />

Great for the Ramp. Tank/Knight, but crappy for the MT since they end up being at max melee distance by it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krassus</div><div class="date">04-01-2004, 10:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don’t know whats wrong, we were fine after the patch. Just last night all of a sudden TZ / VZ and Saryn went into the walls or were skipping warping in and out. I had slight success by growing and standing about 2 feet of wall being under TZ’s nuts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Derrict</div><div class="date">04-01-2004, 10:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Saryrn &amp; CT won't corner for us, either.  I didn't see any issues with the other Gods for us last night, though Inny warped at the end when he got pushed in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goradain</div><div class="date">04-01-2004, 10:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Seru was fun last night.  At one point he completely disappeared for about 5 seconds, then popped up a few feet away from us AEing all the casters.  Add to that the 20+ second lag spikes (yes, the entire zone was doing it) and you got yourself a nervewracking fight.  Fortunately it seemed that not only did we lag out, the mobs did, too.  Our MT never died and was always around the same health when the spikes ended.  There were less than 30 people in the zone.  I'm hoping that problem gets fixed soon.<br />
<br />
Seru was moving very odd, too.  He didn't walk, just kinda scooted along the floor (I've only fought him once before, but I'm pretty sure his legs moved before).  His only real animation was a sort of half-hearted attempt at swinging his sword.<br />
<br />
Loot sucked.  A BBB and 2 Horsies.  /sigh<br />
<br />
Not really related to the topic, just more fun with the new engine.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Barboki</div><div class="date">04-01-2004, 11:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We did Time last night.  Only got to phase four due to the patch blowing our first night.  TZ/VZ cornered fine.  TT pushed our tank out at the start but settled down to normal.  Sayryn on the other hand climbed the corner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Niafix</div><div class="date">04-01-2004, 11:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">uh. copied from my other post:<br />
<br />
If you haven't figured out why you're falling through the wall, it's because monsters have a bit of pushback when they melee, just like a PC, and in most cases they do quite a bit more pushback. Well, when you back yourself tight into a corner, this melee pushback will push you through the wall, and make you fall through the world.<br />
<br />
Obviously there are 2 simple fixes;<br />
<br />
The first being not to corner the mob. That's right, you heard it here first kids, not all beastmonsters have to be cornered in order to win. In fact, none do! wooot.<br />
<br />
Secondly, if you really do want to corner the beastmonster, you could try backing into a corner, then pressing the forward arrow key, or whatever key you have bound to the forward movement action. In most cases, especially with larger beastmonsters, you can still effectivly &quot;corner&quot; without being completely backed into the corner. It works wonders <br />
<br />
AE rampage monsters and knockback monsters can be treated very similarly. The MA would stand at a corner, but a few steps out, so that he is in melee range while backed up all the way. If he gets knockbacked, he would just move back up to his spot. For AE rampage monsters, what works is having the nukers facing away from the mob, pushing him out toward the melee, and the melee pushing him back in the corner, if one side is out pushing the other, then some of the melee can angle toward the side, or a nuker can face toward the monster and help the melee. Take a look at this picture, it describes what I'm talking about.<br />

One of our clerics did manage to fall under the world on port in to P5 and land in the GY for 20k, but other than that, i can't think of any cornering issues we had</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Surlok</div><div class="date">04-02-2004, 09:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We only corner Saryn Terris and RZ in time,However found on those that not shrinking at all worked excellent,It seems like the corner size was increased or I don't know but a full Sized Ogre could Corner RZ np and I cornered both Saryn and TT without being Shrunk as a barb.<br />
<br />
Fully cornered there was enough space for me and iksar monk and a Halfbreed ranger to stand ,between the corner and the God...<br />
<br />
I actually like it better thsi way than having to shrink.....<br />
<br />
The rest of the Gods including VZ/TZ we fight out in the open so I can't comment on those.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krassus</div><div class="date">04-02-2004, 11:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We had no problems last night on TZ actually in the corner, i used grow and stood a bit out from corner and he was right on me and didnt get pushed in. Fight went perfect.<br />
<br />
VZ kept warping like some ish. Then some necro WTD on enc corpse and pet charmed and hasted VZ YES!!!!! woot</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sythrak</div><div class="date">04-02-2004, 10:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just use Ogre illusion and your fine cornering anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pling</div><div class="date">04-04-2004, 07:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just tried Saryrn (Time) with Gnome, Small Ogre, Ogre and nothing worked. Saryrn is a wuss anyway but definately not cornerable sunday 5 april 2004.<br />
<br />
Didn't try enlarged Gnome though.<br />
<br />
Rest of phase 4 was cornerable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aonodorus</div><div class="date">04-04-2004, 11:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah saryrn didn't wanna corner, bertoxx rewound me a few times outta the corner, but then he stopped.  Other than those 2, everything else went perfectly fine into corners, tz/vz included</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Madronedorf</div><div class="date">04-05-2004, 12:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As most have said Saryn didnt work at all for us, CT wouldnt corner either thi (in ct room)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Choppin</div><div class="date">04-05-2004, 01:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">haven't been in time since last week. but saryrn and CT were both uncornerable. we came up with a theory that since we attempted to corner them in &quot;unsolid&quot; corners (pillar in saryrn room, p5 port-up room for CT, right of the door) they would get pushed inside the walls... haven't had the chance to test it but would like to know if anyone has tried cornering CT or saryrn in the &quot;outer map-walls&quot; in time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aielman</div><div class="date">04-05-2004, 07:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We didn't have a problem getting and keeping the mobs in the corner, nor did we push them through the walls. We had a problem that it would kick the warrior out of the corner. Had the problem for TZ, Saryrn and VZ in tier 4. RZ worked fine as did Inny, and we tanked Bert and CT in the open, so I don't know what was up for them.<br />
<br />
peace,<br />
