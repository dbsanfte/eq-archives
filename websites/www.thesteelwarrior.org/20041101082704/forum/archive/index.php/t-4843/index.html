<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Minna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all, first time here, so please go easy on me hehe.  Here's my deal.  I recently started up a guild with some close friends, and am now in the position of being the MT.  I have been working very, very hard and I think I can say at this point I am not a poorly equipped warrior.  But I am feeling very frustrated as of late.  It just doesn't seem like I am the warrior we need atm.  My friends always seem to look elsewhere when they want a truly good tank, and it really gets me down.  But even without that, I still don't feel like I am tanking as well as others I group with from time to time.  BoT is the main zone I play in atm, and we don't have access to Tactics or Elementals yet at this point.  So any advice on skills to work on in aa, or gear to aim towards that is pre-elemental would be more than appreciated.  I just want to be that warrior, that people look for when they really need one.  I already have the rep in skill, but sadly gear just doesn't seem to cut it.  Aggro generation really isn't the issue atm, I am looking for better tanking ability mainly.  Magelo to the left.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">One starter is replace Sash with Soulscream Belt. Easy to get with 1 group out of Veksar, better stats, more AC, same haste.<br />
<br />
 I'd also look for a different neck, but not gonna recommend there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fenring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">As far as AA get ND3 asap then PE and PD3. Your gear isn't bad, if you can do BoT towers get ornate bp or do Kael and get vindi BP. Strength of the Elements would be a good upgrade for your shoulders or the shoulders from Vakhiz in PoN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Warfust</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You could get a nice HP boost out of new sholders. And a decent HP bump by getting Crinose Cape of the Werewolf for your back.<br />
<br />
And would also do all HP AA before going back to defensive ones. (ND, PE, PD).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Myst Darkwind</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">More than anything in POP its just AA, Get All the HP and Mitigation AA you can (Planar Power, Planar Durability. LR5 ID 5 CA3 CS3 ND3 SE and TM.) Those will massively help you.<br />
<br />
Grind those out and then work on offensive but I cant stress how massively those will change how well you tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Minna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yeah,  HP aa is my focus now.  Only reason I did CA3 and CS3 first is, one my main xp grind groups I use a druid as healer, and even with only druid buffs, she couldn't heal my full hp anyway so I was trying to maximize the efficiency of the hp I had.  We are keyed for towers, ornate bp is on my list but I can't field enough players from the guild atm to do Einride on my own, or enough to get loot rights in my guild alliance.  Only about 8 players atm capable of getting into BoT(we are new, but growing fast, so won't be much longer).  We are still working on flagging some new members, and leveling.  Some upgrades on my list are ornate boots, stonewood bow, and amygdalan mask.  Though on my server these will be around 300k if not more to get, so gonna be a while.  Shoulders I have been at a complete loss at.  There is absolutely nothing for sale on my server that would be an upgrade (the bazaar on Maelin is abyssmal).  Though I can field a fairly sizable force with access to anything pre BoT/HoH.   THough we do have a fairly solid core atm.  We regularly do wing bosses and tower mini's whenever we can find them up.  Usually with one group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Neksnappa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Previous gear/aa suggestions are great, working towards them will give you the better tanking skill you want.<br />
<br />
One other piece of fairly easily obtained gear that would be an upgrade would be a Shaderock Amulet, which drops of the Va'Dyn in Akheva Ruins. A fairly well geared/skilled group or two shoud\ld be able to get him, which makes it a great foray to do before or after a guild raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yeah just max out your hp and defensive aa's and you'll get that boost you're looking for. An item or two will give you next to nothing compared to the aa's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>levonbaird</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">just try what i did which is i let the people from my group run away as a train of 4 mobs atked me and although i died after killing 2 of them my friends ran away to the wayfarers camp which i happed 2 have binded my soul 2 so then they though that i was a ok tank<br />
by the way get some more hits because that really helps and im only lvl 9 so i didnt lose my items</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Your gear is on par or maybe better than mine and I have no problems tanking in BoT.  If your skills are typical, and if you have a problem tanking, then<br />
1) you have unrealistic expectations of yourself.  We are not Conan, able to slay mobs left and right.  We are defensive tools that pin down the enemy until others kill them.  I had unrealistic expectations of myself and it got me down.  I finally realized it, and am doing better now. Or...<br />
2) the problem lies in your groupmates.  there is no amount of warrior skill or gear that can overcome an overnuking wizzie, chain stunning pally, or a bad puller.<br />
<br />
AAs will help.<br />
<br />
First, get Area Taunt.  It is the best AA we get, though it's importance is somewhat reduced as of late.  But when you get the two-pull, and you can get both mobs' attention long enough for a mez to land, you'll be a happy person.  Chances are, no one will realize what you did :-D<br />
<br />
After AT, keep cranking the defensive AAs even when it sucks to do so.<br />
<br />
Also, if you have DPS in your group, don't be afraid to go defensive and conserve the healer's mana if things get a little tight.<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-<br />
<br />
Is your magelo correct? You seem to have great gear for a 199 STA.   Your AC is great.  I'd work on STA and HPs.  We're both pre-elemental, my magelo link is below.  Note the shoulders.  Big STA and easy to get.<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-<br />
<br />
EDIT - another suggestion. If you are with friends, ask them what they think you can do to improve your play.  It could be something as simple as, &quot;On the pull, call out the name of your targetted mob consistently.  You only do it one pull in 3 and it is annoying.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kiya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Your gear looks quite good, about the only thing I could think of is finding some shoulders with HP/STA.  I had IGS for ages, and I was quite glad to be rid of them!  <br />
<br />
I'd work on your HP and defensive AA's.  After you get area taunt, anyways.  I would suggest this succession for them: AE Taunt, ND3, PE, PD3, then work up LR5 and ID5. I've noticed quite a difference in tanking with just getting LR4, I'm excited to see how well I will hold up once I get ID5.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Doomflayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I would like to see your friends magelos, I am quite frankly sick to death of casters bagging on Warrior equipment when their SUCKS! Do your friends have boots of flowing slime? Those are cheaper than your gauntlets! Casters going to others to tank, when their gear sucks deserve to be dumped for a new group. I personally can not wait till WoW comes out, and these casters run into Warrior that don't need them! Where it is possible to have all Warrior groups.<br />
I was in your shoes once, and I asked the Shaman what her Wisdom was....138, FREAKING 138, then I bagged on her everyday about my Twink Druid have over 200 easy while her sorry main had a 138 wisdom. You would be shocked at how bad some casters equipment is.<br />
If you were On Maelin Starpyre hook up with Mondrieg, his cleric has GROSS mana (plus 25FT or something nuts, to bad about the cap). Then bag on your friends chars on how bad they are.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Malek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Go with either shoulder Ketel suggested, sell your splitblade if you need the cash and replace that with a droga wep, which I highly recommend camping over buying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Regarding bad caster gear...  Casters are very effective nekkid. We're not.  In fact, most of our effort in EQ revolves around finding ways to get new gear.  Casters have a different perspective, especially if all they are doing is cranking exp in PoP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Malek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">And still they whine how they gotta buy spells, as if that's a valid argument.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mondrieg's mana pool made it so Smashem (MA) was able to chain pull mobs in any of the Elemental planes he cared to. If the Cleric is never out of mana, you can pull forever. It damn well does matter what gear casters have!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>HamkChai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">ur equipments seem quite adequate for ur playground i would say. half set of ornate + 2x tactics earrings is better than what i have when i was 1st in BoT (back in the days when BoT still needs PoStorm quest to get into it) :)<br />
<br />
like other posters said, what u are lacking probably is the defensive AA and hp AA. personally i would suggest u go tho defensive AA 1st (especially CA3 -&gt; LR5. i would regard LR5, while at the same cost as ID5, would give u better tanking result, but that's pretty much discussed in other threads) b4 hp AA, but maybe that's just me ;) <br />
<br />
if u are still seeking gear advice,<br />
1) drop ur IGS. there are some new shoulders around that give u pure hp or nice sta, and are easily accessible. examples are:<br />
a) Dingy Pauldron of Brawling - MoN quest shoulder (14ac 40hp and some resist). those quest items are all dropable, and quite common (compared to ToD ones anyway :p )<br />
b) Crystallized Acid Pauldron - CT drop from the (in)famous slime ring (25ac 50hp). this shoulder should not cost u too much, as usually this is what we called by-product by small guilds which farm slime ring for daggers and bracers.<br />
c) XXXX Dragonwing Mantle - old school velious shoulder dropped by various dragons in WW. these nowadays probably go very cheap, and still gives good hp for some higher class ones (&gt;Heavy)<br />
d) Chokidai Hide Pauldrons - chardok drop (5ac -10str 15sta 55hp). probably the best shoulder b4 ur sta is caped. still quite valuable because of the usable classes.<br />
e) some newer shoulders from LDoN. they are going cheaper and cheaper because of the rarity (too common) and the high recommended level. keep an eye on them<br />
2) bracers. imo, ornate bracers for warrior (or for any melee classes) is a waste of pp (no matter u camp it urself [thus u can sell it] or u buy it from bazaar). try get urself 1 or 2 friends and go MoN / ToD to farm faction, and complete the Chardok ring quest. ring2 has 85hp, and the finally reward (12ac 5sta 100hp AoB) is a cord that can be equiped in arm / wrist / shoulder slots. quite a big upgrade as u wont be able to find good hp items for those slots (except shoulder)<br />
3) feets. the boots u are using is good. but if u want more hp then u can consider switch to kingly boots (65hp, from ToD) or chokidai boots (15sta 40hp, from chardokB). both are quite low on ac, but the hp u gain will probably offset it.<br />
<br />
hope this help</div></div><hr />

<br />
I never said that gear didn't matter.  I said that casters were effective without gear.  Obviously they are better WITH gear. Duh.  A cleric can drop several CHs when naked.  Chanters can still mez mobs.  I bet there isn't a warrior in the game that can take down, say, the single specter in feerott without gear.<br />
<br />
The point is since we are 100% dependent on gear, we have to put all our effort into getting better gear lest we fall 'behind the curve'.  Casters could spend their time tradeskilling if they wanted to.  Then they'd sell us their product.  :-/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Celestias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Spirit Wracked Cords are good for bracer or shoulders or arms too.. 100hp 5 sta aura of battle chardok queen quest if your up for faction work and spawns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Minna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I'm quite hesitant to give up the sbod atm, I love the extra ac it gives me.  I had the sword of the bloodsworn and chos combo for the longest while, don't really see a difference in aggro between the 2.  Just finished grinding out the ldon's for the points to get the anger 3 aug, now am working on making the weapons to put them on.  I plan on making the 17/20 club and 16/19 sword out of ldon, with dual anger 3 procs.  Finished up ND3, PE, and up to LR2 now.  The aa's made a huge difference in my ability to take a hit as well as a nice hp boost.  Still looking for shoulders, might take the guild down to do ring of slime to see if we get lucky on the drop.  There is absolutely nothing for that slot buyable on my server, kinda sucks.  I think atm that the aa's were what I really was missing.</div></div><hr />

Forget the gear (although excellent suggestions above).  <br />
<br />
Some hard questions for you:<br />
<br />
1. Have you asked your &quot;friends&quot; why they go elsewhere to find a tank?<br />
<br />
2. What *exactly* do you think you are not tanking as well as others at (take too many hits, can't hold agro, etc.)?<br />
<br />
3.  Have you made it clear to people that you WANT &amp; EXPECT to MT?<br />
<br />
I think the last question is a very common mistake.  Some folks don't want to be rude and &quot;ask for the ball&quot;.<br />
<br />
Anyway please take these as constructive questions brother warr ;-)</div></div><hr />
