Ornate is another obvious route to go, if you have access to Sol Ro.<br />
<br />
With LDoN refunding items too doing Takish-Hiz for some of the high end plate armor wouldn't be a bad idea either, but it's a pretty long process.</div></div><hr />

First off lose the damn main hand... SBoD is an overrated  warrior-only weapon, that belongs to a ranger/rogue, not a warrior.  Try to grab a GBoS or CHSD, if not, look into CHoS.  You're pretty much maxed on cheap droppable gear, unless you want to dish out 200K for acid bracers/RZ helmet, or other &quot;high end&quot; droppable gear, my best suggestion is to start raiding, or if thats not an option or desire for you, you got plenty of AAs to work on, Defensive/HP.  You can get probably another 1k+ hp just from ur AAs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frostpaw</div><div class="date">07-15-2004, 06:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kitas nailed it, but id go so far as to say sell both of those weaps and get CHoS/SoTB combo. I know that gets recommended on this board a lot, but those are generally the best droppable war 1handers available for cheap. Should leave ya lots of nice plats to buy armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azaza</div><div class="date">07-15-2004, 08:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">While the cultural armor is great for sta and hps, I'd keep an eye out for similar gear but with some resists. You should shoot for 100 in all resists (to start with anyway). Fire +6 augs have been rare for me, but I've seen lots of Poison augs by comparison.<br />
<br />
In no particular order, CA3, Planar Durability/Power 2, TM1, WA2, Fero 1/2, LR, ID (after LR).<br />
<br />
Velium Gemmed is a nice dps weapon when you're not MT, but dual aggro proc weapons (meaning 2 aggro procs on the weapon, not necessarily dual wield as well) are practically a necessity to MT.</div></div><hr />

Pardon my ignorance but I just came back to EQ after a long break, GboS and CHSD? I knew the copper hammer of stirking those 2 I do not</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, the Droga pair (see my magelo for their stats) will be a huge bonus for agro:<br />
Copper Hammer of Striking (King Camp)<br />
Sword of the Bloodsworn (Seer Camp, just upstairs from King)<br />
<br />
You're current combo looks very good for dps, but unless you're planning on pretending to be a ranger in groups, I'd swap them both out quick unless you have some ldon proc augments in them that aren't shown in your profile.<br />
<br />
Your armor looked pretty decent, you actually have more hp than me and I buffed to just a hair under 8k with tribute and raid buffs...but I deliberately gave up about 100 hp for 50 ac.  The shade would be a good option to upgrade your shoulders...for AA's, see the AA thread, it's pretty straightforward except deciding what you need most (more hp, ac or agro).<br />
<br />
** EDIT **<br />
Ok, I looked at your profile and I'm confused.  You have WA1, but you have no weapon proc's save your bow?  WA does no good for agro without a proc'ing weapon.  Maybe the aa thread should be updated to clarify that if it doesn't already.</div></div><hr />
