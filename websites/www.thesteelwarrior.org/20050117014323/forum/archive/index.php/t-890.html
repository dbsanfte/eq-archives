<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Newcleus</div><div class="date">05-29-2003, 08:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello again, another equipement question. Last night I dinged 13, which means the sheild went in the bank and I whipped another sword. Here is where my questions lay.<br />
<br />
Ok, at level 13, which of these two would you use, and in which hand (these are what I have, if you have any other recommendation, please tell, If it's cheap enough i could sell some of these):<br />
<br />
Lamentation<br />
Defiance<br />
Jagged Blade of Mourning<br />
Wurmslayer<br />
Kunzar Ku'juch<br />
<br />
And, do you think it will be a good idea to swap to these at 36 (when they are recommended and both Proc i believe)<br />
<br />
Venomous Axe of the Velium Brood<br />
Barnacle Covered Axe<br />
<br />
I think these should last me for quite a while. At least until stuff I'm fighting drops better. Thanks again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gonaden</div><div class="date">05-29-2003, 08:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Wurmslayer in primary and Jagged Blade in secondary would give you the most DPS.  Addmittedly its not the fastest combo out there, but at your level you will have no trouble holding aggro with that pair.<br />
<br />
I was using a Wurmslayer right up to level 35 or so, loved it to bits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Friedrick</div><div class="date">05-29-2003, 09:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Up until lvl 20 when the damage cap is lifted, I would use JBoM mainhand and Lammy/Defiance offhand.  Then I would switch to the Wurmslayer mainhand until 45 or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Braeorn</div><div class="date">05-29-2003, 09:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you want to be a speedfreak, go lammy/defiance. If you want pure DPS, go Wurm primary, sell the rest and buy an LSoEE.<br />
<br />
With Wurm and LSoEE you'll churn out great dps for you level until you find the wurmy too slow (I dumped around 40), then go speed.<br />
<br />
Braeorn Battlekrye<br />
64th Warrior<br />
Povar</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Newcleus</div><div class="date">05-29-2003, 09:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Only problem with the LSOEE is they are hard to find, and way overpriced (15-20k) on Maelin. I don't think I could get that much for all my other weapons combine =) and I definitely don't have that kind of cash. Or is 15-20k average? Just doesn't seem to me to be worth that much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Braeorn</div><div class="date">05-29-2003, 09:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeow...they're plentiful on Povar and run 6k'ish. Its not worth more than that IMO since you'll be ditching it at some point for a better aggro item.<br />
<br />
Amazing how different economies can be...whats a centi longsword run? thats a decent offhand for your wurm too.<br />
<br />
Braeorn</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Newcleus</div><div class="date">05-29-2003, 09:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I very rarely see Centi LS in bazaar and it's usually 4-6K. Centi SS runs 600-1k. This server is very up and down, and the 'cooloer' more popular stuff can be rare or expensive. Most of what I've gotten has been when it was on it's downside, for example I got the Barnacle Axe and Venomous Axe for 300pp each, now they are in the bazaar for around 2-3k. the Kunzar I got for 100pp, the Wurmy for 900pp. But a Glowing Black Sword is averaging 2500 now. I remember someone giving me one on 7th hammer because they couldn't sell it and didnt want it (post 45)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Newcleus</div><div class="date">05-29-2003, 12:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Any of you happen to be on Maelin, that would willing to accept some cash and trades, since I haven't got nearly enough cash to buy one? I have some decent bows on my ranger and stuff (Nightmarewood, Darkwood Bow of Suffering)</div></div><hr />
