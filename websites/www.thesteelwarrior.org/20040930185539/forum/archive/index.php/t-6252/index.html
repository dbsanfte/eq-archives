<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sorrowsong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">hiya got another qns abt ikkinz raids.<br />
<br />
we've done trials 1 ..and shld complete 2 3 soon...<br />
<br />
got a rough idea of what is needed for collection etc...but just need to clarify...<br />
<br />
do we need summoner ring to open raids?  do we need ageless relic protector to open raids?  <br />
<br />
the amount of items to collect from both ground spawns and name mobs is just downright confusing :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bohkah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No, Summoner ring isn't required to open up raids.<br />
<br />
Yes, you do have to kill Ageless Relic protector.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'd not touch summoner ring unless I was 100% sure we could kill it. It does not repop, the spawned mobs are invulnerable if trained outside. It makes it a total pita to move to ikkinz raid area if that ring is up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Throag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You can gate the Rav back to the ring and they won't bother you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">the ravs maybe, but not 6+ golems</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">They fixxed that I think, and ageless relic protector isnt needed for raid access if you know keywords for raid access (flesh parchment quest is)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sorrowsong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">They fixxed that I think, and ageless relic protector isnt needed for raid access if you know keywords for raid access (flesh parchment quest is) <br />
<br />
<br />
hmm keywords? what i know abt this particular portion of task is to Combine Minor Relic of Energy x 4 in the bag and give it back to the dwf... this isnt sufficient? hmm or is the protectors relic of energy the final item needed?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">once you do the fleshed glyphment part if you just say the names of raids you want you get them even tho he doesnt give the keywords to you  to you, the script is a little broken on him i think becuase there are so many paths. none of the relic/minor relic part is required to get raids</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sorrowsong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">ah those the rest is just part of Qvic key? ic ic</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">i really dont know what the martyrs passage/pit of damned part leads to, i've done raid access on two chars first one i didnt get keywords for raid access or the text to it until i did Pit of damned AND Glyphed flesh, then when i did it again after i did the flesh tradeskill mini quest i tried saying one of keywords for the raid and it worked...<br />
<br />
Think its<br />
<br />
Sanctuary of Righteneous (sp)<br />
Sanctuary of the Glorified<br />
Sanctuary of the Transcendent</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Bohkah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Are you sure this isn't a bug?  Anyway, Tublik didn't give me raids until i finished crumbled sanctuary/Pit of the lost.   I had already done Martyr's Passage/Temple of the damned before that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I completed the Flesh Patch task thing before even beginning the other two and recieved raid access. The three tasks are separate from each other. Like one of the above posters, I didnt receive any keywords from the dorf, I discovered I had raid access by just asking about the three raids by name &quot;Sanctuary Righteousness&quot;, &quot;Sanctuary Glorified&quot;, &quot;Sanctuary Transcendant&quot; and was given the raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">does everyone need to do the kodaz trials to proceed through the game or no?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">its really not known, for now the answer is no but it might change for final zone</div></div><hr />
