Well I was playing my re-roll warrior the other day in an LDON adventure and I saw the emote that the other warrior in the group got hit by a stone.  So I asked him what he did and he said that he got rooted and that it breaks root to use that stone throw disk</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">A good warrior has enough MR to never get rooted ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
throw stone is on the same timer than incite, so you can't chain them (like bash/kick/slam).<br />
<br />
 Throw Stone disc... *cheers* for 2 damage crit blasts!  <br />
<br />
cool !!! you can know use finishing blow while throwing stone, I can imagine a 1Domage hit crits for 32000!!! <br />

<br />
there is a special emote when a NPC/PC is hited by a stone ??? <br />
I've never seen much difference in animation whatever I Kick/Bash/Slam/Crush/Slash/Pierce/Arrow_Pierce what is my target, so why would it be different with a flying stone in a flying monkey's face.</div></div><hr />

Screenie would be priceless, I would have to frame it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">wonder were you get the stones from...eww, nm, i don't want to know...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Azaza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Well, sure fire way to tag for faction, even though you gotta be in melee range anyway to use it, lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Acturian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">... our rogues were throwing stones at rallos zek ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">for when you run out of arrows of course.<br />
<br />
or for when you want to practice throwing skill.<br />
<br />
well it is a level one /disc after all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
in general all combat movement is generic, just because you see yourself use off hand dont mean you really do its just the animation of the combat for the most part.<br />
<br />
I found Stone Throw very usefull on a lvl 32 warrior alt I have helps with agro and cheaper than buying arrows, if I had room id still use it heck 2 damage isnt to far off from kick LOL.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">heh only used it on some alts never even thought to check what timer it was on!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Does it actually raise throwing skill?<br />
<br />
If so, i'll be using it. Last combat skill i havent maxxed yet...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">It's a discipline.  I very much doubt that it will raise any skills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Diminia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">What level do you get it, and where do you get it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Pag0</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Level 1, in the new Tutorial Zone, or you can buyit from the same npc you buy all current discs from.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Arathena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Throw stone is a direct damage 'spell' in addition to being a discipline. Like all direct damage spells, it will have a moderate chance to break any root. It's not guaranteed, but it can indeed work.<br />
<br />
And, uh, yeah. It's a level 1 melee skill. It's not really supposed to revolutionize the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So far its broke root every time I have tried it.  Bad thing is its on the same timer as provoke so I have to wait for that come up as I use provoke quite a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Diminia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Level 1, in the new Tutorial Zone, or you can buyit from the same npc you buy all current discs from.<br />
<br />
What new Tutorial Zone?  Where is that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Start a new character to see it. :)  Players can go up to level 5 in the tutorial, I believe.  It is very well done.<br />
<br />
It's basically a Rujark LDON themed map.  First it teaches you the absolute basics: targeting, movement, hailing, and attacking.  Then you get ported to a cave containing a bunch of NPCs, each of which teaches you about something: spells, disciplines, questing, tradeskills, grouping, swimming, etc.<br />
<br />
Among other things, everyone gets a free spell or throw stone disc (even hybrids get a wussy spell), one NPC improves your starting weapon when you hand it to him, and you also get a quest resulting in a charm with something like +10 hp/mana (which is HUGE at that level).<br />
<br />
When you head into the tunnels you find kobolds, spiders, rats, etc.  They start at level 1 but get higher as you go deeper.  Named kobolds can pop who are level 5 or so, and maybe drop loot (didn't kill any).  You can bring stuff back to the NPCs and get pieces of basic armor in return, or just sell it for plat.  Spellcasters can buy the rest of their level 1 spells within the tutorial, and there are the usual backpacks and stuff for sale too.<br />
<br />
You can group up with others who are in the tutorial.  I think there's some kind of LDON instancing going on, but you always seem to share the tutorial zone with a few other people at a time.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Dacke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I have the charm on this lvl 5 pally (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=544386) the charm i got from hailing people more or less :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Rayde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">This saved my life -3- times yesterday. Thanks Inferna!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Duchess Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Your welcome and some people say I don't contribute  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Vasto</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">As far as I've seen I can single pull effectively in some places if I run up quickly and 'Throw Stone' and run backwards out of agro range of the other mobs.. Maybe I'm just betting lucky, but it seems to have less agro range than an arrow or even bellow/incite.</div></div><hr />
