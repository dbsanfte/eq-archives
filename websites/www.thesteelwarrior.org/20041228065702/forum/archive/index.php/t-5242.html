<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">01-17-2004, 11:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">LOL without looking at the magelo, 65.<br />
<br />
AA are very fast then and you will tank better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">01-18-2004, 01:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">While I disagree that the &quot;get 65, forget AA until then&quot; mentality is best, you've got one set of defensive AA done and have over 6k unbuffed.  65 should be next, I agree.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">01-18-2004, 03:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am puzzled.  Your magelo shows you being 65, with ND3.  Not sure where the discrepency comes in(fake magelo posted, with all hp AA's?), but anyway...get 65, then get AE taunt, then finish ND3.  Oh, and sell the splitblade and get an agro weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zordian</div><div class="date">01-18-2004, 08:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry about the magelo.. I was trying to see how many HP I would have when 65 and full HP aa's.  Anyhow.. it is accurate now..  <br />
<br />
Regarding the Splitblade.. I had that for HP and AC.  Might you suggest a better 1 handed aggro weapon?  Please advise, as I am still having prolems with my Incite ability, and need all the aggro I can get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">01-18-2004, 09:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cheap but not pretty - a Greatstaff of thunder<br />
10k or a couple of hrs farming - put the scimitar offhand and use a Sword of the Bloodsworn or Copper Hammer of Striking mainhand<br />
Lots of Ebayed plat - Either Blade of Carnage or Scepter of Destruction main hand<br />
<br />
Personally I stayed level 60 till I had ND3 and then started levelling again, though I was at ND2 when PoP came out so it wasnt a long stop over.  At the time I was barely hitting 4khps though so I needed the HPs, you're in a lot better shape so I recommend 65 then AAs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You don't get a full suit of Ornate, Earth tradeskilled shit and other assorted raid loot without knowing that you need to get your ass to 65 to compete.<br />
<br />
Or you're ebayed, one of the 2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zordian</div><div class="date">01-19-2004, 11:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some how I knew that was coming..<br />
<br />
I was originally a 65 Wizard, Angil, in Fire and Fury, which was at the time approaching Time Access.  My work schedule became hectic and could no longer raid anymore.  So what I did, was stop playing.  Then ended up selling Angil's gear, creating a warrior instead, as I was getting bored with the wizard. <br />
<br />
Your right, it looked bad with out first explaining myself.  If you have any questiong about the accuracy, please feel free to send tellz to anyone in Fire and Fury or my current guild.  Angil was my first toon, so as you could guess, I knew how to play a wizard.. not a warrior, so I am still trying to learn how to play the class right, as to not make an ass of myself.  <br />
<br />
Please.. ask me though next time.. no need to flame as I have no history here to merit that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">01-19-2004, 12:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, but wtf dude, did you turn off guild chat the entire time you were with them?  You just mysteriously thought that because you needed to be 65 on your wizard it was cool to sit around at 63 and grind aa's and you'd be fine?  That's retarded, what kind of logic is that anyway?<br />
<br />
Ya, i've got a 65 XXXX, but now I'm playing XXXX, and I was wondering..should I still get to 65?<br />
<br />
The explanation is almost worse than when there was none.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zordian</div><div class="date">01-19-2004, 12:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fair enough.. <br />
<br />
however.. I read so many differant posts here and it is easy to lead in different directions.<br />
<br />
Same with guild chat.. Our warriors already had 65 with all defensive.. and as a wizard.. I had no need to ask them how they did it at the time, as I was playing the wizard.<br />
<br />
While your point was valid I guess, it still sucks to get flamed when I was simply asking for help.</div></div><hr />

For someone with obvious elemental access, it should be fairly clear what the end goal is.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, your magelo just &quot;happens&quot; to be incorrect and says you are 65 with all HP AA's when you start here, and only after someone points it out do you modify it down to a level where you could ask the question.<br />
<br />
All in all tho, you handled the situation pretty well, I've gotta give you credit for that.   So I guess you're not a troll, just proof that you don't have to know what you're doing to be at the end game of EQ.</div></div><hr />

  <br />
<br />
Actually when he first posted the question the magelo was correct, not the level 65 version. I assume it's like he said, he wanted to check and see what 65 and those AA's would do for him and forgot to change it back.</div></div><hr />

I also have a Wizard as my main but I Just wanted to try a Melee class and, I love it. For you Haass, You assume that as a wizard I am &quot;watching&quot; everything in GC that concerns warriors? Well Guess what, not all of us can predict the future like you obviously can and know that &quot;Yea cool i will be starting a Warrior in 8 months.. Better start watching what the Warriors are doing/asking in GC so I can learn how to play the class better&quot;.  Wake up dude!<br />
<br />
You strike me as a judgemental &quot;Know it all&quot; that should just maybe once in a while help someone and realize not &quot;All&quot; of us know everything there is to know about every class instead of &quot;assuming&quot; things. It's people like you that make boards like this rather unpleasant at times. <br />
<br />
I am not one to point out something negative without offering a possible solution: <br />
<br />
Possible Solution: Take a valium and maybe replace the flames with some valuable input.</div></div><hr />

Sorry I hurt your feelings, but if you're not intelligent enough to realize that level 65 is important when everyone else in your guild is level 65, then you deserve what you get.  It's not a matter of paying attention, this is a matter of getting to level 65, knowing what it means, and then applying that logic in the future.  You got to 65 on your wizard?  Great.  Now what makes you think that you should keep your warrior at level XX, where XX is not 65.  It's ridiculous.  The very notion of it defies logical thinking, and if you're getting pissed off because i have a problem with illogical thinking, well then you're right.  Think about things for 5 seconds and we wouldn't need these &quot;65 or AA&quot; threads every week.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drunder50</div><div class="date">01-22-2004, 11:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Haass,<br />
<br />
I never said getting to 65 was not important. Zordian merely asked for advice on whether to continue on to 65 or finish some aa's.  I guess what you are saying is just screw aa's and get to 65 asap. Well thats YOUR thinking but guess what, Not everyone thinks like YOU! leveling to 65 or stopping for a bit to get aa's is a PERSONAL decision. I truely believe everyone wants to get to 65 (Obviously) but  Just because it goes against your &quot;Belief&quot; doesn't mean you should just blast away at someone.  Some guilds require some aa's but not all require lvl 65 as you will get there soon enough. My guild never complained when I stopped leveling at 62 to get some crit aa's and such. Dont you think extra added Crits on occasion would be a good thing? Of course not Why? because I wasn't 65 at that time, right?, right?<br />
<br />
Why dont you ask some questions first before laying into someone? When Z replied to your flame he clearly stated his situation and he only did so (I believe) because you attacked him.   <br />
<br />
You appear to be a rude, judgemental person.. admit it and learn from it and maybe try being a bit nicer to people instead of flying off the handle and creating hate and discontent.<br />
<br />
Im done with this post.. lets move on..</div></div><hr />
