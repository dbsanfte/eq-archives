<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Varaho</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">'Cause the thread about flags is going to turn into a flame filled bitch-fest.<br />
<br />
Further Down the Line<br />
 <br />
<br />
In the next month or so we will be implementing some changes designed to bring more fun back into the game.  Our experience with Planes of Power has taught us a lot about what we did right and what we should avoid in the future.  Building an online game like EverQuest offers us the unique opportunity to see how customers react to our ideas and to adjust them if needed.  We'll be taking the opportunity to put some of our experience to work to improve the play experience in EverQuest.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
1)      Partial Zone Revamps.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
These consist of improvements in the experience gain, monster density and/or item rewards in some of the older zones.  The goal is to improve the playability and reward for adventuring in these zones without completely remaking the contents of the zone.  We plan to do several of these, and we'll keep you updated as we move through these.  Currently we are working on a partial revamp of Veeshan's Peak.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
2)      Experience Range Adjustment.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
When Planes of Power was released and the level cap was raised from 60 to 65, the range of NPCs that characters in the new levels could kill to gain experience was smaller than it is for characters of lower levels.  This was done to encourage characters to fight more challenging enemies and allowed us to increase the experience reward given for that increased challenge.  Unfortunately, this has limited the locations available to 61+ level characters for experience gain, as well as making it more difficult for solo players to gain experience.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
This is something that we don't like, and it has had a negative affect on the &quot;fun factor&quot; involved in playing in Planes of Power.  To correct this, we will be increasing the level range of NPCs that will give 61+ level characters experience.  They will have approximately the same range of NPCs available to them as they did at level 60, and should be able to gain experience in some of their old hunting grounds, as well as in Planes of Power zones.<br />
<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
4)      Items in the Planes of Power<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
We will be looking at the quality of Planes of Power item rewards and improving them where appropriate.  Items for many of the lower tier gods will be upgraded and more rare items and NPCs will be added to the following zones as needed:<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Crypt of Decay<br />
<br />
Plane of Torment<br />
<br />
Halls of Honor<br />
<br />
Plane of Tactics<br />
<br />
Plane of Innovation<br />
<br />
Bastion of Thunder<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
5)      Class Balance<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
We are going to look at improving the damage capabilities of melee classes, as they've fallen behind their magic-using counterparts at the very high end of the game.  Some options being considered are:<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Improve melee damage-increasing disciplines <br />
<br />
Improve Planes of Power melee weapons <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Additionally, we're looking at the concerns from players about their spells, and changing them where appropriate.  The goal here is to remove annoying issues with spells, not necessarily to increase caster power overall.<br />
<br />
<br />
1 &amp; 2: would be &quot;a good thing&quot; by adding more zones to exp in rather than cramming everyone into PoP.  <br />
<br />
4: would mean seeing something other than parchment drops and the rare cash loot in an exp group one would nope. <br />
<br />
5: messing with discs is kinda strange, maybe if they put them all on their own timer and/or shortened their reuse so they would get used more it would be nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">warriors are the rule of thumb and we are the hardest to change because everyone has to mesure up so the wording = very posistive melee change melee meaning warriors! just wish the scale wouldnt be gear&gt;player and more like gear=player.....<br />
 this should be a fun filled patch</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aveen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Don't hold your breath Gerick. Melee mean monks and rogues are gonna do more damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Would melee also mean hybrid classes as well?  Or do you think this is just oriented at pure melee?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>TaiilChayser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Usually when SoE refers to class balance the term &quot;melee&quot; refers to the pure melee classes i.e. Monks, Rogues, Warriors.. prolly in that order.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">ya, pallys sk and rangers are called hybrid but with this extended mana pool im sure they will have their hand out</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Since monks have been addressed a whole LOT in recent patchings ... look it for more to go along the lines of Rogue, Warrior, Monk type of order.<br />
<br />
Except on itemization, where monks will get a whole truckload of new weapons (well monks and beastlords), that all do about the same amount of damage that monks already had access to (like a 14/28 h2h weapon dropping somewhere in, say a revamped Sol B, or a 10/21 1hb dropping somwhere else).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Crist0</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">My opinion is they will be tweaking rogues a good bit, monks a little, and warriors not at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">REVAMP MISTMOORE KTHX  :D<br />
<br />
man that would rawk</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Splaktar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">They need to fix the classes, not just try to fix them by LOOT, AGAIN.  It's been repeately proven that fixing them by loot does not work in the long run.  Maybe they aren't thinking long run anymore tho...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">'Pure Melee' would be the correct term for Monks, rogues, Warriors. 'Melee' as used here I would expect to affect every class that deals it's primary damage via hand weapons. Casters are well overpowered compared with melee at this time thus melee damage may get a boost but i'm doubtful that the issues as we percieve them will get much attention - probably another itemisation cop out at best. New discs on the same timer as defensive (unless a VERY low reuse time) will see virtually no use unless the raid has so many warriors that some players are feeling totally redundant. Exp groups.. forget it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">mistmoore. all level 55. think about the AA exp..... same stats/hp/hitting mobs only upgraded to low 50's</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Draxus Diablus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Did they decide to can the flag removal thing, or is it still being planned?</div></div><hr />
