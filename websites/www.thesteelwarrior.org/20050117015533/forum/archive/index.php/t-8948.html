<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Conanix</div><div class="date">09-15-2004, 08:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey all was just wondering if you could give me a update on how I am doing gear and AA wise. We are on the verg of breaking into VT. Just waiting on those people to get shards. Its getting to the point where killing emp is boring for me. Altho our clerics feked up lastnight and we wiped on Emp.  3/6+ isnt bad I would say tho.<br />
Wiped first 2 times and then downed him like 6 times and now we wipe again.......... grrr.<br />
   But like I was saying any pointers on what I should look for in VT or even in bazaar or LDON's. I am the MT for my guild. (knolage is greater than HP at times) The ST/RT is a troll with about 2-300 more HP than me.<br />
Any advise is most welcome. Please be brutaly honest.<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">09-15-2004, 08:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You're fine. Just grab all the upgrades you can in VT like Aten's mask, gloves, bp :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frostpaw</div><div class="date">09-15-2004, 10:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gear looks nice.  Would save any guild DKP or merit for one or two really nice items out of VT rather than burn em up on numerous smaller upgrades. The things I would look at replacing first are that 5ac bracer, neck, and mask. <br />
<br />
For the bracer, a LDoN bracer or Mana-Threaded would be nearly as good as Umbracite and leave you your DKP/merit for Aten loot like the Mask. Also, sounds like you working Emp over without problems. See if you can get guild to add Inny to your raid list. He drops a bracer that would be nice upgrade.<br />
<br />
For the neck you could consider doing the VP quest neck...again, saving dkp for a big purchase off Aten like the BP/mask/gloves.<br />
<br />
For mask Crimson Runed all the way if you get a chance at it. Would be bigger upgrade for you than BP.<br />
<br />
Not sure how often you do LDoN, but looks like could use some agro augs, and hp/ac augs when ya get the points for em. Anger aug for mainhand at least should be a priority.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Conanix</div><div class="date">09-16-2004, 04:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dont really belive in auging wepons that alredy proc hate. I have in my bag a sword from BoT great blade of storms I think. It has an anger 3 aug on it. I feel that after i auged it that i proc alot less with the nuke now. So I think it will lower the proc rate of the already nice Bloodfrenzy. Plus like you said I would rather spend my points on the HP.<br />
Thanks you  guys. Its nice to hear that im doing fair.  <br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">09-16-2004, 04:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No.Anger 3 auging your Bloodfrenzy is a huge aggro upgrade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bustauff</div><div class="date">09-16-2004, 07:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Your AC/HP are great, I had less than you when I first started in VT. For loot, try to get a Cloudy mark for your wrist and then the Visor from AHR, after that get whatever you think is an upgrade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crimsonbanshee</div><div class="date">09-16-2004, 07:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not auging the  BF  would be a mistake in  my eyes rest looks alright  for where you are in the game</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nilana</div><div class="date">09-16-2004, 08:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">BF auged is insane.  I currently use BF/BOC combo both auged with Anger 3 w/ wa5.  I can honestly say my combo procs a lot more then it did prior to the augs.<br />
<br />
You may also want to keep your eyes out for the Torque of the Wyrmlord from Emp.  IMO it was a very well spent upgrade.  If nothing else i can imagine being able to use the 300hp buff for a very long time :)  I am using it as a neckslot currently if you want to see the stats.  It seems to be a very rare drop though.   <br />
<br />
Also I have quite a few VT items if you want to take a look at some of them<br />
<br />
Best of luck with your gear, you seem to be doing very well already though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
you should just....camp and delete omg. &quot;Feel&quot; isn't scientific enough in EQ, you need to back it up with parses :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh that opinion will change as you progress past VT into PoP and God I assure you...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Conanix</div><div class="date">09-16-2004, 06:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow and here I thought I was behind the curv. I am glad that is not so. Yes I will aug the BF after reading your post's and some past post's. I will have to make shure auging the BoC is ok with guildleader since it belongs to the guild. I am shure he wont mind since we are such good friends. Ya my next item as for raiding will be the neck from emp or the mask in VT. Unless the BP drops first.  That wont be for a while tho since we have not even raided VT yet really.<br />
  I thank you all for your advice. I was wondering  &quot;IMO&quot; on what AA's to get. I was thinking on finishing stalwart endurance(SP) then working on lvl 66+ for OOW xpac when im able to get it that is. Or is there other AA's I should worry about first?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FurryCrew</div><div class="date">09-16-2004, 07:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you get Lucky with a Hategiver or a BBotE you'll prob be safe to offload the BoC to the next tank down....if you don't mind losing some stats<br />
<br />
Ohh if you're getting into VT Vallon Zek should be doable and his Scimitar is very decent agro (has proc mod) and nice stats (not to mention the graphic kicks ass IMHO)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Conanix</div><div class="date">09-17-2004, 05:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Scimitar is very decent <br />
Ya I have one of those already. I used it before i got BoC and the BF. Used to use scimitar and great blade of storms with anger3 aug. Then i put on the BoC and used gbos. Now I use bf+BoC</div></div><hr />
