<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>McAle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i think it possible to scrounge up maybe 10k with some work on my monk, im looking to up HP/AC and deffinatly a much better 2ndary, but not looking to blow it all on 1 item.  My guild regulary raids Kael, and Occasionally ToV hot but because of my lvl im not permitted to roll on any drops.<br />
<br />
Opinions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>McAle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">anyone?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zendien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hmm, grab some more Helanic Tundra armor maybe. Or just go hunt in spots with better drops (browse the web for info), and get some more levels while there :D<br />
<br />
As for a good offhander: No clue :P<br />
<br />
Hopefully some other warriors will help you out a bit more, lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gaspie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Helanic Tundra, another Valorium Ring, and kinda expensive but Diseased Skullcase is nice (see my magelo). I'd suggest getting a CHoS or SotB, whichever you can afford but you need to be 50 for hammer to proc. Oh, once you get 51 and if you have the cash get a Heavy Rubicite Girdle. If you can't do that then level and get SS gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The Helanic cultural is a good direction for you lotsa hp and stam.Find a smith and start farming /saving for deals and hope for good luck or buy made pieces.I farmed and dredged up the bits for my rz armor when Stromm was new.Was a good way to go for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I agree with the cultural armor idea, and particularly with Gunnar's version. Check to see if there are any smiths in your guild who can make the tribunal you need.<br />
If 10K is your budget, though, I'd first check server prices on the Copper hammer of striking and save out enough to buy that.<br />
Also, you say you raid Kael a lot but can't bid on drops? Nor even the corroded drops for Champion's armor quest out of Thurgadin? Because if those drops are not included in the bid ban, then I'd look into the quest. I wouldn't advise people to go hunting in Kael for those drops, but hey, if you're there already....I think BP, legs, helm, gloves and boots would be upgrades for you.<br />
Also, there's LDoN on non-raid days. Points may come too slowly to be a quick fix, but start banking them now.<br />
And, do you have haste and I missed it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Frostpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Helanic Tundra is really nice armor and I would recommend getting pieces of it made as you are able to afford them. A lot of those pieces you wont even replace with ornate, so you will get extensive use out of them. <br />
<br />
Also, be good to know what level you need to be to start bidding on raid drops. If your guild doing Kael a lot then a BP, helm, boots, gaunts, ring, bow, and even a BoC are all possibilities that you will get for free. That would help you decide which slots to fill with Helanic Tundra first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>McAle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I am able to bid on Kael drops(our guild really doesnt have firepower to do AoW anyway), its just ToV drops i cant bid on</div></div><hr />
