<br />
Quest starts in Dranik Scar...find (Ogre) Korbuk Brimblade, he is located close to ZI at /loc -1048.76, -1359.82, 243.62 <br />
<br />
You say, 'Hail, Korbuk Brimblade' <br />
<br />
Korbuk Brimblade says 'Well now, aren't you a meager one? Da name is Korbuk Brimblade. Have you felt anything strange lately?' <br />
<br />
You say, 'I feel strange' <br />
<br />
Korbuk Brimblade says 'Aha, you have sensed it as well. For a while, I believed it was just me dat noticed it. Now dat you've confirmed my suspicions, I'm sure I can move forward with my [work].' <br />
<br />
You say, 'I will work' <br />
<br />
Korbuk Brimblade says 'Yeah, ok. You look like da respectable type. I wish it was an easy story to tell, but me thinks it's not so easy. I'm uncertain if you know da story of da red scabbard. I was named after my ancestor by da same name. In a great war, Rallos Zek bestowed to my ancestor da fabled red scabbard after Suteng was slain. It had been his charge and dat of my family to hold da scabbard until a [true warrior] would step forward to claim it as theirs once more.' <br />
<br />
You say, 'I am a true warrior' <br />
<br />
Korbuk Brimblade says 'Time passed and no warrior came forth. Then da terrible scourge took hold of da ogres and we began to lose ourselves. It was then dat another ancestor of mine, Grivnok Brimblade, asked a human to take charge of da scabbard until da scourge had waned. He would know dat time when a descendant of Korbuk with da same name would come forth. It was then dat da Redblade family, led by Thegrek, took over da charge of da scabbard until I would return to [reclaim da charge] in da name of da Brimblade family.' <br />
<br />
You say, 'I will reclaim the charge' <br />
<br />
Korbuk Brimblade says 'It was I who returned to da Redblades, who spoke with da descendant of Thegrek. But I could not reclaim da charge. I felt a greater power, something more amazing and powerful than even da red scabbard contained. What draw I felt from da scabbard I felt ten fold from this [new source], and I was unable to explain where it was coming from. I just know dat it has drawn me here, to this place, so that I might find da answers I seek here.' <br />
<br />
You say, 'what new source' <br />
<br />
Korbuk Brimblade says 'I can't express who or what it is dat is drawing me here. I only know dat this is where I must be. I feel as though this is something like da scabbard, but more powerful. Perhaps it is a new weapon? If so, I must be da one to lead da charge to protect its power until da right warrior comes along to claim it. Just as my family led da charge so long ago to protect da red scabbard, so shall I continue it with this new journey. Are you [willing to help] knowing all dat?' <br />
<br />
You say, 'I am willing to help' <br />
<br />
Korbuk Brimblade says 'I had hoped so. Let's get started then. It seems the powerful lure is greatest when I am at this point, so I must remain here to ensure dat I can keep a grasp on where it resides. I'm hoping dat after you return with whatever you can find, I'll be able to uncover more information. From time to time, I get flashes of da things dat we need to find, like da picture of a place or a [thing]...'' <br />
<br />
You say, 'what thing' <br />
<br />
Korbuk Brimblade says 'Just now I had a flash of a book, or pages of a book. Just as quickly as the book was there, it split into da cover and three pages and then fell to da ground. I wonder if dat's going to happen often... In any case, maybe you should have a look around to see if you can find any pages from a book that are on da ground. Return to me if you find them.' <br />
<br />
There is a cover and 3 pages to turn in. And I guess they dont drop often? <br />
<br />
With that said I searched high and low for 2 hours today, didnt find anything so far, ill keep searching. Help me out guys! Lets get epified!</div></div><hr />
