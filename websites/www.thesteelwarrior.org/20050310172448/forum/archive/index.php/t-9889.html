<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frodlin7th</div><div class="date">11-30-2004, 02:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Need some input on the &quot;Top 10&quot; list.   This is the current list.  Please use this thread (or the one on EQ Live) to recommend any changes.  <br />
<br />
I would like to have it submitted by Thursday, so hop to it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This is the current Top 10 list, please give a yea or nay and/or any suggestions for changes by Thursday.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
1.      Taunt.   Success rate, particularly the steep decline vs. Yellow/Red mobs, is too low and too unreliable (currently being evaluated)<br />
<br />
2.      Re-Evaluate Epic 1.5/2.0 Effect  (Epics for all classes are currently being re-evaluated)<br />
<br />
Details:   Effect has 3 major issues:   <br />
<br />
a. Duration of 60 seconds:  Please change to 'until rune aspect is used'<br />
<br />
b. Cast time: Please change to instant<br />
<br />
c. Currently severaly underpowered in relation to Paladin epic click<br />
<br />
3.     Endurance Regen:   We need endurance regen from Spells and/or items.   Modrods should provide an endurance benefit equal to the mana benefit.  Also, change + Endurance only augments to +Endurance regen.   (currently being evaluated)<br />
<br />
4.   Re-Evaluate warrior disciplines.   (currently being evaluated)<br />
There's a few issues:   <br />
<br />
A. Endurance costs on all of the new discs is WAY too high<br />
<br />
B. Aura of Runes negates the use of inherent proc right clicks.   Please consider &quot;suspending&quot; them rather than dispelling them completely.<br />
<br />
C. The level 70 discipline needs to be effective against even con and higher mobs.   If it's not reasonable to make level 70+ mobs stunnable (and it's probably not reasonable), then change the effect to a dramatic defensive based damage shield (DD) effect, or a &quot;defensive&quot; hate inducing proc, or something along those lines.   As it currently stands, there's not a whole lot of use for the discipline which SHOULD be our best.   <br />
<br />
D. Savage onslaught needs a longer timer or shorter refresh and a MUCH lower endurance upkeep.<br />
<br />
 <br />
5.   Range attack while pulling (currently being evaluated)<br />
Note: The proliferation of ranged items which eliminate the use of a bow or thrown item without awkward item swapping, it is requested that the 'Throw Stone&quot; skill be unlinked from the incite line, and a longer range placed on it (100ish feet)<br />
 <br />
 <br />
6.      Add a shield disc or shield usefulness (no change planned at this time) <br />
The following are helpful suggestions as to what can be adjusted to shields to make them something desired.   Above all, when it comes to shields, we want the option to use them for a noticeable benefit.  <br />
 <br />
Adjust the effect of Furious Bash, to make it either a standard proc, or a percentage hate modifier.   The concept isn't to make shields as good at aggro as dual wielding or using a 2 hand weapon, but to make them a viable option with some tangible benefit.<br />
 <br />
Add Shielding or block to shields<br />
 <br />
Warrior shields result in a larger DPS decrease than knight shields do based on the nature of knight weapons vs. warrior weapons.    A warrior equipped shield should add a +damage modifier to his/her main hand weapon so that when using a shield, the DPS balance continues to exist.<br />
 <br />
Shields equippable by tanks should exceed dramatically the stats gained with an offhand weapon.   30AC and 50hp arent' enough benefit to the loss of aggro and damage that occurs when a shield is equipped<br />
 <br />
UPDATE:  The real issues at this time is aggro generation comparatively with other classes who have this AA ability, who have taken dramatic strides toward tanking parity with us due to Omens launch and content,  we take a much larger hit in aggro generation than others, as well as the availability of good main hand only weapons to make the shield AA useful  for those without BBoB/Darkblade/Fleshbiter<br />
 <br />
7.      Improve stun from kick/slam (currently being evaluated)<br />
 <br />
 <br />
8.     Melee Focus Effects:   The current level of melee foci are too limited.   There are no mage summonned melee foci, and melee foci were not retroactively placed on older gear.   The current list of foci is also too limited in what it acheives when compared with caster foci.   (currently being evaluated)<br />
 <br />
9.    Please re-evaluate endurance costs on Omens Disciplines/End skills. (currently being evaluated)<br />
 <br />
Note:  the cost/benefit ratio of omens discs and skills are fairly extreme, and endurance depletion is occurring, with endurance regen being nil, and in some cases below what it was in Gates, this is an issue. <br />
 <br />
10.  Increase the pushback on &quot;Press the Attack&quot; and the chance to interrupt on it. (currently being evaluated)</div></div><hr />

        c. ney , please keep any class comparition out of this list, has much, you could say its underpowered in relation to other epics.<br />
<br />
3.   big yea<br />
<br />
4.   yea <br />
     A. actually if point 3 is done and end regen appear then this point could be negleted<br />
     B. no oppinion on this one<br />
     C. big yea<br />
     D. Again if point 3 is done no need to mention endurance here, and one thing Savage onslaught needs is a higher proc rate.<br />
<br />
5.   yea<br />
 <br />
6.   couldnt care less, dont plan to use a shield.<br />
 <br />
7.   not overly important<br />
 <br />
8.   yea<br />
 <br />
9.   And once again focus on point 3 and get us endurance regen ways.<br />
 <br />
10.  big yea</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baadan</div><div class="date">11-30-2004, 02:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd definitely like to see some retrofitting for melee foci done. It really isn't fair that junk from classic EQ has focus effects that really help low level casters but nothing has changed for us. It'd also be nice if some staple Melee items like Crustacean, old school quest armor (but I don't know if caster stuff got focuses and it wouldn't be fair if they didnt), FBSS, Frosty, etc.<br />
<br />
It'd be nice if the Invigor line of spells was changed back to increasing your Endurance so they'd have a real use. I mean, for years they were almost useless then there was a chance they might have some real importance in a spell lineup but that was removed so now they're even more useless than before. Also, we really need some kind of FT equivalent for our Endurance that is equally attainable as FT items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pag0</div><div class="date">11-30-2004, 03:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1. Taunt. Success rate, particularly the steep decline vs. Yellow/Red mobs, is too low and too unreliable (currently being evaluated)<br />
Yes, Keep please. Perhaps it could even be an aa (would need to be fairly inexpensive to be reasonable)<br />
<br />
2. Re-Evaluate Epic 1.5/2.0 Effect (Epics for all classes are currently being re-evaluated)<br />
Yes, Keep<br />
Details: Effect has 3 major issues:<br />
<br />

<br />
4. Re-Evaluate warrior disciplines. (currently being evaluated)<br />
There's a few issues:<br />
Yes, Keep please. Combine 9 into this one since they are basicly the same issue<br />
<br />
A. Endurance costs on all of the new discs is WAY too high<br />
<br />
B. Aura of Runes negates the use of inherent proc right clicks. Please consider &quot;suspending&quot; them rather than dispelling them completely.<br />
<br />

Yes, Keep please. Another option could even be to reevaluate Press the Attack to have a long range again. Could combine issue 10 into this one, or keep them separate. <br />
<br />
6. Add a shield disc or shield usefulness (no change planned at this time)<br />
The following are helpful suggestions as to what can be adjusted to shields to make them something desired. Above all, when it comes to shields, we want the option to use them for a noticeable benefit.<br />
Yes, Keep please. I know it's just optimistic to keep it when they say no change, but I'm an optimist. Sometimes.<br />
<br />
Adjust the effect of Furious Bash, to make it either a standard proc, or a percentage hate modifier. The concept isn't to make shields as good at aggro as dual wielding or using a 2 hand weapon, but to make them a viable option with some tangible benefit.<br />
<br />
Add Shielding or block to shields<br />
<br />

8. Melee Focus Effects: The current level of melee foci are too limited. There are no mage summonned melee foci, and melee foci were not retroactively placed on older gear. The current list of foci is also too limited in what it acheives when compared with caster foci. (currently being evaluated)<br />
Yes, Keep. Would be nice if they would add a variety of melee focus items (increase dmg modifier, increase hate, perhaps a hate decreaser?, etc) Mage summoned would not be quite as useful at the higher levels but would provide a nice option. I still wish they would expand somewhat on the Echo of Anger line.<br />
<br />
9. Please re-evaluate endurance costs on Omens Disciplines/End skills. (currently being evaluated)<br />
No, this really is already discussed under 4. <br />
Note: the cost/benefit ratio of omens discs and skills are fairly extreme, and endurance depletion is occurring, with endurance regen being nil, and in some cases below what it was in Gates, this is an issue.<br />
<br />
10. Increase the pushback on &quot;Press the Attack&quot; and the chance to interrupt on it. (currently being evaluated)<br />
Yes, Keep please. Although,this could be incorporated into the Throw Stone line as discussed in number 5<br />
<br />
<br />

9 and 10 could both be removed/combined with the previous requests. Not sure atm what I would like to see them replaced with.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bardeil</div><div class="date">11-30-2004, 04:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1. Taunt. <br />
Yea.<br />
<br />
2. Re-Evaluate Epic 1.5/2.0 Effect <br />
a. Duration of 60 seconds: Please change to 'until rune aspect is used'<br />
Yea<br />
<br />
<br />
Or preferably make it 60 seconds with no cap (would be more equivalent to paladin effect this way)<br />
<br />
b. Cast time: Please change to instant<br />
Yea <br />
<br />
<br />
Not THAT big a deal imo, I can spam it and get if off while getting an assbeating from reparm pretty easily. It's real utilitty is when your group is getting the crap beat out of them by a train or whatever though, and I doubt i'd get one off with lots of mobs on me.<br />
<br />
<br />
c. Currently severely underpowered in relation to Paladin epic click<br />
Yea. <br />
<br />
<br />
I forget to click it, and seldom do I care. The paladin click doesn't have a maximum amount of healing gained like our 'rune' does, does it?<br />
<br />
The two buff slots is more than I can afford 99% of the time, too. Can't they at least make the self only portion be a single icon instead of 2?<br />
<br />
Additionally... Our epic focus is utterly worthless... I would find a weight reduction (PACKRAT!) focus more useful than taking 2 seconds off the incite timer. Additional innate hate, reduced incite cost, or increased incite effectiveness would be very welcome and appropriate imo.<br />
<br />
<br />
3. Endurance Regen.<br />
Yea<br />
<br />
4. Re-Evaluate warrior disciplines.<br />
A. Endurance costs on all of the new discs is WAY too high<br />
Yea<br />
<br />
B. Aura of Runes negates the use of inherent proc right clicks. Please consider &quot;suspending&quot; them rather than dispelling them completely.<br />
Yea<br />
<br />
C. The level 70 discipline needs to be effective against even con and higher mobs. <br />
Yea<br />
<br />
D. Savage onslaught needs a longer timer or shorter refresh and a MUCH lower endurance upkeep.<br />
Yea<br />
<br />
<br />
In general, our new discs are worthless. Even bazu bellow is only marginally useful since it runs me out of endurance in any group that pulls and kills fast enough I'd actually need it. I can MA for EP trash clearing for less than 10 minutes, and i'm flat out of endurance and unable to use defensive for bosses. And it's not as if using bazu bellow gives me aggro lock anything like a pally either.<br />
<br />
<br />
5. Range attack while pulling (currently being evaluated)<br />
Yea. <br />
<br />
<br />
I'm not so opposed to carrying swapping in a bow when I need one, but the bags and bags of arrows and reagents gets really old. Would it really be so unreasonable for us to have some sort of gimpy endless quiver ability? /e bends over and picks up a stick for his bow. <br />
<br />
Maybe warriors could get some sort of slingshot AA or item that goes in the ammo slot and shoots unlimited 200 range 1 damage magic pebbles.<br />
<br />
Unlinked throw stone would be useful in some cases, but 100 range and 1 cast only would be somewhat limiting. Sometimes I need to tag with several arrows to get aggro off an incoming mob.<br />
<br />
<br />
6. Add a shield disc or shield usefulness (no change planned at this time)<br />
Indifferent<br />
<br />
<br />
I'd rather have them swap our shield block aa for some sort of warrior unique advanced offhand parry. Or maybe they could just make shield block work for offhand weapons? Epic 1.5 and 2.0 are swingable shields statswise, anyway.<br />
<br />
I don't see warriors using shields in EQ1 anytime soon unless they prove willing to make radical changes to the way they work, such as radically improving bash stuns when a shield is equipped or something.<br />
<br />
I don't really see anything happening here thuogh.<br />
<br />
<br />
7. Improve stun from kick/slam (currently being evaluated)<br />
Indifferent<br />
<br />
<br />
Seems to work pretty good to me, although I can never tell if it was me or someone else that triggered the interrupt. Probably just my ui setup though. I see the mob starting to cast 'gate' and I spam kick, and he gets interrupted pretty frequently. I tell myself kick is doing it. I should get lots of aggro for a kick stun too, and I bet I don't. hmm.<br />
<br />
<br />
8. Melee Focus Effects: <br />
Indifferent<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what this means. I don't see casters using mage summoned foci much, but I've gotta figure that radically improved ratios we're seeing on weapons makes up for some of the lack of focii.<br />
<br />
<br />
9. Please re-evaluate endurance costs on Omens Disciplines/End skills. (currently being evaluated)<br />
Nay. Isn't this the same as 4?<br />
<br />
10. Increase the pushback on &quot;Press the Attack&quot; and the chance to interrupt on it. (currently being evaluated)<br />
Yea<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't have the aa yet, but I haven't been impressed with what it's been doing for others. It should be a darn near guaranteed spell interupt at the minimum IMO.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway just my 2cp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cloudwalker21</div><div class="date">11-30-2004, 05:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think its a good list, my only comment is an addition to the Savage Onslaught clause.  Give an increased chance to land a critical hit while under the effects of it, otherwise it is worthless to people who do not have all their critical hit aa done (and even then its still not worth the endurance it uses) and may or may not be using a 2 hander.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frodlin7th</div><div class="date">11-30-2004, 05:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, do me a favor...<br />
<br />
When you see something that you feel is duplicated (such as subclause in 4 and #9), please provide an alternative to replace one of the merged issues with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vamcoy</div><div class="date">11-30-2004, 08:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Frod i know this isnt the place but Im gonna put it out there anyway. Actually it might go under the endurance regen aspect for the epic focus instead of decreasing the time for incite how about lowering incite/bellow endurance cost?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frodlin7th</div><div class="date">11-30-2004, 10:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nah, this is a good place for that</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Argin</div><div class="date">12-01-2004, 01:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'll agree on not really caring about shields, or ways to make them more useful.  To overcome the downsides (less swings, less agro, less dps, etc) you'd have to give shields a pretty hefty bonus in some other area, and I don't think throwing in better defensive capabilities on top of what is available would do a whole lot for the already precarious balance of tanking abilities.  <br />
<br />
I guess as something to replace that, not that it's a big deal, but I never understood why knights get 2 hand bash and warriors don't; it just doesn't make a lot of sense that some classes who have the ability to use shields get to use bash without one, but another class with supposed better mastery of weapons and armor isn't able to.  But, again, this is hardly a top ten issue i think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">12-01-2004, 04:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1. Taunt. Success rate, particularly the steep decline vs. Yellow/Red mobs, is too low and too unreliable (currently being evaluated)<br />
oh yeah ! hurry up on this one<br />
<br />
2. Re-Evaluate Epic 1.5/2.0 Effect (Epics for all classes are currently being re-evaluated)<br />
Details: Effect has 3 major issues: <br />
a. Duration of 60 seconds: Please change to 'until rune aspect is used'<br />
of course<br />
b. Cast time: Please change to instant<br />
of course<br />
c. Currently severaly underpowered in relation to Paladin epic click<br />
of course<br />
<br />
d. our epic is meant to be an offhand weapon. thus it cross the shield issue (#6)<br />
<br />
<br />
3. Endurance Regen: We need endurance regen from Spells and/or items. Modrods should provide an endurance benefit equal to the mana benefit. Also, change + Endurance only augments to +Endurance regen. (currently being evaluated)<br />
yeah. However I am afraid we get an END nerf and an end regen ala FT. This would be really bad, it would force us to sacrifice other primary stat for end regen (like casters).<br />
<br />
4. Re-Evaluate warrior disciplines. (currently being evaluated)<br />
There's a few issues: <br />
A. Endurance costs on all of the new discs is WAY too high<br />
of course<br />
<br />
B. Aura of Runes negates the use of inherent proc right clicks. Please consider &quot;suspending&quot; them rather than dispelling them completely.<br />
of course<br />
<br />
C. The level 70 discipline needs to be effective against even con and higher mobs. If it's not reasonable to make level 70+ mobs stunnable (and it's probably not reasonable), then change the effect to a dramatic defensive based damage shield (DD) effect, or a &quot;defensive&quot; hate inducing proc, or something along those lines. As it currently stands, there's not a whole lot of use for the discipline which SHOULD be our best. <br />
what about an AoE hate generator : every mob within our taunt radius get a &quot;FT-like hate&quot;. I mean, the hate of every mob mob (within the range) toward us increase over time (quantity has to be evaluated) even if we do nothing at all to them (stunned, purpled, swinging at someone else, ...). <br />
<br />
D. Savage onslaught needs a longer timer or shorter refresh and a MUCH lower endurance upkeep.<br />
neah, it need to proc at least 10x more times.<br />
<br />
5. Range attack while pulling (currently being evaluated)<br />
adding a new disc line based on &quot;throw stone&quot; at each new step we would either have a longer ranger or a bigger domage or a shorter recast. we could end up with a 3domages/300range/3sec ... <br />
<br />
6. Add a shield disc or shield usefulness (no change planned at this time) <br />
we want shield usefullness because there is some nice avaible shield but we are wrong. since our epic is meant to be offhanded, we mustn't ask for shield but for increased DW :<br />
 * replace our OoW-shields AA with advanced DW AA <br />
 * add AA/disc that gives same skills to offhand than primary (with a reduced %) :  parry, ripost (and double ripost), tertiary swing, flurry, ... <br />
<br />
7. Improve stun from kick/slam (currently being evaluated)<br />
why not. we need ten lines in our top ten.<br />
<br />
8. Melee Focus Effects: The current level of melee foci are too limited. There are no mage summonned melee foci, and melee foci were not retroactively placed on older gear. The current list of foci is also too limited in what it acheives when compared with caster foci. (currently being evaluated)<br />
yeah<br />
<br />
9. Please re-evaluate endurance costs on Omens Disciplines/End skills. (currently being evaluated)<br />
same as previously said. but well we need ten lines and this one is really important so why not repeating it two or three times to be listen.<br />
<br />
10. Increase the pushback on &quot;Press the Attack&quot; and the chance to interrupt on it. (currently being evaluated)<br />
why not. I don't really care.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">12-01-2004, 09:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">4D - Savage Onslaught<br />
<br />
a. It's not totally clear to me that Cleave is increasing crit rates much. This sounds a whole lot like Paladin concerns with SU/Holyforge. With low crits rates this discipline may do less DPS than Mighty Strike when not Beserk and Mighty Strike is a much lower level discipline.<br />
<br />
b. Vadd's Chestplate only has Cleave II on it. This seems somewhat unfair concidering the difficulty in obtaining it compared to Glowing Spiritstone Necklace with Cleave III which can be obtain in QVic. If Cleave should help make Savage Onslaught useful, then items with Cleave should have the amount of Cleave reflect the difficulty in obtaining them.<br />
<br />
c. At this time, at least on my server, the augments &quot;of Pure Sundering&quot; are quite rare. While this might be intentional, it has resulted in the augments being sold by the small handfull of tradeskillers able to produce them for many 100's Kpp. With items like Vadd's BP having only Cleave II the desirability of the tradeskill augments is magnified. Either increase the drop rates of the needed components and lower the skill required to succeed OR insure items with Cleave have the amount of Cleave reflected in the difficulty in obtaining them.<br />
<br />
BB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">12-01-2004, 09:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">if cleave stacks (with discs and each other) then it can help to increase the power of Savage Onslaught. However SO has a &quot;cleave XIII&quot; built in, so a cleave III focus may increase the power of SO by an unparsable amound.<br />
<br />
and remember that 100% crit rate is given by a &quot;cleave M&quot; !!! (see mighty strike) thus cleave III should give us only 0.6% bonus and SO only 2.7% ...</div></div><hr />

Also, did you know Divine Rez does not give you any stamina back?  I found that out one day because I was lazy and didn't feel like waiting for rez effects to wear off on Eriatha, so I DR'd myself.  What a fucking waste.  =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Melee weapons have scaled with other classes to not only yield large increases in melee output, but necessarily higher hate from said melee classes. Easily available weapons in both the bazaar as well as 1 group content have outpaced the weapons available to Warriors to generate aggro. The epic 1.5 was a huge increase concerning ratio'd weapons; however, it relies entirely upon procs that were released over 3 expansions ago. If &quot;anger&quot; is too powerful to put on an augment, then consider a lesser but comparative effect. It should also be available to any Warrior that takes it upon him or herself to obtain it; not locked away in some zone that requires flags.<br />
<br />
Shocking Defense:<br />
<br />
This needs improvement. There's no two ways about it. I feel guilty for having asked for this rune at all. If the issue is that it's a non-linked disc, then link it and make it superior to defensive. We can already move from Furious/Fortitude to Defensive/Stonewall to Aura of Runes (it's almost negligible but if you combine Aura of Runes with Epic clickie it becomes pretty neat.) If the developers don't want to make it a defensive disc versus melee damage, since we already have two, then make it a defensive disc versus spell/aoe damage.</div></div><hr />

As an aside on that issue, I've followed up on one of your posts from another thread on that very issue already, because it's pretty important, and the response was basically &quot;It's something we'll consider in the future, but don't expect to see it happenning in the near future.&quot;<br />
<br />
They're aware of the issue, and will be considering it in the future.   In essence, the concept is that if we're being moved away from LDoN, then we shouldn't be dependent on LDoN throughout our careers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Very true, and the days when our innate 40 MR meant anything are long gone. I like the idea of some sort of spell shield disc and/or innate ability a lot.<br />
<br />
An upgraded resistant disc that actually made us resistant (ie at least as much as having an epic bard) would be nice too.<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
IE it would be great to be able to pop resistant and have a chance to resist chaos claws semi-consistently.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tamener</div><div class="date">12-03-2004, 08:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am prolly a bit late for this update but something I have been looking for, for a few years now is weapon setups! I don't care if I have to buy an AA called quickdraw for 9 points or whatever but if I could have 2 maybe 3 weapon setups that I could switch between by simply hitting ctrl + shift + &lt;#&gt; or whatever it would be very nice.  Considering the generic nature of the AA it should prolly allow you to get as many as 4 setups with a possible boosting to this via another AA.  Then again considering the &quot;epic&quot; level of characters, it should almost be free for melee classes.<br />
<br />
Level 15 you get first setup, basically only allows you to switch TO the setup since you only have one.<br />
<br />
Level 30 you get a second &quot;weapon set&quot;<br />
<br />
Level 45 you get a third &quot;weapon set&quot;<br />
<br />
Level 60 you get a fourth &quot;weapon set&quot;<br />
<br />
and then another one at 70 or whatnot.<br />
<br />
Very similar to what Diablo 2 had now that I think about it.  But would be very useful for me.  I switch between 2h(aggro), 1h's(aggro), 1h/shield (aggro), 1h's(dps), 2h(slowing), 1h's(snaring), and while dps, slowing, and snaring aren't commmon a quick switch between aggro sets would be awesome.<br />

just my thoughts, sorry if this has been brought up before~</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Toronth</div><div class="date">12-03-2004, 02:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1. Taunt. Success rate, particularly the steep decline vs. Yellow/Red mobs, is too low and too unreliable (currently being evaluated)<br />
<br />
Yea this needs to be fixed pretty fast <br />
<br />
2. Re-Evaluate Epic 1.5/2.0 Effect (Epics for all classes are currently being re-evaluated)<br />
<br />
Details: Effect has 3 major issues:<br />
<br />
a. Duration of 60 seconds: Please change to 'until rune aspect is used'<br />
<br />
b. Cast time: Please change to instant<br />
<br />
c. Currently severaly underpowered in relation to Paladin epic click<br />
<br />
Ya I do think they need to be more balanced with other epics <br />
<br />
3. Endurance Regen: We need endurance regen from Spells and/or items. Modrods should provide an endurance benefit equal to the mana benefit. Also, change + Endurance only augments to +Endurance regen. (currently being evaluated)<br />
<br />
I like the mod rod idea, would give me a reason to quit destroying them, and yes OoW discs are too high in endurance cost and the amount of aa's required to boost our endurance regen by a few pts is phenomenal.<br />
<br />
4. Re-Evaluate warrior disciplines. (currently being evaluated)<br />
There's a few issues:<br />
<br />
A. Endurance costs on all of the new discs is WAY too high<br />
<br />
B. Aura of Runes negates the use of inherent proc right clicks. Please consider &quot;suspending&quot; them rather than dispelling them completely.<br />
<br />
C. The level 70 discipline needs to be effective against even con and higher mobs. If it's not reasonable to make level 70+ mobs stunnable (and it's probably not reasonable), then change the effect to a dramatic defensive based damage shield (DD) effect, or a &quot;defensive&quot; hate inducing proc, or something along those lines. As it currently stands, there's not a whole lot of use for the discipline which SHOULD be our best.<br />
<br />
D. Savage onslaught needs a longer timer or shorter refresh and a MUCH lower endurance upkeep.<br />
<br />
a) exactly...<br />
b) ya wouldnt hurt<br />
c) exactly...why give us the disc that should be our most powerful if it is pointless to use. <br />
d) Alright I think this disc is totally pointless and should be taken out of the game because I have yet to find a decent use for it other than the once a month when I go solo somewhere and its cost too damn much<br />
<br />
5. Range attack while pulling (currently being evaluated)<br />
Note: The proliferation of ranged items which eliminate the use of a bow or thrown item without awkward item swapping, it is requested that the 'Throw Stone&quot; skill be unlinked from the incite line, and a longer range placed on it (100ish feet)<br />
<br />
thatd be awesome<br />
<br />
<br />
6. Add a shield disc or shield usefulness (no change planned at this time)<br />
The following are helpful suggestions as to what can be adjusted to shields to make them something desired. Above all, when it comes to shields, we want the option to use them for a noticeable benefit.<br />
<br />
Adjust the effect of Furious Bash, to make it either a standard proc, or a percentage hate modifier. The concept isn't to make shields as good at aggro as dual wielding or using a 2 hand weapon, but to make them a viable option with some tangible benefit.<br />
<br />
Add Shielding or block to shields<br />
<br />
Warrior shields result in a larger DPS decrease than knight shields do based on the nature of knight weapons vs. warrior weapons. A warrior equipped shield should add a +damage modifier to his/her main hand weapon so that when using a shield, the DPS balance continues to exist.<br />
<br />
Shields equippable by tanks should exceed dramatically the stats gained with an offhand weapon. 30AC and 50hp arent' enough benefit to the loss of aggro and damage that occurs when a shield is equipped<br />
<br />
UPDATE: The real issues at this time is aggro generation comparatively with other classes who have this AA ability, who have taken dramatic strides toward tanking parity with us due to Omens launch and content, we take a much larger hit in aggro generation than others, as well as the availability of good main hand only weapons to make the shield AA useful for those without BBoB/Darkblade/Fleshbiter<br />
<br />
Think shields should be reevaluated...no more loss of aggro from, and better benefits for tanking than it has atm.<br />
<br />
7. Improve stun from kick/slam (currently being evaluated)<br />
<br />
Ya<br />
<br />
<br />
8. Melee Focus Effects: The current level of melee foci are too limited. There are no mage summonned melee foci, and melee foci were not retroactively placed on older gear. The current list of foci is also too limited in what it acheives when compared with caster foci. (currently being evaluated)<br />
<br />
9. Please re-evaluate endurance costs on Omens Disciplines/End skills. (currently being evaluated)<br />
<br />
Yes definitely needs to be worked on.<br />
<br />
Note: the cost/benefit ratio of omens discs and skills are fairly extreme, and endurance depletion is occurring, with endurance regen being nil, and in some cases below what it was in Gates, this is an issue.<br />
<br />
10. Increase the pushback on &quot;Press the Attack&quot; and the chance to interrupt on it. (currently being evaluated)<br />
<br />
havent bought it dunno but Im assuming it needs to be tweaked</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">12-03-2004, 02:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My take on the top 10 list:<br />
<br />
1:  Taunt to me is the number 1 issue we have, and seeing it number 1 on our list is gratifying.<br />
<br />
2:  My biggest concern with the epic is not the clicky, but the focus.  Does any other class have as  useless a focus as warriors?<br />
<br />
3:  Yes, please.  Praying for a break soon so you can regen up some endurence sucks.<br />
<br />
4:  Only OoW disc/ability that impressed me in any form was Bazou Bellow.  That seems just wrong, especially in comparison to the increases casters got with spells.  I do not want alot better, but at least a little better would be nice.<br />
<br />
5:  Yes, please.  I carry enough crap in my inventory, having to have a bow and arrows too just adds to the clutter.<br />
<br />
6:  Not a burning issue with me.  Would be nice to see shields more viable, but not an issue that gets me all fired up.<br />
<br />
7:  Would be nice, but again, not a big issue to me.<br />
<br />
8:  Yes!<br />
<br />
9:  Covered by #4 above.  Could we not replace this with something else, as the issue is already covered?<br />
<br />
10:  Again, would be nice, but not a burning issue with me.<br />
<br />
Issues 1, 3 and 5 are the ones that I consider far and away the most important on the list, and would like to see prioritized.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">12-05-2004, 08:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">summary :<br />
<br />
1. Taunt pb : it fails to often.<br />
 =&gt; make it increase in power after a fail so that the more we fail, the less likely to fail it gets.<br />
<br />
2. endurence pb : we run out of endurence to easily and after a death we are out of end power too long.<br />
 =&gt; give shaman a spell that would regenerate our endurence pool quickly. in order to not overpower us, add to this spell a mez effect to remove us from active participation of a group. Plus give us an increased endurence regen while sitting (ala new hp regen : the more we stay on our butt, the more regen we get).<br />
<br />
3. disc power : our new OoW disc (except bazu below) are close to unusefull due to their lack of power and their end cost.<br />
 =&gt; the end cost must be solved via point #2. They have great potential power because they are on separated timers. Howerver their current form does close to nothing, they must be tweaked to not be used only in &quot;oh shit, I have no other disc available&quot; situation.<br />
<br />
4. range slot : either make bow as apealing as new ornementing-range-slot items or give us a pulling tool (ala throw stones on a separated timer and with a larger range).<br />
<br />
5. epic issue : reevaluate epic focus and effect.<br />
=&gt; much to do on them.<br />
<br />
6. offhand slot : we asked for better usefullness of shield since we can't tank with them.<br />
 =&gt; epic is meant to be offhanded, thus replace our shield need by a stronger power of our offhand compared to the primary. with splipery attack, more swings, nicer stats on slow weapon (thus they fit best in offhand), and with the possibility to bash with them we wouldn't need a shield.<br />
Or make shield more usefull than just having twice as much AC as it is listed. with an increase in shielding/spellshield/dot shielding mod-cap and a very large CE it would make them appealing.<br />
<br />
7. kick/bash : we don't stun with them anymore.<br />
=&gt; scale the stun with our lvl.<br />
<br />
8. melee focii : they are great in idee but need improovement.<br />
 =&gt; make them avaiable in lower content (with lower effect). give them more diversity. make them more usefull (unparseable effect on 4H isn't an improove in anything).<br />
<br />
9. active AA / press the attack isn't as great as you wanted it to be.<br />
it was meant to be a &quot;placement tooll&quot; but the push back isn't big enougth for that purpuse. either make it recastable faster (1s) or make it push farer. (BTW, it should have no aggro, isn't it ? so why can't we chain cast it ?).<br />
<br />
10. give us flowers : solve those first three points really fast !</div></div><hr />
