<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>chumchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi,<br />
<br />
I am currently working on the frog faction for crown of deceit.  I've spent 20hrs killing undead frogs in lguk, but frog slaves still scowls at me :mad:.  I m a big fat ogre and follower of Rallos Zek, also killing live frogs when I was teen definitely didn't help.  <br />
<br />
I am just wondering from people that have done the quest how long did you guys spent to raise the faction with live frogs.  I've also heard seb gives better live frogs than undead in guk, is that true?<br />
<br />
Any feedback would be appreciated :D.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Varf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i have cound that seb is much better faction, its defently harder, but get some money too</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>GSW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've had amiable after lots and lots of seb(i mean really lots), then in about 3 hours in lower guk went to warmly. Try getting some wizzy or mage or druid or something...to AE those frogs with ya. Just make sure ya hit em all, then AE them :). I did them the simple way though...just kill hehe. Try getting illusion potions and maybe turn into wood elf...also try getting the ghoul lord scalp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>chumchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks for the replies.  I usually bot me and another 61 druid, so I'll try the AE method.  I have the ghoul lord scalp and that didn't even change my faction at all.  I guess I still have a long way to go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Apothes Drudoll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Go AE all the dead frogs in guk with a couple friends and give them pallys a little payback!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gunrack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">in the same subject.. how about multiquesting?  Heard the cloak or some part of the quest ends up being no drop.. if this is true can the crown be MQed?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gunrack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Nevermind.. I just saw that it says its NOT no drop LOL my bad</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I spent a lot of time in LGuk doing this same thing.. <br />
<br />
After like 4 days solid and still scowling to live frogs, i said to myself &quot;Self... why are you wasting your time so you can look more gay than you already do?&quot;...<br />
<br />
I pulled every single live frog and minotaur in the zone and Rampaged w/Earthshaker.... all of the live side dead in 1 swing and I never felt better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>chumchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Frodlin,<br />
<br />
I feel the same thing after wasted 20hrs...  IF I ever get the crown, I m going to live side and KILL every damn live frogs :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>GSW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">And then there will be an illusion item quest in upper guk that will turn you into something much better than a wood elf, and you will bash your head into the wall :) Heh...actually, i know how it must feel spending so much time for this. Heck, it's not worth it if you have to spend THAT much time on it. You may think &quot;wow, cool, i get to be an elf&quot;, but then you realize how much you love your own race and will rarely use the crown. Nice to have it of course, but not worth 20 hours+ in Lguk</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Lorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I plan on joining any raids that run thru there soon.  It'll prob a take a while and shouldnt be something done in one week.  I guess its best to do it in parts, from time to time.<br />
<br />
Another item you should get is in LGuk.  The GHoul Lord drops a cap that only evil faction large races can use.  This bumps ure faction up about one lvl too when you wear it.  Kill the ghoul lord for this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Aldarion_Shard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">naw, I considered it worth it.  AE is fun, therefor any excuse for AE is worth it.  and while elfs look gay its true, it is useful indeed (e.g. I never would have been able to finish cloak of pernicity quest without it).<br />
<br />
But yes, the An_Old_Froglok has died at my hands many times since.  Finish quest - click crown - kill old froglok.  over, and over, and over...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>aakla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">What I have heard...<br />
<br />
back &quot;In the day&quot; faction was -20000 to +2000 or something like that. later they changed it to -2000 to -2000 but it didnt change the faction you already had if you where in the -. so those of us that where maxed kos where still at -20000 when they changed it. <br />
<br />
not sure if this is true or not but it would explain why i have been to lower guk like 30+ times for hours at a shot. and seb like 7 times for hours, and im still KoS. even tossing the mask on im still kos sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>FarlanderB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">What helps faction in Seb? Any particular type of frog?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>chumchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Far,<br />
<br />
You can kill any type of frogs in Seb to raise faction with Frog of Guk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Wompem Ondahed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">When the quest first came out I thought I would never try it, too much work. But after XPing in Seb and searching for RBG, Hiero Cloak, and Cobalt Bracer, I got the message &quot;Your faction with Froglocks of Guk could not possibly get any better&quot;. When I saw that, and realized I didn't have to farm faction, that it came naturally from dungeon crawling, I went balls to da wall and finished my Crown in abuot 2 weeks (then stayed in Seb for another week trying to get my wife hers). <br />
<br />
I use the Crown for the good vision, for walking freely in most 'good' towns, and when combined with my Cobalt Bracer, I can wall mobs and corner tank easier without my big arse in the way. Btw, it has saved me probably 1k in potions so far while working on my epic. Now that I don't have to go back, I slaughtered the gaurds to the Wiz guild ( they deserved it, I swear).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Tuklak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I have spent more than 20 hours farming faction in LGuk and I know the zone better than at the beginning but I'm still rta with the frogloks of Guk. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, I can't use the lord scalp as it is wearable only by those who have a god so I know I have a lot of ghouls to kill before having the good faction.<br />
<br />
As I have the crown from Seb, I want to finish the quest even if it ll take more than 50 hours :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Wompem Ondahed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">If you max faction and it still isn't enough, go buy a potion of Illusion: Wood Elf, then you are set.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Tuklak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Thanks, I think it will help at the end :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Dima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Oh, you can MQ the Nodrop parts, but the other person HAS to have warmly+ Faction or the old froggie will devour the item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>CATEIRE</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">any info on how long after dubious? spent 4 hours and still dubious...... blah</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>lamini</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">no joke...  i solod the halls of sebillis a good 20hours the last couple months.  Conned the old frog in guk to get indif.  I got a friend mage.  Pulled hall from disco, then from zone out, then from zone in, and the last other hall... did this twice, conned old froglok, and was amiable.  The AE's took about less than 1hr.  I imagine next time the same places again several times i'll hit ally /shrug... i imagine it would be a lot faster with more nukers ;p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Tima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I almost went out of my mind farming fac for this. During a rampage session, a druid friend cast Feral Pack on me (ldon indoor wolf illusion spell) and I went from mid amiable to high warmly enough to finish the quest.<br />
<br />
So farm fac until ya get mid amiable then drag a druid down to Guk to wolf ya and you should be good to go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">hmm next time im in guk i should check my faction with the live frogs. its starting to bug me having to shrink multiple times on raids and i cant find a cobby bracer for love or money on my server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Ylander</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">If you are doing the guk faction as a solo warrior and have dead side to yourself, to maximize the number of kills i recommend you to start clearing from the safehall towards the zoneline of upper guk and kill every frog you can find. <br />
<br />
The frogs on this side have significantly lower amount of hps compared to the frogs on the other side of Safehall but net the same faction hit. When everything on that side is cleared, go back to safehall. If nothing have repopped yet, start clearing the other side until things start to repop on the 'lower' side again.<br />
<br />
Also afaik Sebilis frogs does not give any more faction hits then lower guk, both dungeons net the same faction hit i.e. one faction hit per dead frog.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Grendonbb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Anyone who says this crown isn't worth the effort is a person who was too lazy to finish it.  I had one of the first ones on my server (I think first, but I don't know for sure), and I use it nonstop (hence my sig being an ogre lookin in the mirror and seein a wood elf ;) )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>icecoldbones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">i did this quest and i was max kos to live frog's and this is befor i found out seb frog's give me the faction<br />
<br />
get 1 cleric 1 wiz and go to aoe town after about 3day's i hit  just none kos after ya get to indif it go up alot after there is hope :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Very helpful quest for large races or races that have hard time corner tanking. I was set on doing this quest until I got a circlet of disguise from VT. Being a Vah Shir attempting to corner tank got me no where because of my tail.:(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Sargman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">earthshaker makes it easy to solo this, just pull a bunch of frogs, find a corner and go to town....other options, get with a cleric or druid, and you pull everything and attack whatever, while the cleric uses an undead ae, or get other assorted ae classes with you and go to town. getting out of KoS is the hardest part, other than that amiable seems to take awhile but it only took a couple of hours  to go from kindly to warmly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Dima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Ladies love the WE. Just steadly kill if you don't have a shaker, you'll have it in a week or so. I cheated and used enchanter imp illusion (now nerfed, though =/) for +2 faction levels the first week of this quest :oo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>minet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">faction goes up realy slow :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Gasmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Is this worse than OT gate hammer? i've turned in like 120 braids &lt;too poor to buy puppet strings for 65k&gt; and i'm still dubious. Also does anyone know if puppet strings will provide the proper faction to do crown of deceit quest ? if it does it might be worth me spending 65k to get OT gate hammer and crown of deceit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Spliskin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">The old froglock is not affected by charm spells.. so no it wont work.  Best faction modifier is still the ldon druid indoor wolf form spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Nazgrub</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Just thought I'd put in my 2 cp.  I am an agnostic ogre warrior who camped the king for the fabled mithril 2hander so my faction for live guk was bad, not bottomed, but pretty bad.  I spent about 5 hours solo in lguk, and got to dubious, then i spent about 4-5 more hours in guk.  Recently I've gone to Seb with a group of friends and after about a 8-10 hours there i am warmly.  It seems to me that Seb is either a.) better faction adjustment or b.) not as mind-numbingly boring so it doesn't feel like it's taking forever.  Plus I got myself a nice amount of loot from Seb.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Dubb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">No, it's definitely not worse than raising Overthere faction, although if you start dubious in OT and start scowls to frogs, they may seem equally as bad.<br />
<br />
I raised both from max KOS.  Warmly with frogs in order the quest the crown. Amiable to VS (with illusion, still scowling without illusion) in order to quest the hammer (http://www.thesafehouse.org/viewtopic.php?t=4516) (yes I'm aware you can charm the Foreman).  Frog faction was far less work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Nazgrub</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Hmmm, new problem, nobody on my server appears to tough the Mastadons in WW anymore, no cloaks for sale in bazaar and no furs either.  My faction w/dragons sucks so as far as I know not really an option to go there, /sigh.  Any ideas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Dakryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">I pulled every single live frog and minotaur in the zone and Rampaged w/Earthshaker.... all of the live side dead in 1 swing and I never felt better.<br />
<br />
Heck, I got my crown and still go down just for the fun of the lag spike when they all die at one time.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Nazgrub</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Alright, I got all the pieces for the cloak, but when tailor tries to do combine it says these items cannot be combined in this container.  I have the Coldain Tanner's Kit and all the correct parts ( 4 Velium Mastodon fur's, 1 Vial of Purified Mana, 1 Platinum Thread and 1 Cloak Pattern ) and the furs are not stacked, is this combine bugged?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Lorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Was wondering about the Seb Reet Crown.  Are the Reets soloable by a 65 Warrior?  I can invis down past the shrooms, but wasnt sure about the Juggs or Reet camp itself.  Im assuming I need to snare them too to avoid adds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Bulbog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Ehh probably they are but it's a really bad idea heh.  Ideally you want someone with paci to come down with you otherwise some of the reets you can't single pull I don't think as a solo warrior.  Really would be a pain in the ass to do if you could just convince a cleric friend or something to come you'd be way better off.  Personally I two boxed it with my warrior + cleric but I don't think I would've tried it solo.</div></div><hr />
