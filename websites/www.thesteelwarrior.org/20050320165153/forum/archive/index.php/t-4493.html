<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TaiilChayser</div><div class="date">11-21-2003, 02:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did it when I took over a friends account. Moved the one character I would play to one of my accounts and then cancled his account because I didn't want to pay for 3 if I didnt have to.<br />
<br />
They completed the transfer in about 48 hours without so much as a peep about orriginal account info.. of course that's because the charge was approved on my CC.. which is all they really care about.</div></div><hr />

No go like 15 times I&quot;ve tried it.</div></div><hr />
