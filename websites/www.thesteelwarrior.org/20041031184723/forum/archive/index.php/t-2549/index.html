<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>nyyhte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What's harder to get Eyepatch of Plunder or Red Epic? I'm really just curious about these two quests. So I thought I'd throw this out. DE's are so devious.<br />
<br />
/em grins evilly</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ornate gauntlets are easier to get than eye patch of plunder and &lt;insert any of 10-20 weapons here&gt; is better agro and easier to get than red epic</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zackulle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Unless you wanna buy epic parts from bazaar eyepatch is alot easier to get, and more worth the time put into it.  I got my epic a little before velious came out and even then it sucked.. go spend 15k on a copper hammer of striking or somethin like that</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Roughbeard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Eyepatch of Plunder is always useful.. Epic goes out of usefullness after a while.. but its still looks cool :p If ya have the time, and patiance, and know that it will last you a while, and dont want to spend money on better weapons that cost less than it would to MQ 1 piece of your epic, and you want to camp Sev, and you want PoA hell, and if your guild can do Chardok pretty regularily, and your guild likes to break fear, do your lightsabers :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have EoP, no epic, no ornate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Stormfeather is the only hard part of getting EoP. There are countless pain in the ass parts to get for your epic.<br />
<br />
You can farm enough plats to buy a copper hammer AND ornate gaunts in the time it would take you to do either quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">iirc eop is one long camp for stomrfeather and a gankfest camp for lodi and both can be done with less than a group.<br />
<br />
epic is a even harder gankfest for sev (at least on my server) and a lot of pita raids that no one really wants to do anymore. ive almost done my epic but i know which one is definiteyl easier.</div></div><hr />
