Warrior<br />
<br />
    * Training costs adjusted. Total training cost was slightly increased.<br />
    * Battle Shout - Rage cost reduced.<br />
    * Bloodrage - Health cost reduced.<br />
    * Heroic Strike - Damage increased.<br />
    * Parry - Moved to level 6.<br />
    * Thunder Clap - Now causes Physical damage instead of Nature damage; damage increased; duration increased with each new rank. Improved Sunder Armor - Now decreases rage cost by 1/1/1. Improved Thunder Clap - Now decreases rage cost by 1/1/2.<br />
    * Execute - Full rage is no longer consumed when the ability does not hit.<br />
    * Overpower - Should now be usable when a special attack is dodged.<br />
    * Fixed a bug where rage was not being generated when normal melee attacks were parried, dodged, and blocked.<br />
    * Charge has been improved so it will work through doorways and won't path you through an entire dungeon.<br />
    * Sweeping Strikes bug fixed. It will hit more reliably and show up in combat log correctly.<br />
    * Added a visual to Sword Specialization &quot;proc&quot; that will now show up in the combat log as well. <br />
<br />
Hooray!</div></div><hr />

<br />
we're one of the few, if not the only, class this applies to. bonus to those of us who have hit 60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">slitz</div><div class="date">03-07-2005, 06:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">While I'll wait to judge it until trying it out myself, I'm not all that impressed with the changes. There is still the issue with tactical mastery IMO that limits the builds to Fury/Arms, Arms/Fury or Arms/Prot. <br />
However, the none warrior related stuff looks nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Isk</div><div class="date">03-07-2005, 06:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yes, this definitely further pushes an advantage for the average warrior to Arms. Prot warriors provide a nice edge on raids, and I'm not really sure what else can be done to benefit the efficiency of the people who raid with you without overpowering us.</div></div><hr />

Hooray!<br />
<br />
<br />
Training - yeah whatever.<br />
Battle Shout - out of left field, but reduced cost is good.<br />
Bloodrage - good good.<br />
H-Strike - who can complain ?<br />
Parry - is that down or up ? I forget, at any rate level 6 is the first 10 minutes so who cares.<br />
Thunderclap - Good.<br />
Improved Sunder - nerf to single group, buff to raiders.  At 12 vs 15 I am not sure that anyone would really find it worth it, needs testing.<br />
Execute - Great change ( why is it that, in a duel with a druid, he will dodge once during the entire fight - right as you execute as he switches back to human form to use his instant heal ;p )<br />
Overpower - Good.<br />
Rage on parries - Ours or theirs ? Ours = good, theirs = meh.<br />
Charge - never noticed this, bound to make someone happy though.<br />
Sweeping Strikes - cosmetic bugfix, null impact.<br />
Sword Spec  proc - see above.<br />
<br />
As a quick request - can anyone post the full text here ? I can't see the blizz site due to firewall restrictions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greysen</div><div class="date">03-07-2005, 07:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looks like some overall good changes.  Looks like heroic strike is getting de-sucked somewhat, making it useful now hopfully.  I think the sunder fix is excellent in general, takes care of stacking issues completely.  60 vs 75 rage for 5 sunders is pretty solid in most situations too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">03-07-2005, 07:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think people would post the patch notes, if it wasn't for the fact that they freaking LONG.<br />
<br />
I think these are interesting changes.  I'm interested to see how they improved Thunderclap.  Execute fix is good, I know that pissed a bunch of people off.  Bloodrage fix can make a lot of difference for those that used it.<br />
<br />
I don't know, a lot of small interesting changes, with the big one (Rage on parry/dodge/block...I'm going to assume ours, btw) still in question as to how it would improve things.</div></div><hr />

And had commentary regarding the group changes.  But whatever.  I'm PSMing so I'll chalk it up to that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some comments :<br />
<br />
Block: All creatures will now report a Block on attacks from the front, reducing damage caused instead of converting the attack into a &quot;Miss.&quot; Creatures will no longer be able to Block attacks from behind. <br />
<br />
Great !<br />
<br />
Blocking an ability that takes place on the next swing now blocks the normal amount of damage instead of all of it. <br />
<br />
Doh ! Some fights just got an awful lot harder ;p. Non prot spec can probably take this as a general bonus.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mummified Atal'ai will no longer cast Fevered Plague so often. <br />
<br />
Pfft, what was wrong with an instant cast 500DD nuke that took no mana and had no recycle time ? ;p<br />
<br />
<br />
The effect of the Spirit of Aquamentas and Choker of Enlightenment has changed to a +damage and +healing of all spell schools effect. <br />
<br />
Excellent, just what we needed with the complaints about atrocious caster itemisation, a nerf to the two caster items that were actually useful. <br />
<br />
Ramstein's Lightning Bolts effect reduced to 200 points of damage and a 10-yard radius. <br />
<br />
G'dammit !<br />
<br />
<br />
Fixed a bug that was causing Thrash Blade, Flurry Axe, and Ironfoe to have an additional attack when the effect went off. <br />
<br />
But didn't fix the bug where heroic strike eats them of course.  Sigh. Oh well, a general nerf to the most popular weapon in the game.<br />
<br />
Fixed a bug on Gearforge Girdle (awarded by the Felwood quest, A Final Blow) that caused it to have more stats than it should. It no longer has +12 defense. <br />
<br />
Prot spec gear nerfs make baby jesus cry.<br />
<br />
Deathstriker name changed to Felstriker.<br />
Rend's treasure table has been modified. <br />
<br />
Offering 2:1 odds on a new, nerfed to hell, deathstriker replacing the old one - any takers ? ;p<br />
<br />
A new engineering recipe is available in Blackrock Depths for a repair robot. This robot acts as a repair vendor for 10 minutes and will repair and purchase items for normal cost. This will allow dungeon groups and raids to get items repaired and sold without returning to town. <br />
<br />
Brilliant change. I wonder if it's reusable and if it has horrific item requirements ( woot 20 arcanite and non reusable for the win )<br />
<br />
<br />
Bottomless Bag requires significantly more mooncloth and two core leather to make now. <br />
<br />
.......... why I oughtta.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tarkas</div><div class="date">03-08-2005, 12:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So they're gutting block and sunder and giving us a bunch of battle stance window dressing, leaving no incentive whatsoever to spec prot. AWESOME!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spawn600</div><div class="date">03-08-2005, 12:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Prot doesnt come out to badly with rage generation on block. I'm a bit upset that imp bloodrage is going to be worthless though, because I'm not giving up last stand.<br />
<br />
<br />
E: I don't think that fullblocks on next melee were anywhere near fair although I will miss them.<br />
<br />
Also imp sunder should go 1/1/2 or 1/2/2 to remain closer to the same vaule:<br />
<br />
1.3/15 == 0.08667 (before)<br />
<br />
1/13 ==    0.07692 (after)<br />
1/12 ==    0.08333 (closer to same value with out going over)<br />
1/11 ==    0.09091 (over yet still closer than 1/1/1)</div></div><hr />
