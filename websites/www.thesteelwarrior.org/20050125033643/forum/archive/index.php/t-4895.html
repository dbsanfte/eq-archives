<br />
           Well I've been playing EverQuest since Kunark but have only recently starting playing a pure melee. Up until now my main has been a Wizard. Yes, I know quite a switch if I'm playin' a warrior -- but you guessed it, I had to make one and I love it. While Gankan will never replace my Wizard as my main he's certainly my second favorite and I want to get him to 65 just as badly as I do my wizard. <br />
<br />
           Naturally I'm sure ya'll can recognize the change of pace going from a Wizard to a Warrior including the learning curve for equipment and such... but I think I did a pretty fair job equipping him. <br />
<br />
           Point is; I've seen several posts asking for the same thing I am and I'd sure appreciate it if I could get some honest answers too. =) Would love if ya'll could give some good suggestions for armor/equipment upgrades. If you look in my bags you'll notice I already have the CHoS and SoTB combo lined up, just waiting until I'm a little closer to 50 before I switch out.<br />

Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />

Judging by the rest of your gear, I think it's safe to say you've got plenty of plat to throw around. If we're talking mostly droppable stuff, ditch the orc fang earring and get a Bloodmetal Earring of Engagement. I'd also replace each ring with a Valorium Ring of Gallantry. You might also think of replacing that Tegi's bracer with another Silver Chitin. I have that Cacti necklace in my resist gear bag. You might consider an Amulet of Mummy Wrappings. Thinking forward, you'll probably want to replace your legs and boots after a while, but even without my suggestions, you're pretty well equipped already and probably will be for a while...<br />
<br />
EDIT: Oh btw, I think you're going to want to give me the windblade. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neksnappa</div><div class="date">12-22-2003, 10:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looks like a good start, and let me start by saying I hope you enjoy the warrior class, which should seem refreshing after being a finger-wriggler.<br />
<br />
Everything Ghar pointed out is sound advice, and I actually typed out about 90% of what he said before I read what he posted and realized it was already said, so there's some stuff to look for.<br />
<br />
One other comment would be to look for something like Grey Flesh sleeves, or any others with decent ac, as well as stam/hp. I never was much of a fan for cobalt; having nothing but ac on an item just seems like a waste of a slot to me.<br />
<br />
Other than the suggestions Ghar gave you, I'd just say to level up, and look for thurg/SS armor once you get another 10 levels or so, and then maybe grab a few cheap pieces of ornate armor after level 55. Or you could just skip both steps and save up for the LDoN plate armor, which will last you until the e-planes easily.<br />
<br />
Happy twinking,</div></div><hr />

<br />
Got level 43 and I figured I'd finally swap out my BAB since I'm closer to its full usefullness. So I now have my CHoS and SoTB combo in full swing, as it were. ;)<br />
<br />
Also traded up the Cobalt arms for some with a little lower AC but nice STA. I couldn't find any of the other items ya'll suggested but I'll keep an eye out for them... and of course, I'll keep leveling too.<br />
<br />
Thanks again -- take another look and let me know if you see anything else now that I've made a few of your suggested changes.</div></div><hr />
