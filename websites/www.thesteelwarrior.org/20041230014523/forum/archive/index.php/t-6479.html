<br />
Gear is not a problem can buy full RZ off the bat.<br />
<br />
1. Will I regret making a DE later? Dont tell me about Ogres I could care less about frontal stun, they are horrible looking and waaay to big, same goes for trolls. I open to other race sugestions. Kinda been looking at Half Elf's.<br />
<br />
2. If I never get into a ele/time guild, will i be able to max STR and STA unbuffed? <br />
<br />
3. Do Dark Elfs have a problem with maxing all stats in ele/time gear unbuffed?<br />
<br />
4. Is it possible for a DE to have the most HP out of any other war in eq or are the higher sta races able to dump more sta gear and get more hp at the very end game say in time gear? I assume the best sta/str gear has the best HP as well, aleast I hope so!<br />
<br />
I really would apreciate any advice.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

Play what makes you happy, starting stats are meaningless when you hit the end game.<br />
<br />
<br />
2. If I never get into a ele/time guild, will i be able to max STR and STA unbuffed? <br />
<br />
<br />
Yes, depends on how much time you play.  If you can get full ldon gear with some decent augs it's very similar to VT gear.<br />
<br />
<br />
3. Do Dark Elfs have a problem with maxing all stats in ele/time gear unbuffed?<br />
<br />
<br />
No<br />
<br />
<br />
4. Is it possible for a DE to have the most HP out of any other war in eq or are the higher sta races able to dump more sta gear and get more hp at the very end game say in time gear? I assume the best sta/str gear has the best HP as well, aleast I hope so!<br />
<br />
<br />
Theoretically the answer to that is yes.  305 sta is the cap, so it doesn't matter if you are a DE or an Ogre,  you can't get more than that.  So, it comes down to aa's, gear and augments.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sta maxes. Direct hp is god. I also think you are putting to much emphasiss on str. Str is the easiest stat to max. May want to look into dex, agi, and perhaps cha a bit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
however i did start the game with 125 dex naked, hitting wasn't too much of a problem and neither were skills.<br />
<br />
And why do you need to MAX out your stats unbuffed? ideally all you need to do is get them high enough so that they max WHEN you get buffs.... alot easier that way.<br />

<br />
No.<br />
Later on the only difference between ye and other races will be appearance and racial abilities.<br />
Stalwart Endurance will help equalize ye with Ogres.<br />
<br />
2. If I never get into a ele/time guild, will i be able to max STR and STA unbuffed? <br />
<br />
I am not ele or time.... Or even VT.<br />
I can self buff to 305 with ornate grieves and all combat stats be 305 raid buffed.<br />
<br />
3. Do Dark Elfs have a problem with maxing all stats in ele/time gear unbuffed?<br />
<br />
Although I dont know for sure, Im going to have to say no problem.<br />
<br />
4. Is it possible for a DE to have the most HP out of any other war in eq or are the higher sta races able to dump more sta gear and get more hp at the very end game say in time gear?<br />
<br />
STA is easier to max then you think.<br />
All races are pretty much equal end game.<br />
The cap is 305.<br />
<br />
My only problem stat so far is CHA.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I did that last night with halflings.  3 on the whole server.  1 were mules in the Bazaar &amp; one was level 19 in Blackburrow. :(<br />
<br />
I'm running the Ogre warrior type right now.  DE's I've always loved.  Iksar then DE rate as my favorite EQ races.  The only thing that just PISSES me off about DE's are their wrist slots.  When it comes to gear for a warrior is a Bracelet of Fortitude &amp; Might.  Well, you deck them out is nice gear &amp; what shows?  Their damn newbie robe sleeves... :(  Curse the Bracelets for not having a graphic...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">04-02-2004, 09:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Eh, what it boils down to for me is that different races have these minor inconveniences.<br />
I'm a Barb and I haven't had to worry about bash. And for a long time I've never had to think about carrying too much weight: I carry a bag of weapons, a bag of resist gear and potions, a bag of food and stat food, a bag of bandages...bleh, who knows what I'm carrying. Doesn't matter because I'm never encumbered.<br />
On the other hand, every time I die I'm blind. So, my minor inconvenience is that depending on my place of death, I might go to the bank and put some cheap lightsource on while I wait for a rez.<br />
In other words, you might have to deal with weight problems for a little while, but at least you can see. However, eventually your weight/encumberance problems will just go away in the normal course of gearing up.<br />
If what you really want to do is GM jewelcraft, a DE warrior is not a particularly good choice. Being a DE warrior is a disaster if you want to tinker, lol. If you want to kill kill kill and be an effective tank, then you're good to go.<br />
If i were starting my warrior today I'd be very tempted to put all my starting points into CHA anyway, no matter what race I picked.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I need some CHA, which is another stat dark elves are low on but I can build that up when it's a greater issue :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not even close. I have all melee skills well over max unbuffed, and am a handful of points from maxing int and wis also unbuffed. Only stat thats difficult to raise is charisma, but thats a problem everyone has regardless of race or what guild youre in. With the way gear is today raising stats is almost as easy as breathing.</div></div><hr />

Even so, CHA isn't a factor until end game correct?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also with the new graphics engine DE is doing well with their Infravision at the lower levels... nice to be able to see well most all the time. <br />
<br />
Get Dragon Hero Bracers for the graphic - yur right its hard to find good wrists with graphic but those will do the job, you only need one put them in the left side and equip them last. My mana threaded bone bracer dosn't have a graphic either but I can show a graphic anytime.</div></div><hr />

Yes BUT if you do hit the end game you will find it a pain in the butt to raise.  Better to plan ahead.</div></div><hr />

Looks is very important in my book, 5 dps or a better looking sword, I take the looks. Can you imagin playing an ogre with the original models LOL..... a cartoon character... <br />
<br />
I took off boots with better stats for ones with a plate look.... (something wanderor). <br />
<br />
And the end of the game looks is all that will differentiate you and everyone else.... <br />
<br />
As for CHA, I sold my Cloak of Flames finally and got the fabled waist thing so out with rubicite girdle and CoF and in with fabeld shase and Cloak of Pernicity with gives that nice 25CHA (and 25Str but thats to easy to max).</div></div><hr />

As far as looks go--I would play in stick figure mode if I could so it would reduce lag.  If your character performs well that is way more important than looks.  Sam says looks &gt; 5 dps but I think its the other way.  I tried playing an ogre once and the way they seem to run so slow and got stuck on things was too annoying to me so I picked a dark elf just to avoid the size problems in dungeons and so I could see in the dark.  One thing I regret is I picked agnostic and if I could do it over I would have picked rallos zek but back then it was more important to have good faction so that you didn't get attacked by every npc you saw and there was no fierce heraldic armor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As a noob, I assumed CHA would offset DE faction issues.<br />
For years I assumed I made a huge mistake by putting all points into CHA. *LOL*<br />
<br />
As for armor graphic, I would have to say the robed Jedi knight look is better...<br />
<br />
Just dont tank high end mobs with it.<br />
With PoV, BoT, and Tactics mobs you can get away with it though :)<br />
<br />
If you have a chanter, have him NDT you with robe on, then switch to your normal armor.<br />
When it wears off, it still shows the robe graphic.<br />
Why? I have no elvenly idea.<br />

<br />
<br />
I picked Dark elf, warrior, rallos zek...way back then...because looking around the server it seemed to be the rarest possible class/race/deity combo there was :) (FH armour made it more common later :()<br />
<br />
Faction with RZ was never really an issue...I think I was able to wander freely in:<br />
<br />
Neriak (all)<br />
Freeport (almost all, not mages in west but north was fine)<br />
Qeynos (most, np with guards pre-treant hunting)<br />
HHK(and highpass)<br />
Grobb<br />
Oggok<br />
<br />
Without any faction work :)<br />
And now I can wander those plus, RV, Kaladim, Kelethin and Felwithe.<br />
<br />
Oh yea and I agree with looks &gt; all...this is a game about fun after all :p</div></div><hr />

You are now the coolest looking person in Norrath. I know this because I look cool, well I think I do and that is really what matters :)<br />
<br />
Oh, and I have no issues with stats.<br />

The only thing that sucks is their plate-helm graphic, and until ornate there are very few good helms with the no-graphic look on them :/</div></div><hr />

I play a DE warrior on Kane (like the only high end one) and its awesome to look so damn good and tank with the best of them too.  When ogres were begging for illusions to pin shit i was just shrinking.  As far as stats go, we're just starting to farm EP I'm pretty much geared in VT/luclin stuff and i've maxed str &amp; sta.  Dex maxes with buffs and Agi well that needs some work.  Don't think i'd be doing any better as another class.<br />

<br />
As I've stated earlier, I just want to look bad arse :P  Like it's been stated here, race is all about the looks.  The advantage given by the other races such as not being able to be stunned can be gain via  Alternate Advance skills.  I'm a Half Elf and both my STR, and STA are maxed without any buffs while DEX, and AGI both max out with buffs - heck just look at the magelo profile. :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thorvak</div><div class="date">04-14-2004, 08:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My first warrior was a Barbarian during orignal everquest. I lost interest in him for my necromancer for two years.  After that time i rolled a ogre warrior.  He was fun but i hated the graphics on them.  So i made an iksar warrior.  He was also fun but the types of armor i could use at lower lvls was a total pain.  I thought for a long time ogre due to no frontal stun was statistacally the best warrior.  I like the graphics on trolls the most, but im a perfectionist and it was a dilema for me to go with troll even though i liked them roleplay wise a bit more.<br />
<br />
The moral of this story is this - my Troll warrior is now 65 with all max'd stats, and has aa's to avoid getting stunned from every direction.  He has racial regen and only minor ac difference then an iksar of the same quality.  If i had not went back and forth with races trying to pick the &quot;best&quot; race, my Troll would be more powerful then he is today.<br />
<br />
As a warrior STR/DEX/STA/AGI are insanely easy to get up high end, picking a race just to fit those stats is silly if you are actually planning to play him high end.<br />
<br />
At high end its the time and dedication put into a warrior that makes him good, not the button you clicked on during creation.  If you like the looks of dark elves the most, by all means roll a dark elf.</div></div><hr />
