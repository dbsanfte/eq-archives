<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>JaeceRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">well im a 35 warrior where should i go besides DL or OT i find those boring i want somethin with deent loot and god exp and FUN and preferably not anything in velious cuz skins are messed up and everything looks like hum males and i dont got LoY....any suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Lower Guk and Sol B spring to mind. No clue how easy/hard it would be to find a group though. Last time I was there (a LONG time ago) there were at least some groups still there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Greyslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Most of the time Lguk is farmage land now at least on my server.  Haven't been to Sol B in ages only other place I can think of off-hand would be Dawnshroud :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gunrack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">dawnshroud till 40 or so and then head to dulak's harbor (yes thats in LoY and I know you don't have it but man that place rocks)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Meface</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you can get a partner and make sure they gonna be around for awile the best exp an cash spot I have seen is gunthak for that level. At 35 do the beach and front of the tunnel. Then around 39-40 head over to the initiate stairs. Lets put it this way i went from 39 - 50 in the same spot with me and my buddy's druid here. The cash is not bad either usually made about 500-1000 p a sessions(4-5 hours) Then it was port druid up sell port back down. The exp is awesome.!!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Scaleclad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Granted Luclin and LoY did not exsist at the time, but I found ToFS a very fun zone to do with a small group.  Floor 2 till 37ish (near infinate mobs if your the only group), 3 till 40something, 4 just to get to 5, since its the most deadly imo.  5 till upper 40's if you want, and 6 is decent at 51, 52ish.  I did RH in Sol B as well but they patched it since then to new and harder mobs.  I have not exped there since then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>moglar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">most my characters (4? yeah 4) leveled 32 - 39 in OT.  Well, all I can say about OT is BLEK!  Forget OT.  Great exp, but too boring!  Go for dalnir with a small gorup ( drop down , include a canter and a cleric ) if your staying in kunark.  The old nurga mines come too mind.  Hard at 35 but doable with a full group.  Oh well, not no more!  I loved nurga in high 30s.<br />
<br />
DL over OT for sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kuvil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I would go to GD and kill giants. Great faction also and money isnt  bad eaither. And its easy to get a group there. When u hit 40 get loy and go to dulak, that place rocks, some great drops also that are worth alot of money at your lvl!</div></div><hr />
