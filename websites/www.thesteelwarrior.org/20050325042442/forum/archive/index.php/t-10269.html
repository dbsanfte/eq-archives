where is our weapon?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Sure will be nice to see it, considering the only high end aggro weapons (dual wield) to come out of OoW so far are Thunderclap and maybe Allin's Mace (if you consider Rune III decent aggro). .........(yeah yeah epic is nice too)<br />
<br />
What are you all expecting to see from this weapon anyways, and....do you think it exists? Just hoping it's not  a drop from the Overlord himself  :eek:</div></div><hr />

What makes you think there's a high end warrior specific weapon in Anguish?<br />
<br />
Nothing I've seen coming out of anguish thus far has given the slightest hint there's a class specific weapon set in OoW other than the epics. Sure, there's a few knight or mnk/bst class restricted items, but that's common throughout the game.</div></div><hr />

But honestly i do hope that we do NOT get another 1H weapon.<br />
<br />
There is absolutely no reason at all to give warriors another 1H.<br />
<br />
There are enough mainhand weapons (Epic / BBoB / Flesh / DBlade / Whip) that<br />
can be used with a decent ratio offhander (i wont even bother listing) to tank.<br />
<br />
Since (i can only guess) people end up using 1H+Shield after the first 20 30 secs, the<br />
need for 2 good weapons doesnt exist. <br />
<br />
Exept of course if Epic2 completion rate is too slow (that could be a problem, you should<br />
be able to finish 1 epic per named or something like that).<br />
<br />
What i would really like to see is some really badass 2H, something like an MSC on steroids.<br />
That will not lead to an abysmal gap in stats we see today. What do i mean ?<br />
<br />
Darkblade+SoS = 130ac 3% 420hp<br />
Darkblade+EoE = 65ac 0% 405hp<br />
MSC = 55ac 370hp<br />
<br />
I know the dps/agro is not the same, but give us a break, i'm comparing Time to Adaptation...</div></div><hr />

Nothing I've seen coming out of anguish thus far has given the slightest hint there's a class specific weapon set in OoW other than the epics. Sure, there's a few knight or mnk/bst class restricted items, but that's common throughout the game.<br />
<br />
There's also a berzerker only weapon - boy were we glad when that dropped for us! /who ber all = only two zerkers over L30 on the entire server, one at 59 and one 67.<br />
<br />
Show me a ranger only weapon, or a necro only weapon and maybe I'll chow down on some humble pie. Until then, the fact they've just decided to split up the pal/sk and mnk/bst weapons into seperate drops (when they've historically had far more class restricted weapons than any other classes) doesn't hint to me that there's a war one out there superior to BBoB other than Epic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Terrok</div><div class="date">01-18-2005, 04:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">/cheer, SoE has done it again. 380 mana on a monk only weapon. I just hope we get 400+ mana. I never seem to have enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Celeritum</div><div class="date">01-18-2005, 11:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Demo, if they're going to make class - not archtype, but CLASS - specific weapons of any type, then they should follow through with the rest of the classes. From a purely practical stand point, Time is over two years old, and many guilds have abandoned GoD. If you weren't in a guild during their time-raiding, or if your guild doesn't do GoD, or hell if you even missed the boat during both eras of raid-content, then you are SOL on the weapons previously mentioned. And when you get to that point, the developers SHOULD account for the fact that some kind of high-end 1 hand aggro weapon needs to be put somewhere in Omens.  Really, there should be no need to argue that point.<br />
<br />
And don't wave the epic in front of my face like it's the end all. Sure, the 2.0 looks really nice, especially with the changes going into it, but knights, monks, beastlords and shadowknights got epics AND class specific weapons, there might be more out there, there may not be, but rogues are getting crystal daggers and anuek eye daggers and rangers are getting Frozen Gelidian Bows and there is a slew of 2hs that beserkers would absolutely creme over - there's really no reason why Warriors should not get the same. And if the Matchless Silvery Claymore is THE weapon for us in Omens, it needs some shaping up, with the very least a boost to stats, in particular a damn good amount of shielding to make me give up wielding my epic - and perhaps some HPs and AC as well.</div></div><hr />

It's DPS is less then most 1HX Combos from same time. It's HP's are barely above Epic 2.0's <br />

2HX Weapons died for good after PoP.. At least from Any reasonable standpoint</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rueeliar</div><div class="date">01-19-2005, 11:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That is a very important point to make and one which I had overlooked until now.  I mean no offense, but the classes which have their own weapons showing up in Anguish are the ones who have definite reasons to use different setups and an epic which falls under a different classification than the Anguish weapons being found.  A knight using their epic will be forgoing the benefits that a shield can offer, something that many knights are very reluctant to do (with very good reason).  The bow from the Jelvan event is not class-specific, though only one class can effectively use it for reasonable dps.  The monk staff... I honestly cannot begin to comprehend why there are monks which would use a 2hander if a dual-wield combo exists that can outdo it, providing greater damage, greater stats, greater resists, etc.<br />
<br />
There may be something that I am missing, but that would lead me to believe that there will be many classes who do not have weapons in Anguish outside of their epic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yup, when 1 handers started having the same ac/hp as 2Handers.<br />
And ending up with superior DPS it was a sign.<br />
<br />
Still i miss the era after the 2H revamp, when you really had a choice.<br />
And the stat gap wasnt abysmal (dunno about the DPS par for non warriors).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">arlakisd</div><div class="date">01-20-2005, 08:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree. I miss the days when 2HB was an option. <br />
In velious it was a nice option..<br />
Imbued Fighters staff (Kunark) <br />
Facesmasher was fun.<br />
Then I got REBB + Caen's.<br />
Then SoT..<br />
My next 2HX will be the Bonestaff of wickedness.<br />
Will be nice for 2boxing but that's about all I see it good for. Or farming easy mobs and looking at 3k crits. (In Disc)<br />
The Stat gap now is almost 2 to 1 in favor of 1HX. Almost.. I can get 640 HP easy of 2 1HX. (Assuming I can just have any weapon in the game.) At best so far I can get 380 from 2HX. <br />
It doesn't take a genius to see that 2HX is at a disadvantage. Then with DPS going in favor of 1HX well.. For any real fighting.. I'm going 1HX unless something changes, which I doubt they will do they went to too much effort to make 2HX the least desireable option. And with offhand Riposte immunity they halved the disadvantage of using 1HX.</div></div><hr />

I wouldn't say that's OUR weapon, but it is definitely a good one.  Low AC and I would rather have Anger as the proc.  Still very nice none the less.</div></div><hr />

I like this weapon. True, there is only 20 AC, but with epic 2.0 or Shield in offhand, there isn't much to complain about.<br />
<br />
This has a very respectable ratio, over 300hp, and a proc that is 2nd to only Anger in hate. (It is more hate than A3 aug and most likely equal to enraging blow).<br />
<br />
It is not war only, but a reasonable upgrade compared to Thunderclap and Allin's mace in OoW, which is what I was hoping to see.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And, if you haven't noticed, the Beastlord weapon from Hanvar has a worse ratio than the Fangs of the Serpent, which are MNK/BST.  Not alot of thought was put into Anguish weapon itemization, obviously.  The SK weapon was likewise not originally an upgrade, and had to be modified.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rueeliar</div><div class="date">01-25-2005, 11:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, Gelid Claw is a horrible proc.  It is 300 damage, which is now considered 'good,' when it would have been considered 'awesome' in PoP.  That's the bonus.  The downside is that it contains a debuff component, which will prevent it from being able to crit blast at all, locking its damage output into exactly the listed damage multiplied by ppm, factoring in resists.<br />
<br />
A proc that does 250 points of damage has the potential to do about the same amount of damage with resists factored in.  Still comparing the Fangs of the Serpent, most classes prefer lifetap procs whenever possible to cut into AE damage, AE rampage, or even straight melee damage while tanking, especially classes that have healing AA that will kick in on the heal component of the lifetap proc.<br />
<br />
Still, in the end, the BST weapon simply doesn't add up.  It would be like finding Crystallia in Anguish with a WAR-only tag and 400 hp and comparing it to MSC.  The damage is less, the proc, while more damage, is not nearly as desired, adding up to a weapon that cannot be anything more than sub-par.</div></div><hr />
