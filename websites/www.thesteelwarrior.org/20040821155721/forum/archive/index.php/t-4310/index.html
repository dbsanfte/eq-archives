<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>PetreEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Did you not post here after seeing my first post in the other thread? :) Mine was locked too so dont feel bad. But was unlocked because it's a different thread. Nonetheless I saw it posted nowhere before my first post. No big deal either way. I just wanted people to see it had they not seen it yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>PetreEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">er I should say mine linked to a different URL.</div></div><hr />

I guess the Shik is showing his might as mod. :)<br />

EDIT: taking =! taken</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>PetreEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Honestly, I would not have posted it had I seen it. :)  I've never been able to get to the front page before. Always got access denied. It was recommended that I repost it here so that it would be seen. So I did. Along with everyone else hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>PetreEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">lol Raaj</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>PetreEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I  missed Shik's post. No offense taken here :)<br />
And I missed Krowbar's post and thought Thaak was talking to me. Boy I'm rusty and need to make better use of the Quote button :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">The goal is to make melee combat more interesting over all, to introduce a little more skill into the way a melee character is played,<br />
How do you add more skill and cope with the existance of lag at the same time. We're not talking Soul Caliber here.<br />
<br />
My guess is that at best mini-disciplines will be created with some kind of pseudo-mana bar, spell gems, and perhaps buff indicators. It's obvious and easy to impliment.<br />
<br />
Likely we'll get a book to put our stickers in as we earn them. IF they are worried about making Warriors too powerful (wink) it will include the current activated disciplines. Using one will gray out the rest until the refresh period is over.<br />
<br />
On a positive note, this is very spell-like and they have shown some ability to create and change spells.<br />
<br />
 and to achieve the balance that we are always looking for<br />
And there's the kicker. We are told &quot;more&quot; three times - he's trying real hard to convince us that we're getting even &quot;more&quot; for our monthly fee.<br />
<br />
Last on the list appears balance. This is not a responce to our balance concerns. Warriors aren't being balanced, they are being re-invented.<br />
<br />
I believe we are about to become hybrids without spellbooks and no longer The Tank.<br />
<br />
This could be good or it could suck horribly. Given what they did with the pocket dungeon concept, I don't have a lot of confidence.<br />
<br />
Oh, thanks to the totally egregious, barely matters anywhere else in the game use of Fear in PoTime, I've gotten the fear resist disciplines. So now I'm -<br />

Go bible binary?  <br />

Try Warrior Shifting Gears Handbook :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">they are gona make it like EQ:AO and EQ2 and WoW, everquest has become the test sever for ideas for EQ2, just yesterday i was compairing our upcoming spell effects from test server, and the screenshots from eq2..... guess what? they look fairly close.<br />
<br />
new graphic engine that stands alone and you can use a &quot;spread sheet&quot; to update graphics (like trees, grass, wood, all at once) sounds like EQ2 but it will run on mine</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I think they spent 8 of these 9months trying to find a way to upgrade melees... maybe thinking up new discs or whatever...<br />
then the last month they realised it was useless.. Melee design had driven itself into a deadend, and there was no way out.<br />
They had to find a new design (a new design that already exists on every other game).<br />
<br />
I really do hope that disciplines become a big part of it, they tweek all current ones, add in a bunch of new ones, and recreate the whole discipline system.. along with a few nifty abilities!<br />
Can't wait :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Anyone look at the Fire's of Heaven front page lately? http://fohguild.org/</div></div><hr />

And why are they doing it around a holiday, when most people are probably going to be with family out of town and not near a computer?  Not to go conspirecy theory here, but damn son...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Man... SOE writers are probably crying, when looking that story up.<br />
Very nice Furor, and nice update on Wow too.<br />
fuck..<br />
now I'm leaning towards the Warrior class in WoW :/... and I was planning of never touching this class.. ever.. again.<br />
<br />
And that idea of having a &quot;mana&quot; bar that builds up during fights....<br />
my god... help! im falling in love... with a game! :eek:</div></div><hr />
