<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tunai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey Guyz, my friend is gonna be giving me 200k, since he is gonna quit EQ, and I was thinking, what is the best equipment that you guyz think I should get with the 200k? I was thinking for my weapons, they should be a Split Blade of Destruction, and a CHoS. I'm a 46 Ogre Warrior...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">&lt;voices chanting in unison&gt;...<br />
<br />
Droga weapons, fierce heraldic...yeah, heard that somewhere I think....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mourneblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm pretty new to the warrior class, so don't take my advice as gospel.<br />
<br />
Here is a link to what I currently have: Rize's Magelo (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=979831) <br />
<br />
With this gear at level 57 I have roughly 6500hp and 1300ac raidbuffed (Brells, PoT9, Kazaad and Fo7)<br />
<br />
Minus the Fabled BP and the Sting of Betrayal you have a good idea of what 200kpp will buy...  Now I don't like to advertise that this is a twink, as I farmed most of these items with my Enchanter and/or guild events... but I did dump quite a bit of plat into him.<br />
<br />
For the mainhand/offhand combo I don't feel it's necessary to have 2 proc weapons until you begin taking on larger mobs post 55ish.  I would recommend Copper Hammer of Striking in mainhand, and Sword of the Bloodsworn in the offhand.  I have ZERO problems maintaining aggro with that combo, and the encite line of discs.<br />
<br />
Fierce heraldic items are great AC/HP boosters until you can move into no-drop or LDoN upgrades.  Just take a look at the magelo listed above and hopefully you'll have a good idea of where you could stand.  I think at 46 I had roughly 5700hp buffed... which isn't bad. <br />
<br />
Good luck on your warrior.  I really enjoy mine.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tunai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Um... Just 1 question guyz... What are Droga weapons?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vamcoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Copper hammer of striking and Sword of the bloodsworn go go droga weapons. Stay away from the SBoD if for no other reason then its to pricey</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Slinki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I have to agree with the last post.  The SBoD is really for looks.  I am 54 and starting to have problems holding agro in LDoN and some regular groups.  Over nukeing casters, rangers with death wish, and Paly that chain cast stun for some reason.  I use the Droga weapons and have problems holding agro.  So been working on getting Anger II aug. <br />
<br />
FH armor is the best no drop armor for the pp.  Wish i could ware HEHE.. Not sure what lvl you can quest for ornate but with that pp you can get most ornate if you watch for sells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Quincent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Fierce heraldic set goes a long way. As well as the droga set-up.<br />
<br />
If you like to 2-box, get the ornate gloves. If not, then dont.<br />
<br />
Dont waste the pp on the SBoD, that will blow about 7 or 8 items by itself.<br />
<br />
Get a soulscream belt, bloodmetal earrings, and valorium rings (or, if ya can budget it, get maybe 1 steel ring of earthen resiliance [sp?] but that will blow a lot of cash as well). a decent bow too, I use a nightmarewood atm til i can afford a stonewood.<br />
<br />
That's just what i am mostly using. Gluck ;)<br />
<br />
EDIT: BTW, if you do happen to get Ornate armor.. you will not be able to start the quest (talk to the dorf in PoTranq) til you are level 55.. so, wait on buying any ornate til then ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kiya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If your ogre worships a diety, get the cultural armor.  Otherwise, you'll have to deal like the rest of us non RZ folks.  Pick up a sword of the bloodsworn, a copper hammer of stricking and find a Greatstaff of Thunder on the cheap for when you hit 55.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nazgrub</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Aye, Droga weapons + Fierce Heraldic = Teh Win!!<br />
 <br />
Just remember that CHoS will not do much for your aggro until 50 (which you're pretty close to).  SotBS is better until then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tunai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well... Aight guyz... Thnx for all of the help. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tribute</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I gag when I see warriors with the SotBS.  It looks like a toy that should be in a bard's bag.  The graphic is just too flashy for my tastes and personally wouldn't equip one in a well lighted room.  I would love to hear some original suggestions for aggro weps.  I really really don't like the cookie cutter tank look.  I think the Frostbringer / Snowchipper  at least looks better than the Droga combo.  That may be just b/c i'm a Velious baby tho  :rolleyes: .  Other weps to consider; Snowchipper, Frosty, Blade of Insanity, Wavecrasher, Fleshgrinder,  Spiked Velium Mallet, Wind-Worn Handblade.  The mace in my profile is one-groupable if you got some 60+ friends/guildmates.  There are some other easily attainable NO DROP weps out there but none come to mind atm.  Dats my 2 cents.<br />
<br />
Offtopic: Does anyone know the minimum level for the Strength of Elements turn-in?  I tried to get the container at 36 but the NPC responded with something like &quot;You must do more adventuring&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Vamcoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I love people who talk about the cookie cutter and how much warriors with it suck. The reason people say get a SotBS is becuse its hands down one of the best aggro weapons thats not nodrop. So what if its &quot;cookie cutter&quot; it works get off you soap box and become a tank.<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: spelling</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tunai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Well... Why is a SBoD not a good weapon for me to get? All my friends in-game say that it is an amazing weapon for keeping aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Daabu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">It costs too much.  You can get just as good and spend thousands of platinum less<br />
<br />
Sword of the Bloodsworn and Copper Hammer of Striking TOGETHER cost about the same as a Split Blade of Destruction.  Save your money and spend it on something better</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Tunai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">You sure about that? On my server SBoD costs around 70-80k and CHoS is 12k and SotBS is 10k lol...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Whoever says SBoD is an amazing weapon for keeping aggro has no personal experience with it.  It is not good aggro at all.  It is good DPS.  Good DPS will not prevent the mob from turning the wizard into paste.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Tunai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Aight then... What other weapons can I buy that are in my price range other than CHoS, and SotBS?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Aight then... What other weapons can I buy that are in my price range other than CHoS, and SotBS?<br />
<br />
Hmm...I'm confused.  That's the best non-droppable agro combo you can get and it's relatively cheap.  So...why get anything else?  (unless you're 55...then the GSoT is about equal agro and it goes for about 100 plat on Emarr these days)<br />
<br />
I'm just trying to figure out what your weapon goal is if it isn't agro...then I can make recommendations.  (although, all I care about is agro, so I may not be the best to advise on looks or dps weapons  ;) )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Tunai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Ok, then here goes... I'll get the CHoS, and SoBS for aggro. Then what is a nice DPS combo?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Until you reach your mid 50's, those weapons are probably your best bet for a DPS setup too.  By your mid 50's, your 2 hander damage bonus will have become substantial, so focus on 2 handers for DPS.  The War Marshall's Bladed Staff is recommended level 56 and is probably your best choice for DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Mourneblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Unfortunately, I became a fabled farmer when the 5 year celebrations were taking place.... I got a Fabled Exe Axe and love it.<br />
<br />
I've read several posts stating that slower 2h parse better than the faster 2h but I have yet to prove this.  Using my own parser, I see a slight advantage to the Fabled Exe Axe over the Axe of the Kromzek Kings but nothing to write home about.<br />
<br />
I am not a huge fan on massive DPS from a MA or SA.  It's not your job to outdamage the 400aa crit happy wizzies you'll be seeing a few months from now.  It's your job to keep that mob looking at you instead of noticing the 6k crits bouncing off of his forehead. <br />
<br />
That's why the folks in here are discussing aggro weapons of choice, vs. hugely modified uber DPS weapons.  Read the posts on DPS and Aggro.  It opened my eyes to the whole world of tanking.  After you read it, you'll realize why there are those tanks that can't hold aggro, and those that you can't peel a mob off of them if you tried.  Aggro is king.<br />
<br />
Tanks aren't Glory Whores... at least they shouldn't be.  Leave that to the casters.<br />
<br />
As for when you are just added DPS, the WBS is a very good choice...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I agree with the weapons/armor suggestions.<br />
The other critical item is haste. Since you have the funds, I'd look for at least 31% haste, though 36% would be better. You can't max your haste with 31% items, but it'll be very close and for a while you won't be maxxed anyway because you won't have top haste buffs. So, 31% would be cheaper and do you for many levels, and once you wanted to upgrade, you can always sell 31% haste.</div></div><hr />
