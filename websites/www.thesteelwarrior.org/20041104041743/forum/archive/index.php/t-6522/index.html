<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Glachum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Looking for a while at what I can upgrade and how.  It seems that the bazaar has run dry for me but if I'm wrong, tell me.  I have 2 vallorium rings of gallantry coming to me soon, and I'm tryin my damnest to get some friends together and cash in some favors for a vindi BP.    Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">CHoS for mainhand.  For most visible slots either LDoN armor or Ornate.  Really depends on what force you can scrape together to go get stuff or how much cash you have to spend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gasmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">First thing I would do is get a CHoS om your primary slot, if you have friends willing to help you, go camp one. Second that earring needs to go, when i see a magelo or inspect someone and see that graphic, it makes me cringe in horror. Depending on how much your looking to spend, I'd go with Mosquito Leg Earring or Bloodmetal Earring of Engagement. Anything else I would just upgrade when possible, but those 2 items I would highly recommend replacing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Timrum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Copper Hammer of Striking<br />
Bloodmetal Earring of Engagement<br />
Amulett of mummy warppings<br />
Kizraks for Hand slot if you can pay it, if not also Blood Runed Gauntlets would be a small upgrade.<br />
Kylong Darkmail for face <br />
Fine Heraldic Bracer for Bone bracelet</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Argin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Actually I'm not sure what you mean by the &quot;bazaar has run dry,&quot; from what I can tell even with 2 vallorium rings every slot in your profile can be upgraded by bazaar items, even if though some will start to get pricey.   For the mask if you can get friends to kill Vindi you can probably go camp an Amygadlan mask in CT yourself, as long as you can break camp up to temple the camp itself if pretty easy.  You could find several better haste items, and myrmidon armor isnt that hard to replace by a combination of ornate and ldon hard drops.  Are you looking in a certain cash range?   Thats the only way i can think that you've run out of tradeable upgrades.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Glachum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">s'pose I should have mentioned that yeah, cashflow would be limited.  I'm at about 25k.  So that being said, while yeah the bazaar has a few things that I could upgrade, it's run dry in my pricerange.  =/  Also I'm an agnostic warrior so no diety specific, I'll check out the fine heraldic stuff though.  thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Roughbeard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Your Necklace --&gt; Amulet of Mummy Wrappings or Clattering Bone Necklace<br />
<br />
Champ Gaunts --&gt; SS Gaunts<br />
<br />
Vah Shir Earring --&gt; Mosquito Leg or Bloodmetal Earring (or at least something with Raw Hps ex. Electrum Black Sapphire Earring)<br />
<br />
MESS --&gt; CHoS, Frostbringer (if your on a budget), Camp Fabled Yak.. something with a decent Proc<br />
<br />
Bracer of Fortitude --&gt; Bracer of Benevolence (Quest in WW) Sta has diminishing returns the further you go and there is no benefit to Having that much Sta gear if you cap Sta with Buffs anyways.. you are getting 16 Sta from the 2 Valorium Rings so you can afford to lose some in other spots<br />
<br />
Idol of the Thorned --&gt; Darkwood Bow of Suffering.. No Changing Range for Pulling, still a slight upgrade at the same time. <br />
