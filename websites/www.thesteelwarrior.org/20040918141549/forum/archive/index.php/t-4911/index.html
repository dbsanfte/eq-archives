<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ceris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Four hours in Ssra.  Five shards.  Two strange green metal.  Me and a friend both happy with shiny new corrupted shissar weapons, which have decent stats and should do nicely against every snake in Ssra.<br />
<br />
Versus:<br />
<br />
Twelve hours farming ancient shriekers.<br />
<br />
Eight Saps.<br />
<br />
Six Tempers from those. (250 brewer)<br />
<br />
FIVE tempers used to make ONE Yttrium sheet. (250 smith)<br />
<br />
ONE Yttrium War Axe.  No stats, and useful against only one mob.  Only reason I kept at it is that I'm a stubborn bastard.<br />
<br />
I know this isn't particularly insightful, and I know I'm far from the first to make this observation, but Seru bane is a royal pain in the ass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">&quot;but Seru bane is a royal pain in the ass.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eh, wizards kill Seru. Us melees kill the adds.<br />
<br />
:P<br />
<br />
And tanks can incite and berate him all they want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bonequest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have two seru bane weapons, I really wish they worked on the other mobs in the zone so I could use them to farm plat solo.  Unfortunately they just seem to hit normal on all mobs that are not Seru.  If I had extra LDoN points running out of a faucet I would aug them both with anger3 hehe but that would be a huge waste as they are not really necessary to tank him.  EB weps work fine since agro goes by potential not actual damage on him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>FulorianC</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The thing is... Serubane is about the same as Cursedbane, if there was such thing. Even if melee's had, you wouldn't want them to engage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">melees engaging cursed is perfectly fine as long as you know how to neutralize the AE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dubb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">We've always engaged Cursed with melee. Same with Seru... without bane too, anything to speed up a tedious 20-man kill. Personally, I equip AHB primary (as a rogue) and keep scoriae bite poison up.<br />
<br />
I realize this is the outhouse, so here's a useful holiday tip:  learn to fucking count and make a hotkey. It ain't rocket science.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Khumak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">We never bothered with Emp bane.  We just used casters to burn him down.  No reason you can't do the same with Seru.  Both can be killed with zero bane weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Weapon bane was stupid.  As long as casters can dish damage without &quot;spell bane&quot; then camping/farming out weapon bane for a guild is a waste of time.  Only a few need bane weapondry while the casters blast away.<br />
<br />
In short, weapon bane is stupid in the absence of spell bane.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I like the IDEA of weapon bane.<br />
<br />
I just think they implemented it totally wrong.<br />
<br />
What they SHOULD have done is something far more akin to Gnollslayer, but on a bigger scale.<br />
<br />
There should have been an Orcbane weapon quest series. So that players could acquire anti-orc weaponry from their newbie levels all the way up to their 50s.<br />
<br />
Along with Giant-bane.<br />
<br />
And of course DRAGON-bane.<br />
<br />
That's much more in line with the fantasy aspect, quest aspect of everquest. You quest to get the weapon that will put the smack down on the big bad dragon.<br />
<br />
They sort of offered this with the vampyre bane weapons.<br />
<br />
But Shissar bane being required, Seru bane being required ... it was just a &quot;gimmick&quot; to make completing that part of the game take longer.<br />
<br />
Effective to a degree, since it is a pretty well implemented &quot;time sink&quot; ... I mean hell Seru bane is still completely annoying, and completely a waste of time.<br />
<br />
But it saddened me that they didn't go in the other direction. The stories involving orcs, dragons and giants can be soooooooooooo interesting. Having bane weapons for their ilk would have been much more popular a series of quests than &quot;Greater Akheva Bane.&quot;<br />
<br />
I mean, greater akheva bane? Who freakin cares? Zek bane? Not worth the time.<br />
<br />
But how cool would it have been to have a quest available to you, that was involved, but FUN, that allowed you to get a Dragonslayer weapon, with Dragon Bane, so that you could go into the Temple of Veeshan (whether for your FIRST time or just to re-live some old memories) and WHAM, hit them up with a weapon designed to kick their ass?<br />
<br />
Dev team dropped the ball on that one, imo.<br />
<br />
That gnoll bane exists and orc bane doesn't underscores exactly how half-assed the bane weapon idea was implemented.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bonequest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I agree.  I always wished my axe of the kromzek kings had dragon bane.  Seems like Sony missed something pretty obvious on that one for sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">i agree with wubau......WTF did i just say that?  :D</div></div><hr />
