<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaago</div><div class="date">04-20-2003, 07:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, our 3 highest warriors were sharing a Black Acrylia Halberd for a month.  One of them bought his own, one got a Tae Ew Two Handed Sword, and the other guy finally got to keep his.  So I would guess that its better.<br />
All 3 are very good at keeping agro, my monk only got hit 3 times during a raid one night with them doing the tanking while using his BAH.  And those 3 hits came from the first Enrage.  They told me that that meant the mob was going to Riposte every hit and to turn attack off until he went out of Enrage.<br />
As soon as I save up the plat  or get the materials to make one, I'll be getting one too.<br />
