My FPS skills have atrophied though. Last time I got on UT, it was just sad. I'm all about instagib team deathmatch. Running around blowing people to smithereens (sp?) is a wonderful contrast to the humdrum of EQ. (err at least it is when I CAN'T get on EQ heh)</div></div><hr />

I would always get like 13-15 hit combo on my friends because they tried to play it like Street Fighter II ^^</div></div><hr />

PS makes EQ look well programmed and efficient. My system cries mommy after a couple hours due to lag/memory leak. The maturity level of PS makes the Zek servers appear tame. People gloat more than I have ever seen.<br />
<br />
It is a fun game though, similar to any FPS game. I enjoy sniping from hills, or jumping in a wall turret because they have heavy armor and endless ammo. Fun stuff. I will have to upgrade my vid card and add another stick of 512 if I decide to keep playing, though. =/</div></div><hr />

I dusted off my Sega Saturn and started playing Dragon Force, Panzer Dragoon Saga, Darius Gaiden (love 2D shooters) and a few of the Capcom 2D fighters like Marvel Super Heroes, Darkstalkers 2 and X-Men:  Children of the Atom.<br />

Not too hard once you got down the fireballs and basic combos. Especially easy if you use weak attacks to start the chain.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm shaft, if you start playing  :D  I'ma have to take a look at that ... I tried it once, one of the early versions, and was hopeless.  It looks like they've really got the mod singing now, tho.  I first tripped over reference to the Thievery mod on a System Shock forum iirc.  You may get a kick out of http://www.planetunreal.com/UCZ/ - another good re-invention of UT that has kept quietly improving while I was looking the other way.<br />

I started playing somewhere around version 0.80, &amp; finished around 1.20.  I tried it again a while ago, but the gameplay was even flatter than I had remembered it :p.</div></div><hr />
