<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>oaklenia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all, first post here and i gotta say I love trolling the warrior boards when i'm not on the wizzy ones. Anyways, I'm starting a warrior and was looking for some suggestions as to good mid-high level equipment that could be soloed with a 65 wizard. <br />
<br />
I have access to a 65 ranger that could duo an encounter with me if need be. Anything, literally, would be most helpful. Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Smakz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">if your starting one, and starting from scratch, my advice is dont twink too harshly at first.<br />
<br />
you will need to visit a few zones, not many, but a few.  Guk, Velks, Crystal Caverns, Eastern Wastes, Cobalt Scar.  <br />
<br />
Step-1 Quad otters in CS for Crusty armor.<br />
Step-2 Head to Eastern Wastes, kill rygorr orcs for Orc fang earrings<br />
Step-3 Zone to Crystal Caverns Named by the tentacles drops chipped velium amulet for your neck slot.<br />
Step-4 Head to Lower Guk, Dead side.  Take out the Ghoul Lord a few times. Pick up a SSoY, and a Skull Shaped Barbute (helm)<br />
Step-5 Frenzied Ghoul in Guk for an FBSS<br />
Step-6 Executioner in Guk for Executioner's Axe<br />
Step-7 Velks Frenzy camp (or ledge dependant on server) for Silver Chitin Wristband x2, possibly Silver Chitin Handwraps (if your lucky, then you wont need the FBSS), Crystaline Spider Fang, and Venomous Axe of the Velium Brood<br />
Step-8 Crystal Eyes in Velks for Crystal Spider Eye for mask<br />
Step-9 you will need to buy a few items,  Velium Fire Wedding ring x2<br />
Step-10 Maiden's Eye, Quad Apes for Goranga Club, and Goranga Idol.<br />
<br />
Its not top end by far.  But it will get you easily into your 40s.<br />
When you hit 45, look into Cultural Armors.<br />
<br />
Twinking light at the beginning gives a better chance for skill ups than if you went heavy.  And all of that stuff is soloable by a 65 warrior, so a 65 wiz + 65 ranger should have no probs at all with any of it.<br />
<br />
the path i posted is very much soloable by a 65 wiz, with the possible exception of the Velks camps.  Everything else i could easily do with a 60 wiz.  <br />
<br />
Your next step in gear after that would most likely be to look into Cultural, or Velious MQs.<br />
<br />
Basically, when looking for gear for a warrior, go for Raw HP, Then AC, then Stamina in that order of importance.<br />
<br />
at the low end, with the gear i posted, you will be very formidable, and wont have any problems.  You wont need to upgrade till well into your 40s, early 50s.  But of course, you will.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Slav</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I am in a similiar situation on regearing after a rotted corpse.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Step-6 Executioner in Guk for Executioner's Axe<br />
I hope this is a joke,,,,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Khiloor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">ahhahaa. i was thinking the same thing. then i scrolled down a bit and someone else said it first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tugurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Crustacean armor? SSoY? SSB? Exe axe?<br />
<br />
I would think a 65 wizard could do better than any of that. Heck, 1k in the bazaar buys a full set of crustacean -- why bother camping otters?<br />
<br />
Camp in UP, get raldukan or moktor armor. Camp in ME, get the belt, the hammer, and the axe. Get a friend or two and go to Droga, camp king and seer. Gather components for cultural combines.</div></div><hr />
