<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Timothian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all, lots and  lots of good information on agro weapons, and agro setup.  I am wondering what weapon I should be aiming for when I am in DPS mode (out of tank rotation,, soloing, etc..)  My magelo is almost up to date and should show my aggro weapons.  For DPS I currently use a &quot;Double Edged Ga Nak&quot; it has 48 damage, and 45 delay, poor stats, but if I am out of the tank rotation, do not care about too much about poor stats, soloing, I do care about stats.  I am not elemental flagged, and do not have any flags for GoD zones<br />
<br />
1.  Are there any good 1-2 groupable dps weapons I should be trying for?  I am very  interested in OOW, there have been some nice weapons.<br />
<br />
2.  I have not pursued many AAs that increas my DPS.  After I do the general DPS AAs (off in the future, not done wiht defensive AAs), should I pursue a track of doing AAs that help 1H, or 2H?<br />
<br />
3.  Plat is not an issue for me, and have been quite succesful in bazaar, but have not been impressed with 2hs weapons available.<br />
<br />
The vast majority of my time is spent in Xp groups where I am MA.  A small amount of time I spen in xp groups where I am SA, or in open raids.  Guild raiding is now almost non existant, but if it does raid, I am MA.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nazgrub</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Edge of Envelopment (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=70228) is pretty good I'd say, not sure where to get it though.  Is in the Vazaelle bazaar right now for 180k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Frostpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'd probably grab a velium gemmed 2hander out of bazaar and call it good. GSo4W better dps, and free if you're into taking down Auliffe in BoT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sirphoenix_18</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Anyone mind linking the stats from the Edge?  I'm at work and almost all EQ sites are blocked out.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />

I'd probably use it over GSo4W just for the nicer stats; the dps gained or lost between the two is minimal</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sirphoenix_18</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ah yes, I remember seeing one of those drop in the southern part of WoS from one of the named that wanders around there.  It seems to be the rare because out of the 15+ named I have killed down there I have only seen one of them drop.  Very nice DPS weapon though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Timothian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks all.  I like EoE that was listed above.  It is currently in my bazaar for 100k.  It has damage of 44, delay 34, AC 20, HP 135, 100 pnt Direct Damage process, +12 to most resists, and some decent stats.  Think I will continue to camp out in WoS and hope one drops.<br />

(Edit, duh, the stats are listed above, I should read a little closer)</div></div><hr />
