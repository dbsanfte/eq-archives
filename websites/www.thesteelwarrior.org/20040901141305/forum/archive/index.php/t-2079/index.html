<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Seems to me that one of the biggest issues with higher end gear in EQ is the proliferation of all/all, or all plate/all equipment that's 'the best' in certain equipment slots for multiple classes, particularly because oftentimes it has greater rewards for mana using classes because of + mana based stats on it, as well as melee based stats.<br />
<br />
I think it would be a good idea to have gear which dropped which has + melee stats but negative casting stats.  Things like focus effects which are NOT positive, which cause you to expend more mana per spell, or have longer casting time, or increased fizzle rates or muiltply reagent costs, or even a negative mana regen.   This would easily allow for there to be the ABILITY to equip such items, yet a drawback for doing so and pumping up one set of stats at a time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This was on the Druid's Board also...<br />
A fairly good idea, but the casters would go fucking insane! I mean, WHY should they be penalized to CAST SPELLS?! :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">edit:<br />
<br />
After reading my post I realized I was just repeating Frodlin's thoughts.<br />
<br />
I'll just suffice in saying I agree whole-heartedly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I can see no problem at all with this idea, other than it would require a bit more originality from the people designing new gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I agree, if knights want to close the gap on melee stats, then it makes sense that they shouldn't also get great caster benefits.  If they want caster benefits, they should have items available to them that give good benefits there, but lesser melee stats.  Thereby having an actual penalty for getting there spell books (since the current penalty is too small).<br />
<br />
Nice thoughts Frod</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Garoar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">A fairly good idea, but the casters would go fucking insane! I mean, WHY should they be penalized to CAST SPELLS?!  <br />
<br />
Same reason were penalized for NOT having mana or casting spells, we have to fight for gear with mana and +WIS and +INT against other plate wearers, the itemization is so dam out of wack its sick. <br />
No other class should be able to wear our armor (at the high end) and making plate armor negative to other plate wearers would prove that, either that or give us some benefit for having mana gear turn it into AC or HPs or something, its completely screwed that theres more benefits for a Pally or SK or CLR or Bard to wear an awesome Item than a Warrior.<br />
What keeps us from wearing gear tuned to a Pal , SK, CLR, or Bard ? they generally have less HP and AC, but they have made it so armor we wear also fits the other classes in essence putting the screws to the Warrior by giving ALL other classes besides Warriors a second option /FU SoE. I can't wait for WoW to go Beta.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>landrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It is very ammusing, in a ironic way, that the class usually deemed most overall equipment dependant, is the class least thought of when new equipment is created...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tugurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think the warrior taunt fix is in effect, with readily dropping, tradeable weapons with solid aggro procs falling in Droga. Between the Sword of the Bloodsworn and the Copper Hammer of Striking, I think SoE figures they're getting weapons into the hands of low-mid tier warriors. Both mobs are very easily one groupable (or less), and new Droga is combination of not all that difficult and fairly rewarding. I picked up a Sword of the Bloodsworn yesterday, and used it mostly successfully in HoH last night. I ditched my recently purchased GSOT to use bloodsworn + red epic, and it seemed like I was able to get aggro better than I have in a while.<br />
<br />
This isn't the balancing strategy I would have chosen, but I guess it's something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">negative stats I would understand.<br />
<br />
But putting in focus effects that would penalise the caster would have the same result as removing that caster type on the item altogether.<br />
<br />
Although it would seem nice to have cursed items ingame,<br />
EverQuest has become too old for such things imo.<br />
<br />
If an item is cursed, people will just ignore it all together.<br />
<br />
Much easier, and much more effective to just remove the caster's ability to use the item...<br />
but much less attractive.<br />
<br />
That's the problem, EverQuest is no longer a attractive game, it's a competitive game.<br />
You aim for the best gear, the maximum hp/mana etc... and the cursed items are just brushed over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If an item is cursed, people will just ignore it all together.<br />
<br />
wrong casters will ignore it or pal/sk this giving it practically automatically give it to us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zukobim AB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">negative stats I would understand.<br />
<br />
But putting in focus effects that would penalise the caster would have the same result as removing that caster type on the item altogether.<br />
<br />
You can design it so only parts of the caster skills are affected, like<br />
- 50% more mana use on spells based on certain magic skills, ie. abjuration, conjuration and so on.<br />
- mana usage is increased in percent equal to the difference between spell level and caster level.<br />
- Some magic skills go up and others go down<br />
- mana pool is lowered but mana regen is increased<br />
- mana regen is lowered but mana pool is increased<br />
- melee focus effects, like 10% to piercing, but 5 lower mana regen.<br />
<br />
This is just some of the many ways possible to add cursed effects.<br />
<br />
Still the best curse is Class: WAR :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>landrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">'cursed' gear would be cool. <br />
<br />
BUT, the problem is that there is so much gear that has no drawbacks that people will not use the cursed stuff. A FT3 head from UP comes to mind.. it has negatives but people will still use it..<br />
<br />
Make a FT 10 ring with -10 all stats/saves and -150 hps +150 mana.. <br />
<br />
wonder how many would refuse to use it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Not sure on the FT 10 ring...a LOT of people have hit the FT cap, and it's not too hard to hit really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Khumak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">What I'd like to see happen is to have them assign AC/HP/mana like the already do but that's just the base for the item.  When a specific class puts it on that gets modified based on their class.  So a 35AC 125hp/mana necklace on me is a 50AC 175hp 0mana necklace, but on a knight it's a 42AC 140HP 100mana necklace, and on a wizard it's a 20AC 100HP 175mana necklace.<br />
<br />
They could do the same thing with focus effects.  Assign focus effects to some sort of category.  Instead of assigning a specific effect to the item, assign it something like category 3 level 4.  So instead of assigning it mana preservation 4 it's category 3 level 4, on the casters it's mana preservation 4, on a knight it's mana preservation 2 shielding 2, on a pure melee it's shielding 4.  Instead of Flowing Thought 2 you make it category 1 level 2 and on a melee it becomes aura of battle.<br />
<br />
That would allow them to make items that everyone wants that are tailored to every class that can wear it without being overpowered or underpowered for any of the pure classes or hybrids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">So you want VI to add focuses to items currently in game, <br />
that would give a bit of a bonus, but a bit of a curse as well?<br />
<br />
This was about having Warrior get a certain bonus of all/all items, over other classes.<br />
Giving Warriors a bonus, or simply removing the other classes on the item seems the simplest and fairest way.<br />
<br />
Adding focus that would make casters hesitate, would still fuck the warriors over.<br />
We still get Nothing more...<br />
<br />
Melee focus additions would be a nice way for example....<br />
<br />
<br />
Why concentrate on giving casters BAD focus?...<br />
when we could get Warriors, Rogues, Monk GOOD focuses?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Daddio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">This Think it would be a good idea to have gear which dropped which has + melee stats but negative casting stats.

<br />
This isn't exactly fair, since warriors can equip items with 200+ mana with no drawback to our current effectiveness. So what would be the point of using this instead of class restriction? Since somebody is obviously not going to buy an item that hinders their charecter.<br />
<br />
My charecter has somewhere along the lines of 1000 mana from his equipment, should he be penalized for items that are so obviously meant for casters, as casters are penalized for items that are so obviously meant for melee?<br />
<br />
The simple aswer is that all/all items never rot, which is good. The downside is that it creates a lot more competition for loot. In a raiding guild however, I'd much rather get 2 items that all the classes can use, than 2 items that 2 classes on the raid can use.<br />
<br />
The fact is, we don't need any new script to determine who should loot the item, class restrictions work just fine. Whether we need more class restricted items is debatable, but I don't really want to see tons of loot rotting cause nobody needs it, we get enough of that as is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>scrab1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">One of the funnier items available to someone at my level of the game:<br />
<br />
Mantle of the Rainmaker<br />
MAGIC ITEM  LORE ITEM  NO DROP  <br />
Slot: SHOULDERS<br />
AC: 18<br />
STR: +13  STA: +11  WIS: +12  INT: +12  HP: +100  MANA: +100  SV FIRE: +15  SV COLD: +15  <br />

WT: 1.0  Size: MEDIUM<br />
Class: PAL RNG SHD BRD BST    &lt;== hmm, whats missing?<br />
Race: ALL<br />
<br />
<br />
Guess i'll stick with strength of the elements then.  kk thx la~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Eradani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">the Hybrid / all flag isnt all to uncommon either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">actually I think what we are going to see in next expansion is loot along the lines of the new flag charm. IE each item is personalized for the class wearing it. I really hope thats what we are going to see since that would finally stop fucking pure mele in the ass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I hope you're right Casai. I'd also like to see something like Khumak's idea implemented, if we are the &quot;masters of melee combat&quot;  it would make sense for a piece of armor to be better when we're wearing it because we should know how to make the most of it since it's all we have.  Then the plate/all tag wouldnt be quite as insulting as it is now, since the same item on us would still be more effective than it would be on a pal/sk.<br />
<br />
Oh, and if they really want to balance things they could put those new aggro weapons that drop in droga on a vendor in shadowhaven, right next to the guy that sells cease and desist. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Oh, and if they really want to balance things they could put those new aggro weapons that drop in droga on a vendor in shadowhaven, right next to the guy that sells cease and desist.  <br />
<br />
Sorta like they did with the cleric hammer? There is precedence for such actions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">The fact that people are talking about negqtive stats as a &quot;penalty&quot; is absurd and asinine.   <br />
<br />
Daddio, let me explain.   Mr. Paladin over here snags himself a Flowing Moss Mantle.    He receives the *exact* same benefit as me PLUS a big mana bonus as well.   The item is 110% more of an increae to him as it is to me.   Now, let's say that he really needed somthing which gave him haste and a nice Stamina/hp upgrade, and it had a focus effect which was negative which gave a cost of an extra 20 mana per cast of a detrimental spell.   It would still benefit his melee abilities EXACTLY the same as it does me, and he'd still get a bigger mana pool advantage, but there would be a cost associated with it.  It would essentially make him choose one thing over another, decide which is more important to him.   I'm not talking about penalizing people for stuff that's entirely irrelevant to them (i.e. mana on melee), but I'm talking about making it so that a piece of gear represents a similar upgrade between two argetypes of classes, with a drawback to one or another.   <br />
<br />
There's been items with negative stats that people have wielded because they felt the positive outweighed the negative for them.  I used to wield a Katana of pain many moons ago, as well as a Jarsath Trident.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">At that moment, the bracers of earthen energy would be given to knights over warriors.<br />
Because warriors can get the mantle with no secondary effect.<br />
<br />
This will repeat itself for every item...<br />
<br />
Remember those &quot;Monk item&quot; days? :p<br />
<br />
I remember being yelled at because I asked for a cloak that was obviously for monks, since it had 0.1 weight.<br />
<br />
Now we'll be yelled at for asking for a haste item that has no curse..<br />
We may become favorites for those few items that have curses...<br />
but in return, we will become least favorites for the rest of the items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>wraq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I like the idea Frod. Wouldn't see it as a bad thing at all. If a haste belt dropped that didn't have a curse on it...hell yeah i would want it to go to the hybrid, my haste belt would come from a different location and would provide stats built for pure melee (or a hybrid that wanted the stats of a pure melee) but it would give a negative to the hybrid in the mana department making him want the uncursed haste belt that much more.......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>landrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I still like my idea the best.<br />
<br />
All gear has different stats depending upon class wearing it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">landrain, that still wouldnt work.<br />
<br />
Look at the EP armors... you could basicaly say its following your idea... its the same gear, but with different stats depending on class...<br />
<br />
with those, we get a ridiculous variation of hp between pl/SK and warrior....<br />
i think knights even get more ac out of it, dont they?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Kilaara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Bunnie that would work well. <br />
<br />
<br />
As you can see now lots of Items which are different when you do not reach the best level for them.<br />
<br />
Equipable at level 46 best effects at level 60.<br />
<br />
Make the same for the armor<br />
<br />
Plate BP equipable for all plate users with different stats and effects depending on the user.<br />
Like wind Instrument + XX for Bards<br />
Haste of XXX for Sks <br />
Haste of YYY for Pallis<br />
Healing bla bal XX for Clerics <br />
Aggro modifier XXX for War.<br />
<br />
And make the Stats going the same .. neg 10 int for warr with an AC HP Sta booste and less ac hp sta but wis mana for clerics .. <br />
<br />
The System is partiel already implemented with the level restrictions so it should not be the problem.<br />
<br />
You loot a Plate BP and when you equipp it it would be a warrior BP with stats for a warrior / or a Paladin BP with stats for a paladin.<br />
<br />
Itemization would be easier but coding would be a bit harder. Thats it.</div></div><hr />
