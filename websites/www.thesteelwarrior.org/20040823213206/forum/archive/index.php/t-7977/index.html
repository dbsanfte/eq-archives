<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm not sure what this virus does, but it blocks the Task Manager and msconfig when you try to Run it from the Start Menu. If you click fast enough, you can end the MSGINAV.exe process from the Task Manager but it takes a few tries. <br />
<br />
AdAware didn't find anything. Neither did SpyBot S&amp;D. <br />
<br />
MSCONFIG says the file is located in HKLM/SOFTWARE/Microsoft/Windows/CurrentVersion/Run but I can't find this direcotry to manually delete it.<br />
<br />
I got the virus from this link:<br />
DO NOT USE THIS LINK IT CONTAINS A VIRUS, IM ONLY POSTING BECAUSE IT MIGHT HELP SOMEONE MORE KNOWLEDGEABLE THAN ME GET RID OF IT<br />

<br />
Google didn't help either besides tell me that is has something to do with authenticating the logon process and uses winlogon.exe (which you can't end with the Task Manager)<br />
<br />
As a side note, I took a screenshot of the task manager trying to find the name of the new process that was running and when I was saving it as MSGINA.exe (which I meant for it to save as MSGINA.exe.jpg) I accidentally created that new file on my desktop, which now won't delete because it says its being used by another person or program...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You might try an online virus scanner (http://housecall.trendmicro.com/) like this one. Sometimes viruses can hide from software searching for them if it's running from the same computer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>faederya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">HKLM/SOFTWARE/Microsoft/Windows/CurrentVersion/Run <br />
<br />
That's in regedit<br />
<br />
Start / Run / Regedit ... browse to the above folder, clear out anything on the left pain of RUN and RUNONCE<br />
<br />
And Adware and Spybot are NOT virus scan software, they are simple Advertisemtn and Informational sending program senders.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Stop using AIM...probably solve a lot of your problems :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bonequest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I would suggest you get a good virus program like Norton or McAffee.  I have Norton and it has blocked 4 attempts to insert trojan horse viruses onto my computer from my cable internet in the last 3 weeks.   If that isn't an option, try going to their web sites and look up the virus to see what they have to say about it.  They probably know about it and if they don't they might have a way for you to submit the info on it so they can develop a detection/protection scheme for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Corpsed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yeah dont use Aol anything.  Most importantly, if you are on the internet use a virus scanner and keep it up to date.  Also dont download or open any emails with double extensions or .scr or .exe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>help</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">http://www.neuber.com/taskmanager/index.html<br />
<br />
Remove msganiv.exe.<br />
<br />
Then, go to Run &gt;&gt; msconfig and uncheck msganiv.exe.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
C:\Windows\System32\MSGinaV.exe<br />
[hidden]<br />
<br />
This file is not detected by Ad-Aware, Spy Sweeper, or Spy Doctor.  It disables viewing of the task manager, regedit.exe, and msconfig.exe.  msconfig startup says that it is located at HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run, yet it does not show that in the registry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bourbon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I would also recommend downloading and install Firefox, you can get it here http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/ and don't listen to Haass when he posts &quot;Firefox is teh sux0r&quot;, since it's huge security flaws in IE that allow websites to run arbitrary code on your computer that allowed this to happen in the first place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I already use Firefox, thanks :) I got rid of it, I went into regedit and found it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Firefox is teh sux0r.<br />
<br />
I dunno why, but that piece of shit crashes daily for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Maybe its because you don't know how to keep your comp clean from all the porn and spyware that's been installed over the years? :)<br />
<br />
Firefox is the best browser I've ever used.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">foxfire works fine for me, perhaps you got a corrupt DLL somewhere, try a windows update and a re-install</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kxorth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Haas, if you're using version 0.8 or sooner you should consider upgrading.  I know as of 0.8 I had problems with Firefox's autocomplete crashing.  Now I have 0.9.2 and those problems have gone away.</div></div><hr />
