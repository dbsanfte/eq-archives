<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">snarl</div><div class="date">05-03-2004, 10:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Last night my guild and a few extras took down Eindride Icestorm in BoT.  the MT went down when he was at about 75% and I took over aggro pretty quick and got in the corner.<br />
<br />
Now here's the wierd part.  I was in wolf form(shrunk once) for the extra ATK and he pummeled me into the corner.  When he was at about 65% he STOPPED SWINGING... for the rest of the fight the only damage taken was his AE.  Is that normal?  Or,  did I just benefit from a freak of nature?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Myrtiz</div><div class="date">05-03-2004, 10:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lol, nope that's not normal, that would make it a lot easier tho :)</div></div><hr />

Never Mind.. Was thinking of another mob(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">05-03-2004, 10:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">same holds true with auliffe.  i tanked him last night for a pu raid.  once he hit 45% he stopped attacking and kept trying to heal himself.   around 4% health he ran oom and went back to hitting me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">snarl</div><div class="date">05-03-2004, 10:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i tankeed long enough for stonewall to recycle.  i wouldn't think he would be casting THAT much :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">05-03-2004, 10:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">seriously?  we do him in my guild with 3 groups and he's at ~10% when my defensive wears off.  it's really just a matter of dps, because these guys dont have very many hps.<br />
<br />
gotta love hasted CoD pets ... they dice and slice PoP mobs to bits.<br />
<br />
from what it sounds like .. you may have experienced some sort of bug.  mobs that try to cheal themselves give up under 10% and either run or keep fighitng if they arent programmed to run.  if your dps was low such that it let you refresh defensive/stonewall at least once, then your dps wasnt sufficient to burn him down through the cheals before oom, and he should have gone back to meleeing.   methinks you just got lucky and the dev's screwed up something else yet again heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">snarl</div><div class="date">05-03-2004, 10:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">we were 12 people and no charmed pets. think there were 2 clerics and 3 druids aswell. I'm part of my guild's night crew....we tend to do things a tad out of the norm....just to see if we can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">05-03-2004, 10:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">was he swinging at all?  or was he just standing there?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">05-03-2004, 01:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">He was casting. Fairly common for him to stop meleeing midway through the fight and cast. I used to do the BoT towers nightly for several months and the general strat on Auliffe and Eindride was to blow offensive discs early and get them to 50% ASAP. Once they start casting, healers can turn on the DPS with little worry and the fight is all but over.</div></div><hr />

Corner tanking some mob shrunk, I keep walking backwards so that I can see my target. I seem to get pushed into the wall just enough that the mob can't hit me, but i can hit them.

Go go DX 9!!!</div></div><hr />

Lol...after all the times I've been pounded on and not been able to hit back since the DX 9 update I'm glad to hear someone turned the tables on the mobs for once!   (now if only this would happen to me  :p )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutonius</div><div class="date">05-03-2004, 02:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How many people were in the zone?<br />
<br />
I remember one time my guild had been doing towers and there were around 100 people in BoT.  The lag was extremely horrible.  When we pulled Brynju the lag really kicked into effect.  I was MT and didn't lose aggro during the fight but I don't remember seeing my HP dropping much at all through the fight.  The lag really made the fight easy, anyway we finally dropped him and got two Wicked Shanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slovack</div><div class="date">05-03-2004, 02:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've seen on one instance like this with this very mob. There was over 100 toons in the zone. I was told it was server side lag that caused it. On the instance i witnesed he never hit our MT once and i mean not one loss of the MT hp! It was very weird.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bigchest</div><div class="date">05-03-2004, 04:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hes a cleric so he always casts for about 40% of his last 50%, its normal and has happened everytime ive done him (probably over 20 times) chaoswind does it too</div></div><hr />

/gasp A bug that HELPS players instead of killing them?  Emergency patch!  This will be fixed immediately!  :P</div></div><hr />

 i remember some guild got caught using this sploit and something happend to em... cant remember much other than there was a pic of a cleric just standing there in front of 2 dragons..</div></div><hr />

He nukes early in the fight, if it takes you a long time to get him under 50%, he will be oom and not be able to heal himself when his HP get low.</div></div><hr />

Unfortunately, we weren't able to recreate this :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nope, no enchanter.  I did it with my two RL best friends, and we all two-box.  We had a warrior/cleric, rogue/shaman, and shadowknight/druid.  The fight took a while... a long, long while.  I think I remember going Stonewall twice.<br />
<br />
Dropped two BP molds.  =)</div></div><hr />

We figured it was lag, but it may have been something else.  I was trying to position him because I think someone aggroed him early.  I ran around to his side and he stood there for a little while without doing a thing.  So, I ran around in front again and taunted, and he started hitting me again.</div></div><hr />

10 to 13 minutes, depending on your dps.</div></div><hr />

At one point I tanked the mob in the silk tower while a full raid was starting in on Agnarr. It took about 2 min to get the named downstairs, and the poor kiters upstairs were having a hell of a time. Once I had him in position, I called the assist, and didn't take any damage for the first 30% of the fight. Agnarr dropped, and all of sudden we were back to normal, with a bit of a head start on him.<br />
