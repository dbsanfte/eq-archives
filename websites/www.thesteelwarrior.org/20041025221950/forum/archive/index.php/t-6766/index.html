<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bemyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The biggest reason Knight have been prefered over Warriors as an exp group tank is agro control.  However, even before the melee changes the end game Warriors with the use of taunt weapons, taunt augs and ae taunt aa closed the gap to the point that warriors could tank an exp group nearly as well or as well as a knight, and in a situation like LDoN hard with a boss mob warriors where prefered due to /disc defensive.  However knights could tank these bosses It just might required a bit more healing to do so.  On the whole pre GoD if a guild group needed &quot;a tank&quot; for exp War Pal and Sk where all interchangeble.  With our top quality warriors there was no need to give preference to a Knight for the tank slot.<br />

What SOE has done threw content change and melee upgrades is give a High end Warrior (the group that is most interchangable with knights) huge upgrades.  This is mainly due to the fact that defensive scales up with with the damage output of Innkiz trail bosses.  In addition Weapon affinity will increase the frenquency of agro generating procs.  And at the same time while incite is a nice tool for grabing inital agro, without agro procing weapons lower level and lesser equipted Warrior will still be far behind compareable knights.<br />
<br />
It appears to me that SOE has done a wonderfull job at identifing a problem and fixing the wrong thing.<br />

The biggest reason Warriors have been prefered over Knight as an exp group tank is survivability.  However, even before the changes to knight mitigation tables and knight spell casting the end game knights with high hp/mana all/all gear closed the gap to the point that Knights could tank an exp group nearly as well or as well as a warrior.<br />
