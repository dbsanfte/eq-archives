<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gabriel</div><div class="date">10-24-2003, 06:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">With a group of decent players (warrior 63 x 2, cleric 65, shaman 65 Not all spells, Beast lord 63 and 64, and an off group of 65 druid and possibly 63 chanter) is it possible to farm HoT or should we stick with HoH and just pray for ornate?  Would like to get everyone in decent gear so people dont laugh at our dead bodies in the planes!!!! :D :eek: <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

In fact, that is a great crew. The only thing that is a little light is the DPS, but you can solve this.<br />
<br />
Are Hatchlings still DC'able btw?<br />
<br />
Use your chanter to pacify the wurms, then pull in with the warrior.<br />
<br />
Have the ench tash it.<br />
<br />
Have the shaman slow it and then have the pets, BST, and warriors kill it :) Get your dots on the thing then hang out behind the wall to avoid AE. Druid can nuke away between AE's <br />
<br />
Make sure to get your resists up nice and high, and always leave your healers hidden behind the wall.<br />
<br />
P.S. your shaman needs Slow and Malo and they should be in good shape to slow these punks<br />
<br />
Make sure to watch your pet pushing.<br />
<br />
Always have the Chanter Sieve any white wurms, Chromodrac looking things, and other gaters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gabriel</div><div class="date">10-24-2003, 06:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sounds good, the only thing I remember about HoT is being in huge raids (back when I had to travel to school both ways uphill in the snow) and it still being a bitch.  The Druid and Chanter both have DC so I guess they can try it.  I guess we make our way in and travel down the left hall.  I have read the posts on fighting in here, basically kill the stuff at there spawn point.  Is there issues with back pops?  How long is respawns?  Anyone have a % maybe of armour drops per number of mobs?  And is there anything else we should be doing there besides just mass killage?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The funny thing about HoT is that usually more people make it more of a pain in the ass.<br />
<br />
When farming, as long as you have good spell interrupt and lots of sieving, it can be acceptable to fight stuff at the entrance rather than roaming around (ESPECIALLY since you only have one gater lol)<br />
<br />
Just gotta stay on top of the spell casters in a big way.<br />
<br />
The worst case scenario for me on armor was usually one piece out of 6-8 mobs.<br />
<br />
if you stick it out for 30-40 mobs, you will get some stuff for sure, and mostly likely some upgrades.<br />
<br />
Don't think there are any animals in ToV to DC btw. Druid will be SOL on charming.<br />
<br />
Respawns are 72 minutes. Just make sure you sieve like a fiend and you should be ok on gaters, etc...<br />
<br />
Try and pull the named mobs, and if you really want to get fancy, you can try and kill Dozekar. I would suggest if you do that, that you bring a bard and maybe one more cleric (ymmv on that one)<br />
<br />
You must get him slowed though and make sure the MA has two indoor clickable items.<br />

It won't be extremely fast killing, but the drop rate is pretty good, especially for plate.<br />
<br />
Just make SURE you stress resists and hiding from AE's to your casters and non-MT's so that you aren't spending 10 minutes medding from empty to full after each AE mob you fight.<br />
<br />
Tash-Malo-slow all mobs in quick succestion, and you should be gtg...the only side note I can think of are the glimmer drakes that are 100% MR and require the shaman to disease slow them...everything else has been covered by the other posters.</div></div><hr />

You'll be fine, HoT is a lot easier than HoH for sure.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can I just ask were ornate drops in HoH?<br />
<br />
And my suggestion is not &quot;pulling&quot; but fighting mobs (minus the pit) at spawn point to reduce any mob gating problems.<br />
<br />
And yes HoT is super easy at 65, resist 95%+ spells and mobs hit like Droga / CT mobs once slowed.. piece of cake, just tons of hitpoints on them mobs.</div></div><hr />

The guards outside will assist if that door opens and the DC pet will open the door, sooner or later.  There's also the issue of the pet engaging prematurely due to AEs.  They do make a nice damage boost though.</div></div><hr />

You may be able to manage fighting them close to spawn though. Hopefully your druid has Exodus too - CRs inside HoT can be a pain, especially since you don't have a SoS rogue, monk, SK, or necro. <br />
<br />
Definetly play it safe rather than sorry. If the puller screws up, have them die away from camp. Also have your druid willing to play it safe and evac from a fight that may or may not go your way - before people die, especially if you are deep in. <br />
<br />
You should be able to take Dozekar.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 05:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Even mobs that do not run will gate when they're low on health if they're sufficiently far away from their spawn point.  For example take any random priest or shaman in Deepest Guk.  If you fight at their spawn point they'll fight to the death like most good old Undead, but pulling them 3 screens away and they will gate.  Gating is actually a different action from running away and the only thing that can prevent gating completely is by fighting close enough to mob's spawn point, or completely draining its mana (but they seem to always have enough for a gate, no matter how much you drain).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tiejinnie</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 11:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You think a group setup like this would be enough to take on HoT named + Dozekar?<br />

65 Warrior<br />
65 Paladin<br />

Our only worry are the gating mobs. I haven't done ToV for approx 1 yr already, so forgot most of the stuff. If we are able to snare the mobs (Snare whip works?) would that prevent them from gating?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your alternative (or more probably a supplement) is to interrupt the gaters when they cast - and given your low DPS they *will* get off several gate casts, so it won't be easy with that few peeps (you only need to fail to interrupt one time after all). BST/SHM pets will help (shammy have the tri-pet AA?), also be sure you watch for the gate spell message so stunners know when to stun/kick/bash (and make sure all are stunning from the same direction so you don't negate each others' push). Maybe that shammy stun/root AA might be a worthwhile investment for this purpose? Anyone know if that works in this scenario?<br />
<br />
The best bet for sure is to fight as close to the gater's spawn point as possible, but sometimes you won't be able to manage that.<br />
<br />
I'm with the poster who recommended you evac/exodus often and early as needed. I'd have the dr00d in the main group and make sure any peeps in an off group are gate-capable or have another evacer in it. You have no corpse summoner so CR is going to be dicey. Probably better just to fight your way to corpses if you only suffer one or two deaders.<br />
<br />
BTW, I also noticed that bst pets work very well in the event that mob gets a gate off - they will charge after it and generally succeed in occupying its attention long enough to postpone the first summon and allow evac to hit. Just get that evac off the instant the mob gates. You can always fight your way back.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You don't even need to sieve really.  Torment of Scio, Theft of Thought, and that's it, nothing's gating.  Done HoT extensively, absolutely never had a mob gate with Scio on it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
One chanter can do it easy.<br />
<br />
Last time I was there with my old guild our only chanter had to log.  So he let me take over and 2 box the chanter so the raid could continue.  Knowing little about the names of enchanter spells, other than speed, mana regen, mez, and stuns, I loaded up &quot;mana seive&quot; (I had no idea what the other seives were called to identify them in his spell book at that time).<br />
<br />
Mana seive is what?  Level 34?  The lowest seive they get?<br />
<br />
Chain casting that the entire fight, nothing was ever able to gate.  Well, not even chain casting, since I had to move the chanter into line of sight between AEs, cast, then hide him behind the wall again whenever I could while main tanking at the same time.<br />
<br />
If one enchanter using the low level mana seive can do it alone, I have no doubts that one chanter can do it even easier using their other seives in addition.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can also add, without a single doubt, that a single enchanter can stop any dragon from TP'ing in HoT.  Torment of Scio &gt; any mob in HoT.<br />
<br />
I stick it on the mob around 20% health and make sure it stays on through the end of the fight.  Lately, I've been lazy and do not bother to drain mana at all (theft of thought, wandering mind, largarn's lamentation) and it still works fine.  If I'm spiteful, I cast the previously mentioned spells on the mob as well just cuz I can.<br />
<br />
HoT is completely 1 groupable, as I 6box there all the time.  I head left once in the pit and circle around from that direction.  I've killed all the named mobs in HoT (except Dozekar, I do 2 groups on him).<br />
<br />
If the enc ya get don't know squat, tell them to load up Torment of Scio, Lagarn's Lamentation and pet spell.  Tell them to cast the spells every 20% of the mob's life and to chain pet, while they pick their nose.  If they never bought Torment of Scio, then use Torment of Argli (level 56).  If they don't have either, then they need to delete the char....   or use mana sieve and perhaps Color Slant if they're really bad (personal based AoE drains 100mana).  Chaining those a bit should be enuf to keep it from gating, but the torment spells are so much easier and definate.</div></div><hr />

This always amazes me. I 2box with a druid a little bit and am confused enough with that. 6 boxes though. I tip my hat. :)</div></div><hr />

No need to tip your hat though, I'm not worth it ;)<br />
<br />
The big step is getting used to two, that was the toughest part.  The real trick is playing one toon so long that you watch TV while 'playing' EQ.  If you can do that while playing 2 toons, then 3... then you're ready for 6 :)  You can drop watching TV at that point or if you're working up to 12box, then keep watching TV !!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gabriel</div><div class="date">11-15-2003, 03:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good Morning!!<br />
<br />
  Quick update to HoT.  We went with a group last night.  Group consisted of:<br />
<br />
All 65<br />
Warrior (me)<br />
Shaman<br />
Cleric<br />
Chanter<br />
Monk<br />
BeastLord<br />
<br />
The chanter was KoS to CoV and did the death run to the entrance.  After we got him ressed up, we pulled the first fiery guardian on the left side.  AE turned out to be a problem but not a big one.  We had people sit in the middle while we fought and the chanter got agro through the closed door.....  Now I have heard both was, the door doesnt matter.  Well it didnt, the door was closed and they still came in and ate his lunch...  But we still killed the mob, ressed and proceeded to pull almost non-stop for about an hour.<br />
<br />
We killed all types of mobs, we pulled them to the pit area.  Non gated with the chanter there.  None at all were a problem, they just have a shit load of hit points.  Got 2 drops in the hour.  Chanter got gloves and the cleric got a bracer.  FH bracers are better than the SS quest ones it seems.<br />
<br />
All in all, it was a piece of cake.  After the inital break, there really is no danger.  We ported out at the hour point so we didnt get repops, but hell we would have moved in prior to that, as we had the right halls cleared by that time.  I would say 5 minute fights, 1 or 2 CH from the cleric with the shammy doing his spot heals on the rest.  No one else got below 50%.<br />
<br />
We will be going back when we all have more time.  Upgrade the hell out of our stuff and then move on.  Finally feeling the power!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">11-15-2003, 06:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">AE should never be a problem with 1 group when you are sitting at the entrance.  You push shit into the corners with the firepots, and have your casters sit just out of AE range by sitting around the corner you have now created with the wall near the steps going down into the pit, like this.  I'd draw a picture, but that shit never seems to work in posts.  Needless to say, if you can't figure out what I'm saying, just stand there and look at it for a minute, you'll see out how you can create a situation where your casters can sit out of the AE line of sight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gabriel</div><div class="date">11-16-2003, 02:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep thats what we did at the beginnnig.  The birds from outside agrooed the KoS chanter.  It was funny as hell watching him die as we killed the 1st mob.....  Everyone else was fine.  Even in the pit we had the casters in the alcove and they were good to go.  Would be a viable AA spot as well if the freekin mobs didnt have ungodly amounts of HPs.</div></div><hr />

Me thinks ya had the enchanter sitting at the wrong spot.  When you enter HoT, it kinds looks like this:<br />
<br />
|..pit w/drags......|<br />
|.......-------......|<br />
|.......|||||||......|<br />
|...XX|||||||XX...|<br />
|...XX-------XX...|              X = casters sit there, switch sides<br />
|.......................|              on pulls of guardians<br />
|.pot..........pot...|<br />
--------......------<br />
|||||||||....|||||||<br />
                                              &lt;--- entrance door<br />
<br />
You should not have folks that are kos near the door at all.  You should put casters on one side of that middle wall (opposite where you fight) and have them poke out to nuke/debuff/dot.  Then switch sides when you pull the other guardian.<br />
<br />
Also, I find the left hand side much easier to work out as fewer roamers and I always get singles, right hand side seems slightly harder as you can end up with 2/3 pulls very easily.<br />
<br />
Also, keep in mind that you can pin a mob in any corner and place casters right around that corner and beat the snot out of them and avoid the aoe on the casters.  Just be a little creative and you'll find tons of spots, thats what this dungeon is all about.  You can also just sit and take the AOEs, but with just a single group, it is much wiser to conserve.<br />
