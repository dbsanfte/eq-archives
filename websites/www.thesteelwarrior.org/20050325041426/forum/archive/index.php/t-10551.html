<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">02-05-2005, 01:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This came up in a thread on the offical boards. Just for the record here, in case it comes up:<br />
<br />
Average Damage Avoidance = (1 - dodge)(1 - parry)(1 - mitigation)<br />
<br />
Mob hit rate is ignored or assumed to be constant between classes (if you make cross class compairisons). <br />
<br />
As a note, since multiplication is associative, it dosen't matter if  parry or dodge are checked first, the math comes out the same. Factoring in block is a non-trivial matter, since it can be activated via skill and mitigates an absolute (rather than relative) amount of  damage. That is probably the next step. <br />
<br />
Kailynn at 54, without shield avoids or mitigates 53.52% of incoming damage. With shield and in defensive mitigation rises to 65.91% of incoming. <br />
<br />
There is an assumtions that defensive = 10% mitigation which I have not tested myself. <br />
<br />
There was a bit of a storm over the fact that rogues appear to tank better, but the analisys did not inclue block, agro management, defensive stance, or that rogues are far mre vulnerable to damage spikes (due to high avoidance and low mitigation).<br />
<br />
PS Excel is great for figuring ADR.</div></div><hr />

those values the %'s shown in the UI?</div></div><hr />

Have a link to that thread?  Trying to find anything on those boards is like trying to teach a cat to play piano.<br />

And I make math mistakes early on (though the board did do its job and help me correct them). <br />
<br />
Really didn't want to link as it starts out as a whine that rogues tank better, and the original math head's original post was wrong (and edited)...<br />

So at least for me (on that thread) I am using therms I and most others here are most familiar with.</div></div><hr />

 As Kailyn said, the term mitigate and avoid and their variants are, for lack of a better term, technical terms we use to describe precise mechanics in games like EQ and WoW. Mitigation is how hard (damaging) you are likely to be hit. Whereas, avoidance is used to describe how often you get hit.<br />
<br />
Mitigation is generally better for tanks because it makes it easier for healers to time their spells in order to heal the tank before they die without wasting mana though each can be just as efficent over time. AC determines mitigation and as such tanks have the best (highest value) AC out of all the classes.<br />
<br />
That is, if you cared to know...</div></div><hr />

I can look at my character profile, see how much armor I have. It then will give me a percentage on a similar level mob on how much damage reduction  there is. No where can I find percent to block, dodge, parry, miss or &quot;mitigation.&quot; <br />
<br />
I've learned a tremendous amount in the two weeks I played but can't find answers to certain questions on my own. Any direction to a  link to describe some of these things must of you take for granted would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">02-08-2005, 01:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you hit P for your Powers menu (or what ever it really is, that is the name I think of it by) you will see your basic attack icon. If you mouse over that you will get a discription and crit %. Same for the Dodge, Parry and Block.<br />
<br />
If this is your first MMOG I will tell you have I have learned--manuals are always incomplete, and hint books are not worth it. THe internet is the place to find the answers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">02-08-2005, 02:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So far most things in WoW have worked by adding, i.e. if you've a talent that adds 10% to a skill with 20% to succeed it now succeed 30%, so I'd assume p/d/b will just be added together as well, unlike EQ where you're rolling a dodge on what you didn't parry, and so on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Talents and the combat model aren't really related, though.<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what I was trying to say here, but I failed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">02-08-2005, 02:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well it's not exactly that hard.  If you p/d/b 5% each, then it'd be something like:<br />
<br />
roll 1-100<br />
if 1-5 dodge<br />
if 6-10 parry<br />
if 11-15 block<br />
rest will be hit (okay maybe 16-17 will be miss).<br />
<br />
There certainly isn't any barrier to prevent it working like this.  I don't claim to know which model the game runs on, but so far just about everything in WoW works via adding, i.e. a 5% skill + 5% = 10%, as opposed to 1.05 X 1.05.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Average Damage Avoidance = (1 - dodge)(1 - parry)(1 - mitigation)<br />
<br />
However the code actually works in-game, getting an average is going to be multiplcative, because you can't mitigate damage on a hit that missed you completely.  I didn't make that very clear on my last post.<br />
<br />
I also misread your first post.  Mitigation is really where the additive thing doesn't work, and that was what I was refuting.  The equation is for Average Damage Reduction, not straight Avoidance Chance.</div></div><hr />
