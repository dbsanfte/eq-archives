I just use the taunt key. I see people mention using beg/disarm to taunt. How is this done? Do you set a macro or something? Is sitting a good thing to do? Any advice is appreciated. Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">11-20-2003, 10:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">you can setup macro key<br />
<br />
/doability 1(taunt)<br />
/doability 2(beg)<br />
/doability 3(disarm)<br />
<br />
(I think ability number depens on what number you have assigned that ability with right click in the abilities menu)<br />
<br />
the drawback is that you can't see when the actuall skills recycle including taunt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">11-20-2003, 10:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">beg/disarm is a skill - if you pull up the skills tab you should be able to see those skills. cant rememebr if you have to train them if you have never used them before.<br />
<br />
you can then drag those two buttons over to your hotbank and use accordingly.<br />
<br />
there jurys still out on how much hate you actually get from using them, but for what its worth i guess theres no harm having a couple extra buttons to press.<br />
<br />
as for using the taunt key, well, the first thing is dont mash it. use it when you lose aggro. not sure what level you are but only if you need to train up your skill then mash the taunt key.<br />
<br />
the way i try and set things up in exp groups is to stay close to the sham/slower and preferably having them opposite me. i then watch for the cast messages.<br />
<br />
for shams, normally they will malo first. then slow. watch the slow to cast, cast time is 3 seconds.<br />
<br />
once slow lands, get ready to taunt. if aggro sticks to you then fine, but if not thats the time to taunt.<br />
<br />
normally if you time it right,and on a successful taunt, you can pretty much ensure the sham avoids even a single hit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not worth it.<br />
<br />
Disarm works while fighting and is unlinked to any other combat skill .. I mash that one, I might as well, so I do.<br />
<br />
<br />
Taunt itself I often use right after I see a Slow or other debuff message, such as Tash and Malo. Usually the MOB will stick to me when I do that, even if more casts of slow and tash occurs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your taunt macro lines would be better used for things that are really important, like roleplaying emotes or something.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />

 Just drag the taunt hotkey over there. Having a disarm or a beg in there won't make or break a warrior, it'll do nothing. Kinda like eating ice cream... EMPTY CALORIES! :eek:</div></div><hr />
