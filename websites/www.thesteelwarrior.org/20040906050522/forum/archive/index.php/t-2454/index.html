<br />
basicly, you warrior, when he uses this skill leaves himself open, now if you fail the monster doesnt fall for it, if you get a success the monster will attack you, 2 things can happen from here<br />
<br />
1. your reposit roll adds a modifer, this is added to your reposit and you get a &quot;surprise blow&quot; which is a critcal reposit plus the modifer on reposit based skill. (you gain as much agro as you do from taunt but you also get to do dmg, making a 2 hander a much more viable option {because you only get 1 proc otherwise} while still making a set of 1 handers be formitable)<br />
<br />
2. you roll a success, now the second part of the roll can do the above, or you can fail the second half and the monster gets a extra attack on you, but you still get a extra attack plus taunt agro)<br />
<br />
i know this is kinda confusing but what im getting at is that a warrior skill that doesnt use magic could be feigning a opening for a enemy attack that is to temping to pass up, and once the mob find out its a trap it pisses it off more(because it relised what a mistake it made and how much of a dumbshit it is) but the warrior could still mess up and get hit, while still generating agro (fugging up would make the warrior seem unskilled and a easy target, making the mob still attack them) or the mob could ignore it completely like it would a monk that fails at FD(well in reverse, hehe)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It's a good thought, but I think it falls under SOE's reason (read: excuse) taunt doesn't work in that higher level creatures aren't susceptible to being called names and falling for tricks. They got to be high level creatures for a reason.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">That's such a lame excuse... you'd think that with all my experience, I've become accustomed to what pisses people off.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">im 60 and stuff still pisses me off.....</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i also have some new idea's i got today, <br />
<br />
sword hand smash (real life attack move, from eurasia area)<br />
a warrior with guantlets may reverse the sword hilt into a blunt smash attack, the way it is done it causses extreme head damage<br />
----- impletmenation<br />
a cheap ass warrior stun, useable every 1 min 30 seconds after level 55, and once every 50 seconds after 60.<br />
<br />
<br />
sword break/remove (real life attack, from the china/japan area)<br />
basicly, the attacker does not really focus their attacks on the person, but rather their weapon, after some stress their wepoan would crack, or the defender's arms would get tired enough that the weapon can be easly knocked from their hand<br />
--- implementation<br />
basicly when active, every warrior attack is blocked for a few seconds, when this is timer is up, the mob is disarmed, weapon placed in their inventory(this is so magic weapons can be effected)<br />
<br />
koti(sp??) (koran area, real life attack)<br />
basicly it is a move used when fighting a skilled enemy, it is a well thought out attack, the first weapon is used to attack very slowly, such as a wide swing, this is ment to be blocked, at this point the attack sneaks in a second attack, most of the time catching the defender off guard, this move is looked on as dishonorable, as its primaly used by cutthroats.<br />
--- implementation<br />
basicly the main hand weapon attack is blocked, then the second hand weapon gets a instant crippling blow, maybe a 1 min reuse OFF THE DISCPLINE TIMERS hehe<br />
<br />
<br />
all of this im hoping can be used in everyday xp groups</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">basicly, the attacker does not really focus their attacks on the person, but rather their weapon<br />
<br />
The vast majority of mobs out there aren't armed, therefore, this wouldn't affect them at all. On the up side, it might marginaly tick off a mob like our Disarm skill.<br />
<br />
sword hand smash<br />
<br />
This wouldn't be hard to implement at all, especially with the old pally '2h bashable weapon' code still in the game somewhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">maybe that disarm attack i spoke of could be changed a little to weaken how they attack, like the arms of humanoid mobs, not a slow effect of any sort, something that just takes off a percent of their dmg ability that doesnt stack with other warriors doing it, maybe a good amount of agro from it to</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">and that was ment to be sword handle smash lmfao</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I still like the ability to 'pin' a mob, but knowing SOE, they'd make it Large Races Only. /rude</div></div><hr />
