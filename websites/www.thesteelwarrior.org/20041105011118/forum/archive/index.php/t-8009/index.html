<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rothander</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok i have an anger 3d BoC for mainhand, and am trying to figure out what to Offhand.<br />
<br />
I have a Obsidian Scimitar of war or a sparkling shortsword for offhand.<br />
<br />
What aug should i have on offhand, Anger 3 or Permafrost.   Id put the guk one on but i have no points there and i am looking for something to fill in.  Or is there a MM aug?  <br />
<br />
I use the arbitor shield with my BoC when i am MTing in a raid situation for the AC and HPs.<br />
<br />
This would mainly be for exp groups, and tanking  where i wouldent use the shield.<br />
<br />
Any input is appreciated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Neither the Obsidian Scimitar of War or a Sparkling Shortsword are aggro weapons. If you must chose between the two, the Obsidian Scimitar of War's minor AC debuff will generate more aggro. To be honest, I'd suggest obtaining a Copper Hammer of Striking or Sword of the Bloodsworn instead if possible.<br />
<br />
An anger aug is fine for generation aggro on your offhand weapon. Permafrost is not - DD alone doesn't really generate aggro. Better yet might be Force (or Strike) of YKesha.<br />
<br />
In a nutshell, my suggestion would be to obtain a CHoS and augment it with Force of YKesha.<br />
<br />
If however you must stick with the weapons and augs you have mentioned, I'd suggest the Obsidian Scimitar of War with an anger aug on it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>BabaHanz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I know warriors who prefer the OSoW over a BoC.  The OSoW has an increased proc rate, and let's not forget when a frostbringer was a real nice agro weapon, and that has an AC debuff.  Most warriors I know compare an AC debuff to a stun, or very slightly under.  My advice would be to offhand the OSoW and throw a yak aug onto it, that way you get both dps and agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Frostpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I would anger 3 the OSoW, and I would wait until they finalize and go live with the aug-removal/recycle/re-sell/thingy scheduled for next patch before i did that. Only reason I'd say go for anger 3 is that you wil eventually want A3 on both hands when dual wielding and A3 for a 2hander too (maybe on the 2hander, kinda depends on what you're in to, and what you get to drop for ya).  No reason to buy something inferior to anger 3 if you can put it on OSoW and then swap it out to something you like more when the time comes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'd a3 the OSOW.I've never had one,but, I've heard good things about it.A lot of people would rate it as an aggro weapon of better than CHOS stature.I've seen a few ma's going through that content use that as their offhand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vilicontus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I wield a Hategiver Primary and the Scimitar Secondary, both auged with Anger 3. While lots of people debate on the scim's aggro, you have to admit the stats are worth it, and Anger 3 augs more than cover the aggro you need. A rogue went omfg you have twin anger 3s during a bot group once lol. <br />
About the ONLY thing I miss while wielding this combo, is the lack of any stuns to interrupt casters  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">the Sparkling Shortsword is better DPS than aggro, and the Obsidian Scimitar of War is ok DPS (little less than the SS but far better than the CHoS) and ok aggro (a little bit less than the CHoS but far better than the SS). so if you want to keep them both go for the A3 on the OSoW and the DD on the SS so depending on situation you will be able to increse either your DPS alone when you don't want aggro, or increase your aggro correctly when you want it.<br />
<br />
As BB said OSoW isn't the best choice for aggro, but it's still ok. Moreover you will be soon able to remove the A3 of the OSoW so that you will be able to improove your aggro setup as soon as you can pick up a better aggro 1Her. Thus it isn't a waste to augment the OSoW with A3.<br />
<br />
And about stunning caster, it's not your job because :<br />
1. you can't predict when your stun proc will fire (1s before it's too early, 1s after it's too late)<br />
2. the stun proc up to lvl 65 are very uncommon to us because the majority stops at lvl 55.<br />
3. the casters classes have stun on demand up to lvl 65.<br />
so don't choose your proc with the 'stunning caster mob' aim.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Holywrath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Mainhand the OSOW with A3 and offhand the BoC.  I *believe* I heard about warriors doing this for the increased proc mod on the OSOW, and the math worked out to that it would generate more potential aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I don't think so, over the course the increased proc rate is not big anougth to match thre difference of aggro between EB (700Hate) and OS (less than 400Hate) so for long run it's better to keep the BoC in main.<br />
Howerver, putting the OSoW in main sure help to get a early proc at the beginning of the fight because of the increased proc rate. So it can be argued for the exp group that OSoW in main is better because the fight will be short.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Rothander</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">This is all really great info guys. thanks alot. I will anger 3 the scimi, and then 150dd the SS for DPS.   I need a non aggro combo for DPS when i am not tanking, as we have found out Turning TZ in time = BAD MOJO.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the wealth of info.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Force shock is an estimated 400-450 hate per proc<br />
Obsidian Shatter is estimated at 300-350 per proc<br />
<br />
We will give both the benefit of the doubt and round it up to the higher number.<br />
<br />
2 x 450 = 900 hate per min from procs (mainhand)<br />
2.5 x 350 = 875 hate per min from procs (mainhand)<br />
1 x 450 = 450 hate per min from procs (offhand)<br />
1.25 x 350 = 437.5 (offhand)<br />
<br />
15/19 in offhand is better than 13/20 or even 14/18 for both dps and offhand aggro (which is small) ... and probably equates to greater than the 12.5 spell hate lost from a slightly weaker proc.  The stats on the OSoW are much better, so it is always better than Copper hammer of striking, and situationally even better than the greatblade of storms.<br />
<br />
That said, the Greatblade of storms is better for aggro if youre talking mainhand, but offhand they really are too close for it to even matter.  Any warrior who has a Blade of Carnage will have that mainhanded anyways, so the argument is moot.  I have both the GBoS and the OSoW and i am very strongly considering moving my anger3 to it for daily use over the GBoS.  The only perk to using OSoW mainhand vs either the BoC or the GBoS is getting the early proc.  Early procs &gt; strong procs in short fights (as most warriors will agree).  To say that over any length of time OSoW is better aggro than a BoC is just plain wrong though.  EB is at least twice as strong as obsidian shatter.<br />
<br />
Reccommend he go out and buy a lesser weapon to anger3 it is a mistake.  Stick with the scimitar and toss an anger3 on it.  You wont be dissapointed.<br />
<br />
ps- to say that the OSoW isnt an aggro weapon makes no sense ... i've seen the carnage that ensues when a ranger gets his hands on this puppy and doesnt understand that ac debuff = death.  it really is about the same thing as chain casting flame lick (rangers best aggro spell) ... they even have the same spell emote.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Neksnappa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I've got an OSoW primary, with only A2 aug, and a dd auged CHSD offhand, since i'm saving points for a better aggro weap. With 305 dex and WA5 my OSoW procs like crazy. On raids when I am designated second tank should the main tank die, I used to keep my osow/chsd equipped to stay high on the aggro list. I can no longer do this, because I commonly out-aggro warriors with a boc/gbos/HG/BF mainhanded. Hell, on my last solro mini raid, the main tank was using an A3'ed BoW. I stole aggro after around 10 seconds, backed up for the next 15% of the mobs health, moved back in and still had aggro. Anyone who says OSoW is not an aggro weap is dead wrong. As mentioned, a boc will generate more aggro over time, but I wouldn't mainhand one over my OSoW simply because more often than not, I get a &quot;Target is surrounded by flickering flames&quot; within seconds of turning on attack.<br />
<br />
To the original poster, you should definitely A3 the OSoW. BoC/OSoW is a great combo, but I advise you to try mainhanding the scimmy for a few fights and see how you like it. No matter which hand they are in, they are both great weapons so you can't go wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Groovdog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I offhand a OSoW and with WA2 and 305dex and it procs fairly frequently. I augged it with FoY and am very happy with it. My pally has the permafrost aug on his Vel. GBlade and I am quite happy with that as well, but he doesnt want the aggro.<br />
<br />
I guess in the end it depends on what you are doing, I did the FoY aug cause I dont have a problem with aggro (DBoTW w/ ang3 is mainhand) but if you are having aggro issues then aug the OSoW with anger3. Def. do the permafrost in the offhand dps wep.<br />
<br />
With the upcoming aug system there will be less pain involved in switching back and forth although you will ikely take the anger3 aug4-aug8 hit (50% pt loss it looks like) anyways at some point if you are going go for the big aggro weps.<br />

I learn a new thing every day. Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>BlaydennSL</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I have an OSoW with Anger3 on it, and I was never happy with it, in either offhand or primary. Went back to using Acrylia Handled Broadsword with Anger3 and CHoS, and never had any problems. I've basically bagged the OSoW, and only use it for DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Cuthbadth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I have an OSoW with Anger3 on it, and I was never happy with it, in either offhand or primary.

<br />
One thing to consider about the OSoW's proc rate being higher, is mainhanding it increases the odds of a proc much sooner in a fight...which to me is slightly more important as generating most potential agro.  As the knights have established, the sooner the agro, the sooner the mob is slowed and voila a better xp machine, err tank.  Although I do not have anything better than the Droga pair, so I am not commenting from first hand experience.  However, am I off my rocker thinking the increase proc rate should typically establish agro sooner?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">OSoW + anger 3 &gt; AHB + anger3  ... for aggro that is.<br />
OSoW +anger3 &gt; CHoS + anger3 ... for everything<br />
OSoW &gt; AHB ... for aggro<br />
OSoW &gt; CHoS ... for everything<br />
<br />
Congratulations, you bagged the best weapon in your arsenal for a lesser setup.  OSoW + CHoS will yield the best aggro ... AHB + OSoW will yield the best dps.  As is, you picked probably the worse available option btw 3 weapons and ran with it because youre gut told you something false.<br />
<br />
Why anyone would waste and anger3 on a AHB is beyond me.  Let the rangers/rogues play with that puppy ... it's a waste of a weapon on a warrior unless you have AHB's literally coming out your ears.<br />
<br />
*edit- i noticed in your magelo you have a blade of carnage ... move your anger3 to it off your AHB and keep the AHB bagged except when you need a dps weapon to put in your mainhand.  OSoW will outperform any other weapon you have on a strict aggro basis ... and you really arent giving up more than a whole whopping 5 dps and practically 0 stats for stronger aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Yeh, Blayd sry man that makes no sense at all.The OSOW is a far better aggro weapon than the AHB.I've got a AHB in my bag I used to use for dps.</div></div><hr />
