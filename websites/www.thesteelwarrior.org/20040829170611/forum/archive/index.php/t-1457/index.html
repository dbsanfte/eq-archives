<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Timmok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am wondering what kind of AA-rate could I expect dual-boxing with a level 65 elemental planes flagged shaman out of group?<br />
<br />
Currently I get 1 AA pr 1 hour 13 mins in typical BoT groups, and 1 AA pr 40-50 mins in EP groups(depending on the group). <br />
<br />
I have a second computer that is currently broken, but its not really worth spending money on fixing it if the AA rate two-boxing is worse than say the BoT full group rate. After the recent patch it seems to have become alot easier finding groups there for me at least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm not XP'ing in BOT, nor do I plan to be in the forseeable future, but I can tell ya what I've seen.<br />
<br />
In my favorite dungeon, a 4-some with constant pulls gave me an AA in just under 2 hours.  I took my 2 toons to my duo spot today and altho it's nowhere near the XP rate I get grouped, it's not bad.  It's definitely better than it used to be.<br />
<br />
It's my contention that 2 boxing will yield better results than pre-patch, however if you have the option between getting a group and 2 boxing, get a group man, the XP freakin flies with 4 or more people and no downtime.  If you find yourself having difficulty getting groups for whatever reason, then I think 2 boxing is a viable solution to that problem, but it's nowhere near the XP rate a full group could rake in, nor should it be.  2 boxing should be what you do when there's no one else online and you just wanna finish up a few blues here or there.</div></div><hr />
