<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wompem Ondahed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been meaning to post this for a while, but didn't want to start a new thread. I feel a new thread with a clear title will help catch the eye and allow others to post their own experience so that our community can make an informed decision.<br />
<br />
After two weeks of testing I am sad to say that I prefer the GSoT aggro over CHoS and SotB. This is with my regular XP group ( me, 65 cleric, 65 rogue epic/primal, the other 65 rogue epic/primal, 65 necro, 63 ench). We know each other well, and they know the limits of my aggro. After many many hours of the 1h combo I was beginning to get a complex. I just couldn't hold aggro off the rogues for more than a few seconds.<br />
<br />
I later tested this with a same cleric and chanter, and a pickup group of 58 mage 58 wizard and 61 ranger ( Swiftwind + 14/22 sword) . Each of these classes were pulling aggro off of me, so after an hour I switched my GSoT in and they rarely found themselves tanking. I am not a taunt-masher, but when using the 1h combo I found myself having to use taunt as quick as it refreshed due to others tanking instead of me.<br />
<br />
I will say this, I may have to augment my AA's to be more 1h friendly before I pass swift judgement. My current offenisve AA setup is this:<br />
<br />
65 war<br />
280 dex during these battles<br />
Ferocity 1 ( good for 1hs and 2hs )<br />
Improved Crits 1 ( or whatever it is called )<br />
Punishing Blade 2<br />
<br />
Now I think if I had more ferocity + ambidexterity it would help out, but as of now I am not not feeling the same confidence. When GSoT procs mobs turn to me. When either CHoS or SotB procced, mobs only turned 1/5 times. I really do hope to improve my 1h aa and try again, because I enjoy dual wielding after many months of Windblade and then GSoT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bulbog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have both CHoS and SotB but have only had them for a few days.  So far though, I've noticed that the aggro is decent from them though but it seems as if GSoT is better.  In the past I had been dual wielding frosty + snare whip, and if I'd lose aggro on a slow, one proc from either of them would snap the mob right back to me and aggro would most likely be locked.  Now with the CHoS+ SotB I don't get that snap back on procs anymore.  Frosty would just need to proc once to bring aggro to me or lock it, with these I've had the proc go off while trying to regain aggro off a slow(wasn't resisted, just early slow) and it didn't pull aggro so I had to wait for taunt to recycle.  Basically it's not been long since I've had these weapons so I guess I have to give them some more time but atm GSoT aggro just seems surperior to the combo(this is with only general AA's + nd1)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think there's something else going on there to be honest.  The other warrior I group with uses Copper Hammer/Bloodsworn, and I use BoC/SoD, and the reason he uses that combo is because when we're both on the same mob, a single proc from either of us, from either weapon, will prevent mobs from turning to the druid after snare or the shaman after slow, without fail.<br />
<br />
Greatstaff of thunder is nice, sure, but when the other option is dual wielding stun weapons, I can't see us ever going back.  Don't kid yourself here...warriors are stll broken and still rely on procs, and I'd much rather rely on 2 proccing weapons than 1 2h.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gonaden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I can't see how the GSoT would maintain aggro better, as its DPS output compared to the CHoS/SotB is almost identical, and all 3 weapons have a zero-second stun proc.  So surely the 2 1-handers will proc stun more often than the GSoT, meaning they will hold aggro better??  Not to mention the DD part of the 1-handers procs...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">GSoT stun now 1 second and works upto 65...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wompem Ondahed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well, like I said, I do believe my AA is weighted for 2h weapons. Punishing Blade is a legitimate DPS boost, and I generally parse 10-15 dps more. I will agree with you Haas, we do rely on procs, but until we get a proc DPS is the only thing holding mobs off of anyone else.<br />
<br />
I did not come up with this by myself, it came from me, the cleric, the chanter, the rogues, and even the pickup group ranger noticed. I do believe once my AA are more equal that perhaps the 1h setup will take over and I am actually hoping for this.<br />
<br />
Please remember the title, 2 weeks of testing. This is by no means scientific and I will continue trying each setup with various xp groups and the occasional raid my small guild does. I posted so I could get others feeedback and appreciate each one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I was noticing my ChoS/SotB combo was kind of lacking in a PoS Forest Giant group (61+ mobs). The CHoS stun doesnt land, so I was only getting (crappy) aggro from the 179dd. I switched SotB to mainhand and found it to work better, but the group broke up before I had a chance to test my GSoT.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not true.  You still get the aggro for the stun whether it lands or not.  Ask any paladin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You still get aggro from resisted stuns, even if the mob is immune.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Rodney</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Have about 2 weeks now on the Copper &amp; Blood and only had the GSoT out once.  In the Jail area in Droga after two hrs of 1hand I took out the GSoT to compare and noticed very little difference.  One area I have noticed a BIG difference is in haste I need to do my job.  Was in COD last night and had a new chanter this time and I had to ask for haste.  I would notice no haste icon and had no idea how long I had been without it, I saw no diffence in my argo, I cant say that about the GSoT.  Checked the log later that night and my dps droped from 74 dps (past week in COD) to 69 dps for that night.   With the GSoT with out haste I was doing a lot of running and I knew when my haste was down.  One more point with the GSoT I get 1 stun every 30 sec with the Copper &amp; Blood I get one stun proc every 20 sec (280 dex).   Also the proc on the GSoT has been 1 sec 65 for a long time.<br />

I also weild these 3 weapons with my now 59 warrior. My usual group consists of 59 war/65 wiz (both played by me), 65 cleric, 65 bard, 65 ranger and a 65 mage or 65 enchanter taking the last spot. We usually will hunt in CoD or PoS. I have had vastly different results with my weapons, but I think that is because I don't have any AA at all.<br />
<br />
In my experience, all 3 procs have very good agro. The GSoT does proc a pretty good amount, but no where near the rate that the 1h combo does. When I was using 2h exclusively, I found that I had a bit of a hard time maintaining agro on an early slow. If I got a quick proc, then no problem - agro right back on me. I also found that I could not be as liberal with my nuking. As long as I had a couple procs, I could blast away.<br />
<br />
With the 1h combo I have found that establishing good agro is faster. Not only is the DPS slightly higher, but I tend to get more procs per mob with the 1hers. Once I get a proc or 2, I can usually unload with the wizard<br />
<br />
While none of these set ups is as good as a chain stunning pally or a 2x EB warrior, any of the 3 is still far better than was available to the casual non uber player just a short couple of months ago. For the effort or price involved in getting these weapons, they just can't be beat. Any warrior who does not have EB or a GBoS should carry these 3 weapons.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>aguktawarrior</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I have also used all 3 weapons in a controlled group that i always play with. the CHoS and SotB had more potential agro, but the GSoT was a more reliable agro weapon. for me the CHoS and SotB just didnt proc enough to maintain taunt. my GSoT, on the other hand, has the dps to survive a bad streak of no procs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I dont agree that the GSoT will get better aggro due to dps. Assuming no offensive aa's, they parse almost identically.<br />
<br />
Re aggro, from swopping out both repeatedly i think the GSoT does have the edge in terms of pure aggro. However, to me, whats important is the first 15 seconds of combat when i need that proc to ensure the slower doesnt get mashed and in that respect the 1hand combo wins hands down because of the higher proc rate - and a proc from either 1 hander is enough tokeep aggro on me through a slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Dakanzzar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">OK, with No AAs at all (so no 1hs or 2hs), I find the two 1hs hold aggro better than the GSoT. Mainly because I'm almost guaranteed a proc b4 the mob hits 90 (poss 2 procs). This means I can even forget to hit taunt on slow msg occaisionally and the aggro is still mine. <br />
I try not to forget to hit it though, coz that'll be the time it eats my shammie :)<br />
With GSoT that proc just wouldn't happen soon enough for me and quite often by the proc would go just after the slow when its too late :/<br />

Up to now I've been training up my 1hb skill, so perhaps my experience so far is skewed, but I do find that the proc on the GSoT doesn't seem to get resisted as much, and when it fires it gets snap aggro, whereas the proc on the 1-handers even when it fires doesn't guarantee snap aggro.<br />
<br />
My 1hb is 220 now, so I'll hold judgement until its maxed, but up to now I am tending towards classing the GSoT as the better weapon for aggro.</div></div><hr />

I run behind and whack em silly, kickstun if lucky. She's telling me that using those two weps saves her about 15% mana as opposed to using GSoT. <br />

<br />
I used the gsot for a while. it had about the same aggro/proc rate as the warrior 2hs epic. <br />
<br />
Now i use the chos and the red blade and I have noticed a marked increase in aggro control. even with a 65th lvl beastlord and his pet beating on it i can move the mob away from the pet. With the epic or gsot if i backed off the mob would turn to the pet. <br />
<br />
as for the bloodsworn.. i was not too impressed with it in the offhand. <br />
<br />
<br />
now on the beta server i grabbed a boc and the chos. 4 casters me and a cleric. nuking dotting like mad and i was able to hold aggro.<br />
<br />
cant wait till i get that combo live.</div></div><hr />

Be HAPPY there is a 2h that is easily obtainable that does decent dps and aggro.  Then go get it.</div></div><hr />

The 2h only does better DPS than the 1hers if you have 2h DPS AAs. If you have no AAs or you have both 1h and 2h AAs then they parse out pretty equally, with the edge going to the 1h combo due to the procs. You should parse how much damage you are taking from riposte some time. On exp type mobs and the bosses that someone wielding these weapons is generally going to be tanking, the difference in damage is not worth the difference in agro. By the time you are tanking bosses in PoP where the riposte damage is significant, chances are that you will be weilding better than any of these anyway.<br />
<br />
but I do find that the proc on the GSoT doesn't seem to get resisted as muchThis seems to keep coming up in this and other threads. If you parse it, you will find that the resist rate for each of these procs is exactly the same if you are parsing on the same type mob. Take a look at the resist adjustments, they are all are checked against magic and none has a resist check modifier. Any difference in reist rates for a period of time would be due to the RNG. Also, keep in mind that the stun and the DD portions of the SotB and CHoS procs are independent. A mob can resist/be immune to the stun and still have the DD land for full.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Scaleclad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">When I read about this combo I grabbed my 65 shm and ranger friends and went and got the pair.  After a week of raid, and exp grouping the final verdict from not me (as I dont matter), but the casters I group with, was about even, if not leaning on GSoT (I am almost always hasted).  On one raid in pericular me and a GSoT buddy offtanked some mobs, I had the CHoS/SotB he had GSoT.  It was almost impossible to hold aggro.  Even after a good run of double procs he was able to wittle back aggro in 5-15 seconds.  In the end of the fight I was always looken at back.  This is pretty impressive considering he is holding the riposte/block/parry counters and I am not.<br />
<br />
Yes, if you dont have 40k (when I got my gsot), go down and camp these two, they are a marked improvement over frosty/ice ocean, or whatever lvl 50's combo you are using.  But after running pop with the 1h's, I dont have the aa's to afford 600pt ripostes when I dont have to take them.  I sold the two at a reasonably good price and was able to bump my hp up 300hp, which made camping them for 3 hours absolutly worth it.  I am going to stick with the gsot, it has worked extremely well for me so far, and I plan on keeping it till I get a really kicken one hander.  At which point I will go back down to droga and get me one of those two as an offhand.<br />

When hasted with ench haste I like the GSOT better; when with any other haste I like the dual wield.  I'm not much of an eqlibrarian so I havent parsed or any such thing....but I do like having the option to use either setup.  It just seems as cheap as all these options are no warr should be without them (unless you are uber enough to have a better weapon set).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't have any of these weapons, nor have I tested them.  However, I have found with both 1h and 2h AA's, comparably obtainable 2h always does more dps than 1h since the damage bonus change.  When I was using Cord hilted spiked driver and SoD (which aren't bad dps, but not great), even the MUCH more easily obtainable windblade parsed 10 to 20 more DPS against exp mobs.  2h varies alot more than 1h of course.  I wish I could get a refund for ambidex.<br />

<br />
In my opinion, all PoP mobs, from plane of nightmare on up, have insanely buffed offensive/defensive skills compared to pre-pop counterparts.  Some people don't seem to care though.  I watched another guild loose 5 MT's to bertox the other night because they insisted on double wielding.  So anyways, there are obviously differences of opinion.  :)  Mine is 2h &gt; all.<br />
<br />
A one second stun, up to level 65 mobs (proc on GSoT) is insane aggro.  I played a paladin for a few nights and usually one similar stun at the beginning of the fight was enough to keep the mob off a BoW warrior.  One paladin stun + paladin melee (lol) outaggroing a BoW.  Well, i probably would have had to stun once or twice more if i wanted to consistantly hold aggro, but wasn't trying to.</div></div><hr />

Question though. GSoT stuns up to L65. Although I won't get the spell interruption from the proc, will I still get the aggro on mobs &gt;L65?</div></div><hr />

Incidently, you have basically proven my point because a windblade will parse 10-20 DPS more than a GSoT while a CHSD+SoD will parse pretty near a CHoS+SotB.<br />

So anyways, there are obviously differences of opinion.  :)  Mine is 2h &gt; all.Again, it's a matter of parsing. The bottom line is that it doesn't matter what you are weilding if you lose agro. You might be surprised at how many Tier 3+ mobs are tanked with 1hers because of the importance of maintaining agro and/or the rarity of BoW drops.<br />
<br />
A one second stun, up to level 65 mobs (proc on GSoT) is insane aggro.  I played a paladin for a few nights and usually one similar stun at the beginning of the fight was enough to keep the mob off a BoW warrior.  One paladin stun + paladin melee (lol) outaggroing a BoW.  Well, i probably would have had to stun once or twice more if i wanted to consistantly hold aggro, but wasn't trying to. Go look at the Lucy descriptions of the 3 procs involved. I find it highly unlikely that the GSoT proc is considerably more agro than a greater number of procs with a 0 sec stun. And you anecdote about the BoW warrior leads me to believe that the warrior was not trying to get agro. A single pally stun at the begining of a fight is not good enough to keep agro off anyone that wants it. Pallys get insane agro from chain stunning, not a single stun.<br />
<br />
will I still get the aggro on mobs &gt;L65? A stun generates good agro whether it lands, is resisted, or the mob is immune. Some casters swear that a resisted stun is more agro than one that lands.<br />
<br />
In any case, there is no excuse for a warrior not to have these 3 weapons in their arsenal. The hammer and sword are so easy to get you can camp them in a few nights even if you are unlucky with drops. GSoT is down under 5k on most server, under 2k on my server. There is a time and place for either set up, so why not carry both?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">GSoT is very low price and (according to the people on this board) very good agro.<br />
<br />
The two onehanders are supposedly an easy camp, and are (according to the people on this board) very good agro.<br />
<br />
Meaning that if you don't have much money or lots of friends, you can still get good agro weapons.  Frostbringers, what a lot of warriors use for agro, run 2300pp low...maybe slightly lower in early morning.  GSoT runs as low as 2k.<br />
<br />
Even if you don't think the stun will be good agro, it's a freaking 31/30 weapon with nice stats, with a proc that can stun up to level 65!  Even if just going for cheap DPS weapon, can you say that's not a good deal?</div></div><hr />

I wish I knew your secret, coz when I use my GSoT in PoV, nine times out of ten the mob will go after the slower when the slow lands, and I have to taunt to get it back on me, sometimes 2 or 3 times.  :mad:</div></div><hr />
