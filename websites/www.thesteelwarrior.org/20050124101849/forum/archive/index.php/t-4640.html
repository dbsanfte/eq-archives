I am not exactly sure on what I should try to upgrade at this point.  My eq time is pretty limited at the moment, if I can squeak out two ldon's in one night, I am usually dead tired the next day.  I am not in any guild so my raiding for equipment options are pretty non-existent. I do however, have a 65 sham on the same account that I can farm a lot of things with.  My question is this:  Given my limited amount of time, and considering my gear; is it worth it for me to upgrade with bazaar stuff, or should I wait for 61 and ornate?  I do probably need a better haste.  Is there a haste augment that is better then 27%, or some other object for 35k or under that i can get better haste from, and not lose a bunch of hp/ac?  My weapons are good, I rarely have aggro issues even when I am not hasted (except for retarded chain stunning pali aggro).  Given that I have about 35k to spend, what would be my best upgrade options, or should i just wait for ornate and build up some more plat?<br />
<br />
Edit: 58 now.  Of course magelo would be down.  I would say my weak spots are arms, and a better haste then rbg.  Otherwise I am mainly equipped with fierce heraldric with some kylong (veksar) mixed in.<br />

Thank you for your time, <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zito</div><div class="date">12-15-2003, 02:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd consider upgrading your grimling contraption mask to amygdalan chain mask, and I'd see if you can get a Cloak of Flames in your price range.  The CoF will allow you to upgrade waist slot to FH belt, gaining some AC and HP over-all.  Your arms would see a decent upgrade going to FH.  Nightmarewood compound bow would give you 5 ac and 5 HP at the loss of some sta *which you can max out with shaman potions for more hp as well*.  If you don't need bow for pulling, then goranga idol would be a cheap range slot upgrade, or golden idol of rallos zek if you need more str/sta.  I'd also upgrade your shoulder slot to FH pauldrons, or possibly horn-spiked shoulder plates *might be a bit pricey on those*<br />
Hope this helps</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renix</div><div class="date">12-15-2003, 07:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd say that your fine equipment wise, your haste is OK, and you've got a very nice amount of HP for your level.<br />
<br />
I've dumped well over 135k worth of items onto my warrior and I've just recently broken the 1100 AC and 3k HP mark. Of course I'm a Vah Shir, so I have small innate STA (which hurts a bit) and most of my equipments have direct HP (instead of STA), so I'm suffering for now. However, considering I never go anywhere without at least a shaman to max out my STA, I'm commonly around 4k HP with fully buffed stats and  minor HP buffs. Virtue on top of that and I easily break 5k. Not too bad....<br />
<br />
Sorry to drift off-topic a bit, but unless your equipment can last you until you can manage to get ornate or raid drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">12-16-2003, 05:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hell, you're almost the same ac/hps as me at 62.  Most slots look pretty good.  I'd look for a better bow, or for something I could swap out with one when I'm not pulling.  Other than that, I'd say you're pretty much set.  There are a couple of things you could easily upgrade, but most of them would only be for items that might be 1 or 2 points better in a given stat.  From here on you're probably going to bet getting most of your upgrades from raiding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neksnappa</div><div class="date">12-16-2003, 06:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You mention that your arms are probably your weakest slot, and I'd say that buying ornate arms, or any slots you can get for cheap, would be great. You only need to be level 55 to get ornate, as long as you buy the pattern.<br />
<br />
Also, 245 unbuffed STA is a bit of a waste. Granted, most of your items have raw hp in addition to the stamina, but some slots are relatively cheap &quot;upgrades&quot; to give less raw stam, but more raw hp. You'll lose a few unbuffed HP overall, but will benefit more from shammy buffs. One good example is a Crinoose (Sp?) Cape of the Werewolf. You might be able to trade your maelstrom for it, and youll gain raw hp, and be almost 20 stone lighter also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Malikae</div><div class="date">12-16-2003, 08:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd say while you have alot of hps for you're level, you might want to put a little more emphasis on AC than stamina. Right now, even the weakest stamina buff is going to max you out, and since you box with a 65 shammy, its EASILY maxed.  <br />
<br />
LOL i love how CoF and Ornate is talked about like its in stock and cheap. CoF on Inny is like 80k on a good day, and ornate is either 100k+ or not there. This warrior doesnt have that :P</div></div><hr />

rest is damn good.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I thank you all for the suggestions, and it appears that I have to go on the raid route for improvement.  So that means a guild and things.  Ah well, it will build character!<br />
