I have never been a warrior before and was wondering if what I have was good for my lvl and till what lvl it good for.  I currently have in my primary *blade of the arisian cultist* and secondary *centi short sword* .  Are there other weps I should look into getting?<br />
<br />
<br />
*my magelo is not complete, all slots are filed I just have to add them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">06-10-2003, 02:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Posts like this always amuse me.  I was using langseaxes at lvl 19, and damned glad to have them.  Not a flame, I just think it's funny when I see someone who's relatively low level and who has weapons that drop in 50+ zones asking &quot;Are these good for my level?&quot;  :)  Don't know what the stats are on cultist blade, but centi SS should be good from a DPS perspective until about level 50, but by then you'll want something with a proc for aggro purposes when MT'ing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">06-10-2003, 02:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Those weapons are fine for your level and for a while yet. Make sure you keep your other skills up though and dont just concentrate on 1hs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frodlin7th</div><div class="date">06-10-2003, 02:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's the thing...<br />
<br />
From 1-20 you have if I'm not mistaken... a damage cap of 30 points per successful hit.  You have no damage bonus in the mainhand.   So, what you would look for before level 20 for REAL Min/Maxing is the fastest weapon that can hit that damage cap.<br />
<br />
From 20 to about 40ish, oh.. 45 ish is where stupid twink warriors make their biggest errors.   They think that they can grab a lamentation and that it's actually a good weapon, or that they can grab some low delay weapon and it's meaningful.   <br />
<br />
It's not.   <br />
<br />
Until you reach a damage bonus of around 10, your BEST bet is to get the highest damage weapon you can get hold of with the lowest delay you can find... in THAT order of importance and buff up your Atk via Strength and +atk (i.e. Gobbie Earring and Woven Giant Beards).<br />
<br />
It's not until you actually get a consistent damage bonus with mainhand that low delay weapons become meaningful.  Keep right clicking that 1h weapon that you have, when the damage bonus is 10... then you should start using the low delay stuff.  Until then, high damage &gt; low delay</div></div><hr />

<br />
those 2 weapons are 50+ levels useful; at the minimum.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chebbie</div><div class="date">06-12-2003, 10:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am a level 31 warrior.<br />
I have a shaded blade, and a centi shortsword which I use most of the time.<br />
I have kept up my pierce, and use crystaline spider fang and a pine shaft pike, or the centi warspear.<br />
For 2HS, I have the mithrill two handed. (nice)<br />
<br />
I have been slack in not keeping up my 1H and 2H blunt skills. I have a Cane of Tranquility for 1HB<br />
<br />
I read in this forum that there is a need to keep 2HB maxxed. What would you suggest I should get for 2HB?<br />

Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">06-12-2003, 11:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">An easy way to keep your skills maxed is to make sure you have your primary and sec slots and a couple of inventory slots hotkeyed in your hotkey bank. then you can swop in and out of weapons mid fight without having to open ur inventory. Some of the new UIs out there have customised inventory slots which allow this easily, so you may want to consider getting a UI if you havent already got one.<br />
<br />
Also, no point having 2 1hs weps. Keep one in primary, then rotate a 1hp or a 1hb in your secondary. That will ensure that you get skill ups across the board. If you find any skill lagging behind, put that wep into primary for a bit.</div></div><hr />

probabally cheaper than your cane is a Blackjack or Smouldering Brand ( bit faster too ); and for 2H blunt training try for a Ketchaka Koro Mis; or for free the ol' reliable Abandoned Orc Shovel from Lake Rathe.<br />
<br />
Just don't plan on doing much MT work with the 2H'ers :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donnel</div><div class="date">06-12-2003, 12:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looked at your magelo...<br />
<br />
Keep the weapons you have, just swap hands on em. <br />
<br />
Put the 23 delay 11 dam in off hand (I know 2 delay lower isn't much, but faster is faster, and dual weild will go up more)<br />
<br />
Put the 12 dam, 25 delay in primary. you want the 12 damage to hit more often then you want the 11 damage to. More damage is more damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">06-12-2003, 12:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My only lagging weapon skill is 2h blunt, because I could never find/afford a good enough 2h blunt weapon to make me put away the slashers I was using for long enough to skill up.  I picked up a sarnak battlehammer in the bazaar for about 50-75pp the other day.  If I'm not mistaken it's 30/40, no stats.  Not great, but the ratio is good enough for me to actually consider using it when I'm not MT. :)<br />

Beo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tugurok</div><div class="date">06-12-2003, 12:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't understand why any 20-45 warrior just doesn't get a wurmslayer. Cheap and powerful. Offhand many solid choices: jarsath trident, jagged long sword, lsom, etc. I don't get why so many people focus on centi shortswords and centi longswords.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">06-12-2003, 12:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">heh yeah. wurmy is solid damage up to 45. <br />
<br />
for a good fast 2hb i know the stormwood battle staff in OS is quite fast. Also someone recommended somewhere else theres a 2hb that drops in the fort in BW whic has a delay of 30. Cant remember the name, but thats pretty quick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hormadrune</div><div class="date">06-12-2003, 01:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Poison Wind Censor is 20/28. Very good for skillups as long as you're careful about the AoE proc (3x122 poison damage and the weap has a nasty PR reduction to boot :P). Runs anywhere from 750p to 2k on my server at least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Friedrick</div><div class="date">06-12-2003, 01:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I too neglected 2hb for a long time since there was a lack of decent cheap 2hb then.  What I did was camp a mithril staff in LOIO at the time.  Then, I would use 2hs until the mob started running and then swap it in.  Lots of swings and no aggro worries.  Might consider doing something similar.  Another option is asking a group if they mind if you practice a weapon skill on their mobs.  You get skill ups, their mob dies faster, everyone is happy.<br />
<br />
The 2hb from the giant fort in Burning Woods is called a Bronzewood staff (10/26 procs stun) iirc.<br />
<br />
*edit*<br />
P.S.  Thank you Frodlin for not spewing the usual &quot;fastest mainhand, best ratio offhand&quot; mantra without applying common sense to it.  According to most people, you should mainhand a Lamentation (fastest) and offhand Blade of Carnage (best ratio), heheh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chebbie</div><div class="date">06-12-2003, 04:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Umm, what a level 50 - 65 considers cheap is way out of reach of a level 30.<br />
I spent weeks collecting iron oxide, fine steel swords, etc, to make just 700pp. That is the most I have ever had in my hands.<br />
I bought the centi shortsword because of the price. The shaded blade was given to me by a kind unknown warrior in blue armor.<br />
Spending 1k on one weapon will come later. Much, much later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">06-12-2003, 04:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tugurok is right on the money.  From 20 to about 45 a wurmslayer is hard to beat.  After that, you'll want a faster weapon so that your damage bonus is applied more often.  Before you get a good damage bonus, it's all about ratio, and wurmslayer actually has a better ration than a lammy, believe it or not.<br />
