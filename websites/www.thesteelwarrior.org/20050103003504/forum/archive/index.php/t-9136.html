<br />
It had all the info I needed. This is what I did.<br />
<br />
Fusible Igneous Ore - <br />
Got a port to skyfire, ran around forever finding the loc, finally found it. Top of a giant lava filled crater. Tons on the ground, your pic. Get port out.<br />
<br />
Fusible Velium Ore - <br />
Port to CS, succor through SG. A friend went with me boxing his 63 shaman and ranger. Ranger Tracked Guardian Kozzalym and we killed him. Ranger plinking arrows and me tanking. Went down easy. While we were there ranger tracked Makil Rargon so I could get the combine piece. He was inside some giant Ice thing. Watch for wandering mobs near him. (Guardian wonders, good to have a tracker)<br />
<br />
Fusible Coral Ore - <br />
I went exploring on my warrior first and found phinny not up so I camped her at safe spot and logged druid. Druid got phinny on track and so I had my 65 cleric friend come and help me. We wiped the first time due to 2 adds because we went straight down instead of edging in from the sides and my druid was tanking without an EB item. We got him to 7% before cleric died. Our second try went flawless. Grabbed Lodi shield of warrior and memed the right spells, he was toast. Looted Ore. Don't worry about buffs, he dispells. &quot;You have been very dispelled.&quot; Fun. <br />
<br />
Fusible Earthen Ore - <br />
There was a thread floating around somewhere on how to get this without having to kill Gots. Same cleric da'd and jumped down. Friend boxed a bard for da jump and then camped to bring his 51 necro for pulls. Also had same ranger and he used his friends shaman. Everything was fine till ranger got 3 adds and we had to deal with those, ranger only one to die. Rezzed and beat down other garg and got my last piece.<br />
<br />
