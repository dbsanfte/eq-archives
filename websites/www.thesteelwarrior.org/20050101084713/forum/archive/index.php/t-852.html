I have done this camp twice the first one took 2 hours and then the second one took 13. I dont wish this camp on anyone its so damn boring. <br />
<br />
It is not the timer you have to worry about though, its some punk trying to KS it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">05-27-2003, 01:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye, 18 hour timer, that he does skip.  Spawns near the 3 gnomes playing some form of game.  Be ready to put out a lot of damage fast, as there is a good chance that there will be multiple people ready to ks you (2 sk's sat next to me when I did it, openly admitting they were going to attempt to outdamage me even though I had been there hours before either one of them).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Roughbeard</div><div class="date">05-27-2003, 04:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Stressful camp trying to get rid of all the KSers! Had a druid-bot trying to KS me for his monk who was in NToV or something.. had a SK there also.. Rogue there too.. 3 Other warriors.. and then everyone thought he skipped the spawn and left.. and lo and behold 5 mins later my level 48 (was 49, got killed trying to kill him :p) Looted the last piece needed :D <br />
<br />
So yeah.. 18 Hours +/- some.. skips a ton.. farm couger claw earrings or something.. but it is the most boring camp i have ever done. i have given up camping anything now, if its not up when im there its not worth camping. <br />

For some reason though, I remember hearing they removed the skipping spawn thing from Lodzial and Stormfeather.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Stormfeather is teh debil!<br />
<br />
As much as I want the Eyepatch for my rogue I will NEVER step foot in Iceclad again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Forgot to add that he will never skip more than 2 spawns in a row so his max spawn time from last killing is 56 hours.</div></div><hr />
