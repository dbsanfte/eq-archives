<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kaledan</div><div class="date">10-31-2003, 03:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Found this (groups.google.com search 'beetmi') on the google usenet archive, thought it might be of interest to some people, especially those who put a lot of faith in displayed AC as being a meaningful guide to how well you take damage:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
As an experiment, to examine the relationship between an EQ char's<br />
displayed &quot;AC&quot; stat and actual combat results I created a L1<br />
Human Paladin and provided him with a Finesteel Shortsword, a<br />
Large Lanter, and a full suit of Banded Armor.  Our hero's<br />
stats are str85, sta100, agi75, dex75, wis80, int75, cha85.<br />
The key stat here is AGI, which I wanted at the &quot;norm&quot; where<br />
there are no bonuses or penalties.<br />
<br />
For Beetmi's first mission as an armor test pilot, I sent him to<br />
East Freeport were there is a Soulbinder and an almost always<br />
empty newbie yard.  A very nice additional feature of EFP for my<br />
test is that &quot;a fire beetle&quot; is always a L2 mob (I have conned<br />
easily over a hundred of these with various lowbies over the<br />
last 2-1/2 years, always yellow to L1, even to L2, blue to L3<br />
thru L5).  I &quot;fought&quot; one or more &quot;a fire beetle&quot;s to 13 of my<br />
own deathss, and killed a couple besides.  I mostly just let them<br />
kill me, using Lay Hands to prolong the agony, in order to get<br />
a fairly large number of attacks logged.  For these first results,<br />
Beetmi had a Defense Skill ranging from 1 to 3, giving a displayed<br />
AC ranging from 154 to 160.  He was hit 650 times for 1234 damage<br />
(1.90 avg per hit) with 177 misses (21.40% misses), for a net<br />
damage per attack of 1.49.<br />
<br />
Next, our hero was permitted to &quot;test&quot; his shortsword for a while.<br />
Once he was L4 with his Defense skill maxed at 20 he was sent back<br />
to EFP to engage some &quot;a fire beetle&quot;s again.  This time he was<br />
sent in naked, with a displayed AC of 59.  He was hit 296 times<br />
for 1078 damage (3.64 avg. per hit) with 404 misses (57.71% misses),<br />
for a net damage per attack of 1.54.<br />
<br />
To recap, comparing an &quot;AC&quot; of over 153 derived almost entirely from<br />
armor to an &quot;AC&quot; of precisely 59 that was entirely intrinsic I saw<br />
dramatic changes in the chance of &quot;a fire beetle&quot; to score a hit<br />
and to the average damage per hit, with less than a 5% difference<br />
in the average damage per attack between the two test cases.<br />
<br />
I seems to me that this easily recreated test demonstrates quite<br />
clearly that your displayed AC cannot be considered a &quot;stat&quot; by<br />
any reasonable definition.  &quot;AC&quot; is nothing more nor less than a<br />
rough guide to your passive melee defensive capability computed<br />
in a way that differs substantially from the mechanics used in<br />
EQ to resolve melee combat. The evidence suggests a two-step<br />
combat reolution in which the chance of an enemy scoring a hit is<br />
affected primarily by your Defense skill while the amount of damage<br />
done by a hit can be mitigated by your armor.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kaledan</div><div class="date">10-31-2003, 04:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">And a follow-up from the same thread:<br />
<br />
<br />
Aonalin, secretly known to himself as Beetlfuud, volunteered<br />
to test the The Emperor's New Armor (tm) at L1.  Added to<br />
the results produced by valiant cousin Beetmi we now have<br />
a somewhat more detailed picture of the effect of armor<br />
and Defense skill on combat.<br />
<br />
Both characters are human paladins, they wear no jewelry,<br />
carry no shield, have no buffs cast on them, and are either<br />
naked or wearing full banded armor.  character stats are:<br />
str85, sta100, agi75, dex75, wis80, int75, cha85<br />
<br />
The following tables show Defense skill, displayed AC, and<br />
the results of attacks on the characters.  All reported<br />
attacks are by &quot;a fire beetle&quot; a L2 warrior-type mob that<br />
scores 1 to 6 damage on a sucessful hit.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Armored results:<br />
Def     AC        Hit    Miss   Hit%   Dmg/Hit   Dmg/Atk<br />
----   --------   ----   ----   ----   -------   -------<br />
20     201         480    617   43.8     1.47      0.64<br />
1..3   154..160    650    177   78.6     1.90      1.49<br />
<br />
Naked results:<br />
Def     AC        Hit    Miss   Hit%   Dmg/Hit   Dmg/Atk<br />
----   --------   ----   ----   ----   -------   -------<br />
20      59         296    404   42.3     3.64      1.54<br />
0..5    10...21    387    104   78.8     4.23      3.34<br />
<br />
<br />
As you can see, there is no substantial change in hit%<br />
between naked and armored for equal/similar Defense skill.<br />
There appears to be a significant reduction in Dmg/Hit<br />
associated with increased Defense skill.  And there is a<br />
very large decrease in Dmg/Hit shown when the character<br />
dons armor.<br />
<br />
Comparing the Armored Def (1..3) results to the Naked<br />
Def (20) results is especially instructive.  In light<br />
of this I see no value at all in comparing displayed<br />
AC between two characters unless their Defense skill<br />
is near identical.  It's pretty clear that displayed AC<br />
is pure eye-candy and does not enter into combat<br />
calculations.<br />
<br />
Below is a further breakdown of the Naked results for<br />
low Defense skill.  You will see here a noticeable<br />
decrease in Dmg/Hit associated with a relatively small<br />
increase in Defense skill.  Note that the difference is<br />
very close to 1/2 the difference between Defense (0..2)<br />
and Defense (20).  Although seeing half of the change<br />
in Dmg/Hit ocur over a fairly small portion of the skill<br />
is not inconsistent with the many reports of large changes<br />
in effectiveness when moving through &quot;sweet spots&quot; in<br />
various areas of the game mechanics, the relatively small<br />
samples (248 and 243 attacks in the two groups) keep me<br />
from giving too much weight to this given the notorious<br />
streakiness of the EQ random number generator.  Still,<br />
I find that interpretation of these numbers far more<br />
believeable than the conspiracy theorists &quot;level&quot; mantra<br />
(I simply cannot imagine what they think Defense skill<br />
does, to keep bleating about &quot;level&quot;, especially when I<br />
know of no indication from Verant or other informed<br />
sources ever that level per se affects passive melee<br />
defense).<br />
<br />

Broken-down Naked results for Defense (0..5):<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">10-31-2003, 07:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I seem to recall, from a few years ago, a post by a monk who was retiring from EQ for good.  He delevelled himself from near 60 to level 8 or so.  At level 8, with his still-maxed skills, he was able to solo level 30 aviak avocets with ease.  The obvious implication was that it is your melee skills that determine your melee performance, rather than your level.<br />
<br />
When people refer to melee performance at a given player level, you should interpret that as meaning &quot;with maximum skills for that level&quot;.  However, this breaks down at level 61-65: melee offensive and defensive performance definitely change at these levels, and yet our skill numbers do not.  Evidently special cases were coded into the melee engine for the POP expansion.  So it is inaccurate to say that skills are all that matter in the post-POP era.</div></div><hr />

No, they do not.  I wish I would have parsed the DPS my warrior takes in BoT. I leveled him in bot almost exclusively from 60-65 with very little change in his gear. He actually has slightly lower AC now thta I have gotten a few nice HP upgrade items. I can tell you that the difference in his tanking ability from level 60 to 65 has certainly changed, even before I started getting AA. He took considerably more healing at lower levels.</div></div><hr />

To me these indicate that, beyond damage table increases and damage bonus increases, I didn't do better damage or tank better.  No where NEAR the difference you would see going from 55-60.  <br />
<br />
Of course my defensive avg hits on the goblins are pretty messy due to the fact that I wasn't tanking all the time and pulled with stone stance a lot.  <br />
<br />
If there are increases, then it is incredibly small.  On the order of single percentages more than likely.  ( (250 + 65)/(250 + 60) perhaps?  )  At any rate, I highly doubt anyone that says they tanked noticeably better going from 60-65.</div></div><hr />

You can't say that there was no increase in your defensive capabilites by changing expansions midway through the test.  Anything in PoP puts out significantly more dps than trash mobs in ssra (not counting DC mobs, of course).  I also find it hard to believe that you didn't change one single piece of equipment from level 60 to level 65, although I suppose it ~could~ happen.</div></div><hr />

Yes, your max hit will go up on lvls 61, 63, 64, and 65.  I don't know why it went up on lvl 62.  But at 61 and 64 your damage bonus increases.  At 63 and 65 you get a damage table increase.<br />

I would compare the damage taken at 60, 61 and 62 against the taskmaster to say I didn't tank better by leveling.  I would also compare the damage taken at 62, 63, and 64 by a hobgoblin to say that I didn't tank better by leveling.  I wouldn't try to compare between the two different mobs.<br />
<br />
I was also the second monk to 65 on my server.  I was in a raid guild in mid Velious (Left just before Emp was killed on our server.) so I was well equipped when I came back, and I didn't raid till I was 65 so there were no items available to me that I could upgrade until I started raiding agian. <br />
<br />
I am just saying we have no hard evidence to support that you take damage or deal damage any better just through levels other than the increase in damage bonus and beter offensive tables.  Both of which are minor increases.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hyardgune</div><div class="date">11-03-2003, 02:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, having little or no change in armor from 60-65 is not far fetched at all.  I think I changed only 3 pieces in that time.<br />
<br />
Sassinak, 2h damage bonus does scale up each level from 60 to 65, so the 2 point increase on max hits per level is normal.<br />
<br />
I'd say that Brodda's parses are a good indicator that monks at least gain no defensive improvements by levelling 60-65.  As SOE has certainly shown no great interest in warriors, it seems likely that warriors also gain no defensive benefits from levelling.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It seemed like to me that I took less damage as I levelled from 60-65, but I don't have any parses. 59-60 was very noticable. I would think the &quot;whole my level vs. their level&quot; thing plays a part in it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">11-03-2003, 08:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't have any parses either sadly, but I started tanking in PoV at level 59 and at that point one of the guild clerics considered me &quot;a challenge&quot; to heal.  He pretty much had to chain supernal light to keep me up.  By the time I was 65 (couple weeks later) I could group there with a shaman as the only slower/healer with no problem.  I'm almost sure I couldn't have done that at 59.  I did get at least one item (VT earring) during this time, but it wasn't long so I don't think I got major gear upgrades that would have made that much difference.   <br />
<br />
One thing to consider might be that the snake in Ssra was (I assume) blue to you both at 60 and 65, where the golems in PoV conned yellow (or maybe even red but I think they max out at 61) to me at 59 and were a few levels into the blue by 65.  Also I think it is safe to assume you were above the luclin AC soft cap both before and after.  It makes no sense whatsoever though that your average hit went up when you leveled from 61 to 62 or from 63 to 64, which kind of indicates that your sample size might be too small or there is some other factor that we're not seeing.  This is a hard thing to parse obviously, since most of us aren't willing to delevel to 60 in the name of science :p.<br />
<br />
C'mon, one of you guys with max AA can do this for us right? :cool:</div></div><hr />

Yeah, so I don't think it will ever be resolved.<br />
<br />
It makes no sense whatsoever though that your average hit went up when you leveled from 61 to 62 or from 63 to 64<br />
not from 61-62 it doesnt, but I think 62 is just statistical error.  I spend far more time at 62 in PoN than Ssra.  However, at 64 your damage bonus increases which would increase your average hit.<br />
<br />
I was expecting to see something from those logs that showed a significant increase.  People from the monk boards were claiming 20% incrase in damage and tanking far better.  But my logs sure don't show that.</div></div><hr />

I was referring to the mobs average hit on you going up, just to clarify.  Didn't go up by much, probably well within the margin of error.</div></div><hr />
