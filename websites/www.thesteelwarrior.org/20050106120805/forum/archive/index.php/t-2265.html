<br />
Here is my problem, vah shir get gimped on cutral(sp?) heraldic and just about anything else.(this is kinda bull**** to me, even the GD frogs got in on heraldic, they never thought to lend a hand to the forced agnostic)<br />
<br />
where the ruddy hell can i get some upgrades? moktor is even better than my crap at this point :(<br />
<br />
(and i refuse to start a new warrior)<br />
<br />
faederya? ideas?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Taking a blind shot..<br />
<br />
Grab some friends ( or a guild ) and farm champions armor or hot. That should be somewhat better. If you have access to Tier 3 planes, get in some groups and pray some ornate drops. <br />
<br />
You mentioned Moktor is better, that's an easy to aquire set of armor with just 3/4 people.  <br />
<br />
I've always been a poor lil elf, so I had to rely on drops basically. Dunno what is out there to buy besides non cultural which you can't wear.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sangiovese</div><div class="date">07-30-2003, 02:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Really need to know what you're wearing in order to give upgrade advice... and more importantly, what sort of mobs are within your reach (or how much cash you have to spend).<br />
<br />
Failing that, I would have to say that Bloodheart was right on the money with this advice...<br />
<br />
Grab some friends ( or a guild ) and farm champions armor or hot.<br />
<br />
Champs and myrmidion armor served me well for a long time (and I'm still wearing a couple pieces).<br />
<br />
If magelo ever comes back up, you can see how this Vah Shir warrior is making out.  I'm not in an uber guild (biggest kills to date are Agnarr and Mith. Marr) but I sit around 1460 ac and 8250 HPs fully buffed (no Vex Thal gear yet).  Lack of cultural armor stinks, but it's a small price to pay for lookin' as dead sexay as I do :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Garoar</div><div class="date">07-30-2003, 02:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well Gerick as a Vah Shir I feel your pain we're gimpled in ohh so many ways large size race still get stunned, HAVE TO be agnostic get no special armor. but dont give up.. we're unique, no idea what you have now, sounds like your in bad gear dont even know your level or anything that could help,but if your 60+ area and have a grp of friends hit Kael and do the plate cycle I believe its #11 on EQAtlas Kael map, part of the 9th coldain ring quest. walk up to the dorf and say , &quot;The Dain shall be slain for the peace we must obtain&quot; slap the dorf once then it starts the quest, 2 giants at a time will attack and then the dorf comes out last kill em loot his head for 9th ring, repops are fast and drops are decent - should be able to land a few pieces of Thrug Plate in one night. its a start..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wratth</div><div class="date">07-30-2003, 02:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Plate house(Kael) is easy if you know what you are doing (lost my info on it sorry have not done in over a year) and drops allot of plate. <br />
<br />
Also this armor is slighty better than RZ human cultural armor.<br />
<br />
Still prob not what you want for 65 mobs.<br />
<br />
If you are in groups of 65s hunt down various ornate armor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dont be discrouraged too much bout being a kitty.  And having limited armor selections.  Just means you gotta work a little harder.  <br />
<br />
Velious quest stuff is a start, you can look into the Tae Ew plate armors, they are quite nice for some of the slots, and if all else fails, try to buy a few ornate molds (62+ or Teir 3 flag).</div></div><hr />

Oh, and Magelo is back up... for the time being...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">07-30-2003, 09:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">my main concern is that im am still using royal engraved velium BP and leggings, as well as a hero bracer and a bracer of scavanging<br />
<br />
bp is only 32 ac 20( i think) hp<br />
legs are 19 ac no hp</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cenyen</div><div class="date">07-30-2003, 09:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">you haven't helped us though, we need to know money able to spent, current gear(all slots), and how many friends you can get to help you with the gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hyardgune</div><div class="date">07-30-2003, 10:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was doing a Cobalt/Indicolite mix at 65, which takes pathetic to unbelievable lows.  Trust me, you can survive.<br />
<br />
Moktor isn't hard to get but the drop rates suck.  HoT would likely be your best bet.  Thurg will do ok and yeah, it isn't too hard to get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wulfran</div><div class="date">07-30-2003, 11:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you have a load of cash, the ornate pieces are coming available after the last patch, as well. On Veeshan, gaunts are running around 25K, vambrances 40K and helms 35K. If you can afford that, then you're off to the races. Otherwise, go do the Thurg/HoT thing. Also some of the player crafted elemental gear is hitting the market now too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">faederya</div><div class="date">07-30-2003, 12:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just do the typical Velious+ progression.<br />
- Gear in Thurg, move to HoT, then either WToV or Ornate.<br />
<br />
- If your not in a guild with average 24 folks online then youll probably either have to buy Ornate or stop at Thurg or move slowly through HoT.<br />
<br />
You can try to gather smithing components in Cazic Thule for Tae We legs or fight in Veksar for some Kylong legs, there ok.  Nightmare armor is ok... You can gather the smithing components with one group.<br />
<br />
There's always the possiblity that you just won't be able to hunt/exp in PoP Tier 2+ without massive down time or deaths.  That's not a bad thing.  Even in Thurg gear you can have tons of fun in UP, Droga, CT, DN, SG, Nadox, and I am assuming new LDoN. <br />
<br />
You don't have to have 8k/1450ac buffed to tank well and have fun with your friends.  Yes, it is kinda &quot;tuff&quot; to not have cultural but it was kinda &quot;challenging&quot; for me when my warrior friends were wearing Heraldic and I fought and tore and scratched my way to some better armor.<br />
<br />
Im a cat, started day Luclin moon was discovered.  Guild has about 20-30 folks on at a time that do &quot;raid&quot; and usually only 2-4 &quot;raids&quot; a week.  We mainly work on epics cause there still fun for us, bleieve it or not.  We are still doing the EQ progression, we are finishing Velious zones and moving into Luclin/PoP minis.   I'm quiet happy with my 1400ac, 7.6k buffed catness.  I worked hard with out being able to use cultural and I am very proud of my agnostic belief....</div></div><hr />

I SOOO agree, was a while there i was extremely pisssed due to agnostic geting screwed, and well being half elf doesnt help much either heh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">07-30-2003, 11:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">basicly we get screwed for not kissing some gods ass that im about to go kill in a raid &lt;laugh&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">07-30-2003, 11:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i can make 5k in a day btw, so i can farm a nice bit of money using band aids, i would put up manglo but it doesnt work with my fire wall and that its been down for 5 days or so</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cenyen</div><div class="date">07-31-2003, 12:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Do yourself a favor and go to Grachnist in WW for one day.<br />
<br />
He is a level ~30 mob who drops the grim aura clicky earring which sells for 3-6k. They are not lore, or weren't when i camped them. Grachnist himself is not a rare spawn, had 2 pop in same spawn rotation many times. Bring embalming skinning knife and/or a bloodpoint or 2 though, the mobs will eventually wear you down, you have to clear the whole fort</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">uhrlik</div><div class="date">07-31-2003, 01:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My Iksar SK needed Grachnist's head for a Dreadscale armor quest and had to camp that fort. You can expect to go through a lot of Grach's before he drops a single earring, and he's not at all rare. I saw 3 or 4 of them up at the same time.</div></div><hr />
