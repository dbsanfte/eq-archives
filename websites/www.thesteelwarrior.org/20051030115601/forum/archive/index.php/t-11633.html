<br />
    * Deathwish - Is now usable while under a Fear effect, which will also remove the Fear effect.<br />
    * Overpower - Fixed a bug where the ability was sometimes blocked.<br />
    * Improved Cleave - Now increases damage bonus by 40/80/120%.<br />
    * Blood Craze - Talent design changed. It now regenerates 1/2/3% of the warrior's total health over 6 seconds after being the victim of a critical strike.<br />
    * New Fury Talent: Dual Wield Specialization - Increases damage with the off-hand weapon by 5/10/15/20/25%. Note: the additional damage also increases rage generation significantly.<br />
    * Iron Will - Fixed a bug that caused many abilities to ignore the additional resistance.<br />
    * Enrage - Increased the number of charges to 12. Decreased the duration to 12 seconds. The new duration is the limiting factor for slower weapons (e.g. Arcanite Reaper will typically get one less swing), while dual wielding and faster weapons will make better use of all of the charges over the duration of the ability.<br />
    * Concussion Blow - Changed to an instant, stunning attack and removed the damage portion.<br />
    * Shield Specialization - In addition to increasing % chance to block, it now gives the warrior a 20/40/60/80/100% chance to generate 1 rage on a successful block. <br />

No wonder I never saw it light up.<br />

As for protection help, concussion being instant is nice.  Other than that though, not sure how those two changes significantly help protection in PvP.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaylos</div><div class="date">05-12-2005, 07:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The block ragge pretty much cancels some of the cost of using the shield block skill by 1 rage normal, 2 rage with 2 blocks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaylos</div><div class="date">05-12-2005, 08:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wait a minute, concussion blow does weapon damage + stun.  So its a fee attack for damage purposes.  I would think that helps some for protection warrior, especially with the one hand spec, switch to dual weild as you use your concussion blow and wail away for 5 seconds, maybe even throwing in a HS.  A protection warrior could do a good but of damage in that 5 seodns while dual weilding.<br />
<br />
The real question is where DW spec is going to fall on the Fury tree.  If its low enough to get with Protection, a protection warrior would really be able to dish out the damage then while using DW.  Of course the problem with that is that TM as a class definig talent and no one would give that up.</div></div><hr />

Removed all agi, +crit, +to hit and added +def, +block, +dodge.  It is a nice change, I guess, for doing more PvE.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rebirth</div><div class="date">05-12-2005, 09:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So is fury going to be stereotypically DW?  Or can the slow 2h Fury wars still/will be able to  pull their weight?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaylos</div><div class="date">05-12-2005, 09:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think with the changes, you should use DW with fury, and keep a slow 2h to start fights off with a strong attack and WW.  Also, bloodthirst needs a slow 2H to get most out of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">05-12-2005, 11:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">furry tree was already rather full of talents, and they even added more to it... really dumb, should have fused some of them.<br />
<br />
btw, the blood craze modif is probably the best change they made :(</div></div><hr />

When I fight other melee classes I use shield block alot and the rage generation from that and from CB being instant will help.</div></div><hr />
