<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frax</div><div class="date">01-08-2004, 09:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Last night our guild cleared phase 1 and instead of the expected phase2, the rest of the zone was empty. Not a single phase spawned.  My guess is that someone, somehow got into another guilds instance and then was on our raid, OR someone from another guild was sitting in potimeb when we zoned in and we got stuck into their instance.   <br />
<br />
 I don't believe anything was done maliciously, as the three guilds in time do not conflict and we have a rotation that has been in place for over a month now, no one really gains anything by messing with the other guilds instances.  The other two guilds had cleared phase1-Quarm each within the last 5 days.<br />
<br />
Will simply waiting a week reset our 'time flags' so that we can start with a fresh instance?</div></div><hr />

But we started fresh tonight and everything was just fine.  GM's didnt do anything that we know of.  Must have just been some strange bug.</div></div><hr />

We are on a three guild rotation, and we haven't touched Time for 9 days.  No one in the zone but us, everyone in the same raid, no joy.  Tried zoning out, reforming, etc..  <br />
<br />
GM eventually showed, said something about a known issue, apparently they will be patching this crap, hopefully soon.<br />
<br />
Yay, lets hear it for almost a full year of flagging and reflagging so we can sit on our asses for 2 hours at a non functional zone in.  :mad:</div></div><hr />

Dev told GM, GM came and reset the instance. I heard that if you send a beta enabled character into Phase 1,  you will NOT spawn a new (or your) instance, but you will respawm the last instance that was active (ie: the guild that was in there before you).<br />

P.S. Hi Darnik :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
I guess we'd probably wait so that we don't get burned again until next weekend. :/  thats two complete weeks of time hosed for us, and we  just had Inno and Quarm left to learn.</div></div><hr />

Contact a GM, to reset your instance, on every single char.  <br />
they wont do that?<br />
<br />
After 9 days, your char loses his PoTime instance flag. so basically skip time for 10 days.</div></div><hr />

Need a GM admin, but they'll do it. <br />
<br />
Waiting 10 days, or until time resets works also.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wonder if they patched again last night after we left =/</div></div><hr />

not sure, maybe 8:30-9pm est? somewhere close to that</div></div><hr />

Solusek Ro deffinetly got reset by 7p EST.  And today a 2nd guild is in an instance other then our own from last night.  Prior to yesturday 3 guilds were all in the same instance.  I guess we'll see tonight that we return to our instance from yesturday rather then join the other instance that was created today...</div></div><hr />

<br />
We start our latest trip to time (still in a three guild rotation).  First several tries at zoning in don't work, so we have everyone on the raid try, finally one person gets in.  We clear Phase 1, and yay, we are in someone else's instance.  But we aren't in the instance of the previous guild to do Time, but the one before that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frax</div><div class="date">01-23-2004, 09:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guild is still bugged as of Thursday, we haven't tried again as of yet, officers were discussing this with a GM on thursday, and supposedly they were doing some testing on a different server last night to fix the problem. No word as of yet the results or if there was even any testing.<br />
<br />
19 days and counting ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lanolar</div><div class="date">01-23-2004, 09:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is pathetic. Its been 3 weeks now and its still not fixed. A new expansion is coming out and they are ignoring a HUUUUUGE damn problem in POP. If they cant even fix the damn instancing in POP, how can we have any faith in GoD instancing? We cant, can we?<br />
<br />
Fix this shit SOE. This is not what I am paying for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grongl</div><div class="date">01-23-2004, 01:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The way it's seemed to us is almost like the zone will only allow two instances at a time.<br />
<br />
Guild A goes, doesn't get past VZ.<br />
<br />
Guild B goes, clears.<br />
<br />
Guild C (us) goes, gets Guild A's instance with only VZ up.  Guild C has to wait til Guild A's instance expires (rotation rules etc.).  Instance finally ends, we clear.<br />
<br />
Repeat that 3-4x and you have our experiences of the past 3-4 rotations.  Guild B hasn't had a problem yet that we've heard of.  We've ended up having to wait 6-7 days between clears to get a new instance.  It's getting kind of absurd.<br />
<br />
This is motherlode, glory hole, pot of gold, candyland, etc. endgame zone right now.  It shouldn't be this fucked up and damn well shouldn't be this fucked up for this long.  SoE needs to suck it up and fix it.  They should probably just make it a true instanced zone instead of the hybrid mess it is now.</div></div><hr />

- Phase 5 Fighting Innoruk (last one up)<br />
- Zone Crashes (not available when you try to relog)<br />
- Zone Up<br />
<br />
- Innoruk &amp; Guards are up<br />
- All the other gods are down<br />
- We get a &quot;6h left message&quot; (which means timer didnt reset)<br />
- People that leave Phase5 can not come back (click up)<br />
- People that were waiting to enter zone Phase5 cant (click up)<br />
- No one can enter zone5 exept if was dead or LD there.<br />
<br />
No GM available. I hope this doesnt create 2 instances.<br />
While we do get some crazy 85+ numbers (Full Clear once per Sunday)<br />
2 instances will suck.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On my server we have 3 Guilds in time atm in a Rot. We have just become time flagged. However were not on the same time zone as the other 3 guilds. <br />
<br />
Apparently thou Time can only have 3 instances at once so even thou were on a different time zone we still can't get our own instance without  jumping into someone’s current or cleared instance.<br />
<br />
Has anyone seen any proof of how many instances there can be at one time.<br />
<br />
Thanks - Sorry if this has been answer I have searched everywhere and all I can see is &quot;maybe 24&quot; or maybe 3.<br />
<br />
Any info would be great thanks.<br />

Shouldn't affect your instance but Time being buggy as it is who knows.</div></div><hr />
