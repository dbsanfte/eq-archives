<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>jomorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have just created a warrior and would like to know what is the best progression path for a new warrior.  I have already upto lvl 38 but haven't concentrated on gear as of yet.  My gear is good enough that i can solo tizmaks in GD without any trouble.  I am going to try and create a magelo for him soon.<br />
<br />
At what lvl should I concern myself about improving my gear and what is the best way to do it?  (bazaar, quests, drops, LDON) <br />
<br />
Thanks for your help in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gaspie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">A magelo would help more. Gear wise go for ac, hp, and stamina.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Busstin1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Depending upon your money situation level 55 is a good level to upgrade, Cause that is when you can do the ornate quest  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nezlok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">dont rly worry about quests, pretty much most of em suck unfortunately :( drop wise... well with my 55 ranja i get drops that sell for 100p average, nothing rly amazing either heh.. ldons are great, id concentrate on EF probably.. EF plate armor is 760 (? i think ?) pts each, BB plate armor isnt as good but is fairly decent and only costs 150 pts each.. just do a buncha ldons imo.. check out http://www.cardplace.com/eq/ to see for yourself =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gaspie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Nro has the best plate gear for 1492 points. BB has 10ac augs, 510 points. EF has Anger augs. Sro has ykesha proc augs. You shouldn't worry about points so much at your level, the exp you get is worth it.<br />
<br />
dont rly worry about quests, pretty much most of em suck unfortunately  drop wise At his level he can't do many worth while quests but once he gets higher 50-65 then a bunch of nice quests become available and are worth the horrid drop rates that come along.<br />
<br />
Once you hit, 46, 50, 51, 55, 61, quite a few nice items become equipable or proc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nezlok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">aye, there are a quite a few decent quests out there, but lets face it.. most of em suck. And imo, spending a whole week farming one rare spawn mob that MIGHT drop the item you need isnt too thrilling.. and alot of the quests should be soloable, sheesh.. its like i start looking at a quest, get halfway and see the words 'raid force' and change my mind.. it sux that u need a raid for alot of hte quests, i just wanna solo some that give me a decent reward. The only quests that ive done that ive found rly worth it were: The Natimbi quest for the Mace of Focused Flame (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=54065) and the Fine Cut, Diamond Inlaid Mask (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=9321) .. those were relatively easy, tho the mace took me about 4 hours and had to get into a group of 65s to do it (yet the mobs are lvl 50, sigh :( ) and the mask took about 5 min heh ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gaspie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Strength of the Elements. The hardest part is The Hole. You *could* bring a raid force to kill the guardian as well or you could bring some friends or random people to help fd pull one garg. <br />
<br />
Earring of the Solstice. Easy, combine, run to echo, turn in, ta da.<br />
<br />
Eyepatch of Plunder. Hardest spawn is Stormfeather. He took me 38 hours straight but I am proud to say it rots on my retired ranger.<br />
<br />
Keys? VT key, the quest from hell, but the rewards are amazing. Not all pieces are soloable by every class though.<br />
<br />
You're right, there isn't a huge amount of warrior quests that can be solo'd by a warrior. Maybe you're looking at newbie gear quests or gear far out of your reach. <br />
<br />
I find quests challenging and fun at times. Some spawns can be a pain but the reward is going to be great. Quests are not suppose to be easy. They are suppose to be annoying, make you pissed off, drive you insane, and make you hate them with a passion but in the end you can say you did it and link people your uber item, hell, laugh in their faces too. *taunt taunt*<br />
<br />
If you don't want to put in the effort it takes to do a quest then fine but don't tell others they are not worth doing.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Xebokan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Your current gear is average compared to your level and considering you're light or non-twinked. At around level 45 - 50, you should start looking around better weapons, since you will have a harder time holding aggro. Save for a set of droga weapons if you can.<br />
<br />
In the light of the recent changes to LDoN, I would recommend doing Mistmoore adv. and buy the Death Embracer armour parts at 150 point a piece. This is &quot;free&quot; and can refunded later, should you aquire better armour.<br />
Should you for some reason have lots of plat, you can buy a suit of cultural armour or ornate, if you're very rich.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gaspie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">6ac 65hp rings, 300-400pp each. Will last you all the way till 46 when you can equip valorium rings. Tattered Mantle, 100pp or so. You could go around to all the smithing merchants in the bazaar and pok and try to find gothic steel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">After some head scratching, I'd tend to agree with Xebokan concerning the MM line of really cheap LDoN armor, now that it can be sold back. You'll be able to get a couple of pieces of this before your level gets so high that it's not really level-apropriate.<br />
<br />
The real progression path for warrior gear is to get whatever you can as cheap as you can, lol.<br />
<br />
Write down the stats of all the armor you are wearing now. Go the bazaar &amp; search by slot, race, class, religion and your budget. Scan the possibilities. Seek AC, STA and hitpoints. Buy the best thing you can get for the buck.<br />
<br />
I'd think of it as &quot;layers&quot; of gear classes rather than sending you out for specific armor types. The first layer for you is gothic-frosted-sandblasted + crafted + crustacean. the crusty is the best I think in most spots, but the differences are worth researching. The Gothic stuff should sell for about 100 pp off vendors near forges; the crafted and crusty will be in the bazaar and it just sort of depends what folks are dumping them for. I would imagine 100pp per piece would be a pretty good deal (the gems used in the crafted armor in some cases cost more than that, so if you see someone selling it for that, they ain't making a profit), and some will cost more, but this varies by server and even over time. This stuff would be an upgrade in some slots, but you'll have to replace as much of it as you can almost as soon as you get it.<br />
<br />
Armors like steelwrapped and barbed ringmail are potential bridges between crusty and cultural. Again, price varies, but you're looking at the 2000 plat range.<br />
<br />
Your cultural armor (Helanic Tundra Armor if you are Tribunal), is really nice stuff and will carry you from whenever you can afford it until you can replace it (you can be wearing it at 65 in many slots). This will cost a few thousand plat per piece.<br />
<br />
Some LDoN armor is better than cultural, but you don't really build up LDoN points very fast until you are in your 60s (perhaps you know this already). <br />
<br />
You could potentially upgrade your weapon set up for free by going through Dawnshroud peaks to Maidens Eye. Zone into ME but stay at the zoneline and ask politely that, should a goranga spiked club drop near the zoneline, that you be allowed to loot it. It's no-drop, so people might let you have it. It's primary only, 1HB, 12dam/23delay, er, 5 AC I think. You could then move your short sword into your offhand. Be both polite and careful if you try this, though.<br />
<br />
Good luck</div></div><hr />
