I've been away from these boards for quite a while.  I pretty much quit playing my 57 War in favor of my necro.  So anything new happening in the Warrior world?  Or perhaps to be more specific anything been done to make Warriors more viable?  I was excited to read that &quot;Classes are not that out of balance&quot; so am hoping some changes have been made in the last six months....</div></div><hr />

<br />
Keep playing your necro if you like it.  There's nothing new for warriors lately and nothing new has been announced other than they are not currently working on anything for warriors or pure melee, but 'might someday'.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maelissa</div><div class="date">09-10-2003, 05:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nothing specifically targeted towards Warriors.  However LDoN is a lot more flexible in terms of group composition than PoP is.  Agro lock isn't as critical an issue, so even though warriors are still gimped, they're gimped in a friendler environment.  <br />
<br />
On second thought, one thing that is cool for Warriors in LDoN is there are a number of weapon proc augmentations that can be bought directly with adventure points and added to pretty much any weapon currently in the game.  Since LDoN is supposed to allow multiple procs on a weapon, this could make some good agro weapons.  <br />
<br />
Unfortunately I think, from a game mechanics standpoint, classes are relatively balanced at this time (balanced in the sense of 'all classes are functional at all level ranges'  not balanced in the sense of 'all classes are roughly equal in power and utility').  What's really hitting warriors hardest is player perception of their abilities (at least in exp groups).  In a game like EQ where the game mechanics are hidden as much as possible from the player base, eye candy maneuvers have a disproportionate effect on player's perception of the class's viability.  Paladin's Slay Undead ability is a good example of this.  Even though intensive parsing has repeatedly shown that the ability gives a relatively negligible increase in DPS against undead, the eye candy effects of a 5K slay has given rise to the occasional rumor that its an unbalanced ability.  <br />
<br />
Better agro management is definately a good thing, but what Warriors really need is a couple of eye-candy maneuvers that provide a perceptable benefit without having to be parsed for 6 hours.  Player perception is more of a hindrance than game mechanics.</div></div><hr />

I was parsing a paladin in my group in PoE vs undead.  He was saying how his DPS must be great on Undead since he was getting slays for 2k-4k etc... but the fact was that it hardly improved his DPS at all.  I think his best SU fight he added 17 DPS from Slays... not as massive a 4-7k slay 'looks'.<br />
<br />
Not really a trivial DPS increase though.</div></div><hr />

Hail fellow Warriors.  I've been away from these boards for quite a while.  I pretty much quit playing my 57 War in favor of my necro.  So anything new happening in the Warrior world?

While near-SoD level aggro weapons (SotB, CHoS, GSoT) selling for 5k in the bazaar may not have been what you had in mind, it is a major boost to the mid-50s warrior.  Pretty much anyone can camp or buy decent aggro weapons these days, which is a good boost to warriors, even if it doesn't &quot;balance&quot; things, they are much better in the mid levels than they were a few months ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">09-11-2003, 12:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">notice the THAT part of it, its almost a british way of saying yes there is a problem, but im blatently ignoring it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">09-11-2003, 12:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What do you enjoy more?<br />
<br />
There are players who change classes as class balance changes and there are players who pick a class because thats what they enjoy and stick with their character.<br />
<br />
A small personal side note from me: even when warriors were the premier tank for XP groups (Thinking of when I levelled through the early 50's during late Velious) there were too many warriors, I used to spend more time sitting on my arse LFG in Karnors back then with 10 other warriors than I do now simply because every group in the zone already had 1 warrior and some had 2.  As a warrior main back then in a treeweave and still dreaming of the day I could afford a lammy (they went for 14k dammit!) I was also one of the worst geared competing for group spots against some necro's twink who had farmed themselves an FBSS and some pimp weapons.<br />
<br />
Now all the fair weather warriors have rolled up paladins or enchanters or whatever the next great class is that will guarantee them fame, fortune, lewts and a spot in a group.  There are less warriors and the ones who are still playing seem to be better players for the most part.<br />
<br />
So....<br />
<br />
Did you come here to find out if warriors are pimps once again and will you be guaranteed a spot in a group and phat XP and lewts?  <br />
<br />
If thats the case you're prolly better off rolling up a Pally or an SK, or maybe make a beastlord, they seem to be the class of the season with amazing DPS, slows, buffs and even some tanking ability.<br />
<br />
If you want to play a warrior because its the class you enjoy and you want to be the dude up the front dishing it out and taking a beating back against those big raid mobs, then yeah play your warrior, but you've got to work to get there and no one is going to hand you a Blade of Carnage and a set of ornate as a starter pack.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">09-13-2003, 09:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For those who've been away ... the QUOTE:<br />
<br />
&quot;Classes are not that out of balance.&quot; - AbsorEQ<br />
<br />
This quote rests under peoples' sigs because of its IRONY.<br />
<br />
Classes ARE very much out of balance, and people put Absor's quote in their sig because they're annoyed that he can say this.<br />
<br />
It belittles the people who play the game everyday and notice the lack of balance.<br />
<br />
So they rally around his OFFICIAL word, that classes are not that out of balance, and they scoff him.<br />
<br />
Absor needs to be smacked by the famed Clue-By-Four. But until then, maybe if a few thousand people start putting that in their sig, he'll get the point.</div></div><hr />
