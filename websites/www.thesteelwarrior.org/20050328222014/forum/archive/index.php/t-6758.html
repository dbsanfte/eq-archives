Anyone can explain how to do the golem riddle in Yxtta, in order to open the wall to gain access to the primals? thx in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">04-19-2004, 07:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are 6 rooms, with 2 clicky per room.<br />
To every question, there is an answer from 1 to 12 (numerical value).<br />
<br />
We have it translated &amp; bugged in French version so cant really help out.<br />
Overall its something like :<br />
<br />
Q :Where ever you may turn your compass, i shall be behind you.<br />
R : Your back. Because it is always behind you, what ever direction you face.<br />
R2 : On a clock the back is at 6°  so the answer is 6 (Worked for us).<br />
<br />
Some are totally not understandable and you just have to click/wipe/retry.<br />
Seems you cant get the same answer 2 times (hope that helps).</div></div><hr />

I can't really say much more than has been said other than if you fail enough times, the golems stop coming and you can just click randomly on each question til you open the door.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And it moves in a clockwise fashion.  The NE building is 1/2.  You can click on any pot to start the event and you can have 1 wrong answer.  The 2nd incorrect one will bring the golems.  There's also a wait period in between clicks, roughly 30-45 seconds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seems not possible, you just have &quot;the magic aura have faded&quot; when clicking on all plots, you can't &quot;answer&quot; when the aura have faded anymore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Worked fine for us maybe 3-4 weeks ago, we went in and had no clue how things worked and did wave after wave of golems, had to be 10 or more.<br />
<br />
Then they stopped coming when we got wrong answers, and we just kept going til the door opened.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Derrict</div><div class="date">04-20-2004, 07:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also a good way to see what the correct answers for the riddles you haven't seen yet since you can click your heart out without having any golems charge.  Inc nerf!</div></div><hr />

Doesn't seem to work for us until there is a patch.  All we get is faded auras.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raaj</div><div class="date">05-03-2004, 07:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had heard something about being able to blow the event by triggering it. As if it had a time-out on it or something.<br />
<br />
Alll hearsay through guildchat, but eh.,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">05-03-2004, 07:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well its bugged as hell on euro servers ... <br />
So we got some inside info (as to how its supposed to work).<br />
<br />
1) 3 series of 12 questions<br />
2) Need to answer 6 or 7 in a row to open the wall<br />
3) As you fail to answer pops become harder and harder<br />
4) After ??? wrong answers, you have blown the event<br />
<br />
runing out of power &amp; wall opening with chain click = bugs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Surlok</div><div class="date">05-04-2004, 09:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There has been a couple times where we have gone to do the event and got the faded aura message and then the next it works fine.You can start the event solo as a rogue and maybe any other class I am not sure if the side golems that gurad the hosues see invise.<br />
<br />
But I imagine it is blowable perhaps setting the trap golems then zoning them out I don't know but it has occured on our server when other guilds/groups of people have been in that area.<br />
<br />
<br />
If it doesn't work and your dead set on doing the event you can just root push a mob through the wall and have it summon you in as a mage then coth in.I am sure they will fix that at some point as they probably should but until the event is working properly its a working albiet it time consuming method.</div></div><hr />
