<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ascence</div><div class="date">09-24-2003, 03:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello,<br />
<br />
I am playing a DE Warrior on the newbie server. I am untwinked and have limited PP saving. I almost always duo with another DE Warrior (who is my RL GF; she insists that we play the same class/race). <br />
<br />
We have quite easily completed the newbie armor quest. I hear that the armor will last us until the mid 20s. We are using simplistic weapons like the Zaxthril (SP?) and the Velium, and they have been fine for our purpose.<br />
<br />
I find that with enough bandages, we can DUO pretty well at our lvl (10). With both of us bandaged up to 50%, we take turn getting hits and can take blue/white MOBs down pretty fast. I understand this will change in the future, but we plan to play exclusively in LDON groups after lvl 20. So I am not worried about soloing or duoing viability beyond that point. Plus, both of us enjoy grouping much more so anyway.<br />
<br />
Now I see a lot of mid-low lvl items available for purchases via APs in LDON. They start at 10 APs for weapons and 20 APs for armor. The armor pieces cost 20 APs and its BP has the AC of 25, which is better than our Crafted BP. <br />
<br />
So, now I wonder if rather than questing/farming the old-world items (armors and weapons) - is it a good idea to spend the our entire lifes in LDON and using the resulting APs to upgrade armors/weapons as needed along the way? We will also have PPs saved up to buy other things we cannot buy in LDON as well. <br />
<br />
Or, should we start questing for Crafted, or are there some old-world quests/items that we should not miss. All in all, LDON seems to have quite so many perks, and that it may be more rewarding to play in there, instead of lvl-grind in the old-world. Yet my concern is that at lvl 20-30 the APs reward is minial at 1-2 pt per adventure. So perhaps it will take many lvls before I collect all the armor pieces at 20APs each, and I don't know if I will complete my Crafted in less amount of time.<br />

I have a friend that just started so I dusted off a few of my level 20's I had laying around and tried some of the adventures with him.  For one thing, the low level dungeons in LDoN can easily be done with just four people.  And the loot is way above what you would find pretty much anywhere else you could hunt.  Mobs are plentiful so the exp is good as well.  Also those pieces of armor that you buy off the vendor with points usually have more aug slots than regular armor, so the final stats will be quite a bit better than something like crafted.  I've seen several lesser augs drop in the low level dungeon.  (+2 str for example)<br />
<br />
If you do decide to try out LDoN, look into the aggressor set of armor that costs 48 points each in Ruj.  Its a great set of armor for the cost.  Maybe mix some of that set with some of the 20 point set.  An 32AC 5stam 10HP BP with 2 aug slots would last you quite a long time.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />

There are some very nice drops as well on some of the named mobs that could easily keep you going until you get those points.</div></div><hr />

I get in, play an hour and a half, non-stop xp, split loot at end, I get out.  It can't be beat!  Off the subject but so what.</div></div><hr />

I guess it depends on how much you like LDON.  Personally I find I have alot of fun doing it and probably would have spent the majority in LDON if it had been available 3 years ago (the first year basically was LDON without the points heh)</div></div><hr />

I wish my LDoN experiences to date were limited to 1.5 hrs.... more like 2.5 hrs after getting the group, getting there, dealing with LDs and then blowing the mish.. :)<br />
