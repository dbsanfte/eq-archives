<br />
Seems to me that while there are many worthy upgrades for most slots respective of AC/HP, earings and neck slots seem to suffer the most. Back slots to a great extent as well, lotsa mediocre backs but nothing outstanding. Cloak of thorns from NTOV is still attractive. Every other slot seems to have a extremely broad, reasonably comparable set of items to choose from.<br />
<br />
am i missing something or is it just itemization?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">06-17-2003, 03:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">heiro cloak/cloak of flames for back. cloak of thorns are practically non existant, cloak off tvx rarely drops, and warriors cant use the emp shield = (  <br />
<br />
never fear though, there are plenty of upgrades in elemental planes ! lol, i seen at least 4 so far, laughable u have to get to teir 4 before good cloaks start to drop. still heiro cloak is pretty cheap and 70ish hp or something with other stats, really a fine cloak till you can get an uber one.<br />
<br />
earrings - mosquito earrings(uber rare) or blood earring of engagement. both one group farmable, little work to quest your way into tactics but its not hard. uber earrings start to drop when you do aten, seru, or agnarr. seru earring is guaranteed drop, but never taken the time to kill him. never seen an aten earring drop and i would say agnarr earring is his common drop.<br />
<br />
mosquito and blood earring are really nice considering they are gotten by xp groups. agnarr takes 35-40ish to farm, and some wipes learning the script heh.<br />
<br />
neck - chattering bone necklace is good till you can get an uber one. if you can kill lady nev, can probably kill arch lich in ssra too, drops pretty common. weve had good luck with vadyn in akheva too, low ac, but nice item for one group kill. dont have to wait till teir4 for neck items, think there is one off one of the zekk brothers.<br />
<br />
earring is my biggest complaint, agnarr has a big loot table, its not rare but its not that common either. yet to kill elemental gods, i know they drop some but probably only 2 items like agnarr with a large loot table heh.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ragnarz</div><div class="date">06-17-2003, 11:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok, first i said no quests, second most if the items mentioned are junk. People, people, AC is king now. back, neck ears with AC on em seem sparse. that was the reason I posted. Those are the slots I am seeking to upgrade atm and I cant seem to find anything thats really an upgrade (<br />
<br />
for ears i am using tear of the rainmaker and iron cog, good hp crap AC, i still hold onto my silver disk since i cant seem to find anything dramatically better. on my bac is a 10ac 100hp cloak which is decent cause of +25 to all svs but again im looking to do loyalist shield quest for its 50ac and 75hp, unfortunately the faction is coming so slow, killed lycea too many times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">06-19-2003, 06:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">just checked your magelo, you got several raex pieces, are you telling me you havent seen a decent cloak drop yet? im using cloak of combustion myself and one if not 2 drops off the bird everytime. normally i would defer to a nuker with the focus effect but turns out i was bidding against a ranger.<br />
<br />
neck, probably not killing AL anymore so dunno what to tell ya there, if you were still doing VT, aten neck is a drop everytime.<br />
<br />
earring, i agree, there just isnt enough out there unless you're killing seru, aten earring is pretty rare.<br />
<br />
i really think you got your slots covered ok though, all the high ac stuff is in VT for the utility slots, just the way it is. its not poor itemization, its just a game design decision they werent gonna put in high ac/hp slots for every piece of gear you can get. in general you sacrifice ac for hp with pop gear other than the raex. if you want uber ac earring/mask/belt/bp/neck you need to farm vt, but they arent common drops either other than the neck.</div></div><hr />
