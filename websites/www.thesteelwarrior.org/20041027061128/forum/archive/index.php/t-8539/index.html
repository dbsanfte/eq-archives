<br />
We beat this raid once already, and had no issues.  Last week-end however, we went again, killed the three Trusik named, had a rogue loot all the glyphs, then killed the Aneuk Pixxt with AE silence, combined all glyphs and obtained the key to the door.<br />
<br />
Somehow, the rogue tried opening the door but could not, and kept getting knocked out to the zone in.<br />
<br />
Is this a common bug?  The time we won we had a different rogue loot the key components and had no issues, does the person combining the key need to do something special?  It was really annoying, and GM as always were as helpful as ever (aka not at all)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Did :/  Did absolutely nothing.<br />
<br />
The worst part is we got a message about 'doors sliding open' but the doors were staying closed.<br />
<br />
We tried having a shaman VP me through the door, but after going through, I'd get booted to zone in.<br />
<br />
Hellaciously frustrating, 40 people left because of a stupid bug, and a GM told me to get lube basically.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>MezViia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You have to make sure the rogue is using the &quot;use&quot; key, and play with ranges a little bit.<br />
We had this in Ikkinz 4 with the research crafted key.<br />
Just test all along the door and several different ranges pressing the &quot;use&quot; key and it should work, have yet to be completely locked out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Hinterdir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">hit &quot;u&quot; and don't klick the door</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mearis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">hit &quot;u&quot; and don't klick the door<br />
<br />
We did that too.  Got an emote about 'dust sliding off' but the door remained closed even with rogue using use key.<br />
<br />
Grrr so frustrating.</div></div><hr />
