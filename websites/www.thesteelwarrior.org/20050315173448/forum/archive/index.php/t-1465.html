<br />
I am getting ready to join a new guild, and in the past month or so they have done the Chardok royals, Vindi, and Venril Sathir.<br />
<br />
If they can do these mobs, can they do HoT?  Is that where they should go next?<br />
<br />
After HoT is it NToV?<br />
<br />
What's after NToV?  Emperor?  Where does Vex Thal fit in?  AoW?<br />
<br />
Do you hafta do all these Velius and Luclin raids to be properly geared up for PoP tier 2+?<br />
<br />
I've pretty much just been grouping for exp and farming.  I've gone on a few pickup raids to Hate, Fear, Chardok, Naggy, Vox, etc., but now it's time to start getting a little more serious about it.<br />
<br />
If there's a previous thread where this is discussed, please point me to it ... I searched but couldn't find anything covering this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daemonwynd</div><div class="date">06-24-2003, 02:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmmmmm. <br />
<br />
Here's a very rough order:<br />
<br />
Naggy/Vox<br />
Kael<br />
Old Planes: Fear, old Hate, Sky, raids for epics<br />
Talendor/Severilous/Kelorek Dar<br />
HoT<br />
Dain<br />
King Tormax<br />
Vindi<br />
Zlandi/Klandi<br />
Yelinak<br />
WToV named<br />
Rumblecrush/Doomshade<br />
NToV<br />
Ssra excluding ubers<br />
AoW/Cursed<br />
Emperor Ssra/Vex Thal<br />
PoP<br />
<br />
While it is optional to do VT, and to a lesser extent, Ssra, it is highly recommended, as it makes much of PoP a lot easier. In particular, the RZ script appears to be much more difficult for those guilds who bypass Ssra and/or Vex Thal until they farm the lower mobs/gods for a rather extended period of time.<br />
<br />
That's my list. Anyone else?</div></div><hr />

I edited his list some, and these are the way mobs should be done imo.  I added Xanamech / Prototypes because they are so easy for the loot they give out.  ST is still a big step for some guilds...Avatar will greatly increase DPS.  I added Tunare 'cause she must die.</div></div><hr />

This is a topic that has been debated at length and since the changes to the flag system and elem loot droppers I think this is even more of a no brainer.<br />
<br />
You DO NOT have to do Ssra and VT to do tier 2+. You could actually get pretty far on just tradeable gear you buy in the bazaar. However, you are going to have a hard time with RZ and the elem loot droppers are going to tear you a new one. There is a minimum level of gear that you are going to need to have success in the elems. If your tanks are at 8khp/1400ac buffed, then most elem minis are going to tear thru them like a wet paper bag. It happens that the level of gear you will need as a guild is gear from VT/Ssra/PoP bosses<br />
<br />
The arguement before was that tier 1-3 bosses drop loot that is as good or better than Ssra/VT in many cases. That is absolutely true. You CAN gear up on tier 1-3 bosses. The problem before was that the majority of PoP bosses only drop 1-2 pieces of loot. This was somewhat offset by their relatively fast repop, but you still had to get a lot of spawns to equal the amount of gear that you can get from one VT clearing.<br />
<br />
Since the change in the flag system, the speed at which you will get loot has been greatly impacted. VT is still sealed of from anyone who doesn't want to do the time sink VT key and kill the Emp so competition for VT has changed very little. On the other hand, every Tom, Dick, and Harry has access to just about every PoP boss available. Not only that, but everyone has a nifty new charm that gets uber pretty quick if you just kill a few bosses. The competition for any PoP boss that no longer requires a flag to get at is fierce.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">06-24-2003, 01:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Id say in general that your guild should work on the following goals in the order listed below<br />
<br />
1) Get everyone geared up in HoT or similar armor and get as many epics as you can.<br />
<br />
2) Start working on Sleeper tomb keys so you can get primals.  This means killing bosses like Velktor, the Keeper in WToV, various dragons like zland and kland, Statue of RZ and start working through parts of NToV<br />
<br />
3) Start moving on to bigger mobs like Creator and other easier ssra named, start killing AoW and such while still killing the good loot mobs that you need drops from like maybe King Tormax.  Maybe move on to some PoP named here, but in general PoP named have crappy loot in the lower tiers<br />
<br />
If your guild has just killed vindi that should keep you occupied for a while</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daemonwynd</div><div class="date">06-24-2003, 03:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dain is certainly easier than Vindi.<br />
Tormax is a little easier than vindi.</div></div><hr />

<br />
425 Dain = different form of blast healing, etc. Depends on your people I guess. Pull is definitely more of a pain :p<br />
<br />
Tormax = Mandatory Tank Switch due to hps. <br />
<br />
First vindi I ever did he was dead in 3 mins right as disc wore off.<br />
<br />
Just my 2 cp....</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do you hafta do all these Velius and Luclin raids to be properly geared up for PoP tier 2+?<br />
 <br />
<br />
The way in which you progress is up to you, but there are certain things you will not be able to do without some measure of gear. I would say you can't skip more than a couple of 'slots' on each bound.<br />
<br />
If you can take Vindi, you can play in HoT easily, all you need to do is control the pulls. Once you get the majority of your people in decent HoT gear, work on Ikat and Eashen from NToV, and Telk and Gozz. Once you can do Telk and Gozz easy, work into NToV. NToV will teach you alot about raiding, teamwork, as well as bring a large flow of equipment in. While your doing all this, continue to work Vindi and take out Statue and Tormax if you get the chance. If you have 50ish solid well connected people, try Idol unslowed. If you can take Idol unslowed, then you can likely take AoW. As your level of gear goes up, the numbers needed for these encounters goes down. I think last we took AoW in our alliance we took him with 33ish (a fully elementally equiped raid could likely do it with 20-25), but we're a few tiers up from where you sit right now.<br />
<br />
After NToV, you can do several things - based on your numbers and skill level. SSra/Emp is doable next. As is Seru if your willing to put forth the effort. ST used to be 'the next step' but alot skip it now.<br />
<br />
For PoP Tier 2+, yes all those Luclin and Velious encounters are needed. If you can't field 60+ people, don't even think about Bertoxx/TZ/Trial type encounters until your done with VT, IMO. Either that, or plan on spending alot of time gearing up in PoP, even if you do have massive numbers. There ARE many many many encounters in PoP though, and a bunch of them you can do at the HoT stage. Xanamech, Mujaki (although rough), Prototypes, and so on.<br />
<br />
I'll relate my experience quick. I come from a long standing gaming guild, not a power/uber guild. We have some 'power gamers' so we raid alot, but we've never forced/expected raid participation, used DKP, counted what raids so and so was on, etc. We're more of a casual gaming guild, we find that works for us well and those that want a raiding guild move on. We can field between 20 and 30ish level 65 people depending on the night and time, with another 10 in the 59-64 range. We have people in the guild that have been raiding a long time, and understand alot about the different aspects of leading/being on a raid. I lead most of our in house things, and I started leading pre-kunark in PoF/PoHate. Man....anyone remember those 13 hour runs clearing Hate? Hah! Anyways....<br />
<br />
In no way did I ever expect to see the Elemental Planes, not with the way our guild was structured. We were about 1.5-2 years behind on content I think, having just 'finished' with NToV when PoP came out. We ended up hooking up with another guild on our server that we had many long standing friends in, slightly stronger than we were. They were in the process of working luclin mobs along with some velious (ST, Tormax/AoW), Burrower, IV, etc).<br />
<br />
We never hit SSra in force, although each of the guilds have a few kills in there (most of them recent in the last month and a half or so). Neither guild has been in VT. We have one Seru kill. They have a few ST runs, but not a ton, and I considered it a waste of time given the age of the game to told my people to skip it. Between us we have 5 or so AoW kills.<br />
<br />
We have massive numbers when we come together, between the two guilds and our close friends outside them, we often have TOO many people. Goes with the territory, personally I'd like to do with less but I'm not about to tell a friend that's been working his arse off with us for 6 months not to come on a particular raid because we're full and/or don't need him. We're both non-raiding guilds, we play for enjoyment, so I don't think that would work for us. We try to limit the levels we allow on some of the more difficult encounters, but mostly it's if they are online, they are there...heh. <br />
<br />
Anyways, the point is, we never hit Emp or VT. We have hit PoP lower bosses ALOT. Protos, Xana, TT, Trials, Mujaki, etc etc. If you hit those enough you can use that as your progression instead of VT, although I do believe it will take longer.<br />
<br />
One thing I've noticed, is there are some major Farming Points in the game where your whole guild/alliance goes through upgrading.<br />
<br />
HoT/WWing, NToV/ST, SSra/VT, TSR/PoF.<br />
<br />
If you skip one of those steps, it's doable, but you have to fill it with content somewhere to make up. You can get Behemoth down and get access to PoTactics decently easy once you have the right people, strat and practice. But waltzing into PoTactics, even if you know exactly what do to down to the nth degree, and trying TZ in HoT gear is going to wake you up after the 30 seconds it takes TZ to kill your raid party. <br />
<br />
Oh, to finish the story. We're Elemental now, just downed RZtW for the 3rd time this week. Was kinda clean too, I lived (with agro) as MT through the whole fight! Was kinda flabergasted =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fvighlander</div><div class="date">06-27-2003, 04:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Zantaer is exactly right. There are certain zones and points in the common raid progression that can only be described as utter loot pinatas. NToV and VT come to mind.... one raid of decent length will get you over 10 named kills with 2-3 pieces of nice loot from each, taking your entire guild to a new level of gear within a few raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baadan</div><div class="date">06-27-2003, 04:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem I have with the lists above is that they switch back and forth from CoV/Thurg/Kael faction. Killing one Zlandicar or Vindi or Dain won't make you KOS or drop you more than maybe two levels (right? I'm kind of guessing here) but that's still a pain to faction back to normal. Of course, killing Zlandicar, Vindi, and Dain your factions probably wouldn't change much =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raunstonecutter</div><div class="date">06-28-2003, 01:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Factionless = teh win =)<br />
<br />
Guild advancement requires some faction destruction.  Currently, I'm KOS to giants and dragon, and I think I might be to dorfs (2 dain kills from max ally).  To get through NToV and ST, you really need to can faction.  Make sure the majory of your raiders are happy with their gear from their current faction.  I'd say once you get that point, then giant would be the way to go.  Dain and Yelinak head are awsome quest returns.</div></div><hr />
