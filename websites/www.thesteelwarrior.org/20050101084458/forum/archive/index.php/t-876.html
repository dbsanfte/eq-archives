&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br />
&gt;An old farmer has about 200 hens, but no rooster, and he wantschicks.<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br />
So he goes down the road to the next farmer and asks if he has arooster that he would sell.<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br />
&quot;Yeah, I've got this neat rooster named Kenny. He'll service every chicken you got, no problem.&quot;<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br />
Well, Kenny the rooster costs a lot of money, but the farmer decides he'd be worth it.<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br />
He takes Kenny home and sets him down in the barnyard, first, giving the rooster a pep talk: &quot;I want you to pace yourself now, Kenny, you've got a lot of chickens to service here, and you cost me a lot of money....<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I'll need you to do a good job. So, take your time and have some fun.&quot;<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br />
Kenny seemed to understand so the farmer pointed toward the henhouse and Kenny took off like a shot.<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br />
WHAM!- Kenny nails every hen in the henhouse three or four times!<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br />
The farmer is shocked.<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br />
After that there's a commotion in the duck pen. Sure enough, Kenny is in there.<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br />
Later, the farmer sees Kenny after a flock of geese, down by the lake.<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br />
Once again - WHAM! He gets all the geese.<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br />
By sunset Kenny is out in the fields chasing quail and pheasants. The farmer is distraught and worried that his expensive rooster won't even last 24 hours.<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br />
Sure enough, the farmer awakens the next morning only to find Kenny on his back, feet in the air, stone still in the middle of the yard, vultures are circling overhead.<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br />
The farmer, saddened by the loss of such a colorful and expensive animal, shakes his head and says, &quot;Oh, Kenny, I told you to pace yourself. I tried to get you to slow down, now look what you've done to yourself!&quot;<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br />
Kenny opens one eye, nods toward the buzzards circling in the sky and says:<br />
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br />
&quot;Shhh, they're getting closer.&quot;</div></div><hr />
