<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krun</div><div class="date">01-31-2005, 09:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Trying to make sense to all these random macro threads and it's hurting my head.  Mainly because i think 90% of them require some form of add on (or UI) and the people who wrote it just happens to forget mentioning them.<br />
<br />
Is it just me or does the basic interface does not even work macros properly?<br />
<br />
This simple macro (to test if it worked or not)<br />
<br />
/cast Bloodrage<br />
<br />
did not work for me on the basic interface (and no Bloodrage does not have a rank)<br />
<br />
<br />
I downloaded Cosmos, did the SAME command and it worked.  Using this UI was able to make simple macros like:<br />
<br />
/cast Challenging Shout<br />
/p AE Taunt actice  6 sec<br />
<br />
<br />
or <br />
<br />
/cast Shield Wall<br />
/p Defensive active 15 secs<br />
<br />
<br />
etc...  macros worked like a charm BUT the refresh time does NOT show on the macro hence i had to put the actual CS and SW on the 2nd bar to show when it would become active (any commands to make the macros shade out during cooltime?)<br />
<br />
Is there a cosmos ui add on that makes macros possible? I realize cosmos is a better UI but atm with their alpha version it's full of bugs and keeps crashing, want to find if there's a macro add on or something to make basic interface work.<br />
<br />
<br />
ALSO<br />
<br />
<br />
it seems the /cast command does NOT work for 'talent based ability' such as Last stand, i've tried all the variations possible and it just doesn't work.  Which leads me to believe it's a different command instead of /cast.  A simple macro such as :<br />
<br />
/cast Last Stand (i know this is the wrong command)<br />
/p Last Stand Activated 20secs<br />
<br />
That way your healer will know to chain heal you etc.. instead of typing in group chat  while your trying to maintain aggro from 6+mobs.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thx for any input</div></div><hr />

I looked at it a bit. Wikiwow should some basic stuff. I think you need CastSpellByName(TalentName(Rank #)) I am not sure about the syntax on abilities without ranks (I think you just skip it).</div></div><hr />
