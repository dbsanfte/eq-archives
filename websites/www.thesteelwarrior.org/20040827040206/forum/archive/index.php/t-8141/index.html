<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">What I like doing is going to Babel Fish (http://babelfish.altavista.com) and translating stuff from english to another language using the same character set. For example, take &quot;swift&quot; and translate it to spanish, french, german, dutch, italian and portugeuse. You'll get: Rapido, Rapide, Schnell, Vlug, Rapido and Rapido. If you see a name you like the look of, modify it slightly and make it your own if you need to. Theme suggestions: Felines. Types of trees. S words (not swords). Colors. Flavors. I'm sure you get the basic idea. It'll be unique, and it's a way to choose a name with the idea you want that isn't likely taken.</div></div><hr />

That is so not true.  Outhouse is just a place where I get to say &quot;Fuck&quot; a lot, Rickshaw is the true plane of idiocy.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Frosst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">My first character was a human warrior, but I switched to wood elf when I saw a lvl 33 wood elf warrior in full crafted with bladed thulian claws and a painbringer. I thought he looked like a samurai and a few minutes later, I started over and made the character that I still play today. I knew that wood elves did not have the best stats to start with and the choice was made purely for aesthetic reasons. As for my name, it just came to me spontaneously one day when I was playing my first character and I decided that if I ever made another character, that &quot;Frosst&quot; would be its name. Just give it some thought and try to come up with a name that fits your character and personality. I decided that if I ever play another mmorpg, it will be a bard type character named &quot;Chickens&quot;...not really but the thought of it makes me laugh for some reason.</div></div><hr />

I can't count the number of times I have been asked for SoW, it didnt help that I was 60 before I stopped wearing a chain graphic BP, but even in full plate wielding my epics I'd have group members ask for SoW and stand looking at me when there wasn't a SoWer in the group (and sometimes they weren't even taking the piss)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yea, I kinda have some blame to this. I always tell the group I'm a rogue or a berserker. <br />
<br />
(I'm a half-elf ranger. In chain. Have my bow out half the time. Never /role or /anon except when raiding. Half the time, I'm pulling. With harmony.)</div></div><hr />
