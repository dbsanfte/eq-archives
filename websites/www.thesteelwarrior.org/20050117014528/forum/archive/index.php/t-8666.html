<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hittem</div><div class="date">08-27-2004, 11:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have taken to using Vxed for my exp zone.<br />
I four box a bard/shaman/druid/warrior group on four PC.<br />
I found i died a LOT and blew a TON of mana if i just pulled, tanked, slowed and healed.  <br />
<br />
What I do is i send bard out and he pulls with HoS (resist debuff).  Then when he is close to my zone line camp, he starts singing mez.  It sticks most often, but if it doesn't he just kites the mob around for a tick until it sticks.<br />
<br />
Shaman Malos ASAP.  Druid snares.  Shaman cripples and slows.<br />
Warrior taunts until successful taunt happens.<br />
Bard starts twisting mana and overhaste.<br />
Warrior attacks, bard and shaman pet melee also.<br />
<br />
If its just a pooka or a stonemite, only the shaman needs to heal.  Shaman has full healing AA and does about 2300 per 10 seconds.  It seems to be enough with the odd quiesence thrown in.<br />
The dogs and the lizards do a lot more dps and i need to have the druid heal also - he has a 5600hp heal per 10 sec.<br />
See my magelo for my gear.  I usually have a CoF in back slot as i have no other haste item and trib gets too expensive to use except on raids, so usually i'm doing this with ~8800hp and 1630ac roughly as its just shaman and druid buffs.  The warrior also does have full AA so perhaps that needs to be factored into the equation.<br />
<br />
I figure if I can tank this stuff with 1630ac and only a shaman healing, I figure more folks can do it with a druid &amp; cleric than they think.  I see a lot of folks complaining that its too hard, but if you debuff the nasty critter before you engage, it works pretty well.<br />
<br />
I use a bard to hold the mob for debuffing, but i think it would work equally well if you had someone rooting the mob for the debuff phase, so really you could use pretty much any puller.  I see rangers pulling a lot in our guild Vxed charm groups.<br />
<br />
I get Umbiki to spawn within an hour or two of creating the zone and starting to kill, but i have yet been unable to best him.  Umbiki is unmezzable and he pops back to spawn if the bard fades on pull (grrrr SoE nerfs).  To date i haven't been able to figure out how to coordinate my hands to keep my warrior alive while engaging Umbiki.  He puts out a lot of DPS.  I tried furious but its been nerfed and the name mob ignores the furious warrior and goes straight off to chew on the next toon on his hate list.<br />
<br />
I encourage folks to get into Vxed and try it if they have been holding off.  It can be tanked by a non ele-equipped tank.  I think you need some AC and some AA, but it can be done.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Errrrrm, I don't think so.....last I checked, DEFENSIVE was nerfed only on Jhiru in tipt and Diabolic Destroyer in ikkinz 1.  Umbiki puts out some rough numbers.  Maybe kite him around and try to slow, throw on deftdance, get warrior into position, AT then furious?  Or you could get a competent enchanter and own him with a pet's dps $$</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Celeritum</div><div class="date">08-27-2004, 11:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Umbiki doesn't ignore furious, nor does he ignore stonewall. Just furious first, then incite (or bellow if you have it) and when it wears off, defensive or stonewall. For that matter, Charoov doesn't ignore these discs either, and he's very close to Umbiki's prime spawn location, but he dishes out more damage and enrages. Umbiki does not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Celeritum</div><div class="date">08-27-2004, 11:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also having said that, I'd recommend you find a skilled Enchanter to do this with you. Experience with a charmed pet will still be 3%/kill aa, with the occasional 2%er, but you'll kill so damned fast it won't even be funny.<br />
<br />
Also, remember if you're having problems pulling Charoov because you are intimidated by his spawn location, just run up and tag him. Don't bother with pacification or Fading Memories or anything - you won't have any problems, trust me. As long as you stay out of proximity aggro range of the other mobs in his area.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hittem</div><div class="date">08-27-2004, 12:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree its dead easy to do this with a chanter.<br />
I'll try Umbiki again with furious upon engaging.  Last time i tried it i had a necro in group and he instantly caught agro.  I assumed he caught agro because of furious nerf.  Must be due to him catching agro via normal necro noobage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Umbiki definitely doesnt ignore furious / stonewall / defensive, my group so happened to run into him two nights ago.  Nothing in vxed does in my experiences.<br />
<br />
Your necro was probably still stuck in 'solo mode' :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ibithor</div><div class="date">08-28-2004, 02:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">there was never a nerf to furious and it worked fine on  umbiki and trickster this past week as did defensive</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">WaardarMT</div><div class="date">08-28-2004, 05:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I applaud your efforts, but the xp / drops you'd get in KT would demolish what you're getting in Vxed. Just run the trial and go to KT mang.</div></div><hr />

I haven't had good luck with Sewer runs and gave up on em.  Bleah.<br />
Tried Smith Rondo once but failed.  Will try again shortly.  Vxed Tipt are easy to win with a chanter and we'll be doing em any time now.  So KT won't be far off for me.  But i made this post not to whine about my own position in the game, but to indicate to others that Vxed is a viable place to do exp and get loot.<br />
<br />
Today, after killing about my 400th zone trash mob, i got the face item to fall finally.  The 13AC 115HP replaces my 12AC 60HP FH face.  Also managed to tank Umbiki and get a nice new chest item for a robe friend.<br />
<br />
Thanks everyone for your input.  Furious and Stonewall do work fine in Vxed  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bashiae</div><div class="date">08-31-2004, 05:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Somewhat off topic, but as mentioned you mentioned, it's easy to get frusrated with the sewers, especially if you get stuck on the first one and don't have a consistent group of friends to get together with.<br />
<br />
I have virtually the same gear as yourself (yours is actually slightly better) and while I am a capable tank for the first sewers trial, it's really a matter of finding a good group to help.<br />
<br />
That said, I've found the easiest way to progress through the Sewers is to find a rogue friend and a good, smart cleric.  If you have access to someone's cleric, all the better, but make sure they're level 65.<br />
<br />
Then, have everyone but the cleric make corpses inside the Sewers Plant zone, and as the rogue is dragging corpses to the stonemight room, have the cleric use his gnomish vanishing device, improved invis undead, and pacification to get down to Ansharu, hail for stonemite pop, then to the stonemite room.  I play a secondary cleric and this has worked flawlessly for me a couple times, just have to be patient and make extensive use of F9/camera angles and invis items.  The hardest part is the room where you must enter the water, since there's so many mobs.  It's possible you may get a bad pop of mobs (lots of undead and regular mobs mixed up) that you can't pacify/invis past properly in this room.  If so, you can quit the expedition and get a new one for a new set of mob pops.<br />
<br />
Once you get past the water room, however, nothing will see through regular invis, including the 9 popped stonemites, so just have the cleric pick one side of the room to begin CR.  You'll be underwater, but otherwise completely safe to res and buff everyone up.  That's it, kill 10 mobs and trial complete, then the rest of the trials are 5 times easier (in my opinion).<br />
<br />
Good luck!<br />
<br />
P.S. If you can't find a Cleric able/willing to do it, it's very likely you could 'help' the Cleric down to the room with your bard in basically the same manner - just adds more difficulty the more people you add of course.</div></div><hr />
