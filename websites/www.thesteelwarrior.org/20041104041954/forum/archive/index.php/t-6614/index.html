<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kujawa Zek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Basically re-equiping after a couple months off. War is RZ Ogre, has thurg bp, ornate helm (which might be replaced by a WDH if i don't sell it), and a solstice earring. So basically looking for advice to re-equip with. Will be un-guilded with some friends, can do BoT Mini's. Have exactly 1,167,063pp to spend, maybe only 1067k depending on if my RL friend comes back and wants to play again hehe. Any advice will be apperciated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Go to www.magelo.com and create a character profile.  Its easier for us to see what gear you have so we can suggest upgrades.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>turkishbull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hey Kujawa....are you ever gonna stick with one class and play it.  I think you have tried to gear up every class available for over a year now........LOL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">*full set of fierce heraldic (for slots you dont have anything)<br />
*elemental bow<br />
*Blade of Carnage for primary (expensive but worth it)<br />
*Cloak of Flames<br />
*valorium rings of gallantry<br />
*black plated collar (good)<br />
*amygdalan chain mask<br />
*Copper hammer of striking for offhand until you get a great blade of storms out of towers<br />
*at least one bloodmetal earing of engagement<br />
<br />
<br />
depending on how much cash you got left over, you may want to sub in some ornate armor in place of that fierce heraldic.<br />
if you got lots of cash to burn .. may want to consider:<br />
<br />
*helmet of rallos zek<br />
*2 crystallized acid bracers<br />
*2 steel rings of earthen resilience<br />
*bloodied boots of dark rites<br />
*warlords steel gauntlets<br />
<br />
out of BoT towers see if you can round up with your friends:<br />
<br />
*Great Blade of Storms (amazing aggro)<br />
*Ornate BP mold<br />
*GSo4W (amazing dps)<br />
<br />
with over a million plat, you have the possibility to pass lots of semi-raiding warriors who have been working on their gear for a long time if youre frugal and wait for good deals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kujawa Zek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">K, pretty much the same ideas i had. Turk... lol, I have yet to gear up a mage, ranger, shaman and berserker. Those casters are so lame  :mad: . Cept for cleric (cause getting 4 tells for groups after logging in is cool hehe), and wizard (who can resist the huge crits). Its better to strip and re-equip then quit altogether though =/. Thanks for the imput guys.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">get the ornate gaunts.. under 30k on veeshan and they have clicky haste. and for those who say &quot;you will never need it&quot; ... thats true ... until you do. and then its a godsend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Pumilio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">get helm of RZ! acid bracers x 2 BoC and ornate bp = p<br />
also look for a iron cog earring.<br />
let me see, personally for haste I like the scale cracker for range slot and haste but I don't pull much if ever.<br />
<br />
bloodmetal earring for other ear, steel earthen ring of resiliance x2, fierc heraldic legs and other slots as is necessary and you should be gold until raid drops</div></div><hr />
