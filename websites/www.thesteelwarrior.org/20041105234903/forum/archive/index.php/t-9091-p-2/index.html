<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">it's that for the people it was designed for (italics added for emphasis) <br />
<br />
Thats the most stupid argument ever. Hey i got an idea !<br />
Lets change the clicky to &quot;Summon : Flask of Water&quot;<br />
<br />
Ubers STFU ! its not the 2.0 Anyway <br />
Non ubers STFU ! its the 1.5, you have no reason to complain !<br />
Its a lot better than anything available so far.<br />
You dont like it ? Then dont do the quest. <br />
<br />
99.99% Of warriors wont even notice the 2 second difference on the Incite timer.<br />
As for the clicky .... I have commented it enough.<br />
<br />
Does this seem &quot;up to par&quot; with GroupDarb + 1500hp heal of the cleric epic ?<br />
<br />
Like or Not there are 2 facts :<br />
- Our epic has a useless focus (28 or 30 sec incite wont change anything)<br />
- Our epic has an underpowered clicky (Overall &amp; Comparing it to other 1.5)<br />
<br />
If you are turning this into a 1.5 vs 2.0 or Casual vs Uber.<br />
Then you have sadly achieved a higher state of retardness.<br />
<br />
Damn,  Even Raaj that felt that my ranting/whining was way too overboard, partially agrees :<br />
The stats make you go : OOOOOOOOHHHHH<br />
The effects make you go : DOH !<br />
<br />
And &quot;DOH&quot; just isnt right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Pumilio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">you're bitching about it's stats compared to a 2HS?<br />
<br />
That's right bitching that a 1hs has less stats and ratio then a 2HS?<br />
<br />
I'm glad this got moved where it was, this thread is utter whining bullshit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Besrikarle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">II think if they made the incite focus increase the amount of hate added, instead of reducing the timer, and made the mitigation buff a proc instead of a clicky, this would be perfect!</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Yeah, perfect...you do realize making the effect a proc (with WA5) essentially gives warriors a 15% higher resist rate than any other tank and 10% higher mitigation for the group with a warrior tank without any restrictions other than losing a buff slot, right?  Yeah, that's balanced...<br />
<br />
Tell that to the Paladins whose epic effect gives them a stun proc for 1 minute, or the Shadowknights whose epic allows the group to be healed for a portion of their melee damage.  Compared to the other two tank classes, the warrior epic almost fits right in.<br />
<br />
Actually, I'd be in favor in increasing the hate on Incite instead of lowering reuse, if my vote mattered.<br />
<br />
I've already stated I'm in favor of upping the amount of the rune.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">With all due respect...<br />
<br />
Generalizations are cool.  Seems to be getting more and more applicable to the whiners (not the complainers, the whiners) here every day.<br />
<br />
This is a pre-time, mid-time weapon, which is where it's intended to be. Funny that the loudest complainers are the ones beyond this level...<br />
<br />
However, if you've got sights on this click saving your ass tanking some boss mob post time you're delusional, and it's redicuous to expect that sort of thing. I actually agree with this statement.  It's not meant to save your ass on named.  It's meant to be a useful effect on random stuff.  You think the other two tank classes, the epic effects you should be comparing it to, have incredibly ass-saving effects?<br />
<br />
A second (and valid) complaint is that of the focus. If you chain incite to pull you're going to notice your endurance going down. A reduction of endurance cost, would have done loads more than a reduction in the incite timer.<br />
<br />
There's many ways they could do the focus.  This focus makes Incite available faster.  If you're trying to hold agro using Incite line on one mob while tanking another, you'd pretty much want Incite available faster, wouldn't you?  It isn't so much chaining it on one mob, it's being able to use it again faster so you can hit another mob with it while tanking multiple.  I think you can spare the Endurance for a couple mobs in camp at once without CC, can't you?  Just go easy afterwards for a few mobs while it regens.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The cleric epic is really only clicky that people are super excited about heh.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, that's balanced....<br />
<br />
ever think of negatif proc mod ? if they really want, they can tun it to a proc with a monstuous negative proc rate mod so that it fires at around 0.1ppm (with or without WA5, it's up to them). But I personally vote for a 1s cast time (just add 1s more for the recast to make it &quot;equal&quot; to other epic).<br />
<br />
Actually, I'd be in favor in increasing the hate on Incite instead of lowering reuse, if my vote mattered.<br />
<br />
agree here. or maybe instead of 15% timer reduction, having 5% of timer reduction and 5% of hate increase and 5% of end cost, so that everybody gets a bit of satisfaction.<br />
<br />
I've already stated I'm in favor of upping the amount of the rune.<br />
<br />
I would rather vote for increasing its duration to 10min (its recast time) so that it can be cast before the fight (at least for the rune part, one minute for the spell resist is good enougth). Moreover I don't really think it's unballancing to give the rune a longer chance to be fully used.<br />
<br />

I'm sorry, the cleric epic doesnt' hold a candle to the Paladin epic.  They basically got their &quot;pseudo defensive&quot; and no one even realizes it.   The Paladin effect is *game changing* for them, if it were in game when GoD went live, there would've been no discussion of balance whatsoever, they'd have been able to beat every single group mob in there.<br />
<br />
Adding 20% effectiveness to heals that others land on you for one minute is *way, way, way* more important than a group vie that you can't get off when you need.  The difference is night and day.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The loudest complainers are also apparently the most jaded. That's what makes this whole thread laughable, that it's a bunch of qvic+ players bitching that a time-level weapon doesnt blow their socks off. It was never supposed to. The effect/focus could use some tuning perhaps, but even if they aren't changed it's a solid item for the effort required.<br />
<br />

<br />
I don't think we have to compare it to other melee. Comparing apples to oranges is what gets us into class balance discussions over and over again. Rather, what's an appropriate effect for a warrior at that level of play?:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
There's many ways they could do the focus.  This focus makes Incite available faster.  If you're trying to hold agro using Incite line on one mob while tanking another, you'd pretty much want Incite available faster, wouldn't you?  It isn't so much chaining it on one mob, it's being able to use it again faster so you can hit another mob with it while tanking multiple.  I think you can spare the Endurance for a couple mobs in camp at once without CC, can't you?  Just go easy afterwards for a few mobs while it regens.<br />
<br />
Very true, while I wasn't assuming chaining it on one mob but rather the rate at which you would want to pull mobs. I'm sure I'm not the only warrior that uses it to pull more often than to secure agro on something. If you're tanking multiple mobs that would imply they aren't mezable, so swapping back and forth doing damage to both would be just as effective as relying on incite to hold it on you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok.  I'm one.<br />
<br />
I routinely tank mobs in groups and in raids with either a BBB or a Sword of Ssra.  If your group and or raid is SMART and not mindless fruit gnats, nobody ever should pull aggro off a warrior who has Incite.<br />
<br />
My primary weapon is a Vanazir, which I tanked with for at least 3 months before I put an anger 3 aug on it.  That proc is NOT a hate proc, but ANY proc generates a level of hate.<br />
<br />
Secondly, the weapon is 1 handed.  Yes, it doesn't generate hate like an Anger or Enraging blow.  But neither does a shield which a LOT of warriors use to tank with.<br />
<br />
I've been playing this game for a lot longer than most of you heh, and it just makes me sick how the complaining has only gotten worse.<br />
<br />
If you don't like the way Sony itemizes THEIR game, then quit.  Stop bellyaching.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Well the next step will doubtless be to take into account the Paladin complaint that they'll be right clicking their epic to tank but switching in one of their awesome one-handers and a (for them) now much more useful shield when tanking.<br />
<br />
No doubt to make the best melee right click even better for them, SoE will make it right clickable from inventory.<br />
<br />
Of course, to be *cough* even-handed Warriors will be able to do this with our Epic right-click too. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Yes and No Frodlin, <br />
<br />
I didnt realize it at first, but after talking to some people about it I did realize how its more powerful then I thought.<br />
<br />
In short the reason why its a good ffect (the pal eic one) is because it allows you stay ahead of the &quot;heal curve&quot; easier.<br />
<br />
That is if mob is doing 800 DPS, and you chaining Light is doing 750 DPS, the paladin will obviously eventually die.<br />
<br />
This is a signicent part of why its hard for Paladins to tank 1 group mobs.<br />
<br />
But its not the only, while it does in a way Sort of effect the spike, it doesnt exactly effect the spike - which is where a lot of the trouble is/was.<br />
<br />
Defensive reduces both the Spike, and the HP/S needed, - the clicky on pal epic reduces the HP/S needed (or rather increase's what you have - same concept though)<br />
<br />
But your right in the fact that most people undervalue pal epic clicky, espcially at first glance, i know i'm guility of it.<br />
<br />
Dont pass it out as a miracle cure tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">My primary weapon is a Vanazir, which I tanked with for at least 3 months before I put an anger 3 aug on it. That proc is NOT a hate proc, but ANY proc generates a level of hate.<br />
The aggro from the AC debuff on the Vanazir proc should actually be quite substantial. Debuffs are very effective aggro procs. That is why back in the day a Frostbringer was such a good weapon, and why many warriors are clamoring to pick up a Sword of Midwinter's Vengeance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Grimmels right, a VDD is comparable if not superior to a BoW due to combiniation of sheer ratio, and a medicore hate proc, saying that you can hold aggro with it, isnt that surprising</div></div><hr />

<br />
It seems like our epic is the only melee epic that is clearly inferior to our time weapon. This isn't a gripe at our epic, but at the balance between ours and the other epics. We seem to have gotten the short end of the stick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Charsi MacBlizzard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Ok a few points here.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry, the cleric epic doesnt' hold a candle to the Paladin epic. They basically got their &quot;pseudo defensive&quot; and no one even realizes it.

<br />
Yep.  People here that are saying we shouldnt compare our epic to others...  I just dont get you, I honestly dont.  Why should our epic be a PoS, only useful to those not near the high end game, while another class gets something that is super useful at any level?  If that doesnt bother you then SoE loves you to death because you'll love it when they finally remove your class from the game by giving knights what they want:  Warrior tanking + their spell books.  Its slowly happening.   How people can be slowly poisoned and aplaud the effort just baffles me.   <br />
<br />
Even if you take the position that its ok if others eat steak while we get rat meat, as long as its &quot;appropriate for a warrior at this point in the game&quot;, is a 'warrior epic&quot; weapon that is sub par agro compared to what the state of the art was 2 expansions ago &quot;appropriate&quot;?  I think not. <br />
<br />
Also, what knights are you guys associating with?  I saw a thread on this site that said knights should be given incite.  I told an SK friend of mine this and he laughed his ass off.  We both agreed totally on the following: First, no knight would want that PoS when there are much more effective tools available to them.  Second, any knight that cant get and lock agro in a group should delete.  Its not hard.  Seriously, if you are an Sk or Pally and cant get and lock agro in a group, delete now and quit wasting your time, because you'll obviously never get the hang of this game.  <br />
<br />
What knights do you know that have decent gear and have trouble tanking group mobs?  Here's a news flash: If a knight is having trouble, a warrior in similar gear will as well.  A well equiped knight can not only tank any group mob in this game quite well, but quite a bit of raid content.  If you are a knight having trouble tanking group mobs, your gear is the problem, not class balance.  <br />
<br />
Dont get me wrong here, I love knights.  I use them all the time in my guild's tank strats, precisely because they can tank very well.  Our SKs are my ace cards.  And I love to have them in groups with me, they add a lot of utility.  But I dont love them so much that I'm not completely sick of them getting constantly upgraded every time they whine and us constantly getting the shit end of the stick.  Apparently giving knights warrior tanking ability + spells+special abilities is not unbalancing, but giving warriors an agro weapon upgrade once every expansion or two is??  What really boggles my mind is people are buying into that line of reasoning. <br />
<br />
Then there is this exchange: <br />
<br />

<br />

<br />
Not sure what level of the game your guild is at but that doesnt really apply to most of us here.  If your group or raid wants to wear kid gloves and not do any dps, debuff when the mob hits 25% life, etc, you could tank time with an SSoY.  But thats not really an effective solution.  Having a raid walk on eggshells because your agro is pathetic isn't a solution to the agro issue. <br />
<br />
<br />
I agree with reply 1: If the game were the same as it was before agro procs, that would be a valid comment.  As it stands, its a silly nonsensical statement. <br />
<br />
As an aside, has anyone that is claiming a Vanazir is anywhere near on par with a BoW actually seen both in use?  I saw it in Time for months and a BoW owns a Vanazir hands down.  I'll tell you that having used a BoW,  my ST will tell you that having used a Vanazir.  Its not even close.   And a BoW isnt even close to DB+EoE and two A3 augs. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I really wouldnt have a problem with epic 1.5 or 2.0 being so bad, or being a good upgrade only to someone that cant get to Time (which I might note here is already 2 expansions old..) IF those of us at the high end of the game had received some sort of weapon upgrade since Time.  We have not.  The Tacvi weapon is at best on par with DB agro, and that has yet to be shown definitively.  Stats are nice, but if its  a downgrade in agro, its a downgrade for a warrior.  The fact that we have not received any agro weapon upgrade since Time, AND our epic is rather craptastic, is annoying.  No agro proc on something called a warrior epic? I mean really, wtf.  Thats insulting. <br />
<br />
I'm glad that people at the lower end of the game are getting something they can achieve that is a decent upgrade for them.  God knows being a warrior in EQ without top notch equipment is a hard, hard life.  I had the crappiest gear in the game for 59 levels (back in the day when there was only 50, then 60) so I know how hard it is.  But those of us on the high end have got no agro weapon upgrade for quite some time.  Seeing a warrior epic that is sub time is not encouraging at all.  <br />
<br />
A 2 second decrease in incite timer on 1.5 and a 4 second decrease on 2.0..... Does anyone really care?  Is that going to make a difference?  When it was reported to be 18 secs vs 30... yeah great.   But a couple seconds, c'mon now.  The rune is nice, but a timer on cast +no chanelling means it will mostly be useful on groups and not on long named fights.  2 Aug slots is nice, but 2xA3 is still not as nice as EB +A3, and especially not as nice as EB (proc rate modded) +A3. <br />
<br />
When will we finally see an upgrade?  Unfortunately, probably when enough of us quit, as happened with GoD, that SoE feels the hit on their pocket books and tosses us a bone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I said:<br />

Apparently a dev has said:<br />
After this next live patch, all epics will be usable for inventory. So if you're more of the one-hander type knight, then you can still have some effectiveness out of your epic (by being able to click it from inventory) and still use a 1hander and shield.<br />
Of course SoE is even-handed. All three plate tanks will get this, just like we all got shield block and shield AC not being reduced by reaching the &quot;cap&quot;. It's not their fault that Paladins benefit more than Warriors from these changes.<br />
<br />
Oh ya, lets not be comparing the Warrior Epic right-click to that of other classes. Let's not look at Aura of Ruin or Savage Yawnslaught.<br />
<br />
The game added 5 more levels, and pretty much all I got was Bazu Bellow. At least my twink Paladin is enjoying OoW (have you seen the Blade of Disruption, Benevolent Girdle, the Dragorn Commoners Ring? Gimmel, you chose the wrong class to twink).<br />

OoW is a VERY nice expansion for casuals, light raiders, casters, and hybrids.<br />

My previous guild was one of the first 5 or so to kill Quarm, and I tanked Quarm with a BBB, and the fight took just as long as other guilds who's warriors tank with a BoW or 2x Enraging/Anger.  <br />
<br />
Walking on eggshells? No.  Using their fucking heads and not overaggroing just because they want the Dam Deathwalker uber dps award? Yes.  <br />
<br />
I've always said that aggro management is the RAIDS job, NOT just the warriors.  If your raid pulls aggro off a warrior during a boss fight, you deserve to wipe.  We rarely if at all wipe due people drawing aggro off the warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Barraind</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">If any warrior thinks the paladin epic effect is anywhere near warrior tanking + spellbooks, you are seriously out of your mind.  Ditto if you look at the warrior epic 1.5 and think &quot;wow this is a pile of crap&quot;.   Other than being undisputedly one of the top 5 offhands, it is a serious contender based on proc possibility + shielding + ac to be THE best offhander in the game for warriors at this point period.  <br />
<br />
Warriors end up with a very nice 1hander for the difficulty, paladin end up with a decent click on a weapon that will never be used for the purpose the devs made it, SK's got a bad click on a bad weapon.<br />
<br />
Oh, BB, those hybrid items you listed are &quot;casual&quot; gear as well, of which plenty good items exist for all classes.</div></div><hr />

At least this Warrior thinks Paladins asked for and got:<br />
New stuns effective vs. higher level mobs.<br />
<br />
Shields to be useful - their AC is not cap reduced and Shield Block has a chance to block.<br />
<br />
Avoidance/Mitigation - as Frodlin has pointed out 90 seconds of the heals landing on you being much more effective certainly comes quite close.<br />
<br />
Having asked for improvements in any one of the three catagories I listed to help with tanking, you got all three. Maybe you needed all of this - but having gotten it all, don't act like you're a neglected class.<br />
<br />
There is one minor sticking point, shields have been improved so much that many Paladins wish their epic was a 1Hndr.<br />
<br />
Fortunately, SoE has made the Epics inventory right-clickable for Paladins (they certainly didn't do it for Warrior - the assumption is we'll be weilding ours in the Offhand).<br />
<br />
Your Epic 1.5 is essentially a Diamond-tipped War Javelin (a really awesome DPS weapon from Uqua) which will do bucket loads of DPS with SU/Holyforge/Cleave III, very very nice DPS when not fighting undead, and has an AWESOME right-clickable from inventory effect you will use when MTing harder mobs with sword and board. Even if you choose to MT with it rather than take advantage of your awesome 1Hndrs and shield improvemnets, it's superior to VDD or GBoC.<br />
<br />
The Warrior *cough* Epic 1.5 is essentially a Hammer of the Timeweaver (PoTime) with a focus effect and right-click that could have been left out and not really changed it's desireability. Both HoT and EoE are offhanders, this is an offhander - depressing isn't it? At best this weapon meets half of a Warrrior's weapon needs at any given time. Lemme tell you, it's going to do jack for DPS with Savage Yawnslaught.<br />
<br />
Wanna trade epics? Warriors would probably gladly throw in the Provoke line. I'd happily right-click your epic from inventory. From inventory? I can't believe I said that - it's so much better than any DPS weapon I own, it's sick.<br />

Other than 1 parse done over a very short amount of time, there have been exactly 0 parses across TSW, PoN, Sony boards, guild parsing, my own logs, logs of other people I trust to run tests correctly that show shield AC is in any way different.<br />
<br />
<br />
Avoidance/Mitigation - as Frodlin has pointed out 90 seconds of the heals landing on you being much more effective certainly comes quite close.<br />
<br />
You mean 60 (72 with full aa's)?  You know that comes nowhere close to an avoid/mitigation effect for the same duration right?<br />
<br />
<br />
The Warrior Epic is a low dps, high defensive (shield3 + most ac/cha on any offhander currently in game) AND can hold 2 anger/yak procs... with a useless click and focus.  <br />
<br />
The paladin epic is a weapon that will be brought out for dps only by a very small amount of paladin (and dps for a paladin is a rare occurrance at best) and is good thanks to its click (and the focus, as well as the focus on 2.0 is already useless to anyone with a 40% [45% with the epic 2.0] healing focus).<br />
<br />
<br />
Do I want to trade? No, your epic doesnt do anything for me, as I cant offhand it ^^.  Would I trade Redemption for an offhander that can easily replace any other offhander currently in the game, or a 1hander with similar stats and a better ratio than HB? In a heartbeat.</div></div><hr />

You're right, it doesn't come close, it exceeds it in almost every single instance in EQ.    The more healers, the faster the heals, the more powerful.    The ONLY area where you still fall short is against SUPER high melee damage output encounters, of which there are a grand total of...<br />
<br />
Drumroll please....<br />
<br />
Zero in single group situations in Everquest today.   You were able to tank KodTaz/Ikkinz  nameds just fine with just level 70 pre-epic.   You werent' able to do it at 65, but at 70.... cake.   We were able to do it better.    This is how Everquest is supposed to work, we're supposed to be better than you at taking melee damage, quantified by the healing which keeps the tank alive.   In EVERY SINGLE situation EXCEPT mobs where 1 rounding is a significant possibility (which of course you cannot name a single one in Everquest today that's aimed at a single group), an epic paladin is now a better tank that a warrior at least for those 72 seconds every 10 minutes at ZERO mana, or endurance cost, at ZERO cost to DPS, with ZERO drawbacks... Jesus Christ you dont' even have to &quot;suffer through&quot; equipping the weapon for the 0.8 seconds it takes to cast the most powerful right click effect in the history of Everquest outside the cleric epic 1.0 (and it's REALLY close between those 2 anyhow now).<br />
<br />
That's only the case in life threatening situations, which are now non existent in EQ.   <br />
<br />
Try pulling the wool over someone else's eyes, it's not gonna fly here.</div></div><hr />

Lessee - um, a developer said it was? The tests were run basicly so we could get a feel for it and confirm it to our satisfation, not to dispute the developer. Are you suggesting otherwise?<br />
<br />
Look, it's obvious that Shield Block is a boon for knights. Warrior 1Hndrs are generally pretty pathetic since we get to dual wield. A Warrior loses offhand aggro procs when using a shield - knights aren't reliant on them for aggro.<br />
---------<br />
A Diamond-tipped War Javelin is an AWESOME weapon and it's a lot like your Epic 1.5, the Paladin right-click effect is SUPER. Clicking these Epics out of inventory IS a major boon for Paladins and I assure you near meaningless for Warriors.<br />
<br />
Only because of the paucity of quality Warrior offhanders does the Warrior Epic look good. Would you wield a weapon with the Warrrior Epic 1.5 DMG/DLY ratio with a shield? Would you bag a DBoW to use it?<br />
<br />
To be fair, those Warriors currently using Droga weapons and BoCs ARE going to love the 1.5 to death. Which should give some indication just how how rare decent DPS Warrior aggro weapons are pre-Time.<br />
<br />
Given the numbers of Paladins I've seen weilding Windblades and VDD's, I'd say a Diamond-tipped War Javelin with that right-click effect rocks from pre-EP's right on through Ugua. I agree a 1Hndr with this effect and Blade of Disruption-like ratio combined with AC, HP, and stat heavy/very useful shields would be better. A lot better. Gamebreakingly better.<br />
