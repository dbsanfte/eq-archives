<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Quicknx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Not sure if this question has been asked (sure it has but cant find it) <br />
<br />
Is a Stone Etched Mallet Good Agro with Anger III Aug ?<br />
<br />
I figure it would be with its rune II proc, But see more rangers, monks etc getting it then warriors.<br />
<br />
And I do not meat my guilds Prereq's for SEWS / BOW, My guild has more then just a set DKP price for those...6 month in guild, 500 dkp earned, 10k hp, 150 aa's blah blah blah.  Also we stay out of other expansions, so BF etc are out.<br />
<br />
Or is there some other weapon in my reach I'm not seeing ? <br />
JOS is nice, but out of reach.<br />
<br />
Also I have a BoC w/ Anger III <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grendonbb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">yes SEM is good with Anger III... I daresay any weapon is good with Anger III.<br />
<br />
As to what kind of weapons you're looking for, I can't really help you there.  SEM is nice, and if you don't qualify for SEWS/BoW... well... dunno what to tell ya.  Crow Footed Lance is a pretty nice 2 hander, but if you got your heart set on dual wielding, Jagged Shard of Frozen Flame off Jiva is pretty nice, 17/19 with nice stats and a 100ish dd proc I believe.  Stick anger 3 on it and you'll be about as good off as with SEM.<br />
<br />
Also, you could step down a bit, Bastion of Thunder towers GBoS is great for agro.  Blade of Carnage?  Bloodfrenzy?  All good agro of course, and if your other tanks are gettin BoW/SEWS, you may have a chance at grabbin one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dozan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have contemplated this question also.  Would like to hear from someone with first hand knowledge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Quato</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I use a ED Primary and SEM secondary.  Both have 125 hp Ykesha augs.  This set up is nice for damage and decent for aggro.  It is no raid MT set up but the SEM is a nice secondary weapon which will do fine holding aggro for most group situations.  I chose the Ykesha augs over anger augs because unless I am MT for a raid target I don't want to switch out my weapons.  The rune II is a handy effect but I don't think it generates much if any aggro at all.  Still as an offhand weapon I am sure you will be happy with it for quite some time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">personally i would wait for every ranger/rog/monk that wanted one to have one before i myself would roll on one.  its a good weapon, but it has dps written all over it in my book.  the proc is minimal aggro compared to a real aggro weapon, and its nice to toss pure dps a bone.<br />
<br />
a blade of carnage, or most any weapon 1 or 2 expansions ago would probably do ya much better for straight aggro purposes.<br />
<br />
that said, i would loot one for dps if nobody else wanted it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Used one offhand with a BoC and its was nothing special for agro.  After using a BBB for tanking and finding rune III to be decent agro the rune II proc on the SEM was quite disappointing.<br />
<br />
Im sure with an anger 3 aug it would be a fine offhander for tanking, theres certainly nothing wrong with it, but its nothing special either.</div></div><hr />
