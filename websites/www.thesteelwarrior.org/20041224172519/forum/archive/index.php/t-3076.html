<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thorbadin</div><div class="date">09-15-2003, 05:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why do you guys think mirror is any good actually?  Not sure what the numbers for them do exactly, but anyone know the % of return, does it return full dmg or only partial dmg, etc.  Proc also seem to last 3 ticks, so you need to proc and a spell need to come on you in the next 18 sec.  Totally useless against non caster.<br />
<br />
Could be good on boss assuming it work I guess.<br />
<br />
I would say sure if you could easily swap augments at the mirror.  But since you basically have only 1 choice of proc augment, seem to be something else might be more usefull.<br />
<br />
Which bring me to the #2 question.  What do you think about guard?  According to this foh thread : http://www.fohguild.org/forums/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=8839<br />
Guard is a rune that add 5% shielding for a total of 50(I) to 200(IV) dmg.  On an xp mob, guard 4 will work for like 50 hits.  On a boss mob, it might work for 6-8 hits depending on boss.<br />
<br />
It doesn't stack with Bullwark of Vie, a much more powerfull version that shield 10% for 1600 dmg (between 16-20 hits).  Since recast is very fast, it's possible to keep it all the time on the tank.<br />
<br />
So, since it seem that some tanks are going with this proc on their tank weapons, is it because it's something that &quot;might&quot; help?  Or Bulwark of Vie might just not be there all the time and 200 rune is better then nothing for that round?<br />
<br />
Please comment.<br />

Saving 200 damage (or more likely, 150, as the v4 of any aug seems to be unpurchaseable and liely a raid drop) to me is certainly not worth the loss of an aggro proc.<br />
<br />
However, I could seriously see Knights adding it to their weapons since they don't need aggro procs... and boom, there goes ost of the mitigation advantage warriors have.<br />

It's too early to tell the effects of Mirror effects, but I am quite interested in knowing the details behind up to Mirror 4.   I've used Mirror 1 for a few days, and while it rarely reflects, it does from time to time, last reflection was for full, a 760 point one.   <br />
<br />
I'm very interested in seeing the full effects of Mirror 4.</div></div><hr />

Edit: Mirror 4 gives 20% chance to reflect back to the caster, and Mirror 1 gives 5% chance if i read Lucy right. (base1, on the raw data page). This could be worth it, actually.</div></div><hr />

Though looking closer, I suppose it could be a typo substituting 'ire' for 'ice' and confusion between 'MM' meaning Mistmoor or Miragul's Menagerie. Both ags are listed seperately however /shrug</div></div><hr />

<br />
I mean lets face it BF &amp; 125DD+Stun is totally amazing.<br />
You can add 2x DD+Stun on any weapon combo.<br />
<br />
Lets see .....<br />
19/20 ac18 hp150 DD140 (cold) &amp; DD125+Stun  (Coirnav Hammer)<br />
18/19 ac15 hp155 DD100 (fire) &amp; DD125+Stun (Ifrir)<br />
29/30 ac20 hp155 Rune100 Heal80 &amp; DD125+Stun (TRC)<br />
<br />
Thats forgeting ...  Jiva 1HS, TRC 1HS, Agnaar 1HS, BF etc etc etc.<br />
<br />
This may help close down the gap of DPS 1H vs 2H.<br />
But the agro balance will be totally crazy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thorbadin</div><div class="date">09-17-2003, 03:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well 2-handers are supposed to proc more then 1-hander.<br />
<br />
You will get more total proc if you have 2 1-hander with 2 add proc then with 1 2-hander and 1 add proc but difference should be 50% or so not 100%.<br />
<br />
So in a way it's a small boost to 1-hander but obviously for 2 times the points.<br />
<br />
Like I pointed out in another thread, time weapons will require raid augment but we are looking at 3 dmg mod that work with any 1-h weapons (piercing too) and 10dmg mod that work with any 2-hander.<br />

<br />
What bothers me is with 2 weeks of 1 group farming.<br />
(And i'm beeing generous 2500 points is easy to get).<br />
<br />
With the current itemisation (agro wise):<br />
- The best EP combo, will beat or tie the best Time combo<br />
- The best non EP combo, will almost tie the best EP combo<br />
<br />
Get a BF, slap a stun on it. Get an Ifrir slap a stun on it.<br />
For some reason i have the feeling you'll get the same agro as DBoTW &amp; EoE<br />
<br />
Time weapons should be able to use Type 4 augments too.<br />
And have the privilege of beeing able to use Type 8 augments.<br />
<br />
LDoN Procs should be &quot;Type 4 and Type 8&quot;<br />
LDoN raid drops should be &quot;Type 8&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Killing FR and going XP for 1 week should not give you an EoE.<br />
Yet it does......</div></div><hr />

Augments are the easiest way ever to add new itemization into the game, It hasnt even been a month since LDON went live, I am not the most supportive of SoE's drag their feet policy, but the first post LDON patch is the 8th we should maybe wait for that to see what they add.</div></div><hr />

<br />
? Your analogy makes no sense.<br />
<br />
My QUESTION was, what about the 75 point lieftap proc makes it cost over 700 more points?<br />
<br />
Is it unresistable? Does it proc more? <br />
<br />
Or is it just 25 point hp difference, and a complete waste of time?<br />
<br />
And the only reason I bring it up in THIS particular thread is because the person who compiled the list had a cutoff for items based on how many adventure points they cost.<br />
<br />
I bring up the lifetap because at 340 points, it's a bargain, and probably should make the list because it's a useful proc augment.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sure it did, you just didn't understand it.<br />
<br />
Here's another analogy then.<br />
<br />
If your Fierce Heraldic bracer has 60hp, why would you pay 100k (or whatever) for a CT Acid bracer with 100hps? Why did you buy the FH one in the first place, when your crafted one had 20hp (or whatever). Why isn't the price gap between crafted/fh the same as fh/ct ? <br />
<br />
Furthermore, theres a 75dd proc for 100 points in Everfrost. Why bother with the 50 lifetap one? The point is, the higher you go, the more exponentially prices increase. <br />
<br />
Sure, the guy who takes a month to get the 50pt lifetap  will probably grab it, but they guy who can get the 75pt one in a week won't even look twice at the 50pt one.</div></div><hr />
