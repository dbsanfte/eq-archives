EQ Mini Q&amp;A #3<br />
With Alan Vancouvering, CM of EQ<br />
<br />
Lepidus: Warriors are a group that has been very vocal about problems with their class. Are there any plans to give special attention to the needs of this class or any other?<br />
<br />
Alan VanCouvering: We will be hosting a chat to discuss the changes we have in mind on November 24th. We will be doing something more than a just simple balancing pass. It's more of a melee combat system change. The goal is to make melee combat more interesting over all, to introduce a little more skill into the way a melee character is played, and to achieve the balance that we are always looking for.<br />
<br />
<br />
Lepidus: EverQuest II is going to release in the new year. There have been some plans for cross over elements between the two titles. How will this affect EQ players who choose not to play EQII? <br />
<br />
Alan VanCouvering: Yes, there will be some cross-over between the two games. But I can't give out any details about what they will be at this time. Maybe Moorgard can be convinced to spill the beans... <br />
<br />
<br />
Lepidus: Will there be an option added to turn off the jarring effects of melee classes? Many players complain it gives them a headache. <br />
<br />
Alan VanCouvering: Do you mean the animations that make a character move when it attacks? If so, then I'd have to say no, we don't have any plans to change the way the current set of PC animations work.<br />
