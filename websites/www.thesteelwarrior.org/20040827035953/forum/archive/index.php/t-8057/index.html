UPDATE: I am just starting to get more information on this. Here is what I've heard. <br />
<br />
We are currently no longer manufacturing or selling EQMac. However, we are looking into working with other distributors/retailers. The Store will be following up on this later this week. <br />
<br />
The reason has nothing to do with cancelling the game itself. Rather, it seems that the availability of the game is low, while the quantity of (theoretically) available copies is high. There should NOT be a shortage of EQMac given the number of units that were made vs. the number of units that were sold. This is also being looked into. <br />
<br />
Lastly, this is not a permanant decison, rather one based on simple economics. It seemed like an unnecessary drain on resources to pay to make more when we could simply move existing merchandise around to cover the demand. Should the number of available copies get low, and the demand for new ones increase, then obviously it would be beneficial to crank out more batches. Right now though, there are just so many units in the distribution centers that it would be silly to keep making more. What is already out there should cover demand for a LONG time. <br />
<br />
As others have mentioned, this doesn't seem to be the case, SOE is looking into it, and the Store will look into locating a suitable vendor in the interim. <br />
<br />
Again, please consider this news to be very &quot;beta.&quot; If it changes, I'll let you know. I just understand how eager everyone is for news, so I'm making an effort to let you know what I hear when I hear it. If I was misinformed, I will correct it in a future post. <br />
<br />
On a completely different topic, Vance asked a few posts back IF the game shut down, if I would miss our &quot;conversations.&quot; <br />
<br />
The answer, without sarcasm, is an unequivocable &quot;yes.&quot; Please bear in mind I've moderated EVERY SOE community there is: EQ, EQOA, EQMac, SWG, PS, CON, LOE, etc., etc., etc. While EQMac has come with a set of unique challenges, it was also the first time that not one but TWO community members took the time to figure out how to call me at work, just to tell me &quot;thank you for your time&quot; or &quot;have a good weekend.&quot; <br />
<br />
However, at this time, from what I've been told, it hasn't come to that. <br />

No, that's what you get for purchasing SOE's products.<br />
<br />
Blizzard's Mac support, by contrast, is much better. Too bad WoW (at least for the time being) sucks...<br />
<br />
I know Mac bashing is the cool thing to do, but this is an EQ forum, and Mac EQ is just that, EQ. But I digress. Looks like they're mainly clearing inventory. It appears they are currently looking into implementing some of the Guild Summit changes on Al'Kabor (the Mac server), so it ain't all bad news.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Alisdahre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I use A Mac because i know it's better than windows. Also we get about 99.9% less viruses than PC.<br />
<br />
/shrug, I use PCs because I know they're better than Macs.  Matter of opinion.  I have also gotten only 2 viruses in the entire 21 years I've been using computers, I always thought they were pretty easy to avoid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gyrfalcon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The reason why this is so important is because one of the most relevant things to come out of the so-called &quot;summit&quot; was SOE's commitment to EQMac. If, instead, we see that SOE decides to end te product (and eventually the server) it shows in spades exactly what all of SOE's customer base should expect from this company. That they are more than willing to string their customers along with promises that not only don't make their appearance, but the product is eliminated altogether.<br />
<br />
Think about all those other wonderful promises that SOE made at the summit. Sure, right now we are seeing some facia changes THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN MADE YEARS AGO, but what about the bigger issues? What assurance (other than SOE's word) do we have that they will be addressed?<br />
<br />
So. The ball is in SOE's court. All customers are waiting to see how the company deals with this portion of it's customer base. Will SOE do right and keep their word, or will they just cut off this irrepairable and unprofitable portion of their business.<br />
<br />
As a long time Mac user (graphic artist) I know exactly how loyal the Mac community is. These people will stick with a product through tick and thin as long as they feel the product is superior to everything else out there. But most importantly, these people are already paying a premium for their computers in the first place. Sure, there are a lot like me who work on Macs and play on PCs. But those diehard few who are willing to persist actually wait for a game release on the Mac platform rather than play on a PC.<br />
<br />
You know, what surprises me is that SOE has put out a Mac product, but has not moved forward with a Linux release of EQ. As the underpinnings on the Mac are Unix, it would seem that difficult to port the client over into a Linux environment. Granted, you will have to run a separate patch server (or modify the current on for Mac) to support Linux patching, but the S3D object files should all be the same (Mac and Linux both use OpenGL). Only the executables would have to be modified to any greater degree for the proper CPU calls (and any executables that madke direct use of OS X only APIs), and most code compilers built for Mac OS X are designed to complie for X86 as well as PowerPC. SOE might actually see a population explosion on the Mac server if they were actually able to port the client.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Arathena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Many of those who really want to play EQ on Linux are already doing it. The Windows environment (WineX) software has advanced by leaps and bounds in recent times, and it is comparatively easy to create an environment on Linux that will run Everquest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yep, EQ runs on linux, every now and then DX changes in EQ breaks compatibility, but for the most part, you can play on linux without a problem.<br />
<br />
BTW, EQmac has NOT been discontinued. They are just changing distibution channels to better deal with the current stock of merchandise already available. Reading comprehension is a valuable tool..learn it.</div></div><hr />

Just shows ya dont buy mac if you are into gaming</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gyrfalcon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Arathena, I am quite well aware of the WineX project and how far it has come. You still have the issue that it is at the root an emulation of Windows APIs and then translating them into API calls in the Linux environment. Not an easy thing when you are talking about porting DirectX instruction sets and then using a table to translate them into OpenGL instructions. Going through this process, any game running in WineX is lucky to get even 40% performance throughput of what a Windows user would experience on the same hardware, and the Windows user doesn't have to enjoy all those lovely artifact issues that crop up from time to time. While this is usable for most business applications, trust me, for gamers, it really sucks. Also, it must be pure hell for project programmers whenever Microsoft updates it's API sets (such as DirectX).<br />
<br />
What I am talking about is a completely different animal. A version of EQ that runs NATIVE to linux (like they did for the Macintosh) and makes use of OpenGL native to the environment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">heh my roomate uses a mac not for eq, anyway he was telling me all about how macs are all better and stuff. then 5 seconds later it locked up. it was like murphy walked into the room in person i tell you.<br />
<br />
several minuets of lol ensued.</div></div><hr />

Yes, they're clearing existing inventory and are going to put up a link to EBgames and other distribution channels on the page that they used to sell EQMac through -- however there was no official statement of that happening when Roneb initially posted here, just a &quot;Discontinued&quot; badge on the Station store. Just thought I'd clear that up.<br />
<br />
I think it speaks loads though when their CSR's had no clue what was going on when asked about the matter. They're clueless about what the corporate suits at Sony are doing or planning to do, regardless of which EQ version (Mac or Win) you're talking about...  :)</div></div><hr />
