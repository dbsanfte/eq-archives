<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">feffil</div><div class="date">10-12-2003, 06:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have run into conflicting information on how dual wield works. For example does the speed of the secondary weapon matter or does it just go off when dual wield is succesfull. I know this may be a newbie question but I would appreciate some help. Also thanks for any help</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tarkas</div><div class="date">10-12-2003, 06:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Both swing independently, speed is more useful in mainhand for dmg bonus dps. Offhand speed does not factor into it so just go with best ratio.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Prytty</div><div class="date">10-12-2003, 10:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tarkas is correct....Primary and 2ndary weapons swing indpendently from each other.  For a brief example, lets say you have a 20 delay weapon in mainhand and a 24 delay in offhand.<br />
<br />
When you press auto-attack, every 2.0 seconds (assuming no haste for simplicity) your primary weapon will swing.  Every 2.4 seconds the combat engine will make a check vs your duel wield skill.  If the check is successful, your offhand weapon will swing.<br />
<br />
What happens with your mainhand does not affect what goes on with your offhand in any way. If you want to prove it to yourself, get two onehanders of vastly different speeds and of two different attack types i.e. slash and bash.  Watch the battle spam and you'll see how it works.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tarkas, are you saying that delay of an offhand weapon does not factor in when you swing your offhand?</div></div><hr />

2,4 secs was taken cause it was a 24 dly wep (if it was 28 dly wep it would have been 2,8 secs).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">10-13-2003, 06:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">He means the offhand delay isn't as important as the mainhand delay due to lack of damage bonus on offhand.  It's still nice to have a decent delay on offhand, but it doesn't have a bonus so you need to focus more on ratio than speed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Keane Abrams</div><div class="date">10-13-2003, 07:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just wanted a clarification. I don't want anyone thinking that a 20 delay weapon in their offhand will swing the same times as a 30 delay weapon.</div></div><hr />
