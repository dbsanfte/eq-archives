I just recently turned 63, and have noticed I'm getting invited to more tier2/3 groups lately :)   However, these mobs seem to beat the holy hell outta me, and I'm wondering if I should stop leveling and build some defensive AA. My gear isnt uber, but not bad with a mixture of ss and thurg armor.  In most exp groups im usually buffed to 6k hp's and 1240 ac.<br />
The only aa in arch I have is CS1.<br />
So would you go ahead and grind out to 65? or get some defensive AA to take hits better?<br />
<br />
thanks for advice.</div></div><hr />

No question. 10 AA doesn't net you a whole lot of defensive AA, but it's the same as 2 regular levels, which will help you tons more (plus get you more groups).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">08-13-2003, 12:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Level.  The difference I saw going from level 59 tanking in valor to 65 tanking in valor was huge.  Basically went from a cleric chaincasting CH on me to a shaman being our only healer/slower in the group and having no trouble at all.  <br />
<br />
Also if people see a 65 and a 63 warrior LFG, they will take the 65 every time, and they won't ask him how many aas he has.</div></div><hr />

For that amount of exp you are getting higher stats caps, a better taunt button, better chance at resisting spells/AEs, lower agro radius for pulling and safer travel, and more base HP. You could buy AA skills to achieve the same thing (for more than 10aa I might add), but the better chance to taunt and lower agro radius are only available by levelling.<br />

Level &gt; AA</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">08-13-2003, 03:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A month ago, I would have had a very different opinion on the matter, and in fact, if you do a search, you'll find a ton of posts from me advocating pounding out some AA's at 60.<br />
<br />
I still do believe that's the way to go if you want to avoid the shitpile that is PoP (and with the new Droga, that is definitely an option these days), but I will say this :<br />
<br />
Level 65 is pretty goddamned amazing.  I can take both my toons and 2 box in HoT now, whereas at 60, i'd need at least one CH before I even got the mob slowed.  I'm obviously above and beyond what you're going to be at when you hit 65 due to the AA count I have, but the difference is very noticable.<br />
<br />
If you enjoy PoP and can get a high XP rate, then by all means, hit 65.  It'll be better for you in the long run.</div></div><hr />

Ah yes, memories.  My first Valor group, had just gotten a GSoT and was all proud.  I was 61 and got an WW group doing golems.  After about an hour, as I was marvelling at how fast exp was coming in, the cleric asks me if it was possible to crip with my GSoT, as I had not, 'and I have given you TONS of chances'.  I dinged 65 at same spot, by then, with no more AA's, I was taking at most 2 heals a fight.  Difference was night and day.  Mana sink to fairly efficient tank.</div></div><hr />

As a couple others have already said, the difference in tanking a mob at 60 and tanking it again at 65 is a real eye-opener.</div></div><hr />
