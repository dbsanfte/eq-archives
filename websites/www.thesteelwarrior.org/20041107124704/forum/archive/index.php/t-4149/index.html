<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jarrae Halliwax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is it just me or is something screwy here - my chanters about ready to keep me permamezzed.<br />
<br />
It seems lately, I'll target the incoming mob (or use an /assist key on the monk), announce the target, attack, then find myself on the wrong mob.<br />
<br />
At first I thought it was me, but it is happening too often.  Then something really interesting happend the other night.  We pulled 3 mobs (call them A, Band C).  Everyone attacked &quot;A&quot; and the chanter mezzed &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot;.  &quot;A&quot; died and the chanter asked us to attack &quot;C&quot;.  I pressed my assist key which was currenty hardcoded to assist the enchanter and my target switched from &quot;B&quot; to &quot;C&quot; then immediatly back to &quot;B&quot;.  It did this 3 times in a row.<br />
<br />
Anyone else experiencing this or know how to fix it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kaldanm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">They added a key working like F8 recently, check in the option menu, maybe your macro button is screwed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kizef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">2 patches ago they made the ~ key work just like the F8 key.<br />
<br />
Go under keyboard in your options window.<br />
Under the target menu.<br />
Find &quot;target nearest mob&quot; Next to that it should have F8 and ~ as main and alt keys.<br />
Click the ~ then press ESC. it will cancel the ~.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>faederya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">This happened to me a couple also.  I believe that the made targetting mobs easier and when I use the mouse to turn it is grabbing the mob that my cursor moved across while turning and now I have a new target.<br />
<br />
This is just my hunch though...  You can test it easily, target someone in PoK, turn by using the mouse, grab the left side of the screen and drag it to the right side of the screen.  Make sure you drag your mouse across a PC / NPC and they should be the new target focus.<br />
