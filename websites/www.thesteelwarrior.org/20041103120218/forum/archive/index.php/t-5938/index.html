<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Agrok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hiya I am sure i probally missed this being discussed but my question is,<br />
<br />
For my warrior i was wondering if a wmbs 31/28 or the windblade 50/44 is better for aggro ?  my gut tells me Windblade for the burst dmg But i know by the delay wmbs does more dps  can someone that has tried both let me know ? <br />
<br />
Thank you alot <br />
<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>shadowedspawn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have never used a Windblade but I did use a WMBS for a long time.  I belive it would help more w/ agro as your getting more swings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hormadrune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've used both- negligible agro difference between them really. WMBS might have a slight edge, but nothing worth worrying about really. Neither weapon, unless aug'd, is an especially good agro weap but they're servicable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You'll get more mileage aggrowise out of a GSoT, and the DPS is about the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Drunder50</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I was in a PoV group awhile ago where my pally friend was parsing DPS for one of the melee in the group and they both had pretty much the same DPS.  Not a big difference at all. Not sure how the aggro played into all that.  Someone mentioned the The GSoT. If aggro is what you are concerned with, get one.. they are fairly cheap and is 30/31 with a nice proc. Nort sure what level you are but you can equip the GSoT at 55.</div></div><hr />
