<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Starting a thread that will be edited on what actually make sense in terms of taunt changes to improve WARRIORS. (no fucking comments about paladins or sk this is warrior only thread). Suggestions only no bashing if someone already posted that idea do not repost same shit. If you do not agree with idea say why in detail. I dont really care about agro for lvl 1-50 those levels fly. Keep it civil, no bashing.<br />
<br />
My personal opinions.<br />
<br />
1. Make it so lvl 51-60 warrior can hold agro on Tier 1 pop mobs. (as I understand this is big issue) Meaning increase lvl difference between player and lvl of mob he can taunt Tier one plane mobs. (Maybe remove the level cap on taunt all together or cap it for all players as works on mobs of lvl &lt;71)<br />
<br />
2. Do not grey out Taunt on too far away message.<br />
<br />
3. Make AE taunt to put you on the top of agro list + agro of a little over one CH. Because clerics usually about to CH you when you need to AE taunt and he rips that agro right off you with that.... happens often.<br />
<br />
4. lvl 60-65 discs that give us utility in xp groups (I don’t have ideas atm)<br />
<br />
5. put defensive/evasive on separate timer...<br />
<br />
6. all/all items screw HIGH END warriors please adjust the balance... (I think this better left to developers to tinker with)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vanax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">At level 55 (iirc) warriors get stun added to their kicks...AFAIK this stun doesnt really add any aggro similar to a stun spell. I believe people earlier have posted about adding like a .5 stun factor or something along those lines similar to the stun proc of like a BBoE or a SoD for aggro purposes...I have no clue how a developer would do this, but I remember it being mentioned b4 so I figured I would bring it up..</div></div><hr />

I thought they took that out so you could taunt reds... a LONG time ago.</div></div><hr />

then people would use it on raids at the start of the encounter and there would be no agro risk for debuffing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">lol CH is no where near the agro of any debuff Ranakor CH is pretty damn low agro.<br />
<br />
Binnamar /shrug. All I know warriors say that they cant hold agro well in Tier one planes when xping from 50-60. 60-65 I dont buy it. 50-60 I have no way of knowing I have never xped in planes at those levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">lol no one has any sugestions or comments how wonderfull. All ppl do is bitch. (plz dont start I dont bitch blah blah blah here :)</div></div><hr />

This one pisses me off more than anything. I'd love to see it get fixed.</div></div><hr />

I have actually been tanking 95% of the time from level 53-59 thus far in Tier 1 zones.  My experiences have mostly been good and little bad, per usual.  However, far as aggro goes i've noticed it really is not that hard to keep it at this level in tier 1 zone.  From my observations of various groups i've been in, the main issue with keeping aggro is the fact that the group does not work well together to start off with.  <br />
Early slows, debuffs or chain casting of spell classes really are a detriment to a warrior keeping aggro.   I also notice most warriors do not disarm(every little bit helps) or use /shield when engaged which helps return aggro to them.  PoD on the other hand seems to not matter what a warrior does, casters always get the beat down cause nothing seems to work especially in LCY/RCY camps by the castle.<br />
<br />
Edit (hit submit to early) - Another problem i noticed is the weapons a warrior is attempting to keep aggro with are pretty worthless in the PoP zones.</div></div><hr />
