<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">curather</div><div class="date">11-22-2004, 09:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am a level 12 Warrior in freeport and I am still using the citizenship weapon since I use a shield.  Is there any better weapons that can go along with a shield, I can't seem to find any.  All the weapons I look on the merchant are the same dmg as the freeport citizenship weapon or the 2 quests that I did in freeport for weapons are actually worse than the freeport citizenship weapon.  Thanks for any help.<br />

I would work on maxing your crush and piercing though, because later on you never know what weapons will be good later on.  Most are comparable anyways.<br />
<br />
If you are realy interested though, Just go to a broker and do a search for what is availble.  I have run across very few items that are no drop, so most should be for sale by now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Think I ended up ditching my citizenship dagger at around 12, so if you can't find a suitable weapon through questing, the brokers are a good place to check.</div></div><hr />

Think you need to kill 15-20.  Should be orangeish to you, so with a decent group of your level you should be fine.  Reward is a doom stick.  Decent stat 1 hb, non dual wield so will go with your shield and it's pretty nice upgrade to citizenship weapon.  Alternatively, they sell for about 5 silver on market (on kithicor anyway)<br />
