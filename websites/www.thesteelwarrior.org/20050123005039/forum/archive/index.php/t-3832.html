<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Galdaen</div><div class="date">10-23-2003, 04:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you are a follower of Rallos Zek, you can't go wrong with fierce heraldic armor pieces if you can find it at a price that you can afford.  It is player made, so if you know a GM human smith, you might be able to cut a deal with them if you collect the items for the combines.  That armor will take you a long way, and a lot of us still wear a few pieces at 65 still....until we can get upgrades that is. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kandidar</div><div class="date">10-23-2003, 05:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I knew a diety was in my best intrest when I made this warrior but what is a warrior with out challanges right, so no I am agnostic and may regret it sometimes but its a small price to keep me interested :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Noctix</div><div class="date">10-23-2003, 05:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think your hp are a little low, your ac is fine.<br />
<br />
In addition to the suggestion about Fierce, here are a few more suggestions.  I'm not a warrior but I spend a ton of time in the E'ci bazaar so I know the prices pretty well.<br />
<br />
Chest- Architects Bejeweled Chestplate (10k)<br />
Hands- Blood Runed Gauntlets (6k)<br />
Ears-Earring of Solstice (3k for the components), Mosquito Leg Earring (10k), Jagged Bone Hoop (500pp)<br />
Finger-Valorium Rings (6-7k)<br />
Primary-Sword of the Bloodsworn (6k), Greatstaff of Thunder (300pp, when you hit lvl 55)<br />
<br />
Also, you don't have a haste item.  Get an FBSS, SCHW, or something better ASAP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kandidar</div><div class="date">10-23-2003, 05:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow thanks for that information, I need to get the SCHW just when I am on they arnt LOL. I will have to look up the other items you mentioned, this is gooooood imput anyone got anymore?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Galdaen</div><div class="date">10-23-2003, 05:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Neck:  ANYTHING for an improvement.  Clattering bone necklace are reasonably priced and would do you well for a while.<br />
<br />
I am not sure if the fine heraldic stuff is any good, but you might want to check it out as well.  Not nearly as good as the fierce heraldic, but worth taking a look at I would guess.<br />
<br />
I am also guessing that the Thurgadin quest armor might be upgrades for you in some slots as well and the faction for that armor is easy to come by if you do not have it already.  You could probably find some of those pieces to have MQd to you relatively cheaply if you have the needed faction.  I can't remember which pieces are worthwhile, but you can always look it up and see.<br />
<br />
If people are like me, I have a few stray pieces of the quest armors from Kael and HoT laying around colelcting dust in my bank, so you might be able to get lucky and find some rather cheaply.<br />
<br />
As has already been mentioned, get some haste ASAP first thing!<br />
<br />
I would recommend that you just do some searches in the bazaar mainly looking for hit points and then see what else is on the item...hp/AC/sta combos should be your focus.  Try upgrading your weakest areas first, because those will make the biggest improvement for you...such as your neck slot. ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
some of that isnn't half bad.  Anothing thing to check is getting some friends, and working on maybe getting thurrg quest armour.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A velium black saphire necklace with a stamina aug blows this out of the water hp wise.</div></div><hr />
