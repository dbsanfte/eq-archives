<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thalzaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">nope, he's the same as ever. I was lazy and never did my epic and didn't feel like draggin folks around so i found him up after raid night one night and did it with a group. Hard part is finding him up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>zeeko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I believe his respawn is 24 hours btw, so it's not that tought to catch him up as he's not an easily farmable mob if  you don't have a kickass group.  Taking him down isn't that tough if you have a full group with a charming enchanter to get some extra DPS or you're time geared.  A cleric + patch healer are more then enough and a single cleric group again might be enough if your gear is good enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I did him the other night with 4 people + 1 bot.  It was me, my cleric bot, a real cleric, a ranger, and a paladin.  Basically, the real cleric healed me, my bot healed rampage on the pally and spot-healed on me a couple times, and the ranger trueshotted him.  I opened with furious and then used stonewall.  He died a few seconds after stonewall wore off.  I was probably the best-geared character there, with the others (except for my bot) in a mix of elemental and lower items.  Wasn't easy, and I came close to dying quite a few times, but he went down on the first try.  I had gone down earlier with just me and the cleric bot to see how hard he was and managed to keep myself alive just chaining CH until stonewall wore off, so if you have a decent tank and enough dps to kill him in under 3 minutes a 1-healer group is definitely viable.  Range DPS is important on this fight if you don't have a charmed pet.  Too many melees and healing rampage becomes difficult.  Rangers and nukers are the best damage dealers for him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cronos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I did him with my 4 (war clr, enc, wiz) and a friend (bst,wiz) with not much elemental gear and not using charm pet<br />
don't really need a second healer since rampage is ae, so just make it ranged fight<br />
key part is positioning since there is about 4 roamers that go thru his room<br />
just use furious and then stonewall/defensive<br />
with some dps shouldn't be a long fight<br />
if chain ch will be fast enough depends mostly on the tanks gear/aas and was bit too  risky in my opinion, so just went for quick heals and had no issue with mana<br />
<br />
edit: btw my magelo is quite outdated</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nazgrub</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yah, did this hit last night.  I scouted him and asked if anyone in the guild could help, was expecting a group, ended up getting 15 people and it was a joke.  Oh well, at least I know people were willing to come help  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>ibithor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">did him with my cleric bot, a druid with charmed boar, ench with charmed pet and her cleric bot. pretty easy fight really</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Spikela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Did him with 9. Cleric, druid, me, 3 wizzies, ranger, enchanter and beast. Was a bad, bad joke with 3 wizzies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ichkabibel2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">i regularly farm him with war/cle/enc .. frenzied initiates work best cuz they can kill overseer before his rampage damage kills them, they do nutty dps when hasted.</div></div><hr />
