She really isnt all that underpowered in current form, but then again it seems like she was ninja fixed after the first kill by Novae.  The rumor is that once you kill taskmistress in riwwi the 2 pixxt in the stands of the arena come targetable and drop parts to the bane weaps.  I was given the name of the weapons last night but i cant remember off the top of my head atm, it was finished something starting with an N.</div></div><hr />

She is different on each server.  She is still in her original form on kane bayle so you should be a bit hesitant before you make a statement like that ^_~</div></div><hr />

She was changed, she doesnt mitigate weapon damage anymore and her regen was cut significantly.  She spawns at midnight game time and despawns at 4 am~</div></div><hr />

<br />
First off she mitigates about 20% of blunt, but doesnt seem to mitigate piercing and h2h(like originally) and doesnt seem to mitigate slashing either.  But if she was made to mitigate 50% they better up the stats on her quest drops because they are pretty much in line with her difficulty, at least on tallon.  Especially given the 20 minute window that she is up, and the 60 minute wait time for her to repop + the uqua part of the quest.  I reallly dont see a non uqua guild killing her, her regen is just too high.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Cragbeast Queen was indeed toned down more than I would have liked. She'll put up more of a fight after we next update Natimbi, and it should be immediately apparent what aspect of the fight wasn't working correctly.<br />
<br />
The face item quest is in and working, but I'll admit the clue you get from Mudarik is vague at best. Upcoming Natimbi update will also include another hint from the Aletipping dorf.<br />

Grats to those that have successfully killed the Cragbeast while she's having a bad week.  <br />

The fact that in order to get loot from CQ you need to be in Uqua, didn't clue you in on that intent?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was using the statement to say that with all of the constraints on killing queen + the fact that you need a uqua part, the encounter is fairly balanced.  Queen isnt totally trival, but she is pretty easy, however for her loot, which really isnt anything special aside from the 50 ac 240 hp range she is pretty much in balance at the moment.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't believe anyone said you did. <br />
<br />
You do however need to be IN Uqua (hence an Uqua guild, as oppsed to a non-Uqua guild) in order to get the Beacon/Rings from Uqua<br />
<br />
As it stands, CQ is the best risk/reward per hour in the game. We plan to spend half an hour waxing her on the way to Kod whenever she pops.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You really cant spend half an hour on the way since she only spawns every 70 minutes and you need to plan your raid to be there + buff + prep before hand.  Assume you raid at 6pm est, and that happens to be 10 am game time.  That means you are forced to sit in natimbi for close to an hour before she spawns, pushing back your raid time to about 730 once you get the newbies cohed + the competent people run through kod taz.  As for best risk reward?  Quarm is far easier and takes about 10 mins of prep time + 5-6 mins to kill him.  You can talk about the 4 hours it takes to get to him but the loot alone, even if it goes to apps is worth it.  Now if you want to say she is the best risk reward mob in god, that is a possibility.  About an hour to kill her + 3ish hours in uqua killing until you get the items you need to complete the quest + the fact that uqua is a bottleneck in the quest.  Doesnt make her sound all that cheery now does it ~  My point is simply, yes she is very very doable by any uqua enabled guild, but the timesink and bottleneck to complete the other quest pieces in uqua + the time sink waiting for the mob to spawn in natimbi brings her risk/time pretty much in line with the norm.</div></div><hr />

Due to spawn at 6:22pm? Meet there around 6pm, group and MGB. Spawns exactly on time, and 5 minutes later you're looting her. Due to spawn at 7:02pm? Meet at 5:30 instead and catch the 5:50pm spawn. It ain't rocket science.</div></div><hr />

The point is while you wait you are wasting time which adds to your (30 minutes) of kill time.  Opportunity costs~ If you are waiting on cragbeast you arnt doing something else, therefore the time spent waiting is included in your l33tz risk/time calculation.  Unless you know a whole lot of 30 minute encounters were you get your guild to a zone in 10 mins..do encounter in 10 mins..then get back to beast + prep in 10 mins!!  Didnt think so.  She spawns at 7 pm thats already an hour or normal raid time gone, so your 30 mins of l33tz farming is now 60 mins which makes her far more in line with the other gimp mobs that drop loot similar to hers.  And yes her loot really isnt anything special aside from the 50 ac range.  Most is in line with tier 5 time + a cool new effect which really doesnt do much of anything ala 5% self spell haste that is eaten by bor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Huh? What part didn't you understand?<br />
<br />
You don't wait. You show up at a time where there isn't any waiting. You don't think 'Oh, she spawns at 7:15, so let's get there at 7:20 and sit around for an hour'<br />

I don't know what changes have been made since we killed her after novae, but she was quite trivial. Everyone was standing around after she died kinda going &quot;huh?&quot;.<br />
<br />
But, prathun popped up after our kill also and said that she was gimped too much and he was retuning her right then - so she could be a lot different now.</div></div><hr />

Are you that clueless to the outside world that you realize people who play eq have lives?  We have a set raid time for 1 reason and 1 reason only..because people have jobs, you know the things that people go to to pay their bills and provide for their families?  I know you are apparantly blind to the real world but telling your boss I need to get out a half hour early today because i need to be in natimbi to kill the cragbeast queen doesnt work very well.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
The point is that her risk/time is lessened by a decrease in her availability therefore she needs to be a bit easier than a mob dropping similar loot that is always up and always engageable.  Im not saying that she isnt too easy, but im saying as far ass the best rvr mob in the game, she isnt top by a long shot if you count the total time involved in A killing her + praying the items you need in uqua drop.  In fact you can easily clear time in about the same duration it would take for all of the pieces to drop in uqua assuming you are lucky, making quarm a much higher rvr mob since you get the drops along the way even if you only include tier 5.  Simply put the encounter is very close to what it should be.<br />
<br />
Im not complaining about the encounter, in fact its fun as hell.  But when you take into consideration the constraints placed on doing the quest as compared to a mob that drops loot, you pick it up and equip it, the event is tuned fairly comparible to others of equal loot value.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dunno how it works in your guild, by in our guild ( when i say our im referring to Demorgoth and my guild ), if we KNOW for certain the cragbeast is going to spawn at 7:30 EST, we schedule the raid to meet at 7:15 est.  <br />
<br />
Now listen closely.  We all arrive at 7:15 EST, we buff up and move into position, this takes probably about 10 minutes.  We make a quick MT order and then hang out for maybe a minute or two tops, then she spawns!!<br />
<br />
Once she spawns we kill her, and then do the loot, by the time the loot is done, its about 7:45.  Boom, 30 minutes.<br />
<br />
Whats so hard to understand here? Its that simple.  We know the times when our members are out of work ( we are an EST guild ) and we schedule raids when we know everyone can attend.  Cragbeast Queen takes 30 mins from absolute start to absolute finish.  Your relating it to Quarm isnt even in the same ballpark because of the clear time.  Killing Quarm takes 4 and a half hours absolute start to absolute finish if you are flying.  <br />
<br />
Demorgoth's comment that its the best loot you can get in under an hour was obviously referring to your starting and finishing time of 30 minutes.  <br />

Clearly you lack the incompetence to get the point.  The point is this, we raid at 6 pm est every day ok do you follow me?  Now ok fine she spawns at 730 we get there at 715 and kill her.  Now einstein we have wasted an hour and 15 mins waiting for her to spawn where we could be doing something else.  That time waiting has to be attributed to the queen event because there are none (NOT ONE) encounter in all of god that you can pull off in that time minus priest in kod, and thats not worth doing.  How maybe if you read what im tying that little brain of yours can comprehend the fact that waiting for her to spawn forces you to vary your raid schedule and push it back as much as an hour and a half.  If you had any education whatsoever you would realize that the price of a mob is equal to that directly related to the mob and that which is foregone in the effort to kill the mob.  Take an econ class one day if you make it to college and learn about opportunity costs.<br />
<br />
Edit it is also not the best loot you can get in an hour because she drops no loot.  You have to consider the time it takes in uqua to get the accompanying items to drop.  I know this is a really really difficult concept for you to understand but one day you will get it, just keep trying!<br />
<br />
You also have to realize that the quest items ONLY drop in uqua.  How many guilds that you know of want to go back to uqua just to farm quest pieces after they have cleared it 3 times and have the guild flagged?  Ill give you 3 guesses and if you guess anything other than 0 im going to smack the shit out of you.  Uqua sucks, everyone is sick of it.  If you think guilds are going to go back in it after they are done flagging you are sadly mistaken.  That fact alone makes cragbeast queen 100% worthless to the 40 or so high end guilds who are about to finish with uqua and move on.</div></div><hr />

Oh for fucks sake, its all relative man, if you raid at 6, then kill her at 6:30 instead of 7:30, if she spawns at 7:30 that means she spawns an hour previous at 6:30.<br />
<br />
Or better yet, dont kill her at all if you think its too much of a waste of time.  The point was, WE ( IE: our guild ), can kill her in 30 mins on the way to our raid.  That makes it a great risk / reward / time spent mob.  <br />

It will work for some guilds ( re: us ), and it wont for others ( re: you ).</div></div><hr />

Guess what Aspit, nobody gives a crap about when your guild raids, or about how inflexable you/your guild are. It doesn't have to be that way, and it isn't that way for everyone. If you and your guild choose to run things like that, then fine. But stfu and don't try to act like anybody else gives a shit.</div></div><hr />

Imo, the second barxt was just as intense as the first. To raid inku'ta theres lockouts, ikkinz theres lockouts, uqua, etc. Theres respawn times in qvic, and there's a respawn time on the cragbeast. Time is a bore and has 9/10 rots -- what else are you going to do? Ldon? lol...<br />
