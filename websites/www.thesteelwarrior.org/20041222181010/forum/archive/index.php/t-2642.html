<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gimmel</div><div class="date">08-20-2003, 02:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We all know the evils of mashing the taunt button (I hope). It has been brought up that a possible exception to this is when tanking in a raid situation, where it may be possible for a person to have more hate than you and not have agro because of proximity, and since you can’t know exactly when this is happening, mashing my be the best way to piggy back up in agro.<br />
<br />
After reading a few enchanter posts, I realized that there could be another situation in which it is helpful, when using a charmed pet in the group. Enchanters have noted that if they send in a hasted charmed pet, one that is doing massive dps, they really don’t have agro problems regardless of tank class, because the pet is actually keeping agro on the tank. The pet has generated a huge amount of agro from doing major dps, but the mob still hits the warrior, because a mob will always hit an NPC over a charmed pet if one is in melee range. Of course, if charm breaks, then the agro from the charmed pet poofs, and the mobs may start going after debuffers and damage dealers, unless the tank taunts. When he taunts, he may be able to piggyback on the pet’s agro, and prevent the mob (not the charmed one) from going after others if charm breaks. In this case, mashing taunt may very well be advantageous.<br />
<br />
A fairly specialized situation, to be sure, but thought I would bring it up. I found the idea of using charmed pets to help with agro very interesting.</div></div><hr />

We all know the evils of mashing the taunt button (I hope). <br />
I've actually always been a taunt button masher, never had any issue or problem w/ it aside from a bit of extra spam on some npcs.  I do constantly when MTing and in exp groups, basically any time I want the mob hitting me instead of someone else.<br />
<br />
So, I tend to agree with the post above; we actually make it a point to &quot;clone&quot; aggro periodocally during some fights, just to make sure that the backup tank gets eaten if the MT dies, instead of the cheal line.  Works great, especially on the marathon million hp mobs.  If you wait till the MT dies, you lose the (sometimes HUGE) built up aggro he has... a periodic taunt (while not attacking so it switches back immediately) by a backup tank locks in the aggro and sets the him up as vice president... mostly useless, but a heartbeat away from prime time. ;)<br />
<br />
RdT.</div></div><hr />

haha.. nice analogy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">08-20-2003, 04:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've said it before, about 3-4 times already, and I'll say it again.<br />
<br />
Beastlords are your friends!<br />
<br />
That technique doesn't just work on charmed pets, it works on ALL pets.  Pets cannot be MT while any PC is in range.  Pets hold their own spot on the hate list, meaning they can be above you on the list, but as long as the pet's owner isn't in range, it'll attack you instead.<br />
<br />
Why beastlords, you ask?  Why not necro or mage pets?<br />
<br />
Two reasons:<br />
<br />
1) Beastlord pets are designed to hold aggro.  BSTs get a line of procs which not only do damage, but add hate as well.  The higher versions (51+) have a stun as well.  The reason this technique is also noticed on charmed pets is because charmed pets do a lot of damage, which gets aggro.  Beastlord pets proc...a lot.  Spirit of the Storm, the 53 pet proc, has a 200 hate increase, and a 1.5 sec stun.  It goes off...a lot.<br />
<br />
I group with a chanter, and she dies fast on a resisted slow.  She learned that after seeing two procs, it's pretty much safe to slow, because even if the warrior can't hold aggro, the pet will.<br />
<br />
2) Beastlords can slow, and guess where they'll most likely be while they're slowing.  Yup, right next to you, or at least in range, because they're going to be attacking as well.  This is a personal annoyance of mine, but it's much easier to regain aggro if you're not chasing it halfway across the zone to the slower.  They can also live longer on a resist, thanks to their mini-stonestance disc they get at 55.<br />
<br />
Pets are your friends, remember that...just make sure the owner isn't sitting when the pet first attacks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">08-20-2003, 05:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You are right about the charm pet taunt mashing.  The question is, if an enchanter has a CoD pet, why are they letting the gimp warrior tank anyway?  :)<br />
<br />
I used a similar situation to powerlevel my mage with my warrior.  Pull a mob with the warrior, send in the fire pet, but leave the warrior standing next to the pet so he takes all the hits and the pet can beat on the mobs back.  The pet holds aggro, the warrior takes all the hits, and the pet + mage + DS on the warrior kill the mob without taking any damage.  Mobs were green to the warrior so he didn't take much damage.  Worked pretty well.  Once you figure out when to do it without KSing the warrior can attack at the end of the fight to speed things up even more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">08-20-2003, 11:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You should have a warrior tank even with a CoD pet because that way the pet gets to attack from behind, and the pet doing ~15% more damage (no special defenses) is quite significant.  <br />
<br />
Also the pets don't actually mitigate that well.  Although it's easy to get a max CH on them, it is not clear to me that you actually get more mileage out of healing them compare to a well-equipped warrior.</div></div><hr />

I rather save my taunt and press it whenver someone casted a high agro spell on the mob (having other spells = grp) helps alot. <br />
<br />
Works much better for me than mashing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">08-21-2003, 10:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the &quot;time to mash taunt&quot; thing is referring to when it's just you and the pet.  The pet is gaining aggro faster than you are, and you can kinda piggyback his aggro without worrying about losing it to a caster or another person (like a monk/rogue/sk/etc).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gimmel</div><div class="date">08-21-2003, 01:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, not just when it is only you and the pet. The pet is going to out aggro just about EVERYONE, so tauting everytime it refreshs is going to only add to your hate every time. In fact, it is MORE valuable if you have other melees, since casters are really only in danger of getting aggro when charm breaks, but melees will get aggro anytime they outaggro the tank. Here, I'll illustrate<br />
<br />
Warrior: 500 hate<br />
Rogue: 400 hate<br />
Wizard: 400 hate<br />
Pet: 1000 hate<br />
<br />
Warrior has aggro, then rogue BSes<br />
Warrior: 600 hate<br />
Rogue: 700 hate<br />
Wizard: 400 hate<br />
Pet: 1500 hate<br />
<br />
Rogue gets aggro, warrior taunts, wizard nukes<br />
Warrior: 1501 hate<br />
Rogue: 800 hate<br />
Wizard: 800 hate<br />
Pet: 1600 hate<br />
<br />
Wizard goes on a nuking spree<br />
Warrior: 1700 hate<br />
Rogue: 1200 hate<br />
Wizard: 1800 hate<br />
Pet: 2500 hate<br />
Now at this point you see that technically, the wizard has the most hate of any PC, but the warrior keeps aggro because the pet has the most hate, but the mob will always attack a PC before a pet. Mashing taunt will help insure that the mob never turns on the rogue, and that if charm breaks, the mob will stay on the tank.</div></div><hr />

Trust me, I have healed warriors and CoD pets.  My 56 cleric with no FT and *really* bad gear can easily keep a CoD pet alive in tactics and have mana left over to nuke.  That cleric healing a warrior tanking in Tactics = OOM every other fight.  A warrior or any melee other than a ranger is deadweight in a group with a CoD pet, even post-nerf.  When I group my warrior with a CoD chanter in tactics I sit him in the corner facing the wall and play my cleric out of group to (almost) justify the experience I am leeching.<br />
<br />
Oh, and I agree 100% with Gimmel's posts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frodlin7th</div><div class="date">08-21-2003, 02:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gimmel, you're right, it's along the same line as tanking on raid level mobs.   One class has built up more hate than the others, and more even than the warrior, yet the mob isn't attacking them.   When opportunity strikes, they WILL do so though, if that pet croaks or worse, breaks charm not only will the enchanter take the beating from his formerly charmed mob but also from the one you're fighting.    Taunt mashing while pets are there is a &quot;cheap&quot; way of actually gaining points of hatred.</div></div><hr />
