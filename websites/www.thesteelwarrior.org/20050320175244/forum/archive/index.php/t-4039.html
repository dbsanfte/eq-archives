I see a lot of people with what are clearly specialized messages in that location.  How can I change that for myself?<br />
<br />
I looked in the user control panel but didn't see an option for that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Or you could click your heals together three .... o wait you dont wear heals, well try starring in the mirror and saying Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, BeetleJuice....  /shakes her head and stomps her feet<br />
<br />
Gah, I cant remeber the way to get the message to change.  <br />
<br />
/snaps her fingers<br />

Wait , I remeber, it has something to do with hockey and catching someone on a good day.<br />

I'm pretty sure you need to post more.<br />
<br />
I found the widget in my user profile editor one night (Edit Profile &gt; User Title -- Click here for the Custom User Title Editor!) when I dinged 60.  <br />
<br />
I had spotted a reply  to someone else who had also hit Warlord, telling them to &quot;update their title already&quot; (in hindsight, it mighta been &quot;.sig&quot; :p).  Went looking for the gizmo, and found it.  I goofed with it a couple times, nothing to freaky, but it reverted to what it is now.  And so did a few searches, and tho I didn't find anything that spelled out all the levels of &quot;title privelege&quot;, but I'm pretty sure you need to hit a certain post level (100 I'm guessing) to play with that at all, and some higher number to pick your own.  But I dunno.  And obviously it's moderated, which means that in my ignorance, I've wasted someone's time - twice :o.<br />
<br />
Hell, Warriors ARE superior - with arguably inferior tools, and despite the erosion of the class' unique characteristics, we get the job done dammit.  If I ever get the privilege, I'm gonna put &quot;STILL knows that Warriors are superior!&quot; or something like that :D.<br />
<br />
To quote/misquote a current movie ad - &quot;We may give our lives - but we will give them HELL before we do!&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Heh ... answers popped while I was typing.  I infer from this that maybe I shouldn't be seeing the Title editor link in my profile, in which case my profile is busted mebbe.</div></div><hr />

&quot;knows that Warriors should be superior&quot;</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raaj</div><div class="date">11-05-2003, 09:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We transferred a ton of them over, if people asked for them back when the board change occured.<br />
<br />
And haass - some people had them on the other board, those were transferred. Others helped alot with moving some of the other posts, or other things and asked for a title for it, and we weren't being picky. Then, we got like 1000 pm's a day asking for them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">11-05-2003, 09:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">when i reach 1000 posts ld like,cranky bastard please :D</div></div><hr />

However, if he'd like to lead raids on Bath and Body Works (tm) stores, I want to see that :D</div></div><hr />

Then, we got like 1000 pm's a day asking for them. <br />
<br />
Well that's fine, I've got no problem with what other people do with their custom titles, I was just questioning why there are a few people without the post counts to make that statement valid.<br />
<br />
In the end, I don't give a flying fuck about my title, or anyone elses.   If I could change it myself, I would, but it's not worth enough to waste someone else's time over it.  <br />
<br />
It'd be cool if that field in your control panel worked when you had 500+ posts tho.  There's your next task sHORTY, snap to it :)</div></div><hr />
