I have found it to be really flexible, if I put a damage augment on it, it makes an awsome DPS weapon, but with anger2 on it, it holds aggro better than a red epic...<br />
<br />
let me know your opions, I think it is about 300 because of the stun.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">so now we're assuming that a pure stun is 350 hate?<br />

i agree with the ratings for the most part, but i'd guess that the pure stun component is a good bit higher and that the numbers for GBoS are therefore a wee bit low?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">the proc of the GBoS is alike to the one from CHoS. if stun is 400 hate we get a 519 hate proc, if it is 450 we get too close to anger 3 with a wooping 569 hate, actually even 519 is said too much for the CHoS.<br />
on the other hand don't forget theese mumbers are given at 0%  haste. we get, depending on haste, diferent result for the avg hate/min :<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Gerick, I'd seriously recommend at LEAST swapping your procs around. You're &quot;breaking&quot; a nice non-knockback weapon (CHSD) by adding a kb proc to it, and not adding much to a GBoS. Personally, I'd ignore the A2 and buy A3 for where you want pure aggro, given that you will be able to remove it when you upgrade now, or buy both (100dd and 125dd) yak procs if you're into dps and knockback.</div></div><hr />

Not a big deal in itself, but with dual wield ykesha augs and weapon affinity... it just might pose a problem, especially when coupled with pet push, spell knockbacks, etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can assure you that those 1 foot knockbacks make for a sizeable push if there isn't anything pushing back.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think the point he was trying to make was if you have two weapons, one with a kb and one without, it would make sense to put the kb proc on the weapon that already has a kb, and the pure hate aug on the pure hate weapon.  That way in certain situations you could swap the two when it helps.<br />
<br />
I hate Kb, but since everyone in EQ has droga weapons, the mobs will get moved around.  Not much I can do about it.<br />
<br />
I do find it interesting that people love the GBoS, and yet many don't like the chos.  Many claim dps means nothing and it's all about the proc, those two weapons have the same proc.  Therefore wouldn't the chos be almost as good?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Yep.Same kinda thread above hehe.The GBOS has a small advantage mainhanded.It just seems more leet hehe.Same class of aggro weapons imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Semp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Forgive me for my ignorance on the matter, but when you guys are referring to Droga weapons having knockback I can only assume you mean Bloodsworn and Copper Hammer.   I had checked Lucy, but there was no mention of a knockback in these spells, is it simply innate to all stuns?  The same goes for Ykesha procs.  Do these also push the mob if the stun component is resisted/immune?   I currently have a Bloodsworn/Onyx Gavel combo to interrupt spell casters (both have a stun up to 65), would adding ykesha procs to both of these (stun only works to 55) help with caster interrupts?  I find myself in pickup groups with more morons than I'd care to that simply have no clue as to how to stop mobs from gating, especially in LDoN, so I generally swap in this combo when I know we have a gating mob in camp, which doesn't bother me any, and its sole purpose is to interupt casts.  So if adding the ykesha procs will help with interrupts I think I'll go grind out a few and buy the cheap ones :)  Thanks in advance for any help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Knockback is listed on lucy as &quot;push back&quot;. Most but not all stun procs seem to have it. Strike of Ykesha, Force of Ykesha (yak procs) Force Shock (GBoS/CHoS) and Planar Stun (SotB) all have a push back of 1. <br />
<br />
An example of a stun proc without a knockback appears to be Anger (from a DBoTWL). http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3624<br />
<br />
I'm guessing the kb only happens when the stun isn't resisted but I haven't really tried to verify that.</div></div><hr />

I returned my guildbank's BoC when I got my GBoS. Only ended up swapping it out ( DW altogether ) when I got my Blade of War. It's that good and a very solid weapon to have in your arsenal; plus at that level of the game it ain't very hard to get at all.<br />
<br />
**BTW on the whole knockback deal; whenever it proc's all I did was take a step or two backwards. problem resolved itself :D **</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I think some people worry WAY too much about knockback.  If you do, I'm sorry,  but get over it.  It's not that big of a deal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Yep. Exactly. Thank you. Nothing wrong with a little knockback, but you may as well keep it all on the same weapon so you can get rid of it if you need to. It sounds like he's already got A2 on his GBoS so the point is moot though. Oh well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">It's not an exagerattion <br />
<br />
Sigh...look at my magelo.  I use both a GBoS and a GSo4W with a yak proc continuously.  The only KB I ever worry about is:<br />
<br />
1. If multiple people are using these weapons from the same direction on a raid (AoW or static wall pin positioning negates this)<br />
<br />
2. The ^&amp;*&amp; BST pets KB.  In exp groups this drives me batty  :) <br />
<br />
3. I'm using stonewall...but strafing pretty easily keeps up with this KB drift.<br />
<br />
My point was to use a term like &quot;ruin&quot; is an exaggeration and may cause less informed new warriors to make bad equipment decisons based on this over blown fear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">OK, so &quot;ruin&quot; is a strong word, but nonetheless given the choice, keeping your non-kb weapons &quot;clean&quot; seems like a good policy to me. <br />
<br />
In xp group's i'm usually glad to have the extra positioning power kb gives me, but every now and then I get a whiny ranger or rogue in my group, or some genius open-raid leader decides to &quot;outlaw&quot; kb weapons because they've got 15 people with chos' all charging the same side of the mob. Thats when having a &quot;clean&quot; weapon instead of two &quot;dirty&quot; ones could be handy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Yeah open raids do have ALOT of morons running them (I had one who insisted that the raid had to stay on the tiles for MM because if you didnt you would set off a piece of code that would autoagro his guards; another in which they banned pets even if you had pet hold etc all)....I see your point regarding KB in this context (although a decent raid leader would just compensate with positioning).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Yeah, although in the defense of open raid leaders, their stupidity is vastly eclipsed by the average raider. Sometimes those stupid rules (no kb weapons, no pets, don't hail the pp, everyone stay behind me, don't invite yet, stfu in /rs) are the only way to get consistent behavior from people because the raiders are too dumb to realize that maybe that other guy with his pet out HAS pet hold.<br />
<br />
Keep a clean weapon, and even as the MA on the raid you can set a good example.<br />
<br />
Anyway, GBoS is a nice weapon. I'm working on getting one as we speak :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Keep a clean weapon, and even as the MA on the raid you can set a good example <br />
<br />
Thats a kinda an odd statement.  You'd bag your best agro weapon (assuming GBoS) to &quot;be a good example&quot; as a MA?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>unclebong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Mobs just die faster when they're not getting shoved all over the place, or chasing after stupid debuffers.  20+ melee beating on a mob generates some amazing push on its own.  One GBoS or CHoS proc is enough to send the mob flying when you got a ton of melee  push already.  Add in that a) you dont get to control when proc's happens and b) they tend to happen to many folks at once, it can turn into a clusterfuck before you know it.  Used to be walling nerfed a lot of dps which is a problem but they fixed that so there goes that argument.  I've always felt the margninal increase in my own personal dps wasnt worth nerfing everyone elses dps by shoving it oor, out of rogue backstab position, or by walling it (when that was an issue).  Also, stun = aggro proc.  Unless I'm MT, I've no business aggroing the mob.</div></div><hr />

Umm no, one proc from Force Struck doesn't change its push because 20 others are on it, its still one foot, which is minute.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Bonequest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">What moves the mob is when 20 monks and rangers all have CHoS in main hand and each one is getting procs 2 times a minute.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">I think the GBOS/CHSD combo would serve you well a long time especially auged.If you competed for aggro consistently with a BOC/CHSD war all other things being equal you would lose over time in my experience.The BOC is significanlty better.I used a CHSD mainhand competing against a GBOS war for a long time and found them to be very close.I would give the edge to the GBOS.Of course these  are all good tanking weapons and close enuff that the rng and subtler tanking details would decide fast fights.<br />
<br />
But yeh,I think the GBOS is a great all around weapon at that point.<br />
<br />
I never had a problem with my force shock weapons and push,although, I did not Yak aug them.I've seen lots of problems with pet push on raids.They just don't seem to be able to exert any push retraint hehe.</div></div><hr />

Granted; some fights on low FR mobs it' great; but everything else in between it's delegated to a ratio-oriented offhander at best.<br />
<br />
GBoS/CHSD will do the job well; especially augmented and will hold you until you get a beefy 2Her for Elemental level stuff and the appropriate AA's. I'd believe you won't go wrong with that DW setup.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Umm no, one proc from Force Struck doesn't change its push because 20 others are on it, its still one foot, which is minute.<br />
20 folks pushing + all the 1 foot kb's added on top of it and oh yea, you will see it.  yea, the 1 foot kb by itself isnt much by itself.  then again any 1 toons contribution is minute when compared to what a raid can do.  add it all together and it can get real nasty.  of course, it is possible for 1 toon to wipe an entire raid ;p<br />
<br />
how in the hell do you get 20 guys all on the same side of a mob if the raid leader knows how to raid, what kind of raids are you on anyway?<br />
Ones full of beastlords with hairballs in their ears not listening or paying attention shoving the mob in one direction, which places all the rangers, monks, and warriors with their nifty pushbacks on the same side of the mob.  so one lucky hit on the RNG at that point with all those pushback's on one side (compliments of the 1 dumbass not paying attention, doesnt have to be a bst ;p) and your in for some interseting times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Zynth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">the 1ft KB procs arent really a big problem, even if there were 20 people using them. the probability of just 10 people proccing in the same 2 seconds it takes for the server to update the mobs location before the mob jolts up 5ft is almost a statistic impossibility. lag however, can make it seem like everyone at the raid just landed a KB effect all at once. <br />
<br />
the real problem is the long duration stun spells. when a mob is stunned for a longer time frame, a message is sent to the server telling it that the mob should be stationary. but there are those 20-30 people beating away on the mob generating melee push. lag again, making it seem much worse. so the server knowing that the mob should be stationary caculates all the push and KB at once for part, if not the entire duration of the stun. thats why when a mob is stunned you're still hitting it for a second or 2 after it's jolted out of your range.<br />
<br />
with GBoS CHoS and the like, the mobs (up to 55) arent even getting stunned. with the 65 stun procs the mobs arent even stunned for a full second, so the server only has to caculate the KB applied to the mob in the 0.0 second time frame when the mob was actually stunned before the mob is no longer regestering as stationary. which makes the KB from those procs go a lot smoother.</div></div><hr />

Proc's and Crit's tend to go off for many people at once.  To my eyes its a varible controlled by the zone.  I dont think its lag cause it happens too often, even on low lag days.</div></div><hr />

I don't know where you are getting your hate data, but I don't agree with your assumption that the proc generates hate for the stun and the damage separately.<br />
<br />
It is clear from the fact that weapons generate cosntant hate, regardless of the damage they do, or even whether or not they hit, that they have optimized hate calculations server side, probably to make the code run faster.  It makes more sense that the proc generates a constant hate value, whatever that turns out to be.  The information for it isn't in the spell data that everybody parses, or we'd have known values for these things already.</div></div><hr />

It makes more sense that the proc generates a constant hate value, whatever that turns out to be.  The information for it isn't in the spell data that everybody parses, or we'd have known values for these things already.<br />
<br />
we are currently planning to update data on swing's hate because we didn't understand all the factor.<br />
<br />
BUT, it has been prooven that :<br />
1. a spell gives the same amount of hate whether it is resisted or not.<br />
2. it has been parsed the all the DD spells have a hate value of 2/3 of their listed domage (ie it isn't the domage you make after focus/partial resist/crits...) thus it can be calculated from the spell data.<br />
3. it has benn parsed that stun hate is betwwen 350 and 450.<br />
4. it is obvious that when a spell is a sum of different basic spells, that its global aggro value is the sum of its composantes.<br />
<br />
=&gt; thus the determination of the proc's hate is correct (I used the safer way in using the lowest aggro value of the stun). Or do you think that Force Shock can either be stun or a DD depending on luck ...<br />
<br />
5. it has been parsed that the hate generated from a weapon is not growing overtime 'just like that'. you have to actually swing your wapon to generate hate.<br />
6. it has been parsed that you gain the same amount of hate wether or not you miis the mob.<br />
7. it has been parsed that this constant hate value linked to the weapon is dependant on its unhasted delay , but on its domage too.<br />
~&gt;from the point 5, and even if the aggro tests have been run with lvl 65 only, we infer it depend on the domage bonus and on the domage (both physical and magical) of the weapon.<br />
 * different rule of aggro calculation has been established, all with flaws.<br />
<br />
8. the biggest flaw (that I'd forgotten) of the one I used for this result is that the parses has been run by a Monk !  and that it has been prooven by SK that weapon's hate has a Class mod. thus my hate values are underestimated.<br />
<br />
So yes, my aggro values are wrong. But you don't even understand what has been given in the table you quote, neither all the background hiden within.<br />
<br />
You just said, &quot;it's wrong&quot; and &quot;hate value is fixed serverwide otherwise it would be laggy&quot; and you didn't even understand that it was that fixed hate values that I was given. yes these value aren't in the spell data, neither on weapon data, but they are what we have parsed, so yes they are getting known. the accuracy isn't fully present, but we are getting closer.<br />
<br />
So insteed of thowing to the trash what you don't understand, try to ask what they are and what they come from and what is their accuraccy.<br />
