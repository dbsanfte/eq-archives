<br />
Can a mod please get rid of that before someone gets a sickening eye full, and possibly lose a job or something if caught surfing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dovan</div><div class="date">10-06-2003, 03:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">HOLY SHIT.... I made the mistake of looking back on this.  I doubt he did this on purpose... but please step up killing his sig for the time being.<br />
<br />
I also took the time to look at url it's linked out too.... yeah, I'm saying someone set him up the bomb.<br />
<br />
Also just thought bout this for a sec.... he sig was a down about 10 minutes before I saw this post, and then his sig came back up so mysteriously after I don't see him on user list?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">10-06-2003, 04:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Working on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">10-06-2003, 04:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I removed the sigs on his last 75 posts, all I had time for on my lunch hour.  Hopefully before long Raaj or Shorty can log on and edit his sig.  In the mean time, be careful opening older threads if you're at work.<br />
<br />
He is banned also.  The fact that it happened right after I mentioned that his old sig was too big leads me to believe that it was no accident.  If it was somebody messing with him, well he can thank them for getting him banned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thalzaar</div><div class="date">10-06-2003, 04:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Brutul. <br />
<br />
It's a shame that this level of immaturity has to be taken on a wonderful board such as this and i hope that no one got in trouble by viewing this crap or is scarred for life, lol.<br />
<br />
hopefully Raaj can break his sig for good and eliminate this altogether. Thanks for taking your offtime to clean up a little of this mess Brutul. I'm sure everyone appreciates it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It happened on the Drinal boards to someone that everyone thinks is funny. Had to be one of the most hilarious moments ever.<br />
<br />
The best part was he was trying to make fun of someone on the boards with typical homosexual-stupid talk and when he posted his sig it was a giant Phallus LOLOLOLOLOL...<br />
<br />
Don't think I have ever seen anyone blush over the internet before, but this was pretty close.<br />

Drop me a PM if you really really need to see it. I would hardly reccoment it though /em goes to barf.<br />
<br />

It really was disgusting, and even though some are curious, all of you would wish we didn't describe it afterwards.  /stabs daggers through his eyes</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thaak2</div><div class="date">10-07-2003, 12:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just wanted to add that the image itself was changed, not the URL.<br />
<br />
My host apparently got mad at the bandwidth I was causing and edited the pic... with something grotesque.<br />
<br />
I'm sure an admin can verify that I hadn't edited anything in my sig.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry for what happened, just wanted to clear some things up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jakle Attakle</div><div class="date">10-07-2003, 01:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with him, whoever the bandwidth hosting site is, they did something similar over on the Triton Boards of a guy who was hosting Brittany Spears pics.<br />
<br />
You can even tell it is the same, because they use that weird one picture a little lower than the one to its left, etc...</div></div><hr />

remember the mummy returns? think of his wife...... nude..   You probably mean the first one, &quot;The Mummy&quot;...in the second one his wife is reincarnated as some young woman that probably looks mighty good nude. :D<br />

The first one was where she was still mummified.</div></div><hr />
