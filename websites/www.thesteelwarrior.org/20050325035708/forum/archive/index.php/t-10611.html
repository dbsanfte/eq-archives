<br />
Don't want to ask for any spoliers or strats etc, but...<br />
<br />
What is a realistic amount of healing that you suggest for this?<br />
<br />
We have been attempting this with about 9 clerics and 3 druids on a routine basis. <br />
<br />
So, am I barking up the wrong tree when I think that we probably just need some more healing?</div></div><hr />

10 clerics min we've done it with, tho I'm sure its possible with less.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This was my reaction too, when someone can ask seriously if 9 clerics in a 54 person raid are 'enough', without being sarcastic.<br />
<br />
I am not poking fun at Furo, I just find the state of the game kind of sad.<br />
<br />
I do remember a post on the bard boards where a bard in AO mentioned that in one of their Tacvi runs pre-OoW they had 17 clerics in a 52 person raid <br />
 :eek:</div></div><hr />

Just wasn't sure at all. Had been hearing that some who beat this were having to substitute some classes out to make room for healing, so good to know you don't need overkill after all.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">02-14-2005, 12:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A harsh reality that shouldn't be.  Seven clerics is a pretty nice amount of healing power.  If Sony wants to design content to specifically stress keeping a tank alive, then it should be within the walls and boundries that the extra healing of druids and shamans can help lend out.  Why do I say this?  Because let's sit and think here for a moment.  How many guilds out there say &quot;Cleric Class: Closed&quot; on their recruiting section of their website?  Ya, you fucking don't, because for the vast majority of EQ raiding guilds out there, clerics are either bottom of the barrel pickings or second boxes of a main from another class.  You occasionally get a prodigy cleric out of this method, but I'd be willing to bet that at least half your cleric core isn't comprised of 100%, top of the line beef.  This isn't meant to be an insult to those who play clerics, but guilds pick up any and all clerics they can get their hands on, because if they don't, they don't fuckin' raid!.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">02-14-2005, 04:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I always thought the King/Queen events were a good challenge at spreading out your healing resources, although the prince/princesses aren't exactly super dps hitters.  I mean, it *could* be a lot harder for progression purposes and not necessarily loot/ancient farming, but the King/Queen events are incredibly enjoyable for me, especially since everyone gets to do something and feel important.  We use two clerics for each prince/princess tank (we tank and kill three at a time then retreat and deal with the adds), and the druids/shamans heal the mezzers/debuffers/etc.  This, imho, is quite balanced.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Coroq</div><div class="date">02-14-2005, 05:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">From what I've seen of the event, 9 clerics + 3 druids looks to be enough but close to the minimum; much less and the ocassional unlucky AE stun could easily cause a wipe - would require you to get lucky, and/or that most of your healers have great gear and AA skills.<br />
<br />
The tormenters can be pulled to zone in and killed 1 at a time? If that's true that's funny. :)<br />
<br />
But ya I agree that the number of healers, especially clerics, required in a raid of 54 max is silly. And from what I've heard most people agree.  Why require that about 1 in 6 people be of 1 class in order to advance past an encounter, when there are way more than 6 classes in EQ? Almost sounds like maybe splitting the 3 to zone in 1 at a time is the intended way to beat this...?</div></div><hr />

Tanks, clerics, druids, shamans, ramp tanks, curers, and prime dps (wiz/rog), which basically left 13 slots for the rangers, monks, beasts, necro's, mages, sk's,  enc's,  and bards to fight over (6 slots went to bards/encs automatically tho).  End up having to sit the same people every fight :[  poor sk's.</div></div><hr />

Are the dps slots really that important? Never seemed to be an issue for us, enough healing = win.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Rogues do by far the best damage on very short (1 minute), medium (4+ minutes) and long fights, wizards do nearly as well on the short (3 minutes) time frame, but fall off horribly after that.<br />
<br />
The point is, rangers, monks, magicians, berserkers, are all remarkably close DPS wise assuming similar gear and a raid won't really notice that big a difference.<br />
<br />
Healing is a different beast entirely, clerics are the only acceptable choice and are required in absurd numbers.<br />
<br />
While requiring a lot of clerics is horrible for the players, it is however a good 'design' choice, as making the number of clerics a limiting factor for progression is a great way to slow down the rate at which content gets consumed.</div></div><hr />

YEEEEEEEEESS. Since ur dps will be divided in this event (healing too). Like Mearis said for long fight such as this, Monk(epic 2ed) &gt; Zerker(epic 2ed) &gt; Ranger(epic 2ed) &gt; Rogue for us too. <br />
Key to winning this event is group setup(assuming you have enough healing and dps).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mearis</div><div class="date">02-15-2005, 12:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm Velle, you got your &gt; signs messed up I think :)  I said that on the very long term, Berserkers, Monks, Rangers, Mages are all somewhat acceptable and Rogues are still way ahead of everyone.<br />
<br />
On the short term, Rogues and Wizards are ahead of everyone, the difference is while rogue damage falls off with time, it stays up on top regardless of length of fight.<br />
<br />
Your monks outdamage rogues on the very long term?</div></div><hr />

Admittingly though, our tanks probably aren't as strong as they should be at this level, and we need a 7 cleric rotation going fulltime in order to keep the tank alive past defensive.  Then add the 3-4 needed to help keep the groups alive, mixed in with the druids and shamans we already have.  I'm confident we would have won last time, but we had a problem keeping our tanks up in some badly timed AEs, hehehe.  <br />
<br />
Btw Furo, looks like you just won a BBoB recently.  Grats!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Karog</div><div class="date">03-03-2005, 09:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">DPS is much better balanced than healing, rogue asides.<br />
<br />
Rogues do by far the best damage on very short (1 minute), medium (4+ minutes) and long fights, wizards do nearly as well on the short (3 minutes) time frame, but fall off horribly after that.<br />
<br />
While i do agree with you on the dmg of the Rogues being King &quot;overtime&quot;. I must say that wizard dmg &quot;overtime&quot; can match that of the rogues depending on how many you have on the raid. Usually with 4 - 5 wizards on a raid with equal gear will extend the dps of that group. I guess its the same thinking that goes into a CH chain. (Where as the healing power of the group extends the healing ability of the individual) The same can be said about wizards, the dmg of the group can extend the dmg abilitys of the individual. <br />
<br />
I always love it when your pounding on a mob and it seems to evaporate. You know the DPS is kicking in then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">03-03-2005, 09:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">if 1 rogue is 500dps with a steady rate upon a 5min time frame, and that a wizard is 250dps with a highly spiky rate (min~50 max ~1500) upon a 5min time frame.<br />
then, ok, 6 wizards can output 1500 dps with a steady rate upon 5min time frame, but 6 rogues would output 3000dps with a steady rate upon a 5min time frame.<br />
So your statement saying that wizards get better when numerous, while correct, doesn't mean that they aren't broken when compared to rogues.<br />
what it would have been wize to apply your statement about is necromencers. one Necro can output a very nice dps upon long time frame with all their DOTs, moreover their manatap let them sustain their dps at nauseum (like rogues). But due to the mobs' debuff-slot limit, it exist a dps limit that DOTs (at a given level, focus, AA) can't break through. thus only a given number of necro can cohabit before reaching this limit, and I bet that even with the increased debuff-slot number a full group of necro won't output the dps of six time the dps a single necro does.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mearis</div><div class="date">03-03-2005, 09:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm, the way I read his post is that by adding more and more DPS classes, a mob dies faster, thus wizards do not have time to go OOM.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sorguran</div><div class="date">03-03-2005, 06:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">that's flawed logic.<br />
<br />
By adding more DPS period something dies faster.<br />
<br />
By adding 500 steady dps compared to ~50 to ~1500 (qouting earlier post here) highly spiky DPS - things will die faster.<br />

Constant medium &gt; occasional and short-lived high.</div></div><hr />

Usually, especially in MPG and Anguish, your raid mobs tend to have nice round HP totals around 3 - 4 million HP,  which generally speaking, tend to run somewhere in the 10-15 minute lengths (hanvar = afk).  A good HP comparison would be, say, an m`sha has about 1 million HP.  Tack on some mana drain ae's, and usually the casters are in &quot;burn your mana out before it runs out&quot; mode.<br />
<br />
Somewhere  in mid-GoD, casters really lost the oomph on DPS, they still produce, but once the mana pool is dry, as it often ends up being, it's all about the melee.  I suppose the coinciding of large HP mobs in Tacvi, and high damage pokers for rogues, was the real DPS turning point.  Especially as more nice weapons began to pour in as OoW opened up.</div></div><hr />

yup yup. Yodda and Aono, great post.<br />
<br />
While i'm not saying nor am i comparing Wizard and Rogue DPS, theres no way, a Rogue is King of DPS. Period... I wish we had 6 that raided every night. While yes you can add 6 more rogues to take those wizy spots you still have to gate home from a raid :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">03-04-2005, 02:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think it's a combination of two things - Resists and Aggro.<br />
<br />
Most of our wizards have their ancient core fire nuke.  Seeing 11.5k+ crit nukes is a riot, and they're also paired up with a bard who has his ancient song that amps spell damage by a further 30%.  The problem is, is that even with that kind of specialization, they still don't outdamage our rogues who use Uqua agued Crystal Daggers.  Wizards have to wait about ~30 seconds before the mob is completely debuffed in order to start nuking at peak strength.  Rogues?  They can hop right onto the backs of the mobs within the first 5 seconds and, as long as they're evading regularly, they'll never have to worry about pulling aggro in the same way a wizard does.  I find that damage per aggro, wizards are ridiculously more aggro limited than they really should be.  Thirty seconds in a 3-4 minute fight is a pretty good chunk of change.<br />
<br />
Where's the justification in this?  It's not that wizards don't do respectable damage, because they do, but why are they being outclassed on the burst front and totally blown out of the water on long fights?  I'd dare call my wizards (one of which is my guildleader) a slacker, but I consistantly see them beaten every single time.  Wizards need help and SoE is turning a deaf ear to listen to them.</div></div><hr />
