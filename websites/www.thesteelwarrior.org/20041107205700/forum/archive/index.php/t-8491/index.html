<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gobsmash Emgood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Seems like a lot of the mobs used to parse on are disappearing. With weapon combos being as hard as they are to evaluate for DPS agro PPM etc. It would be nice to have somewhere we can check those things.<br />
<br />
Enter Plane of War back when PoP was being designed there was intended to be a zone before Plane of Tactics called the Plane of War, it would have been a second tier zone that would have given access to PoTactics. There is a stone to click for it at 5 stones, it is the left most stone, click able but goes nowhere.<br />
<br />
I think that the PoW should be made as a zone that will let you parse combat damage and agro versus 3 level ranges of mobs and to provide some interest make a few small instanced zones that will let you dual a NPC for tribute master points by fighting for your city. Allow check boxes for mob level and general difficulty and another option that would allow you to make any death non-rezable for a few times the points. The mobs can be preexisting mobs with no loot or loot only if you kill a number of mobs. As well it would be interesting if you could challenge other people or groups to a fight again with the option of permanent exp loss it becomes worth while and has some risk.<br />
<br />
About to go camping more on this later if there is some interst.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Doubt they would put work into making things that we can parse on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I doubt it too.  I'd rather suggest that they finish Plane of War and release it as the next &quot;free&quot; zone.  Make it an EP-difficulty zone, but oriented for XP groupage instead of raiding.  Put a single-group quest in Drunder to enable access to it.<br />
<br />
The existing zone file for Plane of War has all sorts of interesting aspects:<br />
<br />
open areas divided into &quot;field 1&quot; and &quot;field 2&quot; by a wall;<br />
sealed underground tunnels where a &quot;trial&quot; type event could be staged;<br />
large separate fortresses for the armies of Tallon and Vallon;<br />
a closed area at the far end where a raid encounter could be held without interfering with the rest of the zone.<br />
<br />
To be honest, I can't see anything in the zone geometry itself that explains why the zone was scrapped.  The zone geometry itself looks like a &quot;plane of fire for the non-raider&quot;, which is exactly what was missing from PoP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Arathena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The plane of War, AFAIK, was to be directed by a very large and complex script, not entirely dissimilar to the Hollowshade Moor war. The zone was scrapped in the latter portions of PoP testing as they could not make the scripts function properly, and the Vallon/Tallon wings were added to Tactics, which was originally concieved to be much like HOH: It would provide a backdrop for the RZ fight much more than anything else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I can see that.  The PoWar zone layout screams &quot;Tallon army vs. Vallon army&quot;, the map rooms in each fortress scream &quot;TZ and VZ spawn points&quot;, and the closed area at the north end screams &quot;Fake RZ fight spot&quot;.<br />
<br />
Armies of mobs fighting each other would indeed be easily exploitable.  So why not just turn it into an outdoor XP zone?  Seems odd to throw out zone geometry/artwork that's already finished and burned onto the PoP CD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Arathena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Because the entirety of the zone design was built to support the script: Rebuilding PoWar would have been on an even higher level of effort than the Droga/Nurga revamps, as old pathing and AI would need to be scrapped and rebuilt along with mob population, reitemization, so on and so forth. It's likely that the script was abandoned merely days before the shipping of PoP, with Vallon and Tallon replacing other minis in Drunder, and the MB flag simply being reassociated. After shipment, of course, no one ever found any round tuits, what with the snarls that were early PoP flags.</div></div><hr />

Tallon as Sentinal<br />

Oh wait, wrong game :p</div></div><hr />

Cool idea.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sounds alot like a pvp server there are 3 available try one sometime.  You do not lose xp, but do lose pvp points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">wish they wouldve had tallon vallon and XP in plane fo war with something that flagged you for drunder in plane of war so you could fight RZ in a whole other zone. i dont know about other servers but on bertoxx theres usually about 20 people in tactics in addition to your raid when youre doing RZ because everyone seems to want to watch the fight, mess up the fight, or beg for an RZ flag.</div></div><hr />

scourge and sentinal ^^</div></div><hr />

<br />
Obviously they got busted for trying to do something for the &quot;non-raider&quot; and got executed on the spot. Sony does not put up with helping people who don't raid in any way shape or form!  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>ketel kaotic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">should make it a non exp zone, and the mobs you kill provide tribute.  Have it spam mobs faster and faster till ya wipe... now that would be fun :)<br />
<br />
The tribute would be great as a guild tribute ... <br />
<br />
Take your guild in for a slaugher when you have 100's of mobs swarming you some having 1000 hp's and some with 10,000 or 32,000.  sorta like a LOTR fight scene when ya just hack away for an hour hahaha.... make each group have their own assist person, and let the blood fly!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kaltek_Eci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Could at least empty PoWar and make it another arena for now or something that is easy to get to till they get around to revamping it (if ever).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why take your guild ? Take 2 warrior friends with you and shaker the zone :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gobsmash Emgood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I think my first idea still has merit, they are in to providing what players want and this is something that will be a time sink but not a dirty 4 letter word one but one that will get players going there regurlary to play and provide a zone to PvP similer to how the baz has provided players a way to sell things.</div></div><hr />
