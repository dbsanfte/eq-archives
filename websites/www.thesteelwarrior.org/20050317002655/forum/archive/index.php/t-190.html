I am guildless right now, and play odd hours of the day. I have decent equipment, and can hold my own in a fight against blues. I usually have pickup groups, because all my friends grew up when I took a leave of absence. So I need to know where to go in order to make some semblance of money. Platinum in any form is good. Thanks for the help in advance :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
However, if you have a shammy friend, or can pick one up on the way ... go to Nadox and kill Blackhands.  Those guys drop up to 10pp+ in coin, and keeping them cleared spawns named pretty often, some with decent sellables.</div></div><hr />

I usually duo or trio there with a few Druid friends and after 2 or so hours we'll all have 200+pp after selling off the vt (bring some empty bags)</div></div><hr />

Head to Sanctus Seru and have the cleric bind in dawnshroud or marus seru.<br />
<br />
Kill the mobs at the zone in, they drop up to 20pp each as well as fine steel weapons and newbie armor. Have the cleric faithstone and sell the fine steel, and convert the copper, silver, and gold to plat for ya.<br />

Rinse and repeat till you can't move from platinum encumberance.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rotep</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 06:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">you can get 10k plat for 30$ from a site called www.ige.com Kind of surprized it hasn't been posted as I assume the uber guilds have been selling plat like this for a while now.I don't bother with it ,though.I'd rather be crappy and earn it,but that's just my opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 07:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kind of surprized it hasn't been posted as I assume the uber guilds have been selling plat like this for a while now <br />
<br />
It hasn't been posted because it is against SOE's rules to buy or sell anything in EQ using real life cash.  I doubt uber guilds do it often, as they run the risk of being banned for doing so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iskandar</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 10:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Besides the obvious legal ramifications, I strongly recommend ya don't go the way of Ebay. Ultimately it's your decision but I guarantee ya the game will become far more trivial and less fun in the long run if ya turn into Richie Rich in EQ overnight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dintorr</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 03:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Besides the obvious legal ramifications<br />
<br />
Except that there aren't any legal ramifications ...<br />
<br />
All you're doing is violating the EULA, not the law.<br />
<br />
Besides, even if you had a million plat in the bank the game would be far from &quot;trivial&quot;.  The game is way too challenging to be significantly affected by a single player buying plat online and twinking their character.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, if each player in the entire Guild bought a million plat to twink their characters then much of the content would become easier for that particular Guild.<br />
<br />
Ultimately, it's up to each individual player to determine for themselves why they play the game ... some play for the challenge, some for the comaradarie, others to see and do new things, etc.<br />
<br />
Determine for yourself why you play.  If the game would be more fun for you if you had 10k or 100k to spend, AND you determine that the &quot;real life&quot; costs associated with purchasing the plat are less than the &quot;in game&quot; costs of wasted time farming and general boredom that results from earning plat ... then buy the plat.<br />
<br />
And of course it's the uber guilds doing most of the plat selling ... do you really think that Yantis, et al have millions of plat for sale on each server because they buy it in batches of 100 from level 12 Druids who have been farming spider silks?  Not a chance ...<br />
<br />
If Furor had 100k in the bank, what would he spend it on?</div></div><hr />

Dots and Rez Stick recharges.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iskandar</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 03:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">By legal I meant you could get banned for it. Also the end game won't be trivialized by plat, but you could trivialize 1-60 with a shaman bot and gear off Ebay.<br />
<br />
Yes, again, the choice is ultimately up to you, but come on, have some respect for the goddamn spirit of the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomers</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 08:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok depending if you care to have halfling faction or not.  <br />
<br />
Go to Misty Ticket halfling newbie ground and where the opening in the wall is there are three guards that are basically chumps they are around level 35.  Kill them and loot only thier spears they sell for 10pp a piece and they always drop.  The respawn time is around 6 minutes.  There are more guards before the opening of the wall just follow the wall until you find one.  You can make around 300pp an hour here.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok if you work on Paineel Faction by killing Kobolds in the warrens you can kill the guards next to the bank in the City they drop some pp and weapon that sell for decent pp and you can bank there and sell.</div></div><hr />

Life's full of disappointment, isn't it ... *chuckles*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vamcoy</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 02:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wouldnt even bother getting paineel faction. I was there last night and gaurds now give faction hit. No more easy money for warriors. We cant solo and now they took away our money making tools to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">04-26-2003, 10:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;if ya turn into Richie Rich&quot;<br />
<br />
LOL.<br />
<br />
That just cracks me up. Richie Rich trying to &quot;taunt&quot; an orc pawn or something.<br />
<br />
In any event ... if you're a good race, and don't want to wreck faction with Halflings ... you can do the same thing killing dark elf guards in Neriak.<br />
<br />
:-)<br />
<br />
The best thing about killing guards is, you never have to worry about your standard farming classes competing with you. MOST of those mobs have some really good resists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TrilanBladefury</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 11:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">When I need cash, I always go to SolA. Most of the mobs drop FS and at the very least junk loot. There is a vendor in the zone, and it's hardly ever busy in there anymore. <br />
<br />
At 53 I can crawl through the zone pretty well only stopping about once every 45 min to regen hp. I usually stick to the bar and the surrounding area. <br />
<br />
I am sure that there are more lucrative places to go, but I have always liked sol a for cash. It's not very quick but in a 2-3 hour session I can make about 500 plat if i am lucky, sometimes more if all goes well.</div></div><hr />

Ella.  My wife is a 51 cleric and I'm a 51 warrior.  We were collecting spears for cash.  Ella tends to path close to where the 3 static spawn guards are.  Ella's lvl 50 and man is she tough to kill.  It took us 4.5 minutes to kill her.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khazzuz</div><div class="date">05-09-2003, 06:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I also am a 53 warrior and also hunt Sol A for plat.  It's not too bad, and the vendor in the zone certainly makes a big difference.  I average about 200-250 plat an hour, right around where the previous poster said.  Only problem is after a couple hours you get fairly encumbered lugging all that stuff around, and there is no bank within a reasonable distance, I have to run back through Nektulos back to PoK.  <br />
<br />
I haven't seen this mentioned yet but the geonids  in Crystal Caverns are also a great place to camp if you can solo them reasonably or get a healer to come with you.  They drop a bunch of gems, but unfortunately they ALWAYS seem to be camped.  Most likely have to wait around for them to come free though.  While you are waiting though, go kill some Ry'gorr miners and collect the velium, stick em in the bank and sell them in the bazaar.  The blocks will go fast at 75p.  <br />

I went there a few days ago, and just selling the runes and weapons there, I got almost 1k. The acrylia that drops goes for 50-100pp each on my server. Since the revamp, I've seen no Sk's or chanter mobs around so its easy pickings =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Runnyeye goblins funded shikarii's fletching skills from 100-209 :D ( can make about 100pp an hour-plus the black alloy hat/medallion sells decently too in the bazaar )</div></div><hr />
