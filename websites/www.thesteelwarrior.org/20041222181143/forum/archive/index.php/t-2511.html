<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">08-12-2003, 10:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">heh, LFG isn't my problem at the moment, its the groups themselves.<br />
<br />
As a 65 warrior with pretty good gear, an EB weapon, elemental flagged, guild groups aside the only pickup groups I have had recently have been in Tier 2 planes - Plane of Valor and Crypt of Decay most recently - in groups where everyone else in the group is between 55 and 60.  Its pretty sad when your virtue from the night before drops and you ask the cleric for buffs and get Heroism.<br />
<br />
If 65 warriors are having to take groups with lvl 55 - 60 clerics / shamans and DPS where are the lvl 60 warriors grouping ? Karnors Castle with the high 40's crowd ?<br />
<br />
For what its worth I've met some really cool people who play very well, but when Guild Group = Sol Ro / EPs and an AA every hour and Pickup Group = PoVelks and an AA every 3 hours I begin to wonder why I ever put LFG up. <br />
<br />
Makes me wish they'd bring back the zone flag requirements.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">08-12-2003, 10:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh, and while Im ranting...<br />
<br />
The other thing that has been annoying me in these groups is the whinging about the XP rate.  When you're grouping with a lvl 58 enchanter who was level 50 last week and they die on every pull from tashing on inc and then sitting its no bloody wonder.  And if you suggest they go to seb and learn to play its &quot;euw Seb, the XP sucks there...&quot;<br />
<br />
Had a level 52 monk join me and a couple of guildies in PoI last night farming gate talisman bits to leech XP and we got the last bit we needed in 20 mins and he made some comment about the XP only being ok cos he'd made a blue and a half.<br />
<br />
Damn it, I levelled from 55 to 60 in Seb, it took me 4 months, I made about a blue an hour in most groups, it was damn good XP and I LIKED IT.<br />
<br />
phew... I feel better now... deep breath.</div></div><hr />

I remember the blue an hour, that sucked. Good thing for me though, that pop came out when I was 56 or so! Lemme tell yah something though, I was pretty stoked when I won 2 lammys once :cool:</div></div><hr />

I remember it taking my Shaman about 3 weeks just to get from 51 to 52 in KC. (I played Shaman to 54, then made Warrior).<br />
<br />
I know that had nothing to do with the topic, but oh well.<br />
<br />
As groups go for me, when we're not raiding, we usually get a &quot;pick up raid&quot; of a group or two, we really don't raid anything, just kill things for the joy of killing them.  I could really care less how much XP I get anymore, I'm 65, I've got 80+ AA's.  I'm not in an Ele Plane guild.</div></div><hr />

Try a blue ever 3 hours as GREAT XP. Ahh 59th in Kunark. <br />
<br />
Grouped witha 65 warrior today, married to a rogue no less, who kept on planting the mobs back in the wall. <br />
<br />
I think LDoN is begining to scare me. These young whipper snappers just don't have leet Unreast/Mistmoor/CT/SolB/LG dungen skills I do :p. <br />

I can assure you 59 was as much a hell level when I went through it as it was when you did.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valeris</div><div class="date">08-13-2003, 03:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally i think POP exp is way overpowered, it's cause they want to keep you hooked to the grindstone chucking out AA after AA and it works - problem is AA's are one of the biggest causes of balance problems there is - how do you tune encounters to be equally challenging to a 65 warr with no AA's and a 65 warr with 200? (let alone an entire group of characters).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">08-13-2003, 04:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I find that raid XP is almost as good as joining inconsistent groups for XPing.  Well, it's still obviously not anywhere as fast, but raid XP comes automatically and you don't have to put up with bad groups and the usual hassles of pickup groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomb</div><div class="date">08-13-2003, 04:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lol, i remember level 59 in Chardok, about 1 blue per hour when dual boxing or the cleric out of group with 20 percent race penalty.<br />
Now last weekend my guildleader asked if i wanted to come to PoEarth, he just had some chores to do (which took about 3 to 4  hours).<br />
In that time my bard made 60 percent regular exp in 58, dinged 59 and made another 6 or 7 percent regular exp there.... solo.<br />
I fortunately have rarely LFG issues lately, usually not that long to get a group in tactics, solro and lately earth.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, that's kinda true, but the kicker is that by late luclin there were actually places to XP.<br />
<br />
Anyone who's old school remembers doing fuckin level 45 killing guards somewhere...and it took FOREVER.  Doing 35-50 pre kunark was the real trick, I'd never want to do that again.  I plowed thru 59 on my necro in skyfire in 2 days, and I'd gladly do it again if it meant I never had to go back to that Barbarian camp in WK, or the druids in EC/WC.....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">08-13-2003, 06:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">PoP has to have better XP because it's actually balanced around the AAs.  In Luclin if you're a warrior and you have ND3 and AE Taunt you're pretty much fine.  Offense do not matter on fights that take forever and not even defense matters very much when you consider you can get through 2 rounds of max hits without any heals.  Take Emperor's 900ish melee, 2 rounds at max is 7200 which is a number reachable at Luclin.  Compare this to PoP where it'd be unthinkable anyone can survive 2 rounds of max hits on anything that does a nontrivial amount of damage.  This also makes every bit of DPS count because it is nontrivial to prolong a battle.  Whereas in Luclin you don't really feel the difference between a high AA person and low/none AA person because it's pretty much impossible to lose a battle once you know what to expect unless there are serious lapses in healing, in PoP everyone does have to pull their weight somewhat.</div></div><hr />

personally i LOVE dungeons, even my druid prefered dungeons to outdoor zones... did quite a bit of time in MM and splitpaw, now my warrior/cleric goes to ToFS and nurga... kind of planning a beat down for MM soon, should be fun to go back in there with some hps for a change...<br />
<br />
as far as LFG, i don't for the most part.<br />
i put the grab on some folks in guild and we go somewhere, granted my warrior and cleric are both 51, but that is why i am in a guild, if i wanted to be LFG for hours on end, i would be guildless<br />

There was not even a point in opening tier2 to 55. you can EASILY get 60 in tier1, and on the loathsome and predatory creepers in PoN 62-63 should be more than doable. we just exped there, I am half through 62 now and have yet to exp in tier2. The problem is that the whiners whined to much, but I doubt they even know that a castle in PoN exist, and the zone ends at the large river for them.</div></div><hr />

I liked Najena. Better than ToFS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flair</div><div class="date">08-13-2003, 03:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think Ninja was comparing the experience/ambience/dungeoness of najena vs ToFS...I agree with him Najena is a cooler dungeon (although I liked TOFS).  The OLD Najena was a thing of beauty...the J Boot camp being a classic of bad design.  I don't think his comment had anything to do with &quot;which to hunt between at the same level.<br />
<br />
Context: I grew up in the days where you had 2 options to get high level experience: Sol B or L Guk (or Oggok guards if you gotv desperate).  There was no lfg tool so if you couldnt find a group in Sol B you hoofed it down to L guk.  There were no egress/coth spells so you showed up at a dungeon you had to find a way to the group w/o killing them.  Also no graveyards, heck few corpse summoners, so when you died/wiped...you relied on other folks in an ajacent camp to help you get your body.   Heh and we walked both ways up hill in the snow to! <br />
<br />
So to say I have little respect for the current &quot;created in a test tube of power leveling&quot; toons is an understatement.   Often I boggle at how seriously/tensely a pick up group handles a mundane camp like the S Pad in BoT.  There are some good players left but I'm hoping LDON brings back some of the difficulty to the game....I think that would do alot to build comradery amongst players and their skill level.</div></div><hr />

I am half through 62 now and have yet to exp in tier2. <br />
<br />
Trondir, if you never exped in tier 2, how do you know they hae been ruined for exp?  I find it some what surprising as I still sometimes exp there(far more relaxing than BoT, the New KC) and with no real problem.<br />
<br />
As far as the whiners, I was in a small famly guild that was in fact having some real issues with the flagging system.  We had 3 of us flagged, 2 more 60 +who where going thru hell getting trial groups(bards and shaman are not first choices at all for trial groups), and those of us who had gotten flagged, and who had advanced faster than the rest in the guild had to decide if we wanted to hang with our guild(that was why we where in the guild, we enjoyed hanging out) for low exp, or go LFG for faster exp and a chance to go new places.  We did not whine, but at the same time, PoP flagging was a real issue for us.  Note that the largest whining came from those who threw a hissy about all the 'n00bs' that where going to invade 'their' zones.  And yet for the most part, things are pretty mellow, and finding a level appropriate camp is fairly easy(HoH and PoS both are undercamped, CoD frequently is, tier 1 is not nearly as crowded...BoT is a nightmare, but can't win them all I guess).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I gave up on tier 2 pretty fast after they removed the flags,  grouping with characters that die in 2 rounds of agro cause of low lvl and totally crap gear is too much hassle. No wonder those ppl want knights to tank, they die when a mob looks at them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">08-14-2003, 02:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I remember hearing that originally you have to pass all 6 trials in Justice to just get to PoV/PoS.  Of course put a pickup group in Valor or any of the new tier 2+ xp zones probably can't even get past Execution trial let alone anything else.  It's pretty weird people always think upper tier planes are better for xp but they really aren't.  Even before the masses moved into BoT it was never worth it for straight XP grinding due to the high number of gating mobs.  Most of the great XP made in the upper planes are actually reliant on Charm since higher planes have more powerful mobs to charm (Fire charmables are extremely strong).  I think PoEarth has an XP bonus but other than XP in the elemental planes aren't exactly that great unless you've a good group that can take on the white+ cons.  If you're just killing blue trash you might as well be in Valor (except Earth, but Earth can't support very many groups).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Guess... yes,  on my OLD server. I had all the flags done for the zones that got opened, and suddenly only Drunder was left for me to exp &quot;in peace&quot;<br />
Oh and small family guild or not, I did infact exe trial and BoT key in small family style guilds with the help of 1 or 2 highlevel friends.<br />
Also, Shaman is not a first choice? dont make me laugh, I did exe trial with an AE slowing shaman. We owned it easily.<br />
<br />
Note that the largest whining came from those who threw a hissy about all the 'n00bs' that where going to invade 'their' zones.<br />
well guess what, it did happen. I saw alot of people that have NO business in BoT (pickup tower raids anyone? they happen ALL the time!)<br />

I did the unrest/MM/CT/LG/solb route for dungeon crawls.  Matter fact when I got a bit lazy on my leveling was 58 and most my guild had hit 60.  I buckled down and solo'd in solb LDC's / SS.  If I remember right, took me 40ish hours to ding 60.  Go go gadget 2 box'd cleric.  Not an LDC / bug / SS would live for hours :P.  I musta sold / gave away 15-20 BCP's and Black Chitin Legs (I'd pull over to death beetle too :P).<br />
<br />
The hardest levels def were 35-50 tho as my original toon a cleric.  Things didn't get too good til 44 when I could finally solo well.  Hrm... does Happ Dremblenod ring any bells?? ;)  Did that til 48 or so, then Freeport guards til 50.  Still have the SS's of me and a wiz friend duoing em.</div></div><hr />

My route was Everforst and BB till about 17 ( I was scared to go into the big wide world being a puny warrior :p)/Loio/FM fort/Splitpaw (first dungeon taste )/some OT/DL-Solb-LGuk/KC.... 55-56 was the worst round of hell ever as PoP was out and I couldn t get hold of it in Europe. But friends kindly offered to exp the slow way with me in AR, VL,OS and UP. After 56 it was PoP all the way. Kind of sad I never really did a lot of grinding in OS as the times I ve been there I ve had a blast:( <br />
<br />
And yeah, even us relative newbs notice how skill in pickup groups has been reduced to just casting a spel on inc and going into autopilot. I remember a brilliant group in KC where we were trained in hands room. The lvl 51 enc we had, had the godlike powers to keep 8 mobs busy, while I was being rezzed midfight. Dropping that last mob felt great :) Get 2 adds in PoP and you re generally screwed :(<br />

And since the vast majority of the groups I'm in are guildies only (sometimes duo with a shaman guildy/buddy), it gives them a chance to A) sharpen their dungeon crawling skills, and B) learn how to better manage their aggro with me as MT.   And dungeons are just infinitely more fun anyway. :)</div></div><hr />

I remember my first night there. I got a group at the chef camp I think it was. OMG the exp was like 2 blues an hour, like twice as good as Karnors. I was amazed. Well, midnight came creeping up on me so I decided I should log. Well, I had my trusty EQatlas map and was determined to find the zone out.  So i'm running around following the map print out... I go down, and down, and down, and down and I see this huge pad with lots of frogs with a door behind it. I figured the zoenout was behind the door. <br />
<br />
&quot;A froglok krup wizard begins to cast a spell&quot;<br />
&quot;You are hit with 400 points of non melee damage!&quot;<br />
&quot;Your invisibility fades&quot;<br />
&quot;You  have been slain by 500 Frogloks!&quot;<br />
&quot;Loading please wait&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, somehow I managed to miss a crucial turn and ran down into the disco area. Not knowing the camp names, I tried to guide someone down and get my corpse. About an hour later  this person retrieves my corpse. Great way to end the first night in seb if I do say so myself  :D</div></div><hr />
