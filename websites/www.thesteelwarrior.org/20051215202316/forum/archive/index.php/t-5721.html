<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">02-16-2004, 05:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is a work in progress, hopefully we can get some good info as more people spend time in Ferubi. There seems to be a pretty good opportunity for getting a named in this zone, it is still unclear if the single groupable named are triggered or on some sort of timer.<br />
<br />
Any additional info would be appreciated!<br />
<br />
1. The most efficient way to get to the named are is to zone in from Riwwi. There are less mobs in the way. Most static spawns do not see invis, but on occasion they do so be sure to con everything on the way in.<br />
<br />
2. The vast majority of the mobs can be single pulled by a competent puller, in occassion you may get a 2 pull, but so far all of the non-named appear to be mezzable.<br />
<br />
3. It would appear that all of the wanderers see invis. I have yet to encounter one that didn't. My group would charge the wanderers when they would get to a spot that would result in the least amount of adds.<br />
<br />
Here is what I have so far on the named using the map below -<br />
<br />
1. Pxet Elite Blademaster (loot and trigger)<br />
2. Hexx Gkon<br />
3. Pxet Elite Spearmaster (loot and trigger)<br />
4. Hexxt N`Vak Tkan<br />
5. Smith Rondo (Weapon Master Vtiink Vzaan trigger)<br />
6. Pxet Elite Brawler (loot and trigger)<br />
7. Packmaster Skoiat Pizak (Raid mob)<br />
8. Pixtt Votal (ZMV pet)<br />
9. Zun`Muram Votal (Raid mob)<br />
10. Pixtt Votal (ZMV pet)<br />
11. Pxet Elite Hammermaster (loot and trigger)<br />
12. Pxet Vzanki Kzan<br />
<br />
Other named - Rav Ptvin and Rev Hunter appear to be random spawns in several locations. They also appear to wander, but this is not certain. Hexxt Pzik Shziaak <br />
is an archer that can spawn anywhere other archers can spawn. Pxet Elite Spearman is listed on Allakhazam's but this mob may not exist (probably meant Spearmaster).<br />
<br />
The Pxet Elite _____master mobs not only drop loot, but also broken weapon pieces. Once you collect the 4 broken weapon pieces, you hand them in to Smith Rondo to trigger Weapon Master Vtiink Vzaan.<br />
<br />
The Pixtt Votal are Zun`Muram Votal's pets and do not drop loot.<br />
<br />
Time equipped groups should be able to take all but the raid mobs. A high end EP, near Time group should do fine with a warrior tanking. New to EP or pre-EP guilds should consider multi-grouping the named. 2-3 groups would be fine for mid level raid guilds. Really the limit is going to be the quality of your tanks. I would say bare minimum HP for a warrior to tank with defensive and a few healers is going to be 8k or so buffed. The named hit for 1200-1400 (I forget exactly how much) and they hit fast. I am pretty sure that all of the non-raid named are partially slowable.<br />

I don't know which way is right and I'd recommend just kill everything around where the Elites are to make sure.  <br />
<br />
Pixtt Votal is Zun'Muram Votal's pet.  Doesn't drop anything pretty sure.</div></div><hr />

Weapon Master Vtiink Vzaan, Rav Ptvin, and Rev Hunter. I do not have any spawn locations for these mobs. <br />
Weapons Master Vtiink is triggered, as stated earlier.<br />
<br />
Rav Ptvin are also triggered mobs, as a part of a different event.  They're not really &quot;named&quot; in the sense that they drop any loot, they just have capitalized names.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baxter</div><div class="date">02-17-2004, 04:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Rav Hunter Spawns as a wandering dog in the ZMV room, has PH which I can't specifically identify.<br />
<br />
All of the elites are static spawns with set but different respawn timers.  Blademaster is a little over 2 hours, Hammermaster is about the same, and I haven't had the chance to time the others.    <br />
<br />
There's a couple other static spawns, but I leave it to you to learn them.</div></div><hr />

Once you have all four, hand em into Smith Rondo to spawn Weapon Master Vtiink Vzaan. <br />
<br />
Pretty entertaining little encounter there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">02-17-2004, 11:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A little more evidence that the Pxet Elite XXX mobs are somehow triggered - last night there were 2 Pxet Elite Brawler spawned in the exact same location. Both where up when we got to the zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baxter</div><div class="date">02-17-2004, 05:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I still don't think they are spawned.  I spend most of my time in the southern halls, and the Elite respawn without me doing anything in their rooms.<br />
<br />
As for Rondo, what does the Weapon Master hit for?  I know Triadica did him recently on my server, Krassus wanna share the sekrets with us?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Killed him yesterday and got a hybrid belt with 12ac 90 hp/mana 7 wis/int and a bunch of other stats and resists.<br />
<br />
He showed up half way through killing the blademaster, droped the chanter and sham before slow but we still got him.<br />
<br />
The blademaster was in the place where the spear master is listed as being, they are likely switched around.</div></div><hr />

I think he hits for like 1600 but I didn't keep track.  Has 4 reasonably strong adds with some pretty hard to resist and annoying (but not too powerful) AEs.  Most of them will mez.</div></div><hr />

Killed [Rev Ptvin] yesterday and got a hybrid belt with 12ac 90 hp/mana 7 wis/int and a bunch of other stats and resists. <br />
Perhaps I was thinking of Rev Hunter, then.  I know one of the two(or a third mob with a very similar name) is a mob you'll encounter during the Packmaster fight, but when Baxter said Rev Hunter was a roaming dog in Votal's room, I assumed it was the other of the two I was remembering.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarelin</div><div class="date">02-18-2004, 08:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Killed Rev Ptvin and got an Int-Caster ranged item. 80mana, 60hp and so on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shabba</div><div class="date">02-18-2004, 10:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Would this be suicide for a group of non VT equipped characters?  Say an 8kish tank 4kish mana cleric 4kish mana shaman.  Group would have around 100+ aas average with the warrior full defensive.  Probably have a solid pre VT ranger and Monk in the group also.  Monk has 200+ aa's and is a good puller.<br />
<br />
EDIT: I just read deeper in another thread that a pre-EP guild should probably bring 3-4 groups.  In that post they said it probably would be worth the time to do so...does everyone agree that this might be a could place to go on a raid night for us?</div></div><hr />

At 7kHP, 1700 AC, no defensive, I got rolled like a turtle on the autobahn by the Pxet Elite Blademaster.</div></div><hr />
