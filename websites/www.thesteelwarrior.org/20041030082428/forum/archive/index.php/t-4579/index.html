<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nytewolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Currently im Main Handing a BoC and my off hand is a CohS. In the main hand I placed an Anger 3 Augment, Yes I doubled up on the hate already on a BoC. My logic is I have 2 chances to proc every round. My question is what can I do for my off hand, and what do you all think of what I did with the Aug on BoC? Normally I would ask this well before doing it but the boards have been down quite a while. <br />
<br />
I have a Split Blade of Destructions, I have not augmented it yet Am debating on Auging it or keeping it for a DPS weapon when I am an not MT. Any advice you all have on an off hand weapon for aggro other then the copper hammer. I dont care for the knockback on the proc . So please advise the old man<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">offhand hmm aug the splitblade with anger3 and then pick up a nifty 2hr for DPS when you are not MT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Krassus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">that splitblade should be augmented =D and just pick up a wmbs or windblade for when not tanking until you get a better upgrade</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Azrael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Or you could jsut leave it alone.  A warrior in my guild has a BoC with anger 3 on it and he pulls aggro of anyone.  In fact, he ias almost always the one tanking everything (except Uber Mobs's).  If you want over kill aggro then put anger 3 on the sbod, if not just use that as your main hand weapon and keep the bot offhand while you tank.  You can also get the 150 dd pproc from EV on there.  Its pretty good and almsot never resisted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think you have multiple questions in your post:<br />
<br />
Q1: Was your BoC decision good?<br />
 Heck yes....2x proc main hand of anger 3 very smart.  Odds are you wont be replacing this weapon set for awhile.<br />
<br />
Q2: What to do with your offhand?<br />
<br />
I'd sell the split blade of destruction (trade value still quite high). Unless you want to create a dual wield dps combo.  My reasoning: there are other 1 handed agro weapons out there and if you do mod this with Anger you will probably replace it with something else down the road.  Then you would have a dilemna: keep an antiquated weapon (losing out on considerable pp) or  strip the weapon to sell losing your points.<br />
<br />
Q3: What else offhand?<br />
<br />
I guess it depends on your goal.  If its to max agro I'd suggest the Great blade of storms (from BoT tower) or Cord Hilted Spiked Driver (PoI dragon) and mod with an anger 2 or the yak mod from D guk (both being 510 pts and mitigates risk of &quot;wasting&quot; ldon points).<br />
<br />
If its to add dps...perhaps you should save for club of mad researcher or the d guk blade (1150 &amp; 1492 ldon pts respectively) and mod them with the +2 dam mod from the N Ro camp.   You could also keep the Split Blade and add a + dam proc onto it.<br />
<br />
I agree with the posters above though: for DPS mode you probably better off with a 2 hander with a dam proc mod.</div></div><hr />
