<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dafrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I use Sars, and the leadership AA that assigns MA target ring blinds my retina out.<br />
<br />
Basically I am interested in knowing what file the MA target ring is under the UI so I can put in my own.<br />
<br />
Could any GUI gurus be able to tell me what file I need to replace to affect this?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

This is a bug that happens if you are using a custom target circle which hasn't been updated to include the new definitions that SoE introduced with GoD in Feb 2004. (that custom target ring was last updated Nov 2003.) They actually have a runic device, and are non-animated. If yours is either flashing or an ugly solid ring, then you need to edit the TargetIndicator.cfg file in your custom folder to include the new xml definitions for the Assist and Mark rings.<br />
<br />
The fact that it only showed up now rather then in feb is just a shakedown of how the bug turned up.<br />
<br />
To fix this, you need to copy the files &quot;assist.tga&quot; and the files &quot;mark1.tga&quot; to &quot;mark6.tga&quot;. (7 files total) from the default UI folder into your custom UI folder.<br />
<br />
Then open both the TargetIndicator.cfg files in your default folder and your custom folder, and compare them.<br />
<br />
Stuff that is different in the two files include 5 new definitions for &quot;AssistMarker&quot; and &quot;Marker0&quot; to &quot;Marker3&quot;.<br />
<br />
Copy that section of the code from the Default file into the custom file.<br />
<br />
Also note that each &quot;Marker#&quot; has its own opacity and height settings, so a few edits are needed if your custom circle has file definitions at the top that SoE went and customized in the Mark/Assist area of the file. (in my case, i had to remove the following from the top of the file:<br />
FadeStart=0.0<br />
FadeEnd=2.0<br />
OpaqueStart=0.0<br />
OpaqueEnd=0.1<br />
InitialLength=1<br />
GrowSpeed=1<br />
FloorOffset=0.0<br />
<br />
and paste it into EACH con-color definition that follows it, &quot;VeryEasy&quot; to &quot;Deadly&quot;. In your case, the number of definitions you need to copy down may be different.)<br />
<br />
<br />
Important: if you edit the file in the Default folder and leave it there, the patcher will just overwrite it next time EQ starts up.<br />
<br />
After you do that, you just need to restart EQ, and the flashing should be fixed.<br />
<br />
While editing the file, I found it helpful to also edit the color of the assist ring to some other color than white (255,255,255) so that the ring showed up better against even-con mobs. I changed my assist ring to pink (Red=255, Green=102, Blue=255). That helped a lot. You can also change the color for each of the Mark rings too.<br />
