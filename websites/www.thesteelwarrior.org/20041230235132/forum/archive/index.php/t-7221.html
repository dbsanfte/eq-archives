It's a pretty easy concept.  When you die rather than loosing experience you incur a debt.  At level 10 a single death incurs a debt of 200 points.  So using one death at level 10 as an example, this is what happens.  You start off with 200 debt points, each time you kill an NPC, who for our example will be worth 40 experience points, rather than the whole 40 going towards your leveling what happens is 20 experience points goes towards you leveling and 20 experience goes towards paying off your debt.  Which means that until you pay off your debt completely, you have to kill twice as many NPCs to gain the same amount of experience towards leveling as you would normallly.<br />
<br />
Or put another way, until your debt is paid off it takes twice as long to level.<br />
<br />
I think my highest amount of debt at any one time was 720 points or there abouts.  But I make it a point that when the going gets tough, the tough get going... :P</div></div><hr />

At level 18 it was 950 exp per dirt nap; I've not died at level 19 yet.<br />
<br />
Oh...2571 was the worst I saw for myself. I remember the number vividly because I'd just finished bitching about having over 2300 debt... :p</div></div><hr />

Should be 21 soon. Unless I get gunned down by 12 purple con mobsters near of my contacts...again.</div></div><hr />

I didn't even notice it though as it disappeared really quickly (one group session doing indoor missions with a bunch of really good players).</div></div><hr />

With a bit of unluck I will do all of 22 without ever having been out of debt.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Toga</div><div class="date">06-03-2004, 12:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Level 34  85,000 debt . Was hella fun tho , wouldn't take back a second of it. Was a really fun task force. Debt is easyto make up if you have someone higher level than you generate a mission and you and a few friends go and wipe it out. Can make about 125k xp / hour in a good level 39 mission.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Doggabone</div><div class="date">06-03-2004, 07:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">500 or so, but I've only got one toon into the low teens and the big debts are comin ... so far, I've almost always managed to avoid having more than one *death debt* at a time.  Altho I do often gather a new one moments after clearing off the old one *hehe*.</div></div><hr />
