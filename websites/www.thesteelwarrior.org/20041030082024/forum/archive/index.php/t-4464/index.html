<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Myrtiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi guys!<br />
<br />
Well I dinged lvl 60 at last (w00t!)...<br />
Ok, I ain't got great gear but well, it aint that bad neither, the biggest problem is my waist item/haste item: fbss.<br />
I know I really should have better by now but I ain't got a lot of pp (around 10k-ish atm) and for that money I could really use for some other armor upgrades....<br />
<br />
So my question: Are there any easy/soloable haste item quests? or do I need to get my guild kill some Dragons and the like? (ain't got much dkp neither after my Vindi BP :p )<br />
<br />
Any help would be very appreciated!!<br />
<br />
Cheers,</div></div><hr />

The higher end items with the highest haste (36% from reports), will take some time, but you can go with a lower haste augment and a middle of the road item to put it on.<br />
<br />
Check out some ldon sites and see if that is a viable option for you, and its free!  (assuming you have the time to devote to ldon adventures, of course)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Actually you are doing pretty good for armor for your level.   All you need is to upgrade haste.  Some come to mind are soulscream belt, RBB and RBG  might be more than you can afford right not just something to think about.  OR just do adventures out the ying yang and buy the Haste aug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nomryh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Soulscream Belt is EASILY campable w/ a slower, cleric &amp; 2 melees... its in Veksar, just need invis &amp; run to the easy camp. It drops there quite a lot, we had 5 drops in 2 hours I think</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kaluas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hey,<br />
i`ve got the Belt of Grey Flesh ( 510 AP in MM ) and a 10 AC aug on it ( also 510 AP in MM ). And if you save up ur points u can get for 1150 AP in MM the 36% haste aug.... you aug that on the belt and u have a great belt item :)<br />
Check out my magelo. I have the belt and the AC item already.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gerald</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm still using a cloak of flames, and my guild (been in it a year) is only a coirnav and rathe kill from PoTime. I just have really bad luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Khazzuz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I can't agree with Nomryh more about the soulscream belt.  I do have to say you probably won't expect to see 5 of them drop in 2 hours though :)  I'm level 62 and I regularly duo this camp with a 63 shammy just to give you an idea of how hard it actually is, which is to say not very.  The drop rate is so good and the camp so easy that my guild has basically just started to farm these belts for our melee that need haste upgrades.  I'd say for the effort and time investment its hard to beat, I recommend spending 3 hours to get one, even if you only have it for a short while you can still sell it for some nice coin when you're done with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Don't diss the 36% haste items, because with an Enchanter Haste buff (68% from most higher level Enchanter Haste buffs) you reach the 100% cap, so unless you have a Bard with Overhaste song going, you won't see any effect from a better haste item.<br />
<br />
Unless you are grouped with a Shaman whom can only haste up to 50%, which will still leave you at a respectable 86% haste.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh, and the Haste augment that was mentioned is the one used in this Augmented Helmet (http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=44301&amp;slot1=42214&amp;slot2=42167&amp;slot3=42165) in the third slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Myrtiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thx a lot for all the help guys!!<br />
Altho I don't think I would be able to get that much adv. points, and even if I would get em I'd spend em on anger augs :)<br />
<br />
So, let's get a shm and get that soulbelt-thingy!! /grin<br />
<br />
Cheers,</div></div><hr />

<br />
Shaman get swift like the wind at 63, which is 60%, taking anyone with a 36 item to 96% haste, which is close enough to the cap for government work.<br />
