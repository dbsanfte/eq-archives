(Well at least shammies got group Q too. That's nice.)</div></div><hr />

Group Q is a great idea imo on the other hand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aonodorus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">wipe inc, camp a druid</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i think as long as they put it at something less than 90% it wont be a big deal imo, or maybe make it cost a component like the necro rezz.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bourbon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Whole lot of asuming going on at this point.  The spell isn't assigned to a class yet, has a level of 0, mana 0 and recast 0, for all we know it's a place holder or been put in the spell data to freak out data miners.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It is going to be an AA skill or the epic effect, and it is going to piss alot of people off :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bonequest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">While they are at it, I hope they make the new warrior epic proc DI.  That would be as balanced as druid rez at least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">This is a terrible idea (druid rez)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Brede</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">They ought to make it like the old D&amp;D druid spell Reincarnation where you get rezzed, but there's a random chance you come back as a different race.<br />
<br />
Seriously though, I don't see this as unbalancing as everyone else seems to. I don't see getting a cleric camped out in time as being a vital part of the challenge of this game, and it's not going to do anything to make a cleric less desirable (not that that would really be so horrible, they're already by far the most desirable class in the game).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Even if it's a 0 exp res, a Druid res would be helpful in some group and raid instanced content.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, SK's (who's parent class can res) are the only Knight without res ability.<br />
<br />
BB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>lokkak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I think it is long overdue.  I have played a 65 Cleric and Druid.  D&amp;D had druid res, since a druid was a &quot;cleric&quot; and had access to a number of &quot;cleric&quot; spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I personally would have 0 problems with druids/shaman having some form of rez....<br />
<br />
(Note I didn't say 96% or anything, maybe like a 75-85% rez. Nothing that clerics can bitch more than usual about.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Call of the wild is clearly beastlord rez.<br />
<br />
Stupid people.</div></div><hr />

That would be great lol, maybe add bulwark of vie on the 2nd 1hs'er~<br />

K, lets see Necromancers and Druids go hand and hand, one can only charm undead, one can only charm animals, they both can succor, they both can heal, both can give lev, only necros can rez... Chances are they are giving it to druids to even it out maybe? and the component will be something annoying and hard to attain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Fuzzee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Why am I not a fan if it is indeed  druids who get it (Call of the WILD, though I'd actually be in favor of a BL rez or a ranger self rez, hahahaha) is because then in non high-end GoD, druids will be able to fully replace clerics.  Oh nos, no uber hp buffies, but most of us can tank fine with Bo9 and BSS or SoT in BoT, Tactics, etc.  If druids get a rez then they'll dominate the LDoN role because then you have an evaker/healer/SNARER/tracker and C in the form of 9 for casters.  Clerics in LDoN currently do : Heal, Paci, and rez if needed.  Well, druids can heal as well as clerics in LDoN's when you only need a healer every 3rd mob.  I personally would hate seeing clerics lose rez, because that ups druids and then bumps shamans yet again as the priests version of the SK.  Though in LDoN Shammies can almost heal if well equipped/aa'd, but in GoD you're going to have trouble as a shammy grouping because slow is either mitigated, resisted, or the enc with the pooka pet can already do it.  So Druid power goes up, clerics get knocked down, shamans get nothing to match it (though Group Q is VERY nice idea).  I mean to tell the truth, the only reason I like cleric healers in BoT/LDoN is the fact they can rez and I don't trust 2/3 of the people who fight in such places.  But of course... I may be biased being the best friend of a shaman and the brother of a cleric... and an ex kunark era druid.   But still... druid rezzing. Doesn't sound right.  It's like wizards mezzing.  Just not right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Let me clarify why I am opposed to this.  The blending, or cannibalism if you will, of core skills between classes is just design laziness on SoEs part.  Develop UNIQUE class skill/competence areas...don't cannibilize existing ones and make each class LESS unique.<br />
<br />
/shrug I still hate the idea 2-boxes, p levelers and other crap that didnt exist in 1999 as well (not to mention the designated hitter in baseball!).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Want to make playing druid more fun? how about the new and unique skill to transform into differnt animals,dire wolf, bear, boar form... wait that would require some work at coding something new, scratch that!</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, that just requires playing World of Warcraft.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Lelith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">This kind of rez ( IE 0 exp rez ) is mainly usefull to park a retired druid at some place and use it as a coh bot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Thats from the first DnD, expect to see wildshape (polymorphing) in adventures online, DnD online and all the newer DnD based games (there are 2 or 3 of them out there now in the works)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">&quot;On the other hand, SK's (who's parent class can res) are the only Knight without res ability.&quot;<br />
<br />
Well, if it's a druid rez and it goes in, then you SK's will have something in common with Rangers!<br />
<br />
See, there is a silver lining!<br />
<br />
:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Pumilio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">it's not a druid rez.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">It is http://p202.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathfrm22.showMessage?topicID=1372.topic<br />
<br />
it is just a no xp res.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">It is http://p202.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathfrm22.showMessage?topicID=1372.topic<br />
<br />
it is just a no xp res.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, that's right and wrong.<br />
<br />
It doesn't restore XP, it just shoots you back to your body, but you can get an XP rez later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Nothing &quot;right and wrong&quot; about it, it is druid and shaman rez.  It is equivalent to the cleric level 14 Reanimation (0% xp rez).  You can still get an XP rez after that one too.<br />
<br />
Compare the raw spell data for Call of the Wild and Reanimation.  Only a couple of small details are different.  They even share the same icon, cast time, recast time, and range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">What sassinak said, we use no xp res's as a work around when we make bridges in sky.</div></div><hr />
