I'm just starting EQ again, haven't played in about two years.  I've decided to reroll my iksar warrior for a number of reasons.  I'm kinda out of the loop on equipment, so I was wondering if you guys could help me out.  I have 8k saved up.  Here's my magelo http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1046620<br />
<br />
Also, which expansions are good, in regards to needed content?   I'm thinking of LDoN right now... I have the original three.<br />
Thanks<br />

Until then you are good enough in any way but weapons. You might want to get one of each kind to keep skills up.<br />
<br />
As for expansions, that depends on what you plan to do. LDoN is good for groups and getting some good gear without raids. PoP is now, with the opening of PoK to all, something for xp in higher levels. LoY is more mid level but not that popular for anything but increased bank space.<br />
<br />
If you look out there might be some bundles to get multiple expansions (all but GoD) for a decent price.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your gear should last until mid 40'ties and save your plat until then.</div></div><hr />
