<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have HOTT, Health 3, Delegate MA.<br />
<br />
I have 4 points saved up.<br />
<br />
What would you suggest I buy next?<br />
<br />
Some have suggested the obvious, offense.<br />
<br />
Is mana enhancement of much benefit to casters?<br />
<br />
Is Spell Awareness anything more than a gimmick?<br />
<br />
Other ideas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Curdlex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The advatage to spell Awareness that I can see is you will be able to find healers a lot faster and you can tell when a MOB is about to gate.  Since you can see your own parties spells being cast, it will answer that question if your slower is really being resisted alot or just afk, the healer is LOM because he is playing nuker, etc.   If you group with the same people all the time and you know the Mobs spell casting abilities then this will not be helpful.  If you like to due a lot of PU raids its a nice &quot;Convience&quot;.  Just my humble opinion.  (If you read the debate on whether the MA and MT should be 2 different people, you may want to consider Mark NPC)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Northerner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I like Spell Awareness, although they do need to add more filters for it.  As far as usefulness, it depends on what you are doing.  As a Rogue it is quite valuable for scouting out casters/buffers in many situations as well as a few small scouting purposes.  As I always have spelleffects off I like it just to tell what is casting when.  In general it is also nice for CHealing mobs and for noticing when mobs annul each other and things of that nature.<br />
<br />
Set Main Assist, Mark NPC and Delegate Mark are also all nice tools.  In a good team they can make a great difference if used properly.  Mana Enhancement is pretty trivial though, even most casters simply won't care about it.  Inspect Buffs is pretty useless to me, although I am sure some people like it for checking DI and the like.  Offensive Enhancement is important for a dps group (which I normally form) but I can't see it as  a priority for exp groups over some of the more tangeable LAAs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'd go ahead and get spell awareness. It's nice to know what mobs are casting, plus you can keep an eye on your nukers to see if they're actually doing anything (many aren't). Find PC is kinda nice too if you end up doing lots of pickup raids or ldons where people afk and get lost.<br />
<br />
Beyond that, I'd probably get HP just so you can pad your max number a bit more.<br />
<br />
Personally, I think mark npc is useless sinec you can't assist off it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You could tell if a mob was going to gate before this ability :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Arathena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Spell awareness is a lot more useful for other members of the party than it is for the tank. It's fairly valuable for a puller - It establishes quick identification of new mob types, and allows more effective decision making on when an FD puller should be FDing - I react to condemnation in a different manner than lure of frost, for example. More, it allows for more enlightened decisions for whomever is responsible for stopping gate/cheal, etc: The added mana effiency for say, an enchanter, to just let condemnation and greater healing and the like go through and concentrate on watching for cheal, gate, slow, AE spells, etc can be enormous.<br />
<br />
Edit to add: Mark NPC and Delegate Mark are excellent ways to give a character the ability to communicate the way the battle should flow. While a 'kill %t' next hot key functions, the delegate mark gives a way to sort out a number of identically named mobes from a pile. Again, this is not useful so much for the MA as it is for the group's CC options.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i did regen, <br />
<br />
the +100 or so mana dosent help much at 65 but at mid lvl i would hop on it like kerry on a waffle.<br />
<br />
spell casting is nice once your used to it.<br />
<br />
offence will make rogues and rangers happy<br />
<br />
inspect buff is nice for buffers<br />
<br />
the % and ma delagate ma are just fluff, if ya need it flee that group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Saeborne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Personally, I'm quite fond of the Delegate Main Assist skill.  That is probablly my favorite Leadership skill.<br />
<br />
Next, I'm a big fan of Health of Target's Target.  It helps because you can clearly see who the mob is hitting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bulbog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Raid Delegate MA is real nice.  For group it's alright too.  Save your chanters a step by making it so they don't have to /assist you to find out which mob to mez.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Pag0</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Have not read any of the other posts, just adding:<br />
<br />
<br />
Spell Awareness is priceless. Not only for you, but for pullers (know when to fade/fd), for stunning on cheal/gate, for knowing what your healer is casting if you want topay attention tothat, and so many other uses I simply can not name them. Knowing when you need to dispell mobs in Ikkinz because there is a buffing static right by them, priceless.<br />
<br />
Mark NPC is very nice, imo. I use it to mark ench pets, to mark pulls, and to help paci order.  I also have a line in my assist key to /mark 1 the mob I am tanking. I generally give pullers/enchies 2 and 3 using delegate.<br />
<br />
Mana Enchanement is basicly worthless. I got level 1, but only because I like having a solid green bar ;) 100 mana max just isn't worht the exp. Perhaps if you only have leader aa on during raids when it won't affect your exp much? Might help bards who are close to having an extra fade. Maybe.<br />
<br />
Offense Level 1 might be worth it, but my understanding was that it scales down in value as it scales up in cost.One of the last I will/did do. Would do this before doing Mana or Regen.<br />
<br />
Regen. I did Regen1 just to fill the bar, some people like regen (nice for necros and some SKs) again mostly worthless for the cost.<br />
<br />
Find Path is a bit harder to adjust to, but once you get people who use it they can really enjoy it.<br />
<br />
InspectBuffs2 is very nice for buffers. Before the timers went in, it was one of the priceless ones, now it is just beneficial nice to have. If you get level 1, it is very worthwhile to get level 2.<br />
<br />
If I was to do it over again, and I had what you already have, I would probably go: SpellAwareness, MarkNPC1, Delegate Mark, MarkNPC2 and 3, InspectBuffs1 and 2, Find Path to PC, NPC Health.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps, am sure some of my comments can be debated depending on how you play ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Holywrath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Get spell awareness next, it's too cool.   A really overlooked one is find path to PC, never have lost people again!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kilzalot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Spell Awareness is great, I love it.  Del MA is nice, especially for chanters in your group for when you have mobs to mezz.  After those 2 I'd say go ahead and do mana, can't hurt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The best thing about Spell Awareness is post-raid analysis.  You can REALLY learn a lot about raid effectiveness by going back and analyzing logs that can show spells being cast by whom.   <br />
<br />
The wizard who overaggroed can no longer clai9m to have cast 11 concussions between each nuke, swearing that concussion has a small chance at critting for 7k.   <br />
<br />
The cleric who was 2 seconds late on a CH Rotation causing the tank to die... the cleric who though it would be cool to nuke a little, the necro who was summonned &quot;while feigned, must've been a bug&quot;... all these things are now easier to analyze, and report on, and even confront people with if necessary, leading to improved performance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Hinterdir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">i'm maxed on GL Points, so i usualy give GL to someone who still needs points and the stuff i miss most than is HoTT and Spellawareness.<br />
unless there is a chanter in group i usualy don't even bother to delegate MA.<br />
<br />
there are however situations where every bit counts ,)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">HoTT is by far the best Leader AA IMO.  I feel crippled without it now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I took a look thru the leadership abilities, and I felt they all looked like absolute trash for me. <br />
<br />
Are they strictly raid only tools, meant for controlling idiocy, or do they actually have some value?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">The only one that's more than just a toy in my book is HoTT.  It's just nice to have an instant update when you lose aggro and to know who has it and know instantly when you have it back.  Sounds silly, but it's one of those things that after you've used it for a while you don't want to be without.  Delegate Main Assist is nice for enchanters so they can easily tell which mob you're on for mezzing, spell casting awareness is good for pullers, and to some extent for everyone just so you know when stuff like slow is cast, whether a heal is coming, and when a mob is gating etc  (you can already see all this stuff if you have everything turned on, so this basically just makes it easier.<br />
<br />
None of them are crucial, but I really like HoTT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Bruenorg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">None of them are crucial, but I really like HoTT.<br />
<br />
Agreed.  Warriors like their HoTT like casters do their KEI.  It isn't as useful in your typical group grind as it is on raids but nonetheless, once you've become accustomed to having it, you want it ALL the time. It has come to a point now where I almost feel lost without it.  One more GL point and I won't have to worry about that anymore!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Torrk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I thought spell awareness, offensive enhancement, health enhancement, and the health regen one were all nice to have.  Really wish a mana regen one existed.<br />
<br />
Could care less about the targetting ones, they just seem redundant to my hotkey group says.  A little more graphical, but not enough to be worth the points.<br />
<br />
I was pissed about the one that shows you the mobs health above their head.  I expected it to show me the % health for &quot;all&quot; mobs, but instead it only does the one you have targetted.  My UI, and pretty much everyone elses under the sun, does that in the target window already.  Was a waste of points I wish I had back.  If it were to show every mobs % even when not targetted, that could have been useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Aurthur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">The unspoken thing about HoTT is that it also lets you know when the heal is late on the MT or whatever...so you can pop a life-saving /SHIELD or work to taunt something off.<br />
<br />
I have almost all the group leader AA's done...just working on finishing up the mana one and the 2nd-3rd levels of Mark NPC.  The junk ones now are really 'Inspect Buffs'...I mean, it *has* uses...but now with self-buff timers being so easy, it's wasted.  Since the group and raid HP ones stack, those are bonus, as well....go go +200hp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Varalla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I got spell awareness so that casters could tell what each other was casting.<br />
It had no use for me untill I found that some free loading casters dont do a whole lot and spend a lot of time AFK.<br />
<br />
When they can see that everyone knows what their casting or in this case, NOT casting, they seem to do a whole lot more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I have most of the good leadership aas: HoTT, spell awareness, health 3, DMA, a few levels in attack.  Other than HoTT and spell awareness I wouldnt work on any of them instead of leveling up or working on regular AA stuff, but once you have finished off all your aa they are pretty nice.  I mean the attack and hp ones stack with regular hp AAs and there are no pure +attack aas for warriors so might as well get them.  The only bad part is that I notice that most groups have multiple people with a ton of leadership aas, so my aas are wasted if I am not actualy leading the group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Callon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">ugh... Raid Leader AA takes forever to get.  Someday I'll have enough points in it to actually buy something useful.  So here's a question, if you're getting 1 raid leader AA ability, what do you save up for first?  A brutal 9 pts for HoTT?  Health enhancement?  (&lt;3 hit points), Spell Awareness?  Something else?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Bulbog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Health 3 or atk3-5 probably but this is just assuming that every group leader has group HoTT which hopefully they do(first group leader aa to get really)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">For raid leadership, I'd go for the abilities that are additive, rather than redundant.  Hit points and offense are logical choices.  The payoff from those points is huge when you have up to 72 people affected.  On the other hand, HOTT and Spell Awareness are totally redundant with the group ability, so why spend raid points on them?  HOTT is probably possessed by every group already, especially if your guild is semi-intelligent and assigns the same group leaders for every raid.<br />
<br />
My question was specifically aimed at group leadership.  Thanks for the suggestions, everyone.  I think I'll go for Spell Awareness now, and prioritize the other ones later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Hinterdir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">First important Raid Skill is Delegate Raid MA</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Dwavlin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">May not be the right thread: please move appropriately, but I am a noob to leadership skills, and have questions on how they work:<br />
<br />
If you are not group leader, can your leadership skills still work in group?  My group has people with various leadership abilities, but no one has &quot;Find Path To PC&quot;.  I have 4 points saved, and since others in my group have HoTT, Mark NPC, etc., but no one has Find path, I was thinking of getting that one.  But I might rather save more for HoTT or Mark _IF_ skills are useless when I am not leader.<br />
<br />
Even if I cannot use LD skills unless I am leader of my group, in a pinch I can ask for /makeleader, but it would be good not to have to.  Find Path seems to me the only skill which a person who is not typically the leader might want to get.<br />
<br />
Also, in a raid situation: there are different Raidleader skills... so is the Leadership ability only applicable to your immediate group, even in a raid situation?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Pag0</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">If you are not group Leader, your skills will not take effect.  In a raid, the skills your group leader has will Only effect your group, while the Raid Leader skills your raidleader has will effect your entire raid</div></div><hr />
