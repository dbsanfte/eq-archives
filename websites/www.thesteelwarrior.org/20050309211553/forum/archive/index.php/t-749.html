First they take away warrior only crits, now they want crips eh.<br />
Sure, how about we give up all of our originallity.  Why should we have anything special?  How about you give me FD for taking my melee crits?  Because we have aggressive and flurry we shouldn't be unhappy about this (as one monk said)?  Right.... I consider flurry what we were given since they gave out crits.  And aggressive.... monks also have a damage taking avoidance discipline, so they have no right to be unhappy about others getting fd like skill right?  Guess how often warriors get to use discs like that?  Unless we're like 9th tank down the line, we don't use any disc for fear of not having evasive / def.<br />
<br />
Now lets give defensive to pallys and sks, and berserker fury to all melees, then just delete the warrior class, since theres nothing special left.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Resets it, and you get the euipment back.... What I have to wonder is if you kill yourself multiple times after doing /testbuff, and then do a /testbuff again, can you get multiple rezzes and actually go over level 25 from that? <br />
<br />
Was just thinking about that. Don't know any Clerics on Test with epic (all that casting would take awhile).<br />
<br />
Wouldn't it be then possible to suicide a few hundred times, and ding 30 or so on the rezzes? If this is possible of course. If you did it a few thousand times real quick... (after suiciding down to say level 11 or so) could you ding 50? Whoa! Mind boggling really, if it works LOL.</div></div><hr />

/tis okay tho on the gnome corpse; 'nomer corpses are so small it's like playing gnome_golf; just keep 'em on the fairway and you can get 18 holes out of 'em easily..hook 'em into the out_of_bounds area and you're skrewed.<br />

That would be a cool as hell GM event, GNOME GOLF..set up 18 holes across the Karanas; and the 19th hole at KFC in South Karana.</div></div><hr />

Why do monks want flurry and crip? The answer is more along the lines of greed then any form of need. A warrior with that has flurry (and his natural crips) is going to do less dmg then a monk of same level with weapons on same scale. The warrior needs to have really damn good weapons to hope to outdmg a average monk. <br />
<br />
Its all a matter of wanting what we don't have. Right now I wanta steak. When I get that steak im gonna want another one. I eat a lot... The monks want our flurry and our crips. When they get them they are gonna say, well warrior abilities actually do suck so give us something else.....<br />

Actually, in regards to that topic I really don't have much of an opinion.<br />
<br />
The monk in me wants DPS increasing AAs for the class.<br />
<br />
But I wanted martial arts related AAs. You know, MONK-LIKE AAs.<br />
<br />
I mean, damn, I'm supposed to be a martial arts master, not some magic pajama wearing foof playing dead in a corner. <br />
<br />
The warrior in me is very VERY happy with the warrior AA abilities that are available.<br />
<br />
No wussy nonsense like Acrobatics, and Purify Body.<br />
<br />
Just hardcore stuff like Flurry and Rampage and Tactical Mastery.<br />
<br />
Good stuff.<br />
<br />
My level 52 warrior is probably going to out AA my monk, as a result.<br />
<br />
Heh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, it's not greed. Monks are in the same position warriors are. Underpowered when compared to the mana using classes, they're just throwing around any ideas they can to help level the playing field.<br />
<br />
All of the pure melee are frustrated right now.  I've seen enough message threads on this board to know that y'all are familiar with the issue. There's no need to beat up on the monks. After all, they're also in there next to you getting torn to pieces at close range.<br />
<br />
For what it's worth my suggestions for improvement include a major intrinsic mitigation/avoidance enhancement for ALL the melee classes to offset the &quot;damage at a distance&quot; tactic common to casters. Intrinsic improvement to melee DPS and missile damage would also help. I don't favor fixes that dilute the uniqueness of the warrior class. After all, I play one too.<br />
<br />
Bitter 'Us vs. Them' thinking makes both groups weaker. It's more effective to work together to make a solution that benefits both.</div></div><hr />

If that's supposed to elicit a knee-jerk reaction from monks, perhaps you posted that on the wrong board.<br />
<br />
If that's just you venting, I think you're venting at the wrong things. <br />
<br />
Other than that I can't figure out what the heck you're getting at.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have had it with the crying from Monks.&quot;<br />
<br />
Where? HERE? Monks don't cry here. They gripe on their own message board. So, if you don't want to read about monks whining, don't READ THEIR FREAKIN MESSAGE BOARD!<br />
<br />
STFU indeed.<br />
<br />
&quot;You want to make your class more balanced cool then don't look over at us and say we want what they got.&quot;<br />
<br />
/sigh<br />
<br />
Monks want DPS increases. Why?<br />
<br />
They've been pigeon-holed into thinking that that's what they are all about.<br />
<br />
And why would a monk think that?<br />
<br />
Could it be they've been told repeatedly that they're NOT MEANT TO TANK?<br />
<br />
If they're not meant to tank, then, they're meant for DPS.<br />
<br />
If DPS is what they're all about, then their AAs should REFLECT THAT and allow them to improve their DPS.<br />
<br />
INSTEAD, Monk AAs are for the large part DEFENSE oriented. While warriors get a nice series of DPS increasing AAs. Which in Luclin, closed the gap between the two classes and made them both more like each other.<br />
<br />
That obviously didn't sit well with people. And things were changed.<br />
<br />
But, point blank, the monk class is a martial arts, hand to hand COMBAT ORIENTED MELEE CLASS.<br />
<br />
Most monks just want to be able to do more damage, and wouldn't mind having some AAs to work towards those kinds of improvements.<br />
<br />
Technique of Master Wu is a great AA, because it's within the spirit of the class and is on target for what the class is supposedly designed to be.<br />
<br />
Physical Enhacement? WTF is that all about?<br />
<br />
&quot;Get one original idea in your heads and run with it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Monks have TONS of original ideas. <br />
<br />
&quot;Leave our class alone we are not in great shape and no we are not happy about it. You want all of our disciplines cool take em but give us yours too. Go back to your boards and sob about how unfair SOE has been to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Monks don't want warrior DISCS.<br />
<br />
They want some AAs, LIKE Flurry.<br />
<br />
Cripling blows aren't a discipline. They're an innate warrior ability.<br />
<br />
I think giving monks crips is stupid.<br />
<br />
I think giving monks an EQUIVALENT to Flurry isn't that bad an idea.<br />
<br />
It's 18 more levels you can force people to grind for some extra eye candy. Why that pisses you off is beyond me. <br />
<br />
The go back to you boards comment is ludicrous. This thread IS ON THE MONK BOARDS. It was linked to here.<br />

If they're still out of whack regardless of the number of AAXP either of the two being compared have, then the fix isn't really something that should come from AAXP should it?<br />
<br />
Pure melee, Warriors, Monks, Rogues, have fallen behind in PoP because they really received no more than very marginal improvements based solely on leveling.  Other classes received similar improvements based solely on leveling and also received more spells in addition.  Leveling improvements + spell additions &gt; leveling improvements alone.  The pure melee need/needed something more.  What we got was bubkas.<br />
<br />
AAXP shouldn't be the fix for this.  Items shouldn't be the fix for this.  Neither of these really address the imbalance.  All they do is allow those who can gain the AAXP or gain the items to level the playing field.  Everyone who can't gain nothing.  What we need are innate class abilities and/or skill improvements.  It's doubtful we'll get them though because I don't really think SOE understands the problem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
AAXP shouldn't be the fix for this. Items shouldn't be the fix for this. Neither of these really address the imbalance. All they do is allow those who can gain the AAXP or gain the items to level the playing field. Everyone who can't gain nothing. What we need are innate class abilities and/or skill improvements. It's doubtful we'll get them though because I don't really think SOE understands the problem. <br />
<br />
Exactly. Not just for one, but for ALL of the pure melee classes. Everyone of us would benefit from that solution. <br />

Like I said in my last post read the post directly in front of mine and see who I am replying to. I can tell you this. If he did not want me to reply to him in this thread then don't post on this thread.  If you don't want anyone to post anything that you don't like or agree with then don't read any posts. I am upset about this issue because Monks fail to understand that they are not the only class in EQ. I am sick of monks and I personally do not care if you like it or not. I took my response to the monk that came here and posted. You want exactly what you want Wubao and if anyone disagrees with you look out. You act like you are the only one that knows anything about the situation. Go cry with your monks because you can't cast DD spells and wear full plate armor and cast complete heal on yourself. I don't need to like that monks in general have no clue about anything other than seeing what Warriors have and saying we want that too and we are not willing to give up anything in return.<br />

I will not be posting to this thread anymore much less reading it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Pfft~<br />
<br />
<br />
Back in my day, the rants were three times rantier!<br />
<br />
<br />
THREE TIMES!!1! <br />
<br />
<br />
Rants nowadays are not even close to what a rant back in the day was worth.<br />
<br />
The trolls were actually good at their job too, none of this stuff they are trying to pull today, spouting &quot;lame&quot;and &quot;STFU F@G!!!&quot; a billion times. They used words that would make Webster look in a book, with baby jeabus would be crying all the time!<br />
<br />
And pictures! There were pictures! And they good! With witty remarks, and cute animals and strange people! Last picture I saw was during the crappiest jihad ever, and that was just some stupid elephant thing.<br />
<br />
Back then people had personalities too, they weren't just another face in the crowd taking pot shots at others whenever they felt like and oozing back into the nameless masses! People had their own stile, their own special way of flaming someone that made it feel worthwhile to read their posts. Hell people even rped their rants, that was the best!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Ah back in the day, when rants were good..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because you're talking trash, with absolutely nothing to back it up.<br />
<br />
Point Blank: I don't give two craps about monk AAs.<br />
<br />
I don't think monks should get CRIPS.<br />
<br />
I don't think monks should get FLURRY.<br />
<br />
I don't think monks should get WARRIOR AAs.<br />
<br />
Here's what I posted in THIS thread about it:<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually, in regards to that topic I really don't have much of an opinion.<br />
<br />
The monk in me wants DPS increasing AAs for the class.<br />
<br />
But I wanted martial arts related AAs. You know, MONK-LIKE AAs.<br />
<br />
I mean, damn, I'm supposed to be a martial arts master, not some magic pajama wearing foof playing dead in a corner. <br />
<br />
The warrior in me is very VERY happy with the warrior AA abilities that are available.<br />
<br />
No wussy nonsense like Acrobatics, and Purify Body.<br />
<br />
Just hardcore stuff like Flurry and Rampage and Tactical Mastery.<br />
<br />
Good stuff.<br />
<br />
My level 52 warrior is probably going to out AA my monk, as a result.<br />
<br />
Heh.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Where's the crying? Where's the whining?<br />
<br />
I thought to myself, hey, I LIKE some warrior AAs.<br />
<br />
So what'd I do?<br />
<br />
I MADE A WARRIOR. I play a warrior. I AA with my warrior. So eventually, I'll GET FLURRY. And be happy.<br />
<br />
You've got some problem with monkly business the message board, and the monk community. Fine.<br />
<br />
TAKE IT TO THEM and fight them there.<br />
<br />
Instead you come here, cry in your beer, and then attack me, on a subject I ACTUALLY AGREE WITH YOU ON.<br />
<br />
I just think you're being stupid and lashing out a PHANTOM MONKS that don't exist.<br />
<br />
You want to argue with monks for wanting warrior AAs, go argue with the monks on that thread.<br />
<br />
You want to bash a monk that actually AGREES with you and thinks monks should have their OWN AAs and warriors should have THEIR OWN AAs ... well I'm right here, trying to grab a pretzel before Varaho sees me.<br />

WHAT IN THE HELL ARE THEY THINKING, The Bo Has a 150 DD on it. It has a neg 300 to fire resit Blade of war adds 700 points of AGGRO. <br />
WTF are those dumb twits even trying to compare? <br />
They swing faster then us with these weapons, They can break haste cap already. I mean my god what more do they want to leach away from us?<br />
What next? Warriors can use defensive so we should have it to?<br />
I just cant believe I read they want cripling blow and they want flurry.. &gt;&lt; Like flurry will add that much more dps .. There is a simple reason they dont need it. <br />
Basic aggro control. Most monks have no idea how to do so. I can barely hold aggro with dual wield 13/17 weapon mainhand agaisnt a monk using a tranq staff and epic.  He just does too much damage and generates too much aggro. <br />
If he had flurry I would never ever be able to pull a mob off him unless he was constintly FDin. <br />
So why in any name of whatever those brain dead coke snorting idioits want more aggro generation if most of them dont even know how to control what they got now?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">05-23-2003, 08:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">heh I even went and posted on the monky boards too; and posted here that monks are silly.....but let me rephrase that a little.<br />
<br />
People suck. Actually, people who know so little about their surroundings that their view through rose-colored glasses only see themselves as the sole reason things should be changed while using randomly inserted scenarios to justify themselves. Hell; along those lines i'd be as bold to say &quot;i want complete heal&quot;; i want &quot;slay undead&quot;, i want &quot;mend&quot;, i want &quot;endless quiver&quot;, i want &quot;rogue DPS&quot;, i want i want i want..<br />
<br />
bleh. what the hell do i know about the others. i'm a warrior. I just want to work dammit. I want to be able to join a group and actually be &quot;worth having&quot; and prvide a needed role/job to add to the group dynamics and log off and feel that that when i leave that group for the eve the group would want another warrior who could/can do my job and help spread this new found logic to others changing their mindet that &quot;warriors are nothing but 3 minute raid scenario miracles&quot;.<br />
<br />
i don't think that's much to ask for. doubt it though since (as mentioned here many times ); AA's, items, etc aren't going to solve it. it's like sticking your finger in the hole in the dam while the water continues to flow out around it. an entire revamp of the warrior class would help it LOTS and some of the ideas here on this board and on the old EZ Board would be a great start.<br />
<br />
1. revise the damage absorbtion tables. as in monks and rogues have their own Offensive DPS tables; warriors should have their own Defensive tables. Damage absorbtion should be along the lines of easive for the average warrior...not for the 100+ AA warrior. <br />
<br />
2. get rid of all the all/all items what make warriors cream their jeans yet MAKE AWESOME ITEMS FOR UTILITY FOR HYBRIDS. Sorry, you f**ked up VI. it's a 13 on 1 arguement there ( warrs vs. EVERYONE ELSE )...we NEED more warr only weapons/items that ACTUALLY BENEFIT US. We got Pal/SK items dropping like candy from LUCLIN on up yet the warr only weapons you can count on ONE HAND. <br />
<br />
3. make the discipine timers ALL less than a 10 minute refresh time. Gawd, I don't need to explain that one any further. It's a no brainer. who's brilliant idea was it to have a 55 minute refresh time on a discipline that lasts 12 seconds? NOT LIKE IT'S WORTH USING ANYHOW BUT TO WAKE SOME PEOPLE UP AND SAY OH SHIT WE HAVE A WARRIOR IN OUR GROUP BUT WHY DID HE WASTE A DISC OMG OMG FFS!<br />
<br />
But this is a monk h8 thread. Do I hate monks? Naaah, some are really cool. But; as in Warriors and any class in EQ; it's the BRAINLESS IDIOTIC MORONS WHO DECIDE THAT THEIR PROVERBIAL PHALLIC REPRESENTATION OF THEIR MATERIAL WORTH HAS TO BE BIGGER THAN EVERYONE ELSES AND HAVE ALL THE OTHERS HOPPING ON IT LIKE FLIES ON SH*T.</div></div><hr />

(Well unless  get a bard but I think that applies to you as well.) <br />
<br />
I agree Flurry should not go to monks. <br />
<br />
I agree Crips should not go to monks. <br />
<br />
You all make a big deal about the different damage table. I'd give them to you. (Anyone that's 65 with a facesmasher care to parse your max hit non Crit/Crip? My guess you hit for 329 I hit for 331)They are nothing. BTW Rogues are on the same damage table that Warriors are.<br />
<br />
I personally liked an idea I heard a while back. Every level post 60 all the pure melee get +20 attack (Innate) They could instead allow our skill caps to rise but I suspect that won't happen. So the raw attack replace the skill ups we SHOULD get. This also  shouldn't apply to the worn atk cap of 250. <br />

<br />
I do take exception to them trying to classify themselves as pure DPS.  Aren't monks supposed to be the premiere pullers?  Not just DPS?  Don't they already have triple attack?<br />
<br />
What it all boils down to is the fact that ALL melee classes need a boost.  That includes rogues, monks and us warriors where going from 60-65 nets us a whole hell of a lot LESS than casters and hybrids.<br />

Oh and yes before you ask, I do have a 55 monk twink alt~</div></div><hr />

   As to the pullers they say Shadowknights and bards make better pullers then them now. They feel just as useless as us about most things. They are looking to try to find a way to get better and as much as there asking for our stuff it is just an idea. <br />
   <br />
As to my idea if you all hate defensive that much and if it is a class breaking discipline then petition to have it removed. Yeah i said removed maybe if we didnt have defensive they would look at us and actually do something.<br />
<br />
 Oh well I'm really just rambiling here so I'll end with this. Drink some beer and screw the monks let them sit and whine im going to try to get 55 now.</div></div><hr />

Best post of the whole thread, thank you.<br />
Not every monk out there is &quot;out to get you, and your fancy aa's too&quot;.<br />
<br />
They ruined FD pulling, made it simply unnecessary in many zones... bards, clerics, enchanters can in most cases pull easier, with less risk. and most certainly in PoP xp zones you don't even need an FD puller.<br />
<br />
So all that's left to monks, is damage, and survivability (mend/stonestance) if they get beat on.<br />
Concerning damage, well, there's wizard, rogue, bst, mage, necro, druid, and probably a few more, ahead of monks. you don't need a monk in a group or on a raid.<br />
<br />
That's the problem we have at the moment, plain and simple.<br />
Sure the monks do the pulling on raids in my guild.<br />
But it's not needed. we do it out of habit.<br />
<br />
I'm looking forward to that dungeon expansion, hope there'll be stuff to FD split pull.<br />
<br />
And yes, warriors need fixed. That doesn't mean that monks don't need it as well though.<br />
<br />
Please don't hate the class as a whole, we're not all whiny greedy little bitches. ;)</div></div><hr />
