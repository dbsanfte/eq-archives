<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">10-07-2003, 12:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Conclusion - Since Paladins always have at a minimum their self-buffs, the actual Warrior HP advantage over a simularly equipped Paladin is either very modest or non-existant in most groups.<br />
<br />
In order to have even a very modest HP advantage, Warriors must purchase Virtue and Brells before grouping (and not die) or only join groups containing a Cleric and a Paladin.<br />
<br />
In ALL other cases (think LDoN pickup groups) a Warrior HP advantage does not for all practical purposes exit.<br />
<br />
I was reading a thread on another board when suddenly it occured to me....<br />
<br />
What happens to the Warrior/Paladin HP gap as a result of Paladin buffs? (This is not going to be a perfect analysis since I'm tired and don't feel like taking into account Strength of Tunare).<br />
<br />
For purposes of this discussion, let's assume a simularly equipped Warrior and Paladin with the Warrior having an 800 HP advantage.<br />
<br />
When grouping with a Cleric, a Warrior has a 450 HP advantage over a Paladin grouped with a Cleric if and only if the Warrior has BSS (and I've never heard BSS buffing advertised or being asked for in /ooc in PoK) or has a Paladin in his group [800 HP - Aura of the Crusader (350 HP Paladin self buff)].<br />
<br />
If a Warrior is in a group with a Paladin then the Warrior HP advantage is 450 HP's [(800 HP - Aura of the Crusader (350 HP Paladin self buff)].<br />
<br />
-- Edited to make clearer --<br />
<br />
- When a Warrior is grouped with a Druid of a Shaman and does not have Virtue or BSS he has a HP disadvanrave compared to a Paladin in the same group<br />
<br />
In a group with a Druid as the main healer, no Paladin or Cleric and the Warrior not having Paladin or Cleric buffs -<br />
<br />
The Warrior gets 743 HP's [Po9 (618) and maybe Strength of Tunare (125)]<br />
<br />
A Paladin gets  1805 HP's [Heroism (425), Symbol of Marzin (700), Brell's Stalwart Shield (330), Aura of the Crusader (350)]<br />
<br />
Making the Warrior HP (dis)advantage -232 HP's (800-1032)<br />
<br />
When a Shaman is the main healer, the results are simular.<br />
<br />
Even if the Warrior has Virtue or is grouped with a Cleric, he has a maximum 450 HP advantage and only a 120 HP advantage if he's not buffed with BSS vs a Paladin buffed with Virtue, etc.<br />
<br />
In order to maintain even a paltry 450 HP advantage over a simularly equipped Paladin - <br />
<br />
A Warrior must either group with a Paladin or purchase Virtue (if a Cleric is not in the group) and BSS before joining a group that doesn't contain a Paladin.<br />
<br />
Is my math and logic totally wrong or is the Warrior HP advantage largely non-existant in most groups?<br />

I'm in a Ssra/pre-Elemental PoP level guild.  Our top warrior with full raid buffs has just under 8.6k hp.  Our top paladin with full raid buffs has about 8.2k hp.  That would be a difference of under 5% for those keeping score at home.  I'm the #3 warrior in the guild and I have about 100 more hp than our top paladin.  I think the paladin has more ac as well...</div></div><hr />

In most exp groups, you have a cleric and not a druid anyways. So it hardly helps us, does it?<br />
Also, the last time I had Bre.... nm I never had Brells when tanking in an exp group</div></div><hr />

I take sadistic pleasure in making him buff me so that I tank and HE don't. Your point still stands, just not as strongly ;) The hp gap's a lot narrower than most think.</div></div><hr />

They have a druid healer, so do they take the paladin for his agro advantage or the warrior for his HP advantge.... oh, wait :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, it kinda sucks... but it's true. In today's EQ, it's just as valid to say that &quot;situtationally, the paladin has a hitpoints advantage over a warrior&quot;, as saying &quot;situationally, a warrior has a hitpoints advantage over a paladin.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">10-08-2003, 01:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe not as situational as you might think.  I was thinking about this earlier and thought about it.  Boredom struck me, I decided I wanted to see the actual natural hp difference between the two classes.<br />
<br />
I loaded up magelo and created a 65 human warrior and a 65 human paladin.  I gave them matching equipment, including a BoW (even tho I know a paladin wouldn't normally be using it, it's the best weapon I could think of that both could use.  I punched in their respective cultural armor for the armor slots, and the difference in hp was about 750hp.  Okay, not that bad, considering the warrior cultural probably has more hp considering it's Rallos Zek armor.<br />
<br />
Then I wanted to see the differenc using the high end LDoN armor, to see what effect being plate class/all would have.  so I loaded the Royal Attendant armor of Sand into both.  The results were rather...intriguing.<br />
<br />

The Paladin<br />
<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=823951<br />
The Warrior<br />
<br />
I used BoW and solstice earring for purely keeping their equipment identical...the dream profile for the warrior has a couple equipment different.  I emphasized stamina equipment, as that's partly(or mostly) where the hp difference lies.  I realize most of this equipment isn't going to be normal for a warrior/paladin, but realize that shortcomings can be made up with augments (this IS LDoN armor, after all).  The paladin only has 143wis, so he'd probably make a couple of decisions differently unless he made up the wis with augments.<br />
<br />
With identical armor, and 241sta (equal starting stamina too)...unbuffed, there's only a 470hp difference.  Changing the FT1 earring it becomes 500hp.  Sure, with stamina buffs or slightly better stamina differences it might be as high as 550 or even 600, or even slightly higher with Natural Durability.<br />
<br />
Considering the 64 buff is 350hp, and BSS is 330hp, and the paladin statement that they're never invited unless they're tank (taken to mean a lack of a warrior in group), it'd be very hard to find a place where a warrior did indeed have more hp than a paladin if they had equal equipment.  I know ornate probably gives more, and I'll work out the ornate difference later, but since LdoN points are so easy to farm at 65, I'd be surprised if either the warrior or the paladin did not have at least LDoN equipment.<br />
<br />
The only &quot;provided&quot; requirements to this I can see if that it requires the paladin to have all their spells (mainly the 64 self buff and the 65 hybrid buff) and it requires both people to have the Royal Attendant equipment.  This is intended for the casual gamer, the people who do not have the time to go raiding for elemental access/gear all week.  The people who use more bazaar-bought equipment.<br />
<br />
Not a pretty picture.  I realize that warriors and paladins might do the non-visible gear differently, but I wanted to see how big the hp difference was when the gear equation was taken as much out of the equation as possible.<br />
<br />
Any comments or suggestions?</div></div><hr />

<br />
ONLY taking into account Pally buffs that stack with nearly everything else, and that warriors will rarely have due to the tank stackability issue, I HAVE no hitpoint advantage over the pally.<br />
<br />
In fact in groups with either a shaman or a druid main healer, the pally would have more hitpoints as a tank in the group, than the warrior were were he to be the tank for that group.<br />
<br />
IN groups with clerics, the hitpoints would be almost exactly the same.<br />
<br />
ONLY in groups with a paladin, OR on raids, does the warrior maintain any kind of hitpoint advantage over the paladin.<br />
<br />
When you consider that there USED to be a 20% difference back when there was balance, I think that's a big problem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
level 53 pre-Kael -- class armor mixed<br />
level 60 pre-Pop -- class, Kael, Seru, Emp, VT, LDoN armor mixed<br />
level 65 pre- Planar -- class, LDoD, VT, Ornate, Planar armor mixed<br />
level 65 pre - PoTime -- Ornate, Planar armor mixed<br />
level 65 PoTime<br />
<br />
But this is really kind of an idle excercise. Class armor is seldom the best armor available at any level. Since most of the best WAR, PAL, SHA amor has Int, Wis, and mana no real trade-offs are necessary.<br />
<br />
Knights see themselves as tanks and their equipment selection reflects this.<br />
<br />
My point in making this thread is to show that any Warrior HP advantage is very iffy at best and as someone else said &quot;situational&quot;.<br />
<br />
When I hit 10K HP's and am weilding a BoW with a Force of YKesha augment I really won't much care. 5% of all Warriors  may reach the point where their non-existant advantages and superior Knight aggo (posessed by 95% of all Knights) don't matter. Doesn't sound like fun to me.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Boleslav</div><div class="date">10-08-2003, 02:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why is this in The Outhouse?  It belongs in The War Room.  This is a fact-based, mostly civil discussion of an issue.  <br />
<br />
We can argue about the specific number of HP that a Warrior has more than a Paladin in every situation but that goes beyond the point.  The point that is well made, and well taken by this Paladin, is that under most circumstances, the gap in HP between a Warrior and Paladin is insignificant, and even fully raid buffed the difference is closer to 5% than 10%.  The general consensus previously would have been that Warriors had a bigger advantage than that.<br />
<br />
What is an acceptable difference between a raid buffed Warrior and Paladin in comparable gear?  The next question, of course, is what is logical to do to achieve that level.  If you nerf Paladin HP, you probably need to hit other Hybrids, Monks, Rogues, and Shaman too because the gaps from Knights downward are small as well.  While I agree that fully buffed, a Warrior should have significantly more HP than a Paladin, I also think that the Paladin should have more HP than a Ranger for example.<br />

<br />
Yeah, looks like war got the brells, so you subtract the SoT and add in brells 330-125= 205.  so the disadvantage goes down to just 27hp.  Then you add in the fact the paladin would add in symbol (also not listed on war example)  + 700hp, and you end up with war at hp advantage of 673,  so yeah....  war still came behind....  but that's when grouped with a paladin, I re-read and realised he was saying without a cleric/paladin in group.</div></div><hr />
