<br />
This is my current set up, http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=357599&amp;alt=0.<br />
As you can see...I have an RBG for haste.  My guild can easily dispose of most of NToV, Xanamech, Doomshade, Yelinak, Lendi, TMax, Dain, Tunare, Cazic Thule...I want 41% haste.  I can't decide to go for some GoDS, Earing of Endless Speed (really don't want this one..), or Woven Shim Choker.  Either way, I plan on changing my neck, waist, gloves, and back items.  Out of the mobs listed, what would be the best set up?  I am active as hell (98% raid), and have the 4th highest DKP in my guild.  <br />
<br />
If you click on my &quot;Realistic Dream&quot; profile, you can see the set up that I would like...I am just curious if out of those mobs, would that be my best decision?  Thank ya in advance~</div></div><hr />

<br />
Neck = Shaderock Amulet.<br />
Gloves = Gaunt of Drag. Slayage<br />
Belt = Dorf Slayage, or Tunare Belt<br />
Back = Cloak of Thorns, or Cloak of Fearsome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tima</div><div class="date">06-13-2003, 02:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gauntlets of Dragonslaying have nice ac, hps and stats and if you dont plan to upgrade gloves anytime soon, they would be what i would lean toward. Your realistic profile looks good, toss the GoDS on instead of the Gaunts of Stability (only a 5ac loss but same hps) and you leave the neckslot open for a Shaderock Amulet or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Braeorn</div><div class="date">06-13-2003, 02:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd go with either the destroyer belt or shim choker for haste. Personally I have destroyer belt, with plans to get neck from CT. If you go choker, rubi belt is good waist item thats 1 groupable (I think).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krauth Isuber</div><div class="date">06-13-2003, 03:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's a lil' problem...Since I am the 2nd tank of the guild (Normally the MT...the true MT is NEVER on), factioning is a bit dificult for me, (trying to get more than one velious faction up at a time).  I am currently max-KoS to just about ALL major Velious factions (Kromzek, CoV, Yeli, Dain, Thurg, TMax).<br />
<br />
I was messing around with my magelo, and I kinda like Smakz idea...I *think* I may go for that.  I really wanna break the 8k club buffed, and I think that just may do it.  But, I kinda have this odd fetish for the Woven Shim Choker (not exactly why...but....imo, it's just so damn seksi =P</div></div><hr />
