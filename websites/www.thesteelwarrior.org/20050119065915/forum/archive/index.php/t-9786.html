<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dags</div><div class="date">11-18-2004, 02:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Currently I use a Blade of Carnage primary with a anger 3 and Epic 1.5 with dual anger 3.<br />
<br />
We are farming Time one day a week but Dbotw have been hiding.<br />
<br />
I have a VDD unaugmented that I just got and it seems to hold good agro.<br />
<br />
We farm Ikkinz 1-4, but my question is this.  Until a Dbotw drops should I.<br />
<br />
1.  Keep the weapon setup I am using<br />
<br />
2.  Get a JoS or EoE and use them with the Epic 1.5.<br />
<br />
3.  Anger 3 the VDD and use it until a Dbotw drops.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">oomwarrior</div><div class="date">11-19-2004, 09:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would think primary epic 1.5 primary and BoC off hand would generate better aggro then the way you have it.  BoC doesnt have a proc aug so it's not going to be better aggro considering the ratio on the epic is not even in the same state as far as dps compared to BoC.  I know alot of you say dps has no aggro compared to proc, but the truth is it's all part of the equation and I think you will see an improvement in aggro if you just main hand the epic</div></div><hr />

Pick up a JoS or EoE if they are cheap/rotting but they are gonna go in the bank when you get your Darkblade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">11-19-2004, 12:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you are in good dkp standing save your points for a DBoTWL ... maybe pick up a rotting EoE or JoS to tide you over till it drops.  If i was you i'd stick with my current combo till one of the afformentioned happens.<br />
<br />
If you're 4th-8th in line for a DBoTWL then i'd go for the first high aggro 1hander that comes your way.  FB ... BBoB ... DB ... JoS ... EoE ...<br />
<br />
It's worth the wait (so they tell me).</div></div><hr />
