Who thinks this is fake entirely? And who thinks this is a moron, making so many claims, such as:<br />
<br />
Gloves of Airy Mists<br />
Amazing gloves from phase IV in the plane of time, never turn off attack during enrage again with the amazing ability of STRIKETHROUGH.<br />
<br />
<br />
Face Slot: Faceguard of Frenzy<br />
AC: 100<br />
Slot 1, type 8: AUGMENTED additional 40AC from GOD Expansion <br />
<br />
<br />
Neck Slot: Collar of Catastrophe<br />
Shielding is one of the most uber abilities that any item can have for a warrior in the end game you’ll love this as you MA for your entire guild. Only gotten from the Plane of Time phase IV. <br />
<br />
<br />
You will be the MA in 98% of all guilds in the game and in the top five of even the the most uber guilds.<br />
<br />
<br />
And who thinks this is all of the above?<br />
<br />
What combination of these do you think fits for this person?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>bargran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">A nice thing i noted :<br />
<br />
Helm : Raex’s Helm of Destruction<br />
Slot 1, type 7: Solid Coal of Prowess ADDITIONAL 40 hp!! <br />
...<br />
Raex's Greaves of Destruction<br />
The character needs only 2 hard or 4 easy Ruj Ldon adventures to open up the 40 hp augs available for this slot. <br />
<br />
i would like to know how he can buy an augment for his helm, when he needs some advs to unlock the SAME augment for his legs..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>turkishbull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What server is this guy supposedly on?  I didnt see where it was listed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sounds like someone trying to hype their merchandise so they can pawn it off on some ignorant unsuspecting chump with more dollars than sense.  How much would you pay for it now?!  But wait, there's more!   We'll even throw in this incredibly useless item that costs us only pennies to manufacture so we can jack up the price on our other useless merchandise and make you think you're getting a deal!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>FulorianC</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Heh, thats mostly what sales is about. Theres another auction on the front page of PA right now thats the epitome of that. http://www.playerauctions.com/listings/details/index.cfm?itemnum=1084229439 - not going  to condone an illegal program, but your essentially paying 200 bucks for something that takes 20 minutes to install. And my my my, they are getting bold. FRONT PAGE of PA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i think it ranks right up there with them Mustang Shelby replicars that's &quot;one time only!! rare!! cheap!! must sell!!&quot; that's really a plain jane with some tags from JC Whitney.<br />

Buyer Beware. But can't really call him a moron if someone buys it :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
 thats enough bs to call this fake..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>FulorianC</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thats the very first thing that tipped me off.. but.. it just keeps piling on as you read into it further. But theres enough detail to convince me its a real fairly high end War... Its just not 'perfect' in any way. If I finished my Sturd I'd have the same hp and more AC than he admits to, so despite some of the good gear mentioned, obviously theres some less than perfect stuff in the other slots not being admitted to.<br />
<br />
But some things just don't fit. I can understand misplacing the phases on drops, sure. But 40 AC GoD augment? No chance. 10% Strikethrough = no more damage on enrage? Now thats serious crack smoking there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It's probably a person going through a third party to sell the account, rather than the person themselves.</div></div><hr />

Yeah. I'm sure HNE, FoH *RIP*, AL *RIP*, TR, and AO and/or Talisman want an ebayed 12400 hp max buffed warrior. Like I want a hernia.</div></div><hr />

The equipment/AA/Skills listed are pretty much an identical match.<br />
<br />
Server: Morell-Thule <br />
Guild: Fury's Edge<br />
<br />
Maybe this isn't the same person, maybe it is. It's no secret people are fed up and leaving EQ in mass numbers, I'm not surprised to see more like this.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>turkishbull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">If this is real, is it really worth it to spend over 1500 dollars?  I honestly dont think so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Slovack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Real or not, 1500.00 + real American dollars is totally stupid IMO. Comes down to the old saying &quot;some peoples got more money than they know what to do with&quot;. If they got the cash to throw away for some intangible bits of programming more power to them though.<br />
<br />
Other than my monthly fees, and the expansions since i bought EQ Gold. I got a total of 50 bucks in this game. Thats damn plenty for a game.<br />
<br />
If i were to someday sell my account i'd have to ask probably 300 to 500 bucks. Thats gods plenty for the Gold edition i started out with plus the expansions since then.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh i completely understand that, say Bill Gates wanted to play EQ but didnt want to spend the time to level up a toon. Hell, 1500 bucks to him would be like most of us droping a penny under the pop machine and not worrying to fish it out....</div></div><hr />

and I doubt its fake, people get bored, sell their accounts daily I know when I sold my druid I had all intent of quitting, 3 weeks later and realized I wanted to come back. PL'd up my frog in a month to 65~<br />

Whats sad is the idiots that purchase these accounts, know jack shit about the game and go oocing &quot; 65 blah blah lfg in the plane of power _xxxxxxx_ hp unbuffed, _xxxxx_ mana unbuffed, 1203aa's &quot; then they come to your group and use greater heal, revive or dont know what taunt is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And the best legit AC aug in the game is a 35 AC aug, maybe 1 exists gamewide, from the Time level Guk LDoN raid. There are several 30 AC augs, such as one from the Valdoon time level LDoN raid from MM, and the Blessed Shard from the Primal Insect. But there are no 40 AC's discovered as yet. Its a blatant lie.</div></div><hr />
