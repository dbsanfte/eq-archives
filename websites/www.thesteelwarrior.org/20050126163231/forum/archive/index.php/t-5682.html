<br />
It seems odd that bashing through an absorption shield actually generates aggro...<br />
<br />
Or am I missing something totally obvious?<br />
<br />
<br />
I am referring specifically to the SEWS and its proc.</div></div><hr />

Not enough aggro for you to get a mobs attention from a slow or over nuking wizard.  It does cause aggro to all mobs near you.<br />
<br />
Was fighting in Chardok last night without crowd control. Some fights we would have 4 or 5 mobs at once. As long as no others damaged or cast on the adds after a couple procs all the adds would be on me.</div></div><hr />

   Well, it's not exactly that, it's more that when you first proc rune, you're giving yourself an extra 230 hp. After using a BBB for quite some time, I'd have to estimate rune 3 as being approximately 1:1 hate. You'd be better off with a hate proc, but a SEWS is a heck of a sword and will generate decent aggro, especially with anger 3.<br />
<br />
SEWS vs BoW (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?postid=48655#post48655) has some comparisons and opinions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for how much, I can't remember the specifics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kellaen</div><div class="date">02-13-2004, 10:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's not agro like a direct hate item, more a mini area effect agro. That said it still draws fairly decent, added bonus of mitigating a bit of damage too =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">02-13-2004, 12:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Casting runes are basically considered as heals as far as mobs are concerned. Rune III is probably not a whole lot of agro, but it does indeed have an AE type effect because every mob in range thinks you have healed yourself. FYI - the runes that make a mob turn and whack a caster are 800pt+ runes. I can tell you from many poundings that the wizard epic 800pt rune can be suicide if cast at the begining of a fight.</div></div><hr />

Thats one thing I really love about it.  Also, it's useful for soloing =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">turkishbull</div><div class="date">02-15-2004, 03:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">so how does rune 2 compare to agro vs rune 3.....is it like the difference between Enraging Blow and Tuanting blow?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gobsmash</div><div class="date">02-16-2004, 02:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">People say it is area of effect but it is not, it will only add agr on mobs that are agro on you already even if only 1 point and it does not matter where in the zone they are.<br />
<br />
As an example if you take summoning mob get another warrior to tank it while you run to the other side of the zone and then beat on a different mob makeing your rune proc you will eventualy get summoned.</div></div><hr />

I bet fruzuk was agro on the chardok mobs he was tanking :p. Usually mobs are agro on you, just for being in your range, agro is indeed like a heal, which further increases agro on all mobs that are agro on you. Nobody says it agros new agro like a, lets say earthshaker or any other AE harm weapon.</div></div><hr />
