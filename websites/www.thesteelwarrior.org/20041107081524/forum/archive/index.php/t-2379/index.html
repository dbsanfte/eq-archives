<br />
/shrug I don't think he is an idiot just poorly articulated.  I like the concept of the &quot;ratio&quot; but it really is only applicable to soloers though...in any well formed exp group the mob will be slowed and the only part of the equation worth considering is the DPS or dealt portion. /grin man that sounds as discombobulated as his posts!</div></div><hr />

this single line had me really LOL very loudly IRL...<br />
<br />
I think he actually had a creative idea but it got bogged down in his poor writing and inflammatory language <br />
no he had not. as he said, Slow changes how the time runs. which is wrong. I found it very easy to understand that Bracy is an idiot.<br />
<br />
He disagrees with the basic meaning of what &quot;DPS&quot; is, ignoring the fact that this term has been around for years now. That alone flags him absolutly unable to discuss at all. Humans need clear definitions of terms in order to communicate with each other. He failed to understand this.<br />
Some people would be better off illiterate</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Janus_Eci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Hehehe...<br />
<br />
That was incredible.  Bracy's perception of reality is really ... off.  I think my favorite idea in that thread was that casting haste on a melee or kei on a caster ups the shaman/enchanter's DPS and not the recipient.  Gave me quite a chuckle ^_^;;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">*shrug* It's a pretty easy concept.  Haste increases DPS and slow decreases DPS.  Casting slow on a mob will therefore decrease it's DPS while having zero impact on your DPS.  How hard is that to figure out?  Yet Bracy seems to completely miss it and get off into an invalid tangent.  I couldn't even read it all, it just hurts to read someone who misses the point by such a large margin.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Although not consider a &quot;DPS class,&quot; it can be pretty difficult to beat a Shaman in DPS.<br />
<br />
That's absolutely true, but it depends alot on circumstance. To do high DPS, the shaman has to devote most, if not all of his/her spell slots to damage output and really can't do anything else.<br />
<br />
http://www.legacyofages.com/members/ShammyDPS.jpg<br />
<br />
That is without the new dot damage increasing focus effects. That is 221 DPS for those dots. Increase that by an around 10% for focus effect and that's 240-245 DPS. The downside is all the poison counters add alot of aggro. The upside is that a shaman can keep that up pretty much indefinitely assuming they are actually able to sit down to switch in canni and torpor ever once in a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Actually Tug, I borrowed that from an episode of the Simpson's, where Stephen Hawking said that he found Homer's theory of a donut shaped universe intriguing. :)<br />
Comparing this guy to Homer is really an unfair comparison though.  Homer is way more clever.<br />
<br />
EDIT: I noticed that when I've been awake for 30 hours, and at work for 25 hours, I can't spell. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Graal, I wanna see a warrior holding agro vs THAT.. impossible.<br />
Also, as been said, the shaman will not do ANYTHING else. not even to mention that the shamans mana will barely be able to keep up with such a mass DoTTing. Canni and Torpor and all that is not that good, especially since the shaman will be busy casting DoTs most of the time. Also.. its, as you say, 245 dps. Wizards easily beat that, and like Bracy said, shamans &gt;&gt;&gt; wizards in DPS (he has no idea what DPS actually is, but whatever)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>CyrzB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">[Bracey Logic = ON] (That means I'm KIDDING)<br />
<br />
If you read far enough, you see that Bracey beleives that if a group pulls a mob, does 500 damage to it, and wipes, then adds a shaman, the shaman slows, the group does 700 damage before it wipes, then the 200 damage should be credited to the shaman's slow...<br />
<br />
<br />
THEREFORE- If a raid with no tank pulls, says, the Avatar of War, does 3k damage, and wipes, then adds a tank, Pulls AoW, does 500k (or however much hp he has) damage (Cause people aren't dieing at the rate of 1/second, and the healers have someone to heal!) then... 497k of the damage belongs TO THE WARRIOR!!<br />
<br />
<br />
THEREFORE Warriors are the best DPS Class EVAH.<br />
[Bracey Logic = OFF]</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Goska</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">CyrzB, your logic is flawed because your warrior is probably hasted so the extra DPS goes to the haster.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>CyrzB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Fine! Enchanter hastes me for 64% (I'm using 36% item haste, so I hit the cap), meaning I do double the damage that I would with no item or spell haste. So the enchanter adds 32% to my dps, right?<br />
<br />
 I'll split the 32% 50/50 with the enchanter, so 16% of my DPS belongs to the chanter- I can't do that extra DPS w/o the chanter, the chanter can't do it without me.<br />
<br />
So... of the 497k damage I did, 16% is enchanters, 84% is mine! Assuming a 5 miniute AoW fight, little rounding since I don't feel like opening the calcuator... 100k DPM, 84K of which is mine, I'm STILL working out to something like 1,300 damage PER SECOND!<br />
<br />
<br />
WRAA I DARE ANYONE TO CHALLANGE THE WARRIOR FOR DPS KING! I just proved that warriors can do 1300DPS, SUSTAINED! I you don't agree with me, you need hooked on phonics or are a moron, just ask Bracey!<br />
<br />
<br />
Wait wait! It gets BETTER! Assume that during that 5 miniute fight, 3 of those miniutes were probably spent Evasive! Since Evasive cuts your DPS by like 30%, and was on, rounding down, for half the fight, I get a 15% bonus, which brings me up to something like 1,500 DPS w/o Evasive! SUSTAINED!<br />
<br />
Hmmm... with a slower, a cleric, and an enchanter, I could take 8 other warriors... 9 warriors times 1500 is like 13500DPS, plus we'd have the haste to add to our DPS, which adds like 16% (see about) brining us to like 15kdps, plus we'd have slow, Bracey already showed us how slow multiplies DPS by 4!! so we got like 60k DPS! WE CAN TWO GROUP RALLOS WITH 9 WARRIORS, A CLERIC, CHANTER, AND SLOWER!<br />
<br />
/wanders off to find Bracey, some cleric, some chanter, and 8 other warriors, and, for some reason is never heard from again.</div></div><hr />

1+1=cat. because one and the other one when combined becomes a cat because without one cat the other one couldn't have been there doing the 500 damage and keeping the wizard alive getting the enchanters 75% of the gorups credit when the warriors damage shield..OH SHIT I FOG+ROGTO ABOUT THE DAMAGE SHIELD THE DRUID IS TEH WIN.</div></div><hr />

About the Wizard DPS, you're wrong. Most times Wizards DON'T run out of mana, even in very long fights. Also, they NEVER get aggro, there's a nice little spell called concussion to help with that.  <br />

<br />
<br />
&quot;&quot;You can't see the forest for the trees.<br />
<br />
A Shaman doesn't get Dual Wield, Double Attack, or Kick, but what we get is roughly the equivalent of these abilities. It allows us to hit the mob several times before it hits us back.<br />
<br />
Surely you're not really this dense.&quot;&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;&quot;Btw, you're stuck on measuring damage dealt in the course of one second without taking into account that Slow has the effect of slowing *TIME*, in which case one second is no longer equal to one second, but is *stretched* to several seconds.&quot;&quot;</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">good wizards never get agro unless MT dies<br />
<br />
I'm going to have to disagree with you Trondir.  Good Wizards will in fact get aggro from time to  time because they are intentionally pushing the aggro envelope in order to maximize the amount of damage they can do against a particular boss mob.  Of course they're working to avoid aggro at the same time, but all it takes is one small miscalculation and they're getting summoned and taking the beat down.   Since they're human beings and aren't perfect, they'll occassionally slip up.  That doesn't make them bad Wizards, just the opposite, trying to get the most out of their DPS is exactly why they're there to begin with.</div></div><hr />
