I am a 38 war at moment holding level on friends for ldon reasons,having fun.  Looking for a better than decent weapon that is droppable possibly farmable with one group of 65 toons or less. I am willing to spend around 8k-10k or so to get from bazaar. can i get a few decent ideas and please as i am still new to this realm of eq hold on the abreviations please. Have 65 mage i have played for the past year and half  to use as farmer who is pretty much retiring as i like war better. Got the weighty polearm at moment, does alright around 80 damge per hit,from poj basement. looking for 2hb and 2hs so i can work skills on each. will be a little while before i can use GSoT i got while in bot exping the mage. no magelo at moment.</div></div><hr />

<br />
2hb, you'd be better off waiting for GSoT on that one. Not many 2hbs worth getting before then.<br />
<br />
But if you wanna go old school, Mithril Staff. $$$$</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anakun</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 12:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">will look at mithril looks like ratio sucks bad tho. may have to just look for low delay 2hb weapon in bazaar no matter damge and suck up practicing as off tank or those oh so fun wall grind groups in OT and DL.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CedVicious</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 01:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">GreastStaff of Thunder is for require level 55 I think.<br />
<br />
2HS that I (43) war (ab)use?  War Marshal's Bladed Staff.  Check my Magelo, it should be listed.  Delay is ridiculous and you do more dmg as you level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gabriel</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 02:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you want a cheap 2hb to practice with in a group, pick up a shovel.  With haste its ok for practicing.  Or hell since you like the warrior so much, get a truncheon of doom.  While it wont proc yet, no warrior should be without one in his/her bag.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xebokan</div><div class="date">10-10-2003, 09:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would ignore War Marshal's Bladed Staff for now, since it's realy crappy at your levels with the recommended penalties. Go for a Poison Wind Chaser (2hb) for keeping your skill up and perhaps Reaver for 2hs, since it has no recommended or required level and very good ratio.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slycyn</div><div class="date">10-12-2003, 01:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd definitely recommend a REAVER. 40dam 40delay 12 to all saves... I used one till I got a Windblade recently at 54 and was always very happy with it. Also, its pretty cheap, about 5k on TT.<br />
 For 2hb I'd get something cheap with a ok ratio just to keep skill up till GSoT, somethin like a 30dam 40delay sarnak warhammer (or is it battlehammer...) which you can get for about 1-200pp.<br />
<br />
BTW... first post here and I just wanted to say what a great site this is for us Warriors, thank you all for th helpful and informative posts. :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Until you hit your 50s, Reaver is your best bet for a 2hander.<br />
<br />
40/40 is hard to beat at level 38.</div></div><hr />
