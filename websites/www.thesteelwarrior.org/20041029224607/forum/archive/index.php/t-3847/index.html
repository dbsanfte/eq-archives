<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>faederya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Bloodmetal Earring Of Engagement<br />
<br />
How to make it (http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=7329&amp;menustr=035000000000)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mvreena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The BME is not exactly what I would call cheap, especially considering your looking to upgrade a black sapphire electrum earring.  BME's cost about 30K on my server, the highly polished gem goes for about 15-20K alone or you have to be flagged for tactics to even get the drop.  Mosquito leg earring is less pricey, goes for about 11-15K on my server and is a nice upgrade.  Even less is the Earring of the Solstice quest earring.  Can be made for about 5K on my server.<br />
<br />
DISCLAIMER:  Mithaniel Marr's economy is horrible.  One of the oldest servers and stuff still sells for a ton.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brolie Paragus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">your prices are about the same as my servers but at least you dont have earthshakers sellin for 75-100k pp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you are flagged for Tactics, you can also get a Blood Earring of Rage that drops off the Piglet. Highly polished gems drop off the ogres outside of the pit (means you dont have to drop in it hehe), but those ogres are partially slowable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Warram</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">LDoN has some cheap ear upgrades.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't buy them.   Camp the pieces, get 4 or 5 and a 25% chance of failure you'll have two.  Im sure you know a Master JCer .... <br />
<br />
Yes, camp Tactics.  If your not flagged go do the side quest, will take 5 days max and it increases your charm +1.  Go hunt Tactics, its a fun zone really.  Something about killing Ogres makes me all .... /blushes</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Camp 4C in cazic thule and you can easily get a few Lizard Bone Earrings or Lizard Tooth Earrings.  Both are like 70-75 hps 10 stamina with some other stats.  Lots of the loots from 4C still sell rather well too like fleshgrinders and other misc stuff.</div></div><hr />

You could always do a few dungeons and try to get this. Got myself one the other day - it drops off a named in Takish theme, I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Khabok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Tactics access is the 4 diaku emblems off the Diaku in PoS desert area. Good part is once you collect all 4, 4 different types from 4 different classes of Diaku, you can flag a whole group.<br />
<br />
And now that I am nearing the end of my defensive AA path I started looking ahead a while ago and wanted to get an earthshaker. After regularly checking bazaar and never seeing any I found one for sale the other day for 250 plat and quickly ran and grabbed it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">In PoStorms near the desert giant camp (I forget which side, but I think off to the north) there's some rock storms...there's also a hill over there you can stay on.  When you kill the rock storms, it has a chance of spawning a Diaku (really freaking big ogre, for those who haven't been in Tactics).  This could be warrior, shaman, shadowknight...and maybe one other class.  Each class drops a different medallion, you gather all four and give them to a guy in the zone named Wembly and you flag your whole group for Tactics.<br />
<br />
I still need to do this, btw.</div></div><hr />
