The whole zone is just cool, and very well put together imho.</div></div><hr />

Dragons are the things you dream when you are a kid.<br />
And ToV NToV is quite crowded :)<br />

Make you say &quot;ok so this is where the big boys hang out&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">05-16-2003, 11:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sleepers Tomb has to be my favorite.  Great toys that drop, overall fun encounters, interesting look.  Especially the area with the ancients, very nice looking, and the ancients themselves are fun to kill (though the 4th takes a long time with 16 people =\).  Two things that bug me about it though... the doors (one side closes before the other and if you try to open it the other side shuts, so you have to wait with the door half open until both sides close to open it fully again), and the primal 2h axe (it looks like a frosty, not a 2handed weapon).</div></div><hr />

I went there at level 40 while i was hanging with some way higher ups then me and we did about 2 hours of exping it was awesome. First time they poped up one of those dead skellys and it hit me i was like Im gonna die</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smakz</div><div class="date">05-17-2003, 03:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Coolest looking zone, gotta be DN, i LOVE that old decaying lost city look.<br />
<br />
Funnest, im old school on this one, gotta be Befallen.  I never had as much fun in my entire EQ career than the first time i entered Befallen way back pre RoK, with my pally (was my first toon, havent played him in over 3 years), and fell down the well.  That was the shit.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">czai</div><div class="date">05-17-2003, 04:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would have to vote for Unrest.  Nothing beat those days where seeing &quot;A festering hag begins to cast a spell&quot; would send you scurrying toward the zone.</div></div><hr />

I loved that life on the edge feeling it gave me at the time.  Once screwup and you where going to have the CR from hell(well, for a level 30 something anyway).</div></div><hr />

<br />
haha<br />
<br />
<br />
my favorite zone though is City of Mist. My backyard is going to look like that one day :D love the architechture.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Adzar</div><div class="date">05-17-2003, 08:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">heh I gotta say I love Griegs End just because half your group ends up looking like hideous ugly SOB's. That is pretty fun. I remember the first time I went there it took me like an hour to figure it out. I was like WTF our raid leader is a big ass bug!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Binnamar</div><div class="date">05-17-2003, 08:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah, Greigs end is fun too hehe.<br />
<br />
<br />
I remember I was a Female human.... woohooo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbo Baggins</div><div class="date">05-17-2003, 10:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i don't wanna see that...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Adzar</div><div class="date">05-17-2003, 11:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I thought you still were a female human /boggle</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">05-17-2003, 01:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My favorite zone would be a toss up between The Warrens (all the way from Jailer Mkragg to High Shaman Drogi, those dogs are the coolest!) and Nagafen's Lair (I love the tight corners, the lava, the music, Guano, even Nox).<br />
<br />
I think Batlings and the Mugglewump would give the Warrens the nod however, when pushed to make a decision.<br />
<br />
However, I think one of my all-time favorite moments in RECENT history was the first time I clicked on that windmill and zoned into Plane of Innovation.<br />
<br />
It was breathtaking. The music was perfect. The look of the zone was amazing. And as I zoned in, a guild was fighting Junk Beast at the zone line, with adds, so I was all up in the middle of some really cool looking fight, it just sort of rocked.<br />
<br />
Then I got blinded. Hah.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crist0</div><div class="date">05-17-2003, 03:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For the old world, I always liked the look of paw, deep inside anyway. Chardok always seemed the best zone out of kunark, and DN from velious. Acrylia was the absolute best from luclin(possibly because I remember one mouthy ranger app throwing a fit during ring of fire and walking out...and getting ported to the lava), PoI from pop, and torgiran mines in ykesha just because of the little imps in cages there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iskandar</div><div class="date">05-17-2003, 03:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">aesthetics - Sleeper's Tomb, Skyshrine, Katta Castellum, Sanctus Seru, Plane of Storms<br />
<br />
layout/implementation - Lower Guk, Old Sebilis<br />
<br />
sentimentality - the Karanas, Lake Rathe, Highkeep/Highhold, Qeynos/Surefall Glade</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbo Baggins</div><div class="date">05-17-2003, 11:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh and mine by the way would be either chardok or Kael. I dunno why kael it gets kind of boring but slaying vindi/statue/idol/AoW or just assisting is pretty fun. killing suff 100 feet taller then you looks kinda cool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Toga</div><div class="date">05-18-2003, 02:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Veksar is ok, great to look at , but i don't like the linear progression.<br />
ToV North was a blast.<br />
Old Sebilis = fav dungeon, i spent so much time 50-60 here it's not funny. I still love the zone, even if it's worthless now.<br />
I love the music is Plane of Earth, the deep bass lines really give it atmosphere.<br />
But my fav all around zone is still -- Howling Stones. The first time you fell in a pit was great, Usually ending in CR.  Well balanced zone, and really fun to work thru sequentially.<br />
Favorite boss mob fight? - Aaronyar.  Nothing like gearing up for months in tov east and west , to walk into north and get your collective asses handed to you by the Bouncer of NToV.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gallerus</div><div class="date">05-18-2003, 07:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I gotta go with sol ro tower too - only negative thing I can say about the zone is targetting = sucks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aakla</div><div class="date">05-18-2003, 10:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Siryns Grotto before it got double nerfed. nothing like 3, 400dmg quading 100%magic resistant mobs with agro range that rivals Fear mobs sitting right at the zone in. <br />
<br />
/gu Yeah its safe to zone in ....giggles.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donnel</div><div class="date">05-20-2003, 10:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Old World - Blackburrow. I don't know why, it just is. <br />
RoK - Kurn's Tower. The atmosphere, the mayham, the back story, and actually scoring a Solist's Icy Wand the last time we were there.<br />
Velious - Great Divide. Fighting a Shardwurm two weeks ago with my Wife and best friend. Our first dragon fight!<br />
PoP - Not been there yet<br />
Ykesha - Was in Gunthak last night, I absolutely love the shipwrecked beach! It just makes sense, and looks cool!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spinetwist</div><div class="date">05-20-2003, 03:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Katta Castellum is my favorite city. Love the Gotham City look!<br />
<br />
Favorite stomping grounds is Halls of Honor and Crypt of Decay.<br />
<br />
My favorite all time hunting grounds has to be Plane of Growth (when the protectors were busted). Clearing trash mobs for gems and armor for twinks was the bomb - and you could duo with a healer. Wide open spaces, nice green grasslands, a waterfall, and stickin it to Tunare!! /bliss</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerald</div><div class="date">05-20-2003, 04:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I liked Old Sebilis a LOT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gaylon</div><div class="date">05-20-2003, 04:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The zone I have had the most fun to date has to be the levels I spent &amp; lost in Temple of Droga :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zaos13</div><div class="date">05-20-2003, 04:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">old - Guk =)<br />
RoK- Sebilis or Chardok<br />
velious- ToV<br />
luclin- ssra, hate snakes hate fighting there, love the concept<br />
pop- i actually got into PoA one day was pretty cool...bot is cool and the details in CoD is tight =)<br />
ykesha-never been there /gasp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruges</div><div class="date">05-20-2003, 05:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would also have to say Black Burrow was my favorite zone. Being a Barbarian and all. I suppose it is my favorite since it was the first zone I started grouping in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dima</div><div class="date">08-28-2003, 01:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">old world - Sol B was ownage!<br />
<br />
Kunark - Liked VP<br />
<br />
Velious - DN by far, i always liked hoping the next little rickshaw rat inc had a weapon<br />
<br />
Luclin - Hum, took a 7 month break when it came out because of the graphics, so i didnt get too familiar with the expansion. Bazaar owns! =p<br />
<br />
PoP - BoT probably, those Agnarr encounter nameds look pimp<br />
<br />
LoY - someone goes there?<br />
<br />
p.s. go to cazic thule!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fenring</div><div class="date">08-28-2003, 02:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Greig's End alway wa smy favorite too, the illusions, sounds and weird emotes make it a creepy fun zone, can't wait to check out he revamped version.</div></div><hr />
