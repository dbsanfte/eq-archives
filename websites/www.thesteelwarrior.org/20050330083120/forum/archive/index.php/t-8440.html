<br />
we usually just go right, and all I ever see is umbiki.<br />
<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">snasty</div><div class="date">08-09-2004, 05:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">kill 12 or 13 mobs from any direction. 20 or so mobs will spawn and about 5 of them can be named.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Go up the right hand hill to corner.Continue clearing straight up the hill and if you like you can camp at the next corner where the road takes another right.There's a local spawn and 2 roamers there I think.Anyhoos,move up on the path a little and look into the cubby on your right.The second pooka in from the left is his ph.Kill it hehe.<br />
<br />
-Last couple times I found it easier to go inside his cubby and camp there as our chanter had to leave.Just gotta pick a good spot inside and keep it broke no roamers there.-</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">08-09-2004, 07:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah,Pumilio thats what I did hehe.He drops the earring I'm wearin too.Gl.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pumilio</div><div class="date">08-10-2004, 03:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ha, did it last night stupid umbiki and beluged whatever you call it, only killed umbiki, we got the hail mob but wiped so we all suicided ran in and said tend hehe, only I made it so gots to do again for wife hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Northerner</div><div class="date">08-10-2004, 03:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In that area you can clear up and down the hill a little bit as well as the Trickster's PH pretty easily.  With the fast respawn you should see ample nameds in a reasonably short time.  <br />
<br />
Good fortunes, I've killed him probably a dozen times now looking for earring drops and got only one.  The pants seem to be the far more common item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pumilio</div><div class="date">08-10-2004, 05:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">see the nice thing is pants or earring I'm set either way! =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">08-10-2004, 07:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah $$. Outa killing that Pooka 50 times or so i saw a lot of earrings and fewer pants/shrug.Also lost a lot of pant rolls hehe. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">korgo</div><div class="date">08-11-2004, 02:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the little cubby up the right side is where chavoor pops.  I've found that the best place to set up camp is in the pathway right outside his room.  There are 2 crag beast wanderers that path by (umbiki PH's) but other than that it's the safest spot in the zone.  <br />
<br />
Once the room is broken you can move in and keep the pooka's clear without fear of the crag beasts.  However you DO run the danger of having chavoor pop on you when you least expect him.  So keep a tight timer down on the repops in the room.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pumilio</div><div class="date">08-12-2004, 05:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">just make the group have the only plate wearers you and the cleric and the cleric bieng your wife wont be too hard to win the pants!  = )<br />

I r evil</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">08-12-2004, 06:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That depends on dps and pull speed.You may have to go up to keep his ph down efficiently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pumilio</div><div class="date">08-12-2004, 09:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">dps is always good with a pet =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ejryu</div><div class="date">08-13-2004, 10:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've always been a large fan of clearing up to the first static cragbeast and then pulling pookas into that corner.  Pulling the front pooka on the right will get you 2 adds, so you can either mez that one right away or drag all 3 back.  I *think* that's the pull where you'd get his PH.  If not, you'll just have 2 pookas left.  Chavoor will NOT add if he's up with that initial pull.  From there, you can move everyone down to the zone in and let the puller (enchanter!) do their thing.  Even if you wipe, it's an easy CR without a drag/summoner.  Oh and if nobody needs the loot that drops, you can gimp in someone that  could use.  My sk likes his burnished antique greaves $$  Oh, and watch the inevitable warps if you're pulling him down that far.  I was waiting at the bottom of the 2nd ramp to get in a slow attempt and BLAMO, right on top of me, smacked me down for 1%....then I got healed and treated Chavoor like a red-headed stepchild~</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DrachenfeldTP</div><div class="date">08-13-2004, 03:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">when i did the flags i got them all out of order, and it worked just fine, just need to do the usual randomphrasestodifferentnpcafewtimesover to sort it out.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pumilio</div><div class="date">08-14-2004, 03:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah didn't think so, interesting thing to note, wife now has vxed flag but never got a char message.<br />
<br />
<br />
but was in the zone when I said tend to the stonespiritist (never hailed or said jack to her)<br />
<br />
if one of you have the time and a unflagged player, have them be in the zone and get stonespiritist to spawn have a monk flop up and say tend, then leave and see if they now have flag, that may be easier then we all think now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DrachenfeldTP</div><div class="date">08-15-2004, 05:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">if you play a rogue all you need to do is get an invite to the adventure and run to the end of the zone and say the words, atleast that's how i got it.<br />
Think they nerfed it though.<br />
<br />
btw, you dont get any &quot;you receive a character flag&quot; message when you complete them, but it's still there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pumilio</div><div class="date">08-15-2004, 06:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">you get it if you say the words actually...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">08-16-2004, 02:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Trickster is evil.  I've killed him 6 times now and he's dropped 5 greaves, which I don't need, and 1 earring, which I do need but it's useable by all meleers and 4 people rolled on it.  sigh...  no, I didn't win.  The fooker keeps dropping greaves now.  /rude<br />
<br />
btw, does Umbiki (sp?) drop anything but that damn hybrid cloak?  I've seen it 5 or 6 times now and nothing else on him.  We gave away 3 of them to random guildies who ran over to vxed to loot and the last one rotted.</div></div><hr />
