This drops off of the Luggald Broodmother in crypt of nadox. I was wondering how many people this takes to kill, all 65's with ornate / no elemental. Also the dropprate if anyone knows.<br />
<br />
Its like a mini CHoS, and for how easy it could be to get it may be worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dethvegi1</div><div class="date">10-02-2003, 06:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just takes one person to kill.. Druid in my guild solo's this when he's bored.  Can be done with a group easy.  Drop rate, well., the broodmother will have it equipped if she has it. Seems to be fairly common. Went to watch him solo the script as i didn't believe him at the time.  I looted the hammer just for fun.  Proc rate is sub par, gets resisted alot in my findings.</div></div><hr />

Looks liek that Dark Ember druid weapon from the Ry'Gor Blacksmith in East Waste.  /screams UGLY !!!!!<br />
<br />
It procs alot, the message text in the weapon is wrong, says its an aoe, its not, its single target.  Nice proc graphic, looks like wizard harvest spell effects.<br />
<br />
But ... I thought they got rid of Broodmother and placed her with Innoruck??  And yes, she was EASILY soloed.  Did her alot with my druid looking for the Butt-Ugly-Weapon :/</div></div><hr />

<br />
hahahahahah, was NOT easy.  She is a 3-4 day spawn, well her trigger is, or was. Not even sure if she is still spawnable.   I ended up just binding the druid there (its a LONG run to that awful zone) and checking every day.<br />
<br />
With one 65 druid 4.5k mana it took me roughly 45-60 minutes to kill her.   I killed her 4 times before getting the weapon.  It was much easier, better exp, to camp the Droga weapons .....<br />

Butt-Ugly-Weapon+Butt-Long-Kill &lt; Droga weapons</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you know the Dark Ember druid thingee then it makes sense.<br />
<br />
Its a long bone blade with a hammer at the top.<br />
<br />
Just go to PoK and you'll bound to see some druid holding this huge overly unporoprtioned grey THING with a hammer head and a little spike sticking out of the middle :/</div></div><hr />

She walks around untargettable making spawns that you need to kill quickly before she spawns more.<br />
The way we did it was to have a Monk follow her around and pull the spawns to the force.<br />
Once she has done her spawn trek she is targettable and agros.<br />
Think of this as being similar to a Plane of Justice Trial but needing 2 groups.<br />
Having had both weapons from Droga as well as this hammer I personally prefer it to either droga. It procs alot in comparison.<br />
I also like having a weapon that every other level 45+ warrior doesnt have.<br />
Once I got my great staff of 4 winds I basically bagged my 2 1hand slashes though.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grendonbb</div><div class="date">10-03-2003, 03:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is a very nice weapon; makes a very good offhand.  Many of the wars in my guild have them; they got them from one of our necros soloing her, and then just coming in to loot it.  It is, however a fairly rare drop, so don't count on getting one immediately, because she is a long spawn time.<br />
<br />
In addition, it has a knockback of 2ft, which while not being huge, is a good deal more noticeable than most knockback you will see in more traditional weapons.</div></div><hr />
