<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tunk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Virtually all my LDoN points have gone towards anger auguments. Started out with a CHoS and SoTB, now a GBoS and I imagine soon a BF, BoC or HG. Then a decent 2 hander. I can't see myself spending LDoN points on anything other than anger auguments for a long while to come. Would it be unreasonable for SoE to make augments transferable among weapons? I dont care if it costs a bucket load of plat to do it (10k-50k?), I'd just like to be able to spend my points on something other than anger auguments.<br />

Reusable eliminates the time sink component and we all know that these expansions are mostly/partly to keep us occupied.<br />
<br />
I think, unfortunately, the other LDON points you spend will feel the same emptiness either sooner or later - if hp/ac on armor etc, it will get upgraded sometime and then you lose that augment too.  The question is, when?<br />
<br />
I would accumulate points prior to GOD and then see what GOD brings in terms of new agro weapons and armor.<br />

Then judge again.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Do what I did.  Buy an AngerIII aug and save it for one of those weapons you know you'll be using for a long time.  I happened to get mine about two months before I looted my Blade of War.  I had a Blade of Carnage at the time, but I decided augging a weapon that isn't no-drop (which I returned to the guild bank) wasn't worth it.  I held it in my inventory for that time and ended up augging the BoW before I even swung it.<br />
<br />
Now, you may not have a BoW in your grasp in a month or two, but a Greatblade of Storms, Blade of Carnage, or even a Bloodfrenzy may be.  Hold it out for one of those, because honestly, those are weapons that last a long while.<br />
<br />
Damnit, Haass is like always right too.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gyrfalcon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If the weapon in question will be upgraded and has an aggro proc already (ala GSOT, CHOS, etc), why spend 1150 points on it when you know you will be geting rid of it when you upgrade eventually? Spend 510 points and get the Anger 2 augment. It still procs a lot, and it's only a loss of 200 hate per proc. More than sufficient.<br />
<br />
When you finally get a weapon with a decent damage ratio (GSo4W, BoC, BoW), throw that Anger 3 augment on it and tank like there's no tomorrow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If you are anticipating upgrading your weapons soon it might be the wrong time to purchase an anger aug, though who is to say you will upgrade them both so quickly.  If you have a copper hammer and a sword of the bloodsworn put anger 3 in the hammer and wait till you get your first EB weap then offhand the hammer and aug your new primary.<br />
<br />
Unless your guild is progressing really quickly most people should be able to assess how long a certain piece of loot will last them.  If you are expecting to upgrade your greaves soon with the content your guild will be killing in the next 3 months then don't spend 1150pts on a hp aug.  <br />
<br />
In my own situation I have a few bits of loot that I will be wearing for a long time so put 40hp augs into them is well worth while.  So far I have added another 80hps to my gear during non-raid time (something I couldnt do with one group loot camps or in the bazaar) so to me LDoN is a worthwhile use of my time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So how long till your Blade of War drops and makes your BF/BoC combo obsolete?  Just a matter of time right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Wompem Ondahed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Augs are a gear upgrade just like any gear upgrade. If you think you will be getting something superior soon then don't aug it, but if you think you have an item that will last then go ahead and spend some points.<br />
<br />
I won't be getting a better haste or mask for a long time so i will slap 10ac on them  for the cost of 20 adventures. The fact that i enjoy burning through adventures with friends makes it a win on both sides. I certainly won't add 40hp to my Champ's Crown.<br />
<br />
Using good judgement with augs is the same as using good judgement with any upgrade. Make sure it is worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">May if you are in a raidign guild you know you will be replacing stuff soon, I am fairly sure that I will have my RA helmet (and its 36% haste aug) for a goodly long while. I think I could fairly safely say that about all RA armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">It's exactly like paying for ornate molds, or spending time / money to get velious quest items / gems.  You don't camp HoT and buy gems for SS armor if you are going to replace it soon.  Use your points wisely.  People tanked with those weapons before Anger augs, so you don't have to put them on.  But if you have an item that you won't be replacing for some time, it's a nice bonus.  And if you do replace it, so what?  Do people complain when they replace an item that they spent a lot of time getting?  It's a lot the same idea imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">So how long till your Blade of War drops and makes your BF/BoC combo obsolete? Just a matter of time right?I've had my bloodfrenzy over a year, and my bbb over 8 months. I aug'd both of them the same night, about 3 weeks after LDoN went live. That's hardly a week later, which was the basis of my remark to that reference. I don't regret aug'n the bbb, I won't regret auging a BoW nor do I regret aug'n BF. <br />
<br />
You don't like LDoN? No one said you have to. Stating any time spent in ldon is a waste is a bit much tho. Last I checked i'm still getting xp, getting upgrades via charm bonus progression and getting some loot to further line my gold plated high stool.<br />
<br />
Lub LDoN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Northerner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I've always said, to maintain balance with casters we need an Item Solvent.  Something that saves the augment and kills the item holding it.<br />
<br />
Where is my Horror as a pre-elemental melee?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>BigAlFoxTrot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I agree with Anger2 being a better bang for buck.<br />
<br />
If you think you are going to upgrade then just go with Anger2 as it's way more efficient as far as points.<br />
<br />
I put Anger2 on my BOC and CHSD and I am an agro procing maching.  Anger3 on both would have been overkill.<br />
(Ill get the point for Anger3 wilst i wait on my shot at a BOW)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I feel your pain.  I have bought 2 anger III augments so far, and I can see myself getting another one if a BoW drops for us and I win it.  I agree with Wompem though, it's no different than spending 30 hours in Droga for faction or doing any other quest for an equipment upgrade that you will eventually replace.  I don't regret augmenting my BF and BoC at all, although it will be kind of tough to dissolve that 1150 points out of my BoC if I ever pass it down hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Friedrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">In my opinion, 1 Anger III proc is better than 2 Anger II's.  Why you ask?  Look at the simple math.<br />
<br />
Anger III mainhand, 2 procs per minute = 1200 Hate per minute.<br />
<br />
Anger II main/offhand, 2 procs main, 1 proc off per minute = 1200 Hate per minute.<br />
<br />
Hmm, so now if I upgrade off hand I immediately lose 400 Hate per minute via proc going Anger II route.  If you swap primal in and out of offhand, I still get 1200 Hate from main hand procs, with Anger II I will get 800 or if lucky 1200 if both primal and offhand fire in the minute.<br />
<br />
IMO, the Anger III is worth the extra 100ish points over 2 Anger II's just from the fact you can upgrade your other dual wield weapon and keep the same aggro from the procs.  It would also allow you to not Hate aug a decent DPS weapon to keep for those non tanking situations.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Khumak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">IMO, get Anger II if you think you might upgrade soon and aren't willing to wait.  Personally, I think LDON is the best expansion to date:<br />
<br />
1  It's easier to get groups because grouping is required so there's more solo classes actually grouping.<br />
2  You earn points on every mission to spend however you want.<br />
3  Nobody ever trains you or steals your camp<br />
4  All of the camps are easy to get to via the Magus<br />
<br />
Sure, you'll eventually replace items that you augment.  But you'll eventually replace any item you get.  If you think anything you might replace at a later time is a waste of time then you're wasting your time unless you Bought a level 65 character that was flagged for Time and started out doing nothing but raiding PoTime.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I don't think I would call LDoN the best expansion yet(Velious is too dear to me), but it was a damn good one.  Required grouping(I far prefer time in groups than solo anyway), more ways to improve yourself(you get exp, a chance at drops and  earn points that can get some very nice things), and no BoT/KC type annoying trains/shouting matches/camp disagreements.<br />
<br />
As far as the original comment...you don't have  to anger 3 anything, it is just nice.  And remember that while you are working towards anger 3(or any other point punchase), you are also gaining exp, cash, and some decent drops off names(well, some are decent).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Daze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Been using a BF with anger III , Splitblade (20 ac 90 hp ) in off hand , or a shield if a big hitting riposting mob <br />

GREAT AGRO, and if i use a Copperhammer with anger II , <br />
our local level 65 SK told me he just couldnt get agro off me !<br />

sick game that we do our utmost to get hit ?:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>ODB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">If you're a slave to that piece of shit expansion, it's because you think you have to be. Well, I won't say LDoN is a pos, but I do agree with you. When Lost came out, I was here telling you guys Im not going to buy that anger crap, that it was BS to have to buy aggro process because 989/VI/SOE messed up. I stuck to it too. I dumped 100dd cold based on my Ornate Greatblade, 50dd fire based on my Bloodfrenzy, 125yak on my BoW, 125ruj on my SEM, and 150ruj on DBoW. I got a DoD that I offhand and I still pwn for aggro so screw non damage weapon augs~</div></div><hr />
