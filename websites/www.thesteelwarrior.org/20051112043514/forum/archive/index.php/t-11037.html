Currently, Exalted is impossible to get to, except MAYBE with darnassus with that godforsaken Morrowgrain quest.<br />
<br />
Exalted allows you to get an opposite faction's mount, like a human being able to ride a nightsaber.<br />
<br />
And no, if you kill horde near a town, you shouldn't be getting any faction hits.</div></div><hr />

Ok Well my book does not say A I M P R but it does state i need to grab book next time i post, that if you kill, dont remeber if it said NPC or horde player that u gained small fraction points. Now it does make sense but it said if u kill lower lvl than you are you lose points but if you kill high lvl or your lvl you actually gain points.</div></div><hr />

You can get exhalted with Argent Dawn, although that won't help your mount situtation.  <br />

Great timing, Apophis! I only just received the answer to this inquiry moments ago. Currently it's not possible to obtain the Exalted status necessary to obtain another race's mount. The development team realizes that this is a problem and are actively working on adding faction quest content that can be repeated by players, similar to what exists for the Argent Dawn factional quests. <br />
<br />
Please keep in mind that the faction currently being gained will still be useful when the said changes have been implimted, as players will be that much closer to hitting the Exalted mark. <br />

That said, a human has obtained exalted status with Darnassus from doing the Morrowgrain quest:<br />
<br />
<br />
3 months after Merrissa (human) started her journey, she rides out of Darnassus on the back of a Frostsabre. <br />

1 guild <br />
around 5000 grain <br />
around 10000 dirt <br />
and countless minutes... <br />

She spent three months of her life doing this faction work, and started at 48 and did no other leveling in order to optimize quest reward faction.</div></div><hr />

Gnomes, while admittedly already kinda goofy looking, look just plain odd sitting on a human horse.</div></div><hr />
