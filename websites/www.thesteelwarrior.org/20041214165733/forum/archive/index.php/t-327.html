<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cartolis</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 01:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hello again all,<br />
 I have been seriously considiring switching to another class due to some major agro woes.<br />
<br />
not some of this is due to my friends playstyle.<br />
they are good at what they do, but as a warrior my job is to get and hold agro and sponge up the damage.<br />
<br />
I cant do that with the ranger and druid that I play with.<br />
More importantly, I'm not having fun because I keep losing agro, and dammit, I'm not suppose to:P<br />
<br />
anyway on to the questions.<br />
first off, at level 59 as a barb warrior should I be using kick or slam? now slam has a small stun, and both can interupt casters, but the recycle time on slam seems to be way too long.<br />
<br />
would getting a shield and using bash be worth losing the dps from the offhand wep? not to mention the proc agro.<br />
<br />
thanks for any help you can offer,<br />
 Cartolis</div></div><hr />

<br />
until SoE fixes furious bash, i see no advangage in using a shield, mass loss in DPS and hit frequency (proc optional) is gonna cost you tons of aggro<br />
<br />
as for the kick/slam thing, dunno im a newb<br />
<br />
I cant do that with the ranger and druid that I play with. <br />
<br />
ok its the ranger's job to control his aggro, thats why they get jolt, i have the same problem with them in pickups (not stereotyping, i know some great rangers) where they wont jolt and think its fun to cast weeds/flame-lick constantly, for that i dont think theres much more you can do about it other than talk with him. When i group with my friends, and im qualified to be mt i usually ask the monk (if present)to FD away from group and let me pull aggro with a bow and keep it for about 8 secs, as soon as i turn on auto attack i hit taunt, if i see anyone jump in before it refreshes i make sure they here about it, if something bad happens, i bring up what went wrong, but in the same light im the first to say &quot;good job guys&quot; or &quot;nice aggro management on that one&quot;<br />
<br />
ive noticed, especially 50+ warriors have to take a leadership role in groups, if they want to do their job, dont be hateful about it, just pretend your a commando deep in the heart of brazil and your group is your strike team, if someone over aggros ask them to (insert class aggro dump technique here) when something weird happens like adds, and you have great aggro management and recovery during the pull, be sure and tell them about it, thats what i do<br />
<br />
but i think i might be crazy, *shrug*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 02:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The recycle time for slam and kick is the same.  Slam has a higher skill cap (it works off bash skill, bash caps alot higher than kick).  The only way I'd use a shield is if it were a furious bash shield, and even then it's situational.  Keep kick skilled up for times when you're in under effect of an illusion (wolfform, tricksters) and can't slam, but slam is the way to go for most situations.  And you're wrong,  your job is not to get and hold aggro.  The druid's and ranger's job is to try hard not to take aggro from you.  Any idiot with a mana bar can pull a mob off a warrior, their job is to manage their own aggro so that you take the beating.  If your gear is lacking that will make it harder for them to do that, but it's still their job not yours.  Anyone who tells you different is either misinformed, or has gotten lazy from grouping with paladins and sk's and their insta aggro spells. :)  If you are using your best aggro weapons, whatever they may be, and taunting the mobs when snares or heals cause aggro, and making use of positional aggro when possible, then you are indeed doing your job.  Your friends need to do all they can to help you keep the mob's attention or just resign themselves to the beatings they're going to take.<br />

Its really frustrating for me, cause the ranger keeps almost dieing.<br />
<br />
the only reason he survives is the druid(his wife) will dump her whole mana bar healing him when he gets agro.<br />
<br />
even with a frostbringer/club of the ice ocean combo and spamming taunt/kick till i get carpal tunnel I simply cannot get agro if he dosnet jolt.<br />
<br />
I've come to the conclusion that I'm gonna mention it once more, and then either find a diffrent regualr group or just level another character and let the ranger be mt :P<br />
<br />
shouldnt be too long before he asks me to come back as the warrior :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wulfran</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 06:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One comment that I will make that a lot of people won't necessarily agree with is that a lot of warriors put too much emphasis on aggro procs and not enough on attack speed.<br />
<br />
Through the bulk of the 50s for me, I used a Seb Croaking dirk in my main (10/18 piercer with no proc) and a frostbringer in the off hand. I relied on # of attacks and my OK DPS (for that level) to generate and hold aggro. I won't claim it was perfect, and it was against kunark/velious/luclin mobs (that don't hit anywhere near as hard as Tier 1 for the most part, when I DID lose it) but it worked.<br />
<br />
An aggro proc is only your friend if it goes off and I have always found them extremely unreliable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iskandar</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 07:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Speed is important but until Elemental levels a warrior's ATK/DPS will almost always be less than any other pure melee's (except a bard's). Procs help close that gap. They aren't perfect but EB/Rune III/Descending Might are what we have. Also generally EB weapons are comparable in DPS to the other weapons you can get at that level of the game (comparing Bloodfrenzy to Ifir is flawed, for example).<br />
<br />
Also I bet that Frosty's proc helped ya out too. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">weoden</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 07:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the ranger needs to watch his agro and you need to complain about it often.  One way to help increase agro is to get a better haste item or try to get higher dex.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Whulff McBeast</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 09:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">why worry about the regular group .. go out and have some fun .. and honestly .. it sounds like your friends are at fault .. and not really you .. most all casters and rangers know their limits .. i mean by what it takes to get aggro .. Warriors are fun to play .. and alot of times can be frustrating now with PoP and Paladins *booo* being a more sought after class from what i have noticed due to stun/aggro capabilities.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kalantek</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 11:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">even with a frostbringer/club of the ice ocean combo  <br />
<br />
imho, upgrade the club, its a bit slow, and the proc doesnt get the aggro needed to compensate, grab a Black Blade of Tormenting for around or under 500pp, its what i use, and i havent ever used better i can honestly say<br />
<br />
and spamming taunt/kick till i get carpal tunnel  <br />
<br />
if your spamming the entire encounter, dont, save it for when u need to gain aggro, taunting when u have aggro is a wasted taunt. Also have you neglected dissarm? i keep dissarm on a hotkey so i taunt and dissarm in one press, dunno if it helps alot, but it doesnt hurt</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylviania</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 05:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">as most people here said , learn your ranger to control aggro. with jolt spells he should never be near dead on a tanked mob. he may take a few hits from ripostes or sporadic overaggro, but usually a good ranger is a ranger able to take care of himself alone : manage his aggro , heal himself if a bit low life. <br />
Even if we still are happy when the healer heal us a bit after fight ( a bit only ... 'INC CH ON Sylv' , 'uh , u know i missed less than 1000hps ? ...' is one thing is really dislike to see ).</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's true that if you were a paladin your friends wouldn't have to learn about aggro control or reduce their damage output.<br />
<br />
Not much you can do with a ranger and druid who don't know about aggro control though.<br />
<br />
The simplest solution I can suggest is that they root the mobs on inc, and you hug them close to tank while the ranger keeps a little further away and both of them lay off the nukes (which will break root).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mokor</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 07:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">nothing like a ranja with epic slow that procs every 5 seconds, snares on inc, dots, and chain nukes chewing you out for not keeping agro and haveing to mem the jolt line, and then find out his also hitting taunt. or drood who dot stacks and then starts chaining moonfire and epic dot, and uses the high agro heal.<br />
<br />
the education must begin. only you can prevent ranja death</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylviania</div><div class="date">04-30-2003, 05:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">mmm , no , only the ranger can't prevent ranger death :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">04-30-2003, 06:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">one reason why you are having trouble could be that the ranger has his epic and if yournot grouped with a haster this puts you at a disadvantage against epiced rangers. also, make sure he doest cast snare etc early on in the fight.<br />
<br />
also, cant see your magelo so not sure what your own haste items are.<br />
<br />
all things being equal, you shouldnt have a problem holding aggro with that combo - i cant say ive ever had serious problems against epic monks/rangers/rogues, as long as they are not being stupid.<br />
occasionaly they may get aggro but can normally be taken back with a couple of taunts. cept there was one time when i was with a ranger with snowchipper in primary......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Argot_tz</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 10:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I see your problem not as a result of lacking gear, but more as a result of using your taunt skill wrong.<br />
Taunt's only function is to bring you 1 point above the player who is highest on the hate list, so, if you press taunt everytime it pops it is most likely you would end up just giving yourself 1 more hate point than it is to make any real difference. Try to save your taunt for when you loose agro, just one succesfull taunt will then have you on top of the hate list again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">thRover</div><div class="date">05-03-2003, 10:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've worked very hard to get my warrior to level 55 and I have to say that aggro management is such a problem that I don't even enjoy playing my warrior anymore. In fact I dread being asked to tank in the planes after so many groups where people (almost always the slower) have died because I can't do what I'm expected to do in a group. I'm reasonably well equiped, I dual wield Vengeful Yaks (the best I could afford, and from what I've seen they are at least as good as all the combo's being mentioned all the time on these boards), my weapon skills are maxed, my taunt is maxed, there is not much more I can do to make myself more effective as a tank. I plan to work on my Dex, and Str a bit to increase my hits and my proc frequency but that takes time and/or money.<br />
Now I agree that there are people who you can hunt with who don't know how to manage their own aggro and get themselves in situations that don't have to exist. I've hunted with many of them myself. There are also groups with people who know very well how to handle themselves but even then it is a chore to keep aggro, especially on the slow. People prefer using Pally's and SK's as the MA most of the time because of their ability to get aggro solidly early on and hold it throughout the fight. I don't blame them really. Why use a tank that makes you wait to cast slow, using up the clerics mana, and who is always in danger of losing aggro when you can just take someone who can gain aggro right off the pull, the mob can be slowed before it ever hits anyone, and who can hold aggro throughout the rest of the fight? <br />
I don't want to sound too negative, I still love my warrior. He is still my main focus in this game, but it gets so frustrating sometimes that it is not an enjoyable experience hunting with him. Anyhow I come here and read the post where everyone is so supportive of us as a class (wouldn't expect anything less from THE warrior message board), that I go out with renewed energy and continue to level up, hoping someday to be able to do my job as a tank without any worries.<br />
So, good luck to everyone, keep fighting the good fight!</div></div><hr />
