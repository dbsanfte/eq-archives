Which is harder Veskar or Chardok? Any tips would be appreciated also</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Klozz</div><div class="date">04-04-2004, 11:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Both zones have some faulty aggro issues.  The more difficult mobs (hit harder, more hps) definitely reside in Veksar.  Chardok is difficult to navigate without a rogue, as you need certain keys to get into the various wings.  Chardok is almost a progression type of situation, as there is only wing you are able to access at first (without a rogue that is).  The key that can be obtained in that wing allows you to access the next wing, and basically each wing allows you to access the next wing until you finally get access to all four wings.  <br />
<br />
Both zones are very much worth exploring.  However, if your server is anything like mine, both are very empty, and will require you to bring your own group.  CR's are also, potentially, very messy in both zones.</div></div><hr />

Although you're right about the rogue, I believe you're referring to Howling Stones (Charasis) there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry, you're right, I was referring to Charasis.</div></div><hr />

Odd, my necro spends a lot of time in Veksar and i never had issues with wall aggro.<br />
<br />
if you have a lvl 65 necro friend, con them into camping a soulscream belt and giving to you as a gift :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">04-06-2004, 07:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">there is only one spot where through wall agro screwed my group. I've exploered all of Veksar.<br />
<br />
The through wall agro is pretty damn deep in the dungeon thought its right where you go down some ramp and then there is a house with stairs. Fighting the mobs down stairs brought us mobs from upstairs too. Its like 10ish mobs total, but if you pull stuff you are ok.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lathen</div><div class="date">04-21-2004, 05:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If all you want from Veksar is the soulscream belt, then I'd say Veks is &quot;easier&quot; than Chardok. Both have their challenges.<br />
<br />
The camp where you find the soulscream belt is easy(ish) to get to with a single group whose members are in the mid-50's. Once there, you need to be able to handle a camp with fewer than 7 static spawns and no roamers. If your group can suppress the urge to &quot;scout&quot;, then you get to control the amount of danger you handle.<br />
<br />
I don't really have proof of this, but Chardok just feels harder to me. I admit freely that my experience in Chardok is tainted by a Royals raid I led earlier this week. We wiped the raid twice (I hate the queen -- she STILL has my epic drop) and spent more hours in the zone than I'm willing to admit (though we DID get our cleric and enchanter fixed up for epic drops).<br />

<br />
Do you really care about making your Chardok faction any worse?</div></div><hr />

Killed Korokust(sp?) in CharB alot. Even when we killed the royals in CharA for cleric/warrior epic pieces i was still ally....lol</div></div><hr />
