<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kelorm</div><div class="date">05-09-2003, 02:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Was thinking of going to ME with a couple friends this weekend to see if we could get axgoreth's belt and grodan's idol to drop, would both be great upgrades. Really just looking for things I can single group as upgrades, was thinking of steel wrapped leggings as well. Budget is next to nil, so buying isn't really an option, unless you could suggest some sell for x amount and buy this better item for less :D . Can get usually 55+ monk sham mage x2 druid x3 or 4, 62 chanter, 51 cler, and myself...or any mix of the above. Magelo is linked below for your viewing pleasure.<br />

Anyway, thanks in advance for any suggestions.<br />

Find a human GM or close smith and become their farm bitch.  Go farm the crap out of Sand giants or the chromadarkes and essence of sunlight.  Slaughter griffons to get griffons blood or just buy it.  Work out a deal with the smith to get more pieces of FH, its gonna take you a long ways, or just farm cash items to buy it.  big upgrades of FH would be bracers, arms, gloves, boots greaves, cloak and shoulders.  not sure about your neck, but might wanna toss in a RBG in waist and get a FH neck as well.  And as always, level level level.</div></div><hr />
