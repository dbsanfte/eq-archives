You hail him, ask the right question (I forget what it was but it was easy) and poof you have an expedition.<br />
<br />
Mobs have static and wandering spawns, they aren't random like ldon.  Xp was quite nice, 2-3 kills per % xp in level 68, or 3% aa per kill.<br />
<br />
We didn't get very far in, it was a pickup group, with no cleric, a shaman for main healer, and no mezzer.  Mobs at zone in area were all level 66, and did not see invis.  It is my understanding that there are various named with PHs throughout the zones, that drop runes and other stuff, and there are 2  bigger named that the NPC who gives the expedition mentions.</div></div><hr />

The rats and bats con'd indifferent until we attacked a Murkglider (con'd KoS).  Mobs are social.  Exp wasnt bad but we opted to move onto the ruins.  Is their a point to this expadition or is it just another zone to exp in?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bardeil</div><div class="date">09-23-2004, 11:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've done 3 of them now, so far the only time I saw a named the spawn was bugged or something and there were 6 of him and another 5 rats all in the exact same spot. Since he was a red con we left him alone. Named seem to be rare, xp is pretty decent for the difficulty. I'm not sure what level you have to be to spawn the one with the level 66 mobs, it must be higher than level 66 because when I spawned one at 66 I got normal ldon mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abazagaroth</div><div class="date">09-23-2004, 01:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Every time I've done one of those expeditions the experience was *terrible* (5-6% per hour) relative to dranik ruins, or elemental. However, the expeditions are great for rune acquisition (hopefully it wasn't modified in this patch). We got 5 runes last night in 4 hours for example.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">09-23-2004, 03:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I assume the runes only drop off named there.  I'm surprised you actually got 5 named in 4 hours.  I tried one of these expeditions for a little bit... saw no named, got horrible exp, and was very bored.<br />
<br />
We cleared to what we knew was a named PH and then camped it a few cycles with no luck.  <br />
<br />
Can you just invis straight to the PH and camp it with any success?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bardeil</div><div class="date">09-23-2004, 03:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How the hell are you guys finding named? I've had rotten luck with them, what with having spent 8 hours or so in these expeditions. Do you just respawn them until one shows up on track and then farm him and his ph? I guess my problem is I just don't know where the ph's are...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">09-23-2004, 03:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think named in expedition are just rare spawns.  They're decent XP, pretty much same as XP outside minus the pulling time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">09-23-2004, 03:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are 3 expeditions I think, I can only speak for sure about the 'Murkglider' one.  There are 2 PH's for named here that I know of.  'a hideous rat' and 'a tatterwing bat'.  Enter zone, get IVU(murkgliders are undead), stay left at intersections(I think there is only one on the way), untill you come to a room with 'a hideous rat' .  The path out of this room to the right dead ends with 'a tatterwing bat' at the end.  Set up in this dead end tunnel, and start pulling.  Respawn is I think 14 minutes, and about 1 in 3 spawns ends up being a named instead of the PH.  Note that as of 2 nights ago, there was a bug, and a red con to 68 spawns in the same room as 'a hideous rat'...Dragorn somethingorother.  He will keep spawning there, even if unkilled at a fairly rapid rate, until there can be 20 some of these mobs stacked together, generating some nice lag.  If you are quick getting there, you can get to this room before he spawns the first time, and farm him.  easy kill and good exp, drops a nodrop ring with no stats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">09-23-2004, 03:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are different expeditions depending on your level.  If you're under 68 you get an easier one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">09-23-2004, 05:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The expeditions themselves are the same, just the mob level changes.    These have no lockout time, see we just keep trying till we get the Murkglider one.  I believe, tho I have no proof of this other than word of mouth and the fact that it seemed to be the case, that the level of the expedition is determined by the person getting the expedition.  So make sure you have a 68 + get the expedition.  Even so, exp sharply declines at 69 in these zones.</div></div><hr />

We've located 2 named spawn points and we clear one then invis to the other and clear there. We got a cycle timed perfectly between the 2.<br />

However, runes seem to be the rare drop (of course). I won the 68 rune today in fact (although will try to trade for 66 as I wont be 68 for weeks most likely).<br />

I've been getting ~12% exp (lvl 66)  in 2.5 hrs by doing this. Lvl 67 guildy was getting ~7% in the same time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What were the Ph's for the named in Firepits?<br />
<br />
Also, runes seem to me to drop about 1 in 3 named, with named being about 1 in 3 on PH spawn.  Lastly, if you have some one in group 68 +, or can get some one 68 + to get the expedition for you, then leave and be replaced, you will get a higher level expedition and get much better exp.  Ofc, higher DPS groups will do better here(my set group includes me, mellee nut cleric, wizzy, mage, chanter(who nukes alot), and shaman, who curses, DoT's and nukes hard.  With this group, with the cleric(68 and 69 at time we were doing these) getting the expedition, I could get 10 % + per hour at 66 and 67.  We are all EP geared as a further reference.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The second ph, i dont remember the name, but the room the zone long hallway goes to, is the mob in the far left corner.</div></div><hr />

At L66 you're given a lower level version of the dungeon where the mobs are L60.  I figured that out because my L65 2 boxed cleric got pretty good exp, my L66 warrior got crap.<br />
<br />
Some guildies were in the zone last night and doing pretty well.  They were higher level now, group average close to 68 and I think a L69 requested the adventure.  Many of the mobs were L66.  That would be good exp all the way to 70.</div></div><hr />

I was 66 and the exp was actually very good.  I hit 67 and the exp just stopped.   I am glad to see the zone will pick up exp again after you lvl up more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomos</div><div class="date">09-25-2004, 09:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I was level 68 to get expeditions, I spent about 6 hours grinding in hollows, the group was mostly WAR CLR CLR RNG SHM NEC, gained 40% xp in 6 hours.<br />
<br />
THe spawn for that dragorn is definitely bugged, first time we xped a lot early in zone, then went deeper, the ranger was out in front and pulled, and all oru screens bogged down.  Ranger died fast way out ahead of us, and then we saw this long train of mobs going back to it's single spawn location, took about 2 minutes.  Musta been 60-100 mobs on that spawn loc (this was in hollows B, the fire pits I think).<br />
<br />
We never could find the PH for the named in the fire pits.  Later we got another expedition, and we got the murkglider/rat/bat one.  We had just gotten to the PHs when raid was called, so we had to bail.<br />
<br />
Pulls in these are generally pretty easy, I can pull them myself and usually get singles, occasionally 2 mobs, very rarely 3, which can be rooted.  The more DPS you have in these the better.  BTW, mobs don't summon, are a bit resistant but are fully slowable, and nothing we saw could see invis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">boy-</div><div class="date">09-25-2004, 12:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The location of phs seem to not only depend on what zone you get, but also what lvl the mobs are.   Sometimes the ph has the wierd name ie 'a noc warrior', but there's also instances where it doesn't.  <br />
<br />
For example, for the lvl 68 firepits, one of the phs is the girplan that sits in the room in the northmost east-west hallway, on the eastern side, in a small room that also has a discordling.    If you follow this hallway further in when it turns south, the static rat with the wierd name is the ph for the named dragorn, who is really fun to bug since he ends up being decent xp.<br />
<br />
So it seems to be a real pain in the ass, whenever you gain a level or two, you gotta learn new ph's.  yay.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was just coming here to mention that I thought this was the case.  A 3 boxer in my guild has been slowly farming these for his spell runes, just his 3 toons.  None are over 66 yet.  My group is mostly 68 and 69.  I was talking to the 3 boxer about success rates, his was consitantly higher than ours.  Then I mentioned the named we were killing as we talked, and he had never seen that named.  So we started comparing notes.  While he had the same 2 PH's, his where in a different loc, spawned different drops, and seemingly dropped runes at a much higher rate.  He has consistantly gotten roughly 3 out of 4 named with a rune, while we consistantly get 1 out of 3.  I suspect this may be intentional:  a way to discourage people higher level from going in and farming lower level spell runes that they no longer need for themselves.  You will still get the runes, but much slower.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bashiae</div><div class="date">09-27-2004, 03:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have done the Dranik's Hallows: Murkgliders Hive expedition with a full group 3 times now (once a night), as well as a few times just duoing with my cleric, and I am quite impressed with the experience.  I started doing them at level 68, however, so as mentioned, every time the mobs have almost all been level 66.<br />
<br />
That said, for level 66 mobs, they're a complete joke.  I found it difficult to convince people to do these, as they have a severe fear of being unable to mez things without a high end enchanter with their new mez spells, but in actuality, in my experience, mez was not only unnecessary, it would've slowed things down.<br />
<br />
My first group there, which was more of an exploration since we had no idea what to expect, was: 68 War (myself), 65 War, 65 Clr, 65 Dru, 66 Rng, and 67 Shm.  Obviously, we were pretty low on DPS, but the mobs are so weak in terms of damage output, I found it very easy to tank two or three at once as long as slows were done, without any risk whatsoever.  (Note: I buffed to about 9000 HP with Virtue, Focus, and max stamina at the time of our adventure, so not high end by any means.)  The second Warrior was essentially the offtank, and on multiple pulls we'd just split things up and go to town - As mentioned, pulling is very easy and you can usually tell before pulling whether you'll get one or two mobs (rarely, you can get three, but not often).  On a side note, as also mentioned, since the indifferent mobs assist, I would suggest killing them along the way, as they may roam back onto you during another fight - had a few times this happened when we were trying to speed through to get to the bugged Dragorn spawn, and ended up with 4 or 5 in camp.  Again, with slow, very managable.<br />
<br />
Edit: Wanted to add a minor note.  All of the group members, with the exception of the shaman and myself, were in pre-Ssra level gear, with a few random Ornate pieces and the like.  Our experience rate with the aforementioned group was about 8 - 9% an hour for level 68, whereas my 65 cleric got his remaining 8% to 66 and finished with 42% into level 66, and we spent just over 3.5 hours there.<br />
<br />
I've seen 5 named spawns in the Murkgliders, and have yet to see a rune drop (not a big deal to me personally, just a tidbit of information.)  Unfortunately, the regular drops from the two named mobs (they are the ones mentioned by the expedition giver; I don't know if there are any other nameds spawns, but I somewhat doubt it) are complete crap for the levels.  You might find someone in the group or your guild who could use the upgrade, but most likely it's just going to be Bazaar fodder, which was disappointing =/  (We saw a number of 65 hp/mana leather bracers and ditto in the form of caster boots, as I recall).<br />
<br />
As for the bugged Dragorn, since I've only done one of the three instances, I wasn't able to confirm it, but after reading others posts claiming there is a bugged Dragorn in the other instances, perhaps there is a reward for collecting the drop from each of the three Dragorns and handing it into the expedition giver or another NPC?  I'll try to sneak down there (invis seems to work quite well with a few exceptions, at least in the Murkgliders) before the fast spawns start and kill the Dragorns.  I did turn in one ring from the Murkglider version to the expedition guy, but he didn't respond or give anything back.  However, it may be worth noting, he did eat the ring - he did not give the normal &quot;I have no use for this Bashiae, you may have it back.&quot;  Perhaps that indicates something, I'm not sure.<br />
<br />
Anyone else tested handing in any of the Dragorn drops?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khabok</div><div class="date">09-27-2004, 05:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Spent some time in I think the Fire Pits expo last night. We had 3 Lvl 65's and a 58 cleric and 59 chanter, who dinged 60 and exp seemed pretty good. We didnt have a high DPS group by any means and didnt find any named but was still a pleasant night.<br />
<br />
    Is it possible that with faction, maybe one of the other red con Dragorns around will offer expos that actually have a purpose and a goal, like the GoD Sewer expos where there are trial versions and then experience versions ?   There are a lot of those high level Dragorns that basically ignore everyone that must have some purpose once the right factions are raised.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With no change in the requesters level (me, lvl 69), the mobs went from fully slowable a few days ago to partial slow and hitsliketruck now.  The difference we're seeing in the dps that trash is putting out is massive.<br />
<br />
Any one else notice this, or is it some adjustment to my instance that i'm missing?</div></div><hr />

<br />
    The scary part is we use invis undead and run in to first named PH, kill that, then IU to the bat PH and kill it. Then go back to tunnel where rat one is and pull the local and murkgliders till respawn. Once murks are cleared you can run between the nameds each cycle as bats and rats arent aggro.<br />
<br />
   Well in about 12 cycles, we had the named rat spawn 7 times in a row, and got the named bat 3 times. We were starting to think the rat was broken but we finally got a PH again. Only 2 runes though out of 10 named, one 67 and one 68. And we need to learn one of the others soon as the named loot is going to go to waste soon, even with giving to guildies and alts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We have been doing firepit alot. The first PH is indeed &quot;a noc warrior&quot; just on the other side of the big round firepit. The named is Kyv Caveheart, he drops and decent FT 3 shield and a not so great neck piece for bst ranger bard ber. He can also drop Minor Lesser and Regular Muramite runes. To get to him from zone in invis up and run straight down the hall. Do not take any turns at the junctions just go straight and you will run right into this room. The repop in this zone is almost exactly 20 minutes. The ph will be up when you zone in. Have to kill the ph first time to get a name to pop. Chance of named popping seems to be about 1 in 3. I have heard if you get 5 ph in a row to reset tthe mission its bugged. This is for a 65 and 66 mission. I think the next break upwards is 68. We had a 62 get mission once and it was a lower one with a different named but in same place. So it looks like there are atleast 3 different levels of missions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaltek_Eci</div><div class="date">10-03-2004, 09:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Have noticed the trash is more difficult. They hit closer to 700 than I remember while before they used to hit around 600 max more often. Also I used to 3 box them Clr War Rng as it gave me something to do in the few hours I have before work during the week when nobody else is on.<br />
<br />
Holy Elixer used to keep the tank up ok on trash unslowed and slowed (50% by ranger) it was cake but now even slowed by the ranger their DPS is overcoming the healing of holy elixer (900 a tick with heal over time crits 1) all the time =/<br />
<br />
I did a 8 hour stint in Murkgliders on friday Oct 1st and saw 1 named rat which dropped only boots and no rune. Was depressed to say the least. In 3 hours before work I used to be able to get 1 or often 2 runes and like 5 or 6 named =(<br />
<br />
I think it's been nerfed beyond the old greenie exploit of having a low level start it and killing 4k hp mobs for runes. I think they did overkill on this honestly =/<br />

PS-&gt; War is 12k hp and 2200 AC level 68 buffed</div></div><hr />

Seemed some mobs mitigate slow, some of the trash in Murkgliders Hollow hits a bit harder than it did, and the drop rates are a little screwy.<br />
<br />
Some guildies/friends and I have been farming these for runes. Friday were there 4 hrs and went 1 name and 0 runes the whole time. Last night, I was there with some friends (druid, shammie, enc, bard and mage... like I said friends not a killing machine group :p ), most of us were 66-67 but the Mage was 70 and got the expedition. We went 1 name, 0 runes and 0 augment stones in the first 2 1/2 hrs. Then we were 6 names and 5 runes in the last hr (grats me lotsa 1900 pt tribute junk :p). So not sure if they messed with spawn rates of names or if they are just streaky (/rude RNG).<br />
<br />
As an added bonus, we made 30% ish in our levels and the mage was saying that it was about equivalent to a guild group in fire for AAexp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
   Did the Firepits last night and got 2 of the FT3 shields, 2 necks, and a 66 and 68 rune.  Anyone know where the Kyv Heartpiercer that is the PH for the other named spawns in the version of firepit with the lvl 61 trash ?<br />
<br />
   Murkglider is easy because both PH's have unique names. In the other 2 expos one of the named PH's shares its type with a bunch of other mobs in zone so is hards to find. Kyv Heartpiercer for Firepits and Girplan Mover over for watering hole so they are harder to find, and also the nameds are in different locations in the different level expos.</div></div><hr />

68+ Watering hole.  If you know where Dragorn Quickblade pops in the lower level expedition, that same hallway, all the way on the east side, near the east-south turn,  there's two girplans, one that wanders east-west, and a static that's in a room with a discordling.  The static is the ph.<br />

Greaves seem common, leather tunic is a bit more rare.</div></div><hr />

at the time these were selling for 100k,now 50,</div></div><hr />

Usually, I would say one out of three is a named.  If you have cleared 3 cycles and have not seen a named, some recommend that you quit the expedition and start a new instance.  I have very rarely gone more than 3 cycles without seeing at least one named when keeping both PHers cleared.<br />

I have only done the 65-67 versions of these instances.  The rune rates were greatly reduced in the patch a week or two ago in these levels of instances anyway.  We used to get runes off of every 3-4 out of five named.  Now we are lucky to get one rune out of seven named spawns.  IN my last two 5-6 hour sessions, we had one rune in 8 named spawns, and two runs in 9 named spawns.  This is clearing both PHers as they spawned.</div></div><hr />

What is the second PH?  I know about the static spawn and roamer Girplans...is there another one I should be clearing?</div></div><hr />
