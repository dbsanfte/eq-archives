<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oulurok</div><div class="date">05-26-2003, 03:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am a Rallos Zek worshiping warrior with 15k to spend on upgrades.  I'm not good at the equipment part of the game as you can tell from looking at my profile in the sig.  I'm looking for the optimal upgrades I can do with that amount of money to maximise my ac, hps, and resists.  Any suggestions will be welcome.  Thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Minowara</div><div class="date">05-26-2003, 03:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would try to get some Thurg / SS from either a raid or buying the MQ to upgrade all your crusty / cobalt. Thurg typically goes for 1k a pice, and SS for 2k a piece if you can find the right people (Not including Bp / Legs). If you don't have faction or whatever, buy some fierce heraldic, however, it might be alittle more pricey then you want to spend. For your weapons I would get a frostbringer, I think it would greatly help you get aggro under control: it is one of the most underrated weapons out there. I would replace the couger claw earrings with orc fang because of the raw 15 hp on each one (and cheap cost). The rest of your equipment is good for your level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbo Baggins</div><div class="date">05-26-2003, 04:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">sell helm arms and boots. buy thurg helm ss arms and boots. next if you can sell legs and buy champs legs (3k on TM dunno about your server) theres about 7k now the other 8k. crystal spider eyes clattering bone neck, 35hp 2 ac earrings (X2).<br />
<br />
good quests (ss faction)<br />
bracer of benevolence X2<br />
draconic pauldrons.<br />
that stuff combine should be 10k (matters about leg price)<br />
suggestion would be to get a frostbringer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">weoden</div><div class="date">05-26-2003, 04:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">you look to be an ogre because your stats look really good.  Anyway, I would think seriously about an rbg or similar haste type upgrade.  At that point, you can get cob boots and gloves if you get an rbg.<br />
<br />
I like granite imbued spalders.<br />
death mask of elysians.<br />
Idol of thorned(maybe 10k range so just beware) or a bow with stats.<br />
Frost bringers are nice and I used to use a venous axe of the velium brood.  Both have some ac on them and nice procs.<br />
<br />
Then I would look at Fierce Heldaric as the last armor upgrade.  Try to get all the parts and poke around for smith.  You can probably get a discount on the armor if you can provide some or all the materials.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oulurok</div><div class="date">05-26-2003, 06:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am an Ogre.  I am also in what must be the smallest guild on my server {Bertox}.  <br />
<br />
Death Mask of Elysians is ~3500<br />
Idol of the Thorned is ~2200 (can probably farm this)<br />
Crystal Spider Eyes are ~900 (can probably farm this)<br />
Clattering Bone Necklace is ~5k (don't know where this drops)<br />
Frostbringer is ~7k<br />
<br />
I will definately look into the prices I can get for MQ's I had just assumed they would be alot.  If they are close to the prices suggested then that may be the way I go.  I will have to work on faction and I'm not looking forward to that.  I don't usually have trouble with holding agro with the weapons I have now unless I get bad hit rolls early and chanter tash's or shaman slows.  I have been wanting a frosty for a long time though, as well as the clattering bone necklace, but they were very expensive.  I've only got a little over 30 days played, so all my time in game has gone toward exp grinding and not farming cash or drops.  I really want level 60 and might stick with what I have til then, then farm Seb or something.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the suggestions, keep em coming if you have more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">weoden</div><div class="date">05-26-2003, 08:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the mask comes from umbral planes off a named undead in the far back end.  a frostbringer can be quested.  You need a dragons head from western wastes and excellent gaint faction in kael.  I do not know where the necklace drops but there is a nice neck piece that drop in WW as well.  its 7 all stats/ac and some amount of hp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">05-26-2003, 09:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Necklace drops in the grey off a named skelly - also drops bone handled scimitar I think.  Think he spawns north of the Scarlet Desert zone-in, but if you really want to camp him have a check on allakhazams or something first.<br />
<br />
Wandering named in the grey seem to be snapped up pretty quickly by the druids that hang out there so you might want to take a tracker with you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oulurok</div><div class="date">05-27-2003, 10:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did a PC for SS plate arms and boots MQ on my servers auction channel and got 1 response for boots at 5k.  Does this seem high or could it just be my server?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Minowara</div><div class="date">05-27-2003, 11:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I bought MQ of SS helm / gaunts fer 4k total a few days ago....prolly your server or I just happened to buy the parts that sell cheapy. Either that or the wizard I found selling was feeling reeeeeeally nice that day....:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BabaHanz</div><div class="date">05-28-2003, 01:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't know what prices are like on your server, so I'll just use my server (Torv) as an example.<br />
<br />
You have 15k.  Sell your SCHW (3k) and Putrid Belt (8k).  Now you're at 26k.  Buy Skyshrine Gloves (4k) and FBSS (2k).  You still have 20k, plus you'll already have more ac/hp than what you had.<br />
<br />
Next buy two Fierce Heraldic Bracers at 5k each.  This leaves you with 10k.  Idol of the Thorned (2k), Skyshrine Boots (4k), and Steel Wrapped Leggings (27ac 45hp 4svall) at 4k.  Now you're broke.  But wait, there's more.<br />
<br />
Quest some Draconic Pauldrons and an Eyepatch of Plunder.  This leaves you in pretty decent shape, except for agro weapons.<br />
<br />
You might want to consider selling the GCM (3k) and buy a Black Blade of Tormenting and Barnacle Covered Axe, or possibly questing that 8/22 with stat debuff proc in Seru.</div></div><hr />
