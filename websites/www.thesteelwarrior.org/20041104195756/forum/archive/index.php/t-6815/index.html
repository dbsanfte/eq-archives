<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Deschane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all, first time posting.. just made 65 yesterday, thought I'd ask some advice on  equipment upgrades. Not much access to large raid forces, mostly 2 or 3 group things at best. Looking for decent haste at the moment, though advice on any of the gear would be appreciated. Thanks in advance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You could try for a pair of LDoN greaves; or Kizrak's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">tactics is your friend ... i can think of a plethora of 2-3groupable bosses (not counting VZ) who drop good stuff.<br />
<br />
anival drops a heavy tooled weapon belt and ornate greaves<br />
the tallon zek side guy drops the earing 85hps <br />
the guy at the back of the zone drops the black plated collar (very nice)<br />
<br />
if you have very talented strong friends you can also do vz with anywhere from 6 to 18 people.  his scimitar would be a healthy upgrade aggro/dps/statwise .... and his necklace is 100hp and 18 to all saves with some stats.  his belt is ft3 ... but it also 100hp.<br />
<br />
i wouldnt roll against any casters in my guild for the belt ... and maybe the neck (not sure on that one yet), but if you have strong alts/friends, then farming him is pretty easy to do for personal interests.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Deschane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks for the advice.. will try tactics out, need to snag the raiders sometime in storms for the flagging, went there the other night.. does anyone know.. is the desert bugged? I went and  saw no rock storms or scorpions.. or did they just remove them from the desert?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Malek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Wandering mobs in the desert get stuck in one of the rock formations near the center of the desert.  Turn the volume up, walk along the wall till you can hear them, and AE taunt them out, just be ready to hit /fortitude or you're in for an ass whooping.  From there just outrun them, they're slow, and /camp and come back.</div></div><hr />
