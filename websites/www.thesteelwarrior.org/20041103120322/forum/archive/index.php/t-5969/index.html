<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Seraz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey everyone, how many of you have killed Gaukr Sandstorm, ST mob in BoT and dropped Ornate Greaves mold?? I've killed him 29 times (yes i've counted) and he has never dropped them. This is pissing me off!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kunis Marfury</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">killed him too many times...<br />
<br />
i think it's just a urban legend now :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Marduka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Killed him a for sure 20+ times. Never dropt it tho. I think its damn ultra rare or they removed it already and people belive in the legend :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Duchess Inferna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Not removed they dropped couple of days ago.  I have seen them drop maybe 4 times.<br />
<br />
Winning the roll is another matter as I am 0-4 on them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">just shows how sucky the randomness of loot</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Buuhmann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">killed all BoT wingbosses ~35 times, got only one silk legs :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Barja Bardagi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've kill Gaukr a lot, dropped 5 Legs.  Lost 2 to mages, 1 to a necro, 2 to Wizards, and I forget the last, but he was a dress-wearer too....<br />
<br />
And they wondered why I rolled on the Glyphed Rune Word one time....<br />
Turned it in, and sold C5 for an obscene amount. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Fenring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've killed them all dozens of times and I've seen one staff drop off Laeff and that's it, a few runes but who cares about spells :P<br />
<br />
I hate being in a good mid sands group and someone says hey Gaukr's up lets go kill him, as if it's worth losing your camp for that crap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grendonbb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">heh you'd be better off spending the time LFG for pickup raids to take down gods to get solro tower flagged than you would be takin down Guakr for greaves.. and I'm almost serious.<br />
<br />
Best I can tell, the drop rate is so absurdely low, it is not worth hoping for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Azaza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'm thrilled if he drops anything better than common vendor trash loot on top of the spectral parch and ring of torden.<br />
<br />
Since more than half the time he drops vendor trash, I almost dont even feel like wasting the time killing him. Almost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Poohjure</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Was on one night a few months ago and saw some friend in DS of BoT, so i went and just beat on thier mob for them. <br />
<br />
Well, Named pop.  I let the groups MT tank him even though my gear was MUCH better then his cause it was his group.  Well, he died, then cleric stopped healing outta panic i guess so I died.<br />
<br />
We regrouped, this time I did the tanking.  What do ya know, Plate legs drop.  I roll and win with a roll of 22222 (yeah i remember that for some reason).  He throws a fit even though he lost the roll.<br />
<br />
So i loot then we head to West named, I tank, and what do you know...Silk Legs drop, hot damn.  Only one silk in group so went right to the chanter.<br />
<br />
After that, I knew we were on a roll, 2 legs on 2 named, in one night, rare.  We head to Oreen, and he also has legs.  Was absolutely obsurd.<br />
<br />
That night was the first time I had ever killed DS named and it dropped legs, but Since that night, I have not seen a SINGLE set of legs drop off of any BoT Mini.<br />
<br />
--Pooh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Abividad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Was insanely lucky. Second time we killed Gaukr legs mold dropped. Group was even cool enough to NBG, so was between me and g/f's Cleric. Was a much bigger upgrade from her Moktor legs than from my sta augmented Helanic Tundra, so she's the proud bearer of Legplates of Vengeful Fury. Have not had anything but spec and ring drop since</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Naralli_VoLS</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I killed Gaukr about 20 times and saw Legs 5 times ( this was very early in POP release when the drop rate of items is higher to whet the appetites of us players ).<br />
Since I lost the roll on them in all 5 cases to non plate wearers I no longer participate in &quot;farming&quot; Gaukr.<br />
On the other hand, it did take me 68 Eindride Icestorm tries before I got my great blade of Storms.<br />
:PPP<br />
