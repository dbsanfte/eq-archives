Im trying to get advice on buying a EQ-friendly laptop/notebook pc. Ive read the recommended specs for memory, vid card, blah blah blah on the station/sony website. Id kinda like to hear from a computer geek who can tell me what to get verbatum. Ive looked at the cyberpower xplorer series. 1gig ram, 9700 vid card, amd 64 3400 processor. Is this adequate for EQ now and in the future? Somebody steer me in the right direction if ya' can, Ive got a pretty pwn warrior sittin' gettin fat while i hash this out. HELP! IF you wanna get advanced shoot me a line at Hepatsus@msn.com - Thx and again i apologize if i posted this in the wrong forum.</div></div><hr />

Your video card will be fine to make EQ2 playable and enjoyable, but don't expect to have  all the options turned up to max (but then again, I've heard people with 256mb 6800 GTs complain of not being able to, either - and they say its not because their comp/ram/vid card can't handle it (because it should be able to) but because EQ2 is coded ineffeciently)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mizuchi</div><div class="date">11-29-2004, 11:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I saw those Cyberpower ads in game magazines and I've ordered from them before, a few years back. They make fine computers. I've since sold my desktop and moved on to use primarilty laptops.<br />
<br />
I'm using a 10 month old 1400 USD laptop right now and I'm able to 2 box in OoW np. Load times in OoW are a little slow at 30-45 seconds while 2 boxing, but I still beat others. My laptop's stats are P4 2.4 GHz, 1 GB RAM, 60 GB 5400 RPM HD, Radeon 9600 Mobility (M10) with 64MB VRAM and wide screen. Playing EQ at 1280x800, old models (except for male barb for my shaman's mount), sound on for both instances, clip plane at least 3 &quot;clicks&quot; out, high qual texture, mip map on, dynamic lights on, social animation off, texture compression off, texture caching on, spell particles self only, and shadows off.<br />
<br />
Yours should be able to do the same without a doubt. If you try to set all settings at their max, I'm sure that it'll bog down, since top end desktop cards will also bog down. Shadows seems to be the worst one. I like to save memory where I can.<br />
<br />
The thing is with laptops is that you must watch the temperature. Go slow and allow your laptop ease it's way into working hard. If you load it too hard all at once, you risk overheating it. It may suffer damage before it's failsafe devices kick in. Also, you cannot upgrade laptops... I've junked one so far, which only lasted a year. This one, I'm hoping, lasts a bit longer. It's sad to throw away good equipment, but that's what happens when you try to push them too hard.</div></div><hr />

When you see a $270 AMD 64 3500+ outpreforming a $1000 3.6 GHz P4EE in a lot of games you know that Intel has some work to do.  <br />
<br />
That laptop should run EQ1 in it's sleep, and the video card is a little low end but it can probably run EQ2 as well.</div></div><hr />
