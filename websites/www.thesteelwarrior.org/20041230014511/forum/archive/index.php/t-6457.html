<br />
delay of weapon/1+(% haste/100)= hasted delay<br />
<br />
Ex<br />
20 delay/1+(60% haste/100)=hasted delay<br />
<br />
20/1.60=12.5 hasted delay.<br />
<br />
<br />
My question is how is slow calculated. Is it done in the same manner ? I read another thread where slowed warriors used Eartshakers to AOE. They slowed to increase proc rate and then rampaged. Nice strat I might add. Just for number crunching I am not sure how slow is calculated.<br />
<br />
<br />
Another quick question. I have read this somewhere but cannot find it. The  delay on a weapon represents the amount of swings per min. Anyone have the calculation for that ? I think a 20 delay weapons swings 30 times per min where as a 30 delay swings 20 times per minute but not positive. Another way to say it is delay 10 equals 1 sec real time.<br />
<br />
Calc would be <br />
(60/delay) x 10 = swings per min.<br />
(60/20 delay) x 10 = 30<br />
<br />
If this is incorrect please let me know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">03-31-2004, 08:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">60% haste would take a 20 delay weapon to 14 delay.<br />
<br />
Here's how it works:<br />
<br />
100% haste doubles the amount of attacks you make which means that your weapon delay is cut in half.<br />
Half of 20 delay is 10<br />
60% of 10 is 6<br />
20 - 6 = 14<br />
<br />
To get 12.5 delay you would need 75% haste.<br />
<br />
Edit: <br />
<br />
Yes, with a 20 delay weapon you will swing 30 times per minute with your main hand.<br />
<br />
60/2 = 30<br />
60/3 = 20<br />
<br />
I wouldn't look at it in swings per minute though as most mobs die in about 30 seconds or less in xp groups.<br />
<br />
2nd edit: (I really need to answer questions in one post :D)<br />
<br />
If a mob has a delay of 30 and you cast 75% slow on it then it generates 75% less attacks on you.<br />
<br />
30 delay * 1.75 = 52.5 delay<br />
<br />
So where as haste will double your amount of attacks at 100%, slow will halve your number of attacks at 100% (don't think it's possible to slow more than 75% at this time)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frig Coldheart</div><div class="date">03-31-2004, 08:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the info Payn</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gront</div><div class="date">04-01-2004, 04:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm afraid I don't agree with your numbers, Payn.<br />
<br />
You say that a 20 delay weapon, 60% hasted, is 14 delay (that is, swings every 1.4 seconds).  Your formula is (delay - ((delay / 2) * (haste/100))).  <br />
20 - ((10/2) * (60/100))<br />
20 - (10 * .6)<br />
20 - 6<br />
14<br />
<br />
I say that a 20 delay weapon, 60% hasted, is 12.5 delay (that is, swings every 1.25 seconds).  My formula is (delay / (1 + (haste/100))).<br />
20 / (1 + (60/100))<br />
20 / (1 + .6)<br />
20 / 1.6<br />
12.5<br />
<br />
Well, let's look at that.  A 20 delay weapon, unhasted, swings 30 times per minute.  With 60% haste, it should swing 48 times per minute (30 * 1.6).<br />
<br />
48 swings per minute is 1.25 seconds per swing, or a delay of 12.5.  Not 1.4 seconds per swing, or a delay of 14, as predicted by your formula.  A delay of 14, in fact, with a swing every 1.4 seconds, gives only 42.9 swings per minute, or a haste of only 43%.<br />
<br />
Look at it a different way.  Your formula can be simplified mathematically as follows:<br />
delay - ((delay / 2) * (haste/100))<br />
delay - (delay * haste)/(200)<br />
((200 * delay) - (delay * haste))/200<br />
(delay * 200 - delay * haste)/200<br />
(delay * (200-haste))/200<br />
<br />
Notice that at haste = 0, this gives the original delay (as expected).  And that at haste = 100, this gives 1/2 the original delay (also as expected).  But at haste = 200, this gives a weapon with zero delay.<br />
<br />
200% haste does not make your weapon have zero delay.  It makes your weapon have 1/3 the delay it originally had, so you swing 200% more.<br />
<br />
Now, plug 200% haste into my formula.  (delay / (1 + (haste/100)))<br />
<br />
delay / 3<br />
<br />
Which is exactly as predicted.  I believe the original poster had the correct formula.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kamidari</div><div class="date">04-06-2004, 01:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The slow calculation above isn't accurate.  As it is in EQ, 100% slow means you'd never swing.  The calculation is delay/(1-slow%/100), so for 75% slow with a 30 dly weapon, you're looking at a new effective delay of 30/(1-.75) = 30/.25 = 120</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">04-06-2004, 03:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Slow over 100% is bugged.  Take Spirit's Touch which is decrease attack speed by 120%, so you should have negative delay.  However you can definitely swing your weapon more often than once in forever with Spirit's Touch on.  From an eyeball point of view it looks like slow &gt; 100% is treated as if the 100 part isn't there, so 120% slow = 20% slow.  I wouldn't be surprised if 100% slow is bugged even though I can't think of anything that slows you by exactly 100% offhand.<br />
<br />
90% does work though (Storm Comet or High Priest in CoD).  When I have it on people thought I was afk, even though I'm really not (but might as well be).  With a Vanazir, I can swing once every 38 seconds!</div></div><hr />
