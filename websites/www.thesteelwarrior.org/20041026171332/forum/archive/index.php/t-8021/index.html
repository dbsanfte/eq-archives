<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>dairen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">anyone else noticed bugs in Iqthinxa's melee? Wouldn't have noticed anything but I died to a massive hit that i've never seen before.(melee hit not proc)<br />
<br />
<br />
Min hit - 463 ( yes this is a hit and not a kick)<br />
next min hit 537<br />
max hit - 4672<br />
also took 3747 3007 once a piece as well.<br />
<br />
#s may vary slightly as I only have 5% shielding.<br />
<br />
now the difference in the 2 bottom hits is 74. But the difference in max and min hits is 4209. Given the 20 interval formula for DI - max and min hit should vary by 19*74 or 1406.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The goat is zoo has a separate DB/DI for riposte hits and regular hits.  Her normal hits max at around 1800 (your mileage may vary due to shielding) while riposte can go quite a bit higher.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">must be that damn overpowering whip</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dubb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Did you check around the goat for a super salt lick?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Seriously, the few times I've taken dmg from Iqthinxa (as a rogue), it's usually around 4400+</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>XAclylospradaX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've seen this too, not only on Iqthinxa, but on one of the 3 animals that spawn with her (turtle).  <br />
<br />
<br />
Today was a 3k+ hit, we(guild) brushed it off as if the mobs was putting out more dmg if your back was turned to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mistiv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">dont know why you would think it is a bug!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">dont know why you would think it is a bug!<br />
<br />
because mob normal domage follows the Formula : DM = DB + Floor(  Random(20) * DI * mod(Class) )<br />
mod(Class)=0.95 if warrior, 1 else<br />
thus with the two min hits on a warrior being 463 and 537 we get DB=389 and DI=78 thus the max NORMAL hit is 1949 for a non warrior non disced class and 1871 for a non disced warior.<br />
But this is only for normal domage, it's different for special abilities.<br />
<br />
Normally ripost is not a special ability, does it share the same domage table. But as Phantron answered, this mob use a diferent domage table for riposte. which, when we look at the domage difference, is quite a burden because the ripost domage seems to be more than the double of a normal hit, making spiked round even more spiky :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dubb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Not trying to sound rude, but would you prefer they just put Chaos Runes in everyone's bank account the instant they get Qvic access?<br />
<br />
This is already too easy (and too many hp). It's like Vex Thal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I didn't mean to say that theese mobs are hitting to high, just that the risk of a deadly rispost is at max because the difference between normal hit and ripost is very high. if normal max hit would have been 3500+ and max ripost 4000+ I would have just said &quot;pay attention&quot;.<br />
but this setup of domage force the CH rot to be ready for a 4400 max hit distribution, and thus the heals are even less efficient and it force the casters to /stopcasting more often.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Mistiv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">i was just saying that dont automatically look at something different as a bug! no flame!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Quarm ripostes for 300, and hits for 3800.<br />
<br />
Super Goat hits for 2000 , and ripostes for 4500.<br />
<br />
Nothing really surprising :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Just don't attack if you're running low if you're that paranoid.  It's perfectly fine to heal as if she hits for only 2000.</div></div><hr />
