<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greyslayer</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 11:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hedge Event is fun I like doing it even though it can suck sometimes.  I would recommend 2-3 60+ Clerics and 2 60+ Chanters including an extra chanter/bard to deal with Thelin.  Also before every spawn room I would recommend mezzing Thelin killing the werewolf in the room before letting him go.  <br />
<br />
Just remember the waves go from 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 mobs so it gets hectic once about 4+.  With my old guild our MA died everytime on Wave 4 and up :D.  Some say there if you take to long you have to deal with 8 mobs at once not sure if that's true or not.<br />
<br />
The Boss guy Construct of Nightmares can wipe you if you aren't ready for him.  Hits for 1184 Max is slowable which needs to be done asap.  Once Thelin steps into the Fountain the boss spawns and agros him he needs to be mezzed and MA needs to get agro.  Also make sure you rotate him around the fountain in the fountain because if he gets outside good chance you all agro the 4 birds that stand against the walls or you could always kill them first :)  <br />
<br />
That's about all the info I remember after you kill the Construct have someone loot the Dagger Piece and give to Thelin once he is unmezzed and memblurred.  He will run out of the fountain and the hottie with no mouth will spawn and they will talk.  After she despawns hail Thelin for your PoNB Flag :).</div></div><hr />

AE taunt chained with defensive/evasive is just about perfect, though a very high AC/HP SK can draw unaggroed mobs with wave of enfeeblement. <br />
<br />
The Construct of nightmares may have a huge max hit, but he's also very easy to mitigate and evade at 1400+ AC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wudedorm</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 01:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">no one has mentioned you might want to think about having a monk keep Thelin leashed while fighting. He tends to want to wander off once you are killing a pile of mobs then you either need to catch up to him quickly before he dies or tag and blur him.<br />
The waves of mobs happen generally in each corner after you kill the single mob and Thelin begins to leave suddenly more spawn(normally immeaduiatly heading straight for nearest Cleric or enchater). As MA I have tried sitting in room once mob dead to pull them to me unsucessfully, so now i just stand in middle at 8% of single waiting on pop.<br />
We always just mez Thelin and pull the 4 birds in last room, I dont like being confined to small area worrying about if someone steps to far agroing adds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gallerus</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 02:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">most critical advice is to have an enchanter CoD him + then cast sow on him before you start otherwise you will be there like 2 hours.<br />
<br />
Thelin is turd &amp; dont have a lotta aas, hence no run3</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is the best advice on this thread. All of the mobs pop in the MIDDLE of the room, and you will find out quickly when it is about to happen.<br />
<br />
Have two tanks stand in the middle, don't let anyone else agro them,  each one takes a mob and the remainder get mezzed while people assist.<br />
<br />
Use Disc if your tanks are not super strong, just always make sure all other people are on the walls of the room, and the tanks are in the middle, and you will be fine.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azeroke</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 04:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did it twice with my guild recently and we only had one enchanter available.<br />
<br />
We just had each group setup with a good tank and healing power. Had the enchanter basically keep an eye on thelin, mez'd him whenever the mobs spawned to keep him out of the fray. Kept him mez'd if we had to rebuff or med. Only had to do that a couple times.<br />
<br />
Basically just offtanked everything. Worked fine if your tanks are smart enough to work together and split apart the mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vigdis SangCaru</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 04:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Couple things.<br />
<br />
1.  You NEED to keep Thelin alive.  Just before a wave he will bend down to pick up a dagger.  That is the signal to the party that mobs are about to spawn.  Folks need to jump on the mobs asap or they will beat on Thelin.  As someone else mentioned, the number of mobs gets progressively larger until the final wave of 7.  Note that they do NOT always spawn right near Thelin.  Sometimes they specifically spawn on the other side of the little space (aka, near where the healers are watching usually). <br />
<br />
You need good crowd control.  If you can swing it try to bring two enchanters.  One will be relegated to mezzing/blurring Thelin during the combat so he doesn't wander off and doesn't draw any agro from the mobs you are fighting.  The second will be in control of mezzing the adds (unless you prefer to off-tank them; that is what my guild often does just because they are all show offs).   Dazzle works for Thelin.  It also works for some, but not all, of the mobs. <br />
<br />
If your tank has AE Taunt, I'd recommend he hit defensive and blow it on the final wave and not wait for the boss.  Couple reasons.  First, he'll probably get it back by the time you actually engage the boss.  Second, that final wave is just plain NASTY on the CC and healers until its locked down.  An AET will give the chanters the necessary time to hopefully lock adds before they start jumping clerics. <br />
<br />
2.  It takes a LONG time to get to the first wave in the maze but the distance between waves gets progressively shorter.  <br />
<br />
3.  You CAN clear the construct room of mobs before you engage him.  The construct does not spawn until Thelin enters the final construct area (near the water-thingy).  If your chanter mezzes Thelin outside the room, the rest can pull the four mobs and kill them separately.  Then the chanter blurs Thelin and lets him start the event. <br />
<br />
The maze can be long and boring.  But the first time through is always fun I think.  G;'luck!</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can get the pre-flag later and then go unlock the hedge maze flag at the seer.  We had someone do it last night</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gabriel</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 09:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did it last night!!!  Thanks Guys for letting us tag along (Forlorn, SoC, LH)!  There were about half of us with no pre-flags.  All group leaders need to be pre-flagged though.  If not, he wont let you in.<br />
Had a blast, unfortunatley I was the only real tank (60 no AA's) so they let some damn Pally do it (great guy ;-0)~), he was 65 100+ AA's, did almost as good as I would have tanking......  Anyways, we had 2 or 3 chanters and they kept everything mezzed well, funny thing was, when the mobs spawned they would all go for my wife's warder (61 BL) and wax him.  Dunno why they did that, but happened they last 3 waves.  (Last one he lived through).  But anyways, with one solid and one semi-solid tank and a shit load of DPS we did fine (several rogues 65).<br />
Good Luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">QuirtEvans</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 10:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We let a pally tank all the trash mobs, then have the warrior go defensive on the construct.  That works pretty well.<br />
<br />
I've done the hedge when the trash mobs go straight for the chanter.  Dead chanters are not good when you are trying to get six mobs mezzed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abynormal777</div><div class="date">10-16-2003, 11:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for all the responses - we're doing the event tonight.<br />
<br />
A couple more quick questions based on what I've read...<br />
<br />
My guild is fairly small and we've only got 1 enchie (no bards) in the guild, so I'm guessing we'll be doing a lot of off-tanking.   <br />
<br />
How well do you think a 61 warrior with 1250 ac, 6400 hp (raid buffed) and no AA's can off-tank in the last few rounds?  (guessing I'll be either 3rd or 4th tank in the order)<br />
<br />
Also, we're a little caster short (no wiz and 1 or 2 mages)...do you think dps will be an issue?  We do have a good number of 60+ tanks, a couple clerics and a couple druids with CH to help keep everyone alive while we beat on em.  (and a good 64 shaman)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greyslayer</div><div class="date">10-16-2003, 12:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Far as I remember all the mobs are lvl 60 don't have a huge amount of HP and hit for max around 500.  You should be just fine just make sure your chanter has his/her eye on Thelin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GorfinML</div><div class="date">10-16-2003, 11:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I tanked the Construct the time i did it, and while defensive was up 1 cleric had no problem keeping me alive(magelo was the same now as it was then)  when defensivve wore off, either  a cleric or shaman kept their big heal over time on me the rest of the time.  took about 4 minutes to drop him with a buncha under 60 toons</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Uukla</div><div class="date">10-17-2003, 06:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">if you have 1 enchanter, dedicate the lowest level shaman, or druid in a pinch, to get agro off the enchanter by spamming greater heal and superior heal on them, even before they take damage.<br />
<br />
Ive done this with one enchanter, and was the shaman doing it.  Basically its a force multiplier for the enchanter, because it keeps mobs that get proximity agro on the enchanter, OFF the enchanter, and on the healer.  Thats why you want the shaman, so they can take the beating from the level 60 mobs while the enchanter mezzes them.  Doing this, we had 1 death, and that was an int caster that wandered into the kill zone right before a pop.<br />
<br />
DPS wont be a concern really in success, the mobs all are slowable, and tank fine after slowed.  you may want to pull the birds from the fountain area to just corner him so all the melee can just wail away though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abynormal777</div><div class="date">10-17-2003, 10:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for all the advice!<br />
<br />
We did it successfully on our first try last night.:D   We only had 1 chanter and he was having bad LD problems (had to reboot a few times between fights) so we went slow.  We had the necro keep Thelin occupied to free up the chanter.  Had a few deaths (MA twice, couple off-tankers, and the shaman on the boss mob), but overall pretty smooth.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, and it was lots of fun.;)</div></div><hr />
