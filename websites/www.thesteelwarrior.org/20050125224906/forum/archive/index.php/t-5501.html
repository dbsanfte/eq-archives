<br />
Im a 44 Warrior here and I have about 28k to spend here.  At level 44 the weapons Ive been using, while sufficient in the lower levels are just not cutting it for me anymore in terms of damage and ability to hold aggro.  Right now im using a 9/18 Jade Mace with a 4str aug on it and a Venomous Axe of Velium Brood.<br />
<br />
Ive seen the CHoS going for 10k or so on my server and was probably going to pick up one of these for sure.  Only thing is I was wondering at what level does the hammer actually proc?<br />
<br />
If I get a CHoS for around 10-12k what would be a good complement for it if I have about 15k or so to spend.  I was looking at some orb of forgotton magic thing that had a 300 or so DD proc on it but im not sure.  Any suggestions from higher level warriors would be great.  I would prefer to have weapons that would more than likely carry me into mid 50's or higher.</div></div><hr />

<br />
and at level 55 go buy a greatstaff of thunder, theres another 40000000000000 threads here on it too; plus some people ( cough baadan ) who swear by them and plan to name their first offspring Gsot. <br />
