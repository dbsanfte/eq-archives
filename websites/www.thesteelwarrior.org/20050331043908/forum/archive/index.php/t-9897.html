<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neksnappa</div><div class="date">12-01-2004, 10:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey all, I've been browsing this section of the forums for a while now, but up until yesterday I had been playing a warlock as my main, and gotten him to 17. However, after 4 years as a tank in EQ, I just cannot cope with the fact that my warlock has armor ranging from 15-30 armor whereas a similar level warrior has 100+ in each slot. So, I rolled a warrior last night and got to level 10 before I had to log. So far, I love it.<br />
<br />
However, I've yet to duo/group with anyone, and am concerned about how well I will be able to keep aggro when I do. My voidwalker pet on my warlock had an ability that generated aggro, and it spams it every time possible. As a result, I could stack 3 DOTs, a few nukes, and do more melee damage than the pet does, and still not get aggro unless the aggro spell gets resisted. <br />
<br />
I don't really see any warrior abilities that would do the same as the voidwalker spell. Are there any abilities that are similar to stun/debuff/hate/incite things in EQ, that are great for keeping aggro? I know relying on dps for aggro can't work that well, since warrior dps seems fairly low compared to rog/mag/warlock/etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krowbar</div><div class="date">12-01-2004, 10:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Do the quest at lvl 10 to unlock defensive stance. Under defensive stance you have some goodies like taunt and sunder to generate aggro.  There might be more but I mostly play battle stance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">12-01-2004, 11:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Once you get defensive stance, its easier to hold aggro.  I mainly use it when I am tanking in groups.  Here are the abilites I use for getting and keeping aggro:<br />
<br />
Demoralizing Shout - AE attack debuf, can chain cast.<br />
Sunder Armor - Armor debuf, can chain cast, our main aggro ability.  imo this is the WoW warriors incite<br />
Rend - DoT that generates threat and rage.  works very nice when applied to multiple mobs<br />
Revenge - a counter attack that is pretty good aggro.  Becomes available after you block (like the shield block ability ;-)<br />
Taunt - good old taunt.  Works like EQ taunt. 10 sec refresh.  gets resisted a lot when the mob is higher level.<br />
Disarm - just got this so I've not used it much, but its decent aggro against mobs that use weapons.<br />
<br />
I'm not 100% sure how good the aggro is on stuns/interrupts but so far it seems decent.  So add Shield Bash to the above list if you use a shield (I do).</div></div><hr />

I wouldn't use it with a pickup group.  Battle stance at least gives you other options to compensate for your group's lack of aggro management.  <br />
<br />
Sunder Armor appears to be the highest aggro thing we can do and is usable in Battle Stance as well.</div></div><hr />

This should be the norm in any game...but, as we all know, rarely is.   :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

You can almost tell the new warriors from the warriors who played EQ (especially pre-incite) by how much bitching they do about aggro.  They want aggro lock and knights nerfed lmao.  Guess some things never change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">12-01-2004, 01:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I demoralize first on mutli mob pulls, then proceed to Sunder, and hamstring after that.  Sunder seems to have more aggro than anything else, and Hamstring isn't too terribly high, but I've seen mobs turn after a hamstring, so I toss it in anyway.  At the very least, the mob will walk slower away from me.<br />
<br />
Rend doesn't seem to do dick for aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kalidor1997</div><div class="date">12-01-2004, 01:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">defensive stance generates more threat.  Mouse over the stance button and it'll describe it a little.  My theory is that its probably somewhere between 15-20% more threat.  This is to counter the 10% less damage that you do because you are in defensive.  Now, add defiance, a talent that adds 15% threat when in defensive.  <br />
<br />
What it seems to me is sunder armors in defensive is one heck of alot more threat than sunder armor in battle stance.  If you hit taunt you are now dead even in threat with the rogue or mage....a single sunder would then propel you massively ahead of everyone else.   Often its enough for me to do this and then switch to another mob completely...first mob will stay on me long enough that'll it'll be dead before it switches.  You've also now been beating on a mob long enough that you'll keep it on the second as well.<br />
<br />
Taunt before you break sheep and open up with a sunder.  Blam, taunt is on you the entire time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Heleron</div><div class="date">12-01-2004, 02:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have yet to have any major problems holding aggro on Defensive stance.   Depending on the situation I normally charge in and then switch to defensive stance or just pull with my cross bow to get initial aggro and taunt/demoralize/revenge/shield bash.  Grant it, on elite fights I will switch back to battle to do some hamstring hits for those runners.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deurgeran</div><div class="date">12-27-2004, 03:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I Just started a warrior in WoW last week.  I noticed before coming ehre a Major difference when grouping when I was in defesnive stance.  Another Nicety is Bash ... Imagine .. a Bash that actually interrupts.  <br />
<br />
I am only lvl 18 right now, so My question is ... Dual weild or Sheild?   The Sheild's in WoW can be pretty bad ass.  Allready I have a shield that is +398 AC WITH stat's and a block rating of 6 .... I can't wait to see what the high end shield's are like.<br />
<br />
Another Question .... THunder Clap .. would it not generate nice aggro?  I mean a 10% slow with damage component SEEM's atleast like it would.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iskandar</div><div class="date">12-27-2004, 07:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">really it's a personal choice. dual wield is nice but it'll lower your overall accuracy by a bit, so you pretty much need a beastly offhander. also, when I tank in groups that kill mobs around my level, I always use a shield. always.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NinjaBurger</div><div class="date">12-27-2004, 08:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It just matters group by group.<br />
<br />
It SEEMS like I get better aggro with a 2h weapon , so I use that when I'm having problems, but 90% of the time, I'm using a shield.<br />
<br />
The 1000+ AC I get from a shield &gt; Extra DPS</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SabreOscar</div><div class="date">12-27-2004, 09:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dual Wield imo is just for flash when Im not tanking in a group.  I played around with dual Wield while I was soloing and I found that the mobs dropped faster but the beating I took from missing the Armor and the stats from my shield just wasnt worth the down time (use bandage, eat food, etc.).  <br />
I killed more efectively with a nice 1h and shield then DW.  I also bring out the 2h just to keep my skill levels maxed.<br />
<br />
As for the original topic, getting agro off a priest or any other class for that matter is hard if you are in Battle Stance. Mocking Blow (or something like that) just doesnt grab enough aggro and has the chance of missing and the recast timer on it just blows.  If you are going to do alot of grouping the Defensive stance is the way to go for aggro.  Just my 2c</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">12-28-2004, 09:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been able to hold aggro very well with the Whirlwind Axe (warrior quest axe).  Its slow but it hits soooooo hard!  The damage range is like 103 to 154.  It hits hard in friggin defensive stance with the 10% dmg reduction.  Big hits = big aggro and BIG rage generation.  Once you got the rage its all sunder armour and demo shout.  But you gotta be in defensive stance if you wish to hold aggro.  Battle and Zerk stances suck for that (good for dmg though).<br />
<br />
I tend to use sword+board when I'm taking a beat down, other wise the Axe is in use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daeos</div><div class="date">12-28-2004, 10:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mocking Blow (or something like that) just doesnt grab enough aggro and has the chance of missing and the recast timer on it just blows. <br />
<br />
Agreed. Mocking Blow (http://www.thottbot.com/?k=321) didn't cut it when I tried it grouping, but I also believe it doesn't actually generate agro (same with <br />
Challenging Shout (http://www.thottbot.com/?k=370)), it just forces the mob to attack you for six seconds or something silly if you actually hit (see links).<br />
<br />
I just recently started using a 125damage (28dps) 2hander, been doing so for about 5+ levels. Granted I haven't tried it in groups yet, I did a fury build for cleaving multiple mobs at once and have no problem holding agro even after my shaman two box steals it. If anything, mocking blow/AE taunt will fix anything you don't snag off big cleave/sweeping hits.<br />
<br />
One thing I did notice though is a higher damage slow 2h &gt; quicker low damage 2h (atleast in my situation). I couldn't hold agro for dick when I tried a 80 damage polearm even though it had a proc and 3 more dps (yes, both polearm/axe skills were maxed out when I was testing). I'm still pro-defensive for grouping, but seeing as how I don't group at all, 2h/fury works fine for me.<br />
<br />
Will be doing some testing in berserker stance, I'm curious if anyone has good experiences with it. I heard some people were going to town with whirlwind, but seeing as how I have maybe four actual berserker stance abilities it seems to be weak sauce for now. Any feedback on this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">12-28-2004, 10:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">'zerker rage is awesome for building up some quick rage.  plus you can still sunder so if you're getting a lot of rage, you can drop a gaggle of mob's AC quickly.  Of course Intercept is the chit when its up.  Gonna be even better when they fix the whole need 15 rage to spend 10 thang. I'm not high enough level for whirlwind or pummel yet.  If you are not MT then it is an awesome stance for damage dealing.<br />
<br />
Of course you gotta have Tatical Mastery talents inorder to utilize 'zerker stance very well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kokonut Pye</div><div class="date">12-28-2004, 01:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you have tactical mastery (which you should), and you're able to start off with charge, do that and then there are two things you can do. If your group tries to start attacking immediately and not give you any time to get aggro, fire off mocking blow and then switch to defensive stance, demoralize, and start sundering. If they're smart and wait two or three seconds to start attacking, just switch to defensive after charging and demoralize followed by sunder. If you're having problems with aggro, you might want to fire off a sunder first. Taunt if you lose aggro followed by a sunder if possible. Once you have aggro, if you have revenge talents I would recommend using shield block followed by revenge as much as possible, throwing in your other abilities every once and a while. Switch back to battle to hamstring if needed.<br />
<br />
If you can't start with charge, pull with your gun/bow and try to get enough rage to sunder as soon as possible.<br />
<br />
This is a very general guideline to follow, as each situation is different. I can use this strategy to hold aggro the majority of the time I'm grouped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">12-28-2004, 02:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mocking blow is shit.<br />
<br />
I didn't even buy the last upgrade I got to it.  It's not worth the gold.  Also, defensive stance is clearly more aggro than battle for sure.  if I switch into battle mid fight, I'll lose aggro a lot of the times, switch back to defensive and immediately it will come back.  Dunno what's up with that, but I've seen it happen a few times now.<br />
<br />
By the way, anyone have ANY fucking idea what slam is for?  I mean AT ALL?<br />
<br />
Heroic strike costs the same rage.<br />
Heroic strike doesn't have a cast time.<br />
Heroic strike does more damage.<br />
Slam does...uhh...nothing?<br />
<br />
It doesn't stun, it doesn't interupt..right now it's HS with a cast time from what I can see.  Am I missing something, or is it total crap too?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daeos</div><div class="date">12-28-2004, 03:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nah, I'm pretty sure you're right about slam, I didn't even bother training that shit.<br />
<br />
Heroic Strike (http://www.thottbot.com/?k=288) - Level 56<br />
<br />
Slam (http://www.thottbot.com/?k=343) - Level 54</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">12-28-2004, 03:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Slam is an extra attack doing weapon damage + whatever, not a +damage to next attack.  In theory the advantage is that it does weapon damage (use slow weapons) and also you don't lose one hit of rage generation like Heroic Strike since it's an extra hit.<br />
<br />
That said I have never played far enough to get Slam, and I'd assume it requires channeling and I can't imagine tanking while trying to get a channeling attack off to be very fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">12-28-2004, 03:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nah, I'm pretty sure you're right about slam, I didn't even bother training that shit.<br />
<br />
Heroic Strike (http://www.thottbot.com/?k=288) - Level 56<br />
<br />
Slam (http://www.thottbot.com/?k=343) - Level 54<br />
<br />
Slam does weapon damage + the listed damage, versus just adding X damage to your next attack.  It should always do more damage than Heroic Strike if you ignore the fact that it's got a casting time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">12-28-2004, 03:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">you aint swining while you're casting slam.<br />
<br />
weap damage + X hits tend to be lower than HS hits if you debuff the crap out of the mob.  HS adds damage on top of what you hit the mob for, so str, mob AC, atk power, etc., gets factored then the HS amount gets added on top of that.  So the damage varies a lot with HS versus a more set amount of damage with the weap dmg + X formula.<br />
<br />
where slam could out damage HS is if you are up against a mob that mitigates your melee damage down to next to nothing.  I havent tested it to much, but I'm pretty sure any weap dmg + X move (slam, cleave, MS) will out do any melee damage + X move in under that circumstance.<br />
if I switch into battle mid fight, I'll lose aggro a lot of the times, switch back to defensive and immediately it will come back. Dunno what's up with that, but I've seen it happen a few times now.<br />
that would be defensive stances extra 10% threat add per hit (per move?)  I'm not sure if its exactly 10% but its something like that.  By it self it is almost enough for aggro lock.  Toss in some talent points that give you 3% more threat per hit in defensive stance and its pretty fookin hard to peel mobs off ya at that point ;)  Not impossible, just difficult.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daeos</div><div class="date">12-28-2004, 04:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh, well if it's an extra attack all together I could see using it with slower 2handers. Mortal Strike is an extra attack also correct? May be a nice way to make up for weapon delay, 1.5 sec isn't that bad of a cast time if you just drop it after your swing. <br />
<br />
Guess I'll play around with it, I should have mortal strike soon also. I'm going to wind up in defensive once I start grouping anyway, but until then might be a good fyi.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">12-28-2004, 04:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mortal Strike is an instant attack, like hamstring or sunder, that does not interrupt your swings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daeos</div><div class="date">12-28-2004, 04:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yar, that's what I meant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">12-28-2004, 05:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Unless one of the two skill gets affected by armor and the other do not, the two skills both do constant damage improvement (Slam has a range, but average the damage done is a constant number).  It's a simple matter of comparing which number is higher for purposes of DPS.  <br />
<br />
Now I have no idea if Slam stops your swing timer or not, or how likely a warrior is to channel a 1.5s attack, and these factors can influence Slam vs HS one way or another.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daeos</div><div class="date">12-29-2004, 12:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tried slam out, was hitting for around the same amount as my heroics usually do. On top of that every time it tried to channel it was interrupted atleast once from me getting beat on, so it took twice as long to get the actual swing off. Awesome.<br />
<br />
I honestly didn't try it for an extensive period of time, I pretty much tried it for ten minutes before I was to irritated to put up with that shit anymore. If something is going to take me that long to get off, it might as well auto-crit, stun, slow, make me a sandwich, do just about anything usefull, but three secs for some extra damage you would do just by swinging normally is retarded.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, you have to stop swinging to cast slam.  <br />
<br />
Yes, it is fucking useless, near as I can see.  I do know one mob with absolutely ridiculously high armor that I could test the armor equation on, but I'd need a healer with me and slog thru a 1/4 of BFD to get to it, and I got better things to do with my time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">12-29-2004, 08:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ran down south of 1k needles and picked on a pather 6 levels above me to see if there was a difference between the two on mobs where you hit for next to nothing on.  Nope.  Neither slam nor HS care about the mobs level or AC, they we're bothing hitting way way harder than my melee on the mob.  150+dmg with HS or Slam versus 12dmg average with regular melee.<br />
<br />
There is only one situation I can see slam being effective: being a dps tank with a real slow 2h.  So warriors on raids will benifit from using slam with weapons that have big delay on them, thats about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">12-29-2004, 10:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">When I mean swing delay I mean like this, suppose your weapon has a delay of 4 seconds.  After you swing you cast Slam and say for whatever reasons it gets done casting after 3 seconds.  Do you have 1 second left until your next swing or 4?  That makes a huge difference so far as DPS is concerned.  If it's the former, then as long as Slam gets done casting before your next swing it's not a big deal because there is no way to do more DPS between swings anyway.  If it's the latter, then it's pretty much worthless while tanking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">12-29-2004, 10:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If it's the latter, then it's pretty much worthless while tanking. <br />
<br />
Oh, it's pretty much worthless while tanking anyway, since you can be interupted during the &quot;cast time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bong's right...additional DPS if you're not MT, and just happen to be using a fucking weighted axe for some reason.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">12-29-2004, 11:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Once you hit the mob with slam, its like you just turned attack on.  You do have to wait for the weapons full delay before it hits.  You can chain cast slam, so if you have a 3.6 sec delay weap (like the warrior quest axe) and you have the rage to chain slam then you'd be doing more damage than if you just swung the weap on its own.</div></div><hr />
