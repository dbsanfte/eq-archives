I think no one with half a brain will disagree with the fact that Warriors are out of balance.  It's only to the degree to which some of us disagree and maybe on how to fix it.<br />
<br />
But I feel that begging SOE for a Knight nerf followed by post after post of Knight bashing is not only going to hurt your valid point but also slow your cause.<br />
<br />
If Warriors would attempt to maybe slow the Knight bashing they would find that they might have some useful allies.  The more people Warriors have agreeing with their cause the better it is for the cause.<br />
<br />
Warriors, remember Knights had it bad NOT JUST for Kunark but pretty much until Luclin (I know I was there).  So trust me when I say any Knight who has played awhile feels your pain and most likly sympothizes with your cause to at least some degree. We realize it's hurting your exp grouping to an extent but at least you guys are still required for the vast majority of raids (Whats the last raid you were at that was called for lack of SK's?  :)  )<br />
<br />
I just think if we all slowed down a bit and stopped some of the mud slinging and bad info we maybe could have a much better chance at helping us all out when it comes to balance time (if it comes).<br />

(Although i do get a mite cranky on occasion :p ). I've spent a great deal of time looking at this issue and originally I also thought that balance could be achieved solely by boosting my own class. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, I cannot consider aggro lock which totally sidesteps the responsibility for casters to manage their power output, when the creator of that aggro is actively seeking it and there being only minimal differences in the cost of keeping that aggro seeker upright as anything other than broken. <br />
<br />
If the system wasn't nigh idiot proof, if there was a real trade off in mana and/or effort to attain it I might say something different. There is not. <br />
<br />
Obviously the emphasis is on knights because they are most similar to warriors in 'tanking profile' probably the 'correct' solution requires a massive overhaul of aggro across the classes but I can't see SoE being up to that.<br />
<br />
Many of my warrior brethren disagree with me and would be perfectly happy with changes to themselves only. I can't see it working with the game retaining any integrity. Probably one reason i've just about quit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Personally I don't think knights abilities need to be nerfed, I think it all boils down to knightemization. Knight gear should not have the same AC/HP/STA as warrior AND have WIS/INT/Mana on top of that. Stuff I can use should not be the same stuff a knight can use. <br />
<br />
Nobody's bashing knights unless they come here spewing nonsense.</div></div><hr />

[B]Warriors, remember Knights had it bad NOT JUST for Kunark but pretty much until Luclin (I know I was there).  So trust me when I say any Knight who has played awhile feels your pain and most likly sympothizes with your cause to at least some degree. Funny, through all the knight gimps coming in and claiming that warriors deserve to be screwed up like this, and many of them pulling Kunark card claiming that's the reason for them having easy play (and yes it is easy...all you need to bother with is getting more hp) while warriors are relegated to third rate tanks, I'm having a hard time finding the ones who understand the difference between a warrior tank and a knight tank.  You'd think them supposedly knowing how it feels being worthless would make them more likely to want to have them fix warriors sooner.  No one WANTS to be in this situation, I know you understand, yet most of the Knights who have come here seem determined to come up with reasons why Warriors should remain gimps except with a trained squad of people around them and 4 agro procs and /disc defensive on tanking one mob in the entire raid that requires a CH chain.<br />
<br />
   I go over to the Shadowknight board...I have rarely gone over there recently, because most of what I see are Knights content with their own superiority and not really caring what happens to others, even when it shouldn't be.  The Paladin board carries an ego that is worlds beyond anything I've seen.  I can't even read more then one single thread before their attitudes just disgust me.  It's gotten to the point where I'm so sick of the &quot;Knight-attitude&quot;, even tho I believe I probably had it myself at one time, that if Knights were nerfed back to Kunark I wouldn't have much sympathy at this time.  Maybe in a little while, but not if it happened now.<br />
<br />
We realize it's hurting your exp grouping to an extent but at least you guys are still required for the vast majority of raids (Whats the last raid you were at that was called for lack of SK's?  :)  )<br />
Furor, I know you answered this question before...</div></div><hr />

<br />
knights tanking quarm shouldn't happen at this moment, so either you boost the dps of those boss mob, or you nerf the knights, or you nerf the knightemization.<br />
<br />
Boosting quarm dps and other boss mob is in fact a nerf on all class, and you'd have to compensate on boosting warrior tanking ability, thus making warrior out of balance in xp group? So you'd have to boost all mob in the game according to the new warrior survivability, in which case you're back to all class except warrior being nerfed...<br />
<br />
Boosting one specific class while the other are remaining at the same point, is in fact a nerf to those class. Anyway you look at this, there are class vastly superior to others, and either you choose to boost a set of class or nerf directly the other, the result is the same : it's still a nerf to those class that are currently vastly superior.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The spark that got this fire really raging was series of posts on ArchOverseer's website, titled:<br />
<br />
Who Needs Warriors, Part I<br />
<br />
Who Needs Warriors, Part 2<br />
<br />
Who Needs Warriors, Part 3<br />
<br />
Who Needs Warriors, Part 4<br />
<br />
<br />
The point?<br />
<br />
It's being show that warriors are NOT still required for the vast majority of raids.<br />
<br />
Hence the reason for so much frustration, anger and calls for nerfs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hi, thanks for bringing that up. I do believe that my guild has the best record on LDoN raids serverwide as we have beaten Ruj Zerker, Valdoon, and Miragul's Synarcana - within the time limits/death counts - yes 30 whole points - and before anyone else (i.e. weeks ago to a month+ ago). Do you know why and how? Are you sitting down Madrone, this may come as a SHOCK to you. READY? Here's the secret. We have our Knights tank EVERYTHING. It's a LOVELY thing to have heavily armored tanks that can take hits, keep mobs aggro locked, buff and heal their groups, put out incredible damage, and myriad other utilities. Unfortunately, that means on specific raids, if requisite Knights are not online, we have to cancel. That's happened twice now. Sure makes me and the other warriors feel all warm and fuzzy inside.<br />

The war plead started out with &quot;FIX US,&quot; not nerf knights...<br />
<br />
But, absolutely NOTHING has happened to help the war cause. SOE has said the same bullshit time and time again, &quot;we're looking into it...&quot;<br />
<br />
So if SOE has no intention of fixing the war, the only logical step to put tanks back into balance is to nerf knights...Get it?<br />
<br />
Get on our bandwagon to fix the war class, and we'll stop bitching about the knight class needing a nerf...Well maybe some folks will.<br />

<br />
The sad truth is, wether ANYONE wants it or not, Knights, and other non-pure melee stand a good chance of being nerfed in the upcoming months. I'm sure that most Warriors would much rather see our class elevated and the end game elevated then to see others get dropped down a notch or two.</div></div><hr />

I still think Nerfing is not the way.  I think it would be a lot more exciting for Warriors to get a new ability(s) or some new off the hook gear or something to that effect.  But like you guys have stated, Nerfing is SOE's perferred method.<br />

In all seriousness.  What would you guys want nerfed in particular and I mean specifically?<br />

If you COULD have something about your class improved instead, specifically what would that be?<br />

Ok i'll bite . . . <br />
<br />
First thing I have to say, a lot of people are getting worked up over warriors calling for nerfs.  Let me spell it out for ya . . . it does not matter what we want or not, SoE is going to do whatever they want to do  . . . PERIOD.  Their aim is not to make me happy, but in their eye's balance the game.  Expect a nerf to BoV but that will probably be about all.  They might look at taunt they might not . . but basically don;t expect that warriors will be improved or knights nerfed.  I don;t find it particularly balancing but the again Absor stated things were pretty well balanced  and i have yet to see him recant of that . . . . EVER.<br />
<br />
Secondly if I was to nerf knights (and i really don;t want to) i would add in a margin for fizzles in all the aggro lock spells, and make them fail about as often as taunt fails.  I think aggro lock makes the game to trivial as a whole in the hands of any plate class.  Aggro ability should be balanced SK &gt; War &gt; Paly.  I'd like to see the hp and mitigation margin widen between knights and warriors, but I think that knight abilities now are where they should be.  This area is better handled by making the warriors better.<br />
<br />
Lastly warriors should get something (skills/disc's) between level 60-65 . . . there was some real reason we leveld up right??  SK/Paly heck even rangers got more than we did with PoP.  Disc's need to be looked at though, because no warrior uses anything but defensive (we have to keep it up and able to use 24/7 even if we are not MT)  Either make all the reuse timers 5 minutes or unlink them or something.  Weapons from PoP are very over due for an overhaul . . . . anything I get as a warrior a paly/sk can get something better.  Increase the output on the War only weapons (such as GSoT, etc)  and give us a few decent 1hs drops before we get to time.  Currently time level warriors have great aggro it's the 55 - 65 players not in time who have aggro issues.  Since we are so screwed they should offer them like the 60 - 65 spells turn in parchment i get nifty weapon with good aggro.  Guess i'd be pissed though i already spent my time gettting parchments and now i'll have to go back UGH!  As i said before warrior mitigation and hp's needs to be raised to a point where warriors are clear cut the best tank, but not so far we are the only tank.  See the difference between sha &gt; druid &gt; cleric healers.  That is how warriors should be with tanking ability.  I won;t make friends saying this, but SK &gt; Paly &gt; Warrior should be the order (i only put sk's last because they are more offensive, and pallis more defensive oriented)  I really don;t care about the order though just warriors should be the best at tanking period end of story.  Can a paly or sk tank sure, but a warrior should do it better, and tanking better for 3 minutes does not count.  Warriors should also have some means for generating aggro from a distance, either special warrior only arrows/bow (proc 0.0 stun 100% of the time) right click effect  . . . i don;t know; just something to generate aggro from a distance.<br />
<br />
that is all i can think of atm but generally how i feel anyhow.  Notice not a whole lot in the nerf department huh . . . to bad sk's will still flame us warriors as whiners . . . . then again i can label all sk's a pompus, arrogante fools too  . . . doesn;t matter though SoE still won;t fix the situation . . . guess i'll wait on the ultimate warrior patch . . . World of Warcraft</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then you realize you would have to increase Pal/SK fizzle rates across the board.  Sure some spells aggro better then others (and some too much), but all spells can be used for aggro.  I used to use heals, Flash of Light, root, etc...  A better solution is to remove hate from spells that do not affect a mob (except heals for obvious reasons).<br />
<br />
I also disagree with your aggro lineup.  For me it should be SK&lt;Pal&lt;Warrior.  Paladins should always have a step up in that department since we get aggro tools from both sides (if you think Paladins can aggro lock, ever consider what a Cleric could do if they wanted to?).  Howver, I do agree, aggro lock is bad for the game.</div></div><hr />

Howver, I do agree, aggro lock is bad for the game. <br />
<br />
If you remove the hate from stuns that makes a whole line of aggro weapons pretty pointless, as well as the yesheka augments (0.0 stun).  Adding a chance to fizzle on all spells would not be bad, and in fact if they just made taunt and fizzle rates match i'd be pretty happy.  I see casters fizzle a whole lot less than my taunt fails.  Sure this is subject to debate, but one thing we can agree on is aggro lock is bad for the game period.<br />
<br />
I knew not everyone would agree with the aggro lineup, but traditionally sk's have been the masters of aggro.  And believe me i love having an sk in my groups, he casts an aggro increaser on me and things work really nice.  Of course now people are starting to even question working with warriors and just replacing us altogether.  Paladin's tend to have a more defensive spell line up and sk's more offensive.  I don;t play either really so i am relying on others for that info so i could be mistaken.  At any rate I don;t particularly care what the line up is as long as the parent class is not totally abilterated by the 2 child classes.</div></div><hr />

I dunno ... aggroing a MOB with a spell the MOB is immune to makes 0 sense to me.  I'm glad that I can still use my Sarnak Warhammer to aggro 56+ lvl mobs, but I think that that reflects poor game design.  I'd applaud removing hate from spells where MOBs are immune, but at the same time I think aggro from resists should remain on par with landed spells.  (Actually for stuff like slows it makes more sense for aggro from resists to be &gt; landed IMO.)<br />
<br />
I'd re-gear what I needed to for aggro weapons (I do at least have the GSoT and SotB for 56-65 MOBs).  I'd work even harder for the Anger augs.  Knights would use spells which burn more mana to aggro MOBs, and would have aggro lock with a &quot;price&quot;.  At first blush, that looks like a much more balanced than what there is now.<br />
<br />
If I had a magic developer wand, I would do that ^^ (stealth nerf I s'pose, but not a huge one), and add some bonus utility to the warrior class.  Hrm ... start by re-working /shield so that it is no longer a targetted short timer trick (&quot;I /shield .. the Movie Geek!&quot;) but a combat stance parallel to defensive and aggressive.  I'd give it a cone area behind the warrior similar to the space in front for ripostes; lower the tanks DPS as a result to balance the ability.  An XP group would trade a high probability of aggro lock for a lower risk of the loss of aggro lock, and tank stacking would make even more sense (&quot;You aggro, I'll shield the panty-wai .... er, casters behind us&quot;).<br />
<br />
After that, I would re-examine discipline timers.  I can knock together a few models in my head less broken than the current one, but I keep toggling between what I want to see, so I'm gonna leave it at that ...<br />
<br />
I'd continue to move the game away from niche play to ... play.  Many players guard their niches protectively, and would howl at this.  But I have more fun getting 6 smart players of nearly any class lineup and going to it than I do spending 45 minutes trying to find someone of the _________ class.</div></div><hr />
