And you're absolutely right, these are not the official forums, nobody here likes legpulling / covert sabotage. You can do that all you want on the official wow boards.<br />
<br />
The rest of your post is similar nonsense, sorry to say.</div></div><hr />

I also play a warrior =P</div></div><hr />

<br />
After this last patch you shouldn't have a damn thing to bitch about shamans, windfury got fixed and frost shock snare component got put on the diminishing returns spell list, which ended up bugging FS because now the damage caused is also on a diminishing return.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trondir</div><div class="date">05-07-2005, 10:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">oh yeah?<br />
so shamans finally have a negative, serious bug to fight with... I have 10.<br />
<br />
<br />
they are still the only complete and finished class in the game really.<br />
<br />
<br />
 because now the damage caused is also on a diminishing return.<br />
and just to clarify on that, the first 3 frost shocks do full damage, but less and less movement slow. Only if it's immune to the slow component, the damage also fails<br />
<br />
but what moron nukes with frost shock when the movement effect wouldn't take hold anyways?</div></div><hr />

<br />
paladins just take forever to kill, by design.<br />
<br />
both classes can fuck you up pretty bad if they 1/2 way know what their doing (eventually in the case of the pally /giggle).<br />
<br />
Kinda like a well played warrior ;)</div></div><hr />

so shamans finally have a negative, serious bug to fight with... I have 10.<br />
<br />
By all means, lets hear about these 10 problems, does this list consist of...<br />
<br />
Shamans<br />
Mages<br />
Priests<br />
Hunters<br />
Rogues<br />
Paladins<br />
Warlocks<br />
Druids<br />
Other warriors<br />
<br />
If these are your problems then the 10th problem is obviously operator error. <br />
<br />
Now seriously, what is it about paladins that makes them seem overpowered? DPS? Surviability? Spells? Mana regen? If anyone else can add to this list please do so.<br />
<br />
I for one believe their DPS to be utterly crap, they've got the killing speed of a turtle. I say survivabilty to refer to them being able to wear plate and thus take less melee damage, this I don't have a problem with until I factor in their spells. Now their spells I really don't have a problem with, their DA in a sense gives me a DA, when their DA goes up I can bandage myself up and put some distance between us. &quot;But we're warriors, we're suppose to stay in melee range to open up a can of whoop ass&quot; Use your gun, bow or thrown weapons to inflict some damage, then intercept before they can close the gap for your own little stun against them. I hope I don't have to explain how overly annoying it is to be standing there stunned while someone is laying the smack down on me really is. Finally mana regen, I have a big problem with how fast they regen their mana in combat. The fact that they can start and end a fight at full health and half mana, to me, is overpowered.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">05-07-2005, 01:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Trondir, shut your piehole and listen up for a second.<br />
<br />
I fought a paladin for over 6 fucking minutes.  I used 3 potions during the fight.  Potions, by design, are only supposed to be used once a fight.  Ergo, we can determine that BY DESIGN, most fights SHOULD be over in under 3 minutes.  I wailed on this sonuvabitch for 6 goddamned minutes, using every trick I had in my books.   Was I bested by a paladin BETTER than me?  I would say not.  I would say that surviving on 4559 HP for 6 minutes against a class who is doing damage to me is pretty goddamned well skilled.<br />
<br />
I will however, say that he is my equal, no fucking doubt about that.  And being equally skilled, should NEVER result in me having to mount up and get the fuck out of dodge with 150hp left after 6 minutes because I would eventually end up using my entire stack of Runecloth to no avail.<br />
<br />
When was the last time that you...any of you...fought someone else for 6 goddamned minutes.  It doesn't happen in this game.  The fact that there is only ONE class in this game who can survive that long on a regular basis, with very little other than stun, heal, cleanse, DA, is fucking crap.  The fact that everyone claims that they do crap for damage is bullshit too.  A warlock does damned near zero damage to me before I kill him, and I don't see people claiming warlocks do crap damage.<br />
<br />
Spirit regeneration during combat sucks?  Well, lemme tell you, it doesn't suck enough to change the health bar on a paladin who's not being a consecration monkey.  When they spend their mana doing only heals and hammer of justice, they've got more than enough fucking spirit regeneration going on to keep themselves alive forever.<br />
<br />
Something needs to fucking change.  The fact that 50% of alliance play one fucking class should be a clue here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trondir</div><div class="date">05-07-2005, 01:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Haass, in order for the fight to last 6 minutes, YOU survived for 6 minutes as well. So much for the &quot;high dps&quot; paladins are supposed to have. <br />
<br />
Do you believe in rock - paper - scissors?<br />
<br />

you missed a (small) word there : bugs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Isk</div><div class="date">05-07-2005, 04:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hunters DESTROY paladins if they start at range. a priest can do a lot of nasty things to a pally regardless of how the fight starts. we can't.<br />
<br />
so, warriors have a difficult time against pallies. other classes don't. kinda like how we can pound mages, especially if we get the drop on them. it's not a big deal.<br />
<br />
also: shaman aren't so great in group pvp. they can still contribute but they're not as strong as they are in straight duels.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The fact that 50% of horde playes one fucking class should also be a clue, no?</div></div><hr />
