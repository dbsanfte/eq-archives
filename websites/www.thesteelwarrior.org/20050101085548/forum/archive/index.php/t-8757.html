<br />
A pretty decent 25% upgrade compared to our Ancient Chaos Cry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">09-03-2004, 04:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wonder if that's actually enough to move a mob by itself (assuming start on top of aggro list but no olead).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Timmok</div><div class="date">09-03-2004, 04:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guess would be no. Afaik SKs cant move mobs with their 600 hate Terror(http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3405&amp;source=Live)<br />
<br />
But maybe some of the SKs reading this board can fill us in.</div></div><hr />

No. It'll balance out the wizards nuking 25% harder compared to their ancent Fire DD, but that's about it. Terror of Thule didn't move mobs, and 5 bucks says neither Bazu Bellow or Terror of Inruku will move a mob on its own.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paen</div><div class="date">09-03-2004, 06:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I kinda like having to sit to move a mob after bellows, can ping pong stuff back and forth like 2 monks FD'ing back and forth as ghetto crowd control/splitting pulls. Guess we could still use an old incite to do this if new one did get enough agro to move a mob on its own though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arathena</div><div class="date">09-03-2004, 07:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I -believe- it's a function of how direct hate addition works, Paen, without also performing an action that's otherwise detrimental(or aggro inducing, sitting / proximity included) to the mob, it doesn't seem to actually check for changes to the hate list. I'm not 100% certain, that's just my gut feeling for how it works - Since Enraging blow is always attached to a melee round, and Incite lays down an icon effect, they're both different from Terror in important ways.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frodlin7th</div><div class="date">09-04-2004, 04:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's a 120hate cap on primary engagement.   Thus it's significantly more beneficial for one to have someone else engage, or to plink with an arrow then bellow on incoming mobs.  It's a complete waste of endurance to use bellow to pull, when you could acheive the same result by using the lowest level in the incite line.<br />
<br />
It always makes me chuckle when someone says a 120 hate/use upgrade is &quot;further gimping&quot; anything when of course, everyone around you is generating more hate as you level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">09-04-2004, 04:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Press the Attack will be a better pulling tool now anyway.</div></div><hr />

Thats nice to know, where did it come from though I've never seen anything even suggesting a hate cap for first attack. I usually use ton-po stars before hitting incite anyway since range is further, still nice to know though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frodlin7th</div><div class="date">09-04-2004, 08:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, it's been known for a while that direct hate doesn't give full aggro on initial pull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brael</div><div class="date">09-05-2004, 03:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Paen:  http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=3789 and http://www.shadowknight.org/forums/showthread.php?t=18154 are where you can find out that initial hate caps exist.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paen</div><div class="date">09-05-2004, 04:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I knew that proximity affected pure hate spells (and any hate generating spells / actions) and I knew that hate spells didnt seem to give full effect unless you were already on the hate list from some other hate inducing action.<br />
<br />
I had just never heard of the 120 hate cap anywhere before, I didnt realize it was an actual cap and not an arbitrary number relative to distance or something.<br />
<br />
Great thing to know though, especially after I just grabbed an effigy for range, gonna have to swap out neenja stars a lot it seems  :( <br />
<br />
On that note, thrown items should be able to be thrown from the ammo slot, needing a bow in range to shoot arrows from the ammo alot makes sense, obviously, but we dont use a sling to throw hammers / stars / javelins / whatever and should have no requirements or prerequisites over our range slots to throw anything at all, speaking of all classes ofcourse.<br />
<br />
I'm surprised monks havent made this happen already considering they cant use bows and lose stats from using ammo in their range slots just so they can throw to tag.</div></div><hr />
