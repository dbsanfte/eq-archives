The Only thing i'm missing is the 3 Polished Stonemite Scales (shell). According to Allak this scales (shell) is from A Venomous Stonemite in Vxed - The Crumbling Caverns. I already spent 2 days (2hours or so on first and another 5 + hours in Vxed killing all the spawns and the stonemites that spawn on us but not a single shell/scales drop. Am I missing something here? Is this Quest broken? maybe the drop is? Any info would be great <br />
<br />
-Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nayl</div><div class="date">07-31-2004, 04:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, its not broken, its just a typical EQ quest, i.e.; welcome to the stupid timesink part.  Several folks in my guild doing this quest, typical experience seems to be that you will spend several hours per shell drop in Vxed.<br />
<br />
Enjoy.</div></div><hr />

Welcome to the world of RNG.</div></div><hr />

The mask because no one knew wtf to do and the dwarf gave no hints, and the belt because those damned stonemite shells would not freaking drop.  Think I spent about 18-24 hours farming the zone in for stonemites before I got all three shells.  The arisen beludu's in the northern area of the zone can drop tainted spectral essences also.  Got one from them in about 100 kills.<br />
<br />
Gotta thank the dev's for the stat/effect change on it =x  bitched alot for it!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Seijiro Hiko</div><div class="date">08-01-2004, 07:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">15 sec haste? You talking about the duration of this spell? I just got the belt last night and duration timer was at 15min. Which brings me to another question. Heard from others that this haste stacks with other spell haste (Overhaste). Anyone know for sure if this is true or not? Some say it is and some says it's not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Northerner</div><div class="date">08-01-2004, 10:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It used to be 15 seconds in duration and yet still cast, not worn or anything.  That was quite useless naturally.  Stacking haste information is available at http://lucy.allakhazam.com/stacking.html?id=5067&amp;source=Live.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">08-01-2004, 10:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Twitching Speed is just like any other haste that might be cast on you (VQ, celerity, whatever).  Overhaste effects will stack, other normal hastes won't.</div></div><hr />
