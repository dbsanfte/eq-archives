<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ealdidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">One of biggest upgrades casters have received over melees is horses.  Horses is a disadvantage at best when meleeing and a huge bonus for casters that grow bigger the more intense fighting becomes.  PoP further increased horse power by being almost exclusively outdoors.  Horses need to be balanced as part of melee balancing (along with adding things like Focus Effect: Improved Melee Damage IV and Focus Effect: Taunting of Zek)  Here are my suggestions:<br />
<br />
1) Making meleeing on horseback no more difficult than meleeing on foot.<br />
2) Give warriors, paladins and shadowknights a trample skill trainable at level 45.  <br />
<br />
Trample: up to level*2 damage to target, level*3 at 201+ skill; agro equal to damage dealt*2 (boostable with AAs).  Trample would help warriors hold aggro and could be tuned to do low damage (and thus low aggro) on raid targets.  Heck, give a bonus to knights using their AA horse.<br />
<br />
Problems:<br />
1) Other classes whining<br />
2) Another 7k+ warriors need to spend for a crutch<br />
3) LDoN is going to be indoors</div></div><hr />

If not it would be like those annoying little vine things in echo, first time that did damage to me and i couldnt kicks its ass, i was soooooo pissed, any hoo....................</div></div><hr />

Reading comprehension, thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Whats with this &quot;Reading comprehension, thanks.&quot; shit? If you can't hold a conversation without trying to belittle other peoples views then odds are people aren't going to take your ideas seriously.  Try not to post with your dick in your hand.<br />
<br />
Meleeing from horse back on raids would make it more difficult to fit what can often be already too many melee in a small hit box.  <br />
<br />
Simply put a person on a horse takes up more space than a person not on a horse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The &quot;reading comprehension&quot; crap means that he didn't read the topic good enough to fully understand what he's talking about. It can also show up at &quot;Reading Comprehension&gt;you&quot; too. But hey, everyone fucks up once in a while, eh? =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Still, horsie melees are much bigger than footies. With some of PoP mobs having ridiculously small hitboxes (omg thangbrand is a prime example of SoEs stupidy there) you want to be as small as possible</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ealdidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If you make a horse trample and do damage then it should be able to be damaged or even killed imo<br />
<br />
Well, if they kill you, there won't be anymore trampling.  Do you want horses to have a red bar of their own and be affected by AEs or what? (Not sure if that's a good idea or not although it's worth debating)<br />

<br />
So the hitbox just needs to be bigger for someone on horseback, or we need an AA that allows you to render the horse invisable.  (Honestly though, PoP mob hitboxes are a separate problem that also needs addressing)<br />
<br />
Another reason this needs discussing is that other games (like WoW) want to include mounts into their gameplay things like this need to be address before their games go public.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thanks for the tip Ninja, but I know what someone means when they post &quot;Reading comprehension &gt; you&quot; or &quot;Reading comprehension thanks&quot; or some other gay shit.<br />
<br />
My point was that if you present an idea and someone else points out some flaws in it / criticizes it, if you want to be taken seriously then don't try and flame them but present arguements against thier point.<br />
<br />
I want to read a thread discussing solutions to class balance, not something thats going to turn into name calling five posts down.  Too many message boards are going to shit these days with so many people needing to wave thier i-Penises about with this &quot;reading comprehension &gt; you&quot; BS.</div></div><hr />
