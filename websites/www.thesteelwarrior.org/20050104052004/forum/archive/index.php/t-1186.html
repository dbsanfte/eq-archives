You get AA and your charm increases in power whether you do the quest or the kill for the flag.</div></div><hr />

To get the max version, you have to be Time flagged.<br />
<br />
Time flag is not trivial.<br />
<br />
The lower versions, well yes they are better than any other charm out there because every other charm out there sucks ass.</div></div><hr />

Hm, can anyone help to confirm this? I am PoV/PoS/BoT/PoNB flagged, and Tactics keyed (so 4 flags and 1 key). Stats on my charm are 7ac 30hps 4str/sta 3dex/agi 3sv all. Would appreciate it if anyone with 5 flags could check their charm's stats.</div></div><hr />

You actually have 2 flags, 1 key and your charm reflects that. You can tell by looking at the HP, you get 10hp per flag/key (warrior charm anyway).<br />
<br />
Here are the flags that affect the charm:<br />
PoS/PoV (PoJ trials)<br />
CoD (Grummus or key)<br />
BoT (key only)<br />
PoTorment (Terris Thule)<br />
HoH (AD or key)<br />
PoTactics (Behemoth or key)<br />
Tower of Sol Ro (Agnarr, Saryrn, Bertox, MM)<br />
Plane of Earth/Air/Water (RZ)<br />
Plane of Fire (Sol Ro)<br />
PoTime</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here are the flags that give 1 AA:<br />
PoS/PoV (PoJ trials)<br />
CoD (Grummus or key)<br />
BoT (key only)<br />
PoTorment (Terris Thule)<br />
HoH (AD or key)<br />
PoTactics (Behemoth or key)<br />
Tower of Sol Ro (Agnarr, Saryrn, Bertox, MM)</div></div><hr />

<br />
The purpose of having a charm slot? I don't know if you know this, but most people didn't have a charm. Many people realized how fruitless it could be to farm a charm in the LoY zones for hours and days so many (like myself) didn't. I don't think you understand the the difficulty in having the charm's power higher... you had to either kill a hard ass mob or go on some mindless quest for hours to have it up one level! I don't know about you but it seems like an ok reward to me given the fact that having killed that hard ass mob or quested for hours meant nothing now that the lower tier planes are open.<br />
<br />
It seems like no matter what some people do sometimes, they're damned if they do and they're damned if they don't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darkoan</div><div class="date">06-12-2003, 02:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Question for lamers like myself with ZERO flags..  Can I now flag for areas that the patch opens to me anyway and proceed with the quest for this charm?<br />
<br />
If so, thats pretty cool leaving a reason to do the PoJ trials.  I was a bit dissappointed that I'd never have to go through the PoJ trials, I've tried it a time or two with no luck but was looking forward to someday getting it right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brudal the Fat</div><div class="date">06-12-2003, 03:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You get a max of 7 aaxp with elemental flags or Time flag. So nobody is getitng 8 aaxp from this, confirmed from some friends in po time.<br />
<br />
You can have 0 flags and say &quot;What craft&quot; and get this charm. It will be 0ac and no stats but with every flag you get after that it will increase. I absolutely love the idea but I agree I was rather shocked at how nice the charm was. It could have been half what it is and people would be still be very happy with it.<br />
<br />
However, not complaing at all. I finally broke 9k hp last night which isn't too bad considering no Elemental gear at all. Very pleased with the 6aaxp I got and my charm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cardinal</div><div class="date">06-12-2003, 04:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think you understand the the difficulty in having the charm's power higher... you had to either kill a hard ass mob or go on some mindless quest for hours to have it up one level! <br />
<br />
I fully understand what it takes to get the flags (ok so I presumed it would be 8 axp for the final charm, since it was 22 ac 7axp and 90 hp for the thing for everything but the Time plane), although I do not yet have Time access, I certainly appreciate the difficulty in getting there (and lord knows have died oft enuf in tryin )....   My point is just that they made this reward so out of proportion with respect to everything else available for the charm slot, so as to render the charm slot nothing more as your &quot;intricate wooden charm slot&quot;  Every average lvl 60 and above (at least) is going to have the same item in the charm slot now.  Seems so ....  communistic<br />
<br />
Of course its nice that there is some carrot for getting your flags now, and you don't see me refusing to wear it,  but the reward for getting flagged is being able to get to the &quot;uber&quot; planes, the place where all the real goodies drop. That reward is still there.  <br />
<br />
I can't believe that I am alone in thinking that you should do something to earn a 100 hp or mana item in a slot, above and beyond that which you would have done anyway to just progress through the expansion.  But hey, if a million dollars dropped on my head, who am I to turn it down.  Doesn't mean I think I earned it ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">06-12-2003, 05:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can't believe that I am alone in thinking that you should do something to earn a 100 hp or mana item in a slot <br />
You're not alone. I agree 100%. While I am not going to turn it down, I do think this charm is way too good for the effort involved. I spent hours camping a 30 hp/mana charm - which was about as good as it got, until yesterday. Now I have an 80hp/100mana charm for something I would have done anyway. To me, the reward for being elemental/time flagged was the insane gear, unparalleled exp, and nice quiet empty zones.<br />
<br />
Oh well, I suppose this is a good sign anyway. The people spoke up and SOE listened. I only hope they don't start complying with every rediculous request though, it would be nice to still have some challenges left in the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kellaen</div><div class="date">06-12-2003, 06:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dunno, the LoY charms were meant for up to level 60's content no? Most of the gear in LoY reflects that stat wise, so did the charms. Problem is there are 0 (excluding now) charms outside of LoY access zones so you had nothing alternative to go find / camp. They did this for more incentive to plunk down 20-30 for the expansion. <br />
<br />
Now they've busted it out to the masses, I don't doubt there will be some non-loy alternatives out there within the near future (tho I agree the stats are way nicer then I've come to expect from SoE freebie).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cily</div><div class="date">06-12-2003, 06:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What exactly should the reward been?<br />
<br />
An item that you wouldnt use?<br />
<br />
Yay.<br />
<br />
Maybe more AA? No thanks.<br />
<br />
The public opinion was the reward should be AA or a charm. They did both, I cannot think of a much better solution. Then again, I am not a game designer.<br />
<br />
Cily</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Garoar</div><div class="date">06-12-2003, 07:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For the people who think this is unfair to have , please remove it from your charm slot and /destroy, but leave mine alone please, IMO its about time SoE gave something away without hours of mind numbing camps, I camped the Earring of veracity for days and still dont have my 3rd, I camped hours in PoD for ooze for my talismen neck, hours no days in PoI to get the parts in there, I've camped Stormfeather for days, and still havent seen em, so IMO its about time they gave back for timesinks, if it werent stupid screwed up broken quests in the past I'd have peices of gear elsewhere that would add up to these stats, so for once I dont have to waste an entire week for a decent peice of gear *cough* Epic *cough*. <br />
To those of you who camped lowsy charms /comfort , I camped the Juggler charm for 3 days on and off and dont have that one either. <br />
/cheer SoE about dam time !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taelen</div><div class="date">06-12-2003, 10:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Have to say I'm happy with the 7aa and the charm.  Never got around to farming one in LoY anyway.  The reward was worth the tedium of having to not only do the flags once, but go back and re-flag others.  Could have been much worse, imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darkoan</div><div class="date">06-13-2003, 02:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry to be a broken record..  but for clarification.. If I get the 0 AC (no flags) charm from the NPC, it will automatically change as I flag AND I will get an AA ding per flagging?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kellaen</div><div class="date">06-13-2003, 05:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It should yes, if not re-equip it. AA's you should get by talking to the dorf as well yes. So something for you to look forward to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cervesa</div><div class="date">06-13-2003, 01:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tried this with an alt who is only flagged for PoNB (hedge) and he got nada.<br />
<br />
Looks like PoNB doenst count as a Flag for this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">06-13-2003, 11:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;IMO its about time SoE gave something away without hours of mind numbing camps, &quot;<br />
<br />
Uh ... not to sound like an ass, but you do realize that THAT behavior is what SOE is seeking from you (and me, and all of us really). The timesinks are there to keep you playing to keep you paying.<br />
<br />
Wandor's right. The reward is a tad too good for the effort involved.<br />
<br />
Everyone's going to say, &quot;But getting all these flags requires lots of effort.&quot;<br />
<br />
Which is true.<br />
<br />
But you didn't get those flags (or go back and backflag people) to get a charm.<br />
<br />
You did it to ADVANCE you and your guild.<br />
<br />
This is like dinging 20, and instead of being able to get a surname, you get 5 free levels, and an AC 25 BP for kicks.<br />
<br />
Like you wouldn't have dinged 20 anyway?<br />
<br />
Ah well ... I'll drop it. People got their charms (myself included). Have fun, enjoy it.<br />
<br />
I'm just surprised they gave out both that AND AA. That's so unlike them.<br />
<br />
AND I have a question ... I've heard that if you get a flag right now that you didn't have before ... you DON'T get AA.<br />
<br />
Like say I went and finally finished the CoD quest, and got the flag for it. Would I get free AA? Or is it just people who had the flags before the patch?<br />
<br />
I've heard yes and no to the question. Some confirmation would be nice.<br />
<br />
Anyone gotten a flag since the patch and gone and tried to get the AA XP?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">faederya</div><div class="date">06-14-2003, 09:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">AND I have a question ... I've heard that if you get a flag right now that you didn't have before ... you DON'T get AA. <br />
<br />
I got flagged for Torment the day after the patch, I got a Charm increase and one AA.   So getting flagged from now forward will net one AA per flag, yes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">06-14-2003, 09:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">can you still get these if you get flagged at a later time?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The charm and the &quot;tell me stories&quot; will grant an AA / Charm increase today, tomorrow, and in the future for each flag that you increase<br />
<br />
CoD<br />
PoJ Trials<br />
BoT<br />
HoH<br />
Torment<br />
Tactics<br />
-- Those give AA's (plus one more possibly SOLRO)<br />
Elemental<br />
PoTime<br />
-- These give Charm increase not AA's (possibly one more making 10 charm increases)</div></div><hr />
