<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Drunder50</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The other day I was in Permafrost doing part of my Epic. I have never been there before. I found a large wooden door and went in only to find some very large mobs (Ice giants?). Anyway after clearing them I continued and inadvertently aggro'd a couple ice giants (Dark Blue to me) and turned around and fell down down through a trap door into a few Large bears (Also Dark blue). Now I have 2 Ice Giants and 3 bears on me. No matter what direction I went there were more mobs. Not looking good. From playing my wizard (My first Toon), gate was not so reliable when getting hit and especially when getting hit by several mobs. It was VERY rare that i could actually get Gate off. I tried to gate and of course it got interrupted. My soulmate cleric was back at the jails so I was looking ahead to my impending CR. Then It hit me.. Maybe I can hit Fortitude (12 Sec duration/Take Zero damage) and then click the gate potion (10 sec cast time). Well it worked. I was at 40% health roughly when I gated out. <br />
<br />
Now was that one of those &quot;Rare&quot; situations where i just got lucky and got the gate off or is that a reliable way of getting one self out of a hairy situation?.. Anyone else ever use this with any kind of reliability? <br />
<br />
Just curious</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've used that method 3-4 times, and it's worked every time so far.  Probably the only thing that would hose you are casters getting in a stun, or an unstable gate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">This used to not work, back before discs were chaned Furious lasted 8 seconds and Fortitude lasted 9, but with the new changes, as long as you wedge yourself in a corner before casting (to prevent being moved which would cause the spell to interrupt) you should be ok like this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">grats =D it worked often for me as well. Now i just carry a gate hammer around (get a large train, haste off, haste item off, fort, rampage)</div></div><hr />

<br />
  That is by far the best use for rampage I've ever seen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you have a map of Permafrost you'll notice that the way out of that section of the dungeon leads to Vox's lair. I've never actually done this, but I would assume that if you could get to Vox's lair, she'd banish you out of the zone because you're over level 52.<br />
Vox gate, unlimited charges, lol.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
LOL getting a gate to &quot;proc&quot; with a bow.<br />
this would be the best use of a single arrow, ever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Fortitude + gate potion does work.  <br />
<br />
Hammer &gt; all.  <br />
<br />
Nobody ever buys them, but you can get vendor insta-cast gate potions for 1100ish pp that are worth it in some situations like that where you are about to die in a place you *really* don't want to CR from.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Drunder50</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thanks all for the replies.. Kinda figured it was reliable but wanted to see others say it was so .. Never thought of wedging myself in a corner. That would suck clicking the gate potion and it getting interrupted cause I got pushed.  I will keep that in mind for next time =)<br />
<br />
Thanks again!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Remf da Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">CT lizard blood potions are also insta-cast, and still drop in the ferrott on one of the named lizards (cenobite?).  Dumps you in CT at the wizzie spire, which is not optimal, but better than CRing deep in other bad places w/o graveyards.<br />
<br />
RdT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I used to collect lizard blood potions, but I hand them out to the beggars who won't leave me alone, and tell them that it's instant cast so use it in an emergency.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hmm. Is there a thread/source/list of gate items? I mean outside of regular shaman-made stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Xarilok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">sigh, dead link</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Binnamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Heh, I was deep in seb once with a LD healer and told the mage to gate because I had an insta gate pot. Mage gated, I went to click my insta gate potion and it collapsed.<br />
<br />
Good thing there was a necro down there heading to the fungi king $</div></div><hr />

<br />
Or you can be cool like me and spent a couple 1000pp(more like 10-15k at a time) in the casino to get them... *come on golden ticket*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Northerner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Lizard Blood potion still drops in Feerot, hang a left coming out of CT and it's the pyramid nearest the zonewall there.  I always carry the gatehammer, a 10dose and the instant.  (The instants I use once in a blue moon when scouting targets as a Rogue.  I don't get spotted much but when I do, it sure as hell is typically in the middle of a sea of reds.)<br />
<br />
After all this time, the gatehammer is likely my favorite single item.  Once they put the books in it only grew more in value!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>WaardarMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Usually in the situation you described I use the OT hammer like an Earthshaker.<br />
<br />
Just hit Furious / Fort (whatever you're used to using), click off haste, and hit Rampage. 90% of the time you'll gate out instantly. If you don't, you've generally pushed your average enough you'll be out in another second or two.</div></div><hr />
