<br />
<br />
Anyone able to ' enlighten &quot; me about how to start/what happens in these air rings? Whats needed to start them etc?<br />
<br />
<br />
all answers are helpful, and no question is answer is a bad one(think i'm gonna regret that). hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">07-09-2004, 03:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">air rings are de debil  :D <br />
<br />
wish i could tell u how they start them, but thats normally done by our pullers. i just get told what to tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pag0</div><div class="date">07-09-2004, 04:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">First, air rings are trackable. I don't know the name of the &quot;track&quot; mob, but your rangers/druids should have no trouble seeing which are live.<br />
<br />
There are 4 rings, 1 per &quot;island&quot; of mobs. each of which spawn their corresponding Avatar. To spawn the avatar, kill all of the mobs on a given island and complete the &quot;ring&quot; event. Each island is different, and I won't give much more info away. When you complete the island (and kill the boss mob who drops loot such as the Puresteel Mantle from Mist) the Avatar will spawn in one of the temples. The same Avatar will always spawn in the same temple, and your trackers or rogues can guide you to them the first time.<br />
<br />
First island (go up the first tunnel, and go straight past Baltador the cursed at the first cross section) is Bees. This spawns Smoke (or Wind, I always confuse the first 2, but it is either Smoke or Wind). Bees root, which makes them somewhat annoying.<br />
<br />
Second island is Elementals. Nothing really special, iirc they proc a dd or small ae, but nothing to fear too much. My comps both suck so targeting is sometimes difficult for me.  Finsihing this spawns either Wind or Smoke (again, always confuse them)<br />
<br />
Third island is Birds. Birds have a tiny hit box, but a huge attack animation. Just a tip, but you can use the targetting ring to get an idea of how close you need to be to them. The boss of this island drops the Warrior only Puresteel Mantle that everyone likes. It is the rare drop (for my guild, 0 out of 10+ kills, can't check exact numbers atm) <br />
<br />
Fourth island contains the bane of most people's existence. Spiders. You will encounter a few spiders in your hunting that are roamers, but nothing like this. Pain in the ass to target, spin-stun makes agro a pain in the ass. This island also contains the portal to Xegony's island, but you will need the keys first. Did I mention spiders are a pain in the ass?<br />
<br />
I hope this helps, most of the rings seem to give you 2+ hours to spawn the avatar, and then an additional period of time to kill the avatar. If you CR fast from a wipe to the avatar, you can sometimes get 2 attempts in, but don't count on it. Dust is the only one you may have problems completing in time the first few times.  The Avatars seem to like to mem wipe quite a bit as well. The only general tip I would give is to have a solid offtanking crew,and try to get your pullers to have mobs incoming so that you always have at least 1 mob in camp, but that should be par for the course at this point ;)<br />
<br />
Good Luck, and welcome to elementals.<br />
<br />
&lt;Edited to clarify that spiders are a pain in the ass&gt;</div></div><hr />

Clerics didn't have it when I raided there, but being the lead cleric at the time I died so often I would DI myself instead of tanks clearing spider island.<br />
<br />
Blue Phoenixes proc some kind of dot that overwrites clarity line.<br />
Wave of White Noise = silence.<br />
<br />
Make sure your crew speaks the fuck up when a spider walks into camp; it can roam in from the back of your raid and start 1-rounding every caster and priest in sight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">07-09-2004, 12:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The islands that spawn the avatars are in many ways tougher than the corresponding avatars.  The avatars themselves are very easy by elemental standards.  I think they all hit for 2166, some flurry, some rampage, most memwipe, at least one AE stuns, and one has short range silence.  The bee and bird islands are easy, the elemental island is somewhat tougher (huge aggro/assist ranges on the elemental champions mean you'll probably wipe on a 5+ pull on one of your earlier trips), and the spider island is often compared to the RZ event although there are tactics that can make it easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">turkishbull</div><div class="date">07-09-2004, 03:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Birds debuff.  I cant remember which ones do this but it is a good idea to have 4 junk buffs up whenever you get to the bird island.  And yes.....spiders do suck in PoAir</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bigchest</div><div class="date">07-09-2004, 07:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">with 500 MR you should resist a majority of the spider stuns which makes clearing dust island and starting the event easier</div></div><hr />
