2) Need a new neck/belt obviously, any quest which no need uber guild to do it?<br />
3) Atm, Im working at coldain ring, chardok quest ring/cord quest, I believe these items is nice, right?<br />
4) Any slot i should upgrade? any suggestion?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1, Several bits of Fierce Heraldric are better than Warlords / Skyshrine armour, so yes FH is great.  Armour of a quality which used to take raids to achieve for a good price in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
2, Neck and Belt- could always go FH here aswell.  Clattering bone necklace from the grey and Heavy Rubicite girdle from CT zone are frequently recommended for these slots as well.<br />
<br />
3, 9th / 10th coldain rings are both nice, but for the amount of effort Valorium Rings of Gallantry are easier to obtain these days.  The insta click on 8th ring+ is nice to have tho and fills an entry requirement of many guilds.  Chardok ring and cord are nice items and will last you a long time.<br />
<br />
4, Most of your gear is pretty nice- really nice for your level.  If you are weighing up between FH and SS you might want to swap your 2nd bracer, legs and boots to FH but that really just comes down to budget.  The gear you have is fine for now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kiya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">First off, I'd punch in your proper level into your magelo, it states that you are level 46.  <br />
For the best bang for your buck, I'd save up and buy fierce heraldic collar and girdle.  I'd also quest up to at least the 8th coldain ring.  I use mine all the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Akaboku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks for the advice, Im working on 8th ring and FH. What Im really need is a taunting machine.. sigh BoC 350k =/<br />
Chardok quest seems hard to me since dorga is re-ramped.<br />
<br />
Sorry dont mind me. All my war friend around my lv, they have much better armor then me.</div></div><hr />
