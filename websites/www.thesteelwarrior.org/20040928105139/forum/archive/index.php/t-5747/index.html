<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>zito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Howdy everyone.<br />
<br />
I'm looking at building a new PC, with its main use being gaming.  I'm looking for some advice on how to go about getting the best possible results.  I'm OK on the actual &quot;insert TabA into SlotB&quot; kind of stuff; what I'm mainly looking for is recommendations and advice on brand names of gear to use/avoid, etc.  I've checked out a fair number of the &quot;Build a PC Yourself&quot; websites, and gotten a lot of ideas from them, but I'm looking for more ideas from here, from ppl who use the stuff in the same way that I'll mostly be using it for.  What brand names would YOU use?  Which MB is best to use with which vid card for the best results?  Which power supplies blow up in 6 months?  Which technology/brand/model should I avoid because it's going to be outdated in 3 months and never used again, a la Betamax tapes?  Alternately, what sites have you found that were unbiased towards particular brands and had good advice?  I guess I'm just being overly cautious here, as my last PC *this one* has given me some grief.  Any info is very much appreciated, and thank you in advance.<br />
<br />
PS. I have about $2000.00 to spend, not including the OS *btw, what's the best gaming OS??*, or externals such as monitor/speakers etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>slyse</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">When I built my box, I started out by watching the newspapers.  If where you live is anything like where I live, every sunday (give or take) the big electronics stores like Fry's, MicroCenter, and CompUSA send out inserts with their sales.  I'd just watch those for a good deal on a processor/mobo combo, or a good video card, or some other piece of gear that you're looking for.  As an example, I got my athlon xp  pro 1700+ and MSI mobo for 100 bucks...a friend pointed out the fry's ad, and we both did some checking on the mobo being offered, and it was a sweet deal.<br />
<br />
Once you get a board and processor you're happy with, I'd start checking around for other bits that you want.  newegg is great for good deals on graphics cards if you get tired of waiting for sales.  So yeah, that's how I did it, and how I'd recommend other people do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">That works.<br />
<br />
You can also check out newegg.com. It's basically the best/most reliable online store for PC shit.<br />
<br />
As for OS, Windows XP is very popular right now - for good reason. It's stable, doesn't have the RAM leak that Win98 does.<br />
<br />
The best PC speakers you can buy right now are Klipsch 5.1 Pro Audio. Expect to pay $300 for em though, in addition to a 5.1 compatible sound card.<br />
<br />
Whatever mobo you get, I recommend you grab one with an 800 MHz FSB. ATI Radeon 9800 Pros seem to be top dog among consumer video cards, haven't heard complaints about them with any mobo yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Timmok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Personally I went Intel all the way, both processor+mobo. And stuck with branded memory certified for their particular mobo to avoid any issues. I was considering AMD64, but none of the mobo seems to support more than 3 dimms, so that was out of the question.<br />
<br />
Had a noise control chasis already and reused my old graphic card, so just went out and bought the components.<br />
<br />
P4-3200 Mhz<br />
Intel D875PBZ motherboard<br />
2 1-gig kits of matched dimms(Kingston Valueram - KVR400X64C3AK2/1G)<br />
Seagate 80mb SATA HD.<br />
<br />
I assembled it and it worked like a charm from the first boot, no problems at all. This actually surprised me a bit since its been 2 1/2 years since I installed a computer from scratch(my trusty old p3-866 which is now finally retired).<br />
<br />
Only one small catch if you buy a SATA harddisk: remember to buy a power converter cable too hehe. During assembly I found out this while there was a SATA cable included with the retail mobo box, there was no power connector. So had to run out and buy that.<br />
<br />
Oh btw, even with a P4-3200 running through Barindu is slightly laggy :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Did you put XP on it?  XP sure installs smoothly.  You hardly need to install your drivers half the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>chaddu1256</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well I've built multiple computers in the last year or so.  I recommend www.tigerdirect.com to order alot of the parts from.  They have really good deals and are pretty cheap to boot.<br />
<br />
I know my most recent I bought a Shuttle Mobo and athlon xp 2200 for about 115.  Along with my geforcefx 5600 for about 70.  <br />
<br />
If you got about 2 grand to work with im sure you could build a beast ordering from tiger.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nayl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">$2000 for a gaming computer is a lot.  Here's a rough breakdown:<br />
<br />
CPU - P4 3.2 or AMD 3.2, roughly 400$ - Im not familiar with the latest wave of processors, but my impression is that the 64 bit thing is not going to actually be useful until the software catches up, say in a year to two years, by which time it will be time to upgrade the hardware again...<br />
<br />
Motherboard - ASUS is the best, imho, whichever CPU you go with.  Get the best one appropriate to your CPU, will run close to $200. <br />
<br />
Video card - ATI 9800 XT - Currently the best.  Driver issues reportedly long since resolved.  About $450<br />
<br />
Sound Card - Not sure what to tell you.  I got a Sound Blaster Audigy 2, and had installation problems that resulted in a HD reformat.  Got it right the second time, but it still is buggy with some games.  If I had it to do over again, I might go with an onboard sound chip, sound isn't that crucial to me with games.  Sound Card if you get one = $150<br />
<br />
Memory - Get two 512 mb sticks of the best 3200 ram you can.  Corsair is good.  About $300.<br />
<br />
Hard Drive - Get something huge, like 160 gb, you won't ever use it all, but its stunningly cheap.  Make sure it has a 8mb buffer, and uses a SATA connection.  Western Digital, Maxtor, Seagate - about 150$<br />
<br />
DVD/CD drive - For about $150 to $200 you can get a optical drive now that will read and record every format of optical disc out there.  At this point, the best bets appear to be Pioneer and Lite-on.  <br />
<br />
Case and power supply - you have about $200 left of your $2000, I would suggest something aluminum with lots of fans and a good power supply - Antec, at least 400 watts.  Lyan makes some nice Aluminum cases.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Timmok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Brutul: Yes I put XP on it, if that was adressed to me. And install is a no-brainer I agree, I just set the bios to boot from the CD-rom drive and plopped in the CD and booted/installed from that. Didnt take long very long.<br />
<br />
I was pleasantly surprised to see XP booting just as fast as WinME did on my old machine(one of the few good things about WinME was its fast boot). <br />
<br />
I dont see any reason to put anything less than Win XP on a brand new machine. You get alot of nice functionality and stability/multi-tasking seems better. And I dont think Win98/WinME support hyper-threading if you are getting a P4.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Advices for best cash/performance. Never buy latest CPU/GPU. Buy stuff which was latest a month or two ago. That way you loose very little in performance and save quiet a bit of cash.<br />
<br />
Choice of mother board is one of the most important ones. Its called mother board for a reason. In this day and age I'd go for stability and ease of tweaking. I like ASUS.<br />
<br />
I strongly advise against ATI since they never have been known to update their drivers and its the most important thing about graphics card. I'd go with NVIDIA. Of course if you planing to upgrade every year or so thats enough story<br />
<br />
Soundcard- stick with SoundBlaster cause they have been THE sound card for games for last 15 years. Althought they almost never update their drivers.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Sam DeathWalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Just picked up a PNY 5900 (190bucks) for da main computer and PNY 5700 (160bucks) for my 2 secondaries (the other 3 have 4200TI). That 5900 has a heat sink that is UNREALS for a video card. Wootzor.<br />

Nvidia Drivers are so excellent I put the 5700 in a computer that had a Gforce3 and it just ran with full 5700 properties with no loading of anything new or anything lol.....</div></div><hr />
