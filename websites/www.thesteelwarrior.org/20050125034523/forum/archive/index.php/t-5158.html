<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nomryh</div><div class="date">01-10-2004, 12:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Alright, here's the deal. I'm in a guild that raids pretty much 6 days a week (all but Friday). However, I can only raid on weekends due to my mom, which means I raid 1 day a week. This,a s you can see, puts me @ a serious disadvantage DKP wise. I was planning @ first to get a BoC/Hategiver/Bloodfrenzy combo to dualwield, but now I'm having second thoughts. To get these three weapons would lock up my DKP for a long time and probably take 2 months to get. So, instead of doing this, I had the thought of getting a good 2hs wep. Right now, my guild is almost to VT... we're just farming shards, we've killed emp 2x now. I would aug any weapons I get with Anger III. So, my question is, which 2hs weapon would be good agro that I could obtain? Would it be better than a dualwielded combo of BoC/Hategiver/Bloodfrenzy both aug'd with Anger III? The OTHER option is to get just 1 of the BoC/Hategiver/Bloodfrenzy, aug it with Anger III, then dual wield it with Elphorn's Cleaver ( http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=8752 ) which is what I use now. I would also aug my cleaver with Anger III. So, any feedback would be MUCH appreciated! THANKS!</div></div><hr />

Emp drops a nice 2hs, or the great staff of the 4 winds is a good dps option it drops in Bot towers</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nomryh</div><div class="date">01-10-2004, 02:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry- I meant in group agro purposes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">paladiin</div><div class="date">01-12-2004, 02:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This past weekend, I tanked HoH and BoT (for the first time) at 64 with my trusty un-aug'd GSoT.  Did just fine, to my and the group's surprise.  Not agro lock by any means, but enough to take down BoT PH's, named, and a boss.  <br />
<br />
GSoT + Anger3 would have made it even easier.  It's the perfect option for someone who wants xp group agro, and doesn't want to spend DKP.  It's not the answer for everything, but it sure is the answer for a lot of things!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Prytty</div><div class="date">01-12-2004, 02:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you can kill Emp, you can kill Seru.  I'd reccomend a bbb for a 2 hander.  With anger3 it's more than sufficient to hold aggro when you need it<br />
<br />
*edit* just to elaborate more, I use bbb with Anger2 and I'm my guilds MA (RZ kill away from elementals).  I virtually never lose agro on a boss mob.  I have all my offensive AA's though, so ymmv.   I just got anger2 b/c i wanted to save the extra points for anger3 when I get a BoW.  In addition, the bbb is wonderful for exp groups, as the rune absorbs a significant amount of dps you take.</div></div><hr />
