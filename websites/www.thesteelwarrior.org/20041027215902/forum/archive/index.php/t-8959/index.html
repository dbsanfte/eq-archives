<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Conanix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Get some wepons you can get full stats with.  Also start looking for ornate in bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kintor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i  was fairly twinked when i came out of retirement,  my magelo, work on up to 51 because you can gain alot of new gear at that lvl. also legs/arms/bp dont worry about, ornate at 55, look at my magelo, i havent upgraded much in the past 15 or so lvls =(<br />

i had velium encrusted gauntlets, black plated collar, Sceptre of Destruction, and belt of raging nature. other items that req more than 46 i had and equipped at the level they require(acid bracers, visage, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gaspie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sell that split blade =\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Sell splitblade.<br />
Start researching better haste (you don't need it now, but it won't hurt later).<br />
get some cheap resist gear (or expensive, heh).<br />
Tank Vox and Naggy<br />
Level.<br />
Eventually, LDoNs or raids will be avenues for upgrades, but in your case I don't know that I'd mess with LDoNs yet, as the adventure points you get at 49 come pretty slowly. You'd level faster in PoJ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>voodoo5903</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">ok sell split blade and replace with what? i have ornate bp,helm,legs,arms already just gotta get 55.when do LDoN points get worth doing? also in MMC LDoN their is aug 1450 pts says 50% at lvl 49 is this true or am i confused? any suggestions on other haste items?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tooby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i *believe* the mmc aug is 36% max. i would suggest using tribute. i put it off for a while myself but do a little testing and you will find that raising something like 20k tribute points is pretty cheap, and 40% haste (once you are high enough i guess, not sure what is max tribute haste at 48) is better than bazaar or ldon options.<br />
<br />
As for ldon i leveled up in them almost fully from 25 to 55 which gave me perhaps 1500points, pretty senseless although it helps the adventure stone.. but as for well spent time - dont.<br />
<br />
if you can sell the splitblade for the insane prices i see on luclin (50-90k) then i would just plain sell it and not worry about what the replacement will be. The new OOW weapons look awesome but i guess theres a recommended level.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">you have a kind of NPC in your starting city and in PoK (which is different for each race), that will accept much pp and much gears in exange for tribute points. when you have some, you can consume them with 'hidden buff' that cost tribute points and are to choose at this NPC.<br />
for example you can get haste (that count as worn gears), HP, AC, ATK, ... beware it cost much, but since one month you can turn it on or off at will (every 10min frame set), to save your tribute point while tradeskilling and such.<br />
look at lucy for tribute value of items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Atkins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I currently just dinged level 50 and i am agnostic warrior I may have some gear ideas for you in my magelo.  Please sell the splitblade to your local ranger asap!!!<br />
You are lucky to have a deity as it makes nice gear much cheaper.<br />

sorry for double post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kalem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Thanks much Yoda, that's the first I hear about Tribute   :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">beware !! OoW has bring a &quot;Raid Tribute system&quot; !! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>voodoo5903</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">at lvl 47 i get 31% haste with tribute.have 30k tribute but worthless till lvl 50 when i can upgrade it to 36%.Any ideas on what to replace split blade with....trying to get BoC but any alternatives? ty for the info so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Vegalord65</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Sigh, always with the splitblade. *No comment*. WHY DO PEOPLE BUY THIS WEAPON?!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kalem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">ok, I've got to ask, what's so bad about the splitblade?  Seems like a decent weapon for its level recommendation.  As far as common reasonably priced bazaar buyable weapons, it has pretty good dps.  Is it the lack of hate proc?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Vegalord65</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Less aggro than a CHoS and considerably more pricey.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Atkins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Yes no aggro proc on a warr weapon seems to not be well looked upon.  <br />
These have worked for me pre level 50:<br />
sword of the bloodsworn<br />
reinforced-sandstone hilt sword<br />
these worked well for me for the appropriate levels. <br />
<br />
at level 50+ <br />
copper hammer of striking<br />
<br />
These are budget for aggro 1handers atm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>voodoo5903</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">split blade with a dmg proc aug or anger3 not good?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Vegalord65</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Chos would be better and still far cheaper. Two procs &gt; one proc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>voodoo5903</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">i am currently using ChoS in my offhand im talking primary split blade with 150 dd aug proc or anger 3 augment? how would this be?</div></div><hr />
