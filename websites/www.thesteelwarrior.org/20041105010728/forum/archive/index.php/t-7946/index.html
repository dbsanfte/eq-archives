<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kebast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Question...I'm sure this is buried in these forums somewhere...but I've lurked around a bit and can't find an answer.<br />
<br />
I have a warrior coming into his 50's and have some weapon questions.  I'm currently using a Copper Hammer of Striking (with LDoN 75pt cold proc aug) and a Fabled Short sword of Ykesha.  What should I be looking for as an upgrade to either of these weapons? Since the warrior does not raid, it would need to be droppable or a no drop doable by one group of Gimp EP abled 65's.  BoC's are not for sale on my server...at least no time that I have checked.  Main is a 65 Cleric PoF ready, so money is not such a problem. <br />
<br />
Thanks for any info.</div></div><hr />

I also have a Fabled Executioner's Axe for 2HS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You are pretty much at the end of the line for weapons.  I can't think of anything obtainable with less than 2 groups that would be an upgrade at any level.  Your dual wield setup is good aggro (you could switch to a SoBS over the FSS for better stats but same aggro), your the Fabled Axe is good DPS (you could switch to a Velium Gemmed Greatsword when you get high enough, I suppose).<br />
<br />
You can still upgrade your other gear with single groups.  A Crinose Cape of the Werewolf (even with rec'd level) would be a better cloak.  Your bracers, arms, boots and pants are in need of upgrades.  I'd recommend farming SolRo (or Drunder or HOH) for ornate plate molds in preparation for when your warrior reaches 55, then fill all those slots with ornate as soon as you can.  As you get closer to 61, farm elemental bow parts with your EP enabled group to make a nice bow for your warrior.</div></div><hr />

That's what I was afraid of :(.  Thanks for the advise.  I already have some Ornate in the bank.  Going with the Bracers, Helm and Gauntlets.  Probably save for the EF or Nro LDoN Armor for a couple of slots.  Its hard to give Ornate Arms, Boots and Sleeves to an alt :).  They actually sell for a good bit on my server.  I'll probably just stick with my current weapons for a bit then...maybe save for an Anger aug since they can be removed without being destroyed now.  When I get a few more levels on me...some of the weapons that drop on raids with my main are starting to Grats Rot.  Maybe I can get lucky there sometime :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">if your main group is ep enabled, provided your tank is ok no reason u cant take a shot at getting the Greatblade of storms from BoT tower. that will be a nice upgrade to CHoS.  if you can get a ench to charm makes it all the faster.  To make it easier if you can get abou 8-9 including 2 clerics should be no problem at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Frostpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Not sure how few it would take to get the Obsidian Scimitar of War from VZ. I have only done him as a full blown raid, but it is very easy. I understand he is being done with a 1-2 groups now regularly. Maybe more experienced people here on the boards can confirm or deny this. In any case, I would put that on your list along with GBoS as potential upgrades.<br />
<br />
Also, the droppable gaunts/wrist/boots from hard LDoN might be an option if your cleric could win them there. Better than ornate as far as AC/HP go in all three slots.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The problem is our group can't quite do hard LDoN's yet, at least for the success points.  We haven't tried just name hunting.  My normal group has a Pally tank that went for all Offensive AA first.  He's working the Defense now.  A few more nights grinding AA and we might be ready.  Also, we usually do NBG loot with Mains getting loot over alts.  The PoP hits might be the way to go.  Still need a few levels/flags for that though.  Good to know there are options.  I got his Wind-worn BP in a pick up hit on BoT mini's.  We did those with 8 people, so I know what you mean about some PoP boss's being easy hits.<br />

Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have done Vallon with 2 groups, they were ele geared and had a high number of tanks and healers though.  With a good pull team who know the event Im sure it could be done with 1 group, but for casual players who dont have gear from raiding it may be a bit of a stretch.<br />
<br />
XTC should also be doable with a couple of groups although hategiver is absurdly rare.  Ofcourse the same applys, whats one groupable by time players isnt neccessarily going to be 1 groupable by players who would actually want the gear the mob drops.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just to give you an Idea...The Vadyn in AR is doable by my normal group.  Most of the Fabled gear my warrior has was also obtained 1 group style by the same group members.  We just got access to PoFire a couple of weeks ago, so we're not EP geared...just EP able :).  Same goes with Vex Thal, most of my guild just gained access a short time ago.  We have Cleared VT once... on our first scheduled raid there, WOOT!.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">your weapons are fine ... buy better armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kebast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I did pick up the SoBS just because I found it cheap.  I have logging on by default, so I'll play around with it and the Fabled SSoY.  I usually 3 box LDoN's with a cleric and rogue, so I use one weapon combination per run.  That gives me a pretty good estimation.  I parsed the Fabled executioner's axe last night.  At my level with no AA's and level 1 tribute haste it gave me 27.3 average DPS.  Which is ~1-2 % higher than my DW combo.  The haste proc helps a lot.  Not sure what the proc rate is suppose to be, but it seems to proc a lot.  I was suprised...the 2hander seemed to hold agro better than the DW setup...guess I shouldn't be surprised, max hit was 215+ and I saw a crit for 410 :).</div></div><hr />
