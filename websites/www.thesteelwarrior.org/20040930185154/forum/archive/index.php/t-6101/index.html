<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Merc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Apparently all the effects on items have had their description change.<br />
<br />
Now instead of Flowing Thought you have Mana Regeneration.<br />
<br />
Instead of Vengence you have Attack<br />
<br />
Regen effects are changed as well i think.<br />
<br />
While this may be well and good for the dumbasses of the game I think it totally gimps the 'cool' factor items used to have.<br />
<br />
Flowing Thought&gt;Mana Regeneration<br />
Vengence&gt;Attack<br />
<br />
This change was a mistake.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Daggorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Aye, I don't see the great need to redo all the naming on weapon spells.  I mean even us meatshields have enough cognative function to learn a few new words now and then.<br />
<br />
Why not just name Nagafen &quot;Uber Red Dragon&quot; while your at it?<br />
<br />
its not like anyone is trying to force Roleplaying down anyone's throat folks, this is simple variety of description. Just because some folks in game can't even pronounce thesaurus doesn't mean we need to start dumbing down.<br />
<br />
SOE, you need to expand minds, not shrink them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">This is pretty lame.  Part of the fun of EQ has been the lexicon of terms built up over the years...kinda disappointing they'd do this (but this is the same company that just gave every sense heading 200)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Wow, some people will find anything to whine about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dinian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Not quite sure why they made this change since the attack and regen caps are still in place.<br />
<br />
I guess its easier for new people to read and understand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It used to be that you were in THEIR world.<br />
<br />
Now they're really trying hard to make it so even the mentally challenged can figure things out.  It's starting to be not like a fantasy game anymore....it's just a fuckin text based game with graphics now. <br />
<br />
My first character was a wizard.  You have any idea how long it took me to figure out what O'Keil's Radiation did?  Funny thing is that I had more fun then than I do now.  What could possibly be wrong here.<br />
<br />
Let's replace AC with &quot;Stuff protecting you&quot; too.  AC is fucking confusing as hell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Goradain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">More changes:<br />
<br />
ATK = How gud yu hit stuf<br />
HP = That red bar that makes you gate when it runs out<br />
Taunt = That button that gives you a red message<br />
Disarm = That other button that gives you a red message<br />
Bash = &quot;See Slam&quot;<br />
Slam = &quot;See Bash&quot;<br />
Kick = &quot;See Slam and Bash, use while in illu... while looking like something you are not&quot;<br />
Assist = /hitwhatthatotherguyishitting<br />
Area Taunt = Keg party in your pants!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">They did add a leyend saying the % of Haste on items with worn Haste, thats cool really.<br />
<br />
I agree that keeping the effects name would have been better than dumbifing them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>lokkak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I honestly don't see a problem with this change.<br />
But then again, I always like knowing the back end numbers and didn't like to have to remember (or look up) things.  I didn't ask for the change, but I certainly am not going to say there is any harm in the change.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Umm, every vengance is 5 ATK, every FT is 1 mana regen.  You can add this shit up on your fingers and toes for christsakes.<br />
<br />
Why not just put the numbers in the effects description rather than remove the effect altogether??  They just scrapped one of the largest 'cool factors' in the game.  How did this idea make it live????</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I don't see how having some stupid name is a &quot;cool factor&quot;.  It's easy as hell to remember what veng and ft are, even for the idiots, so changing isn't really dumbing it down.  The Aura of Whatever effects weren't cool.  Only Aura of Battle and Aura of the Berserker had names I didn't think were stupid.  How do Aura of Courage, Bravery, Valor, and Daring equal regen and atk?  Oh no, now I see a real effect instead of seeing something stupid like &quot;Composure&quot; on it.  There were some that weren't too bad, but really, lots of it was just pointless and fairly stupid as they try to come up with just another worthless name.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Azaza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">One simple reason to hate the change:<br />
<br />
Makes the game easier for more kiddies to play.<br />
<br />
And that's good for them because they get more $$$.<br />
<br />
Bad for us then because at least 80% of them will be begging, training, whining, loot whoring, being stupid in /ooc, spamming, or some other form of annoyance.<br />
<br />
But hey, it's just a game right? :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Makes the game easier for more kiddies to play.<br />
<br />
You seriously believe this?  Fact is, the old way was pathetically easy to understand, even for the dumbest players.  Just as many idiots are going to be wandering around the same places with the same gear and the same knowledge as before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">It sure was hard to look up the description of Aura of (whatever) to see what it did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Bonequest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Pretty soon Sony will add an &quot;autoplay&quot; button that newbies can use to make their toon into a automated leveling machine.  It will LFG, fight, zone, buy gear, join raids, and even beg for you while you watch TV or whatever.  That way, even the stupidest sub-human primates can log on, activate autoplay, and come back to a fully leveled 65 toon with 400 AA in a few days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">That way, even the stupidest sub-human primates can log on, activate autoplay, and come back to a fully leveled 65 toon with 400 AA in a few days. <br />
<br />
People keep spewing this shit, but seriously, how fucking hard was the system before?  If you think this makes it soooo much easier, you really should look at how slow you must be to think it's diffcult, or stopped newbs in the old way.<br />
<br />
Idiotic newbs have been able to level to max level for a long time now, switching the way information is displayed doesn't change shit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Azaza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">It encourages having less thoughtful thinking ability by not looking anything up.<br />
<br />
Another step into the trigger happy, click-and- presto, short attention span, 'I want it now' type of mentality that cheapens the game.<br />
<br />
Hell, i get pissed when even guildies ask the simplest questions that they'd have answers to if they even looked at the message board or the motd. Simple answers like, what time is the raid?<br />
<br />
These little changes in terminology only help the 'simple' folk continue to play with that much less effort and spark between neurons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Tarkas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I think they were just tired of 200 different variations of FT/regen/+atk floating around in the spdat and eating system resources. Good change in the long run IMO.<br />
<br />
BTW you didn't need to look anything up currently since it was already printed neatly at the bottom of the item tag what the effect does..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Dafrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">As someone who likes the aspects of roleplaying, and fantasy I have to agree I prefer terms and words that give flavor and character to a fantasy environment. The words &quot;vengeance &quot;, and &quot;flowing thought&quot; certainly appeal my fantasy paradigm than what they changed it to. Yes, they mean the same thing, but no it doesn't provide the flavor I would expect from a fantasy world.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Yes, they mean the same thing, but no it doesn't provide the flavor I would expect from a fantasy world. <br />
<br />
Well put...exactly my thoughts as well.<br />
<br />
The way things read now they may as well as put the database table names in the description (or better yet HTML links to Lucy!), then again I was around 4+ years ago and remember when the whole game was a mystery so I might have sensitivity to this issue others may not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Tugurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I dont' think it makes any actual difference, but it's certainly less cool.<br />
<br />
Flowing Thought II just sounds more fun than Mana Regeneration +2. It's an immersion thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Gasmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I like the fact that they listed haste %'s on items, that's 90% of bazaar spam cut down.... so you would think, but sure as hell I walk into bazaar and Random_nebw_002 says /ooc haste % on Flowing Black Silk Sash ? Some people are just too dumb for there own good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I think adding haste% is fine, but looking it up or asking someone wasn't too challenging, pretty much if you ask the haste% on an item in ooc someone will respond.  But I really think the mana regeneration +1, etc, is corny.  Flowing thought just sounded cool, it sounded like a D&amp;D type term, or something out of an RPG.  Mana Regeneration just sounds gimp.  My wife disagreed with me, she said that it is a good thing, because it's more representative of what the item does.  Well...  by the time you have access to Flowing Thought, oh wait, Mana Regeneration items, you should damn well know what they are.  Now we'll have to say, I got this l33t new item with MR3 instead of FT3.  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">From the patch message: &quot;The effects on the item have not changed they are just set up in a new way that we hope will allow for more item functionality in the future.&quot;<br />
<br />
Personally, I don't give a damn what the effects are called.  If this lets them do more stuff with items down the road, I'm all for it.  If people are that upset by the nomenclature, I'm sure they could change the description to &quot;Flowing Thought: +1&quot;...  It's the same thing.</div></div><hr />

Except that if you say that someone might think you mean SV MAGIC +3 (MR = magic resistance), after all they call resists FR, CR, PR, DR, and MR on many places. It'll probably have to be something silly like MReg or ManaR to be explicitly clear. :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Dakryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Flowing Thought II just sounds more fun than Mana Regeneration +2. It's an immersion thing. <br />
<br />
Bingo...Im going to miss &quot;Aura of _____&quot; listed on items.&quot;<br />
<br />
Attack 20<br />
Regen 2<br />
<br />
Just doesnt look as cool.<br />
Only good thing from patch was showing the haste %</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Velk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I agree on the immersion factor. That was part of what killed AO and AC2 - just having everything so generic was boring and pointless.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, having to go out of game to look up the stats of stuff was also silly. This wasn't really any different to showeq in principle - using a 3rd party program to gain an advantage over other people who didn't. IMO they should have just updated the descriptions for all of the effects so that they were accurate.<br />
<br />
Of course, doing it this way also gave them the ability to nerf twinking further - notice how atk, mana regen, regen etc are now affected by recommended level ? 8)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>FulorianC</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Ditto. We don't want a bunch of cold stats.<br />
<br />
Aura of Bravery. Whoa, cool.<br />
<br />
+3 regeneration of dorkiness<br />
+30 atk of sv vs Gnoll<br />
<br />
Its too.. D&amp;D... The effects give it some life, some personality.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Froggerx Xreggorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">If enough people /feedback it, i'm sure theres a posibility change might be made, I myself already did this, the haste %'ages are fine (that way you know what your getting, instead of 2nd guessing off of people who parse)...<br />
<br />
Another new and very ANNOYING change they have is the damn tribute npc's, they need to make an ON / OFF switch as they have for leadership aa.  Hell trying to conserve my points i take them all off while doing nothing but lfg, then when i get a ldon hard group, god trial etc... I have to run all the way to gukta then to the back to the zone then back to the wayfarer camp or zone that I'm intending on grouping in.   Its retarted and a waste of time... Or maybe i'm just bitching because i'm lazy and the type of person who buys ports from bazaar to nexus.<br />
<br />
<br />
but I truly think they need to just add an on/off switch and universal tribute npc in PoK or PoT.<br />
<br />
note: Horn of Hsraga = 45k tribute!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">well its good they did something with haste. i mean i dont mind looking up what aura of battle means on lucy or something. but since a haste 41 and a haste 16 item both said the same thing on them &quot;haste&quot; it made it difficult to look up. you know those haste augs you buy in ldon? you look up &quot;haste&quot; on lucy and it says 50 percent and then you take a week off work to look it up in as many places as you can and finally learn that the haste is (maybe) 36 percent and think .... shouldnt the stat have just been put right there on the item?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Dragan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">While we're at it, let's feedback to have SOE remove those other cold numbers on items, like HP: +45 and STR: +4 and hide them behind &quot;cool&quot; designations.

<br />
You are thinking about that the wrong way, probably just trying to be funny.<br />
<br />
Consider them removing all character stat mods (str,dex,agi etc) from items entirely and replacing them with hp, mana, atk or ac.  The net effect of the items would be exactly the same, but they would sure as hell be a lot more boring.<br />
<br />
Here's a basic example :<br />
<br />
Shortsword of the Ykesha - effect Ykesha<br />
<br />
Shortsword of Magic Damage - effect: 75 magic damage<br />
<br />
They are the same, but which is more interesting ? Which fires your imagination more ?<br />
<br />
I don't know if you played AO, but upgrading your rifle quality 117 to an identical rifle quality 120 just had no appeal compared to individual items with a unique lore about them.</div></div><hr />
