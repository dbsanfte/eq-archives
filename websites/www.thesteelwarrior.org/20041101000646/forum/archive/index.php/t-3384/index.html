   First off, I play a Wizard as main (hold punches plz), but enjoy the totally opposite role of playing my big Ogre from time to time.  So... what suggestions you all have for equipment upgrades, or items i could just nuke for w/ a lvl60 wizard?  The rings, earrings, neck, and waist are my general twink items that I transfer between characters, but I'm ready to drop about 10-15k on my tank and update his gear.  Here's a link to his gear:<br />

You could buy the belt, but you would be better off spending that money on cultural armor.  (which is getting really cheap nowadays)  That should hold you for quite a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>sporadic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i kinda screwed up the cultural stuff.... i'm agnostic i think.. will check for sure when i logon :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sardonus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">heh does every wizard run an ogre tank as alt? That's exactly what I made. Agnostic too although I wish I'd made him after deities mattered so I'd have known there was actually an advantage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>sporadic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i think it has something to do w/ going from one extreme to the other. either full tank or full caster :)</div></div><hr />
