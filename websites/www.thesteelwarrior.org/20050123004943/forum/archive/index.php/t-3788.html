<br />
We had two rogues, two necromancers, a warrior, a paladin, a shaman, and a cleric: all high end luclin and/or elemental level folks. Hoshkar got down to a shocking 98 percent at one point in the five plus minute battle. When I finally died he was at 100 percent again. <br />
<br />
Is it a bug that he can out-regenerate that kind of dps? I honestly do not believe that a 50 man Kunark era guild could hold a candle to the dps we had there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh, uh...hijack off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dubb</div><div class="date">10-21-2003, 03:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bugged for sure if that was the case.<br />
<br />
I miss Hoshbag, too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tima</div><div class="date">10-21-2003, 08:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">His regen was that way for us when we took 9 folks to Vp a couple months back. We were all decked out in Elemental gear and weps, and the lowest we got him was 94%. Ended up taking about 2 and a half groups to start making headway with him.<br />
<br />
I think thats the norm for him now ever since the partial &quot;revamp&quot; of Veeshan's Peak a while back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greyslayer</div><div class="date">10-21-2003, 10:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's just a bug usually have to petition to have a GM kill him and when he spawns again he'll be fine.  Same thing can happen with Guardian Wurms that hit for like 1600 they got uber regen to and an AE Dispell :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tierleaf</div><div class="date">10-22-2003, 04:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Always had quick regeneration like that as far as I remember. never meant to be 1 grouped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dubb</div><div class="date">10-22-2003, 05:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">He never had regen like THAT, heh. 9 people elemental geared couldn't get him below 94%?  We used to take him out with pretty small crews before Luclin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kogur</div><div class="date">10-22-2003, 05:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just don't see how a guild with reasonable numbers could have defeated him when the DPS we had, 3 expansions later, should totally eclipse what they could have mustered.<br />
<br />
One rogue was using a dart of immobility and a khalazhar while the other was using a wicked shank and a gargoyle talon. The pally was using some weapon from the elementals and I, the warrior, was using staff of 4 winds. Then of course you have the necros both with their lvl 65 pets and all lvl 65 spells. <br />
<br />
I would guess he's surely bugged. I suppose I will petition tonight and see if I can determine if that's just truly the way he is meant to be or not.<br />
<br />
We knew we weren't going to be able to last forever due to only having one cleric and one shaman for heals. However, we were quite sure we could eat through 32kHP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raaj</div><div class="date">10-22-2003, 05:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">He can be bugged. He likely was. Lots of VP mobs have that problem occasionally. It has to do with their regen going up exponentially.<br />
<br />
Hoshkar does have high normal regen, though.</div></div><hr />
