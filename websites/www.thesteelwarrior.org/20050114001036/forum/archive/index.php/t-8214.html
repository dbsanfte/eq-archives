<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ciae Redemption</div><div class="date">07-23-2004, 05:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's been a lot of threads arguing whether Gates is good for &quot;casuals&quot; and the debate has mostly boiled down to single group content. Your server may vary and it might be hard to actually group in some of these places (Maelin is an extremely top-heavy server, for one), but it isn't fair to just ignore and dismiss the content that exists in these zones. I've made up a magelo (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1071587) of items that come entirely from GoD single groups. Nothing beyond Tipt, nothing LDoN, just Natimbi, Qinimi, Barindu, Ferubi, Riwwi, and the surrounding instanced zones. Like Frodlin said, there's a GOLDMINE of gear in Gates, though not quite enough to skip six expansions (nor should there be). Gates single-group weapons, for example, need more variety. If a weapon on par with GBoS dropped in Barindu/Riwwi, people would use those zones more. <br />
<br />
Also note that I didn't include a Breakdown in Communications augment, since due to the flawed design in that quest, the first parts aren't single groupable and are much harder than a number of the later parts of the quest. It doesn't matter that a single group can do parts #3 and 5-8 because having just those parts done doesn't matter; it isn't possible for a single group to complete parts #1, 2, and 4, and so the Socketed White Crystal is useless for this thread.<br />
<br />
Over 7000 unbuffed HP isn't bad for entirely non-raider content out of ONE expansion. Now add some buffs:<br />
<br />
PoP: 7268 (base) + 618 (Nine) + 544 (Seven) + 910 (Kazad) + 330 (Brell) = 9670hp<br />
<br />
OoW: 7268 (base) + 805 (Steeloak) + 707 (Wanvu) + 1185 (Balikor) + 430 (Brell) = 10395hp<br />
<br />
Let's go even further and add some augs, all obtained from Gates; not a single Adventure Point is needed for any of the augs listed in the above magelo, for an increase of 367hp and 47ac.<br />
<br />
PoP: 9670 (buffed) + 367 = 10037hp<br />
<br />
OoW: 10395 (buffed) + 367 = 10762hp<br />
<br />
Ten thousand hitpoints, without ever raiding, without ever setting foot in LDoN, without ever setting foot *anywhere* except Gates of Discord. That doesn't include the extra HP from a stamina buff, since I don't know how much of an increase it would be (I'm a cleric). It's a little light on AC, but this is only one expansion. A loyalist shield, for example, could help fix that.<br />

Drops from Zun'Muram Votal, one of the raidmobs in Ferubi (roughly an EP - difficulty raid due to his two guards, his DPS isn't too big itself, apart from his proc. Positioning and learning where you can fight him takes a try or two, to avoid leashing).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have a question though.  The Sash of the Yunjo's Champion is part of the BiC, past some of the non-single groupable sections, the Qinimi raid to be specific.  I was wondering if the part of the quest to obtain this, Riwwi Colisseum fights, can be done seperately from the rest of the BiC quest?  Also can it be done multiple times so that you can receive both the Champion's Sash and the Silvery Mesh Sash?<br />
<br />
I'd also like to point out that five of the items that you listed in the magelo drop off of random trash mobs and are, in my experience, EXTREMELY rare.  So it's not like all of these items are easily obtainable, they require alot of time and effort.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raunstonecutter</div><div class="date">07-24-2004, 11:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Great Post!  Awsome info =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ciae Redemption</div><div class="date">07-25-2004, 05:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Every part of the BiC quest can be done separately from the others. The only reason the order matters is that for every portion of the quest you finish, you get a gem shard. Combining the Socketed White Crystal with the gem shards in the correct order makes the BiC augment.<br />
<br />
Sashes 9 and 10 are on the list because the 10th battle is much harder than the rest (3 unmezzable ukun + 3 mezzable aneuk) and the stats on both are very similar. I don't think the quest can be repeated to get a 9th and 10th sash.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ciae Redemption</div><div class="date">07-26-2004, 02:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I made the magelo before I made the list, so it's not quite the most hp/ac possible. I had already done the buff calculations when I saw the cloak from Vxed, that I decided a few more hp wasn't worth doing the math over again. With OoW buffs and 305 stamina though, that optimum setup would be close to 11k hitpoints.<br />
<br />
what level does this single group need to be?<br />
<br />
Since the zones vary so greatly in difficulty, you can progress in those zones. Qinimi is easier than Riwwi is easier than Barindu is easier than Ferubi is easier than Vxed is easier than Tipt. Sewers difficulty varies from about Riwwi to about Vxed. The real value in this lies in the fact that if Tipt or Vxed is too hard for you (or your usual group, if you have one), you can gear up in Ferubi or Barindu. If Ferubi is too hard for you, you can gear up in Riwwi or Qinimi. There's 6 other expansions worth of other upgrade paths as well, but Gates provides options everywhere from bazaar gear to post-time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 Curious what sort of HP/AC I should shoot for tho, to have a shot in hell at PU groups, as my guild has avoided GoD like the plague. (When I quit playing to enter CoH beta, I was the only one in my guild who had bought it, and I haven't heard of any folks buying it.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">07-26-2004, 02:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just out of curiosity, what level does this single group need to be?

<br />
Depends what you are talking about ... if you have all your defensive aa's then i'd say you put up a fighting chance in the sewer trials but will have difficuly in the mountains.  Ferubi is rather easy as long as you bring good crowd control and dps ... none of the monsters put out that much dps until you hit the yellow/white cons.  Named, on the other hand, are quite a different story.<br />
<br />
If you can do hard LDoN without too many problems then you should do fine in the sewer 1-4 trials.  If you can do Hard LDoN very easily then you should put up at least a fighting chance in the mountains.<br />
<br />
As always, though, a talented healer and a great group can make up for any short-comings on the gear side.<br />
<br />
*edit- just looked at your magelo.  At under 5k hps and 0 aa's you will most likely have some serious problems in GoD trials, though you still will probably do just fine in qinimi and on mini named and xp crawls through ferubi (as long as your group is good).  I would shoot for another 1k hps, another 300ish ac before you delve into the trials.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Argin</div><div class="date">07-26-2004, 04:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Very nice list, but just as a side note, I don't see Whimsey of the Masters getting used a whole lot if a warrior has, say, 4 or more PoP flags, or journal of the vagabond with good begging/alcohol tolerance skill, and a decent ldon charm aug, since you'd have to pick one charm to aug with adventurer's stone, and many people would probably aug the one with static stats, even if theyre lower that the maximum whisey stats.  I'm guessing that stats reset whenever you die or get rezzed, so could be a real pain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arathena</div><div class="date">07-26-2004, 05:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A glance at your magelo, Partha, and I'm thinking you should probably be okay through Barindu, but you'll definitely need /discs for the nameds. It'll be a definite challenge, though. I do reasonably well in Ferubi at 5.7/1500 ish unbuffed + Full Defensive AA, but it's rough going. Of the sewers, the Crematory is the 'medium' LDoN that everyone wishes existed, and the pools and lair are somewhere above BoT but beneath the Eles, while the Purifying Plant is just an asskicker. As a warrior, I'd want 6k/1400+ AC to work with even bare minimum comfort in the Plant. I can't comment on Vxed/Tipt, other than to say that the two times I went to Vxed, I hid behind a guild warrior, and she took a royal beating at a buffed 9k/1600ish AC.</div></div><hr />

If you follow the progression and pick up the various augs that are available, you should be able to get more gear out of the Kod'Taz trials and random named in the zone. You would pretty much max out here, but you would still be able to build a pretty stout warrior.</div></div><hr />

For instance I'd love to get that shoulder item from Ferubi but it's incredibly rare.  I've done numerous grind groups there and only ever seen one drop that way.

I am MA for a guild that JUST got elemental flaged, most of my gear is from GoD 1 group mobs.  Threw on the 40HP augments, and 10ac augments to make it a tad better.<br />

It's very frustrating as a warrior because out side of keeping aggro lots of times you have no control over anything but aggro (and that's shakey sometimes)<br />
<br />
So in GoD if your puller is bad....whipe<br />
                if your cleric is bad.....whipe<br />
                if your crowd control is bad..whipe<br />
                if your snarer is bad..whipe.<br />
<br />
And oftentimes ya don't have control over who your group is unless you are the one putting them together.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Partha</div><div class="date">08-20-2004, 06:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A glance at your magelo, Partha, and I'm thinking you should probably be okay through Barindu, but you'll definitely need /discs for the nameds. It'll be a definite challenge, though. I do reasonably well in Ferubi at 5.7/1500 ish unbuffed + Full Defensive AA, but it's rough going. Of the sewers, the Crematory is the 'medium' LDoN that everyone wishes existed, and the pools and lair are somewhere above BoT but beneath the Eles, while the Purifying Plant is just an asskicker. As a warrior, I'd want 6k/1400+ AC to work with even bare minimum comfort in the Plant. I can't comment on Vxed/Tipt, other than to say that the two times I went to Vxed, I hid behind a guild warrior, and she took a royal beating at a buffed 9k/1600ish AC.<br />
<br />
 Okay, just did a group in GoD yesterday. Group was WAR/SK/DRU/SHM/BRD/ENC, the other five being solid EPish geared toons. The only Magelo I can find of them is the Bard's (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=893852) . The rest of the group is similarly geared/AA'd, I believe.<br />
<br />
(Of course, they went to Purifying Plant.)  :eek: <br />
<br />
 With this group, I was able to tank trash mobs just fine, which surprised me greatly, given what I've heard about GoD. Mobs tended to hit in the 700-950 range max, which compares with Hard LDoN to me. Sadly, we were not able to attempt the named, due to the Druid's untimely death in a bad spot, followed by time constraints with other folks in the group. All in all, though, it was highly educational. The SK was originally tanking, then they had me take over while he was AFK for a few mobs. I'm sure I would not have done nearly as well with a lesser geared group, however.</div></div><hr />

I was surprised to see just how high they could go.<br />
<br />
First off, this is based on the idea that everything listed in Ciae's list can indeed be gotten by one group without raiding.  I'm hoping Haas can prove that right or wrong.<br />
<br />
I went ahead and stuck the Adventurer's stone to 100%, since I'm getting the max capable stats.<br />
<br />
Maxed out hp AAs, added augs.  Here's the Magelo (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1034967).  ~8k hp unbuffed is pretty darn nice.  You can even get slightly higher if you get some Velium Gemmed weapons instead (less agro procs though), or decide to raid small bit and try to pick up a Cipher of Veeshan.  I think the GBoS can be one-grouped by now.<br />
<br />
I couldn't think of a better helm (other than Rallos Helm).  Ciae listed the Miremuck one, but since I don't know for sure where it's gotten I left it off.  I know Iksars have higher AC than others, so you might want to adjust for that (I think it's 50ac?  I like Iksars, so I used one)  With a clicky bramblecoat, you can get this guy's AC up to over 1700 (maybe mid 1600s on others).  I chose the AC augs from LDoN for those slots also, instead of just looking for highest hp.<br />
<br />
Maybe someone can suggest some better items for a LDoN/GoD hybrid?  I'm not going pure hp, but high hp with a good AC as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fynepisa</div><div class="date">08-24-2004, 04:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, it includes items that are outside of GoD, but I actually don't raid and have aquired everything through bazaar/ldon/GoD (see side magelo). If you include KT/Ikkinz, you can do very well, and if you can beat tipt for the bracer than you should be able to get the KT/Ikkinz stuff with a little work. Also, there are some alternate profiles on my profile that are even better that simply have more of the named and trash drops from GoD.</div></div><hr />

The aug you're thinking of Ejryu is Faceted Gem of Might, 20hp type7 non-lore augment from Tumia Lehio in Natimbi, same slots as the Stone Shard of Fortitude.</div></div><hr />

I got in OoW beta and made a beta buffed warrior and was impressed with his ability with Ornate.  He's got 8k unbuffed at level 70 and I was like damn, I want this on live so I been playing warrior again a little.  <br />
<br />
It's been my experience so far that GoD groups want 9k unbuffed warriors on my server.  I am FAR from this.  I did get into one GoD group, consisting of all people that weren't experienced in GoD.  We made it to Qin and did one of the sepwers that someone recomended.  We didn't even get to the second room.  <br />
<br />
I'm working on maxing my defensive aa's, 82 atm, up to LR2 or 3, I forget.  Hopefully one day I will be able to get groups in GoD for some nice upgrades, for now I am exping in BoT.  I am Tactics falgged and would love groups there but no does groups there which is sad, cause it's a great zone for exp.  Trying to finish Sol Ro flag but I get very frustrated at the low discipline level and disorganisation of Pick Up raids.  One day.   :mad:</div></div><hr />

Ikkinz trials are still hard with time gear.  It's doable without raiding but it damned sure won't be easy.  I think for most casuals the list should basically stop at KT and yxxta single group stuff.  A non raider would have to be VERY motivated to get much farther before OOW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kendolekk</div><div class="date">09-04-2004, 03:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I ventured into GoD today, for the first serious effort I have given it myself.<br />
<br />
I 4 box my Warrior, Cleric, Chanter, and Monk. I have the basics, but it's utility I lack. For the longest time, I wrote off GoD due to the inconvenience of it all. The run there sucks, I lack utility of things such as snare, evac, group invis, etc. After today, I'll learn to deal with the convenience issue.<br />
<br />
I marched into Barindu today, and went for the Sewers. From what I read, Plant hit the hardest, but things were single pullable, and didn't run. I'd like to think I'm a solid tank, so I decided this trial would be my best bet. Originally, I figured I'd just go in, see if I could stay alive, and after that see if I could get some reasonable XP. I got in, and I was surprised that once slowed, the mobs were cake at best. The only death I had occured when the chanter got agro and died on tash. I went on to tank it unslowed and live just fine, regardless.<br />
<br />
After a half an hour or so (yea, my dps is somewhat lacking) the named spawn. Kri V'lak, to be specific. I figured &quot;What the hell? The mask is nice, and my monk could use the staff.&quot; Now, I really had no hopes of actually making it to the named. From what I hear, most people just invis/paci to the named. I can't do this. Lack of group invis, and the fact that I have to move 4 characters at once just doesn't appeal to me. I decided that I had the time, and could use the XP, so I cleared to the named. Surprisingly, the only trouble I had was the unslowable abandoned workers. They hit like mack trucks.<br />
<br />
All went well, and I got to and killed the named no problem. The whole deal, including the run to Barindu (see invis mob cause a death otw), took me roughly 3 hours. Now, 3 hours for the 1 or so AA didn't seem amazing, but the fun I had, combined with the chance of loot (Kri V'lak dropped chains arms, which rotted), and the XP, made it worth it in the end.<br />
<br />
I'll definately be going back, and once I figure out how to reliably deal with mobs that flee, I will be headed to lair for a few items I need. My only regrets about GoD, is I didn't explore it sooner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gobsmash Emgood</div><div class="date">09-12-2004, 03:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">2 things that can help fleeing mobs are haveing a snare weapon off handed on warrior or the monk and haveing your cleric ready to assist your warrior and cast a stun or 2 and or root.
