<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Athrias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Crown of Deception (Woodelf) and an Amulet of Necropotence (skelly) are about the only easy-to-obtain illusion items with permanant charges for a warrior thus far as I have found. There is a human one that drops in VT if your guild is that high. <br />
<br />
There are a few with charges (one turns you into a tree) but those are no fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">the guktan stone was changed to no charges. kinda simple to get. mightneed a healer for some of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mathas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There's also an item off a one-group named in poearth with unlimited charges of Illusion:  Earth Elemental.  Obvious catch is that you must be elemental flagged.<br />
<br />
For shrink items, there's the standard old Cobalt Bracer, there's a bracelet in VT, Wand of Imperceptibility (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=19725) from the Deep, or a range item off the new Bristlebane in PoMischief.  The wand from the deep is easily duoed at 65, if you don't want to spend money on the cobalt bracer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That guktan stone was part of the quest for enchanters to get the guktan illusion SPELL. So if the item is unlimited charges of the spell it's supposed to help you quest, then there's really no point in continuing on or finishing the quest. Just get the stone and be done.<br />

If that were true, the pre-nerf guise would not be part of the casino rewards. Some other item would be.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>FulorianC</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Being Elementally flagged has almost nothing to do with getting the Earth elemental illusion stone. That is one of the most rare items in the game, I don't think theres even one on Xegony. Its a rare rare drop off a trap mob named that I don't think most people even know where it can be spawned.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I've never seen one either.<br />
<br />
Next rarest would be the ranger pet weapon.  As far as I know, there's still only one on my server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Choppin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">3 earth illusion stones in my guild, pretty sure it's the only 3 on the server. korascian warlord usually drops the cloak, and I've only seen it spawn on a server reset.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">&quot;If what were true?&quot;<br />
<br />
If these things were true:<br />
<br />
A- That the guise of the deceiver had any sort of intrinsic &quot;cool&quot; value.<br />
B- That the guise of the deceiver lost its &quot;cool&quot; value by people farming it.<br />
C- That the change to the guise was made because of it losing its &quot;cool&quot; value.<br />
D- That changes made to all illusion items revolve around their &quot;cool&quot; value.<br />
<br />
As one can plainly see, the guktan illusion stone FIX was made not to nerf anything, but to fix the quest. It's supposed to be a one charge item that the quester uses in their QUEST to gain the spell. The quest wasn't implemented properly. It had nothing to do with cool value of illusions or illusion items.<br />
<br />
The existence of the Crown of Deceit also indicates that &quot;cool&quot; value of being able to transform oneself's appearance has no bearing on why SOE makes its gear decisions. Or else the woodie crown wouldn't even exist.<br />
<br />
The stone was supposed to be a one shot item to help the chanters do their quest. That's it. It wasn't. They eventually fixed it so it was.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No you misunderstand. I'm willing to bet money that they changed the existing guktan stones to 255 charges instead of keeping them infinite (like the guise, replaced with MoD) because they didn't want to piss off the non-enchanters who had done the quest *too* much...<br />
<br />
Reason they didn't just replace the guise in everyone's inventory with a MoD, or just remove it? Beats me, maybe they weren't able to at the time, but my money says they didn't want to take away something &quot;cool&quot; from the non-bard/rogs because it had already been broken for too long.<br />
<br />
And obviously they brought the guise back to the casino because there aren't many originals left. Hence, it's &quot;cool&quot; to own one again, old school or casino gambler.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Yet another example of why the &quot;cool&quot; factor doesn't play into this decision:<br />
<br />
If I REALLY wanted to be a dark elf all the time, and didn't feel like blowing 300k or so at the casino ... I'd just go buy the potions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Nord</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">As far as the Froggy Stone goes, it does have one charge but I believe you can get it recharged simply by handing it back into the quest-giver.  A handy little toy.</div></div><hr />

How convenient  :( Running back to get it re-charged everytime you use it.</div></div><hr />

Trap spawn is at the SE corner of Peregrin temple - there, they know now =)</div></div><hr />

hahahahahahahah.<br />
<br />
I hate earth named &quot;spawns&quot; like that.<br />
<br />
Does anyone on Povar even have the monk pet weapon, btw?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Dubb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">All earth named are spawned via traps... except Tantisala, the rings, and Arbitor. The frog (and other trap types) have multiple locations, too. The one Derrict mentioned isn't the only spot to spawn Korascian Warlord.<br />
<br />
I &lt;3 being an earth elemental :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">At least 6 earth stones on Bristlebane I know of.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Dubb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">AFAIK, there aren't any on Morell-Thule. Mine's the only I personally know of on Druzzil, but I'm unsure how many may be floating around. One thing's for sure - it's a rare drop. I must've killed the warlord 30 times before I finally saw one drop. In that time I've seen 3 ranger whips, 2 monk swarm weapons, and a couple dozen each of the other more common drops like masks, rings, cloaks, ranges, ent leaf.</div></div><hr />
