<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Blackmantis monkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've lurked the steel warrior for a while now, and this is my first post. I'm a monk, but not a crybaby monk, so no monk jokes, please.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I've been through this forum and used the search feature and can't seem to find any decent twink equipment listing. I am planning on pretty well kitting out a warrior at level 1. I have a decent ammount of plat to spend, and some favors to call in from friends.<br />
<br />
Now before you get all up in arms about this and start calling me a twink and bashing me for using my resources let me explain my goal here. I want to make a good tank to act as an anchor for a group of lowbies. I'm planning to take this warrior into lowbie zones and recruit groups of low levels to go and play eq like it used to be in the good old days. We are talking karanas bandit camps, solA, upper/lower guk, paw, befallen. The fun zones that none of todays PoP tarts never get to see. I think that if they group with me and know I'm reliable, they will be inclined to come with me on these adventures. This twink will be more of an outreach project than a twinked bot to level up as fast as possible.<br />
<br />
so, all that said, I'm looking for some advice on what gear is best without a rec level. I play a monk/shaman/cleric so anything that drops in Umbral is easily within reach and RC/Doomshade is also an option with help from friends. I was planning on a Vindy BP and maybe some boots if he would ever drop them. KT axe I'm trying to get ahold of, but I'm thinking 1 handers will be better aggro and dps at low levels. RZ diety and fierce heraldic armor is an option, but how much af a hp hit is it at low levels?<br />
<br />
I'll rough out a list here.<br />
<br />
Head: fierce? possible tormax crown<br />
Neck: neck from VaDyn or fierce/65hp<br />
Face: ?<br />
Ears: 35hp? not gonna pony up for ct earring<br />
Shoulder: I have chokidai hide pauldrons<br />
Back: Heiro<br />
Chest: Vindy<br />
Waist: RBG I have on a twink<br />
Legs: Fierce?<br />
Boots: Vindy/fierce<br />
Bracers: I have a bracer of fort but maybe fierce x2<br />
Gaunts: 80hp ones from kael or maybe fierce. When can you MQ skyshrine?<br />
Rings: 6/65<br />
Range: some kind of bow maybe to snag agro<br />
Weapons: No idea here, not gonna be able to swing BoC/SoD. Maybe Umbral weapons, tormax axe possible, What's best droppable combo or 2 hand with no rec level? Maybe willsapper or wavecrasher. I'd think a top end dps combo would be enough agro just from dps at low level.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any help<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Cenyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Swiftblade of Zek and Horn of Hsagra should be good at low levels, 175 hp, 15 total stamina(i think, forgot if SoZ is str or sta) and 35 ac from the HoH can't be beat.<br />
<br />
Ears, maybe one -15 ac, 75 hp earring... you will have enough AC for the low levels for the ac hit until higher levels.<br />
<br />
<br />
BTW, i don't feel you should have to defend why you are twinking.  It is your money/time, play the game how you feel like</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Frostpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think you are right on track with the 2 1 handers from UP. They're free (Shadowheart and Mith Short Sword) and have no rec level. Those will be plenty of agro and nice dps till level 45+ when a lot of proccing weaps start to work for ya. For 2 hander id look for a Reaver.</div></div><hr />
