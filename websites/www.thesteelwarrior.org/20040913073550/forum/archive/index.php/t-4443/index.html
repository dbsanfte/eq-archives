<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>gwarf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">basically as a tank fights he can chain moves<br />
<br />
for example if you parry, and then quickly hit a button, you can perform a move that requires parry and that move will do extra damage.<br />
<br />
If you get that second move off you can quickly do  a third move if your fingers are fast enough<br />
<br />
however it seems Sony will give us with slower reflexes more of a warning and allow us to choose a move with more time than Camelots 3 second window.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I played a warrior on DaoC to level 25 or so.  I liked it, a lot.  The only reason I didn't keep playing DaoC was lack of interest from other people I played with and lack of interesting content.<br />
<br />
There are certain moves in DaoC that can only be executed from the back, or from the side, or only after a successful block with a shield (shields are way better in DaoC), or after executing a parry, etc.  You gain certain types of combat moves as your skills go up.  Shields are the same way, the more shield skill you have, the better shield skills you have.<br />
<br />
I would like it if they made similiar changes to EQ.  However, it would require more involvement in our playing, more interaction.  That is good and bad, in that if we want to kick back and just hit attack we'd lose efficiency, where as now we just have to hit kick once in awhile, the new way we'd have to learn the different styles and constantly be using them.  I would like this kind of change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fenring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Never played DAoC, so I can't compare, my concern is how often these openings present themselves, if they are like procs then they will do very little as far as class balance and only make our jobs harder. I'm not an autoattack go afk type person so I don't mind working harder but it better be for a damn good reason.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">it's really not like a proc; more of the RNG calculating a chance for a special attack.<br />
<br />
I played a 'zerker in DAoC; and from what i rememebr it would look liek this :<br />
<br />
Shikarii hit a blahblah for 10 melee damage<br />
a blahblah tries to hit you, but you PARRY!<br />
this is when you would hit your special ability key<br />
some crazy exploding sound<br />
Shikarii hits a blahblah of &lt;spec attack&gt; damage<br />
Shikairi hit a blahblah for 10 damage<br />
<br />
Know how most of us have all the other combat effects off like riposte and parry? If it works like that and not using an on-screen visual of the necessary skill needed to enable the spec attack; we might have to turn on the others messages about our skills ( or just make a new set of text combat filters for it .<br />
<br />
<br />
DISCLAIMER: this is only speculation on my part about what it might be.</div></div><hr />

Going to see a new breed of warriors emerge... the RNG-Warrior, not the LFG-Warrior.. HAHAHA<br />
<br />
Some time ago I read an article about computer generated RNG's and how it was possible to create a seemingly random number but if the numbers were tallied and enough rolls were made then each number would actually have the same hit count after an infinite time.  This in its self makes the random aspect not random but &quot;appear&quot; to be random.  <br />
<br />
Anyways, im rambling... I should get back to work...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Blah, I hope we don't get turned into bards, having to &quot;twist&quot; all manner of special attacks. I really just wanted my taunt button to work a little better, and maybe a little better DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>gwarf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">yeah no kidding<br />
<br />
they still havent fixed what is truly wrong<br />
<br />
also disciplines need to be made into buttons that gray out on use</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'm wondering what role lag is going to play in all this. Right now I have to run with all spells off to avoid the occasional slow-motion effects. If a special attack opportunity were to come up during high lag I'm quite positive that I would miss it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Thaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I know, all of us shitty computer-ed people need some lubin!!</div></div><hr />

The worst part was when you ran out of endurance, you could do almost nothing - And getting aggro ? forget it if you have an empty stamina bar.<br />
<br />
So you were fucked if you used them a lot and the others were fucked if you didn't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Bonequest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">&quot;Some time ago I read an article about computer generated RNG's and how it was possible to create a seemingly random number but if the numbers were tallied and enough rolls were made then each number would actually have the same hit count after an infinite time.

It has been a few years since I took a course on this but basically this is how I understand it:<br />
<br />
Basically, there are no truly random numbers generated by general purpose computers.  The reason is that there is not an efficient way to cheaply utilize a random effect to create truly random numbers.  To actually do that you would need something like a small radioactive peice of material and a geiger counter or some similar setup incorporated on the motherboard.  This would be too expensive and not really worth doing for most things.  There probably are computers like this at places like the NSA but don't expect to walk into Best Buy and get a random number co-processor because it would probably cost a few million dollars.<br />
<br />
Instead, what is usually done for speed and efficiency reasons is a relatively large number (call it the base number) is picked and an algorithm is used that uses the mod function and a seed number to generate psuedo-random numbers in a cyclic fashion (the sequence repeats after a while).  In most of the common algorithms, the numbers will fall along a series of parallel straight lines if you plot the Nth number vs the (N+1)th numbers of the sequence in a plane and for this reason, this is called a linear method.  This method is fairly good at producing what appear to be random numbers to the human eye but actually are not.  The problem is that if you use the same seed value, you get the same sequence of numbers and if you use too small of a number for the base number, the cycle of pseudo random numbers will repeat too soon.  Certain tricks are often used to offset the repeated seed problem, such as taking the system clock value for the seed and this works fairly well but the seed must have a sufficient number of possible values to be good enough to use (example--you wouldn't want to use a die with 6 sides to pick seeds because you would just get 6 different pseudo-random sequences even though a die roll is a true random process).<br />
<br />
Anyway, here is a better source of information than my limited memory and it details some other methods as well:<br />
<br />

<br />
Here is a cool Java applet to play with the kind of random number generator I described.  Select 2d plot and run it with different values for &quot;a&quot; and then put a small number like 9 for &quot;a&quot; and look at the parallel line pattern it makes.<br />
<br />
http://www.physics.carleton.ca/courses/75.502/slides/java/RandomApplet/RandomApplet.html<br />
<br />
P.S. If you want to get rich, a really good way to do it is to invent a better psuedo-random number generator.</div></div><hr />
