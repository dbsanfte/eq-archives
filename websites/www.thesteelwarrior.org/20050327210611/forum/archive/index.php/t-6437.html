Would you view this as <br />
a) basically a tank item - great AC, good hp and other stats, of a quality found almost nowhere else (is there anything comparable bar the Time-RZ mask?)<br />
<br />
b) basically a cleric item - the biggest beneficial spell haste focus you can get, boosting the speed of every patch heal, and its rare too; only 3 items (pre-GoD) have it, and one of them is on Quarm<br />
<br />
c) open season, these are nice stats and anyone who can use it is entitled?<br />
<br />
Been doing Time for a few weeks and this just dropped for the first time, and feelings were surprisingly mixed on what I thought was a fairly straightforward situation.  Just looking for the viewpoint of some well-informed warriors :)</div></div><hr />

IMO MTs are better off waiting for Veil of Inferno from bertoxx. And if bertoxx is being stingy the mask from RZ is pretty similar stat wise to the faceguard.</div></div><hr />

for the 365 hitpoints maybe?</div></div><hr />

I dont regret it at all, however, i wouldnt mind picking up a veil still if for nothing else the free hp buff.  I think its an open game item though.  <br />
<br />
Nice thing about it is every class listed that can use it has other options too.  So it really wont be too much of an issue in most cases.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Madronedorf</div><div class="date">03-30-2004, 09:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think RZ ring is a better choice for the &quot;Form of&quot; of course the best is Quarm ring, and Veil of Inferno combo but thats 2 buff slots and not exactly easy to get</div></div><hr />

I guess I was asking that because I would prefer RZ form over 180 hitpoints.</div></div><hr />

Once you have been there a few months, so much stuff is going to be rotting it really doesn't matter. We have tier 5 loot going to twinks and a couple weeks ago a fresh recruit who hadn't been in the guild for 2 weeks got a Quarm loot. If you want it, take it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">03-31-2004, 01:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Which quarm loot?  Legs?  Timeweaver?

Problem being that even if youve been farming time for quite a long time its likely the all/all veil and quarm ring are still pretty contested.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sure, until you remember that at that stage clerics should have 23/25% spell haste already, so the increase in speed is nice, but not gamebreaking for fast casting patch heals.<br />

<br />
I see 5 items, none of them from Quarm:<br />
<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/itemswitheffect.html?id=3533<br />
Amulet of Crystal Dreams - PoTime Tallon<br />
Earring of Unseen Horrors - PoTime Cazic<br />
Faceguard of Frenzy - PoTime P3<br />
Gleaming Mesh Girdle - PoFire Fennin<br />
Temporal Chainmail Sleeves - PoTime Vallon<br />
<br />
and another 3 from GoD somewhere presumably:<br />
Aneuk Contemplation Skull  - GoD<br />
Choker of Centaur Slaying - GoD<br />
Illuminated Hammer - GoD<br />
<br />
Absolutely no reason to prioritise an item with a slight increase in a focus they already have, especially when the upgraded focus has 8 chances to drop per PoTime clear.<br />
<br />
A considerably greater case could be made for all PoTime plate BPs going directly to warriors before anyone else. Echo of Anger is unique and has the single greatest raid benefit of any other item in the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Avelariel</div><div class="date">03-31-2004, 03:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You're right that it's 5 not 3 and not from Quarm, I was quoting a slightly incorrect cleric there.  However the Necklace and the Sleeves can't be worn by clerics, so it is only 3 from their point of view.  Majority of clerics i  my guild seem to have 18% bene spell haste.<br />
However, due to restrictions on the focus effect, it doesn't benefit Supernal Remedy, doesn't benefit CH, so basically it only helps on Supernal Light (/Holy Light).  For someone with 18% spell haste already, it speeds up Supernal Light by 0.4 secs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hammer goes to negative points people, stone goes to negative points people, leather bracer goes to negative points people, the legs are just flat out rotting now i think.  <br />
<br />
Couple of the other items are very close too heh</div></div><hr />

Something along those lines anyway.</div></div><hr />

Because you can get a ring that adds +53ac. ok.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Quarm ring stacks with Form effects that don't have overlapping effects.  Apparently it's also stacking with Form of Defense which does overlap.<br />
<br />
We haven't had much luck on Stone of Flowing Times, and same with Leather Bracers.  The most common items we get seems to be Shroud of Eternity, Tailsman of Elements, or Quarm Shawl.  None of those will rot anytime soon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) i was wearing a ToV mask (mask of sky) and was in dire need of an upgrade.<br />
<br />
2) I prefer to get the RZ ring for the ac buff, however i've passed on the first two since i had decent rings atm. Since only one form spell stacks, i would prefer the AC to the extra HP's<br />
<br />
3) We hadn't killed bertox/RZ at the time and didn't feel like waiting.<br />
<br />
I don't regret taking the mask one bit. It's got great ac and i'm thinking of removing the aug i currently have on it and adding an AC aug when i get one :)</div></div><hr />

I was in a hurry, so I didn't have time to edit my post. What I meant to write was, &quot;I'm pretty sure they do [stack].&quot; I remember reading a discussion on the subject, and that stacking them involved clicking Quarm ring first, then the other. Reading from Lucy I really can't tell. It looks like changes were made to EW and all the Forms on the 10th of Feb this year, but I can't decipher it... too tired.<br />
<br />
edit: prolly some info in this (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=5454) thread.</div></div><hr />

My GF has both Quarm ring and Bertie mask and they do stack if you put em on correct order: Ring first then mask. But since Eternal Ward only lasts 20 min and Form of Endurance lasts 36 min, she oftens only has Form of Endurance on - unless she is maintank. <br />

He was refering to the mask and quarm ring.  I'd be very very surprised if the rallos ring and quarm ring stack check out the differances in &quot;stacking on lucy.<br />

One of the two items with Preservation of Mithaniel, the best beneficial spell mana preservation available.<br />
<br />
It is a great cleric item, yet also a great tank item because of its 45ac and 190hp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">04-09-2004, 01:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">IMO trying to assign a class best suited by anything that drops in Time is useless. Look at it realistically - once you can beat time, you basically get 40ish pieces of loot for about 5 hours effort every 6 days. Who cares what class an item is better for, in about 3 months everyone is going to have Time loot coming out of their arses. Take what ever suits you, most stuff will be rotting soon enough.</div></div><hr />
