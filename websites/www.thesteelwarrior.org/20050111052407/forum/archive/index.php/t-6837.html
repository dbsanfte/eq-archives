If you're a potime geared player with a few guildmates (usually 1 group can cover it), farming things like King Tormax, Ring of Slime, Protect the Gnome, Avatar of War, Kunark Dragons, Zlandicar, etc.  can yield alot of cash loot.  BoT towers with 1 group of potime equipped chars has a chance of dropping ornate chest pieces, Tactics nameds as well.<br />
<br />
Generally speaking, on a patch day, 1-2 groups of potime characters can clear well over a million pp worth of targets with ease.</div></div><hr />

I read a post here that told how to get to Xuzl's tower and how to pull the mobs, but I can't seem to find it now. Does anyone have it bookmarked or can at least let me know how to get the the tower?<br />

When LDoN came out i also made tons of cash farming BoT. When i logged in in the morning, there was nobody in the zone and were basically always 1 - 4 wingbosses + different other nameds. Killing them all took me around one hour and dropped roughly 10 - 250k (You know the amazing droprates in BoT...). However nowadays there are at least 20ppl at any daytime in BoT and more ppl farm them. (/waves Kmorrax + his healer partners on solro :p.)<br />
<br />
Until you are flagged, you also could try FoZ ogers near zonein or down in the bedroom / kitchen areas. They have low HPs, don't hit hard and can drop &quot;a highly polished gem&quot; for the bloodmetal earrings. The downside is, they run (snare whip / maxed finishing blow / root helps) and in the lower areas are many roamers and few save spots.</div></div><hr />

Wait, we all have AE Rampage and our Earthshaker, right?  :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Reason why I like farming sentries / protectors with my wife's cleric is that they don't run, so I  just need to ToD slow them, and I'm gtg.</div></div><hr />

nothing runs.<br />
<br />
anyway if you are geared good enough and you have som form of self-DS, you can just tank everything unslowed for more DPS. me personally I have 36 selfbuffed DS without potion, and the cleric DS adds to that for decent damage output. mephits die fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sindael</div><div class="date">04-26-2004, 12:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">root works for the piggy, just be at max range as aggro from the herd has seemed fairly random, but less likely the farther you are away. just make sure it a nondamage root</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Conanette</div><div class="date">05-05-2004, 06:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">How do you get to the Xuzl area with just a warrior and a cleric?  Extended range pacifying or training the mobs there with cleric DA'd?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">05-05-2004, 09:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">About max range using root has worked for me too always in the past to separate from the herd.  Just root the piggy and let the rest go by, then smack it until you break root and bring to group.  May not be the easiest, but works sufficiently well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Buuhmann</div><div class="date">05-05-2004, 12:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just kill all guardians two at once or use ER + paci carefully on them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">05-05-2004, 02:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The whole route from zone in to any wing only requires about 10 successful pacifications. ER+pacify works about with 75-80% success rate on the sentries &amp; guardians. High level root can take care of those catastrophic resists, or you may prefer to keep gate up on the cleric, and just gate out and run back in the event of aggro. With the 1 hour spawn rate, you should have no trouble running the cleric back in from zone in after gating, and you should be able to reach the wing of your choice in about an hour.</div></div><hr />
