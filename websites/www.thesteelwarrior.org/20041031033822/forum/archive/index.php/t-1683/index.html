<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Orggo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hiya all long time reader first time poster well after bout 2 years of 3 boxing ive decided to off my 55 monk and 55 shammy this should leave me with around 100plus k to spend on my warrior. Upgrades I have considered are SS plate Arm mq other then that im drawing a blank I need a better chest item however with Vindi BP soon on the horizon im not sure I want to dish out 50 plus k for a good bp. Any and all suggestions are appreciated thank you in advance here is the magelo.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Roughbeard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ditch Hammered Golden Hoop, buy Bloodmetal or Mosq or Lizzy, something with comparable hps without that damn neg 15 ac. Somethin with Hps/Sta on the Arms, Neth Scale Vams or somethin like that. (i am lookin for those arms also, very nice stats), Dont know price on your server, but a Black Plated Collar would do good for ya. Upgrade your Weps, get rid of the Tae Ew Longsword, no aggro capabilities there. Darkwood Bow of Suffering would be more hps in your range, as you cap Sta anyways with buff. they only run around 500pp, so sell off your bow for 1-2 k and buy an upgrade. I'd switch to Heiro cloak, sell off your pernic. and buy some illusion: dwarf potions.. :p besides that, you'll be a good tank for a while to come. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Orggo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What should I switch Tae ew for like a snowchipper/newykesha something along those lines Flesh Grinders are few and far between on mah server. Thank you for reply.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Orggo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">ATM in bazaar there is a Sarnak Warhammer 9 20 effect stun in bazaar for 5k Honed Blade of Ykesha 10k snow chipper 5k and Anklesmasher 20k =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tempur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Of the weapons you listed, I would go with the yak.  Snowchipper's proc is a pure DD and as such has very little aggro value.  The yak proc is a DD with stun and likes to proc.  <br />
<br />
Another option which I personally am sick of hearing about but everyone seems to like is the GSoT.  Its good DPS and has an aggro proc to it.  Another benefit is less ripostes when you are fighting in PoP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Orggo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Magelo is now updated for what it's worth. Only saw one black plated collar for sell and guy wanted 250k =/ so dont think ill be getting that anytime soon. Still waiting on some SS plate vambraces to come up for sale no luck yet and im buying a 8th ring mq for 6k for instant clicky.  However after these upgrades im still left with around 50kish. Would it be worthwhile to start buying pieces for my epic ie green and red dragon scales. Or just hold out for that rare piece of nice gear. Any other advice is appreciated.</div></div><hr />
