<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey folks.  Anyone have any links or ideas on the best way to take on this guy?  Its Dozar boss in HoT.  <br />
<br />
We tried last night with only a pickup group and didnt do too well.  Only had 2 clerics and not enough melee.  Anyways is it easier to pull him back or fight him in his room?  Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gallerus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Its probably easiest to pull him up to the hot zone in the 1st few times you kill him - that way you have an ez cr if you wipe.<br />
<br />
His ae is like unresistable 400 pt dd + strips 1 buff, put the clerics around a corner so they dont get hit by ae.  Everyone else should have some type of insta clicker (goblin earring, etc).  Load up the instaclicker + 3-4 junk buffs, but hp buffs + haste on last.<br />
<br />
He is slowable, so have everyone healing your mt till he is debuffed + slowed, after that 1-2 clerics can keep your tank up (can add 1-2 more if mana is an issue).<br />
<br />
Just keep him slowed &amp; beat him down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I read somewhere that casters have to stand ON him in order for a spell to land.  Is that true or is someone trying to have way to much fun?  <br />
<br />
We got the crap buff thing and also the Runes down.  Think after we got our clerics there it, we were on a 4-6 sec CH wheel.  Prob I saw was that most of our melee was not on.  He's got lots of HP's . . .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">unless you have dragons bane, nukers and slowers must stay in melee range to land nukes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Greyslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Sorry about last night Lorre was fun to try to take him again my guild still hasn't beat him.  When we tried him last night we pulled him up the ramp it does seem alot safer than fighting him down in the pit.  Lost because some moron opened the door :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">DoH!  Sorry Grey . . .<br />
<br />
I thought you guys woulda had him easy.  Yeah that door thing is real annoying.  Some invis punk can just run along and open that door to wipe the raid.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I dont think we had such a big problem with staying alive.  Its the DPS that was missing last night.  Most of the rogues were no logged on and we had minimal melee hitting it.  Lot of casters but because you have to stand near him to cast, most of them didnt know. <br />
<br />
Next time I think we will be bringing a lot more DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gallerus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Lost because some moron opened the door  <br />
<br />
Door really has no affect on agro.  You had someone kos move in front of the door most likely (possibly a kos caster that got summoned to within line of sight of the mobs outside the door), or must have practically pushed him into the hub, because the assist ranges on the mobs at the hot door are really small.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>TrendosGnomeWar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Wow my whole guild is here hehe. No idea really how to kill Doz but i do know if u land slow on him first thing he is a wussy, u guys should have had him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gnomb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Btw, Wizard familiars love to open that door as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">stupid flappys ... :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>aspit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">best way is to pin him in his room in one of the corners and just keep the healers outside his room in the enterence pit.  This mob is really easy once you get him slowed and pinned.  Ive actually 3 boxed him with a warrior cleric and shm a few times ^_^ it was close with repop though.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">the door has nothing to do with agro, mobs see straight through it no problem. you can test this by dragging someone elses corpse while standing in front of the closed door. you will die everytime.<br />
<br />
HoT mobs have a very tiny assist, once you agro any mob it yells for help, but HoT mobs dont yell very far. the door mobs will assist the HoT mobs if u push too close to the door, whether its open or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">maybe a history lesson should help here. Doz was 30 man fight 2 expansions ago and since you havent done him and probably have not progressed much past velious and ppl who 1-2 group him have. I'd adjust your numbers or just keep trying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Velle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">well he's even doable by 3ppl. I used farm him with my friends. I 3box(warrior, chanter and rogue) and my friend 2box(cleric and shammy) and other friend nuke (wiz), but wiz didn't have bane spell so didnt help much. U put all casters outside(either left or right side of door) and warrior tank inside. Rogue will just BS from behind. Well since he has alot of HP it took us like 45mins or so. I know a guy who 3box(warrior, cleric and shammy) Doz. Outside casters wont be hit by AE. btw warrior, cleric, rogue and wiz are equipped with elemental gears.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Loosscru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Had a friend ask me about this the other day, this is what I told him-<br />
<br />
And try doze when you get the chance, one group it if you have to. Doze is a mana regen fight. Just a big old endurance contest because of his HP and regen. Maybe 40+ folks can drop him in 3 minutes but otherwise all you need are the essencials. <br />
<br />
Go for it if you can get a 7k+ tank (buffed) and a slower. Add a healer or two and you are set. High MR but the desiease slows stick easily enough. Our first attempt was with 11, two were clerics, fight went over 30 mins and they were both almost oom. We did a fight the other day with 12, 3 clerics, 2 of them were meleeing the entire time because of boredom. 20 or 25 minutes and the main healer was never below 85 mana. <br />
<br />
The difrence was VoQ, 65 bard song, Kitty Crack, Pot 9, AA clarity 2 and FT 3 for the second fight vs, Kei, ft1 and that 4 mana per tick cleric self buff. The extra 30 or 40 mana/tick just turned the encounter into a joke. I think next time we see him up we will go with 4 to see what happens (may be a two hour fight, but eh, why not)<br />
<br />
Keep in mind we are almost done with geering up on HoT.  Lots of 65s with aas, but gear-wise, just where you would expect a HoT group to be.  The shammy just ran up every 4 mins and slowed Doze again, insta clicks are necessary.  This isn't a fast fight with the numbers you have but it is doable.  Good luck to you.</div></div><hr />
