I have also added a few mods to it, such as the inventory, combat skills window, my inventory bags (my favorite mod of all time), player information window, and my map. I just wanted to see what else is out there and what you other warriors are using. So post some screenies of your UI's!<br />
<br />
I'll have mine up when I get home since I'm posting this from work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">01-10-2005, 04:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sars (http://www.sars.has.it) is unofficially the official TSW UI hehe.  It's my favorite anyhow, and the author of it was a warrior that posted here occaisionally.  I'm sure there are others that have different ideas, but I love it, especially the buff bar and the horizontal group window, which is a big help playing a healer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tetzou</div><div class="date">01-10-2005, 04:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I used SARS briefly, very briefly. It was nice, but not nice enough for me to stick to it after I was introduced to SOES by my roommate and fellow warrior.</div></div><hr />

<br />
on this pic, if you notice the bags, you can see the boxes that hold my primary, secondary, ranged, and ammo. It's for quick weapon switching. If i wanted to switch out my epic 1.5 for my shield, i just click my shield, and click it on that secondary box, and it does just that....quick!!!! my favorite mod<br />
<br />
http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v468/yeags777/EverQuest/EQ000108.jpg<br />
<br />
On this one, I opened up on the player window, the Clicks tab...all the clickies you need Plus two XP bars...for regular XP and AA xp.<br />
<br />
http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v468/yeags777/EverQuest/EQ000105.jpg<br />
<br />
This one is without the bag showing so you can see AC and HP and ATK. I keep the bag open for weapon/shield switching<br />

Its near fully customed out, including the 20 slot buff box and 9th spell gem, hah. <br />

It has been jokingly called &quot;mission control&quot; or &quot;holy fuck&quot; a few times.  <br />

If you think its hard on the eyes, wait until you see the old Delta2 ^^<br />

I've adjusted it so that I have chat windows in 3 corners and the main window in the bottom left.  I'm not a fan of having the middle-bottom of my screen blocked by windows in my UI.  I find that its a pain when trying to keep track of short mobs and the targetting ring in a crowd.<br />
<br />
Shrunk down and a little older version of the UI, but you get the idea... <br />

It's the win when it comes to quick weapon changing. You can get it here<br />

Bag Mod (http://www.eqinterface.com/downloads/fileinfo.php?id=2851) <br />
<br />
Only problem is that when you go to remove/insert augs, you have to load default.  That's not a big deal to me. Takes like 20 seconds to /loadskin default, remove/insert, /loadskin soes.  <br />
<br />
Check it out!</div></div><hr />

It was quite nice, all the windows fit together well, had two chat boxed and didn't cover half your screen like a lot of the other custom UIs. I wound up tossing on a mini-invintory, TKing spellbook and clear &quot;my attacks&quot;/&quot;me getting hit&quot; boxes in the top left/right of the screen, it worked pretty mint. Everyone that I told about it liked it, but UI's might be a lot more fancy now since I stopped playing.<br />
<br />
You can see a pic here (http://www.eqinterface.com/downloads/preview.php?id=4364) courtesy of EQinterface, it seems they have two chat boxes where there is usually only one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I see that you're uploading .bmp. You should go into your eqclient.ini file, make  a new line (I just put my cursor at the beginning of an existing line and hit enter, creating the new line) and add this in that new line....<br />
<br />
ScreenshotType=jpg<br />
<br />
That way, everytime you take a SS, it's automatically saved as a jpeg. Try that and then upload to photobucket again. I also use photobucket, never had a problem if I uploaded jpeg's.</div></div><hr />

First go to www.eqinterface.com (http://www.eqinterface.com) and register if you haven't already. Just log in, and you can start hittin these links. Follow the instructions for each of them. You will end up creating a SOES folder in your Sony&gt;Everquest&gt;uifiles directory. All of this will end up in that folder.<br />

what i like about my UI is that the entire inventory is on the screen (ive yet to see another UI like this).  Also i like the vertical buff window better than the horizontal so when you hit alt to see the minutes left you dont get a clusterfuck. my buff box has the seconds hanging off the right side of the screen so when i hit alt i only see the minutes. oh yeah next time i will not show up for Ture without my jboots  :eek: i was also thinking of making room for the action window (alt M i think) into my ui.  the window in the upper left is just spam. the window above my chat window is taunt, procs, target too far away, and other battle spam shit.  oh yeah i tanked warden when we killed him today too  :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tohkin</div><div class="date">01-13-2005, 04:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My current UI... Drakah UI, I seem to like it quite a bit and works pretty well for me, although that SARs is looking pretty hot.<br />
<br />
Anyways Upper left corner is TSW channel with small box for non-melee hits about it. There is a box in the middle for friends channel (fucking empty these days), and on the right is crits box for all types of crits. Lower left corner is melee only numbers, big box next to it is all the spell information as well as ooc, shout, auction, al that other spammy stuff. Lower right is guild, group, say, and raidchat. That attack mode box flases red when auto attack is on! Hua!<br />
<br />
Oh yeah I know I said it was for Detheb.. I was confused it's Tetzou's thread~<br />
<br />
http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v240/Crusha015/EQ000082.jpg<br />
<br />
P.S. those invisible boxes are bigger then they show, they all go down a bit more.<br />
<br />
Ok and now that I typed this all up I can't upload on this site cuz it's too big! So you'll get to see it once I find a place to host.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fooba</div><div class="date">01-13-2005, 04:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">no inventory on yours &gt;&lt;...also i like how the red flashing attack box goes around the target on mine...instead of the attack mode thinggy on yours.  On mine the player info was put into the group window, the player window was turned into the target window (hence the red flashing box), and the target window was turned into the inventory...on yours apparently they took out the inventory for the attack mode window  :(</div></div><hr />

K, lets hope this works~<br />
Just went into MSpaint and resaved the file as Jpg~<br />
<br />
Its pretty easy to figure out. I have everything filtered Except for my melee and my spells, and my bard songs, my buff, etc. Group,Guild,Raid,Channels(Including TSW) go into The Main chat, and spells, and critical hits go into the smaller box. Its a very organized UI.<br />
<br />
Also, yes, that is a 2% buffer into 70.. go slackers~</div></div><hr />

Hey bro...go to our guildpage Triton (http://www.tritonguild.net)  and scroll down the bottom of the newest update and you'll see a SS of guildmanagement tool showing one of our druids that had deleveled to 69 (I took the SS) while doing the Ragefire 2.0 cleric epic.

It is possible to make new chat windows to filter that crapola out of there. It is a lot, but I set my colors so that I can actually tell what's going on. If I crit, it's bright green, rampage/enraged = red, taunt/disarm = orange, etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
Tetzou, the small window between your melee window and your player info, on top of your hot keys, what file does that come from? I can't seem to find it using any of the links you gave on page 2 <br />
<br />
I believe you're talking about where I have all my attributes and resists? That is actually the PET window. So you can either do ALT P or go up to that Window Selector (mine is up top, just under the MP3 plater. I made the faded level to 0 so that when im not using it, it's invisible) and click on the Pet window button to open it.</div></div><hr />
