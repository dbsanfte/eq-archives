<br />
I've been pondering which augment to add to my Royal Attendant Sleeves of the Sand in the type 3 slot and was curious what my fellow warriors thought.  The 3 main choices I forsee are:<br />
<br />
Dodge +8% (Miragul)<br />
Vengence III-IV (varied)<br />
10AC (MMC)<br />
<br />
Now, my main question would be the difference/benefit garnered from the 10AC augment and the Dodge augment.  I currently run around 1415 AC normally buffed, and my ATK varies from group to group from 1600-1800 depending on the make-up.  I'm usually the MT for my group/raid, so I'm more concerned in general about taking damage than dishing it out.  So, I was curious what my fellow Overlord/Warlords opinions were on these choices and if they had any input to a selection.<br />
<br />
I appreciate the input, thanks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tappy</div><div class="date">11-03-2003, 06:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There were some studies over at the Paladins of Norrath site (including lots of parses) showing that the +dodge modifications on items were very close to useless.  This was before LDoN, with some of the POP era items that had +dodge mods, but I am confident that the augments would have very little effect.<br />
<br />
Go with something else.<br />
<br />
:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">11-03-2003, 07:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well if you look at what an 8% dodge mod does here is what you get<br />
<br />
Warrior dodge cap: 175<br />
Warrior cap with 8% mod: 189<br />
<br />
Paladin dodge cap: 155<br />
Paladin cap with 8% mod: 167<br />
<br />
So dodge mod does give you 14 more points of dodge skill, and it gives paladins 13 more points.  Admittedly this difference would be very hard to parse but I think that is due to the fact that dodges are so rare, rather than the fact that it does nothing.  Then again every little bit does help.  Once you have maxed out all the tanking aa's there are limited things that you can use to increase your tanking.<br />
<br />
I think that it would be hard to parse the difference that 10-20 attack makes in your dps, but that doesn't mean that vengence is useless either.  Again every bit helps.</div></div><hr />

I've looked at many parses done on Dodge % Mods and Riposte % Mods and parry % Mods and they have turned up with barely any change.(They barely happen much to begin with)  You'd get more bang-for-the-buck by going for the Veng and getting extra dps for aggro. AC never hurts either ;)<br />
<br />
Rough</div></div><hr />

The one that you can buy in MM only fits in face, waist, back, shoulders and neck slots. So the choice is really between dodge and vengence.</div></div><hr />

Warrior dodge cap: 175 <br />
<br />
U sure its 175? in my skill windows it sais 190 :D <br />
<br />
Go for the dodge augment. I have it on my BP and i have noticed a significative increase on hits avoidance. If cap is 190 its 15 points more. Maybe theres a bonus over 200 or whatever but that dodge aug does his work pretty well for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flair</div><div class="date">11-04-2003, 12:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Someone had posted on the Overlord part of this forum that they had added the +8pct dodge and seen signifcant (subjective) differences.  A set of parses seems to be in order ;-)<br />
<br />
There is a +5ac mod for shoulders:<br />
<br />
Jagged Marble Sphere of Protection<br />
Notlore, AC:5 ; Face, Neck, Shoulder, Back, Waist<br />
<br />
Not uber but worth factoring</div></div><hr />
