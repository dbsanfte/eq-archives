I just wanted to thank everyone on the input I got from my last post. I have leveled and got some better gear. I have been using the Fabled exe axe (for 2 Handed) and have had good luck holding agro in LDONs. I am looking for more feedback from the group to say what I need to focus on next in the way of upgrades. I just got in a guild and hopfully will begin going to some fun places like UP and maybe ssra if I am lucky. I also like having out of the ordinary weapons so anything odd that drops will always be preferred over what everyone else is carrying. I don't want to be the top tank just one who can stand his ground and have a little fun. Thanks a lot guys and gals.<br />
