The inability to find anything up on most days is disheartening. Even when we find something up, it just doesnt fill the evening hours sufficiently. That second target just never manifests. Juggling time instances across 3 and now 4 guilds is no picnic especially with the recent slew of bugs.<br />
<br />
G'dam we even talked about going back and rejoining the Vt rotation just for the hell of having something we can add to the mix. <br />
<br />
Some enterprising people have even started a twinks only guild for those nights that there is nothing to do. O the horror ! Can you say Bezerker twinks galore QQ.<br />
<br />
Will Discord actually offer sufficent content to mitigate this mire?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hyardgune</div><div class="date">01-29-2004, 09:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sucks for you.  Sucks even more for lower tier guilds who get to sit idle because mini-raids of bored Time-geared have cleared all of our targets so they could sell/twink alts.  Let me tell you, it is great to log on to &quot;Well, we'd do AoW tonight except for the fact that the spawn got blown by Time_guild03 who wiped while farming him.&quot;<br />
<br />
Here's your answer, Discord won't do squat to mitigate this either.  All it will do is give lower guilds a brief respite while the ubers fight over Time and GoD before getting bored and coming to wipe out our targets with even fewer people than before.  Personally, I'm hoping that GoD will be a huge timesink that keeps the ubers occupied 24/7 for months.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unless of course the loot has been so far outclassed by then it's not worth the effort.<br />
<br />
And that's most likely going to happen to a good solid portion of Luclin with Gates of Discord.  Not much Velious content is fought over by the ubers these days. And even on off-days, it takes some doing to get people to go after Velious content, on Povar anyways.</div></div><hr />

<br />
3 guilds in time (2 US, 1 Euro)<br />
3 guilds in EP (2 US, 1 Euro)<br />
1 Guild up to Sol Ro/RZ (US)<br />
2 or 3 guilds on lower pop (All US (I think))<br />
2 or 3 guilds on upper Luclin..Ssra/VT (1 US, 1 Aussie, 1 Asian)<br />
<br />
So it's fairly spread out, normally 2 or 3 things a night worth killing for all...<br />
<br />
Good to be a Euro there anyway :)</div></div><hr />
