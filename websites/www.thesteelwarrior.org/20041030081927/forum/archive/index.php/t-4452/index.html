<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've read a few posts where warriors bought certain LDoN items or items from the bazaar.<br />
<br />
I'd like to opine that with the melee changes that are looming, it may be wiser to not spend LDoN points but instead wait and see what happens.<br />
<br />
For example, the club in Miraguls... same cost as the dirk, but the dirk looks better to me.  The only downside is the lame skill level limitation warriors have for piercing weapons.  If the skill level is raised, the Dirk will rock. <br />
<br />
I give it a 75% chance this cap will be raised to 250 after the melee realignment.   In fact, I encourage you all to /feedback this.  I wonder, how many weapons are there, that we can use, that rogues would want to use?<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'm hanging on to my plat and my points for a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">That dirk is costing you but 1.5% DPS with an equal ratio slasher/crusher atm. No biggie eh?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">well no one wants to lose DPS.  But as it has been said here before, our DPS is low enough that it doesn't much matter.  The Dirk does have some STA on it, and, assumnig our stats aren't always maxed, it could come in handy. Besides, it looks better than club.<br />
<br />
But after the melee adjustment things could be different.</div></div><hr />
