<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yerba</div><div class="date">05-25-2004, 05:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ive been searching through the Arena and Library for functional and statistical comparisons of the defensive discs and found no comparison data on Stonewall.<br />
<br />
Ive read through the long discussion and observation threads detailing how EQ melee systems work and whether Defensive or Evasive work better on certain types of mobs etc. However when trying to decide between these two or Stonewall it seems my only factor is Stonewall's snare component.<br />
<br />
From the Library i retrieved links to get these Lucy Raw Spell Data Sets:<br />
<br />
Evasive<br />
<br />
Description <br />
1:  Increase Chance to Avoid Melee by 50% <br />
2:  Decrease Chance to Hit by 33% <br />
<br />
<br />
Defensive<br />
<br />
Description <br />
1:  Increase Melee Mitigation by 45% <br />
2:  Decrease Damage Modifier by 55% <br />
3:  Chance to Critical Hit(0) <br />
<br />
<br />
Stonewall<br />
<br />
Description <br />
1:  Increase Melee Mitigation by 45% <br />
3:  Chance to Critical Hit(0) <br />
12:  Decrease Movement by 70% <br />
<br />
<br />
How does the Melee Mitigation increase from Stonewall compare to Defensive?<br />
<br />
Obviously the chance to avoid in Evasive would be better suited to Mobs with high damage bonuses or procs / flurries etc. But if Defensive is halving the damage interval with a damage modifier decrease AND increasing melee mitigation, what would be the benefit of Stonewall other than the increased DPS?</div></div><hr />

In a related question, it seems to be generally agreed that agro generated by DPS is calculated by potential damage, so a hit or miss doesn't matter nearly as much as a swing. However, has anyone confirmed if you gain more agro from stonewall over defensive since your dps is not being decreased? I am ignoring Evasive in this question since agro is generated by potential damage so misses don't have much of an effect on agro. <br />

<br />
The damage mitigation between Defensive and Stonewall is the same. You will take the same damage from either of them. The only tradeoff between them is with defensive you do less damage, with stonewall you get snared. I have started using Stonewall a lot more in groups to keep dps up, and it works fine as long as the group is not tashing/slowing/etc from a long way away.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bigchest</div><div class="date">05-25-2004, 06:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ah very good point pag0, it seems that with defensive if your max damage is lower that your aggro would be as well, evasive doesnt have this problem so i might use that more often</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">05-25-2004, 06:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It has been my impression that there is no loss of aggro when defensive.  Being defensive is not very different from fighting a high-mitigation Luclin mob.  I've never heard anyone suggest that we get less aggro when fighting high-mitigation Luclin mobs.  The theory is that you gain a fixed amount of aggro per swing, based on the weapon's bonus and damage rating, regardless of how much damage each swing actually does.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Defensive I only use if i think my movement is that  critical to the encounter.<br />
<br />
Stonewall is my still my primary disc though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ealsur Helevorn</div><div class="date">05-26-2004, 12:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use Stonewall on LDoNs and xp groups mostly. Defensive (or Evasive) is still better for MTing, since I really dont care for my DPS, but I rather move the mob accordingly and be able to position it in case that there is heavy meele push or anything happens.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">05-26-2004, 01:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Primal Arachnid drops your attak by 1000 which lowers it to the lowest value it can possibly be (around 600, can't lower attack below what offense and weapon skills give you) and you pretty much hit min every hit guaranteed and there's no noticeable difference in getting aggro.<br />
<br />
Stonewall is okay if you're cornering or fighting a perma rooted mob on a raid.  More DPS is still more DPS.  Against stuff that is likely to move (and not due to stupidity like 10 X swarm pets or whatever), defensive or evasive would be better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cuclain MacLlir</div><div class="date">05-26-2004, 02:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">To actually answer the posters question: the &quot;damage modifier&quot; decrease is your damage, not the mobs. The defensive effects of stonewall and defensive are identical; the trade-off is between DPS and movement.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varalla</div><div class="date">05-26-2004, 07:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use stonewall to maintain my DPS. <br />
(I ususaly play a big percentage of groups or raids DPS)<br />
<br />
I use defensive and evasive as situational discs.</div></div><hr />

I couldnt have said it better myself</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Romul</div><div class="date">05-30-2004, 10:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The purpose of Stonewall is situational, I personally do alot of cleric/war duo, and that means if I went defensive for any reason, its nearly half my dps gone so I go stonewall.  Using a BoW, DPS has a noticeable part in the aggro building, and when I use defensive on raid mobs, or sometimes even stonewalls, I see very little difference in aggro, the occasional over dotting necro or wizard are about all that gets summoned.  If I was to lose half my DPS with my BoW if actual DPS dictated aggro, i'd notice a tremendous aggro loss, which I don't.  So going off whats assumed as correct in DPS aggro being from potential damage vice actual damage, defensive is a much better choice in a raid or situation where you need to move.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ogbasher</div><div class="date">06-04-2004, 12:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I hardly ever use stonewall in a raid situation.  Nothing like being snared when you need to get somewhere and you watch a ping ponging mob wipe your raid.  I use it in XP groups when i dont want the drop in DPS.  when on a raid, who cares imo.</div></div><hr />
