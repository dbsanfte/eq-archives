<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casual Guy</div><div class="date">05-12-2003, 03:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In reading some posts here, it seems the general consensus is that increasing DEX will cause weapon skills to go up faster.  I thought INT was used for all skill ups.  In fact, when I started giving my Ogre warroir KEI, his 1HS went from 2 levels behind (10 points) to all caught up (15 points of increase during that level).  I didn't change DEX at all.  Has there been any good data collected on this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">05-12-2003, 04:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dex definitely helps with melee skill ups.  Had my dex buffed to 240 yesterday and skilled up like mad on 2h blunt. (everything else is maxed, 2h blunt was 50 when I started). Got about 15 skillups in the brief period before my scarecrow illusion faded.  High int will help with pretty much any skill I would guess, it may work like trades, where there are several attributes that can affect your skill up rate, and whichever is the highest is what it checks against.<br />
<br />
Beo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casual Guy</div><div class="date">05-12-2003, 05:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I saw a fletching thread in this forum where people talked about both INT and DEX as skill up stats and WIS as a success rate stat.  As far as trade skills go, the INT and WIS thing is well known, but the only place I've seen people mention DEX is here in this forum.  Maybe whatever your class uses for primary stats (the green ones at character creation) are the ones checked.  <br />
<br />
I'm looking for confimation though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spliskin</div><div class="date">05-12-2003, 10:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First as for tradeskills, wisdom does not effect your success rate.  Check out eqtraders.com for a run down of what stats do for tradeskills.  If wisdom did effect success rates, it would be a clear advantage for wisdom casters to do tradeskills.<br />
<br />
Dex is the stat that controls the rate of weapon skill ups and has been confirmed by Sony/Verant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fvighlander</div><div class="date">05-13-2003, 08:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dex affects offensive melee skill-up rate. May be defensive as well, although I seem to remember the same info release from Sony stating that agility was the stat that helps skill up in defense, dodge, etc...<br />
<br />
Wis and Int are used in tradeskills and other non-combat skill-up calculations. Whichever is higher determines how much of a chance you have to gain skill points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Blacktalun</div><div class="date">05-13-2003, 10:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can tell you as a Halfling warrior with very high Dex/AGI that all of my skills are maxed before I even get 1 blue of exp in.  It's is funny because often on the first critter after a ding whatever Weapon I am using is maxed already.  Pre 60 I would always make sure I had one of each type of weapon (other than 2hb) with me whenever I was close to a new level.  Defense typically took a little longer , but still only a few critters if I was tanking.<br />
<br />
Typically a few minutes after a new level are filled with skilling spam between weapon/dodge/riposte and defense.  My Wis/Int are extremely low btw.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">weoden</div><div class="date">05-13-2003, 01:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is my understanding that dex increases weapons skills and agi increases defense skills.  That is why the dex buffs that shaman can give are so very nice.  Also, wis does influnce success or failure when trade skilling.  My Halfling/druid has 200ish wis and if I have on my cha gear and do not change back to the wis gear then I will see 5% more failures on trival combines.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Macnair</div><div class="date">05-13-2003, 08:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One thing to also consider is haste.<br />
<br />
Nothing will get your skills up faster then haveing the max haste on you.   More swings =  more chances for an improve.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kellaen</div><div class="date">05-13-2003, 11:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Str = Offense <br />
Agi = Defense<br />
Dex = Weapon skills<br />
<br />
Int / Wis only determine chance to skill up with tradeskills. The only thing that affects success rates is skill level vs item trivial. Contrary to popular belief just because something says trivial doesn't mean it's a flat 5% chance of failure, items far below your current skill only seem to follow the 5% rule stated oh so long ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kokonut Pye</div><div class="date">05-13-2003, 11:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe the manual that came with the game said that strength and dexterity affect offensive skill ups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casual Guy</div><div class="date">05-25-2003, 05:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kellaen - That would make sense.  My STR has always been over 200 (Ogre with full crusty) and my offence goes up very well.  My DEX has always been under 75, and I struggle to keep the three one hand skills maxed (1HS, 1HB, Pierce) at each level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lillyann</div><div class="date">05-26-2003, 06:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bah, I think skills up happens when they want to.<br />
<br />
From all the characters i Have played I noticed I always get skill ups at the beginning of a level, and then near the end, with the rare skill up in between.<br />
<br />
There is some sort of formula in there that is making skill ups a time sink no matter what gear you have on. <br />
