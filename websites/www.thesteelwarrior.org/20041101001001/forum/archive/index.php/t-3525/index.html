On test, Anger 3 now is doubled to 600 hate. In fact Anger 1 and 2 were both doubled as well.<br />
<br />
Lets see, dual EB items with an Anger 3 augment on each= drool. Hell, two dps weapons with Anger 3 is sweet.</div></div><hr />

Warrior_03 tells guild, 'tank looking for real xp group'<br />
<br />
i still dont understand why he so dislike LDoN. well, he never said he &quot;dislike&quot; LDoN, but from what he says in guildchat, i wont be suprised that even i send a tell ask him try LDoN, he will say &quot;no thanks, i would rather go earn some real xp than playing in lowbie zones&quot; ;)</div></div><hr />

They arent tagged lore, but you cannot have more than 1 of each kind, so yes basically they are lore, you still can have anger III on one weapon and anger II on another.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gerald</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">The definition of lore is not being able to have 2 of one thing... ie 2 anger 3 procs :p.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If they don't have a &quot;LORE ITEM&quot; flag on them, then you can have 2 of them, as long as they are bound to seperate items.  <br />
<br />
The screenshot here http://www.phantomraiders.org/members/  (go to Miraguls link at top, scroll down to 1150pt area) shows it not to be a lore item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>KhalimBloodhelm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I could be wrong, but augments are only lore if they aren't attatched to anything.  So even if these were lore, it wouldn't mean you can't have them on weapons.  Once they are augmented, it doesn't matter if you have one on each weapon.  But you might not be able to have 2 actual augment gems on you at the same time.  Maybe . . .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Also from the patch message...<br />
<br />
- Corrected a bug that allowed players to buy multiple lore augmentations if they were in a bag (which also caused issues when trying to loot corpses with those items). If you had multiple lore items, the extra items will be removed. A refund for the points spent on those items will be made when they are deleted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Solinar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Anger 3 augments were not lore.  I had anger 3 on both my BF and my BoC and had no problems with using them, looting them, equipping them, etc.</div></div><hr />

Don't get me wrong I'm estatic thouigh...this is great news.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Snowz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Without logging on and checking, I'm pretty confident Anger augments are indeed Warrior only.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Myst Darkwind</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">They are warrior only.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">damn i'm even happier then ;-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">It's not live, the effect went to the live spell file after the patch. The changes won't go to live servers until there is a patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Mondion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">As of right now, there is no more 1h restrictions on Anger2.  Anger 3 may be a different story.. I haven't the points in EF to check.  I just got a sews last night, this is gonna be sweet if its not a mistake.</div></div><hr />

Speaking from the experience of having a level 64 druid bot, when the spell has changes on the LIVE database in Lucy, that effect is indeed in the game.  <br />
<br />
Since we are talking about a change to a &quot;spell&quot; that already existed, I am 99% confident that those of you with Anger 3 procs are getting 600 points of hate.  <br />
<br />
If we had been talking about a new spell, we would need to wait for it to show up on an item.<br />
<br />
That, and what would you call the 5 hours of downtime this morning besides a patch?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Gerald</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">It would arguably be more overpowering to have anger3 1hander only since you could have multiple anger procs. They really need to turn on the light bulbs in their heads and remember that while many people would put them on their Blades of War, the majority of EQ players don't have access to said weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Frax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">The anger III aug someone linked me tonight was Type 8   :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">When a new spell has been brought live, it may not actually be available.<br />
<br />
When a spell is improved or somehow change, as the Anger III one is, then it's merely updating what's already there.  So yes, as of this patch Anger III should do 600 hate.<br />
<br />
Is Anger III now Type 8? (Type 8 is PoTime-level equipment, right?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Anger III is still type 4</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Cily</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">They added new Type 8 proc copies of all the high end procing augs from what I can tell.<br />
<br />
There is a new 125+stun yak aug at Guk that is type 8, and new high end lifetap aug that is type 8, I assume this is prolly true for anger 3 as well.<br />
<br />
So, still have the high end procs available for type 4, its just time level folk can have 2 of each now.<br />
<br />
Cily</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>ODB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">You all realize that by getting excited about this change and getting these augments only shows SOE that we are still willing to go with the Proc'd Hate that we have been dependent on since Velious, which will, in turn, make them think we are satisfied with it, giving them all the less reason to fix our aggro issues at the core.<br />
<br />
Boycott the augments!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Boycott the augments!<br />
<br />
What do we use for agro ? Procs<br />
Whats our problem ? Need more agro<br />
Easy way out ? More Procs.<br />
<br />
You can not deny the fact that a &quot;Second Bandaid&quot; (see EB2.0) is much better than :<br />
- There is no class balance issue<br />
- Classes are not that out of balance<br />
- We are looking at the class balance issue<br />
<br />
They took the easy way out, but shit, at least we got something !<br />
<br />
 we have been dependent on since Velious<br />
<br />
Just like rogues are stuck with BS, we are stuck with EB.<br />
<br />
Instead of trying to get rid of it (An idea which doesnt seem attractive to SoE)<br />
Lets try to work with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Gryzx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">All I realize is that we are actually getting an improvement, that's way more than I ever thought would happen.  No this doesn't 100% fix the problem but it sure is nice to see they are doing something at all.  This brings near EB quality aggro to the casual gamer, but yes even the EB warriors still had problems with snap aggro.  But who knows maybe they're still thinking about doing something to fix that also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Findra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">I agree that this is nothing more than expanding the proc/hate bandaid - but if it is truely WAR only, at least it is a step in the right direction.<br />
<br />
Also realize that SoE has stated (to the effect of) they think Taunt is broken, and needs to be fixed.<br />
<br />
Procs allow warriors to maintain aggro, assuming some Pally/SK isn't chain casting aggro spells.<br />
<br />
However, early in any fight we are still dependant on either:<br />
<br />
1.  A lucky proc<br />
2.  A sucessful taunt over someone elses' aggro (typically a tash/malo/slow)<br />
<br />
This is the core of what needs to be fixed.  That and the damned 100hp 100mana itemization crap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Myst Darkwind</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">I have an Anger III proc on a BOC currently. Unfortunately I was not able to get BF and my guild has moved past Ssra content.<br />
<br />
The proc is warrior only. And it procs at a very nice rate. <br />
<br />
From parses and test in missions and POEB last night I was able to trash tank and keep aggro from Warriors with BOW. (No they did not taunt. )<br />
<br />
And I took aggro from the SK in my group in LDON. Not &quot;snap&quot; but enough that it seems to have helped.<br />
<br />
Is it a long term fix? No. but it helps</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">No whining about warrior improvments!  God Damn I'm tired of moving threads with legitimate topics to the outhouse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Zolanoid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">OK, 600 Hate is great...<br />
... but does anybody know for sure if the Anger augs are still Restricted to 1 hander only still? Otherwise, Yak is still the way to go for 2 hander aggro, it seems. I heard a rumor that Anger may work on 2 handers now... would confirm/deny this myself but I don't have dick for points in Miragul's.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Myst Darkwind</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">There is no restriction on the Anger Augments now. <br />
<br />
I have not put it on a 2 hander but it no longer shows the restriction on the augment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>moglar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Sshaithis, I hate LDON too.  Why?  Several bad experiences plus the fact I hate playing with strangers in pickup groups.  It's relatively easy for me to start making a grind group in a spot with a couple few people, and wait for more friends to log on; whereas, with LDON, whomever is available for that 90 minute session is who I' mstuck with for 90 minutes.  When I'm done, whatever friends have logged on since I began the adventure have found groups / adventures of their own, so I'm stuck in the same cycle over again, playing with F*cking morons who don't know how to listen to instructions.</div></div><hr />
