Also, at least from a warrior standpoint, the AV rewards seem much better. Although I've never looked at it from a caster standpoint....<br />
<br />
I won't argue with you.  I had high hopes for Alterac Valley being the be all/end all of PvP, but sadly, it didn't turn out that way.  The high number of epic geared alliance gimps (yes, they're fucking gimps, couldn't PvP their way out of a paper bag if they didn't have 2k more HP than me) makes it virtually insurmountable on my server.  MC horde guilds spend most of their time doing PvE, and rarely PvP, so it's just a waste of effort to even zone in.  20 MC geared people + 10 random idiot pallies spamming Consecration and DA every time they refresh is a complete brick wall to ever overcome that with pickup idiots.<br />
<br />
At least in Gulch, I can contribute, and oh boy, do I fucking contribute.  I contribute by whooping the ass of everyone I find, and because it's smaller numbers, I can generally get the job done solo.  Put a healer behind me and there's a huge swathe of bodies behind me.  Gulch isn't perfect, nor is the advancement acceptable in my eyes, but it's definitely more fun than AV was.</div></div><hr />

Mithras!  I'll be looking for you my friend!   :D <br />
<br />
Been grouping a small bit with Clan Meteoris this past weekend, hoping to get in more with them as they are one of the only coordinated group of folks I've found from the Alliance in WSG.  Looking forward to being snared, blasted, bashed, all that good stuff from you soon.  However, be aware...I will get my kills in here &amp; there!   ;)<br />
<br />
Oh, and justify my claim would ya...on Blackhand, Alliance are pushovers for the most part.  Am I right or am I right???   :) <br />
<br />
/em apologies for his abuse of the smilies, in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Unicron</div><div class="date">07-25-2005, 10:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Guess it depends on the server, but on Deathwing the last patch really brought AV to where I thought it could be.   I still think a 20v20 BG would be best, a middleground between AV and WSG, but right now, AV is a blast.  The guards are just a nuisance to be dealt with, instead of an insurmountable force.  You don't HAVE to use the NPC helpers (reavers, Lok, etc), but they do help if you're stuck.<br />
<br />
Maybe we just have really strong horde on my server, but I'm having a blast there.  Faction is working great, alliance puts up a decent fight (sometimes) and everything seems to be working as intended, and it's fantastic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telen</div><div class="date">07-26-2005, 02:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm finally having a blast in AV also.  Once you get the hang of how everything works it is a lot more fun.  I am about 25% through revered and I still don't understand exactly how everything works.  Is there a good guide somewhere?<br />
<br />
The only thing that I don't like is that horde on my server give up too easily, and alliance seems to win more than horde.  Alliance also never give up, even when we're in their base kicking the crap out of them there are 40 in the instance.  Horde leave and there's 20 of us left and everyone who comes in just leaves.  Alliance oftentimes really coordinate the top guilds together, and sometimes it's two or three coordinated alliance guilds against a bunch of unorganized horde.  I try to provide some leadership, but you just can't compete with top notch organized guilds with 40 random players.  On the other side, horde occasionally have top guilds organized in AV, but horde is much more fragmented.<br />
<br />
I went through about ten losses this weekend before finally getting a win, but I've been on three wins in a row now, so it's getting better.  Usually if it's 40 random alliance vs 40 random horde it turns into a very long drawn out battle, but it seems like horde win in those cases.  Healing makes the hugest difference...  I can go through some AV's with zero healing, lose hardcore, and have like 10 killing blows.  But if I'm getting healing it seems like we win more often and I can leave with 25-50 killing blows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Unicron</div><div class="date">07-26-2005, 10:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">AV is infinetly more fun with a healer attached to you.  We can really tear up with our area attacks if we have a priest or druid following us around.  Have to time the heals right because warriors are prime targets for focus fire.<br />
<br />
Even just one or two heals can mean the different in no kills and three or four kills in 15 seconds or so.  Piercing howl + Whirlwind (and a warstomp for us cows).</div></div><hr />
