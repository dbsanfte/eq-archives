<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">12-13-2003, 12:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I never dreamed slowly cruising through a residential neighborhood <br />
could be so incredibly dangerous! <br />
<br />
Studies have shown that motorcycling requires more decisions per <br />
second, and more sheer data processing than nearly any other common <br />
activity or sport. The reactions and accurate decision making abilities <br />
needed have been likened to the reactions of fighter pilots! The <br />
consequences of bad decisions or poor situational awareness are pretty <br />
much the same for both groups too. <br />
<br />
Occasionally, as a rider I have caught myself starting to make bad or <br />
late decisions while riding. In flight training, my instructors called <br />
this being &quot;behind the power curve&quot;. It is a mark of experience that <br />
when this begins to happen, the rider recognizes the situation, and <br />
more importantly, does something about it. A short break, a meal, or <br />
even a gas stop can set things right again as it gives the brain a <br />
chance to catch up. <br />
<br />
Good, accurate, and timely decisions are essential when riding a <br />
motorcycle... at least if you want to remain among the living. In <br />
short, the brain needs to keep up with the machine. <br />
<br />
I had been banging around the roads of east Texas and as I headed back <br />
into Dallas, found myself in very heavy, high-speed traffic on the <br />
freeways. Normally, this is not a problem, I commute in these <br />
conditions daily, but suddenly I was nearly run down by a cage that <br />
decided it needed my lane more than I did. This is not normally a big <br />
deal either, as it happens around here often, but usually I can <br />
accurately predict which drivers are not paying attention and avoid <br />
them before we are even close. This one I missed seeing until it was <br />
nearly too late, and as I took evasive action I nearly broadsided <br />
another car that I was not even aware was there! <br />
<br />
Two bad decisions and insufficient situational awareness... all within <br />
seconds. I was behind the power curve. Time to get off the freeway. <br />
<br />
I hit the next exit, and as I was in an area I knew pretty well, headed <br />
through a few big residential neighborhoods as a new route home. As I <br />
turned onto the nearly empty streets I opened the visor on my full-face <br />
helmet to help get some air. I figured some slow riding through the <br />
quiet surface streets would give me time to relax, think, and regain <br />
that &quot;edge&quot;so frequently required when riding. <br />
<br />
Little did I suspect... <br />
<br />
As I passed an oncoming car, a brown furry missile shot out from under <br />
it and tumbled to a stop immediately in front of me. It was a squirrel, <br />
and must have been trying to run across the road when it encountered <br />
the car. I really was not going very fast, but there was no time to <br />
brake or avoid it - it was that close. <br />
<br />
I hate to run over animals... and I really hate it on a motorcycle, but <br />
a squirrel should pose no danger to me. I barely had time to brace for <br />
the impact. <br />
<br />
Animal lovers, never fear. Squirrels can take care of themselves! <br />
<br />
Inches before impact, the squirrel flipped to his feet. He was standing <br />
on his hind legs and facing the oncoming Valkyrie with steadfast <br />
resolve in his little beady eyes. His mouth opened, and at the last <br />
possible second, he screamed and leapt! I am pretty sure the scream was <br />
squirrel for, &quot;Banzai!&quot; or maybe, &quot;Die you gravy-sucking, heathen <br />
scum!&quot; as the leap was spectacular and he flew over the windshield and <br />
impacted me squarely in the chest. <br />
<br />
Instantly he set upon me. If I did not know better I would have sworn <br />
he brought twenty of his little buddies along for the attack. Snarling, <br />
hissing, and tearing at my clothes, he was a frenzy of activity. As I <br />
was dressed only in a light t-shirt, summer riding gloves, and jeans <br />
this was a bit of a cause for concern. This furry little tornado was <br />
doing some damage! <br />
<br />
Picture a large man on a huge black and chrome cruiser, dressed in <br />
jeans, a t-shirt, and leather gloves puttering maybe 25mph down a quiet <br />
residential street... and in the fight of his life with a squirrel. And <br />
losing. <br />
<br />
I grabbed for him with my left hand and managed to snag his tail. With <br />
all my strength I flung the evil rodent off the left of the bike, <br />
almost running into the right curb as I recoiled from the throw. <br />
<br />
That should have done it. The matter should have ended right there. It <br />
really should have. The squirrel could have sailed into one of the <br />
pristinely kept yards and gone on about his business, and I could have <br />
headed home. No one would have been the wiser. <br />
<br />
But this was no ordinary squirrel. This was not even an ordinary <br />
pissed-off squirrel. <br />
<br />
This was an evil attack squirrel of death! <br />
<br />
Somehow he caught my gloved finger with one of his little hands, and <br />
with the force of the throw swung around and with a resounding thump <br />
and an amazing impact he landed square on my back and resumed his <br />
rather anti-social and extremely distracting activities. He also <br />
managed to take my left glove with him! <br />
<br />
The situation was not improved. Not improved at all. His attacks were <br />
continuing, and now I could not reach him. <br />
<br />
I was startled to say the least. The combination of the force of the <br />
throw, only having one hand (the throttle hand) on the handlebars, and <br />
my jerking back unfortunately put a healthy twist through my right hand <br />
and into the throttle. A healthy twist on the throttle of a Valkyrie <br />
can only have one result. Torque. This is what the Valkyrie is made <br />
for, and she is very, very good at it. <br />
<br />
The engine roared as the front wheel left the pavement. The squirrel <br />
screamed in anger. The Valkyrie screamed in ecstasy. I screamed in... <br />
well... I just plain screamed. <br />
<br />
Now picture a large man on a huge black and chrome cruiser, dressed in <br />
jeans, a slightly squirrel torn t-shirt, and only one leather glove <br />
roaring at maybe 70mph and rapidly accelerating down a quiet <br />
residential street... on one wheel and with a demonic squirrel on his <br />
back. The man and the squirrel are both screaming bloody murder. <br />
<br />
With the sudden acceleration I was forced to put my other hand back on <br />
the handlebars and try to get control of the bike. This was leaving the <br />
mutant squirrel to his own devices, but I really did not want to crash <br />
into somebody's tree, house, or parked car. Also, I had not yet figured <br />
out how to release the throttle... my brain was just simply overloaded. <br />
I did manage to mash the back brake, but it had little affect against <br />
the massive power of the big cruiser. <br />
<br />
About this time the squirrel decided that I was not paying sufficient <br />
attention to this very serious battle (maybe he is a Scottish attack <br />
squirrel of death), and he came around my neck and got IN my full-face <br />
helmet with me. As the faceplate closed partway and he began hissing in <br />
my face I am quite sure my screaming changed tone and intensity. It <br />
seemed to have little affect on the squirrel however. <br />
<br />
The rpm's on The Dragon maxed out (I was not concerned about shifting <br />
at the moment) and her front end started to drop. <br />
<br />
Now picture the large man on the huge black and chrome cruiser, dressed <br />
in jeans, a very ragged torn t-shirt, and wearing one leather glove, <br />
roaring at probably 80mph, still on one wheel, with a large puffy <br />
squirrel's tail sticking out his mostly closed full-face helmet. By now <br />
the screams are probably getting a little hoarse. <br />
<br />
Finally I got the upper hand... I managed to grab his tail again, <br />
pulled him out of my helmet, and slung him to the left as hard as I <br />
could. This time it worked... sort-of. Spectacularly sort-of, so to <br />
speak. <br />
<br />
Picture the scene. You are a cop. You and your partner have pulled off <br />
on a quiet residential street and parked with your windows down to do <br />
some paperwork. <br />
<br />
Suddenly a large man on a huge black and chrome cruiser, dressed in <br />
jeans, a torn t-shirt flapping in the breeze, and wearing one leather <br />
glove, moving at probably 80mph on one wheel, and screaming bloody <br />
murder roars by and with all his strength throws a live squirrel <br />
grenade directly into your police car. <br />
<br />
I heard screams. They weren't mine... <br />
<br />
I managed to get the big motorcycle under directional control and <br />
dropped the front wheel to the ground. I then used maximum braking and <br />
skidded to a stop in a cloud of tire smoke at the stop sign at a busy <br />
cross street. <br />
<br />
I would have returned to fess up (and to get my glove back). I really <br />
would have. Really. But for two things. First, the cops did not seem <br />
interested or the slightest bit concerned about me at the moment. One <br />
of them was on his back in the front yard of the house they had been <br />
parked in front of and was rapidly crabbing backwards away from the <br />
patrol car. The other was standing in the street and was training a <br />
riot shotgun on the police cruiser. <br />
<br />
So the cops were not interested in me. They often insist to &quot;let the <br />
professionals handle it&quot; anyway. That was one thing. The other? Well, I <br />
swear I could see the squirrel, standing in the back window of the <br />
patrol car among shredded and flying pieces of foam and upholstery, and <br />
shaking his little fist at me. I think he was shooting me the finger! <br />
<br />
That is one dangerous squirrel. And now he has a patrol car! <br />
<br />
I took a deep breath, turned on my turn-signal, made an easy right <br />
turn, and sedately left the neighborhood. <br />
<br />
As for my easy and slow drive home? Screw it. Faced with a choice of <br />
80mph cars and inattentive drivers, or the evil, demonic, attack <br />
squirrel of death... I'll take my chances with the freeway. Every time. <br />
<br />
And I'll buy myself a new pair of gloves.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have to admit, I've never had a run-in with a squirrel, nor do I drive a motorcycle. But I have had an encounter with a ipssed off boar that mauled my car to death for unknown reasons while I hicked around in the wood on foot.<br />
<br />
Was a bit of a surprise to come back to a wrecked car with an angry boar still working it.<br />
<br />
Eventually it got tired of it and left me with a car in need of some platework.<br />
surprisingly enough, the repair work wasn't half as expensive as I feared.</div></div><hr />
