So which &quot;should&quot; be better without any offensive AAs.<br />
<br />
Sword of the bloodsword (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=62188) and a Bone spiked crusher (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=21864) <br />
<br />
or my GSoT (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=24799) <br />
<br />
Also, maybe I should be posting this somewhere else but does flurry work with 2h weapons or just 1h weapons and in that case would ambi + flurry give me more dps then PB useing weapons like this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">08-07-2003, 03:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i parsed the 12 19 bloodsworn and 13 20 Copper hammer v GSoT and got better DPS with the 1 handers.<br />
<br />
the bone spiked cusher has a better ration than the copper hammer, so it may be that you will get more dps than a GSoT, assuming all skills are maxed.<br />
<br />
Not sure about the aggro proc of the bone spiked crusher. The bloodsworn proc is decent aggro but not as good as the GSoT imo, so for aggro id prob still plumb for the GSoT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">08-07-2003, 07:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">flurry only works on the primary hand, which includes 2hers.<br />
<br />
PB - only for 2h<br />
<br />
ambidexitry - only for 1h<br />
<br />
<br />
all other aas work on both 1h and 2h.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lessiter1</div><div class="date">08-07-2003, 07:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">GSoT will still be better agro.  It out agro'd the GBoS/Copper hammer combo.<br />
<br />
1 second stun proc is just too good to put down</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Loosscru</div><div class="date">08-07-2003, 02:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I thought the sword of the bloodsword had the same stun as the GSoT.  The lower delay would have made it proc just as much if not more then the GSoT.  Maybe I am missing something here then</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Yes you are, weapons have preset proc rates that independent of the weapons dly. If you don't believe that go ask a cleric for a demonstration of their high level hammers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nope.. different stun<br />
<br />
GSoT is a 1.00sec/65 stun<br />
<br />
Bloodsworn is 75? dd and 0.0/55 stun</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scaleclad</div><div class="date">08-07-2003, 04:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got the hammer and the sword a few days ago (the droga ones).  Not as good as my gsot for aggro, used a ranger, shaman and warrior friend to do a pretty extensive gsot vs chos/sob aggro test.  I have not played with the gbos but would think it to be superior to the gsot as long as you have a decent offhand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fatz</div><div class="date">08-07-2003, 04:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">According to Lucy, the Bloodsworn proc is 75dd, 0.0stun/65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scaleclad</div><div class="date">08-07-2003, 06:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can verify that, I procced 75dd and landed on gobbies where the chos procced 178 but did not land on gobbies.  As for the rates.  The hammer procced alot more, but not as much as the gsot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sivok Kovis</div><div class="date">08-16-2003, 11:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">gsot - procs up to 9 times a fight for me<br />
Just got a SoB and most so far is 4 per fight<br />
<br />
The gsot proc will pull a mob and keep it for a bit<br />
The SoB will get them to turn but not always keep them long. Had a hard time holding agro as compared to gsot. Not to say SoB isnt good, it did hold agro most of the time, just not as much as the gsot. I have a long sword of freedom in off hand, so I will most likely wait to get a procing weapon for my other hand before I bother using this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I use that with my CHSD, and with 2x the likly hood of a proc, its amazing how much better my agro generation is.  Though there is still that issue of the RNG....<br />
<br />
Though I have a friend who was using the droga weapons he camped today, said he was having better luck than he used to with his epics.</div></div><hr />
