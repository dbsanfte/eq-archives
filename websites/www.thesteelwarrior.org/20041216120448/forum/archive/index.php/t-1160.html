Another Tragedy<br />
<br />
I am heartbroken to have to share this, especially on the heels of Makavelie's passing. <br />
<br />
While they have not played in quite a while, Noitide (Laura) and Carott (Kellie) have been friends to many and still keep in touch with their EQ family. <br />
<br />
Last night, Laura (Noitide) and her daughter were both killed in a collision with a drunk driver. <br />

Just remember her for a second if you could. Her constant chatting and scatter-brained ways. I smile when I do that. Its hard to do that now, but I try.<br />
