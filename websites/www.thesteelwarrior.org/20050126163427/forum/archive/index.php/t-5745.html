<br />
Also, im currently 57 warrior and was wondering just how important is Bash? I rarely use it now but is it something I will use more at later levels or should I not worry too much about it? I am going to start to bring the bash skill up a bit but just wondering how imprtant it is. <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

<br />
But if you really wanted to, make a hotkey that had &quot;/do &lt;# for kick&gt;&quot; on one line and &quot;/do &lt;# for bash&gt;&quot; on another line.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Batem Tuhates</div><div class="date">02-18-2004, 01:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">/do works ? I always use /doability didn't know /do worked. good to know<br />
<br />
actually i use to normally use slam but, when in illusion have to change to kick.<br />
<br />
maybe if I had a hot key with /doability #slam in the first line and, /doability #kick in the second line it would slam when not in illusion and neglect the kick since slam was used. Then Kick when I was in illusion since the first line slam wouldn't work in illusion<br />
<br />
/shrug just a thought</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drunder50</div><div class="date">02-18-2004, 02:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK Great! I will make the hotkey with Kick and Bash.  Appreciate the help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mazzarek</div><div class="date">02-18-2004, 03:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm... yeah, I guess illusions might be a reason to link them.  Wonder if it works.  You may need a /pause 1 or something in there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mokor Leadheaad</div><div class="date">02-18-2004, 09:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">/hotkey kick bash red /do #, /do #<br />
<br />
# = 1-6 i think whatever kick and bash are.<br />
<br />
by having them on same line it will activate whatevers first the try the other in the same instant in the oreder specified.<br />
<br />
i think that comand lines right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bordaaf</div><div class="date">02-24-2004, 05:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As said above they are on same timer so having both in a hotkey will do no good unless it works as mentioned above about illusions.<br />
<br />
ONLY the pause command can be used on the same line as another command, the pause is first on line and happens after the fact i.e. /pause 20, /do 1 <br />
which would doability 1 and then pause for 2 seconds<br />
<br />
As for pause NEVER use it in any combat ability as it locks up your ability to do other things for said amount of pause</div></div><hr />

If you are a small race, its important, at least, it is for me. Bash has a higher chance of interrupting gating casters or CHs... and might save some lives... you never know. Ghetto bashing is a good way to raise and use it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sam DeathWalker</div><div class="date">02-24-2004, 09:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Might want to add taunt to that social like I do. I dont have shield so I dont bash but I kick, taunt and something.... <br />
<br />
Then map the social to a key say F1 and then tie incite to the same F1 and spam away lol......</div></div><hr />

I thought that after 55 or 57 that kick had a chance to stun like bash did?  I have a Zek crested Buckler on my war and I use it when breaking mez for the extra agro and sometimes to ghetto bash casters, but swapping out just gets so damn annoying!  That and I get people that think he's a Pally (w/ DE illusion) or a SK when I run around w/ it on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I ghetto bash almost as a reflex now, just like I can swap a bow to pull and my Gem of Contention back, or the Whip of Ensnaring and the Kunzar thingy to snare a mob when there is not snarer ingroup and swap back to normal weapon setup... I guess it just works for different ppl :)</div></div><hr />
