<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tunai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey guys, I'm wandering what is the best 2-hander aggro weapon a 40 War. can get, I'm currently using a Fabled Exe. Axe, and it's not holding the aggro very well. I can't use 1 handers, cuz I don't have good skillz in them. Thnx in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lens314</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I havent been in the 40s for a long time now, so not sure what would be good for a 2hander, BUT you will want to get ALL your weapon skills up sooner than later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I would suggest raising your 1hs/1hs/pierce skills right now; will come in handy later on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>didiaquarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Back in the day I had a Lammy / Defiance combo and felt myself quite the uber young warrior.  Moved onto a Frostbringer / Wavecrasher combo.  <br />
<br />
I still use a dual weild combo (SoD/BoC) when I have to get somethings attention and keep it.  It gets me more and more pounded from ripostes these days.  But no reason you can't use some of these combinations for some cheap decent aggro in your 40's and early 50's.<br />

DDT</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>ibithor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">if i had to guess i would say that the problem is that the weapon you are using is really slow and has no proc to help gain aggro. at 63 i use that axe sometimes when i solo for the dps but it just doesnt hold aggro very well compared to my copper hammer of striking/fabled shortsword of ykesha combo. remember to use your aggro disc if you have them yet and that helps some too.<br />
<br />
oh yeah, get 1h skills up, its silly to try and tank without them man.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">[quote]I can't use 1 handers, cuz I don't have good skillz in them[quote]<br />
<br />
Well your skills won't get better if you don't start using 1handers. :P Start working on them now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ok, well yeah, getting your 1H skills up now is the best advice.<br />
<br />
But, seriously, some people just prefer to use 2H weapons, is there nothing out there before the GSoT at 55 that is good for aggro?   :eek:</div></div><hr />

should be a few. basicly want a debuff stun or slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bonequest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Wait until level 55 to work on 2h weapons then get some fast non-procing 2h practice weapons, get haste and focus, and head to the outer camp in PoV and ask if you can help the groups there kill mobs while you work on your 2h skills.  In 2 or 3 days you can max those skills out and its not really worth doing much before that level anyway.  Once you get 2h blunt and slash up over 200 then think about getting a GSoT for tanking and perhaps a good low agro 2h slasher like a windblade or something similar for when you are not tanking.<br />
<br />
As for raising 1h weapon skills, just get some fast weapons like a lammy, a gorganga club (common drop that rots in ME zone near DSP), and some fast peircing weapon and just help some group as soon as you can.  Those skills are much more useful for now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Azaza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Unfortunately, the way the game plays out for us warriors, is that we can get away with dual wielding earlier on in the game... and generally better off with 2h later on. Roughly about 55 when the GSoT (aka Lollipop of Doom) is available.<br />
<br />
Then as your gear, hps, and groups allow... dual wielding may become an option again.<br />
<br />
Any weapon with a slow, stun, or stun w/DD ... those will help greatly at your level. If you got points to aug them (with Anger 1, or an aug with the above effects) then that should help even more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Evariste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Weapon skills have been proven to not be a factor in aggro. When your group is full and you don't need to be relied on for DPS, bust out your one-handers and go to town. <br />
<br />
I'd suggest getting a Frostbringer for now. When you hit 55, your aggro troubles will, for the most part, end with GSOT.</div></div><hr />
