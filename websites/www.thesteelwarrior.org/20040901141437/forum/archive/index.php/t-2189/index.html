<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Slowmotionz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Critical Hits/Crippling Blows - These should generate double and quadruple agro added to the damage that the hit lands for. So if you hit for 100 with a critical hit it would generate as much agro as if you hit it for 200 if it was a crippling blow it would generate as much agro as if you hit it for 400.<br />
<br />
AA Procs - To add a bit of utility to the warrior class I'm proposing that there be an option for a few AA's which would allow the warrior an instant clickable hotkey (or something which could NOT be dispelled in similar fashion to the way Donal's BP was nerfed) which would add to warrior utility without having to carry arround a dozen weapons. (Ideas for various ones could be +HATE, Lifetap, Unresistable Damage, Snare/Root, 12 second stun like the T-Staff of old). None of thsee procs would be stackable you could only have 1 active at any time.<br />
<br />
AA Horse - I think its fair to ask for a Brown/Tan AA Horse given the SK have Black and Paly have White... And Warriors always die running places...<br />
<br />
AA Endless Quiver - Please give us this, we dont need AM or anything just this... I dont deserve to shell out hundreds of platinum for good arrows, or run out of ammo when deep in the middle of some dungeon with no mage arround.<br />
<br />
Weapon Mastery - There would be a Weapon Mastery ability for each type of weapon (1hs, 2hs, 1hb, 2hb, Piercing, Archery, Throwing) which would be bought seperately. Each of these would be a CLASS (or POP) Ability. The ability would make any CRITICAL HIT from a weapon of like type and turn it into a CRIPPLING BLOW regardless of where the warriors health is, if in berserk mode then they turn into DEVISTATING BLOWS which to x2 of what a crippling blow would do (or x8 base damage)<br />
<br />
Decapitate - Level 65 innate ability, works similar to Rogue assassinate skill in that it would do 32k damage to any mob level 46 or less and have a chance (bout 50%) when a critical hit is scored. Great for impressing newbies, useful for dealing with greenie mobs that like to hurt you :)<br />
<br />
Cast like bards - Warriors shouldnt be interrupted by motion when using clicky effects. Unless stunned or bashed they should be able to use any item 'on the run'. This could also be extended to Rogue/Monks as well as its a general PVP fix. Its so annoying to use your clicky BP heal only to have a caster/greenie interrupt you with a 1 HP dagger hit.<br />
<br />
Bladeburn - Allows a warrior to strike an opponent for 1-2k damage unresistable with a 12 second stun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Buun Sofsteel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I like most of your ideas.  Some though I can't justify in my mind.  <br />
<br />
Hate on crits I have always liked in that it again distinguishes warriors from other melee.  We had crits first and they SHOULD be better than the other melee classes.<br />
<br />
AA procs I dislike.  Part of the pain in the ass for warriors has always been working/paying/questing to gain utility from weapons.  Deciding the proc seems a bit unrealistic and just too easy for me.<br />
<br />
AA Horse - Nice!  Warlord's Steed.  At level 60 the warrior has developed such an aura of charismatic power and battlefield leadership that he attracts a Warhorse to be his faithful companion.<br />
<br />
Endless quiver I can't really justify but, damn if I wouldn't be thrilled to death to have it.  I can't justify it as an ability for a ranger either though, it seems more like it should be a magical gnome tinkered item rather than some innate skill.  Yeah, I want this.<br />
<br />
Weapon Mastery - I have long thought that a war should be able to completely master one, AND ONLY ONE, weapon style similar to casters mastering alteration or evocation.  Throw a quest in there where we can give up the one and begin training in another style from ground zero and it will be perfect.<br />
<br />
Decapitate - damn good idea<br />
<br />
Cast Like Bards - no way.  magic isnt built into the psyche of the warrior.  we are pure melee and it makes sense that we have to stop and really concentrate to unlock the magical properties of a clicky item<br />
<br />
Bladeburn - Damn fine idea but remove the stun or it is way overpowered.<br />
<br />
<br />
nice post<br />
