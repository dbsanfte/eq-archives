<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">emp has always been one of my least favorite fights, along with seru, AL, and any mob that procs a stun/spinstun on the MA. i actually still think VT is fun, especially when somehow you have 31 mobs in camp at once and dont whipe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeah,I liked VT.Kept all the tanks busy and was fun clearing though long hours.Lotsa chance for funny stuff along the way hehe. :) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Conanix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks all. Its funny because the guy that was the MT was not on the first try. So he ran out to snag Emp from the rangres brought him back but I dont think he was clicking off the agro decreaser because i finaly ran up took emp away from him got him cornered and then handed it back to him after I had him in the corner. First I spammed for him to stand down and just let me keep the agro and what not. But he wouldnt he just kept attacking and since I got him cornered we were both now in the corner. LOL So i just got out of corner and  was DPS.<br />
 I did get a tell from guildleader and officers thanking me for making it so our stupid MT could corner him. LOL He has more HP and a few more AA's only reason he ever gets to tank over me.</div></div><hr />

You, sir, should be shot, quartered, hanged, gutted, and made to sleep with Gnomes. Not necessarily in that order.<br />
