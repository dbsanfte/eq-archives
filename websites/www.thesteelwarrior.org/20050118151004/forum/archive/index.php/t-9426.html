<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dacke</div><div class="date">10-18-2004, 02:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have these 2 swords right now(in bank), <br />
Gut-Piercing Longsword (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=30797) and<br />
Reinforced Sandstone-Hilt Sword (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=26073)<br />
cant use the sandstone-hilt until 45 though, to me using the sandstone in main and gut-piercing in of hand would be a nice fast combo with some taunt from the sandstone proc.<br />
<br />
Probably better ones out there but i don't have tons of cash so would this combo work and hold aggro? working on getting the anger II aug from everfrost ldon.</div></div><hr />

No. Do people care if the tank holds agro? Not really. A Frostbringer would hold agro better than the Gut-Piercing though. Cheap and iirc it procs around 40? Ac debuff &gt; low damage dd.</div></div><hr />

will check on frostbringer but seem to recall it being rather costly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">10-18-2004, 09:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think you can hold aggro with these up to around level 50, perhaps another level or two past that, at which point you will very much wish you had droga weapons. But to hold aggro with these, you're not going to be able to just hit autoattack. You have to figure out how to maximize your aggro outside your weapons.<br />
Warriors in their 40s without top-end weapons are much luckier than warriors who have the best weapons, for precisely this reason.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">arganax</div><div class="date">10-18-2004, 09:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">SotB starts procing at lvl40, and the CHoS at lvl50.  Also, I saw a SotB in the bazaar for 1250pp the other day yesterday (Quellious) so they're really cheap considering what you get for it.  I would just mainhand the sotb and offhand whatever I had laying around until lvl50 and then get a chos and be gtg for a long while.  I used the droga combo with anger augs at lvl65 for awhile and it worked very well in BoT, LDoNs, etc.  Considering you can get the combo for 8-10k or maybe even less, there's no better investment in the game that I know of.</div></div><hr />

WOW!  I usually snag them if I seem em going for around 3k or so, then tribute for 7500, good stuff for not that much.</div></div><hr />

Unless they nerfed the tribute value on Rujarkian Goblin Idol or whatever it was called (Range item with 10 atk) I bought one for 75pp and gave it to friend for tribute and it was worth 13k tribute. They usually sell around 1-3k. Good deal though.</div></div><hr />
