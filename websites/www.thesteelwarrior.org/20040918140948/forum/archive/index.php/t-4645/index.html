<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gnimwit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Trying to do searches on common warrior terms like 'ATK CAP' 'AC CAP' 'MAX DPS' among other common themes will return an error to the person doing the search because the forum is not allowing searches for words less than 4 letters in lentgh. <br />
<br />
Is this something that can be changed or is it a mandatory static setting for vBulletin?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i think it's static; one of the other boards i belong to has had the same problem...it seems that 3 letters brings up 90% of everything .<br />
<br />
we're working on getting more stuff in the library though on the basics like you were looking for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>sHORTY</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I will drop the search setting down.<br />
<br />
You will run into the problem that Shikarii stated a bit more often - but it should still be reasonable. We'll see how it works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>sHORTY</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Alright, it's changed and i'm in the process of doing a lengthy rebuild of the search index. Until it's done (a few hours from now), searching is going to be very limited and board performance is going to be hindered.</div></div><hr />
