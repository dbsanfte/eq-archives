<br />
For drops in the scar it seems that there are more drops than we know of and that there may be at least 2 timers. After picking up the stick in a few different areas and nothing but I think that there may be a few different timers so that the stick may not effect warrior items. What I think is happening is that each class of item when picked up can pop at any open pop spot that it's type can pop at. If one of those pop spots are unknown then it pops there and no one loots it so no more pops till someone stumbles on it. On day 1-2 TONS of people were wandering around so the chances of a pop spot going unfound were slim now it is getting less so.<br />
<br />
In short if your haveing problems getting the items we need check all the pop spots listed and then start looking for more in the areas with none and post them here or in the main thread.<br />
<br />
Haveing other problems catching up? Please post them here so we can keep the other thread cleaner.</div></div><hr />
