Just a quick note as to how much I appreciate this board and the good answers gotten here.<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I did him the other day. He went down so fast it was silly.<br />

An enchanter with rune of zeb and uproar, a 2nd dps class and a warrior (dont even need a disc) can take him down very easily.</div></div><hr />

Echo of Nortlav is 6boxable, no problem.  He is not always a pussy cat, but more or less is doable.<br />
<br />
I recommend, pull with incite, hit furious then evasive.   Can do mighty strike before evasive if ya want, but you will take some hits, though not too bad.<br />
<br />
I'e done him with 65 clr/dru/enc/mag/war/nec.  The fight can leave my toons with 40-60% mana or if it goes really really bad but I hold it together, I've gone oom on all of them, that includes 1 mana rod useage.<br />
<br />
Stats:<br />
Echo of Nortlav <br />
This mob [Lifetaps] [Summons] [Casts Spells] <br />
Max Hit 225<br />
Ave Hit 130<br />
DPS 140 <br />
Max Spell 1500<br />
Ave Spell 1323<br />
2 min 15 sec to kill <br />
Total HP 36654 <br />
I've spanked this mob 19 times out of 26 encounters <br />
<br />
I have seen him proc 4 times in 2 minutes and 22 times in 2 minutes, he really varies that much.  Having rune up is the lifesaver, as without it, he procs quite a bit more often.<br />
<br />
Also, keep up mem blur on your enc, as if the MT dies, just drop pets and mem blur him and he will stop killing people.  You can then rez and redo him easily.</div></div><hr />

Great info found hereing as always, only reason I am even thinking about doing him is hey I would like to have my epics... yeah I know much better bazaar weapons out there, hehe I have a few in my bags, but would still like to have them just to say I have done it.<br />
Thanks Again<br />
