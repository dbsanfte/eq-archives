<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Iceklaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Im a 41 lizard war and I need some help getting some new stuff. I dont have much money, only about 700pp, is there anything I can get with that little money that will improve my char? Hope to hear from someone soon.<br />
Here's my magelo..... http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1066492</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gaspie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">With 700pp you could buy Gothic Steel armor or two 6ac 65hp rings. You can usually find some gothic on smithing merchants in pok cheaper than what they sell it for in the bazaar. Just try to go for items with more ac, hp's, and sta.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">In many ways I'm not qualified to answer your question because none of the warriors I've played have had a tail.<br />
But the cheapest hp boost you can get is stat food: halas meat pies and grobb liquidised meat. <br />
I'd go to the bazaar and search each slot, filtering carefully by race, reliegion and class of your character. Take notes on the best AC/pp ratio among your various options, then buy the best of the best.<br />
You can often get sandblasted and gothic stuff in PoK from the dwarf vendors in the building with the forge in it. About 100 pp per piece; most would be upgrades for you (heh, check to make sure lizards can wear it). Match that stuff against the bazaar options you have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Iceklaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thank you guys, Ill give gothic armor a shot</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mukaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">A Coterie general cape <br />
Orc fang earrings<br />
Gothic steel armor in your visible slots<br />
<br />
You won't be able to get it all on 700pp but you can get a good chunk. Focus on upgrading all of your low ac or zero hitpoint gear first.</div></div><hr />
