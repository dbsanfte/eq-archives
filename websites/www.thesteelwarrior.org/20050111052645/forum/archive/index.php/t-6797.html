We are doing  this trial as an alliance. As our guilds alone cant do it. So they tell me. I have been on this raid 2.  I know they killed him once but i was told they got lucky. We have 3-4 9K + tanks at a time between the 2 guilds. Most we have been getting when we go to try and do this trial is 45+ They say that 45 is not enough.<br />
 We spawn him have the clerics on the right in the hall with the tank on the left right as you enter the room. He tries to corner him. Last time we did him we were buged like 95% of all other raids. the cornering thing. RD spawned in the wall and MT fell through the wall.<br />
 Please help with some strat on how to do this guy. I would like to get over this hump and move on to bertox and  the rest of tactics, and so on so forth.<br />
Thank you in advance. <br />
Oh ya AoW down woot. got me helm.</div></div><hr />

Piece it all together and you'll have a win =) we did with 42 a few nights ago hehe</div></div><hr />

The real key here, as in many places, is to keep a taunty tank up with high MR.  <br />
<br />
We just use a bard in the MT/SA group and spam quicker heals with the occasional MGB SoTW/Paragon/Elixer.  I'd recommend just taking her on in the middle of the room though, not much point in playing with the pillars.  Our early fails were all related to pillar-poofing.  Use melee in the semi-circle with the MT's back to the casters like any open-field encounter and she should stay reasonably stable for you.  Sometimes people use things like WS rangers but that's more a question of preferance I think.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, RD is certainly tougher than the fights before her.  She is not impossible though by any stretch, although your class composition will dictate tactics.  Definitely the easiest method is likely the charm-pet version, although we don't use it ourselves.</div></div><hr />
