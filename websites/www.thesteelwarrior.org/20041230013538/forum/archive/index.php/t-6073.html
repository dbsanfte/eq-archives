It kind of includes armor too. Ok I wanna make my first Warrior after years of play. I dont know what race but i hate Evil races no offense life is just easier on the good side =) and i dont like dwarves. So who should I use. And what kind of items should I buy to start off with. Im not rich either so nothing highly expensive. and For the record before someone ask i play on Tarew Marr.<br />
<br />
Thanks everyone</div></div><hr />

<br />
The most important thing now is choosing Rallos Zek as your deity (or the tribunal if you choose to be a half elf or barbarian) which gives you access to some very good cultural armour (almost as good as ornate for 1/10th the price).<br />
<br />
My advice is to play what ever you like the look of, personally I chose half elf for their pimp looks, but go with whatever you prefer.  <br />
<br />
Woodelves have the bonus of hide skill, halflings get sneak+hide and an XP bonus which makes them a good choice, barbarians get slam and a few more starting stats than the other good races.  None of these things will effect how good a tank you will be at high levels tho.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Gnomes have a mob cornering benefit.<br />
<br />
If I had my time over again, I would be a RZ gnome and pump up CHA on creation.  And no, I am not being crazy.<br />
<br />
I am, however, a Tribunal worhsipping warrior.<br />
<br />
RZ or Tribunal cultural really is the way to go for nice hps/ac/sta.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And do any of you play on tarew marr</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">03-09-2004, 09:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd say there are basically two things you can do for newbie armor.<br />
1. Buy a mix of crafted and crusty armor (or anything else in that price range that gives you similar stats) in the bazaar; simply search by slot and and price and if some is available, it'll pop up. Either armor will last you for a while. Haven't priced the stuff for a long time and I play on Fennin Ro, but I would think you'll pay 100-200 pp per piece for most of it.<br />
2. Create your warrior &amp; do the newbie armor quests.<br />
Although option 2 takes a lot longer (and probably only delays the crafted/crusty buying), it does offer a couple of advantages. First, it costs your main very little, if that's a concern. Second, by the time you finish/get sick of the newbie armor quests, you'll be used to the basic mechanics of what a warrior does, and if you don't already know the starting city, you will by the time you finish. You'll also know whether or not you want to keep playing him, probably. <br />
I completely agree about picking either RZ or Tribunal as your deity. Cultural armor will eventually be your friend.<br />
If you like doing tradeskills, warriors make decent smiths; if you want to do that, I'd consider making a human warrior, as they have a relatively reasonable cultural skill-up path in smithing that is not available to, for example, Barbarians.<br />
Really, though, race doesn't matter much; the religion thing does, at least at the moment.<br />
It sort of depends on how you are going to approach this warrior: if you want to level him fast and can afford to twink him a bit, pick an RZ or Tribunal worshipping race in a starting city you already know well, get him crusty/crafted, some relatively fast weapons in each category (1HS, 1HB, 2HS, 2HB, piercing), solo the newbie grounds, hit blackburrow at level 6 or so, then PC (bleh) then M Seru, then High Hold Keep (bleh) and by then you'll have sorted yourself out a bit.<br />
If you're not so concerned with fast leveling but would like to see more of the game, then pick a race that can worship RZ or Tribunal in a city you don't know, and do the newbie quests and go forth to adventure.<br />
I play a Barb; he was my first character and I picked him in complete ignorance, but I'm very happy with him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LastLizard</div><div class="date">03-09-2004, 09:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">RZ worshipping human isn't the worst choice. <br />
Personally, I would avoid too large or too smalle races, because most of the time it's more convenient and feels better to be medium sized when you tank different mobs in Exp groups - with short races you have to look upwards and with large races downwards quite often.<br />
<br />
Crusty/Crafted/LDoN smithed equipment (calcified or something.. the STA one).. below ~5kpp I'd say as 1st twink gear. <br />
After twinking and untwinking several alts, I found that spending a lot of money (relative to your budget) on a twink is a bit risky if you find that the class is not really something for you (usually in the late 40ies). Less twinking in the beginning will give you a better feel for what a class is capable of doing later and less risk of losing money when you try to sell the twink stuff. <br />
(Sure you can twink a war with fungi, AoB items and kickass weapons and solo to 60, but then the &quot;reality&quot; of playing a pretty limited class will get as soon as the mobs get harder.)<br />
<br />
..And if you want to be very, very special, make an Iksar Warrior :D</div></div><hr />

For starting stats (which dont mean as much as they used to), barbarians are solid.  They have good faction in every good aligned city, and they can slam, which is still a nice advantage.  Small races have their own set of irritations just like large races do.  I'd say Tribunal worshipping barbarian or RZ worshipping small race if you want to be good aligned, whichever suits you.  Ultimately, play what you like, gear &gt; race.<br />

<br />
Depends on the mob.  Most mobs don't need any further shrink, but some mobs like the Ancients down in ST do require further shrinkage.<br />
<br />
Gnomes = No further shrinkage EVER.  Them bastids!</div></div><hr />

I've never seen a halfling actually need a shrink, even though they can. I know for certain they can tank unshrunk in all the places that give me the most trouble.</div></div><hr />

<br />
also, having gotten used to being so shrunk, even on normal exp mobs these days ill get at least 1 shrink if not 2.<br />
<br />
however, not getting stunned really is something that i enjoy as an ogre, althoughthis can be overcome to some extent with AAs.<br />
<br />
but overall, id probably still pick a little gnomer rz worshipping warrior. ikkzy warrior would be another choice, only cos they are really really rare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomos</div><div class="date">03-10-2004, 06:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">RZ gnome is definitely the way to go.  We corner the best, and we get clockwork watchman vambraces.  40% clicky haste baby, when there is no chanter around, and they're pretty cheap.<br />
<br />
As for gear, that depends on your budget.  For twinking out, you want to stick with old world gear with no minimum levels.  The best haste item available will probably be cloak of flames, 36% haste and 50 hp.  Swiftblade of zek works nice, 11/18 and +100 hp.  Horn of Hsagra works nice in offhand.  If you want aggro holding, then go with copper hammer of striking.<br />
<br />
For armor, you can either try to MQ thurg or shyshrine armor, or buy cobalt, it has no minimum level.  Also, look for gear with lots of HP.<br />
<br />
What server do you plan on making your warrior on?  If you make one on Firiona Vie, there is a lot more gear available, as most everything is tradable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not to mention the boots with +30 dex that'll stack with all but NDT/Garou.  Comes in quite handy when you are relying on procs.  Lasts an hour too.  And I love my breastplate, 10 uses of invis per recharge.  Not as good as cobalt legs or incardine...but better than most else.<br />
<br />
I like being efficiently sized.  Can't stand it when people grow me.  Throws off my perception of how close I am to the mob.  Only annoying thing about being efficiently sized is certain steps, like the ones in Kael or the entrance to PoF.  Got to jump to get in.  PoF is especially annoying, as druids just use SoE these days and levitation means no jumping.<br />
<br />
But it is worth it to see all the rest of the party hiding behind a little girl.<br />
<br />
For cultural, the ogre CT armor (wearable by ogres and trolls) is also worth mentioning.  It offers the highest ac of any cultural and the second highest hp from sta/hp (Tribunal being the first).  The Rallos armor clocks in at 3rd, but offers good +dex and the most pure +hp.  But since the original poster doesn't want to be evil...well, doesn't apply to him;)</div></div><hr />

(she also has a gnome tinkerer with 245 skill so the armor is what decided us).<br />
<br />
Either she has a 5% penalty or I have a 5% bonus. Either way... when she was level 20, I was 21.<br />
<br />
My brother plays with us, a half elf rogue, and it's hard to calculate since we don't play with him 100% of the time like we do eachother but we think I'm out leveling him by 5% also.<br />
<br />
5% might not sound like much, but put into perspective... When she is 61 3/4 I will be 65. For those at 65 that's 1 extra AA for every 20 and that's just to a gnome cleric, we did group with a troll SK once and I was out leveling him by a large margin.<br />
<br />
Guess I need some more testing on if I have a bonus or her a penalty, but I'm guessing they gave us gnomes a bonus cause our base str/dex is pretty bad. I can't imagine why they would penalize a gnome cleric.</div></div><hr />

Trolls get a penalty unless they changed it.</div></div><hr />

Some other races and classes have penalties based on relative power.  Trolls have a racial penalty, and at one time SK's had a class penalty, but I think that class penalty has been removed.  Pre-expansions, troll sk was by far the most difficult class to level in terms of xp cost.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zarq Heartswort</div><div class="date">03-18-2004, 03:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">really depends on where you plan on taking this charecter.   If you play casually with very few raiding plans, I'd go with the Tribunal Barby.  Very easy to gear up Helenic Tundra is the best of the cultrual for a warrior.  The high end raid issues like CHA and cornering wouldn't be a concern.  Stats i'd put points into Dex as you'll be getting plenty of STA from the cultural.  <br />
<br />
If you want to get him up to high level tanking, the rz gnome with CHA is probably your best choise for all the reasons stated above.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">03-18-2004, 09:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Zarq makes a couple of good points.<br />
Tundra armor has relatively high STA, which is nice for the non-raiding warrior.<br />
And Barbs can wear both medium and large plate, which expands your bazaar options/good deals more than you might think.<br />
Tend to agree about the gnome stuff.<br />
Really, though, the different races mean that you have to &quot;make up for&quot; different problems. You can deal with any of them.<br />
Right after the Frogs took over Troll town and warriors (finally) got some help with the agro issues, I rolled a Troll SK. He's got no hometown, he's stupid, he levels painfully slowly, there are a lot of places it's dangerous for him to go and travel is a pain, it's a struggle to find armor he can wear and weapons he can use, he can't make his own cultural armor, he's untwinked, and he's ugly.<br />
He's also heck of a lot of fun. He goes around killing stuff and then, whenever possible, eating it. Life is good.<br />
If a gimpy untwinked Troll sk can be fun, heh, you'll enjoy playing a warrior if you are the sort of person who enjoys playing a warrior. If you don't like being a warrior, then the race you pick certainly won't matter.</div></div><hr />

You are forgetting that gnomes have +25% innate suck.  This is hard to get around but occaisionally someone can compensate for it.</div></div><hr />
