I was in a LDON last night and needed 2% to ding 65. Well the dungeon timer ran out before I got that last 2%. We won the Ldon and we used the last 30 min to try to get my ding.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">graderr</div><div class="date">06-27-2004, 02:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">because you focus to much on it... like the saying a watched pot doesn't boil. in the last bue you are expecting to hear the ding sound and don't want to get cought off guard, so you tend to look at your exp more then when it is at any other place. also has to do with the long minute and the short minute.</div></div><hr />

<br />
in this case I just think his stance is weak.</div></div><hr />

but I have a good laugh more often then not reading his posts. Althought he does take geting used to.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Gnomers = Banned from a name once because he refused to stop slinging shit instead of stating his opinion, even when asked nicely, and then on his new name, given a &quot;Timeout&quot; for telling someone to get the fuck out of here.<br />
<br />
Now, it's true that Isk doesn't have the stones to ban me, see, because I'm important. I carry a lot of weight around here.  Me walking into a discussion is akin to the Pope coming to dinner, and Gnomers is just like that guy that sells peanuts at the stadium, but that's just details.  Fact of the matter is that even tho I have this annoying tendancy to always be right, and I&quot;m pretty abrasive, I'm still an American favorite, and you're still just Gnomers.<br />
<br />
Not that there's anything wrong with that.</div></div><hr />

Gnomers wasn't banned I changed his email address that did not exist any mod can confirm that.  I made this username after a little Hiatus from here,  if you remember that thread at all.   <br />
<br />
Yes I got a 1 week ban for telling that known asswipe to fuck off.  Am I sorry, no I can't say I am since that poster is a known troll that will just spam this board with nothing but stupid WoW links. <br />
<br />
<br />
Isk doesn't have the balls to ban you, you are important,  I see is post from sad lonely disgruntled guy.  The rest I will take as sarcasm because anyone can't be that dilluted to think who post like a disgruntled postal worker to be any importance to this message board or even in his sad pathetic every day life.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well first, I know sarcasim is sometimes hard to catch, but that's what Haass' post was and second, a guy that hasn't seen pussy since birth shouldn't tell someone that is married and has a kid about his sad and lonely life.</div></div><hr />
