<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">It appears to me that there's a trend happening, of which the warrior issue is merely a part of, and symptomatic of the larger trend. That trend is erosion of of the role that the specialist classes have... by the hybrids. <br />
<br />
Examples:<br />
<br />
Haste/slow, what used to be role of chanters and shamans for haste and slow, can now be done by beastlords and bards.<br />
<br />
The obvious one here, the tanking erosion of warrior specialist by hybrid tanks...<br />
<br />
The traditional cleric healing role now being able to be taken by druids and clerics...<br />
<br />
Beastlords able to buff and slow almost as well as a shaman, making then not as needed as before...<br />
<br />
Monks being eclipsed in many places as pullers by bards, and to a lesser extent, rangers or druids...<br />
<br />
Rogue picklock/traps becoming less and less needed, or in many cases, even rogues cannot disarm some traps, needing a caster to do what previously only a rogue could do...<br />
<br />
rogue/monk DPS being eclipsed by caster DPS...<br />
<br />
I see caster classes all getting these new and improved abilities and spells, that allow them to fill roles that used to be class defining for other classes. Yet I also see the pure melee getting absolutely nothing new along the same lines that allow them to fill another classes's role.... pure melee are still the exact same boat they were in in Velious... sure they have better stats on armour and weapons, but they have no new and improved abilities.<br />
<br />
From the way I see it, I see that now's the time to be a hybrid, this is their &quot;golden age&quot;. Specialists, however...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">As far as groupability and as a game concept  is concerned i 'prefer' the enhanced options for mix and match grouping that more diversity provides, unfortunately so long as they continue to pigeonhole warriors and not provide them equality in aggro (and therefore in tanking) with their competitors AND extra utility to give them a fall back position of worth they (we) will remain at a disadvantage.<br />
<br />
This applies to monks, and to a lesser extent clerics and rogues  also.</div></div><hr />
