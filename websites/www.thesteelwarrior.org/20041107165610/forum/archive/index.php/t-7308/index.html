<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>irmingnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was wondering if they raised the level requirement for level 15 DO.  I know the rule of three if the level of enchantment is level 15 you are allowed to equip it at level 12.  <br />
<br />
<br />
I went to Cookes Electronics in Skyway city to get my very  first DO for my Technology/Blaster.  I was lucky enough to read the description of the DO before i bought it.  IT was a level 15 damage DO and it stated that I need to be  at security level 13 to use it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Did they raise the level limit for DO's or did I go to the wrong place to purchase them</div></div><hr />

If they have, it was completely unannounced.  Might want to double check on that, I'd be surprised if they've done this.</div></div><hr />

Were you replacing a current DO or trying to combine it with one? Remember you can equip them at 3 levels lower but you cannot combine them till two levels lower.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>irmingnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I was trying to buy one, I never owned/purchased any DO's the only enchantments I had was the regular one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Actually, IIRC, the message you got was light blue and said 'You can use this enhancement, but you cannot upgrade it until Security Level 13' - meaning no combines. They don't combine with training enhancements anyways, so it's kinda moot at 12.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>irmingnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Partha you are correct,  I didn't read it correctly. <br />

I bought  4 DOs today and was able to use them.  Sorry</div></div><hr />
