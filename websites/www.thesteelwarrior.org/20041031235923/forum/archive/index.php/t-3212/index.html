<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Chagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So I was speaking with one of my good friends (an SK) who seems to stay up with the SK boards.  We were talking about augs and I pointed to some posts on the warrior boards which basically indicated that warriors were choosing Yakesh over Anger for aggro.  He then mentioned that SKs were in favor of life tap procs (hey, they’re SKs) for DPS/utility and Yakesh for DPS/Aggro.<br />
<br />
At first I thought he was joking.  He has always been very sympathetic to my warrior woes, and seems to understand the issues better than most people.  So anyway, what the hell is going on here?  Is Yak both the best + aggro AND DPS increase?  What are they trying to accomplish by doing this?<br />
<br />
I’ve tried to avoid making this another “warriors are getting shafted (again)” post but I’m confused as to why they would compound our aggro issues by making our aggro procing augs desirable to other classes for DPS purposes.<br />
<br />
Thoughts?</div></div><hr />
