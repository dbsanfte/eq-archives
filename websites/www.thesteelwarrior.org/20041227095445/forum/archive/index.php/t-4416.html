<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valorie</div><div class="date">11-18-2003, 07:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was talking ingame to one of our server top end warriors and he suggested double ripost as a good aa. He told me in terms of getting stunned it has helped keep agro on him?<br />
<br />
I know a lot of warriors on these boards say its not very useful, but has any one who has it noticed (or tested) to see if you get any benefit at all from it.<br />
<br />
I am 5 points away from marshall and am wondering if its worth while going double ripost 2 or should I just be patient and go the flurry route (I dont want to get rampage)<br />
<br />
Cheers,</div></div><hr />

<br />
More swings means more procs plus Flurry is great all the time where double riposte is only useful (if at all) when you are MT.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The double riposte AA is only good for when you are tanking.<br />
<br />
The Flurry AA is good all the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">11-18-2003, 10:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd assume people believe riposte attacks give you aggro like any other attack.  This is a valid assumption since it's pretty hard to test it and it make sense.  Though I really don't think double rispote is the difference between having aggro or not.<br />
<br />
It's a solid DPS disc if you're tanking with a good 2hander.  Maybe even better than most offensive AAs you can get if you spend most of your time tanking.</div></div><hr />
