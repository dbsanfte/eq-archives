<br />
Imo its the most idiotic thing to do a ground spawn pickup in a zone where all newbies will be in cause you'll be sure that they will pick it up and if its a long respawn , well joy.<br />
<br />
Whoever tunes this need to really shorten respawn cause at the moment i am on 4 hours and counting cause a guildie of mine got 3 pages at server up and none have respawned.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The branch and the glowing thing in the zone are on fast as hell respawn timers. Why not the pages?</div></div><hr />

I logged in this morning (just before noon eastern) and found all four pieces plus the ore.  In fact, only two of the spawn locations were actually missing bags.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Reason:  because there was a server downage last night and you got lucky  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">09-16-2004, 05:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I very much doubt that no warrior on Bertox looked for epic pieces for 5 hours after the server reset. :)<br />
<br />
Someone else reported that some of the pages were respawning quickly today for a while, then stopped.  I have a feeling that the respawn time is simply random.<br />
<br />
I suggest rather than sit there waiting for a piece, just log out there each time you log off.  Whenever you login, you can check most of the spawn points in about 2 minutes, because they are so close to each other.<br />
<br />
I marked them all on my map so I could find them easily.</div></div><hr />
