<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ramirezz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is there a secret Warrior channel where all warriors from all servers link up to?   The reason I ask is cause some monk I group with was talking in the &quot;sensei channel&quot; which is 60 plus monks chat in from all servers.     I think that is a good idea in away for info or just other experiances others warriors can provide with others.</div></div><hr />

Your monk friend was probably talking about &quot;The Dojo&quot; <br />
<br />
The Dojo is a place for the uber monks to talk.<br />
<br />
<br />
I must warn you though. TSW channel is absolute nonsense sometimes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grendonbb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">TSW channel is absolute nonsense sometimes <br />
<br />
I agree with everything but the last word in that statement.  Leave it out, and it'd be much more accurate :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Apoco1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">no kidding...sometimes???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The nonsense is enjoyable sometimes, plus it's been established that it's full on nonsense. If you don't like it, start your own channel :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Varf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">isnt there a high end warrior channel too that is abaivble to people qualified at high end warriors?<br />
<br />
i have been looking around for who to talk to on this if anyone knows please PM or post, thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">thedojo!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Thaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">the regular channel is basically for the majority of non-ubers to kill time.<br />
<br />
Dima and his BP links, the A Flaming Head gag.<br />
<br />
Definately a good way to pass the time if you're bored, and informative if you're persistant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gerald</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'm in there from time to time but it really is nonsense filled most of the time, and just something to distract you/pass the time when you're bored. Many times I leave the channel though (I autojoin when I login) because it's just too silly...<br />
<br />
There's supposed to be another channel but you have to be in an uber time guild and, oh nos!, earn their respect to join! I suppose it keeps out the morons but they can keep their speshul weapunz and taktikz channel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ramirezz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">hmmmm I guess I will stick the forums then 8P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Dima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">You will become one with the sekrits $$</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">/autojoin serverwide.dima:$$$</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Binnamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">It's gives me something to do while uh, playing EQ!<br />
<br />
It's nice to have a place to go where things arn't serious 100% of the time and you can goof off and such.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Not that I've joined the channel more than a couple of times (multiple channels does my head in :p ) but lots of time LFG probably translates to Lots of time goofing off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Varaho</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">You can only get asked to give adivce on what to gear up some casters alt with so many times before you go crazy....  :p<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
But seriously, what did you expect it to be, all gear all the time? Or maybe a play by play comentary of whatever is being tanked at the moment to get leet infoz on how to kill things?<br />
<br />
<br />
If you are looking for a place to hang out while the pull team is trying to split mobs, or while you spend your 4 hours in a row lfg then you might as well come in have some sencless fun.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh and I leave the channel sometimes, but mostly cause the links give me lag.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Prytty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">/autojoin serverwide.dima:$$$ <br />

all BP  all the time.... :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Dima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Hoho yes it is fun of most $$</div></div><hr />
