That would be really cool.  They could team up with Fippy and that evil dark elf from Nro.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you were a 'good' race and hunted in West Commonlands at all, dark elf hate can be summed up in two words: Dragoon Zytl.<br />
<br />
When I was high enough level to defeat him on my own, I made sure everytime I was in zone, I found him and beat him down out of common decency!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">The same can be said for Dorn in north ro.  He is either 14th or 15th level, and pre-expansions, back when if you had full banded and 2 langseaxes at 15th level you were obviously some sort of demigod, he would rip through a full group of 10th-15th level characters like they werent there.  (saw a 22 ranger try to solo him once and get mauled) So if you were of the appropriate level to hunt the derv camps, and he spawned, you got an all expense paid trip to your bind point.  Like I said,  I still kill that little BASTARD every time I run through there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Beo and I had the same EQ childhood :D <br />
<br />
Dorn is an evil dude.<br />
<br />
I also kill Sgt Slate everytime I see him...another old nemesis</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Seargent Slate was my power measuring block in my 50's.<br />
<br />
I remember running from him when he was at 60%, 50%, 40%, 30%, 20%, and then his stupid ass turning around one day while I double bloodpointed my hps back up ha ha on you!<br />
<br />
I leave him alone most of the time now due to no desire to run through EC to anywhere anymore.<br />
<br />
P.S. Every mob so far mentioned was on my shit list.<br />
<br />
&lt; - - iksar</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Gyzz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I remember Altunic Jartin in EC busting my ass one time before I had killed enough orcs to become non-kos.  Eventually I think I got to amiable, but I still got out of his way every time he wandered past Orc 2.<br />
<br />
Oh, and I don't even want to talk about Slate.  I owe that guy a lifetime of beatdowns.  <br />
<br />
I have to admit, though, I did get some sadistic pleasure watching Dorn &amp; Dragoon Zytl beat down light-skinned folks.  There weren't many perks to be a Troll back in the day, but those instances were certainly one of the few.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Heafstaag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">No mention of Tovax or that Windstalker beotch from Qeynos Hills?<br />

Qeynos noobs represent!!  <br />
<br />
They were only problems if you attacked bears!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Cros Treewind was the first mob in EQ to kill me.  I was 5th level, and saw a barbarian shamaness being killed by a bear, I helped her, and Cros killed me in one nuke.  Holly Windstalker ( A.K.A The Bitch) took over for him and killed me many, many times when I was doing the rabid pelt quests.  I leveled a troll SK to 30 just so I could kill her over and over without killing my warrior's Qeynos/Surefall faction. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Heafstaag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">The rabid bears and wolves would attack everyone and then Holly would assist them. Tovax was just plain evil and I died to him many times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Frax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Tovax, was always fun being fear kited by an NPC when you were level 4 and had no fucking idea what was going ong!  (@#*&amp;(@#&amp;@!!!!!!!!!!   I still kill that mofo everytime i come thru Qeynos Hills, along with Holly and Cros :/ they made life hell for a young warrior who always seemed to run into the rabid bears/wolves :(</div></div><hr />
