<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>HaZZy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello. After a long time, I've decided to come back to EQ (mainly to pass time until EQ2 / WoW comes out). I have a lvl 46 ogre warrior, with decent equipment, but nothing *really* good. I was wondering where I can group for good xp or maybe solo somewhere. Thanks a lot.<br />
<br />
Weapons: main - goranga club, offhand - centi ls, haste - schw<br />
also have - wurmy, zealot's sword</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>HaZZy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I was thinking of that too, but I leveled there from 42 to 46 (at 45 it was hell, even with the patch that fixed that). I'm sick and tired of DL with those ugly ass spiders, giant monkeys and giants. I also tried Karnor's Castle, but noone seems to want a lvl 46 war in their group. Plus xp is below desirable, at least at my level.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sullon One</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">you could try burning woods</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fulrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">personally, i'd just buy alot of food/water and hang out at the zoneline from KC to DL and LFG back and forth there. Its what I did to get to level 48, then i went to plane of justice until i was 53. The xp is really good for high 40's low 50's. then i went to Plane of Innovation till 54 and Plane of Nightmares till 56 and a mix between Plane of Nightmares/Innovation and Plane of Storms.<br />
The best advice i can give you is to not give up. The early bird get the worm they always say, So maybe its your timing? anywayz that was my routine and it helped pretty good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>HaZZy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Cool thanks. I think I might try that, even though I really dont like DL... then Im gonna try hitting up PoV.. I heard it's insanely good xp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">at 46. PoV won't be a option. you can't get in without getting flagged until 55. maybe maybe PoJ. but definately not PoV. i can't tank in PoV yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>HaZZy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Whoopsie of course I ment PoJ <br />
<br />
Sorry noob mistake :\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gyzz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Granted, it was a long time ago, but I was doing bats/bugs in Sol B at 46.  Get a healing partner and a rogue for dps and you'd chew through them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Garoar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Echo Caverns has a nice xp bonus, the underbulks are nice and the skellies are really decent xp, I was getting great xp there til 51 - 52.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Aegamin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I've not had the chance to hunt in the Planes yet.  How would one get to this Plane of Justice?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Go to Plane of Tranquility from PoK - wander round till you find the 'Scales of Justice' on the hillside and klick on them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">err or even click :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Aegamin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Great.  Thank you. :D</div></div><hr />
