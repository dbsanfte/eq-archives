<br />
Seriously, though...you really think the proc'ing of your copper hammer makes up for the horrible ratio at your level? I can appreciate an interest in impressing others with how great your gear is, but have some sense about it. And if you say it's for aggro purposes....I hardly recall aggro even being a consideration pre-50. <br />
<br />
Whatever. Just seems absurd to buy level restricted stuff well before you're able to use it, considering how quickly the prices collapse on things.</div></div><hr />

I hit harder with the hammer at 32 than I was when I had a frostbringer in offhand.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Friedrick</div><div class="date">08-04-2003, 02:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Get some weapons that will actually do some damage at your level.  9/19 and 7/20 aren't really damaging weapons for you.  By the time you get that POS in your onhand to proc you could have had the mob killed and the slow would be unecessary.  And if you say you need aggro you should be hung upside down by your toenails.  At 32 your warrior with his gear should be soloing but even grouped you could hold aggro with a rusty spoon at that level.<br />
<br />
I think a Blade of Carnage and Scepter of Destruction should be the weapons you shoot for.  Good damage and aggro at your level, best of both worlds.</div></div><hr />
