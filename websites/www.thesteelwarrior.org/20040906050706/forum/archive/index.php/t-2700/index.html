<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>FrenzyBarbarian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I need help with getting the Spiroc Wingblade my last piece for the warrior epic. If somebody knows the best to get one and how to plan a PoSky raid please reply 8)<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Get 24 people.<br />
Go to Sky.<br />
Kill the mobs on the island (except for the dorf dude) and have all 24 people loot the keys.<br />
After the last mob is killed, the uber halfling will spawn.<br />
Hand him your keys and move to next island.<br />
Repeat until you're on the correct island. :)<br />
<br />
Maybe someone can elaborate better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>FrenzyBarbarian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Does each mob drop a key?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Most every mob drops a piece that you must turn in to Sirran the Lunatic in order to get the key for the next island. The zone is a pain in the ass, but parts of it are fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The zone is a pain in the ass, but parts of it are fun<br />
<br />
That is not true my friend, PoA with People=Keys is a PURE BLAST<br />
(and a challenge for bzzzzzats/spirocs/ Veeshan Twins)<br />
<br />
But as soon as there's som SC'ing the zone sucks.<br />
<br />
Its a 2 day trip, as for the difficulty ...<br />
<br />
I would say 4 PoV/PoS/BoT capable groups wont have trouble.<br />
(Dont remember what islands are safe, but camping a rezer<br />
on some islands is a wise choice).<br />
<br />
There is a guide out there, just lost the URL.<br />
<br />
PoA with 24 and a puller that knows the zone = Fun<br />
PoA with 40+ and little spoilers/info = NIGHTMARE<br />
<br />
<br />
Btw : make up some nice DT ooc/shouts<br />
<br />
&quot;Who's gonna get her ass kicked ?????&quot;<br />
A spiroc lord shouts &quot;EMILIA&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Garoar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I know its lame but I got my Spiroc blade in the auction channel, sadly on my server NO-ONE goes to PoSky anymore so really was my only option, paid 20K for the MQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>FrenzyBarbarian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Just a question..<br />
<br />
How do you know if somebody MQ's the Spiroc Wingblade. I have done multiple MQs and know how they work. Will Kargrek say something or turn around towards you? just scared if it fails all my epic stuff will be gone</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Luczifer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Not as hard, no need 4 groups, we did it with 2 groups.<br />
And that was overkill.<br />
Ya need some DT eaters only at spirioc island and fghting lord.<br />
If enough DPS then 2-3 DT eaters enough.<br />
And now when island keys don poof, ya can every time go and farm items<br />
Best way to have necro SC with keys and cleric for rez.<br />
They run upto Spirios's and all group killed at dorf buddy, then SC rez and start where ya need</div></div><hr />

<br />
this link has links to many guides for raiding, including several to the plane of sky.<br />
The thing is, they are just guides and no guide can give you the experience to pull this raid off like actually being there and doing it for yourself.<br />
My suggestion is to review the guides, then gather 24 of your friends/guildmates and go get yer wingblade.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Currently, the PoA keys no long poof when you camp, so, you can go one day with your friends, get everyone keyed and come back the next day or some other day whenever you want and climb up using the keys you already got :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Noen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Was just going to say that I can back that up about the keys not disappearing anymore.  Went there last night, got to isle three and still have the keys today.  :) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Garoar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">He didnt say anything upon turn in, so you wont see text that I know of, so I guess someone could screw you, make sure they link it to you before turn in so at least you know its the correct item, and /log on , and screen shot, GM's will NOT assist on failed MQ's but peoples rep's get shot fast, either way yes you can still get screwed :confused:</div></div><hr />
