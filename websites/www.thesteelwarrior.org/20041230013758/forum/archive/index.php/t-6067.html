<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dirge</div><div class="date">03-08-2004, 11:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My warrior just hit 30th and received the /shield ability.  I've never heard of this before.  I'm familiar with the GoD focused will (10th) and provoke (20th) skills, and the earlier disciplines, like resistance (30th), fearless (40th), etc, but /shield is news to me.<br />
<br />
Anything else I'm missing?  Is this a new ability and where would I find more info. on it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Korinn_emarr</div><div class="date">03-08-2004, 11:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Do a forum search for /shield.  I am sure you will find more than enough info on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">03-08-2004, 12:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In brief: if you target a player and type /shield, or type /shield Playername without targetting them, then you will take part of the melee damage that the other player receives.  The other player receives 1/2 damage and you receive 3/4 of their damage (yes, this means some extra damage is produced).  You have to be really close to the person you are shielding, basically within arm's reach of them.  You don't have to keep them targetted, though.  You can continue fighting and doing everything else you normally do, as long as both of you stay close to each other.<br />
<br />
Shield lasts 12 seconds and recycles every 3 minutes.  Use it anytime a fragile party member is getting beaten on.  You will be able to use it every 2nd fight or so, if needed.  It's more useful once you reach the level where your healers have Complete Heal, because then there's an actual mana advantage to having one person take most of the group's damage.  At later levels you can get AA's that let you extend the duration up to 48 seconds and increase the range.  Equipping a shield is supposed to reduce the extra 25% damage produced when you /shield, but as far as I can tell, this has always been broken.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">03-08-2004, 01:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Everything Sassinak said is correct as far as I know; I'd also add three more points:<br />
1. You can hotkey this like so: /shield &lt;your slower's name&gt;. If mob jumps that player, you just run over to them, mash that button, and you never have to untarget the mob. <br />
2. Shield very much appears to have a taunt element to it. Quite often you will find that the mob turns back on you immediately after you hit your shield hotkey. I haven't done controled tests on this, so I can't tell you exactly what the hate component is. And, the history of players' understanding of game mechanics is a history of people who were &quot;sure&quot; of something they hadn't tested, and were later found to be wrong. Nevertheless, I'd be shocked if /shield didn't add to your hate.<br />
3. You will have to tell your groupmates how this works, at least at first. You do have to be close to the character you're shielding, which means that your casters can't be running around in circles or doing other stupid things when they get hit. They just need to stand real close to you. When you shield someone, everyone can see a message something like, &quot;So-as-so begins to use you as a living shield&quot;--so it does look like you're doing something, which I have found has a calming effect on the more nervous casters. Shield can also be used to help enchanters who are trying to control the mob by re-mezzing it (and don't want you to be hitting that mob). The damage you absorb helps the chanter last a bit longer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elroy</div><div class="date">03-08-2004, 02:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i would agree with shield have some kinda taunt or agro value...<br />
it appears that almost immediately the mob turns his attention to me when i hit my shield Hot key....  im not sure if the mob turns to me due to him hitting me and the caster or if this actually grabs agro..<br />
<br />
I highly recommend making a hot key for this or two..<br />
i carry two...<br />
<br />
1st for the slower with a /g and /say message just so they KNOW im doing something about the loss/transfer of agro.<br />
and<br />
a 2nd for my cleric with the same kind of message.<br />
i use the cleric for when the fight is going sour to have the mob on me so that i may die with a better chance for the healer to get out.<br />
<br />
you will notice over time that the slowers especially appreciate /shield.  <br />
I try to work out my fight so that i am near the slower before the slow is cast.  this allows me to be in /shield range should the slow fizzle or agro gets transfered.<br />
<br />
If you use Taunt correctly (ie dont always hit it on refresh), you will notice that /shield will at least give you another oppurtunity to get a taunt off.<br />
<br />
Use it...use it a lot...your casters will love you for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goradain</div><div class="date">03-08-2004, 02:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have one for the slower.  I used to have one for the Cleric/Druid, but they rarely seem to get aggro, so I dropped them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frig Coldheart</div><div class="date">03-08-2004, 04:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I will also set up a /shield hotkey for the MA on raids or against tougher mobs incase it looks like a heal might be a little late. You can help with that extra couple seconds needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chumchum</div><div class="date">03-08-2004, 07:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know this is something you wouldn't ordinary do, but can you have multiple warriors /shield the same person?  I mean if you have 2 warrior shielding the same person, will that person receive 1/4 of dmg instead of 1/2 of dmg?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mokor Leadheaad</div><div class="date">03-08-2004, 09:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1 shield at a time and neither can be useing a disc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ejryu</div><div class="date">03-09-2004, 02:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So /shield is a disc, right?  Therefore, the theory of warrior_01 tanking, warrior_02 shielding warrior_01, and warrior_03 shielding warrior_02 is not possible, huh?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">03-09-2004, 03:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i recently found a guild that actually lists Living Shield 3 as one of their required AAs for warriors.  This one confused me.  While it has it's uses in groups, I can't see the AA time extension being all that useful and I can't see /shield being very useful against raid mobs, period.  <br />
<br />
It a situation where /shield might be useful, I can't imagine someone needing more than 12 seconds or so of shielding.  If they still have aggro after that, either they're dead, I'm dead, or we're both/all dead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">03-09-2004, 04:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can see the rationale.  Shield is better than defensive for the person receiving it, and not much worse than defensive for the warrior that's doing it.<br />
<br />
A fully slowed mob only swings twice in 12 seconds.  With you diverting half of the damage, and the other person having CA3/LR5, it is easily possible for the other person to survive much longer than 12 seconds, even on mobs that hit for 1300+. <br />
<br />
Taunt does not work very well in SolRo and later zones.  Having shield last for 24 seconds is a huge help I've found, and I can see a definite reason to further extend the timer.  Often the 24 second shield wears out before I can get aggro under control.<br />
<br />
With shield effects running 1/4 of the time (48 seconds per 180 seconds), each warrior could preemptively shield someone who tends to draw aggro, before it even happens.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azaza</div><div class="date">03-09-2004, 11:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">2 additional things:<br />
<br />
- As the range of /shield is pretty damn small, keep your slower (or whomever you plan to have it hotkeyed for) within 25 feet (or melee range) of you. Make sure they don't go running off either if they get hit (namely casters *sigh*)<br />
<br />
and, <br />
<br />
- While I can't say how much aggro it'll offer, /shield does appear to give you some and can help you pull the mob off the other person. But don't expect it to pull the mob off all by itself, especially when the mob is going after the player with low health aggro....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Froggerx Xreggorf</div><div class="date">03-10-2004, 12:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Make a hotkey that reads this:<br />
<br />
<br />
line1:     /assist<br />
line2:     /pause 2<br />
line3:     /shield<br />
line4:     /pause 2<br />
line5:     /assist<br />
<br />
<br />
Basically if you lose aggro in a group (on pulls or what have you) just flick your hotkey, it'll shield whomever the mobs on then set you back to attacking the main mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">03-10-2004, 01:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A PoP or GoD mob that hits for 1300 max is nothing.  Think high end raid mobs though, Sassinak.  What are you going to do, set up a heal chain on the MT and the /shield warrior?  If you don't, the shielding warrior will be dead very quickly anyway.  You're not going to need extended time.  I doubt a raid guild cares whether you have /shield AAs for your grind groups.  I suppose it might be a small issue for single group trials in GoD that the guild needs to complete to advance, but that's it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">03-10-2004, 03:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am not sure what your point is, Callon.  You said it yourself.  This is not a skill for fighting boss mobs.  This is for trash, adds, minis, and trials.  A GoD trial is probably the ideal place for it.<br />
<br />
A guild that cares only about 20 minutes of afk-auto-attack on Aten Ha Ra probably doesn't care.  But a guild that wants to get its membership into Kod'Taz might very well care.<br />
<br />
And yes, I think any healing team that is capable of sustaining a rampage tank on something like RD or Bertox should be perfectly capable of healing a /shield tank too.</div></div><hr />
