<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Malek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Because there is no single other thing in EQ that trivializes the game more than mez.  I hate it.  Having 2-3 tanks in a group and 2-3 mobs each pull is how it should be.  Chaotic.  And I wouldn't mind seeing root gone also.  If you only have 1 tank and you get 3 mobs, leave it to him to hold aggro on all 3, fuck the root parking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yeah yeah .. and heals .. and slows .. and nukes ...<br />
Oh wait, what is left ?<br />
<br />
Mez is good in some situations.<br />
In other situations it's no use .. like when you single pull.<br />
<br />
The thing about all this, is that it adds to the tactical dimension of the game - If all you have is everyone bashes on it all the time, you eventually have a hack&amp;slash only .. like Diablo, noone ever stops and thinks for a moment. The only good thing in that game is damage, damage aaaand ... more damage.'<br />
<br />
I don't wanna play a game that is so single minded.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Squizer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">And not counting that no mez/no root would need totally secure aggro lock for anyone that wants to tank.<br />
<br />
I mean, there's no point having 3 tanks if 2 of them are running after a mob :b</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Unless they are all tankmages in which case ...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Malek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Tactical dimension is pulling all the mobs you want and letting the chanter put all the adds to sleep?<br />
<br />
Aggro lock for all the tanks is hardly necessary.  By the time the slower starts slowing the adds anyone can have enough aggro to hold onto the mob.<br />
<br />
I just don't find ganking one mob at a time too exciting.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you dont find it exciting, then dont mez and dont root *shrugs*<br />
The fact that the tools are there doesnt make you use em, if you dont like em, just charge 3 mobs and keep agro on all of them and avoid the casters getting killed cause when the wizard nuked one of them, you were with your attention on another, or right when the chanter tashed, you were building agro on the first mob and not on the second... but thats your problem to solve, not mine, I prefer to have control and all running smoothly, someone once said that the warrior is the leader of the group, and I dont think any leader wants a chaotic, everyone dying, wasting all the mana on healing everyone situation, sure that when you cant avoid it, its fun to deal with the situation (if you can), but its also fun to keep that 900dmg quadding mob on you while the other 2 are rooted/mezzed and not slaughtering your groupmates.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Malek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">And that Ealsur is why I'm asking if anyone know's of upcoming mmorpgs without mezzing.  I never said EQ should get rid of the spell because it would never happen, the game is structured to rely on mez in too many encounters.  I'm just looking for a game that somewhat resembles a realistic battle, which are by nature chaotic.  /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sylas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">WoW will have minimal CC and will be more of the chaotic AE type battles.  Additionally, i think ever class gets a form of single target CC like rogues can sap, all casters get a stun/root/sleep type thing, warriors can stun etc.  In a fast paced fight where the DPS of players is proportionate to the HPs of mobs, a 10 second stun is just as good a a mez since things die in 10 seconds anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Right,  AFAIK, WoW will be pretty much entirely Damage oriented ... which is pretty one dimensional IMO., but Blizzard has such a good track record that I'm gonna try it out anyways .... once it's on th street at least.</div></div><hr />
