Which would you pick ?   The haste on the Kizrak's isn't that important to me, as I'm usually grouped with a shaman and/or a chanter.  I'm just mainly interested in the saves, and higher AC.  But, losing 30 HP from the Myrmidon's makes me hesitant.</div></div><hr />

The saves suck and the stats are minimal...  Save your money.<br />
<br />
Kizrak's gaunts are only for dueling and pretty sure it doesnt stack with eyepatch of plunder.</div></div><hr />

Nope, Raw HP has always been better than STA.  Especially for those of us who are maxed STA.</div></div><hr />

How many times are you healed with LESS than 30hps remaining?  The added AC is effective all the time in terms of damage mitigation.  The extra 30hps are only effective when you are healed with less than 30hps or comparing gear on magelo's for bragging rights.<br />
<br />
At lvl 59 with your gear you should be fighting mobs that hit for much more than 30 hps.  I am guessing you will be fighting mobs that hit for 200-500ish depending on tier1/2.  I actually wear my kizrak's gloves and banked my Myrmidom ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Personally, I would rather wear Kizrak's or Velium Encrusted over SS gaunts, but you already have SS gaunts. There are other upgrades that will serve you better than what is basically a lateral move rather than an upgrade.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, that's fairly true, but not 100%.  I'm thinking more along the lines of, say during a longer battle, when your cleric(s) start casting a CH just a tick sooner than they would have, had those 30 extra HP kept you above their &quot;Shit I better cast CH now!&quot; mark.  If that happens often enough, it may make the difference of 1 more CH, no ?</div></div><hr />

If you said that to every piece of worn equipment &quot;what's 30hp gunna do for me&quot;  you would be missing out on 600hp.  Of course this is extreme but it all adds up.  Those added stats are usless with shammy buffs or avatar proc, the haste is useless with enchanter haste.  Only thing u benefit from is AC and hp and minor saves.  Whats the old AC vs. HP rule?  (This changed with PoP but still applies imo.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>MillohEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well obviously thats what i was missing, being a low stamina warrior, I forget about the whole max stamina issue.  I see what ya mean now tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">nothing i would worry about if i already had ss. i dunno where they drop, u can probably camp them, if they give you more hps then they are the better item till you max sta. such a minor upgrade though, just not something to worry about. ss gloves are the best drop in HoT, didnt replace them till raex.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Wulfran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I agree with others that say this is pretty much a wash and not worth a) spending a lot of plat on or b) spending your DKPs or whatever type of &quot;loot credit&quot; you have with your raiding force.<br />
<br />
I have Myrmidon gaunts and have discarded the idea of getting Kizrak's. I usually go by the 1 AC = 6 hp rule (forget where I read it the first time but...) so 6 AC would equal 36 hp in my figuring, so not enough improvement to get too hyped about. I've got more important upgrades to get myself...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kyryll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I banked my SS gaunts.<br />
<br />
But then again, I do a lot of 2 boxing with my 60 druid. There's no haste there, and I didn't have the eyepatch of plunder. To me, it was a HUGE upgrade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sarcazzm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">i'm keeping my SS gauntlets. Sta will be maxed with raid buffs so keep the raw hps, the haste doesnt stack and does not include the supposed 50+sta like allakhazam once said so just keep the SS gloves~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Borix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">If you are able to get Kizrak's Gauntlets (I hope you don't buy them), then it wouldn't be to difficult to get the Gloves of Stability of Lendiniara the Keeper in WToV.<br />

<br />
They beat Kizrak's (except for the proc) and the 15 HP they have less than the SS gaunts are compensated by 8 AC and resist stats.<br />

PS. This is a typical item that should have at least been plate class only.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Wompem Ondahed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I have passed on 2 Ornate Gauntlet Molds so far because they better fit my cleric ( wife ) and bard ( friend ). It is hard to see the mitigation due to higher AC when they are very similar even though I know there is in theory. I will loot a pair when I am the only one without them, or in a greed group. The effect is very useful for duoing with the wife I will admit.<br />
<br />
I gotta say this though, tonight I was healed for 7302 hps when I only had 7329 hps ( group buffed ). So, 27 hps DID make a visible difference this time. I have been in the purple club 3 times ( adds suck ) over the course of my warrior's life, so I am thankful for any hitpoints I get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Cyphan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I would rather have Velium Encrusted than the Kizraks personally but the Kizraks are cheaper and only have slightlty lower stats than the Encrusted Gaunts. With that said I bought and then quickly tried to sell the Velium Encrusted Gaunts. Sure I was happy with the added saves and AC but it wasnt worth losing 30hps along with other better upgrades for the money. Maybe at some point Ill go and get the Encrusted gaunts but for now theres better upgrades for the money.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Bulbog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I use my kizrak gaunts and just bag them when I'm on raids or have a shaman in group to max my sta then swap in the SS gaunts.  Nice for when there's no shaman though, extra 20hp or so and better AC, then use the clicky for soloing/factioning/farming greens.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Crystara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">No reason not to carry around a set of Kizrak's Gauntlets if you can afford them, a 70 min 30% haste buff comes in handy plenty of times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Dima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Ya. Take both. SS for normal usage and Kizrak for clickie clickie</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Sarelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Ditto, use both. <br />
<br />
My own stamina is not quite maxed without buffs so when I duo with my Druid I only lose 5hp and gain 10ac and stats with Kizraks over SS and the 30% haste is a god send. In a proper group the Kizrak's just get bagged.</div></div><hr />
