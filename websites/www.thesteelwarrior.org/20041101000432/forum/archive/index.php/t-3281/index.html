First buy the aug, then imbue it on weapon then put weapon in bag, then buy another one and imbue it. Then you can equip both at the same time. So ther eyou can get for example 2 1h with same proc, the only thing tho is that when you loot your corpse and you have the weapons equiped you have to loot 1, then put in bag then loot the other one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Timmok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You risk losing the points spent on the aug though if they at some point decide to fix the bag-before-loot &quot;feature&quot;(thus you would have to remove the aug).</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're saying that if I had two of the same weapons, I could put the same augment on both of them..?<br />
<br />
How many people wield identical weapons?<br />
<br />
If you meant that you have, say, a Frostbringer and a Snowchipper and you have to go through all this trouble to put Anger 1 on both of them, that kinda stinks, but thanks for the info.</div></div><hr />
