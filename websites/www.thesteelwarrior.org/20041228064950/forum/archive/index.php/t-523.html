<br />
also say i have around 10k and i want to start doing the rings . i have my lvl 65 wizzy (very good will all pop spells and hundreds of aa) to 2box . with these 2 resoarces and not spending to much time camping how far in the series do you think i could get before running out of cash or neding more than 2 weeks?<br />
<br />
i know for ring 8 or 9 there are a few MQ shrtcuts but im mostly thinking on just focusing on the first 5-7 rings as im guildless andnot ready to devote huge amounts of time</div></div><hr />

The quest decriptions are fairly decent and fit nicely on a couple of pages if you cut and paste them into notebook or wordpad.  I have obtained rings 1-7 with them, haven't tried doing the others yet so can't comment on the accuracy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Friedrick</div><div class="date">05-08-2003, 09:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did rings 1-8 in a weekend at lvl 63.  I sometimes had the help of a 58 cleric and or a 61 bard.  A bard is invaluable in this endeavor because of many of the shortcuts they can use.  On ring 6 or 7 iirc you have to escort a dwarf through EW from the prison to a coldain camp.  You start the walk and when the mobs spawn that will attack the Dwarf, you have bard aggro dwarf, pull out around mobs to just outside coldain camp, charm him, camp out, and avoid the fight altogether.  Otherwise you need a group or so to actually do the fight.  Wiz you are speaking of could solo the fights I am sure, just have to do it fairly fast and without AE's or risk killing the dwarf.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomb</div><div class="date">05-08-2003, 10:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did ring 1 to 9 in 2 and a half days with either my cleric or my 53 druid on second computer.<br />
Only had 2 fights where i had help, that was barradain for 9th ring when the brewer helped me although it wasnt really needed and for the kael part of the 9th ring (i had the head already but needed to clear the plate house to spawn doldigun for hand in).<br />
I'd say you can probably do most of it with a high level druid partner.<br />
Peffin isnt easy (in the giant fort in EW).<br />
I used wake of tranquility on the rooted giants and engaged peffin with a 2hander.<br />
Cleric didnt get agro although he was using Complete heal after one or two supernal elixiers.<br />
After peffin died cleric gated and i ran for zone after looting head.<br />
War can be done with a bard or druid partner by harmonying the chief group in fort and single pulling him.<br />
Kill him, invis out and hand in head.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gaylon</div><div class="date">05-09-2003, 09:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did Rings 1-7 With my very good Druid partner in one afternoon.  Really was pretty easy.  She did all the tradeskill items and MQ them for me.  I used the Ring guides on the Monklybusiness boards.  Basically they are guides on how a monk can solo rings 1-7.  So whereever it says, &quot;Have Monk FD&quot; replace that with &quot;Have Druid Egress&quot; and your gtg :)<br />
<br />
Did the 8th ring with the Druid and a 58 Ranger friend.<br />
<br />
<br />
I am curious how far into the 9th Ring I can get with just my Druid friend?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomb</div><div class="date">05-09-2003, 10:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd say you should be able to duo the first traitor in GD together with your druid.<br />
Have druid harmony room and pull him out.<br />
Next is Captain baradain, after handing him the tainted avalanche ale you can use same tactic (harmony pull).<br />
For Peffin you will definitely need help.<br />
I could pull it off with a cleric partner but barely.<br />
5 rooted elites all in hitting range when you engage peffin are a lot of trouble. <br />
Wake of tranquility can keep them off you for a bit but i had like 7120 or so hp with gaudralek and was using riposte disc on engage so it helped tons.<br />
The low agro supernal elixier of my cleric prevented him being summoned by the giants(i am not 100 percent positive they summon at all).<br />
A group should be all you need to make this safe.<br />
The kael traitor needs a bit more work, i had a 61 chanter with dc pet, another warrior (level 59), a 61 ranger and my two characters trigger the dwarf.<br />
I would  not have needed to finish it as i already had the head and only needed ring.<br />
But was a nice challenge for a small group with rather low dps.<br />
Last traitor in icewell keep can be duod again.</div></div><hr />
