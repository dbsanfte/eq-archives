all sound good but forget having a full suit of crust since you'll need dex to make weapons proc. i've found that 125+ dex means good proc rates. you'll have to mix and match stuff.<br />
<br />
add cobalt boots (25ac) that drop in KC and ya have a 25 str byff and even withought someone around to buff ya:P<br />
<br />
DO NOT get weapoms that proc AoE. <br />
<br />
look around at what other warriors have and check allakhzam and drool over some of the sweet weapons and armor you'll see lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Is Guts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">As Xarim said your magelo is the biggest help to give people an idea where you are upto, plus a rough idea of funds you have available for 'off the shelf' bazaar upgrades. <br />
<br />
One upgrade I aways wish I had botherd with earlier a snare whip, think all new warrior's should get one at creation :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dearlic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">This is probably a stupid question but how do I post on magelo?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Wolfron Donuts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Dearlic,<br />
<br />
Take a wander over to http://www.magelo.com and sign up for an account, then start creating characters from there. Fun stuff!<br />
<br />
Salute,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Raunstonecutter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Plate cycle in Kael is good.  HoT when you get 55 if your guild is still there.  If not, spend some time in LDoN, particularly (sp?) the tak one, as it seems to have some of the best hp/ac armor.  As far as weapons, Frostbringer and Defenders light blade would be a good combo of agro proc and DPS.  Or if you are a stickler for watning a hate proc, I have a Barnicaled Covered Axe on my mule in the bazaar I would be more than willing to hand off to you.  Drop me a tell sometime if you want it.</div></div><hr />
