<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gyzz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I recently procured an account with a 52 cleric from a friend, and I decided to try my hand at 2-Boxing with my warrior.  Does anyone have suggestions on where I should try to practice 2-boxing where I could still get decent exp gain for both characters?  <br />
<br />
The cleric is a DE, and I do have the snare necklace, so that should make things a bit easier.  Also, I have a ToD in my bag o' tricks to handle slows, if need be.<br />
<br />
I was able to handle the first 2 boats in Dulak, but it got a bit dicey at times during respawns.  I'm not overly concerned about getting loot, but I certainly wouldn't frown on it either.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?<br />
<br />
-Gyzz</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Near the entrance to SeB is probably doable, PoJ should be a good duo spot too, especially with some form of slow.  (ToD can be unreliable at times though)<br />
Some stuff in FG, BW, Velks, Sol B, probably some DB stuff in LGuk, KC, Aviak Island in OOT if you're careful pulling, Ice Giants outside and inside permafrost.....that's about all that comes readily to mind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Anywhere is pretty much duoable if you have the mana and hp to stay alive. I'd recommend PoJ, buy some dmg shield potions and forget about slowing. If PoJ isn't yeilding much xp then goto PoI, the robots are usually single pullable and don't hit for much (~250).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'd give velektors a go. Easily reachable and easy cr. XP should be very decent for 2 boxing at your level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I recommend trying Karnor's castle undead.<br />
<br />
As your cleric levels up through the 50's, it will get tons of handy utility spells, which will help your duo considerably.  You would do well to gradually shift your main focus in the duo to the cleric as you obtain more of these tools.<br />
<br />
Wake of Tranquility lets your cleric single pull almost anything below level 60.  Very low resist rate.  This spell makes your cleric the puller.<br />
<br />
Yaulp IV allows you to regen mana while standing and while casting those long CH spells.  You should never have problems with sitting aggro ever again after you have this spell.<br />
<br />
MoR makes quite a difference when you first get it.  It noticeably shortens fights.  MoK is less dramatic, but you may still notice its benefit if you have fast weapons.<br />
<br />
Hammer pet and summoned proc hammer combined with Yaulp 4/5 will add at least 25 DPS to your duo.  Quite useful when plowing through blues of low-medium difficulty.<br />
<br />
Hammer pet is your most reliable way to break root.  Cast it whenever you want to reel in a mob that you've root-parked.<br />
<br />
Blessed Armor of the Risen will help solve your downtime for the cleric.  This spell + Yaulp 5 = KEI mana regen while standing.<br />
<br />
Celestial Elixir will change the way you approach healing.  Much more useful than the level 44 version, it can be actually more efficient than CH if your hit points and efficiency are not top notch.<br />
<br />
Never forget the Atone spell.  It does get resisted a lot at these levels, but it can save your cleric's butt if you have aggro management issues within your duo.  If a pull can be rooted, then it can be aborted using atone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Karnors would be tough at 59 with his gear/AA cause you almost always get 2 mobs and they are are in their 50s. Also forget about medding with undead around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Scruppy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Try velks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I ground through levels 58-60 in Karnor's castle during early Velious, camping the hand room by myself with a Hate-equipped 53 cleric 2-box.  Gyzz has almost identical equipment as I had at the time, but better weapons, and his cleric has a better spell lineup available today.  He'd clean up there.  At least 2/3 of my pulls from the basement were singles using simple proximity aggro.  At level 59 I got bolder and did occasional bodyguard pulls.  I would root-park extra hands and named mobs, but I never bothered to park trash mobs, which were trivial to tank in pairs and trios, even in those days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Sassinak I am very skeptical about you breaking hand room by yourself, 2 boxing cleric, in early velious era with under 3k hp, no aa, no ft, no kei and shit for dps and also pulling basement and bodyguards before respawns. Groups back then were bareley able to do that and then only the good ones.<br />
<br />
Regardless, I dont consider it a good spot for a beginer two boxer of his gear character. Veleks is probably the only place I'd really recomend because you can set up by zi and practice almost risk free. Sol B, ldc camp would be second but its harder to get to and cr could be a bitch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Buuhmann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">if you feel you need to train ur boxing skills a bit and / or want very easy (but kinda slow) exp, go velks. you can single pull pretty much everything at spiders and kobolds at lvl 59 / 60. You should be able to kill multiple spiders at once without any downtime. MoR, ring8 DS and a decend 2 hander can increase your dps output in that case.<br />
<br />
For better exp you could try tier1 pop zones. PoN zonein or PoD trash should be doable, just find some save spot at the zoneline. However you will need KEI then and prolly will get downtimes.  With your gear you also should try to slow the mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gyzz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">My Magelo's is a little outdated.  I grabbed a Fabled Mith 2h right after the fabled mobs were introduced.  That increased my damage output by a pretty noticeable amount.  <br />
<br />
These are all really good suggestions.  I'll give a couple of these places a try over the weekend and let you guys know how it went.<br />
<br />
-Gyzz</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Zynth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">when i did karnors (years ago) most of it single pulled at 55. velks would probably be better exp depending on how crouded it is on your server. veksar entrance might be doable for you. the best exp for your set up will most likly come from zones where you can easily single pull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">when i did karnors (years ago) most of it single pulled at 55 <br />
<br />
  Pfft, the goal of pulling in KC was to train everything to the enterence and make everyone zone out. Single pulling is for wimps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Muurlat McKrom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">i personally ghetto box and i enjoy it alot better than 2 differant screens and kb.<br />
<br />
i am able to xp anywhere and raid/tank for my guild as my warrior and be in the ch order with the cleric. its very fun but you got to have your timing down well and have a pretty rocking machine to pull it off.</div></div><hr />

/unquote<br />
<br />
Speaking as someone who's leveled a cleric to 65, NONE of the yaulps begin regening your mana until level 56 when you get Yaulp 5.  Yaulp 4 only boosts your str and atk ratings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Knord</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Once the fabled stuff is over I'd suggest Sol B, either champ/king room or BnB.  Both would not be horribly hard at yours and her level, and should be decent xp for both.  I did champ/king while PLing my dual box cleric up to 43, used my 51 twink Iksar war to do it, he has about the same stats as you do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I would also suggest Velks, usually not to crowded anymore either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">at 59 solB is green except soome bat/bugs  and of course imps/giants.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Shredder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I prefer KC over SolB.<br />
<br />
Usually the only people you see in the zone now days are people farming VS/VSR.<br />
<br />
<br />
The mobs tend to have low MR.  Cleric MR nukes often land for full, and root lasts a good long while.  Low HP on mobs, and they don't hit overly fast or hard.  Undead nukes and the undead dot works fairly well too.  And best of all, you can use a horse with the cleric.  Improved dmg 3/4 can also be quite handy.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you don't mind losing Coldain faction, the dwarf guards in the velium mine in GD aren't bad XP either.  Just be mindful of Korf.  He summons.<br />
<br />
Might also want to try Icewell Keep if faction isn't a concern.</div></div><hr />

My mistake, I was indeed referring to the level 56 version.  My goal was to describe the useful spells that are obtained around the 54-58 range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Gyzz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Well, I tried a few different locales over the weekend.  First, I did give KC a try and that went pretty well.  I only wiped once due to a wanderer, but I was able to DA with my cleric and run to the zone.  The exp wasn't great, but it was pretty steady.<br />
<br />
Also, I tried my hand at PoJ pulling guards, rats &amp; prisoners.  The exp seemed to be better for my cleric, so for the time being I may make that my spot.  With KEI mana was never an issue.  I even gave the cleric my CHoS and let him melee a bit.<br />
<br />
All in all it was pretty challenging, considering I ghetto 2-box using 1 computer (and a slow one, at that).  Again, I appreciate all of the suggestions and I may try some of the other suggested spots in the next week or so.<br />
<br />
-Gyzz</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">When I was your level with my warrior/cleric I did the PoJ zone-out a ton.  I would set up there and usually people would join me as time progressed.  With warrior/cleric any dps people you can add to your group will improve your exp significantly.  Won't be great exp for your warrior at 59, but it will help your cleric get caught up, and you're not gonna do PoV or anything with your gear/levels.  You could try the zone-in to Innovation, but I think you will find that stuff hits harder and has much more hps, so the killing will be slow and you may have downtime.  If you get a good group together at PoJ entrance you could consider moving them over to Innovation.  <br />
<br />
If the PoJ zone-out gets easy, try the Mavuin hall.  Almost everything is low enough to pacify with the level 39 spell, nothing runs, and you will get nice gems and ethereal parchments that your cleric will need.  If you get to the point where you can clear the hall you can make around 1k or more an hour in gems, and my cleric had a full set of ethereal spells by the time he was 61.  Watch out for the trap in the left corner....I tended to ignore it, but then after a while you get 6 or 8 of those things stacked up over there and get too close it's not pretty.  Probably best to just kill them as they pop but they are lower level and not as good exp or loot as the normal mobs there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Shredder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I even gave the cleric my CHoS and let him melee a bit. <br />
<br />
Try the Hammer of Judgement line.  The ratio is better, and the proc rate is drastically higher than the CHoS.  Best of all, it's unresistable.  :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
His cleric is only 52 :)  I think the first proccing hammer is level 55.  I was gonna post the same thing and then remembered that a level 52 cleric's summoned hammer doesn't proc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>zito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">A sort of related question.  Which would be your vote for the best 2-boxing partner for a warrior; a cleric, or a shaman ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Gyzz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">From my (obviously) limited experience, I would have to say that a Shaman would probably be a better partner.  If DRo is anything like Povar, you can pick up a Virtue pretty much any time of day in PoK, so that negates your need for cleric buffs.  <br />
<br />
With Shaman buffs, slow, debuffs, haste, DoT's for extra DPS and Regen, it just seems like there's a lot more utility.  All my cleric does, for the most part is heal and nuke.  Pacify does make pulling much easier, and having a built-in rezzer is always nice.  However, those two things just don't seem to measure up to what a Shaman can do.<br />
<br />
That being said, Shaman have the least healing power of all the priest classes, so that may limit where you can 2-box.  At least until 58 when the Shaman gets Tnarg's.<br />
<br />
I've never 2-boxed a shaman, but I've partnered with them plenty of times.  I'm sure someone who has actually played the Shaman/Warrior combo could be a bit more insightful.<br />

<br />
Friend of mine can do a ton more stuff with a shaman than I can with a cleric.  70% slow is all powerful.  Easily brings a lot more mobs down to the healing capabilities of the shaman, than what the clerics mana pool can survive on a lot of those mobs unslowed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Knord</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Three letters:  ToD<br />
<br />
Not quite as good (or reliable) as a shammy, but it has allowed me to effectively duo Comm 1 and Comm 2 camps in Ssra without any need for a med break using my cleric.  Sure, the named take a while to kill with only the cleric hammer and an occasional nuke, but my limitations are not due to lack of slow at all.  The *real* reason to use a shammy over a cleric is because of the dismal DPS of a cleric/war combo.  Course, it could also be because I have yet to do any DPS AAs that I have this problem....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">At 65 war/shm is probably a more powerful combination, although a ToD can really level the playing field assuming it procs.  For leveling up, you will do better with a cleric.  Shamans healing power is way below that of a cleric, and if your shaman is trying to slow and do all the healing they won't be able to keep up with mana until they get Quiessence and Cani V and their big heals.  I tried leveling up with a shaman and we just had too much downtime.  Cleric was much better in the 40-60 levels.  And res is very handy of course.  MoR is nice as well, although that's a high-level thing.  A cleric is also easier to 2-box.  In a single-pull situation you can pretty much get them down to 1 button (/tar tank /sit off /cast CH).  I usually get mine up and melee with the hammer o' doom if he's got the mana though.  Shaman can theoretically do more dps, but unless they're 65 and well AA'd they're not going to have mana to slow, heal, and dot much.<br />
<br />
Find a beastlord to group with your warrior/cleric and you have an uber trio :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">personally I dont like 2 boxing cleric<br />
I leveled mine to 49 and once he got CH and was able to start grouping for xp with my war it was too damn easy and utility compared to druid was lacking too much. I just couldnt go on without my ds/snare/evac/charm and ofcourse clicky dps.<br />
<br />
If you like to focus on playing warrior and dont want to do much on 2nd toon then cleric is hands down way to go. On other hand if you want more of a chalenge and have utility pick shamy or unconventional druid :) I must warn ya thought war/druid combo kinda sucks till they get CH at 58.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>zito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Thanks for all the replies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Kendolekk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">PoD flies. All I have to say.<br />
<br />
I did this after hitting 60 myself. Gear was underpar and I was having a little trouble handling Pov.<br />
<br />
Acquired a gimpy 52 cleric, and grouped with him and solo killed PoD flies, right near zone in. Single pullable, low HP, handleable DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Gothmaug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Unless your shaman has good gear (hp/AC), be ready to get whacked a couple of times once you cast slow or your first DOT.  Those spells generate a lot of agro.  With good agro gear on your warrior, it might not be an issue.  With my warrior, it is unless I get a lucky early proc.<br />
<br />
That being said, I have both a cleric and shaman on my 2nd account, and enjoy the shaman more.  The extra dps is nice, as is haste/slow.  The level 58 complete heal kind of sucks, but it will fill the gap.  At 60, you get torpor to heal during downtime (it slows the target, so don't use it during fights) and at 62 you get a decent blast heal that does about 1500? hp base.  With improved healing and AAs, it's a decent quick heal.<br />
<br />
Gothmaug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I have to disagree with Casai's assessment.  Yes, a 49 cleric is boring and just a healbot... if you don't use pacify or atone to manage your pulling.  A 59 cleric on the other hand is a much more versatile tool, and can also outdamage a 59 warrior.  Clerics get tons of duo-friendly tools in the mid-50's, and yes, that includes clicky DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">are you saying cleric utlity &gt; druid/shaman?<br />
other then rez/pacify the utility pretty much ends. Other priests get pets/charms for manaless dmg, travel enchantments like sow and invis, harmony, haste, well a ton. Dont get me wrong I am not bashing cleric, I just want to say that if you want utility cleric is not the way to go. Cleric is the warrior of priest class. They good at one thing, which is healing, just as warriors and tanking. War/cleric combo is very powerfull, but lacking versatility.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">All I am saying is that a level 60+ cleric can and should be doing a hell of a lot more than healing in a duo.  The smaller a group, the larger a role that a cleric fulfills.  A cleric can match and sustain the DPS of an average self-hasted warrior pre-elementals.  While they lack evacuate and invis, clerics are one of the most powerful classes for preventing and shedding aggro.  A cleric 2-box can take a very active role, as active as a druid 2-box, where the warrior is just autopilot DPS either way.</div></div><hr />
