<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Uganok</div><div class="date">11-01-2004, 04:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I recently began playing EverQuest again after a two year hiatus and started up an Ogre Warrior.  I've reached 54 and realize that I really need to increase my AC.  But being an ogre of limited means I've only managed to save up about 5k.  My biggest need is a new chest piece as my current one at AC 18 just isn't cutting it.  So I've been looking around in the bazaar and the two with the best AC that are also in my price range (remotely) are the Wind-worn Chestplate (http://www.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=17383) for 9-10k and the Architect's Bejewelled Chestplate (http://www.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=23154) for 4-5k.  WW has better stats but fewer HP than ABC.  Should I go ahead and buy the ABC or keep saving?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your advice! :)<br />

The CHA on WW does make a difference but not at your level. Don't wait, you need the upgrade now, buy the ABC.</div></div><hr />

Trying to look around on Allakhazam and figure out what GSoT is in the chest armor slot.  Could you please elaborate?  (I'm still new.)<br />
<br />
Also, aggro weapons are on my shopping list.  :)<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

<br />
It's an aggro weapon 31/30 2hb with a stun proc.  Required level of 55 and very damn cheap yet very very good.<br />
<br />
I agree with the 2nd poster ... ABC is the way to go for a cheap, strong breastplate.</div></div><hr />

Not a bad deal at all for 54 AC I didn't think.  Jumped my overall AC something like 41 I think.  Woo hoo!<br />
<br />
Thanks for the advice!  :D<br />
