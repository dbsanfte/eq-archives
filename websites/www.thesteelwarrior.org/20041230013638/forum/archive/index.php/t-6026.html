<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zowmaster</div><div class="date">03-05-2004, 10:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey I basically got two things about HP i want to get clear:<br />
<br />
1) I always hear everybody say level to 65 then work on AA's, but if your base STA determines the amount of HP you get in a level, why not start working on Innate STA at 51 to max to get most HP as possible?<br />
<br />
2) Does anybody know how much HP you get for 1 STA point?  I always thought it was two, but i just found out that my 41 Orge gets 3.6 HP's per STA point.  Is there a chart or anything that tells how much HP you get per STA point as you progess through the levels?<br />
<br />
Any help in these question would be greatly appreciated thanx :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goradain</div><div class="date">03-05-2004, 10:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The reason everyone says to get 65 first is when you go /lfg all anyone sees is level 65 War LFG.  They don't see &quot;55 War w/ CA3, CS3, 7kHP buffed, etc&quot;.<br />
<br />
That and getting to at least 62 will get you into much better XP zones and you will AA faster at higher levels anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zowmaster</div><div class="date">03-05-2004, 10:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think your getting my point about the first question.  All I'm saying is why not get your STA AA's maxed, so when you are 65 the 5 points you spent at 51 well be like maybe 50-100 HP.  I'm not saying to get every AA u can possibly get, just get the STA AA's to increase your base STA so you can get more HP from 51-65.  If anybody can tell me why this is a bad idea or would not work the way i'm describing it would be greatly appreciated. Thanx :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wulfran</div><div class="date">03-05-2004, 11:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sta AAs are wasted points once you get to a certain level of gear and its not too far. I started capping my buffed stamina well before ornate, although I was able to use 1 of the top 2 culturals (helanic tundra). Those points will serve you better in other places.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dafrog</div><div class="date">03-05-2004, 11:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Stats are easily buffed to max. As it stands now I am 304 stamina unbuffed due to equipment.<br />
<br />
At lower levels this max will not likely be achieved, but buffs sure help alot.<br />
<br />
Your situation you may benefit by putting points in stamina if you aren't maxxed with buffs, and you may be in the lower levels for lengthy periods of time. For me though, i sacrificed the temporary utility I would have gained from having stamina aa's maxxed for aa's that work regardless if I am buffed to max or if my equipment does it...more specifically run3 and regen.<br />
<br />
Other advantage of not working on AA at lower levels is the fact that your utility for a greater level exceeds AA's. You tank better at 65, you hit better at 65. You probably have more hps at 65 anyhow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Amadayo</div><div class="date">03-05-2004, 12:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is the real answer to your question. Forgive these other warrior they are too high and mighty to see you simple question at all :-).<br />
<br />
You dont get perminent HP for your STA bonus[s] as you level. Suppose, if you have 100 sta at level 50 and when you get to level 65 you have 255 sta; Then you wont have less base hp than if you had had 255 Sta at level 50. <br />
<br />
you will gain the same amound of &quot;base&quot; hp per ding regardless.<br />
<br />
<br />
hope this helps!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caldron</div><div class="date">03-05-2004, 12:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think it boils down to the very simple thought of knowing for a fact it takes forever to get an AA at the lower levels. My Druid did AA at lower levels and even mixed experiance and AA and it took forever. (insert note here was learning)<br />
<br />
I have learned and getting the levels is goal 1. Look at the threads in the bunker about armor upgrades and such. Most people are not in Uber guilds so they cannot go get the great armor. Nor do they have high level bots laying around to go farm for them therefore, LDoN is a big thing to us warriors to get some dang good armor but it takes tons of points. Knowing I have been doing LDoN's since they came out with my warrior who was like 30 when they came out look look i am only 54 now and have no where near 1400 points to be able to max out one LDoN area. I have done LDoN's with my 65 Druid and get many more points with him than my 54 warrior. (insert thought that I agree with this disparity even if it sucks) <br />
<br />
Rules<br />
1. Get your Levels and get your AA next. <br />
2. Read Rule 1 Again<br />
3. Caveat if you always have a group at will then play as you like <br />
<br />
Rule 3 is sticky as I have my wife and her cleric but Douing Sucks compared to grouping at this level. <br />
<br />
Sorry this is a novel but just wanted to share what I have learned trolling the boards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jakle Attakle</div><div class="date">03-05-2004, 12:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, the warriors here aren't high and mighty. Nor are they ignorant.<br />
<br />
You want the entire answer?<br />
<br />
You gain levels for every single 2.5 AA or so even in the 60's. I assume it is even faster in your 50's.<br />
<br />
So for the whopping benefit of the 12 hps you would have gotten for that innate STA 2 you have achieved, you could have been gaining a level.<br />
<br />
By doing so, you would gain more than 12 hps, more power, a new discipline, Better ability to resist spells due to level, get closer to new AA's, get closer to accessing BETTER exp zones...<br />
<br />
In addition, due to the advent of 6 stamina augs and current gear, etc...Getting to your max Stamina becomes amazingly easy as you level up. <br />
<br />
Gonna excuse Amadayo as I assume based on his verbage that english is not his first language, but your question could have been easily checked with a couple searches on the topic.<br />
<br />
Hopefully that helps you cement your resolve as to what to do. No one is going to be passing judgement on you or spying on your AA's, so do whatever makes you happiest.<br />
<br />
But in terms of pure, raw advancement of your character, those 2 Stamina AA are wasted. In fact they are wasted vs. about 20-30 other AA choices you will be able to make down the line. <br />
<br />
They are wasted until just about every other Defensive and hp AA have been completed. By the time you get high enough to get all those AA's, you probably won't need innate Stamina.<br />

EDIT - LOL egg on my face. Guess Ama was right. I will leave this here for Posterity to laugh at me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neksnappa</div><div class="date">03-05-2004, 01:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What the original poster probably meant, and what Amad tried to answer was this: Lets say you were level 50 with 100 stamina, and before dinging 51, you grind out a few levels of stamina AA, and then ding 51. You gain like 40 hp, and keep grinding normal exp until you hit level 65, and you'd end up with... 4200 hp or so.<br />
<br />
Now let's say you have 100 stamina at level 50, and ding 51, you might gain like 35 hp. If you stay at 100 stam all the way to 65, lets say your total would be 4000. You then grind out some Stamina AAs, increasing your hp to say 4200.<br />
<br />
Either way, whether you grind stam/hp AA and then level to 65, or grind 65 first and then work on stam/hp AA, you'll end up with the same number of hp in the end. So rather than do AA first, it's considered better to get 65 so you look more appealing to groups in need of a tank, rather than being level 60, with 12 AAs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goradain</div><div class="date">03-05-2004, 02:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, I didn't misunderstand the question.  You asked why not get STA AAs at 51.  I told you why not.  You asked why it was a bad idea.  It's a bad idea for the reasons I posted.<br />
<br />
As for why you don't need Innate STA at all, that's a different question.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BlckMg</div><div class="date">03-05-2004, 02:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, Amad pretty much hit it on the head. The original question was:<br />
&quot;if your base STA determines the amount of HP you get in a level, why not start working on Innate STA at 51 to max to get most HP as possible?&quot;<br />
The answer is, base STA does not determine the amount of HP you get in a level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cyprex</div><div class="date">03-05-2004, 03:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Grats BlckMg, it only took 11 posts for some one to answer the question. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goradain</div><div class="date">03-05-2004, 03:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow, I did miss the hidden meaning in that statement.  What an odd question.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caldron</div><div class="date">03-05-2004, 04:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OUch So did I miss it totally :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zowmaster</div><div class="date">03-05-2004, 06:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanx guys didn't know that base STA didn't determine the HP's you got for next level.  Anybody know what does?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">03-05-2004, 07:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Your level determines how many hit points you get per point of stamina.  But it doesn't matter where those points of stamina come from: buffs, equipment, bardsongs, character creation points, AA's, etc.  There is nothing special about &quot;base&quot; stamina versus &quot;fully buffed&quot; stamina.  Save your AAXP for things that you cannot obtain through equipment or buffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">03-05-2004, 07:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">being a warrior you get more hp per level than any other class. That's the only modifier.<br />
<br />
Hence why an ogre and woodelf both level 65 with identical gear and maxed stats have the same hp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Malikae</div><div class="date">03-05-2004, 09:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I always hear everybody say level to 65 then work on AA's, but if your base STA determines the amount of HP you get in a level, why not start working on Innate STA at 51 to max to get most HP as possible? <br />
<br />
Simple. Why spend a week at level 51 just for one AA, when you can spend 1.5 - 2 hours at level 65 to get one AA. Getting anything besides run 3 before 60 is a waste of time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baxter</div><div class="date">03-07-2004, 07:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You are referring to an idea present in D&amp;D type games that does not exist in Everquest.  When you level, there isn't a &quot;roll&quot; to determine your new HP, only a raw formula that takes your level and your sta.  It was answered earlier, too, but again, there is no way in EQ for two characters of the same level/gear/aa's to have different HP because there is no dynamic allocation like there is in D&amp;D.</div></div><hr />
