<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>unclebong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone here playing AO these days?<br />
<br />
I picked it up a lil whlie back after canceling my EQ subscription.  I know AO sucked at first but coming from EQ I'm loving it so far.  I'm not too into comic books, but I might check out CoH some time.  Can any who have played AO and CoH (and EQ of course ;p) offer up anything about the similarities/differences (other than the fantasy/sci-fi/comicbook genere)?<br />
<br />
edit: grammah!  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">biggest difference really is the futuristic feel of AO plus the list of droppable weaponry/armors...CoH pretty much is more fantasy sci-fi with skill/augment progression and no worry about weapon/armor upgrades.<br />
<br />
Overall, AO is very futuristic. CoH is very comic-book. Both can be fun; but AO will never be on my PC aagin. bad experiences.<br />
<br />
CoH borrowed off of AO's augment-tree system; plus it's mission system closely resembles AO ( minus the vendors; AO you talked to machines; CoH yo talk to your confidants. )<br />
<br />
CoH pretty much is a much cleaner and easier interfaced clone of AO..AO to me was very cumbesome and clunky; plus if you allocated points into fields not of your class specs you were pretty much fuxxored.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ronaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i liked AO for a while, though my MA only made it to lvl 40 or so.<br />
was a fun solo game.<br />
and that was the main problem it had, being an MMO and all that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>unclebong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Man, I hear you on the UI.  I've not got into the custom UI's yet, dunno if they are any better/worse than the stock one. Nice to hear CoH uses a mission system too.  Thats prolly my favorite aspect of AO so far.  I can pretty much play at my own pace when I'm short on game time.<br />
<br />
plus if you allocated points into fields not of your class specs you were pretty much fuxxored.<br />
Were reset-points in the game at that time? I've yet to use any of mine but I know there is a way to fix that these days.  At least to a certain extent.  Dunno if that was in the orginal game or if it is a newer feature.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i played from last of beta up into a month or two into release of AO. I was @ level 121 or so with my MA and there was no resetting of points at that stage ( plus MA's wer going downhill fast ).<br />
hence my desire to pillage the game and macro &amp; 'sploit it to pieces.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Donnel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">MA's really have picked up recently (third best healer, insane DPS, never REALLY have to equip a weapon, ever).<br />
<br />
They added reset points after your time shik, with about 8 or so total in your characters life. Now they have upped that number even more and a new character has 9 or so at the start.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>unclebong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I got a chance to try out the reset points this weekend, what a life saver.  Just got my 2nd enforcer to lvl 40 and the game is only starting to open up.   Soloing, while an option, is not nearly as effective as a good slaughter group.  Overequipped my first Frost Sythe of the Legionnare this weekend.  No weap in EQ ever hit THAT hard! ;)</div></div><hr />
