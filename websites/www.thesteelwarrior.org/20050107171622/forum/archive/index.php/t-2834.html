<br />
Great blade of storm is 179dd + stun<br />
<br />
<br />
everyone talks up the blackout like its amazing.....where does it stand with GBoS and the droppables?<br />
<br />
<br />
i'm not to sure on ratio difference...<br />
<br />
one is 14/18 and other is 16/22 maybe?<br />
<br />
<br />
i have CHSD and GBoS ... should i consider a blackout?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sangiovese</div><div class="date">09-02-2003, 03:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have blackout and CHSD, but no GBoS.  So I can speak about two of the three from personal experience.<br />
<br />
Personally, I think the blackout is about the same as CHSD for aggro... and I would imagine that GBoS is in the same neighborhood (possibly a little better).<br />
<br />
Since none of them are droppable, you would basically be banking one weapon for another that is functionally the same.  I wouldn't bother getting the blackout considering what you already have.</div></div><hr />

Blackout wont be a real uppgrade from ure current setup. If youre guild also do AoW, a BoC would also take the place BEFORE a Blackout.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trast</div><div class="date">09-02-2003, 01:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My current set up is a BoC/GBoS and I like it a lot. Never got the Blackout myself but one of my guildmates has it in place of my GBoS and both draw nice offhand aggro. When it comes down to it the direct damage isn't the big attention getting. It's the stun. Well, that and insulting the monster's mother.</div></div><hr />

Good but not as good as EB proc weapons.<br />
Beyond that you need a weapon with the increased proc rate <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smakz</div><div class="date">09-03-2003, 11:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well from experiance in using blackout as one of my primary aggro weapons.<br />
<br />
I dual wield it with BoC in mainhand...  Tested its aggro out against most of the high end aggro weapons.  I can hold my own against anything that isnt dual EB or BoW.  <br />
<br />
Its about on par with BBoTE for proc rate, hands down owns CHSD in my experiances, CHoS and SotBS are no competition for it, SoD comes close, but Blackout still holds better.  Havent tested it against GBoS as we dont have one in guild.<br />
<br />
Ranking Ichorflow even anywhere near these others is silly, not even in the same ballpark, its more of a DPS weapon, and typically would go to a ranger.<br />
<br />
Blackout is a solid weapon, and maybe im biased cause i use one myself, but ive found to not have a problem with aggro AT ALL when playing MT, Id rank it just under EB weapons for aggro, on par with BBoTE, not to mention the ratio, which makes it a damn fine offhander.<br />
<br />
And for damage purposes, consider the blackout a 18/22, its got +2 mag damage on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Naralli_VoLS</div><div class="date">09-03-2003, 12:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fair enough.<br />
I personally Rank Bloodfrenzy above hategiver and BoC due to proc rate.<br />
I then place BBotE just under as it procs like crazy. If you feel Blackout goes here works for me. Beyond that I see no discernible difference among the plethora of stun weapons that i wield in my offhand ( BoC main hand)<br />
