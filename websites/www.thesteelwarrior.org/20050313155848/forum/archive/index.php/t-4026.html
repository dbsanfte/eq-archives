<br />
I've tried hedging my bets with this weapon. Atm I'm using a Strike of YKesha augment on it while I'm trying to decide if it's really a non-aggro DPS weapon.<br />
<br />
IF it can be a reasonable aggro weapon, I'm thinking I should put Force of YKesha on it. Then I would use it in my secondary slot with a BoC (Anger III) in my primary and switch as soon as I got 2 or 3 hate procs.<br />
<br />
IF it can't be a reasonable aggo weapon, then I should put Ruj Venom or Permafrost on it and weild it with my SEM (with a suitable non-aggro aug) in my secondary hand.<br />
<br />
I understand PoTime has at least 2 weapons more suited for aggro and a BoW with an Anger III aug would be better. However, having looted it I'd like very much to use it the &quot;best&quot; way possible. The 750DD procs and 1500DD crit procs are very entertaining.<br />

I wouldn't put any serious investment into this item. Best bet is to just wait until you get a Vanazir or DBoTW/EoE setup. If you are MTing a BoW will be fine and a BoW with an Anger III or Ykesha mod even better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Megadyen</div><div class="date">11-03-2003, 05:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">just slap an anger 2 augment on it for the hell of it? its only 400 aggro, but doesnt take that much time to get, and would make it of some more use to you, i would imagine at least</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stikka</div><div class="date">11-03-2003, 07:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a Destroyer (as a rogue) and it procs so infrequently in offhand that it is less aggro than my Ifir in off. ie none at all. It is a toy to play with in the hope of seeing 1500 crits. <br />
To give some idea of it's aggro doing one LDoN adventure with a Warrior tank I had 3 straight crits with it on one mob in the space of a few swings so 4.5k in procs plus my usual stabs and backstabs and the mob did not turn on me even without an evade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elidroth</div><div class="date">11-04-2003, 03:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is a non-agro weapon. I'll probably replace it with a cudgel of wrecking for dps purposes since the proc is so infrequent. For tanking.. you can't beat DBotW/EoE.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Boub</div><div class="date">11-06-2003, 05:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since the dps of this weapon comes by a large chunk from the proc, you need to mainhand it. Put it in offhand and you get maybe a third or fourth of the procs. <br />
<br />
Classes like bards and beastlords get the most out of it because they dont loose too much to its ratio since they have only a 20 pct double attack chance at best (via AA), while the proc dmg stays independant.</div></div><hr />

I added a Anger III augment to it and I think it makes an ok offhand weapon. Personally I think LDoN is insanely easy to get points so I didn't have any problem spending 1150 on the aug. I'd rather have a EoE but I wont be looting that anytime soon.<br />
<br />
I ran a parse on the Katta banker using my augmented Darkblade and Ethereal Detroyer, both have Anger III. Total time was 7 hours 28 minutes (448 minutes). My haste was 41% and I don't have any combat effect items yet. Here's the results.<br />

<br />
I have 0 problems with agro, they proc alot. While the proc on the hammer is not an agro proc, it is a high damage proc. The pet can do 830 damage in one round, pretty much makeing it an 0/830 dmg proc. It doesn't do the full damage often though because of the misses and dodges etc.<br />
<br />
I like it over the eoe for better stats and cool pet.</div></div><hr />

I used it mainly when I solo, 750 dd to 1500dd with ingenuity goes a long way towards killing stuff</div></div><hr />
