If I didnt like the look of their site so much Id quit using it until they fixed this.  I addressed it as a bug right after release.  Still no fix, though.</div></div><hr />

What is armor class naked? It isn't even close to 2k)  And the &quot;64.58%&quot; next to the armor is strange...plus his stats shouldn't be showing him as bear anyway.  What am I missing?   His health seems extraordinarily high too.<br />
<br />
Dire bear increases armor BY 360% not TO 360%. To get the bear form armor, multiply his base by 4.6</div></div><hr />

And this is why I took Finite Math (i.e., Math for Dummies) in college and never looked back!</div></div><hr />

finite elements aren't for dummies when associated with unstructured 3D mesh and high-order codes...</div></div><hr />

I think we took different math classes...</div></div><hr />

indeed, even if I didn't went over the top on the math route, I don't think my applied mathematics diploma is for dummies.<br />
<br />
<br />
edit: I think I got it, you don't speak about PDE and discret mathematics.</div></div><hr />
