<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kragrock</div><div class="date">05-18-2003, 11:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Over the past few months ive been reading different threads on possible ways to &quot;fix&quot; the broken warrior.  This for what its worth is my take on the situation.  <br />
<br />
When fighting once I do have a solid lock on a mob it takes a bit to get it off me.  The problem is getting that solid lock in the first place.  At the moment im engaging mobs and effectively soloing the mob for 14 or more seconds at times before I call for assist.  This is even worse when breaking Mezz.  <br />
<br />
So here is my basic idea for a fix.  The creation of a new discipline, to become available from level 45.  As a working name I would call it First Strike.  The basics of it would be a single blow where your weapon had double damage for 1 single hit with a hate proc attached to it.  It would work on a 5 minute timer and would only land on a mob that is at 100% health.<br />
<br />
The theory behind this is fairly simple.  To generate enough agro with one hit to give you a better than 50% chance of keeping agro when breaking a mezz and better than 80% chance of maintaining agro from a slow or such which lands within 14 seconds of engaging the mob.<br />
<br />
Like I said this is just a basic idea at this time and would probably need balancing out.  But this would certainly make my job a little easier.<br />
<br />
maybe nonsense I dont know.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CyrzB</div><div class="date">05-19-2003, 05:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't see it.<br />
<br />
If I'm having problems with aggro after a mez, I taunt more times before breaking a mez.<br />
<br />
If I'm having problems with a mob that's being slowed... well, bit different. Usually the slower waits longer to slow.<br />
<br />
I guess I'm just not seeing the 100% hp part. Heck, most times, I'm not even allowed to pull. Certainly not on raids, and though rather more on exp groups, not regularly then, even. Pallies, Bards, Sk's, Monks, and even clerics or enchanters can generally get singles better then I can. So when I get the mob, it's probably not at 100% hp.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying it's a stupid idea at all, just that I don't see it. Although I certainly don't have a better idea.<br />
<br />
Hmmm... I dunno, maybe I do... You're looking for a way to make warrior taunt massively more effective, but only for a small part of the fight, giving us aggro during the time when SK and Pally aggro outshines us the most. Hmmm... interesting idea. Very interesting.<br />
<br />
If I may make a suggestion, make it 98% or 95% or something... something that means that the puller won't make it impossible to use.<br />
<br />
I could perhaps be out of touch with the average warrior, but I've had epic for a while and BoC for a bit, I don't have aggro problems except for the very beginning, and that seems what you idea is targeted for. I'm not sure I wouldn't rather warrior taunt work above 98% or something, but I definately am starting to see a fix for warriors by allowing more consistant aggro during the very beginning of a fight, but preventing it from being overpowered by not allowing it to work towards the middle or end of the fight. It's definately something to think about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varaho</div><div class="date">05-19-2003, 05:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Main thing I want to see done with /disc is unhooking the timers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">05-19-2003, 06:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I actually think this would be a good idea, a bit like the monk disc that does the special kick.  A short reuse timer is definately required.  I think it would work better if the mob just had to be &gt;90% health, in case it's an add that hits a person with a ds a bit first, or in case the puller or others in the group do some damage before it's to you.<br />
<br />
Though I also agree with Varaho, I'd love it if the disc timers were unhooked.  I actually think all disc timers should be unhooked for all classes that get discs.  Since they are looking for a way to boost melee, that would be a nice bonus (but definately not all that needs to happen).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kragrock</div><div class="date">05-19-2003, 12:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">See, this is what I mean by a basic idea.  I knew there would be little things I had overlooked.  In this case I overlooked 2 things.  <br />
<br />
First:- Damage caused By the puller, and<br />
Second:- Damage caused through a bow peel<br />
<br />
Now if i figure things right, most monks usea thrown item of some description to pull and most warriors who are using a bow to peel off have a fairly decent Bow.  So I think an allowance of 300 points should be fine.<br />
<br />
Why am I trying to be so specific here.  Because I genuinely believe this to be a good idea.  I want to submit this to the Dev team via e-mail.  Yes it may be a complete waste of time, but time is something I have and i'm willing to at least give this a try.  <br />
<br />
But before I do do this I want to get it structured so it is balanced properly.  So it doesnt become overpowering in any way.  The specific goal of this is to do what taunt doesnt do.  Hell not even hate procing weapons are able to do what i'm looking for here and that is having a better than 50% chance of holding agro for more than 5 seconds, without having everyone i'm grouped with sitting around like a dodo for 15-20 seconds while I generate the agro before calling for assist.<br />
<br />
This has to be set up so it can only work at the very start of the engagement and cannot be used midfight.  The idea here is simply to replace that 15-20 seconds on normal mobs and to reduce the time spent building up agro on mini's and boss mobs.<br />
<br />
I'm not looking for something thats 100% here.  I want there to be a chance that a character will get agro if they cast a big agro spell.  I just want the odds tipped in my favour.  <br />
<br />
What I do not want is an increase in DPS or any garbage like that.  I started this game with a druid and soon found it wasn't really me.  At the time the guild I was in didn't really have a main tank, so thus was born Krag and to be fair I genuinely enjoy playing a warrior.  After alot of time reading these boards and others  i figured out one thing.<br />
<br />
'A warriors job is to get hit, to take damage.  Not to deal it'<br />
<br />
I just want the tools at my disposal to be able to do my job properly<br />

maybe more nonsense, i dont know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">05-19-2003, 06:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Unhook /disc timers, and drastically lower the reuse time on some of the offensive discs.  That in itself would help some with locking down aggro.....landing every attack for a few seconds at the first of the fight should help you get initial aggro, so should having every blow landed be either a crit or a crip for the first few seconds of the fight...niether is very useful if you have to wait an hour to do it again though. :)<br />
<br />
Beo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tsaran</div><div class="date">05-20-2003, 11:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A very good idea Krag. We already know Sony has the ability to monitor, and based on that monitor restrict what gets done to a mob. IE: Manaburn. They can do the same thing with First Strike.<br />
<br />
I do agree that First Strike needs to work within a percentage range of HPs OR using the monitor idea check to see if First Strike has been used yet or not.<br />
<br />
I don't think First Strike needs to be double damage more so it needs to be a guaranteed EB type proc on the first hit. You can also balance it out, if necessary, by having the proc check on a particular resist.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Janus_Eci</div><div class="date">05-22-2003, 01:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can see why you'd want it for slows, but breaking mez?  I very rarely have problems keeping aggro after a mez.  Here's what I do... Only works if you're level 55+ for stun kick.<br />
<br />
1. Go behind mob<br />
2. Taunt, disarm<br />
3. Hit kick, then immediately turn on attack<br />
4. The stun SHOULD land if your kick landed, mobs get stunned easy from behind.  You have another combat round and taunt before they get unstunned.<br />
<br />
You should have relatively solid aggro if you do that.  I was tanking a ring event last night in umbral plains, and I used that strategy to switch mobs in under 5 seconds when the previous one died.</div></div><hr />
