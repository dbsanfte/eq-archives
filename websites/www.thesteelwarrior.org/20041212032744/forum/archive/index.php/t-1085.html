Ambi?<br />

I did Area Taunt, PE, Ambidex and Rampage, which is the fastest way to get there.<br />
<br />
Is rampage great?  I dunno.  It's cool once in awhile, that's for damned sure.  Makes factioning a whole helluva lot easier, but for me, it wasn't about the skills, it was about Marshall, which is what it sounds like for you.  <br />
<br />
Regardless of what everyone else says, the title DOES mean something if it means something for you.  It's damned cool to be running around somewhere and get a tell from a true noob in his 20's or something that says &quot;Wow, Marshall... i've never seen one of those before.&quot;  Everyone can be a cookie cutter ND/CS/CA warrior, but you don't have to be.....that's the beauty of the Warrior AA path.</div></div><hr />

I plan to go for flurry though, just because it seems to be the most substantial of any of them (besides area taunt and PE and Ambidexterity)</div></div><hr />

Get the PoP class AAs first.  If anything, most of them are much more affordable than the 3/6/9 Flurry on class which is the only good class skill (not counting the two must haves).</div></div><hr />

<br />
i would have been better served getting feroricty or PB instead of class flurry which only has a chance to go off on a triple strike.<br />
<br />
getting it before you finish defensive aas like CS, CA, LR, and ID is really foolish though. i shoulda waited till i had pb and ferocity maxed myself, vanity got the better of me hehe.<br />
<br />
if you wind up using a 2her, ambi is totally waised. rampage, i dunno how that is the least bit helpful, at least flurry draws more agro with more swings, no matter what your setup happens to be.<br />

class aas just suck = p</div></div><hr />

It's a VERY good DPS upgrade if you use a 2 Hander. Flurry plus Punishing Blade 3 combo naturally because PB3 gives you more triples, which then turn into flurries.<br />
<br />
So if you wanted to get Marshall spending least points i'd go..<br />
PE (5)<br />
AE Taunt (5)<br />
Flurry 1 (3)<br />
Flurry 2 (6)<br />
and either<br />
Flurry 3 (9) or Ambidexterity (9)  <br />
Depends on your usual weapons when tanking.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm just finishing up the defensive skills now, needing 14 more points to do Innate Defense, and then perhaps another 10 to do Stalwart Endurance 2 and 3. After that, generic DPS increases like Tactical Mastery, Ferocity, and CF 3 / Fury of the Ages will take priority over PB and Ambidex (I use 2h when not tanking, 1h for aggro, want to put off training AAs that only boost one or the other for as long as possible).... after all that, I will finally train PB, ambidex, and then rampage. That should put me at somewhere around 160-180 AA I think before finally hitting Marshall hehe.</div></div><hr />

However, I have deliberately chosen not to, and was hoping for some debate about the choice of skills in Class AA's, not so much the validity of my choice.<br />
<br />
Thanks for those (few) who did post with an answer for me.<br />
<br />
For the record, I have 22 points right now, due to awkward planning for PE use, and I'll have Marshall at 46 AA (24 points in Class for new title).<br />
<br />
Most likely, my path at this point will be:<br />
<br />
PE (5 points)<br />
AET (5 points)<br />
Ambi (9 points)<br />
Rampage (5 points)<br />
<br />
I'm considering double riposte (suck), or even skilling up Combat Fury 3 (+12 points) to do Flurry 3 (18 points, with PE and AET).<br />
Who knows.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Either way, it doesn't really matter.  The DPS you gained from Flurry and Raging Flurry is fixed anyway, and it's not like next patch you'll suddenly flurry twice as much as before because they make Flurry work with all attacks (assuming it used to only work with triples).</div></div><hr />

<br />
can anyone shed a bit more light on what you need to do to qualify for it? really just out of curiousity, i dont intend to do offensive aas till i have all my defensive ones maxed out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
PoP AA &amp; PoP Class has nothing to do with it.<br />
<br />
With the poor selection of class AA, it's not unusual to still be a Veteran with 100+ AAs.  I'm at 180 AA right now with the Veteran title (projected 194 AA for Marshall).</div></div><hr />

<br />
the raging flurry description implies that flurry itself is triggered from a triple attack, maybe im reading too much into it, but thats way it sounds to me.<br />
<br />
im not sure PB gives you more flurry, its just an extra swing out of the blue, i doubt it counts a  triple attack when you double, fail to triple, but then PB.  ferocity gives you more double attacks, that should give you more triples which would give more flurry. i would guess on each combat round(dly of weapon) you roll to see if you PB, it could count as a triple if you only double but i doubt it.<br />
<br />
dunno if ferocity &gt; PB, just maxed ferocity and goign for PB next anyways heh.<br />
<br />
anyone got suggestion after PB, i still havnt done TM, raging flurry, or pop crits. i would guess raging flurry is best, then crits, then TM. only going to be using a 2h.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">06-12-2003, 08:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I thought I read somewhere that someone parsed flurry.  Not only did it only go off on triple attacks, but also Fero and PB increased how often it went off.  Anyway, thats how I believe it works.<br />
<br />
My suggestion.. Flurry actually.  More swings is good.  Means more chances to proc, and basically more aggro.  Works whether you end up using duel wield or a 2hander.<br />
<br />
Personally, I will be a marshall at aa 143.  Can check my magelo to see which route I went.  AA's I highly recommend are: Innate Metab3! (very nice, trust me), and PB is a definate need if you use 2handed.  Actually, if you use 2handed, I'd recommend PB before CA or CS, for me it simply did a ton, and with it I keep aggro with a pure dps weapon, even defensive.<br />
<br />
There is nothing wrong with wanting marshall just for marshall.  We all play this game for different reasons, most of us for fun.  So get whatever aa is fun for you.</div></div><hr />

I chose flurry 3 over ambidex because Flurry works with all weapons where as ambidex only works with 1h'ers according to the description. Also having FLurry 3 opens up the possibility to do Raging Flurry in the PoP aa's, and ambidex is just a dead end.<br />
<br />
Anyway I finsihed all my defensive aa's cept stalwart endurance, and then I did Flurry. So I now have my Marshall title at 156 AA's.</div></div><hr />

I don't have any parses of pre ferocity flurry figures, but going by the description for raging flurry personally I feel it's like this after having all my offensive junk done:<br />
<br />
-Flurry chance works off successful tripple attack rolls<br />
-Ferocity increases your chance to double attack (indirectly increasing your chances for a tripple attack roll as it felt to me)<br />
-More tripple rolls leads to more rolls for a flurry chain. Raging flurry increased my yellow spam by a fair ammount from regular flurry3<br />
<br />
As for punishing blade, I don't have a decent 2h so I haven't cared to burn points on it yet. As such I can't comment on flurry rate 2h+pb vs dual wield. Now of course I have no hard data to back this up, but you don't always need the hard facts to feel things.</div></div><hr />

i flurry fairly consistently with just normal flurry3(using 2h no less), and guildmates say the raging flurry is really noticable upgrade.<br />

i got pb1 then went ferocity though, hard to believe they arent about equivalent since extra doubles will feed triples/flurries/crits...hard to be definative without parses.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I did AE Taunt, PE, Rampage and Double Riposte 2 for Marshall.  Rampage isn't very useful, kinda cool to have sometimes but I don't use it often.  I'd use it a lot more if it said the whole Qris goes on a rampage business.<br />
<br />
You know that I use a Greatstaff of Thunder almost all the time so ambi would have been pretty useless for the time being.  Double Riposte does the same thing (adds DPS) except it works with both one handers and two handers.<br />
<br />
I'm aware of the fact that I could have spent the points elsewhere and they would have been more useful but my class title was a goal of mine and if I could go back I'd still choose the same path.  Plus, it's cool being a Marshall :p  People assume that I have a billion AAs and that I'm better than others so I get groups more often and in turn get AAs faster :)<br />
<br />
BTW, I got title with 46 AAs (run 3, sta 3, nd 3, ae taunt, pe, ca1, rampage, dr2).<br />

Okay, that's probably a stupid analogy, but who cares?  I got Marshall at around my 90th aa.  I could have waited an selected some more useful aa's first, but since it was an important personal goal for me, I detoured to get it.  I dont regret it a bit.<br />
Plus its always nice to run into people I haven't seen in awhile and have them gratz me on my title. (again with the ego thing) :)</div></div><hr />

after that it is whatever does it for you but above AA makes warrior do their job much better which is to tank. With those you can tank pretty damn well. going marshal right away is a waste but if you wana be a cool dude with flury or double reposte or some shit be my guest.</div></div><hr />

With the rampant compliant about aggro woes, I'm surprised more people don't opt for a more offensive path.  I am quite certain no amount of defensive AA is going to fix your aggro woes, but being able to swing more often or do more damage at least has a chance of getting the mob's attention.<br />
<br />
Of course, offensive AA isn't the warrior's salvation to aggro woes, but it's pretty obvious that defensive AAs aren't doing anything whatsoever to help warriors about their aggro woes.  From a casual observation, warriors with all the offensive AA do seem to hold aggro better (and this make sense too since aggro is largely a function of DPS, especially since we have no spells), and I have never heard of a warrior who was able to hold aggro better from any amount of defensive AAs.</div></div><hr />

It's not only that the offensive AA path gives you more DPS, it's also gives you more swings, so more chances to proc.</div></div><hr />

Sure sometimes taunt wont work when someone will bite it but that is all part of the game. As for going offensive AAs lets not fool anyone here if you go offensive before defensive it is all about your ego.</div></div><hr />

Actually, I got PB3 before most defensive aa to help with aggro, which it actually did quite well.  It had nothing to do with my ego, it had to do with being able to keep taunt given a limited number of weapons to choose from.  When I first got my staff, it truthfully didn't do much for aggro... with each point I spent in PB it got a bit easier.. to the point of no problems now with PB3</div></div><hr />
