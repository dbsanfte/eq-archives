WTF?<br />
<br />
Since when did we do a deteur into the Christian Crusades...?  What, do some of these guys really think they're fighting some sort of holy war?  What is this, King Richard the Lionheart against the Sarasins?  Get out of EQ and go play Civ or Age of Empires or something.  *sheesh*<br />
<br />
Maybe I'm not deep enough into this game to appreciate this crap...  I like my warrior, she kicks ass plain and simple and she doesn't need any god to tell her whose butt to kick, she's agnostic, doesn't need frickin' Karana to tell her what to do either.  Heck with that crap.<br />

<br />
Whats all this garbage about Knights being superior to warriors in history anyway?  Obviously some folks don't read their history very well to spout off that kind of diahrea-of-the-mouth...<br />
<br />
Knights existed in the middle ages, and they were all about some holy crusade, which I'm sure if you ask the Sarasens (or whatever other enemy they attacked because they believed it was the Will of God) didn't think it was all that holy!<br />
<br />
Warriors have always existed and will always exist.  The celts had warriors.  The Romans had warriors.  <br />

You know, it is sweet to see you kissing warrior ass all the time, but you should read the thread here and the one on PoN that this late-breaking rant is in-part based upon. I don't recall anyone coming to this anon troll's defence or seriously backing their stance. In fact, I see quite a few people pointing out how pathetic the attempt was on both TSW and PoN. In fact, the thread on PoN was locked because it was obvious to everyone who read it that it was a weak attempt to fan the flames of this argument between warriors and the knight classes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And what, exactly, are you talking about?  If you read one of the linked threads I was advocating the counter to this arguement as my very first post to this board.<br />
<br />
Whether a paladin feels himself superior or not because of some title he throws onto himself is not the issue.  What I'm pointing out is that paladins aren't somehow superior to warriors in the way they claim.  It's a fact of life you will just have to get over.<br />
<br />
I don't frequent Paladins of Norrath.  I hung out in the God's Might forum a while, started one of the most popular threads in that forum, and have constantly disagreed with this idea from day one, don't come here telling me I'm kissing warrior ass because I'm weeding through BS.<br />
<br />
Now do you care to point out instances where I'm wrong, or are you going to try to hide behind &quot;Oh you're a kiss ass Ezedriel&quot; and leave it at that?<br />
<br />
yeah, that would be real fair, penalize all the deity following classes who wanna advance in the game but allow the rest to have no penalty (in referance to the MM killing)<br />
<br />
While I don't agree to a huge punishment to paladins who kill Mithaniel Marr, I do agree that a religious class killing their deity should have some kind of consequence, or some kind of handicap during the fight.</div></div><hr />

Would have to remove him as a flag mob needed to progress essentially kinda like how tunare is.  They do get penalized and rightfully so.<br />
<br />
Also you would require this to be a factor for pretty much anyone who derives their power from their chosen deity, so basically clerics (which would suck for alot of raids if they didnt want the faction hit), paladins, sk's, necro's, druids, and rangers.  Prolly missing some, but you get the point.</div></div><hr />

Tunare, Innoruuk, Cazic, etc...on the other hand... <br />
<br />
Personally, I feel that people aligned with a certain god should, at the very least, not be allowed to use the loot of that god.  However, if you make strict punishments for following a diety, there should be equal rewards to it.  I think it is also a bit unrealistic to do at this point in the game.  Severe penalties could seriously hamper progress to people unfortunate enough to choose the &quot;wrong&quot; diety years ago.  I think the only type of game that could support a feature like this would be EQ2, where you start as a base class and don't become a specific one until later.  Ie-start as a warrior type, and later in your career choose to be a paladin and *then* choose your god.  That would give a person sufficient time to understand their decision.</div></div><hr />

He was not a righteous man and was not raised by the decree of the church. In fact, he was raised under water by faeries. :eek:<br />
<br />
Arthur, on the other hand, could arguably have been a paladin and Lancelot beat the living hell out of him in a square duel. Well, right up until Arthur called upon his god to give him and Excalibur super strength to strike Lancelot down.<br />
<br />
Almost immediately after Lancelot's death (after the Spider Man &quot;With great power comes great responsibility&quot; speech by Merlin) Arthur then prayed to his god and resurrected Lancelot. :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gyrfalcon</div><div class="date">11-20-2003, 05:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">According to history, it was the common warrior using new weapons (pikes, bows and guns) and new tactics that brought an end to the age of Knights (heavy cavalry). Especially after the advent of gunpowder weapons, heavy armor became useless on the battlefield, as it became more important to manuever in combat than it was to shed your enemies blows.<br />
<br />
If you have any question of this, look up the history of the Battle of Crecy and the Battle of Agincourt. In these two battles alone, the capability of the English common warrior left the field flowing with French knight blood.<br />
<br />
Pikes, wielded by highly rained soldiers, brought an end to the ability heavy cavalry had to dominate the battlefield. The shock of a lance charge was wasted on the forest of 15 foot pikes a well coordinated tercio could bring to bear. The only time knights would play a decisive role in the batlefield from that point on was in taking advantage of a weakness in an enemies' line, or cutting down a fleeing group of men.<br />
<br />
To be historically accurate, though, these mounted, armored warriors weren't &quot;paladins&quot; in the sense of the game term. The closest to a paladin we might get in the hostorical record would be Knight Templars from the holy orders that were formed during the Crusades. And these men were singularly devoted to the advancement of their faith, so much so they were willing to kill the unbelievers to prove it. So much for medieval Christian values of love and forgiveness.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jynn Tlespirit</div><div class="date">11-20-2003, 12:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The age-old debate about which class is better is really rather pointless unless someone just enjoys debating.  Each class has its strengths and weakness and appeals.  Which class is best to YOU depends on your personal preferences.  Basically each class has a niche to fill out in a fighting force.<br />
<br />
As far as people role-playing.  To me, that is one of the appeals of this game.  Not very many people strictly role-play any more, but it does add a certain flavor.  Penroc comes to mind.  She plays a paladin and often goes to zones and offers to rez, buff or assist anyone in need at no charge.  I have even heard people griping about her which boggles my mind.  Someone is offering to buff and rez for free and it offends them.<br />
<br />
I grouped my shammy with two barbs who were strictly role-playing and it was the most fun I had in ages.  Used to hang out with a dwarf named hakkum who was always drinking and bemoaning the fact that while he thought high elves were beautiful creatures he could never love a woman without a beard.  At that point he would ask me how old I would be before I starting growing mine.  <br />
<br />
I don't hunt in Plane of Growth although my guild goes there often.  I do go to newbie zones and buff, help break up spawns, pull whatever to help out from time to time.  People helped me when I was young and I am returning the favor.  Aside from that, it seems like the paladin thing to do.  Doesn't make me better or worse than anyone, just a paladin.<br />
<br />
When I play my bard, I often recite poetry or &quot;songs&quot; to the zone.  I always announce beforehand I am going to do it and advise people to put me on ignore if they are offended by role-playing.  <br />
<br />
A group of dark elves used to come to Felwithe quite frequently to wipe out the guards.  There was always a lot of banter back and forth between the races.  Their raids would be followed up with a raid on Neriak where we would announce the crime of the dark elf clan and its leader and then carry out the death sentence on Neriak guards.  All this while buffing the dark elf children and giving them food and drink because it was the &quot;noble&quot; thing to do.  Sutpid?  Maybe.  Fun?  Definitely.<br />
<br />
Some people enjoy role-playing.  Some people enjoy the interaction of the game with others and the fantasy aspect of it.  If it's offensive, put them on ignore.<br />
<br />
As far as the historical debates about which type of fighter was the best...that's about as productive as debating the EQ classes or whether marines are better than army.</div></div><hr />

Sorry it took me so long to get back to you, but I had work to do yesterday. To point out where your post has issues, as you have asked me to do, let's go through it line by line shall we?<br />
Paladins believe themselves greater than warriors<br />
This is a blanket statement that, in the context of this thread and the originating threads, is only applicable to one person’s post and that person obviously wanted to start further arguments between warriors and paladins. Warriors and paladins pointed out repeatedly that this person was a fool, so I am failing to see how this blanket statement is even remotely accurate. Of course, since you run a paladin you would be included in this statement if it were accurate.<br />
they are under the false assumption that a historical knight is somehow a warrior's superior on the battlefield.<br />
First and foremost, the only person who seems to want to claim that knights are historically superior is the anon flamer that started the originating thread for this discussion. This would be the person that warriors and paladins dog piled onto and showed how stupid he was. Be that as it may, you have requested that I show you issues with your post and so I bring you the following.<br />
<br />
It depends on what you mean by superiority on the battlefield because, if you were talking about actual rank, then yes the knight would be superior to the rank and file warrior. However, I assume that that is not what you meant and that you were in fact talking about the ability of the person to live through a battle and thwart his enemies. In this context, there are actually several advantages most knights had over most warriors on the battlefield: equipment, training, diet, etc. Of course, the rank and file warrior had some distinct advantages over a knight, the primary one being mobility/range of motion. All of these things are factors in a person’s survivability, which equates to battlefield superiority.<br />
<br />
But wait, archers were able to kill knights and they were peasants! Of course they were, welcome to technological and strategic advancement. Every method of warfare changes and the rise of the longbow was the demise of the heavy plate of the knight, similar to how the rise of the gunpowder weapon ended the use of the longbow in combat.*<br />
<br />
But the Swiss pikemen were the only military group of the age that was never defeated and they were merely foot soldiers! That is correct and they are a perfect example of military tactics and practice being applied to geography. There is a reason they were never defeated, of course that is the same reason they wouldn't fight outside of the mountain passes.<br />

*Light plate continued to be used well into the 1600s and body armor continues to be in use today by military and police forces around the world. Similarly, the use of bows and crossbows, continues to this day.<br />
Which is utterly foolish. There were instances of knights stronger than warriors, but those were few and far between.<br />
Um, ok. I am still trying to figure out what you meant by this. If you mean physical strength, then you very well could be right. Of course, I am not sure how that would apply to much of anything. While strength would certainly give a person an advantage in physical combat, endurance and cardiovascular capacity provide for much more once the person is capable of wielding their weapons and carrying their armor.<br />
If any paladin wants to get into a debate with me about historical or fantasy paladins, they can feel free, but their speculation that works over on the paladin board won't fly with me here.<br />
I have seen your posts in the God’s Might forum and many of them are off base when you are speaking of the history of knights and the holy orders. You have a poor understanding of the church in the middle ages, its domination of life, its fickleness, and its ties to money, land, and power. You have a weak grasp of military context and tactical evolution.<br />
<br />
That would be my response to your exact post if you wanted me to give it a little more than a cursory glance. Of course, my main purpose in posting in the first place was to point out the fact that this topic had been covered once before and neither warriors nor paladins came to the original poster’s defense, which seems to be what you were wanting to debate since the implication of your response was that paladins agreed with the anon troll that started this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ezedriel7th Ham</div><div class="date">11-20-2003, 02:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is a blanket statement that, in the context of this thread and the originating threads, is only applicable to one person’s post and that person obviously wanted to start further arguments between warriors and paladins. Warriors and paladins pointed out repeatedly that this person was a fool, so I am failing to see how this blanket statement is even remotely accurate. Of course, since you run a paladin you would be included in this statement if it were accurate.<br />
<br />
Perhaps the reason you believe this is because you have seen two of my eleven or so posts on this message board, perhaps because you see my debates with Gilfalas and Hudspeth, perhaps because you want to assume that I am jumping on an opportunity and making things up.<br />
<br />
Well, the fact is this is what I encounter from paladins every chance I get.  Paladins are ALWAYS trying to justify themselves on their own message board (trying to define what they are and why they are etc. etc.) and are always in philosophical debates about themselves.  They don't have a strong grasp of what a paladin really is and are constantly in flames over it.<br />
<br />
Frequent the paladin channel, a common belief IS seen amongst several paladins that they should be &quot;superior warriors to warriors because they are blessed warriors&quot; or &quot;knights&quot;, though the only reason it wasn't implemented was for the fairness of the warrior class.  I base my arguements on experience, not on some random person who comes in an attempt to fan the embers of animosity amongst the two classes.<br />
<br />
<br />
First and foremost, the only person who seems to want to claim that knights are historically superior is the anon flamer that started the originating thread for this discussion. This would be the person that warriors and paladins dog piled onto and showed how stupid he was. Be that as it may, you have requested that I show you issues with your post and so I bring you the following.<br />
<br />
Again see above.<br />
<br />
It depends on what you mean by superiority on the battlefield because, if you were talking about actual rank, then yes the knight would be superior to the rank and file warrior.<br />
<br />
You are correct.<br />
<br />
 However, I assume that that is not what you meant and that you were in fact talking about the ability of the person to live through a battle and thwart his enemies. In this context, there are actually several advantages most knights had over most warriors on the battlefield: equipment, training, diet, etc. Of course, the rank and file warrior had some distinct advantages over a knight, the primary one being mobility/range of motion. All of these things are factors in a person’s survivability, which equates to battlefield superiority.<br />
<br />
I'm talking raw skill and the ability to keep himself alive utilizing what he could, not the ability to hide behind an oven of a suit of armor and laugh as frightened individuals threw stones and wood at you.  I'm talking grabbing what you could and making your way through a fight.  I'm talking learning a mastery of your weapon and trusting it with your life because it would be the only thing that got you out of this hell-hole of a battlefield.<br />
<br />
A knight never had to deal with a situation like that...they were always behind their well protected armor, their swift horses, and were usually the ones making decisions.  If they were in peril it was because of their own arrogance (as was seen in a forced charge near Tripoli at the outbreak of the Third Crusade, when the Master of the Temple ordered a sixty knight or so knight charge against Saladin's recon forces of seven thousand.  The Master of the Temple and four other knights were the only survivors).<br />
<br />
The knights did not have to rely on skill as much as they had to rely on their armor and their hordes of warriors in front of them to keep the enemy from eaching the knight.  Again in the Crusades at the Battle of Hattin, Saladin issued extra arrows to his archers and ordered them to fire on the horses as a surprise attack before firing on the men.<br />
<br />
The men then were simply baking pots of flesh with narrow slits to see through while arrows and crescent swords came down on every side of them, skewering them.  Only the lord of Tripoli escaped with his small portion of soldiers, the king of Kerak and King Guy were also captured, the former being executed for his refusal to part to Islam and beg forgiveness for violating several truces and kidnapping Saladin's sister.  The latter, and the Master of the Temple, were used as bargaining chips to try to win over other Christian held cities.<br />
<br />
The Muslims that defeated the knights were common warriors utilizing their skill and mastery of combat, it had nothing to do with their superior armor, training or any of the sort.  It had nothing to do with divinity it had nothing to do with diet.<br />
<br />
They outsmarted and outfought the Christians after luring them away from their supplies of water and food.<br />
<br />
But wait, archers were able to kill knights and they were peasants! Of course they were, welcome to technological and strategic advancement. Every method of warfare changes and the rise of the longbow was the demise of the heavy plate of the knight, similar to how the rise of the gunpowder weapon ended the use of the longbow in combat.*<br />
<br />
Please don't disregard the Battle of Agincourt, where King Henry V's archers, when exhausting their supplies of arrows, charged the French Knights and beat them down with club, stone, and bow.<br />
<br />
Technological advancement eh?  Of what, a gigantic piece of flexable wood?<br />
<br />
But the Swiss pikemen were the only military group of the age that was never defeated and they were merely foot soldiers! That is correct and they are a perfect example of military tactics and practice being applied to geography. There is a reason they were never defeated, of course that is the same reason they wouldn't fight outside of the mountain passes.<br />
<br />
Wait a second, so warrior strength is disregarded by you because they outsmarted and had more patience than knights?  No no no, the warrior has more to do than just use his sword, or his pike, or his axe.  He has to plot where and when the troops are going to come and outsmart them.<br />
<br />
If he outsmarted the arrogant knights he is still a greater warrior.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Um, ok. I am still trying to figure out what you meant by this. If you mean physical strength, then you very well could be right. Of course, I am not sure how that would apply to much of anything. While strength would certainly give a person an advantage in physical combat, endurance and cardiovascular capacity provide for much more once the person is capable of wielding their weapons and carrying their armor.<br />
<br />
I am referring to their &quot;strength of arms on the battlefield&quot;.  Their &quot;ability to defeat a knight&quot;.  It has nothing to do with a physical characteristic of a given warrior on the field.<br />
<br />
The warrior was the one who toiled and tilled his lands daily, who trained day in and day out with his weapon, the one who could rely on nothing other than surviving this battle for no other reason than because he wanted to live.<br />
<br />
Knights were muscular if they were not wealthy lords who decided to sybarite themselves with their wealth.  Those many sybarites would lavish in their wealth, growing quite fat off their abundant source of food and wine and because of this they proved to be very unable warriors.<br />
<br />
Hell let's look at the muslim warrior.  He was not granted this ability, he was not allowed to drink the same as the knight, he was forced to train entirely differently.  But that can be disregarded because it proves your theories wrong doesn't it?  It can be disregarded because &quot;those warriors had an advantage in a given area, so why should that be considered in this arguement&quot;?<br />
<br />
<br />
I have seen your posts in the God’s Might forum and many of them are off base when you are speaking of the history of knights and the holy orders. You have a poor understanding of the church in the middle ages, its domination of life, its fickleness, and its ties to money, land, and power. You have a weak grasp of military context and tactical evolution.<br />
<br />
I have a poor grasp of the middle ages and the church in that time period?  I don't understand military context and tactical evolution?<br />
<br />
How about I don't bother debating with Hudspeth because he is like a faithful troubador or minstrel who refuses to admit that his lord isn't a shining example of chivalry?  What about Gilfalas's flamboyent arrogance and inability to accept any opinion other than his, to the point that he harasses and bans people for disagreeing with him?  What about Occam, who does great insult to the person who's name he borrows, the philosopher who created Okham's Razor which stated:<br />
<br />
``Pluralitas non est ponenda sine neccesitate'', which translates as ``entities should not be multiplied unnecessarily''. <br />
<br />
In other words, that which requires the least amount of assumptions is most likely true.  And yet this is the man who will argue to the teeth that &quot;Freeport Militia don't take prisoners and the prisons are in fact a conspiracy&quot; or that &quot;Sir Lucan D'Lere doesn't have trade with Faydwer because they see him evil, and rather he has thousands of brewers creating Elven Wine just to create the facade that he has trade going back and forth with Faydwer&quot;.<br />
<br />
Could it POSSIBLY be that I don't bother debating history with these people because to them the word fact is an affront to their senses, and if I were to debate it I would be banned for pointing out that Richard the Lionheart was a homosexual who slept with King Phillip of France?  Or that he was a ruthless murderer who drowned, beheaded, or blinded victims who worked for his brother Henry?  And again to those who worked for his other brother John?<br />
<br />
Perhaps I don't argue there because I don't feel like being banned by Gilfalas because I state that the original Master of the Temple after the second crusade was a malicious and arrogant murderer who used the bible when it benefited him and skewed several passages that cost hundreds of men their lives?<br />
<br />
But wait this can't POSSIBLY be it, it has to be that I don't know a thing or two about history.<br />
<br />
I don't know about the Church, like how they dragged people kicking and screaming behind closed doors where they tied several hundred pounds to the feet while binding your hands to the ceiling, and if you did not confess they would drop the floor and let you rip in two?  I don't know how the Church manipulated every single part of daily life and ensued such terror into people of Hell and defiance that children even threatened to go off on a crusade for the sanctity of their souls?<br />
<br />
Or maybe I don't know about how they found a piece of wood and claimed it to be a piece of the True Cross in order to get Christians to fight harder underneath it, and cursing them for cowards if they did not?  Or how they would lie between their teeth and mess up passages in order to provoke people?  How they would excommunicate people for the slightest and stupidest of things and make their lives a living Hell?  What about promising people an eternity in Hell if they did not abandon what the bible REALLY said in favor of what the Pope said?<br />
<br />
Yes I have zero grasp of that don't I?<br />
<br />
That would be my response to your exact post if you wanted me to give it a little more than a cursory glance. Of course, my main purpose in posting in the first place was to point out the fact that this topic had been covered once before and neither warriors nor paladins came to the original poster’s defense, which seems to be what you were wanting to debate since the implication of your response was that paladins agreed with the anon troll that started this.<br />
<br />
Or, perhaps, I responded because I agree with warriors, because I have seen this debate and have argued it in the paladin channel time and time again, perhaps I don't even mind debating it when Im' not under the harsh restriction of Gilfalas and his insane obsession with me.<br />
<br />
And perhaps you should stop trying to narrow me out just because I'm a paladin who agrees that knights aren't historically the masters of combat?  But in fact warriors are?<br />

That is an interesting interpretation of “in the context of this thread and the originating threads”.<br />
a common belief IS seen amongst several paladins that they should be &quot;superior warriors to warriors because they are blessed warriors&quot; or &quot;knights&quot;<br />
Interesting how all becomes several.<br />
I'm talking raw skill and the ability to keep himself alive utilizing what he could, not the ability to hide behind an oven of a suit of armor<br />
The Muslims that defeated the knights were common warriors utilizing their skill and mastery of combat, it had nothing to do with their superior armor, training or any of the sort. It had nothing to do with divinity it had nothing to do with diet. <br />
So, being armored is a negative and equates to hiding. Interesting. Of course, that means you have negated just about every soldier throughout time. Again though, you missed the point of my statement, which I am starting to realize is a common trait of yours. So I am going to break it down for you. Here is how advantage works. <br />
<br />
If you have two equal people and you equip each of them with a sword they are still equal. <br />
<br />
If you give them both a set of armor, they are still equal. <br />
<br />
If one set of armor is leather and the other is plate, then the one in plate has the advantage in protection and the one in leather has the advantage in mobility/range of motion.<br />
<br />
If you give the one in plate formal training in the use of his sword before going into battle and the other is conscripted from his fields and expected to learn as he goes, then the one with training has the advantage.<br />
<br />
If you provide full meals to the one with plate armor while only giving thin soup and wormy bread to the one with leather armor, then the well fed one has the advantage.<br />
<br />
If you give the trained, well fed, and plate armored one a horse while giving nothing to the other, then the one on the horse has the advantage.<br />
<br />
Now, does having the advantage equate into certain victory? Nope. A man with a knife can kill a man with a rifle, but if asked who has the advantage I would still say the man with the rifle.<br />
They outsmarted and outfought the Christians after luring them away from their supplies of water and food.<br />
You seem to like to leave out the fact that the rank and file Christian warriors were defeated as well. This is taking the debate out of the arena of class distinction and pitting European military tactics against Muslim tactics.<br />
Please don't disregard the Battle of Agincourt, where King Henry V's archers, when exhausting their supplies of arrows, charged the French Knights and beat them down with club, stone, and bow.<br />
Please don’t forget the field conditions on that day. The victory had far more to do with the mud on the field than it ever had to do with the archers. Also keep in mind that they were forced to charge the knights because their arrows had been fairly ineffective (no longbows).<br />
 Technological advancement eh? Of what, a gigantic piece of flexable wood?<br />
Congratulations on showing your poor understanding of military evolution. YES, THE BOW WAS A TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENT! I can only hope that you were trying to be funny.<br />
 Wait a second, so warrior strength is disregarded by you because they outsmarted and had more patience than knights? No no no, the warrior has more to do than just use his sword, or his pike, or his axe. He has to plot where and when the troops are going to come and outsmart them.<br />
I disregarded nothing. What I said was that the Swiss pikemen are a great example of military tactics applied to geography. The fact is that the tactic of the phalanx was perfect for the location that it was used in, but it was severely limited in applicability outside the region.<br />
The warrior was the one who toiled and tilled his lands daily, who trained day in and day out with his weapon, the one who could rely on nothing other than surviving this battle for no other reason than because he wanted to live.<br />
The warrior that toiled on his lands (very debatable in feudal Europe that they are “his”) is the one who was rarely able to train and was lucky if his blade was of high enough quality to hold an edge. Those who trained day in and day out are the mercenaries who relied on battle for their livelihood. Please don’t mix the two together.<br />
Hell let's look at the muslim warrior. He was not granted this ability, he was not allowed to drink the same as the knight, he was forced to train entirely differently. But that can be disregarded because it proves your theories wrong doesn't it? It can be disregarded because &quot;those warriors had an advantage in a given area, so why should that be considered in this arguement&quot;?<br />
Again, you are skipping over the fact that these Muslim warriors were also defeating Christian warriors along with the knights and therefore you are again taking this out of the arena of class discussion and putting it in the realm of European versus Muslim combat tactics.<br />
<br />
Also, what theory did I put forward?<br />
Yes I have zero grasp of that don't I?<br />
Yes. Being able to regurgitate fact is not understanding. Being able to take fact and follow the lines of cause and effect so that you can draw out the essence of a movement or action is what understanding history means. Your ability to type fact is not what I have questioned, although it is suspect in some areas on PoN that have no relevance to this thread, what I have questioned is your ability to apply fact and understand it.<br />
And perhaps you should stop trying to narrow me out just because I'm a paladin who agrees that knights aren't historically the masters of combat? But in fact warriors are?<br />
The only reason I singled your post out is because you were implying that paladins were agreeing with an anon flamer, which they did not in the threads in question. Your master of combat statement is irrelevant, especially considering the fact that knight or warrior could be a master of combat or a complete neophyte because of the way the a compulsory system works.</div></div><hr />

Don't assume ignorance unless you care to show off your own!<br />

I HAVE read the stories.  Many different versions of them.  Including the Mists of Avelon, which was by FAR the most interesting.<br />
<br />
I will say what I want about them,  I will be cute if I damn well feel like it, or not cute if I feel like it.  You don't call the shots here.  Last I saw there was no sign up that gave you sole right to comment on anything.<br />
<br />
You DID call me out over a harmless joking comment I made that  Red Sonya could kick Sir Lancelot's pansy ass (and she WOULD), and you made a sexist little snipe about it.<br />
<br />
So maybe you should watch her story before you assume she'd be hot to trot over your adultorous idol Sir Lancelot.<br />
<br />
He was an adulterer, had no respect for his King's honor, which says a great deal about his &quot;knightly&quot; virtue.  I don't think any self-respecting woman would sleep with him.  And, no I don't think the King's wife was a self-respecting woman, by definition of the fact that she also sacrificed honor for the sake of her lusts.<br />
<br />
Red Sonya on the other hand, lives by a very simple creed.  Don't sleep with a man unless he can beat her in a fair fight. That to me says a lot more about honor than the hoity-toity courtley kind espoused by the Arthurian court.<br />

In a true Conan vrs Red Sonya fight, Conan would more then likely put her on her butt.<br />
But I think Sonya would smack Lancelot down.<br />
<br />
But Conan would own them both. and as I said.. then send his hoarde agaisnt the rest of europe etc decimating it.<br />

Again lookit He did manage to win in Californa @@<br />

Kadah, correction taken.  Its been 10 years or so since I saw Red Sonya, but you are right Ahhhnold played a different barbarian in that tale, not Conan.<br />
<br />
Yeh, he may be able to kick Red Sonya in battle - but Xena would kick them BOTH!<br />

Do I believe some moistened bimp chucked a sword at a kid and made him king? Not likely.<br />
<br />
However, since the Celtic tribes had no written language, their histories were passed down through stories. Anyone that's ever played the Telephone game knows that a sentence can't make it around a room without it getting distorted. Imagine what thousands of years do to a whole story. :p<br />
<br />
Aside from that, during the region's early Christian days, the old tales were all recorded by monks with a decidedly Christian flavor. Beowulf and Arthur are two stories that immediately leap to mind as having been &quot;creatively edited.&quot;</div></div><hr />

I would add that the bible also was &quot;creatively edited&quot; but thats a whole other subject :)<br />
<br />
You should try reading The Mists of Avalon.   This version of the legend focuses more on how christianity wiped out the old religion of the Celts...its actually very well written and well researched.  If you saw the miniseries on TV, it was good but the book is much better.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">11-21-2003, 01:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;You DID call me out over a harmless joking comment I made that Red Sonya could kick Sir Lancelot's pansy ass (and she WOULD), and you made a sexist little snipe about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Considering how sexist and repugnant BOTH conan and red sonja are, calling me sexist for defending lancelot is quite entertaining.<br />
<br />
Robert E. Howard was no sterling model of morality, let alone FEMINISM. And the comic books that sprang up from his writings were anything but feminist in nature.<br />
<br />
&quot;I HAVE read the stories. Many different versions of them. Including the Mists of Avelon, which was by FAR the most interesting.&quot;<br />
<br />
I meant something written before the 20th century.<br />
<br />
&quot;So maybe you should watch her story before you assume she'd be hot to trot over your adultorous idol Sir Lancelot.&quot;<br />
<br />
If you're referring to the very horrible movie made about the marvel comics character, I have indeed seen it. A couple of times.<br />
<br />
And it was not impressive at all.<br />
<br />
It didn't even capture the flavor of the comics, as was typical of comic book adaptations from that time period. Then again, Red Sonja comics didn't give a film-maker much depth to build on. At least the handful that I have read. :P<br />
<br />
&quot;He was an adulterer,&quot;<br />
<br />
He was NOT an adulterer in ALL stories about him. And not in all stories about his relationship with guenivere.<br />
<br />
&quot;had no respect for his King's honor,&quot;<br />
<br />
Again, I ask you to read the stories. He helped Arthur ACHIEVE this honor you accuse him of not respecting.<br />
<br />
In some of the tales, it was Gawain who disrespected Arthur for putting the king in such a precarious position as to having to call Lancelot's own honor into question.<br />
<br />
&quot;which says a great deal about his &quot;knightly&quot; virtue.&quot;<br />
<br />
The POINT of many of the different tales is that the knights often failed to uphold the standards they held so high.<br />
<br />
Then again, the point of many of the other tales had nothing to do with virtue, and everything to do with adventure.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;And, no I don't think the King's wife was a self-respecting woman, by definition of the fact that she also sacrificed honor for the sake of her lusts.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ah, which also shows how little you know about the character of Guinevere, who in some of the tales has been shown to be a powerful queen in her own RIGHT, before marrying Arthur. And as such was able to choose her OWN bedmates, and again, because of this did NOT dishonor Arthur at all.<br />
<br />
Again ... it depends on the story you're referring to.<br />
<br />
But to call Lancelot a pussy and state that he would not stand a chance on the field of battle against anyone ...<br />
<br />
It just shows a severe lack of knowledge concerning the actual character himself.<br />
<br />
And your continued posts about the arthurian legends pretty much support that.<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
<br />
&quot;You should try reading The Mists of Avalon. This version of the legend focuses more on how christianity wiped out the old religion of the Celts...&quot;<br />
<br />
If you liked her work in Mists of Avalon, you should try reading some of Marion Zimmer Bradley's other fiction. It's all pretty entertaining, and fun to read.<br />
<br />
I like how she breathed new life into the arthur legend. It was beginning to get kind of stale.</div></div><hr />

I am so NOT interested in getting into a petty little post dissection session with you.<br />
<br />
I said I have read stories about Arthur.  You are making tons of assumptions about which ones I've read.  I never said my reading was limited to the Mists of Avalon, or books of the 20th and 21st centuries.<br />
<br />
This is a completely moronic debate over a comment I made in jest, that Red Sonya would kick Lancelot's pansy ass, I can say it as many times as I want to, and if you choose to get your jockstrap in a wad over it, thats your tough.<br />
<br />
The arguement is pointless, since whatever side you take is completely relative to your personal perspective on ths issue, since both characters are fictional in the first place.<br />
<br />
*sheesh*<br />
<br />
If you want to waste time taking my posts apart word for word to continue this completely meaningless debate, its certainly your choice.  Go for it.  My opinion stands.  I know what I have and have not read, you do not.  You assume.  And I don't need to spell out what happens when you ass-u-me, but I just did anyway because otherwise you're likely to assume I mean something else.<br />
<br />
As for the issue of sexism... Conan is no more sexist than other movies of its time and genre, and Red Sonya was not technically a &quot;Conan&quot; movie, as Kadah correctly pointed out.  Your comment, however, was sexist.<br />
<br />
In any case, I have more important things to do than argue back and forth with you about Red Sonya would kick Lancelot's ass,  would not, would too, would not, would too, would not, would too, would not, would too, would not, would too, would not, would too, would not, would too.....etc etc etc<br />

<br />
However, if you make strict punishments for following a diety, there should be equal rewards too <br />
<br />
You have a reward already. It's called a spellbook. The reward for strict punishments is the ability to use the gifts bestowed upon you by your diety.<br />
<br />
 The continuing discussion, now on multiple threads, that stems from the troll seems to want to focus on rl. The fact is, this is a fantasy game...everything is loosely based on the D&amp;D/Tolkien/Dragonsbane model of character classes. RL/history has no bearing whatsoever on any aspect of the game. In addition, we don't have &quot;knights&quot; in this game...we have Paladins and Shadowknights (anti-paladins). You can bandy about titles all you want, those are the classes. The Paladin derives all his otherworldy power from the steadfast service to his diety. In return for that steadfast service, he is granted powers not available to a standard warrior.<br />
<br />
Because of playability, Paladins are not beholden to their diety in the way the class was originally designed in the game systems from with Everquest draws its inspiration. Therefore there is no counterbalance for their power. In D&amp;D, for example, a Paladin who &quot;broke the rules&quot; would lose all his powers and risk physical harm from his diety up to and including death. This is not an issue in Everquest. As such, the counterbalance to the spellbook is supposed to have been lesser tanking prowess.<br />
<br />
So in response to your statement, if the game were to reintroduce the beholden nature of the Paladin to thier diety, and the resultant faction headaches that would go along with that, I would have no problem with them tanking exactly as well as Warriors. There would be a cost associated with that extra power.<br />
<br />
You would not, of course, be able to group or guild with characters of evil alignment, most especially Necromancers, Shadowknights and most shaman...or any other class that followed a diety in diametric opposition to your own. But you would of course be rewarded with full warrior abilities in addition to the bonuses of a spellbook.<br />
<br />
No...wait. You already have that now without any penalty for defying or even killing your diety...don't you.<br />
<br />
peace,<br />

I no longer am discussing Lancelot's merits, or Red Sonja the comic book character's merits, or Conan the pulp fiction character's merits.<br />
<br />
I'm merely trying to point out how you base your assessment of Lancelot on some 20th century literature, and your assessment of the two other characters on their movie appearances.<br />

In other words, your depth is lacking. <br />

That made no sense. But uh, thanks anyways.<br />
<br />
&quot;*Zhenobia can kick Lancelots butt,&quot;<br />

Also, just to re-iterate ... the point you made wasn't that YOU could kick his butt. It was that Red Sonja could.<br />
<br />
While I obviously disagree that the chain-mail bikinni wearing &quot;tart&quot; of Marvel Comics' &quot;fantasy&quot; line could stand toe to toe with Lancelot ... I'm almost positive that a low level warrior from the FV server would fall to one of the fabled champions of the round table.<br />

In fact, Lancelot would probably one-round you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Knights were warriors, they were just warriors with the best gear, some semblance of political power, and their own land. Basically knights were twinked warriors, in EQ terms. ;)<br />
<br />
If they were talking about paladins or shadow knights being superior to warriors in history, then yeah, that's garbage. I'd be interested to know when the first paladin cast Minor Healing in real life. <br />
<br />
Hint: paladins and shadow knights don't really exist in real life. If someone brings real world history into an argument about the relative balance between warriors and paladins and shadow knights, pat them on the head, wipe the drool from their chin, and tell them &quot;there, there, it will be all better once the flying monkey comes to feed you the magic sleeping potion&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, that's a tough one to pin down.<br />
<br />
St. Joan of Arc possibly?<br />
<br />
But no, we all know St. George predates her. And since we know warriors can't solo dragons, he had to be a paladin, a class that has been proven CAN solo a dragon.<br />
<br />
Then again, there's documented evidence in the song of roland of quite a few &quot;paladins&quot; casting more than a minor heal here and there.<br />

You thought it would be funny to just up and say &quot;HAR HAR Lancelot's a pussy, and even Red Sonja could whoop his ass.&quot;<br />

Mongol General:  &quot;Wrong!  Conan, what is best in life?&quot;<br />
Conan:  &quot;To crush your enemies, see them driven before you, and to hear the lamentation of the women!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
I love that quote, also like:-<br />
<br />
Conan's Father:  &quot;No one in this world can you trust.  Not men, not women, not beasts.  [Points to sword.]  But this... this you can trust.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JAFFO</div><div class="date">12-05-2003, 08:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A little off the topic, but i wanted to address the act of killing your own GOD.  I think thier should be some major reprucussions to doing this.  I am a 65 ARCHON in the service of Brell Serilis and i feel that if I played a hand in his death (And  yes i know that he dosent have a modle yet) i should lose all my clerical abilities, and while the raid force is fighting him i dont think that a follower of a GOD should be alowed to use thier GOD given abilities to help the enemy force. By defention all of the cleric's abilities are gifts from thier GOD for absoulute devotion, I dont think a GOD for example would allow me to cheal warrior_01 who is presently kicking the hell out of him, and think about DI (Cleric's GOD watchs over you and saves you from death), Humm is it just me or does that just seem wrong to allow DI to fire if you are killing that same GOD, i.e. a cleric of Brells Serilis cast DI on warrior_01: Warrior_01 begins to smack Brells, now come what are the chances that Brells is going to save you while he is trying to kill you. At the same time do you think he would really answer that clerics call to cheal warrior_01. <br />
<br />
  If anything i think it would be cool to have the GODs summon all thier devote followers to thier aid when a large enemy force attacks. Imagine you engage GOD_01 and he summons all his followers who are on-line to aid him in battle. Now instead of just fighting a GOD, you are also fighting 50 knights and 100 clerics who just got summoned, It would add a very interesting twist to things.  But if nothing else i think that the followers of GOD_01 shouldnt be allowed to use thier abilities to fight him and if they do assist with the fight then thier should be very harsh consiquenses.<br />

Points to anyone who knows what a Merovingian actually was. <br />
<br />
&quot;The Merovingians were a dynasty of Frankish kings who ruled a (frequently fluctuating) area in parts of present-day France and Germany from the 5th to 8th century AD. They were sometimes referred to as the &quot;long-haired kings&quot; by contemporaries, though the significance of their long hair is not clear. <br />
<br />
The Merovingian dynasty (see List of Frankish Kings) owes its name to Merovech (sometimes Latinised as Meroveus or Merovius), leader of the Salian Franks from about 447 to 457, and emerges into wider history with the victories of Childeric I (reigned about 457-481) against the Visigoths, Saxons and Alamanni. Childeric's son Clovis I went on to unite most of Gaul north of the Loire (486), to adopt Roman Catholicism (496), and to decisively defeat the Visigothic kingdom of Toulouse in the Battle of Vouillé (507).&quot; <br />

<br />
I have a nice book about Agincourt on my book shelf...odd it doesnt mention warriors or paladins in it at all...<br />
<br />
&quot;The Agincourt War&quot; Lt-Col Alfred H. Burnes, Woodsworth Miltary Library ISBN 1 84022 211 5 copyright 1955<br />
<br />
In all my readings of that book I've gained context of the battles of that time and what solidiers did (hell there's a chapter on ol Joan of Arv in there too!).  To tie those roles to that of a fantasy game is to put it lightly...not exactly relevant (although it sounds fun).<br />
<br />
The other thing I've learned about history is that most &quot;facts&quot; are far from certain and to say another person's knowledge is incomplete is the height of arrogance<br />

<br />
Not that she had an opinion. But that she seemed fixated with a chain mail bikini wearing comic book character that was targeted at 13-year old boys.<br />
<br />
:P</div></div><hr />

<br />
That was just such a cheap shot, I really am disappointed your picking on someone because they enjoy a certain character from a book / movie / game. <br />
<br />
Grow up man.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Knight (http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=Knight) can be ALOT of things. A warrior can be a knight. A Paladin on the other hand is something completely diffrent. They have an exstrem high moral standart, which means alot who try, fail to become Paladins.<br />
<br />
Knights, warriors, Paladins, Barbarians. They all have good and bad legends. But they are basicly the same but but moralic and dovotionary diffrences.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am picking on her for a far different reason than what she likes as books, movies or games. And it also has nothing to do with her sexual orientation, which I assumed was heterosexual.<br />
<br />
You don't like that? Fine.<br />
<br />
I didn't ask you to.<br />
<br />
After being called a sexist male jerk by her many many times, I really don't care that I took a cheap shot.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Oh, and another thing ... don't lecture me on maturity, when you contribute THIS to a thread:<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay I'll end the arguement.<br />
Lancelot is a PUSSY. period. He is a whiny lil bitch. <br />
Conan is da man And there was a damn good quote from the barbarian flick about killing one's enemies and raping and plundering their /land. &quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
In four years gender has only been worth noting once for me. A putative female sent me a cyber /tell ending with her removing one of my boots. I sent a tell back something like, &quot;Ooooooh sure feels good ta get me dogs outta them boots. Now lassie, suck me toes if ya must, but don't be taking off me socks. I think they'd fall apart if ye tried.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now if ya'll are doing so much cyber with the &quot;females&quot; that play this game that gender and preference is important to yas, ya oughtta get outside a little more.<br />

<br />
As a matter of fact, you all suck, horribly, especially the pallies for causing a thread that got turned into such a steaming pile of falsely subversive pseudo-political agendas laden with the sexual frustrations of the &quot;Gamer Geek&quot; sub-culture.<br />
<br />
And furthermore, you are all wrong because I am correct!<br />
<br />
Lastly: T-800 &gt; Conan, Lancelot AND Red Sonia combined, with one arm melted in a molten pool of steel~</div></div><hr />

<br />
The suckage has already bottomed out. You can't have negative suck. Because negative suck is actually NOT sucking. And this thread sucks, has sucked and will continue to suck.</div></div><hr />

The only thing I see sucking is you on your own ass to try and look cool by flaming someone whether male or female, Though from refrencing your posts you seem to enjoy taking pot shots at women. <br />
So shut up you whining lil poser monk and go back to monkly buisness if all you can do is talk shit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What the hell are you talking about?<br />
<br />
Read what Zhen says in this exact thread Kadah. She did NOT read the comics. She did NOT read the arthurian stories. <br />
<br />
She just watched the movies.<br />
<br />
Which I'm perfectly fine with.<br />
<br />
But she ACTED like she's read the stuff. Like she knew what she was talking about.<br />
<br />
That's the problem I had with her assessment of the characters. Her lack of knowledge.<br />
<br />
It has nothing to do with her sex, her tastes in literature, anything. She was posing as an expert on a subject she has no freakin clue about.<br />
<br />
I called her on it. I simply asked her about it, and poked some fun at her, trying to see if she did have any depth to her familiarity with the characters beyond a movie.<br />
<br />
And she jumped on me, attacking me.<br />
<br />
&quot;try and look cool by flaming someone whether male or female, Though from refrencing your posts you seem to enjoy taking pot shots at women. &quot;<br />
<br />
Oh please, THIS I HAVE TO SEE.<br />
<br />
Quote me, to your heart's content. DEMONSTRATE I take enjoyment out of taking pot shots at women.<br />
<br />
Show the evidence.<br />
<br />
Where is it shown that I enjoy taking pot shots at WOMEN.<br />
<br />
I took a pot shot or two at Zhenobia, an unmitigated ASSCLOWN who took dozens of pot shots at ME.<br />
<br />
So ... please, find evidence of me taking a shot at a woman, other then Zhenobia, who it's obvious I don't like and WILL take pot shots at.<br />
<br />
Show me a quote. Show me some evidence.<br />
<br />
Until then, kindly shut the fuck up.<br />
<br />
&quot;So shut up you whining lil poser monk and go back to monkly buisness if all you can do is talk shit.&quot;<br />
<br />
I believe it was you who said:<br />

Yeah, I was mean to Zhenobia. Yeah it was and IS on purpose. <br />
