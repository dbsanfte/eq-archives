<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">depends..if you're doing MT work wouldn't you want the copper hammer primary and shortblade offhand?<br />
<br />
prob for most normal exp'ing though the disemboweler pretty much made it's way to your trader mule.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I agree with Shik, although selling the SoL and Disembowler and buying a Sword of the Bloodsworn would be an even better option, and you would probably have some cash left over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Truelove</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Wandor I seen how much cash your pottery mule makes - go buy a BoC and stop pissing about =P<br />
<br />
For my mind I would main hand the hammer as the stun proc is a damn sized more taunt than the extra dps between a 13 19 and 13 20.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hammer has to go mainhand Wandor.  It procs like ass in offhand.  My mainhand was proccing 5 or 6 times as much today as the hammer was offhand, and that's with Ambidex.<br />
<br />
Plus the 179 DD would outweigh any minor DPS difference between the 2 anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Brokkah Narrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hammer is fun, and procs a fair amount :)<br />
<br />
Mainhand it with SoL offhand</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">you guys talked me in to it ...<br />
<br />
And the BoC is the eventual goal TL, but this damn tailoring/smithing is breaking the bank!!! To think people do trades for fun ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Smakz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">id mainhand the hammer, with Diseboweler offhand ... <br />
<br />
Disemboweler = 15/20 when you add in the magic damage<br />
<br />
thats a hella better ratio that SoL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Truelove</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Wandor - you gotta upgrade your mains neckslot, hahahahaha<br />
<br />
Flog those bracers (in fact give them to me) and buy a BoC, thats getting on for the sickest twink I have seen in a while =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It is totally ironic that my main wears a 65hp/65mana player made piece of crap while my twink has just about the best tradeable gear you can buy. You'd think I would stop spending plats on the twink long enough to bet a decent neck for my main!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Why do you have to spend plat on your neck slot? isnt that what your DKP are for  ? :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Good int caster neck slots are very hard to come by in Time, so far there are only 2 that I could use and neither has dropped for us. Same thing in the elems, very few int caster usable items and I never had the DKP when they dropped since they tend to be pretty uncommon. I could just buy a better neck slot, but that would take away from the warrior twink fund ;)</div></div><hr />
