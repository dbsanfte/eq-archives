<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">melrathe</div><div class="date">12-29-2003, 07:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all!<br />
<br />
Was hoping for a little help from those more experienced.<br />
<br />
I am currently a lvl 25 ogre warr on Stromm and had completed all of the newbie warr armor quests. For the few spots that there wasn't a quest, I filled them with pieces/parts from PC or the bazaar. But, my guild (brand new on Stromm) is slowly looking to me as the MT for groups/ the low level practice raids we are doing. <br />
<br />
I have a feeling however that my AC is a disgrace (right around 450 unbuffed). I am not a twink, this is my first real char, and I love the warr game style. However I am now very concerned that my current setup is not going to get me by much further and am wondering how to proceed. I check the bazaar regularly for gear, but it seems that prices are still way inflated on Stromm (was looking at the crafted armor -- bracers alone were around 2000 pp). I only have about 100 pp to my name. <br />
<br />
So, what should my upgrade path be? I know there's a million but I just would like to know what my options might be. Are the crafted quests really doable at my level? Or the crusty quests? I have read a bit about both of these. Should I just go to HHK to try to kill the guards?<br />
<br />
I did search old messages but didn't really find what I needed (gotta get better at the searching). So I am now looking to my elders for advice. Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ahz</div><div class="date">12-29-2003, 08:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Crustacean armor can last into the 50s.  LDON armor excepted, it is the best you can expect to see until Thurgadin quest armor.  It's dropped by some fairly tough mobs in Cobalt Scar, so I don't think you'll be winning any any time soon.  It should be very affordable in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
The points given by the LDoN adventures pre-65 are so paltry as to make a 760 pt LDoN drop take for-freakin'-ever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anker steadfast</div><div class="date">12-29-2003, 09:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Crafted armor is aimed at being done with groups ranging from 20 to 40, with the Breastplate being the toughest.<br />
<br />
In fact, Bracers I remember doing at level 19 together with a druid and a Cleric, pre Kunark ! those Evil-Eyes are easy. Was the one that roams around in East Karana,w as kinda fun since it charmed me for a bit.<br />
<br />
I did all the pieces except the Breastplate with groups here and there (was aso easier to get groups in that level range back then) The Breastplate I bought from a druid for 800 pp ... he soloed the drop in Mistmoore at leevl 49 I think.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyways, I do not know how the prices are on Stromm, so hard to advice. So dunno about prices on Crustacean armor, but it's nice if you can get a good price on it.  <br />
<br />
However, I would recommend doing some of the Crafted Armor Quests together with Guildmates, they can be quite fun.<br />
Quest giver is in South Karana btw .. it's one of the Centaurs.</div></div><hr />

Bracer of Scavenging from Warsliks is better than crafted bracer and should also be doable. In the meantime, look for someone skilling up smithing and get some Fine Plate; no stats but decent ac. I think I was still wearing a mix of bronze and fine plate at level 25...</div></div><hr />

<br />
LDoN is about the best bet for gear progressively; but in all if you're the poor fool that's going to be the guild's MT :D than have them all chip in to help you do the crafted quests.<br />
<br />
Hel, mistmoore would be a trip at your level. Go for it !</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ariene</div><div class="date">12-30-2003, 08:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gothic Steel Breastplate (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=23364) <br />
MAGIC ITEM<br />
Slot: CHEST<br />
AC: 27<br />
STR: +3 STA: +4<br />
SV MAGIC: +6<br />
WT: 5.5 Size: SMALL<br />
Class: WAR CLR PAL SHD BRD<br />
Race: HUM ERU ELF HIE DEF HEF IKS FRG<br />
Slot 1, Type 2<br />
Slot 2, Type 2<br />
<br />
Would watch bazaar for this set of armor (search gothic).  Cost to a smith to make it is ~60-100p per piece.  On most servers it is selling between cost and double cost but I think on Stromm it might be a bit higher since there is more market for lower level items.  Each piece of this set has decent AC with STR, STA and SvMagic.  Unfortunately no raw HPs but the sta is good and if you find a good deal on it, it might be good for you.  Specially good from this set is face slot - hard to find an AC 10 face elsewhere.  Also shoulders seem popular (I used to smith it).<br />
<br />
Misc stuff I ran into that might work for you:<br />
<br />
Lumberjack's Cap  (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=1471) - AC: 10 STA: +3<br />
<br />
Cracked Bone Helmet (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=23333) - AC: 14 DEX: +3 WIS: +3 INT: +3 SV COLD: +2<br />
<br />
Fungus Crown (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=7475) - AC: 6 DEX: +5 HP: +20 SV MAGIC: +5<br />
<br />
Runnyeye zone has some nice AC items that I'm guessing are common.  Should be good xp while you hunted but not sure that trading HPs for AC is a good or bad idea.  Belt at least is pretty good - Black Alloy Girdle (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=6024) AC: +8 Sta: +5.  Zone also drops a nice caster neck so might be good place for your guild to spend a few days.  Whatever no one will wear can be vendored for cash to buy more upgrades.<br />
<br />
Permafrost has some nice items although only one that I really thought good for a warrior.  Might be another nice place to explore with guild though.  I remember having a lot of fun there and there are a lot of named in there with decent drops.  XP and  Vendor loot was good if nothing else although you might be too high for good xp here.<br />
<br />
Unrest is incredible xp at your level.  Bronze armor drops are common so plat is good there and there are some named drops that might be worthwhile.  If you go with a group you trust, have a druid or wizard bind right outside the zone and then self port somewhere to sell and gate back to /split.  You should all make a lot of plat in a short time that way.  This is probably my favorite zone in the game.  Take your cleric there and he/she will love you forever.  :)<br />
<br />
Just realized Tak theme has a 20 point set of armor that isn't too bad.  Not all the slots would be upgrades for you, but it might be worth looking into.  You could earn those in a couple days worth of adventuring and they would be nice fillers until you got better upgrades.  Example: Sand-Coated Gauntlets AC:12 Agi:2 DR:2, Jeweled Guard Hoop (finger) AC:4 HP:25 MR:5.  Shoulders from MMC for 16 points: Savagefang Spaulders AC:6 Sta:3 CR:10.  From Miragul (EF) for 16 points: Cursed Cloak (back) AC:5 Sta:4 Cha:4 Agi:4 CR:4 and for 20 points: Frosty Jeweled Necklace AC:4 Dex:7 Sta:7 HP:10.  You can go to the LDON Merchant Database (http://www.squidbox.com/skp/eq/ldon/list.cgi) for a searchable list of all the LDoN drops and search for whatever slot you feel you most need to upgrade.  If you can find an upgrade for the amount of points you can earn in 1-2 days I think it would be a great deal for you.  Anything that will take much longer then that prob isn't worth it at this point since you will be upgrading again soon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For the fingers I'd go for the good old jewelry crafted Velium fire Wedding Ring, buy two of them as you get the pp for them, they will last you well into the 50's. They are AC 6, HP +65 and have no level restrictions.<br />
<br />
Also, if you don't have one yet, a Goronga Idol for the Ranged slot is very nice and generally pretty cheap in the Bazaar due to them being Lore. They are AC 8, Dex +4, STA +3, HP +25, also no level restrictions.<br />
<br />
With a little luck you might be able to pick up a Silvery Mask for a cheap pp, it's a face slot item with AC 5 and HP +25 ... again, no level restrictions. :)<br />
<br />
For weapons, you should probably try and buy some Centi Shortswords, they are decent Dam 12, Delay 24 which is very good at your level (though you can never have too much damage).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ahz</div><div class="date">12-30-2003, 10:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">At level 25, how many adventure points do you get for a normal adventure? Something like 3?  It's horrid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">12-30-2003, 10:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Guys, don't forget that at level 25 he'll be getting about 1 point per mission. So a 52 point belt will likely take him 52 missions, which is one hell of a time investment. Lower levels are best spent camping items rather than running through missions for them. On that note, definitely look into crafted armor. It really is decent stuff for quite a while, and is really one of the best sets of quests in EQ. You should be able to do the quests with a group. You might want to look into farming tradeskill items, such as silks and whatnot with a group. The spiders in East Karana drop quite a few, and should be some very decent exp for you afaik.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hollowshade also drops some nice items of the named not just for a war (haste stuff) but for all the guild (wis/int and even one FT1 item) and it may be fun for your guild to control all the camps and manipulate the named spawning and at the same time farm those components(you can use for shadowscream armour but most of all raise smithing so you can do cultural), give you good skills working together.<br />
<br />
Save any Blue diamond you get, look for the essences you need for your armour and keep those, when smithing is high they will be nice to have.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">melrathe</div><div class="date">12-30-2003, 12:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow thanks for all the replies.<br />
<br />
Just started doing LDoN last night.  Did a couple of &quot;normal&quot; missions outta BB and pulled one AP per, so the AP's look like they will take some time. Maybe I will try to do some harder one's but I wanna get a feel for the game play with LDoN first (agrro range, mob sociability... etc. don't wanna overpull). Did get a set of the gauntlets tho on the second mission from a drop.<br />
<br />
As for the gear suggestions, thanks a lot, I will be looking for those items. <br />
<br />
Also, thanks for the Hollowshade suggestion. The GL was looking for another suggestion for a &quot;practice&quot; raid and I think I will bring this up to him.<br />
<br />
I am also going to definitely hit Unrest, but in guild we are very light on healers, and I have none around my lvl that are available. I play on Stromm as I do not have a core group of RL friends that I play with, and I think this would be the best server right now for pick up groups at my lvl/experience with the game.  <br />
<br />
Finally I am also gonna skill up in smithing..... just trying to generate some cash to cover the expenses :)<br />
<br />
Thanks again All</div></div><hr />

Smith if you wish to be a smith, but know that it will cost you alot to master your chosen skill.  On average, half a million plat to get up to 250.  Now, there are some ways to make money....and if ya go into sol A and farm your own high quality ore, you can make quite a bit while skilling up.  Helps a bunch if you are evil race and can run to neriak to use the ore cuz it'll weigh ya down alot and Lavastorm is a bit off the beaten path.  Best place to smith is in the bazaar....I know it's laggy, but there is no encumberance movement penalty and that helps ALOT.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jinaabi</div><div class="date">12-30-2003, 12:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A note about LDoN, always insist at your level to do hard missions. At 25ish, they are so mindlessly easy, I really saw no real difference between the normal and hard at that level. <br />
<br />
With my chanter, at level 31, I did a hard with 5 people, and a druid was the healer. I stopped slowing half way through, and started meleeing, lol<br />
<br />
Keep in mind, I still only got 4 pts at 31, but they do add up faster if they are doubled per time invested :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">melrathe</div><div class="date">12-30-2003, 01:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">And thanks again for the LDoN information. I will inform the other newbies I group with about the benefits of doing hard missions at out lvl. <br />
<br />
Also, re the smithing. What I meant was that I was trying to save up some money to pay for the materials needed to skill up in smithing :D ! I have absolutely no expectations that I will acutally make money doing it, but it seems like the most appropriate skill for a warr. Thanks for the tip re lavastorm and SolA too. Heh, me big strong Ogre.... and have been there with a group once, so I won't have any problems with the ore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">12-30-2003, 02:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't do LDoN. Ever.  Waste of fucking time.  Always.  Everyone who says they got this l33t aug or whatever wasted a shitload of their life that they could have spent getting multitudes of real upgrades.  I'm sure there's gonna be plenty of people arguing about how awesome it is, but half my guild has LDoN, while the other half doesn't, and I still just shake my head and laugh at every fucking +6 dex aug they brag about, while I farmed up 200kpp in 8 days.  What's better...those worthless augments and the fraction of an item you can buy at an adventure camp, or REAL money with real value, and real items that you can dump in the bazaar for cash.<br />
<br />
Obviously this isn't going to happen at your level, but if you're 25 with a group of people who want you to be a tank, then fucking tank. Take them to Sol B.  Take them to guk.  I rolled up some twinks with my buddies a couple weeks back, they just hit 20.  We're having a fantastic time in guk, very little issues.  Granted we have a little help in the DPS department thru some broken recommended level items with high DD procs and some extra FT items we had laying around, but it's really not that difficult.  Camp the stuff you can camp in the dungeons that were designed for you.  You'll have a blast, get cash, get real life experience, and you'll get upgrades naturally, without much worry.  When you're 35,  you'll be pimped with an Executioners axe, and a FBSS won't be far ahead of you.  You've got nothing to worry about if you've got a group of friends who play with you every nite.</div></div><hr />

<br />
LDoN is definitely NOT the way to go for gearing up at low levels.<br />
<br />
Have your guild do mini-raids in zones where it gets you the crafted armor, or other good warrior drops. They may as well get used to equipping you first anyway, since that is the proper way for a guild to gear up. Take care of the MT, then the clerics... and the rest will fall in line.<br />
<br />
Don't be bashful about your needs with the guild.. after all, they are the ones asking you to step in front of mobs for them!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">melrathe</div><div class="date">12-30-2003, 05:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I can see that at my lvl LDoN is not the way to go for eq upgrades. But it is fun with the mission/time frame component for when I don't have lots of time to be online. <br />
<br />
Definitely gonna try to set up some raids to accomplish some of the quests, not just for me but for the other warrs still learning the game in my guild. We still got a lot of work to do in that dept. Also will be looking for other quest items for the other needy folks I know. Thanks again all!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">12-30-2003, 07:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">LDoN can be just fine, as long as you do it for exp, fun and maybe some drops. It might be worth it, if the exp is any good. If the named drop some loot that you and your friends would use, then great. Don't try to do it exclusively, don't even go out of your way for it. Old world dungeons absolutely rock for exp and fun though, my friends and I started up EQ after a break as a warrior, a cleric and a bard and had some of the most fun I've ever had EQing.<br />
<br />
 Some dungeons we hit: Najena, Crystal Caverns, Chardok. If you have a group of people that can dedicate a few hours, you can basically go to any dungeon with mobs your level and tear it up. Najena has bronze and fine steel drops, Crystal Caverns has some neat random named drops as well as quite a bit of money off mobs and Chardok has money and random loot off of any of the mobs. Most of the old world dungeons are pretty neat, and are now much easier to get to than before PoP/Luclin. Check out Allakhazam's for some decent dungeon information.</div></div><hr />

A bit confusing though, unless you get some maps for it.<br />

Even the Endboss of the dungeon is cool looking. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
You mean the devalued plat that flooded most servers and wrecked the prices of real items that clog the bazaar?<br />
<br />
LDoN may indeed be a timesink, but it's got time on its side. And that's something the bazaar doesn't have.</div></div><hr />

If you're not really worried about PoTime and are looking to max out short of, say, Ssra, LDoN is for you.<br />
<br />
 Currently, with me and mine, it's a mix. I can get decent upgrades with 1-3 group mini raids on places like Plane of Mischief or that sort of thing while also being able to work LDoN on the side to eventually get the bigger upgrades.<br />
<br />
 Don't let the jaded Time farmers talk you out of a very reasonable option at your level.</div></div><hr />

If I have to think about it, I would go LDoN again if I wanted upgrades. Go to BoT and meet the freaking greedy ppl that roll on every god damn mold that drops? No thanks, I already lost too many molds to druids and wizzies. I dont think I could have farmed the amount of pp that takes to buy a piece of gear like Malevolent in the time it took to make 15 missions, plus, the AAs I got there.<br />
And I dont think you can buy Anger procs in bazaar.<br />
There is some nice Plate armor in EC for 48 points. The next one is in BB for 150. Just to add something to the main topic of the thread :)</div></div><hr />

I don't know when the nice +6 augs start dropping.  When you are sub-65, a few +6 STA augs can go a long way.<br />
<br />
LDoN should be a nice way the get some exp and have some fun.</div></div><hr />

High Hold can eat my sword, Dawnshroud makes me gag, all the other places that the normal crowd goes to just plain suck. If I have to go looking for a group, I'd rather have the 1 1/2 hour commitment with 5 other people who are out for the same thing (good xp, perhaps a drop) then muck around in a group somewhere, where fights will erupt about kill stealing and ninja looters and idiots.<br />
<br />
But then again, I don't have a Warrior and a Shaman I two box to farm plat with. So mebbe it is just me.</div></div><hr />

1) some of the BD cultural armor can be gotten fairly cheaply in the Bazaar.  I picked up a Brellium BP for my warrior for 4kpp, and 2 bracers for 3500.<br />
<br />
2) LDoN.  True, at lower levels, the points for wins sucks, but the XP is decent for a full group compared to any other zone, up to 51.  Once you're 51, and can get bonus XP and can go to PoP, well, LDoN doesn't compare so favorably anymore.  But pre-51, it's an easy place to find a pickup group, compared to other pre-51 dungeons.  Another advantage to doing early LDoN is that you can be racking up your charm aug upgrades.  Having a +100HP/MANA, +10 to all stats aug at level 50 or so would be very nice indeed =)<br />

At level 25 you might get a drop off a named in a LDoN adventure, but getting 1-2 points per sucess you'll be leveling faster than your points will add up. I'm basing that on my LDoN experience with my upper 30's Beastlord who graduated from getting 4 points on his first normal level 35 (I think, forget the level range of the group, may have been 30)adventures to getting 10 on a hard level 40 one. Took him just about 2 weeks to save up 72 points to get his pack shrew spell, and in that time leveled from 38-45 as a Troll with 20% exp penalty. My rambling point being...once you do have 20 points saved up, you'll probably be close to level 30, so that's 5 levels for one piece of armor.<br />

Runnyeye is a great zone at that level and was my favorite. Blackened Alloy pieces drop off random mobs for your plate and chain classes, Dark Muslin for leather and silk classes,, as well as fine steel weapons deeper in. Plus there are several named. One drops the venerable Blackened Alloy Bastard Sword (Ahhh memories:)) Sporalli Gloves are 9% haste. Black Alloy Medallion is a caster's dream neck with Mana Preservation II, we camped that for my Shaman when he was level 31. A complete list of Runnyeye drops can be found here (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/itemzone.html?zone=27)<br />
<br />
Permafrost named seem to skew their drops toward casters a bit more, but they'll want equal time too. I had 4 other people that I played with daily when I first started, we just all saw we were on at same time and grouped. We went to Perma at level 14-16, was our first dungeon experience ever and got rolled so fast. Can a person be panicked and have the time of their life at the same time? Was just great! Here (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/itemzone.html?zone=47) is the list of Perma drops. Permafrost is slightly higher level than Runnyeye acording to Alla, and both give a healthy experience bonus.<br />

Najena I never got to, so can't talk from experience, but should also be good and it has a key system like Befallen. When your groups average high 20s Sol A and Splitpaw will be fun and good places to make some cash.<br />
<br />
Definately gather a solid group to do your crafted armor quests. Take turns each day and do a different quest for each memebr of the group. A great way to develop bonds in the game.<br />
<br />
I wish you well</div></div><hr />
