<br />
Shaman, Cleric, Warrior, Bard, Rogue is our regular group.<br />
<br />
Bard rogue and warrior are 55 at the moment.<br />
<br />
<br />
What would you recommend for AA progression? I was thinking the following order.<br />
<br />
<br />
ND3<br />
Sturdiness 1<br />
CA3<br />
PD3<br />
LR5<br />
CS3<br />
PE<br />
ID5<br />
<br />
<br />
Does this seem like a valid progression? We don't plan on doing much raiding. After we hit mid 60's might head to WoS , etc for better exp. Is CS inferior to CA enough that i can validate going after LR5 before i even get CS3?<br />

<br />
levels are your friends. get them.</div></div><hr />

We were thinking of going to 65 before getting any aa. is that a bad idea? Pack Shrew so run3 is kinda a side thought</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">10-04-2004, 01:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If your goal is to get the most from your time, levels &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; AA's.  Gaining a level increases skill caps, hp's, resist rates, and many other things.  You will do more damage, and take less simply by leveling.  While there are valid reasons to do AA's before 70, and run3 probably still should be a priority to get earlier(run 3 never fades at a bad moment, unlike SoW/shrew), 90 % of the time, leveling is much more important than AA's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">10-04-2004, 01:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ahh, i thought by the way the thread was written you were going to AA at level 55.<br />
if anyhting, at least get RunSpeed3 soon. Than level to 65 or 66 ( i saw some decent reasonably_cheap items with req level 66 for sale in the bazaar that is really good stuff ) .. <br />
but yeah, level to 65 than finish up the aa's you mentioned than you'll be set. but i'd get RS3 ASAP. because faster indoor run speed for dungeons is sweet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">osserkon</div><div class="date">10-04-2004, 01:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Run 3 is always there. What if your pack shrew caster takes the night off? You need 6 in general anyways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dxkj21</div><div class="date">10-04-2004, 02:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">true, Will do Run3, then .. something. And then go for ND3</div></div><hr />

Put CA3 and LR5 at the top of the list.  Yes, HP is great and all, but not getting hit is far better than being able to take a hit.<br />
<br />
<br />
And yes, put AA aside and get lvl 65 asap.  It will do more for your hp than aa will at this point.</div></div><hr />
