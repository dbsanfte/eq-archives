<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Krassus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Here is the past 3 weeks of Coirnav spawns on Solusek Ro. Random Timer ? F$ck offf sony……….. <br />
We start on Friday waiting at 11pm ( hes due still and 3 days 6 hours would have been at 8pm ) 2:45 am EST we camp tired of waiting. He spawns Saturday 5am EST Euros wipe at 12pm EST. On to Tuesday - spawns at 6am on Tuesday not even the freaking 3 day mark, euros wipe to Coirnav 76%, We zone camp Friday at 6pm until almost 3am NO SPAWN spawns at 8am Saturday. Saturday 1:18pm EST Euros well Spanish guild wipes ( same one ) So hes due today ? He spawns today Tuesday 9am /GASP not at 7pm like 3 days 6 hours but spawns at 2 days and 19 hours !!!!1 HELL YES I LOVE NOT BEING IN TIME THANKS TO COIRNAV !!!!!<br />
<br />
Fix this bullshit already its ridiculous we cannot even get one attempt on the single mob holding us from getting into time, Its been 3 months + now that we have been wanting to attempt and got one try at 2am on a Saturday and another try at a decent hour. I don’t care what anyone says about random timer. Its not working on Sol Ro this guild is on their 15th try. We finally moved to Rathe after our second kill last night in about an hour and a half we only need Coirnav. There is nothing else to do and this BS sucks. I don’t blame them for killing it either I mean I would if I was euro, its Sony that needs to fix this shit or instance it or make it so they cant monopolize a spawn.<br />
<br />
This is the gayest of all timesink progression blocking mobs in the game</div></div><hr />

I'm a euro, with aussie, est, pst and another euro guild. They raid whenever they have to, if they want a mob badly enough. You appearently don't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Krassus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Chatja your in a aussie/euro guild i can see why you dont have a problem getting mobs. We've stayed up to 2am weeknights and 3am on weekends and beyond if you read my post. We all work, goto school or some like me both =x So i want it bad as we all do, but 2am on a weeknight to be up at 6am is about as far as well go. We all have been waiting every weekend as far as we can stay awake. They do the same thing but on top of their 19 hour timeframe advantage when they do what we do by staying up late its 19+ whatever extra they put in. My guild raids weekends at 11am (/hug Dima) and is willing to nut up and stay up late but the random timer is so so awesome it just happens to spawn at 5am or 5pm or during that euro time frame. <br />
<br />
American time - 8pm EST until 1am EST - or 5 hours window for mob to spawn for us<br />
<br />
Euro time - 1:01 am EST until 7:45pm EST a mob is theirs - almost 19 hours<br />
<br />
<br />
No matter what Euro Timeframe &gt; All. Now i see why some americans like Dima join Euro guilds !!!!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gnomb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I can imagine staying up on weekdays if the spawn is there but not if it is a 'possibility'.<br />
My old guilds first AHR kill happened around 4 am wednesday morning, i hit bed around 4.30 am and woke up at 7 am.<br />
I am a systemadministrator and that day was hell as you can imagine but still worth it to me.<br />
But would i have stayed if at 2 am or 3 am AHR wasnt up but supposed to spawn within the hour? I doubt it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Frax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Krassus, I'm sure more than a few people here understand what you mean, but really unless those other guilds give you a shot on their own accord, you have to make your own opportunity.  <br />

They will slip up and or get lazy at somepoint, everyone does.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Chatja ogre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">No, euro window isn't 19 hours p Allo ther guilds then yours have a 19 hour window.

It might not seem so bad if you have an asian guild to split it up but with only 2 major raid segments things are alot more lopsided, speaking from personal experience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Krassus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Tarkas knows from personal experience on Sol Ro, your either Euro or your not. It would rock if we had a pure PST or Asian guild killing Coirnav. As it stands now hes killed tuesdays 11am-2pm then wont spawn friday until sometime randomly 1am-9am or even later for past 3 weeks, then just repeat again. Weve been waiting on Fridays hopefully theyll get lazy or mess up the spawn time. All we need is Coirnav to get into time =x</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I don't understand.<br />
<br />
Really - They're willing to stay late, you aren't. Euros have jobs just like americans. They have school too.<br />
<br />
There's no &quot;euro time zone&quot; on elemental gods. The whole euro time zone complaints for the last 5 years were about patch mobs. Gods aren't patch mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Tarkas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I think the point is, under the old system (depop time+4-6hrs) you were guaranteed a spawn at least every 3 pops. Thats no longer the case with lobster and it goes back to the whole patch day time advantage brouhaha we've been dealing with for years.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Krassus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">/pats Tarkas on the back. Bingo<br />
<br />
with 4-6 hours wed be fine, at least one in 4 would be ours, thats at least a bone<br />
<br />
Euros DONT HAVE TO STAY UP. They get freaking 18 hours. Our Raid times start at 7 EST cause at 6:59 our 5 euro guilds are still clearing. They have from 1am on a normal night until 7pm whats the math ? 18 hours that’s 75% in their favor of raiding. <br />
<br />
Ok were gonna be hardcore now cause staying up till 3am on weekdays when hes due and 4-5am on weekends is not enough!!! <br />
<br />
How many nights you going to stay up with a real job + school and a GF ? I can do it once or twice like now a week np and just be a worthless zombie the next day. Its on a golden platter for other servers, bring us Asians to sol ro !!!!!!!!!!!!! Fuck instancing we need some Asians competing and pushing the spawn times all whacked out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Coray</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">If it's euros and you, then you should be able to get around half of the spawns if you know what you're doing, there is NO reason why you should go so long without chances if you know what you are doing.<br />
<br />
Elemental mobs (and gods) are pretty much all around 3 days +5-8 hours, which means that if say today some euro guild goes and kills or blows coirnav.  You can pretty reliably determine that on Saturday, you could stand a good chance of getting him up.  <br />
<br />
It isn't 100%, it's maybe 90% likely that he'll come up at a decent time, and in that regard euros have an advantage assuming there aren't pacific time zone guilds (which there isnt on a lot of servers), because anything that spawns after the US time window, all the way through the end of the european window, they can pick and choose.<br />
<br />
In essence they still have a huge advantage on most servers, but that doesn't mean you're as screwed as you seem to think.</div></div><hr />

We know what were doing, you just dont seem to know how to read or realize hes not 3 days and 6 hours. Its a rumor a guess or a myth or whatever you want to call it and it has nothing to do with incompetency or lack of want not being able to attempt him.<br />
<br />
Were watching and waiting and logging EVERY SINGLE time he is due and he is NOT 3 days +6-8 hours there is no possible way. Read my timeline posts.<br />
<br />
Last week he was ruined at 11am EST tuesday, he respawned at 5:27am EST SATURDAY now 3 days +6-8 hours would be friday night 5pm EST until 8pm EST.. what hes 3 days 6-8 hours ???? Thats 3 days18 hours and 27 minutes.<br />
<br />
Week before he was ruined Saturday at 2pm EST he repopped tuesday at like 10:17 am now Saturday from 2pm until tuesday 10:17 AM = 2 days and 19 hours. WTF is that  cause its sure as hell not 3 days. Its a recurring pattern.<br />
<br />
Weve been watching this turkey for 3 months now like hawks and like i said waiting up during the week and on weekends. Letting ourselves sleep 2 hours before full days lately. Its just frustrating as shit being one mob away and waiting for scraps.<br />
<br />
Im gonna have my PHd in Coirnav statistics and probabilities soon =xxx</div></div><hr />

We have 4 euro + 2 one mob away from EPs, 3 american + 2 alos one mob from EPs. So ATM right now today we have 7 EP guilds 4 of which are euro and kill coirnav. 3 american also.</div></div><hr />

Sure, I mean who am I to speak, it's not like my guild is in the plane of time, and it's not like last week they got all four elemental gods despite heavy competition.  It was ridiculous, I said we'd do Fennin Ro this day and although we had to wait an hour, he magically spawned just about when I said he would, and then a few days later, I told everyone we would be doing Coirnav, and guess what was up and waiting for us despite european guilds trying to get him?<br />
<br />
And I even said it's not 100% chance that things will come up at a great time, sometimes yes you'll have it spawn out of your window, but it's FAR from the rule.<br />
<br />
Instead of talking, maybe you should shutup and listen for a minute.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Kilaara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Krassus is right and also wrong.<br />
<br />
Euro Guilds also have a small raidtimezone between 18.00 and 01.00 european time. Maybe some can start a bit earlier and can hang out a bit later but lots of ppl. are also working.<br />
<br />
But I think what Krassus means is: When the Mob spawns after the american guilds are going to sleep there is no one up to kill him until the european start killing him. So when the european can kill him early a day ( 18.00 euroean time ) they have a big chance for the next one, cause each spawn time up to 3 days 6 hours is a european one.<br />
<br />
And they all run for the mob on solusek ro. Also the european rush each other. That means that the euros do not kill him for that the americans cant kill him, they kill him so that the other euros will not get a try. Triadica and DB are not really a target for blocking in any form, cause the euros block each other in every way. <br />
<br />
We leaved the server cause of that stuff, made agreements with the other higher guilds on KD, and live now in peace and in time <br />
:D . Servermove was the best thing we could have done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Buuhmann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Assume only European and US guilds. Assume each guild can mobilize an effective force from 6p their time till midnight their time in order to kill a mob. Midnight Euro time is 6p EST. Therefore any mob that spawns from 6pm EST to midnight of the American guild (est or pst) will go to the american guild, any mob that spawns after midnight will be caught the next day by the European guild. 6/24 hours that a mob may spawn belong to a EST only guild 9/24 hours will be long to an american gulid in general, the reamining 15-18 hours is all European timezone advantage.<br />
<br />
thats the point. <br />
Instancing is the magic word. <br />
<br />
*** [solro related:] ***<br />
<br />
Btw euros are not blocking US guilds at all on solro. Atm WC needs one coirnav to finish their time flags and odisea is working hard on entering potime (by *any* means...). Odisea wiped last several times -&gt; blow. They need one more coir kill now, WC needs one more... lets see what happens after these. BoR is clearing PoTime within 2 days anyway and US guilds are not interfering with Euro guilds in time... (except fucked up instances etc)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Zaboo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">EverQuest was *not* designed for more than 1 high-level guild per server.  Think about it for a second.  In a multi-guild environment, why have &gt;single&lt; spawn road-blocks to the end game like Trakanon, Emperor Ssra, Rallos Zek?  Sure, it makes for a good story content-wise, but it creates Player vs Player competition in a Player vs Environment game.  Games are either PvP or PvE.  EQ has both concepts and that is where the rub is, but instead of being able to deal directly with other players (PK PK PK), players can't do jack but wait around getting more and more frustrated.<br />
<br />
Instancing is where it's at.  I hope the entire progression path in GoD is instanced.  Players should be able to enjoy content at their own pace and skill level.  If I wanted PvP, I would play Quake.<br />
<br />
Without an Asian guild, Euro's have a huge advantage as stated above.  Even though their raiding window may be the same as American guilds, they have a SPAWN window (after U.S. guilds log) AND a separate raiding window.  U.S. guilds have don't have the spawn window.<br />
<br />
Oh, lol @ &quot;wanting&quot; a spawn bad enough to pay SoE $13.95/month to sit on  your butt looking at the screen hoping for a spawn.  Yeah, I've done it too, but that's not fun nor how the game is supposed to be played.  It's a job that has to be done to progress on crowded servers.  Like I said before, the game was designed for only 1 raiding guild per server.<br />

I don't understand.<br />

Really - They're willing to stay late, you aren't. Euros have jobs just like americans. They have school too.<br />
<br />
There's no &quot;euro time zone&quot; on elemental gods. The whole euro time zone complaints for the last 5 years were about patch mobs. Gods aren't patch mobs.  <br />
<br />
Sorry not quite true Raaj as posted on the other thread:<br />
<br />
Assume only European and US guilds. Assume each guild can mobilize an effective force from 6p their time till midnight their time in order to kill a mob. Midnight Euro time is 6p EST. Therefore any mob that spawns from 6pm EST to midnight of the American guild (est or pst) will go to the american guild, any mob that spawns after midnight will be caught the next day by the European guild. 6/24 hours that a mob may spawn belong to a EST only guild 9/24 hours will be long to an american gulid in general, the reamining 15-18 hours is all European timezone advantage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Gobsmash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Any mob that pops till 2-3 in the morning can be killed by north american guilds virtualy uncontested by any other guild. That one guild may not be intersted or able to stay late but I would bet that there is some guild that will.<br />
<br />
PS: if you were to say north american guilds play time a more correct time would be 6 atlantic till midnight or 1-2 am PST a total time 11-12 hours. Presuming only 8 uncontested hours for both guild from NA and EU adding a asian guild does nothing to your 1/3 of a day uncontested, sure it adds to mobs the EU guilds can kill but them progressing on mobs would have gona to another guild does not help you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>friss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Coirnav should be like the other gods that you can retry again in a short time if you fail.  The fact it can be blown makes it much harder for other guilds to get a chance at learning this raid.  And lets face it, most guilds need to learn how to win this event.<br />
<br />
As for staying up late sure most guilds can talk most of the people to push and stay up late waiting for a spawn. The trouble is the few that have to log, but again to beat coirnav for the first time most guilds need a large force with everyone log on.</div></div><hr />
