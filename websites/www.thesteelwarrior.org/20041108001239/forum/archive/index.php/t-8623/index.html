<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>HiPPoMenes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all,  I am a 65 warr and currently have 11 aa's but they seem to be coming along nicely in  BoT.  I have run 3 and regen 3 and working on the hp one in class... cant remember name ;p  I was wondering what to do after i finish it? I know the combat agilty and stability look very helpfull but im wondering is there a nice, quick way to get Marshall tag.  Or should i just finish this hp one and move along to the stability and agility because they are that detrimental.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If any warrior gets his/her marshall title before 150-200 aa count they need to be drug out back and pistol-whippd  :cool: <br />
<br />
Get all your defensives first<br />
combat stability3 ..... 12aa<br />
combat agility3 ........ 12 aa<br />
physical enhancement .... 5 aa (works towards marshall)<br />
lightning reflexes5 ..... 15 aa<br />
innate defense5 ...... 15 aa<br />
<br />
Then get either hp aa's, AE taunt, or Proccing aa<br />
natural durability3 .... 12 aa<br />
planar durability3 ... 9aa<br />
weapon affinity5 .... 30aa<br />
sturdiness5 .... 60aa if you do it all<br />
AE taunt .... 5aa  (works towards marshall)<br />
<br />
<br />
I'd highly reccomend getting stalwart endurance capped as well first.<br />
<br />
<br />
Marshall takes 24 aa if i'm not mistaken ... maybe more.  Class aa's really arent all that nice, so until you have all your defensive aas done and want to start working offensives and toy aa's (like flurry) i'd leave Marshall alone.  It's not worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>bargran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i would say ND3 , aeTaunt, then max defensive AAs.<br />
<br />
But i second the previous poster in that you should have a lot of AAs before thinking about your class title (i think i was marshall when i got around 170 AA, and it was before GoD ones).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Frostpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">/agree with above posters...124aa here and no Marshall tag in sight. Might be something I never see with OoW coming out so soon, hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">112 AAs here and figure I will be over 200 before I get Marshall. Ambidex is likely to be the next class AA I get, but that will probably come after things like WA3, Sturdiness 1-2 and some of the PoP tanking AAs (tac mastersy, the stun resistance...) and somewhere in there I have to fit in Planar Power.<br />
<br />
And of course OoW provides even more basic tanking AAs in CA/CS 9+. I just hated grinding those the first two times, I can't see how I will like it any more a 3rd time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Quick way to marshall?<br />
<br />
Run 3<br />

ND3<br />
AE taunt<br />
PE<br />
Ambidex<br />
Rampage<br />
<br />
Fuck everyone else.  Marshall is badass, if you want it, get it.  It's not like you can't get any more AA's after you get it.  I was a Marshall pretty quick after Luclin came out, and I'm still in the vast minority of them on my server, and I wouldn't change anything if I had to do it over again.  Veteren is cool....for about 24 AA's and then I got sick of having the same damned title that everyone else does.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">AE Taunt, PE, then Flurry works too, especially if you're not dual wielding, and if you're pre Time, 2H weapons are probably a better option anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I hated getting Marshall.Happened by accident one day hehe.Sounds more like a paper pusher with plastic toys than a tank...Veteran was more to my liking.Now that the crazy folks made me gl/rl I guess it kinda fits.Would rather just tank tho. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, as far as quickest goes, that only works if you're going CF3 too instead of ND3, and I think we all can agree that's a much bigger waste of some points than just Ambidex and Rampage :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Rampage seems like an absolutely useless AA though, whereas CF3 at least equates to some damage.  If you don't have an Earthshaker you can't even use Rampage as a toy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am guessing you do not own an earthshaker sir :)<br />
<br />
I have seen some bad pulls result in some BADASS trains, and with 2 rampage capable warriors in the group, we get the situation back under control really quick.<br />
<br />
Plus with the Rampage XP stuff that people are doing, I don't regret having rampage during Luclin and buying an earthshaker for 800pp one fucking bit, especially since I remember a post from one person dissing the Marshall title in this thread spending a copious amount of plat on his :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>unclebong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">A lot of folks like to take the angle expressed in this thread that you should be shot for getting your Marshall title before you have 200aa.  FUCK THEM.  They aint playing your toon, have as much fun as possible with it.<br />
<br />
Besides showing off with the earthshaker, rampage can be useful.  Puller brings 5 mobs to camp, rampage is a nice lil AE you can whip out and at least swing on the entire train and get on their hatelists w/o blowing AETaunt.<br />
<br />
Anyway, can always do ambidex instead of ramp for the Marshall title. Its a few more aa's but it'll keep the snobs off your back heh ;p<br />
<br />
That being said, PD3, PE, LR5, and ID5 are the core tanking aa's (hps avoidance mitigation)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Friedrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">If the title is more important to you than your tanking abilities then by all means, get the title asap.  It's your toon, play them the way you want.  This way you can actually work on aa's that will make you a better tank after that.  I got my Marshall title around the 170ish mark (pre GoD) and it was sooner than I should have from a tanking standpoint but I don't regret it.  Everyone has a little vanity in them.<br />
<br />
Just keep one thing in mind though, if you rush to get Marshall at 60 aa's, don't be suprised if a lot of Veterans tank circles around you.  I watched some warriors in my guild get the Marshall title early and they didn't survive the named mobs as well as the Veterans that went tanking aa's first.  Sure we all admired their corpses with the cool title as we were rezing and doing loot though :)<br />

In this day and age of CA/LR hysteria, there's not going to be that much difference.  Most people will go CA3 for 12 points, and then only get to LR4 in the time it takes you to get to marshall.  Obviously some people are different, but I click on a lot of magelos around here with no CS at all and points in LR.  That's not efficient either, and you don't even get a new title for wasting your points :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>unclebong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">oh there is a remarkable difference between LR1 to LR5 and ID1 to ID5.  They are way way way way worth the time and effort to get.  But that shouldnt be a reason to stop you from getting your class title if that is what you want.  Just bear in mind you will get out tanked BIG time by the folks who do have LR5/ID5</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I bought rampage for my earthshaker, but I have yet to actually kill anything that way I think hehe.  Despite that fact, I don't regret buying rampage at all.  I use it quite a bit with no earthshaker equipped.  It's good for getting a little aggro on multiple mobs after ae taunt (if you proc EB on your rampage round it's a major bonus).  Also good for giving enchanters something to do if you think they're too busy running their mouth :)<br />
<br />
For those of you predicting dire consequences on those who spend 14 points out of order to get their marshall title because they want it, see the smiley  --&gt;:rolleyes:&lt;--<br />

I had 180 something AA when I got marshall, but I wouldn't be any worse off today had I gotten it earlier.</div></div><hr />

ID5 = 5% mitigation.  IE :CS 2.  For 15 points<br />
LR5 = 5% avoidance.  IE : CA 2.  For 15 points.<br />
<br />
Say what you want, but they return on investment greatly diminishes in the PoP AA's.</div></div><hr />

2 questions for ya Haass (not picking fights just wondering) Where'd you get those numbers? and how is the math done exactly (is the % bonus added together and used or is the CA computed then the LR bonus applied to that value?)<br />
<br />
Oh yea, and in simple terms, w/o LR5 ID5 and PD3 you will splat much more than someone w/ them.  Especially against boss mob types.</div></div><hr />

That about sums it up ... <br />
<br />
As a warrior your only job is to take damage and hold aggro.  The character is yours to do as you see fit, but Fried was right about the tanking situation.  You may have your marshall title, but you'll still suck at what you're intended to do.<br />
<br />
It's foolish imo ... like telling a ranger it's ok to  cap out all up close melee offensive  aas before touching archery aa's.<br />

<br />
I understand that a lot of people don't know why I know certain facts, and it's because I've been reading this board all day every day for so damned long that I've basically seen everything come and go in the last few years.  I don't always remember names, or what section they were in, or even if they were done by this board or linked from some other board, so the best I can tell ya is this.<br />
<br />
Awhile back, someone did some parses and came up with the accepted value for  ID and LR to be about 1% per rank, so if you have an extra 10% after CA, and CS, ID and LR add another 5%, which stack with CA and CS, thus making the total avoidance and mitigation modification 15% for each.<br />
<br />
You can probably do some snooping around and find them, but I don't know.  I recently tried to look back thru my posts and only found about 500, and I know there's been more than that, so I don't know if the board clips them off after awhile or what.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>unclebong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I dig man, thanks.<br />
<br />
BTW, dont forget about PE, thats an extra 2% on top of the 10% bonus from CA/CS/ND (CF too?)  So in the end its a 17% total bonus (if they are added together and used)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I recently tried to look back thru my posts and only found about 500, and I know there's been more than that, so I don't know if the board clips them off after awhile or what.<br />

I think 500 is just the maximum results you can get from a search.  All the posts since the jump from EZBoard are still here.<br />

All defensive, HP and WA maxxed prior to going DPS (i went flurry, ferocity and almost finished w. punishing blade now).  The difference between my tanking ability through those AA's as compared to before is enormous.<br />

I keep seeing people suggest PE after cS1, CA1 and ND1, but you can't do that.  I know it's been a while since most had to worry about this stuff, but remember you gotta have 12 archetype aa's before you can get into class.<br />
<br />
Not saying this to be nitpicky, but I've seen it 3 or 4 times in the last few days between this board and my guild board and wanna make everyone remembers this so we don't confuse unintentionally (intentional confusion is perfectly fine however, and lots of fun).</div></div><hr />

<br />
   And after all the months of grinding AA's and exp, I had like 40 AA when I was still Lvl 60, I decided it was time to get something fun like Rampage.<br />
<br />
   And since learning about the FG callers and spending a few nights there even filling up the group with guildies to PL ive made back the AA. Not to mention all the leadership points and even with spending 1100 plat per round on the kegs, I have more then made that back selling the named loot in Bazaar</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>wudedorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">I still do not have marshall title myself and dont anticipate getting it anytime soon with OoW coming out with more defensive AA's</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Harthina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">In the long run, true....it's not going to matter when you get Marshall...because sooner or latter, if you keep playing, you're going to have a gazillion AAs.  Titles are cool...but a title in and of itself doesn't actually mean jack. (Maybe with the new custom AAs coming out with OoW that will change somewhat, we'll see.) <br />
<br />
My personal opinion on the matter is...I want to be the best tank I can be NOW, and to hell with titles.  Everytime I think about going for the title, I take a look through my AA list and really try to think about which AAs will be most useful for me given how I play and where.  For me, that meant making sure I got my defensive and HP AAs in as fast as I could, along with things like Weapon Affinity to help me gain aggro faster.  Then again, I'm almost always main tank in a group situation, and often in the tank line-up on raids as well.  If, however, you were not likely to be MT at any point in a raid, and you prefer to fill a DPS slot than a tank slot in a group then perhaps getting those Marshall AAs would be more useful to you.  Of course, if you want a DPS slot you're playing the wrong class, IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Tinguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">No matter what our role is not on par with the dps classes.  We can spend a ton of xp in offensive aa and compaired to just about anything else with the same aa we wont do the damage.  So why not put the aa where we are good at, taking a beating.  I was 180+ aa before I got the marshal title and that was too soon in my opinon.  People expect to get a mega tank out of a marshal title, they assume you can take a beating in an ldon hard or a gates trial.  If you cant then you may find yourself lossing a rep.  <br />

If you hunt with guildies and friends all the time then who cares, tailor your aa to your group needs, or to what you feel like at the time.  In pick up groups however expect some flak if your a marshal and cant hit 8K hp.</div></div><hr />
