Thanks for your help... i of course /petitioned it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Launea</div><div class="date">09-28-2004, 01:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">either way, the ore spawns every 30 minutes next to the noc near the Bloodfields zone. I have watched this and timed it personally, it spawns like clockwork and is always the ore spawn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zondelfinni</div><div class="date">09-28-2004, 03:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anychance you have a /loc of the 30 min spawn? FYI i jus got a Ore and tried the turn in again, this time the NPC ate my stuff... Said hold on while i work on this in the forge, wait a min.... So i waited, and nothin happened...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khabok</div><div class="date">09-29-2004, 03:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did you give Korbuk the ore before you brought it to the smith  ?  Not sure since I didnt check the numbers on them but the ore he returns may be a different item then the one you pick up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">09-29-2004, 03:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In a related issue - it's possible to get the Energy Recepter, find the Borer and not see the ore drop. The Borer was trained by another player to the Bloodfields zone after I spawned him and I  watched him Invis for over an hour and then checked each of the Ore drop locations for another hour to no avail.<br />
<br />
If this happns to you and you have to log. Don't panic even though the Energy Recepter is No Rent. Apparently if you have the needed flags merely finding the Ore allows you to continue with subesequent steps in the quest - no need to forage pages over again, etc.<br />

I actually had an ore already, when I got the Energy Receptor I just handed in the ore immediately without walking around the zone.  Korbuk was happy with the ore and sent me onto the next step.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khabok</div><div class="date">09-30-2004, 05:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I collected my ore well collecting poages to. Just to be safe I sat around for a while with the energy receptor on cursor until the message came up about what direction the borer was, then went and gave Korbuk my ore but ive still never seen the Blackfall Borer</div></div><hr />

On a sidenote, I had to give more water than specified. I think it took like 7 or 8 before I got the message about not being thirsty any more. Not sure why, but I then handed in the items and it worked fine. Luckily I had bought a full stack in case I forgot and drank some before I got a chance to go do turn in.</div></div><hr />
