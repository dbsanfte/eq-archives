<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spoon</div><div class="date">03-30-2004, 09:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all,<br />
<br />
I have been playing EQ for a few months (great game) and my first char I ever created was a woodelf warrior.  Lots of people say that these are not particularly that good and I have since looked at other warrior types and on the face of it I would agree.  Trouble is I like him, he looks kinda cool and I originally was inspired to create him because I am a fan of LOTR movies.  Anyhow he's now level 44 and as and experiment I decide to create and Ogre Warrior as they have massive starting stats to try and compare the two.  I was just wondering is there anyone out there with experience of Woodelf warriors or any warrior that could giveme their view? Are there any bonus modifiers for playing Woodelfs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ayida</div><div class="date">03-30-2004, 09:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Most of the nice things about playing a woodelf warrior are intangibles.<br />
<br />
It mostly makes a difference early.  At low levels, the Ogre has the advantage on stats and stuff.  By the time you're 65 with 180 AAs, there ain't much difference.<br />
<br />
The major lasting advantage of being an Ogre is that you can't be stunned from the front, which doesn't suck. <br />
<br />
The major lasting advantage of being a wood elf (up to now, don't know what new engine will be like) is that you corner well, and ogres have sucked at cornering now for quite some time - basically you need an illusion to be a gnome or a woodelf or something (ironic, eh).<br />
<br />
My advice is play what makes you happy, because otherwise you'll burn out and leave.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spoon</div><div class="date">03-30-2004, 09:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">so what do you mean by cornering??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ealsur Helevorn</div><div class="date">03-30-2004, 09:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Woodelves get hide and sneak I think, can save your butt many times I bet :)<br />
<br />
I play a Half Elf, my starting stats weren't like an Ogre or a Barb, but I didnt mind much, in the end it's all about having fun the way you want to, stats can be buffed, even the big races stun resist can be obtained via an AA (Stalwart Endurance)... besides elven warriors have the looks on their side ;)<br />
<br />
Cornering means, in a raid situation, to put your back on a corner, the mob beating on you and the rest of the raid beating on the mob's ass, basically.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So what tips and advice could you give about being a warrior?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greyslayer</div><div class="date">03-30-2004, 10:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah don't let anyone tell you that you can't be a woodelf sure they don't start with as high as stats as most other races.  Stats mean nothing once you get high enough you can get buffs for them all besides on my server one the of the best warriors on the server is a Wood Elf.  They also IMO look the best in armor I like how it's all shiny.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Honestly, there's no major differences between the races.  Even the stat differences level out when you get higher level, and they don't really do much for you anyway.  If you like your warrior there's no reason not to keep playing him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">03-30-2004, 11:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Race doesnt matter at the higher end of the game, but if you're gonna be a casual, nonraiding sort of tank, some races do have nice advantages.  Large races typically have better starting str/sta and racial slam, ogres have frontal stun immunity and trolls have regen.  Iksar have regen and an AC bonus, gnomes can tinker,etc, etc.<br />
If I were starting over I'd probably stick with Tribunal worshipping Barbarian, otherwise I'd be something that could worship RZ.  All that having been said, if you like your treehuggin warrior, that's what's important.  Gear is the great equalizer.  And if you're already lvl 44 you could probably be well into your 50's or 60's in the same time it would take to level another warrior up to the level you are now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Das_bert</div><div class="date">03-30-2004, 11:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I chose to play a froglok warrior, so many people said that I should be an ogre for stats and such but now that I am 65 with a few buffs all melee stats are 280.  I like the little bonuses about frogs, ultravision, extra lung capacity, and higher than normal swimming.  All good things.  Only thing I didnt like was I could not worship RZ, but oh well.  Mith mar aint to bad the heraldic is mainly set up for pally's and clerics, still not bad.  Not as good as FH, but I enjoy playing my warrior.   And alot of trolls give me hassles sometimes.  long story short play what you like, and the game will be fun instead of a job.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i have to disagree however that wood elves look like samurai in plate.  they only adapted the breast plate in the 1800 when europe began to influence the japanese culture, and even then it was just a chest protector.  the rest of their armor was either leather or chain scales.<br />
<br />
i wish eq had a samurai class, id be a wood elf samurai =)</div></div><hr />

Play what you think will be fun (RP / looks), for you that is probably wood elf- it will make you happiest in the end.<br />

Stats will be evened up via gear/aa/buffs, so go for what race you ENJOY.  Hide and Forage were of some use when I was leveling up.</div></div><hr />

Back then it was hard to get max stats, so a wood elf would have less HP's then a orge, but they still seemed to find it easy to win toe to toe duels, against tanks with the same equipment.<br />
<br />
About the only base stat that woodelf warriors had higher then other tanks was AGI, plus when this game first came out a lot of tanks did put more points into AGI.   As far as I know nobody has every did any parse to see if base AGI might effect avoidance AC, but that might explain why woodelf were good at toe to toe duels.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I remember when I rolled him up, you still got those messages saying how difficult the character would be to play. Half-elf warrior came up as moderately difficult, or something like that. And that's been a hell of a lot of fun. Your race gives you a set of advantages and disadvantages. The fun part is figuring out how to maximize the former and overcome the latter.<br />
<br />
The bottom line is picking a combination of race and class that stimulates your imagination and keeps you coming back to the game with a smile on your face.<br />

Have fun,<br />

<br />
<br />
Basically the size of your character can avoid you from properly fitting into a corner.  Just like with a kitty cat warrior, their tails can get in the way.<br />
<br />
I have been a wood elf warrior since wood elf warriors weren't popular (back in 99).   Race does not matter in higher levels at all.  The only problem I see is the twinking factor and that wood elf cultural is no where near as good as Fierce Heraldic.  But all in the end it works out well.  I do not feel I am lacking at all due to my race.<br />
<br />
Play what you enjoy.  After all we are all here to have fun!</div></div><hr />

But once you get 65 with some aa's and decent gear it really doesnt make that big of difference.<br />
<br />
The best part of all is i never had to look at that ugly ogre at the log in screeen all the time.<br />
<br />
And it was way cooler to be a WE warrior before that crown came about now everyone and their brother walks around in WE illusion.<br />

<br />
Best thing about that set up is that I dyed all my armor green green except the pants which I dyed purple. <br />
<br />
So it gives the &quot;hulk&quot; appearance. Pretty cool.<br />
<br />
So now I have the wood elf thing so I can be mild mannered Bruce Banner until someone makes me angry...<br />

Pretty gay I know, but its fun.</div></div><hr />
