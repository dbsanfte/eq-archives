<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">no</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sivok Kovis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">they should change that =\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Best thread in SW history!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Raychael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">LMAO Jackle</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">you guys wanted to be agnostic or whatever for certain faction benefits IF it's such a big deal re run but lets NOT start another one of these threads.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sivok Kovis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Did I miss something, what r u talking about?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Braeorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Lets be reasonable when we say 'fug it, yer stuck with your choices you made at lvl 1'. Its a religion and as such you should be able to change it. I wouldn't care if it was a difficult thing to do as faction means little now with pok, SH, bazaar -- but for deity gear it'd be worth it. Besides those zones, you really don't need to travel to cities except for the odd quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sivok Kovis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It is for armor that I ask, My bard could wear same armor as my war had I thought of this over a year ago, but alas I did not, now i have to buy a whole nother suit /cry.<br />
<br />
Other than that I could care less, was more curious than anything as I did not think it could be done. Wanted to verify.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Casppur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">You know thats all fine and dandy about choosing Agnostic at start up...But as a Cat warrior i dont get a choice at start up.  Believe me i would choose a deity if i could now.  (and no i dont want to start over)  Darn SOE and the monkies that make their decisions. <br />
<br />
thanks<br />
Casppur</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Donnel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Haven't been here in awhile, so I thought I would contribute.<br />
<br />
Then I thought better of it, and just attached this picture.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Penny Arcade...so pwn</div></div><hr />

<br />
He might could work something out for you.<br />
<br />
He's a good friend of mine. All he needs is a time to meet you somewhere and make a screenshot (he would make a char on your server obviously)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Ghaok Ogrady</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Your so right Dobbo ...as an agnostic Oggah warrior i got so many faction benefits that they totally outweigh the screwing verant is giving us agnostic warrs now. <br />
I picked agnostic because it didnt matter... couple years later verant decides it does.<br />
You dont see the problem with that?<br />
Ghaok Ogrady</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Varf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">they need to make some really long a$s time consuming solo'able quest to change yer diety.<br />
