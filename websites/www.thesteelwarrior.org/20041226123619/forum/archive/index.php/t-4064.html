Uhh...  I need to start checking the links rather than click on shit at random.  Thanks for making my stomach churn...  <br />

May want to issue some warning to the faint hearted :)<br />

Issue a warning? He's about to have his account deleted. There's simply no need for that crap (no pun intended). DO NOT CLICK ON THOSE LINKS<br />

Say goodbye...</div></div><hr />

The first one is the dude you see everywhere, the second is the really fat lady.<br />
<br />
That's just by reading the properties :p<br />

<br />
I did not make this post, nor have I given out my password to anyone.  I would like to think that in 322 posts and over a year of posting here and on old steelwarrior that I may be given the benefit of the doubt in this regard.<br />
<br />
I'd like to speak with Raaj and Shikarii about this please so that we may remedy the situation, I have sent private messages to both of you, so please check it and get back to me asap, because this is silly and embarassing.<br />

I'm gonna go with that one.  I don't see eye to eye with Grendon, but lets be serious, there isn't anything that guy has posted that is even remotely close to this kind of bullshit.  Someone got ahold of his board info somehow and got him banned for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pilerboy</div><div class="date">11-05-2003, 06:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks mate, I appreciate it.<br />
<br />
I think I have figured out the source of the problem; one day I logged on from a public library, and, to my dismay, they seem to have had cookies enabled.  As soon as I realized what was going on I drove to library and checked it out, and sure enough as soon as I went to steelwarrior site it had me autologged in....... BONEHEAD me.  Still wish there weren't such dicks in the world that would screw with someone like that.<br />
<br />
Oh well, lesson learned.. always hit the log out box :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grendonbb</div><div class="date">11-05-2003, 06:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Woot!  Thanks Raaj.<br />
<br />
Sorry bout the crap guys, learn from my mistake /nod click the log out box heh.</div></div><hr />
