<br />
lets say im using a luggold dagger think its 6/18 with 3 bonus *for my level*<br />
<br />
what effect does the bonus damage have on the weapon? *thinking max hit of 6+6+3 before strength modifier maybe*<br />
<br />
does the bonus only work with main hand or does it work with both?<br />
<br />
has anyone figured out a somewhat basic table (kind like Lucy has for damage bonus) for Strength modifier? *heard years ago that weapon type made a difference on the modifier, aka piercing didnt get a modifier whereas 2hs got the biggest one*<br />
<br />
looking at C Realms *ok you can stop giggling now* it states that piercing has a level cap of 240 instead of 250 like the other 4 kinds of damage, anyone ever figure out why or has this been changed to 250 for all 5?<br />
<br />
thx for any info</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">weoden</div><div class="date">05-29-2003, 02:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">alright, no one made a responce so I will try to give this a shot.  First, keep reading this forum and you will pick up lots of ideas about ac/attack/strength/weapons skil etc.<br />
<br />
Anyway. max damage is based on level and strength(I think).  Your level wil cap your damage the most.  Next, the (2*damage + bonus)/delay/100 is a rough approximate I use for estimating which weapon can do the most dps. <br />
<br />
Finally, attack rating will determine your average dps... that and weapons skill and level.  Now, your weapons skill directly relates to your attack rating.  There are other contributing factors such as the mobs ac and your strength(it raises attack rating) and buffs.<br />
<br />
So, what benefit does the bonus give?  Simply, its damage added on to every hit.<br />
<br />
now, 2handers have a much larger bonus and the 2handers available at the high end have very nice dps.</div></div><hr />
