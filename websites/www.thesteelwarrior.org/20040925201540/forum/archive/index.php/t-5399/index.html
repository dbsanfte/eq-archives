<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Darkeeper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I recently collected all the items to complete the Green Scale quest in NRo.  I triggered the quest by handing in a flask of water, followed the text, handed in the red scale, and preceded to get the &quot;Verells box of Potions&quot; from Cogswinn so that I could do the combine.  The container has 1 Slot ...  I petitioned and /bug reported it but I was wondering if anyone else has seen this.   <br />
Alla shows the container to have a capacity of 4 which makes sense seeing that you need to combine 3 items in it.  <br />
Any feedback would be great...<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">A one-slot container?  That's a bit odd, never heard of a one-slot container.  Didn't think they could make a container with an odd number of slots anyways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Darkeeper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes... I will try to screenshot it tonight...  <br />
It has the right name for the container and a &quot;combine&quot; button but only 1 slot :)<br />
I linked it to a GM and he saw because on the item info it says &quot;capacity 1&quot;<br />
He simply told me to /bug it and wait to them to check it out.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>wraq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I thought something was a bit buggy when I did mine also. I think you turn that back into the guy but couldn't say for certain. I almost logged because I was mad then figured I would just try to hand it back to him. Not sure if you would want to chance it. I never went back to read the text to see exactly what had happened.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Darkeeper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for the input Wraq... <br />
So you are saying that you recieved the 1 slot container also?<br />
If I were you, I would not hand it in... That is not how the quest is supposed to work and you run the risk of losing the item and possibly your Red Scale...  I am hoping they will fix the bug and at that time if you have the container in your inventory they will fix it... But if you dont have it im sure they will tell us that we are SOL...<br />
If you wouldnt mind, maybe petition and /bug report it also.  If they get several /bug reports on this they are more likely to fix it for us.<br />
I am willing to wait a while and see what happens but if there are any other info or experiences that people are having with this I would like to know.<br />
<br />
Thank you<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>wraq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think I did receive a 1 slot container that I had to hand in. Will try to read through the quest and see what it might have been he handed out. I think when I turned mine in he gave me the fractured scale. Will see if I can find anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>wraq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I looked through and couldn't see it. I do remember this being a pain. When you read through the quest I am not seeing where he actually hands you the fractured scale but he does. Have you recieved the fractured scale yet? He will change the fractured to grey once you do everything then you hand him the grey one and he will make it green. I should have payed more attention and not just handed items in, there seems to be a few parts missing from the quest. I did get mine, I think I had to hand it in to get the fractured scale. Sorry not more help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Darkeeper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hmmmm...<br />
<br />
I didnt get the fractured scale yet but here is what happened:<br />
<br />
I collected the items to make the adhesive (Glue Powder) and made it... I collected the items to make the brew (Deep Barley Brew) and made it... <br />
1.) I went to Cogswinn and triggered the quest with the flask of water.<br />
2.) Followed the text and proceeded to hand him the red scale.<br />
3.)  I got the Good/Bad news text and continued to follow the text.  He handed me the &quot;Potion Vial&quot; and the &quot;Verrells Box Of Potions&quot;(but it only has 1 slot instead of 4) <br />
<br />
this step...<br />
<br />
You say, 'What adhesive?' <br />
<br />
Verrell Cogswin says 'In order to make this special adhesive you will need to combine some [glue powder] and some [Deep Barley Brew] in this container with this special vial. Return the result to me and I should be able to fix the scale, but please try to hurry I have to meet my brother Pellillo <br />
Cogswin at the wizard platform so he can take me home.' <br />
<br />
Receive a four-slot container: Verrell's Box of Potions .. and a Potion Vial. <br />
<br />
I am pretty sure, going bye the quest posted on Alla, that it is impossible for me to complete this due to the 1 slot container.<br />
<br />
I think the part you are talking about with the broken scale is after you hand him the Adhesive (which is made from combining the Glue Powder, Deep Barely Brew, Potion Vial in the 4slot container) he gives you the broken scale and the adhesive back.<br />
Then you combine them for the grey dragon scale and hand that in for the Green Dragon scale...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Caelidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I started doin this when I first heard about it, and I got the 4-slot container, but as my epic would be completed just to say I did it, I gave it a low priority.  And when I looked at it agian yesterday I noticed it was only 1 slot.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Darkeeper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thanks for the info Caelidar... This pretty much confirms that it is a bug.   We are on different servers, plus you at one time had the correct 4 slot and now it changed to the 1 slot. <br />
I hope they fix it soon...<br />
Not sure if you guys want to be bothered by this but I think it would help if more people /bug it.  If you have the time to do so that would be great.<br />
<br />
Thanks for all the input and I will let you know if/when it is fixed on my end.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>wraq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I think Alla is missing part of the quest story line around the fractured scale. It shows him handing you the other parts but not the fractured scales. That was the part when I thought it was bugged when I did mine. Your right about the container. I should have logged the text when I did mine. I got it but there is a step in there I think Alla is missing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Darkeeper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Still not fixed... I have /buged it a few times and now its a waiting game... I am surprised that there are not more people having this problem.  I guess there is not a lot of people working the quest.  Very disappointed though,  I would think its an easy fix but with GoD im sure they are not paying attention to the /bug reports.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>wraq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I would try handing him back the single slot box. I don't think he will keep it if it doesn't work. At most your still caught in the bug and have to wait on a response anyways. I should have logged the text when I did this quest. I know Ala is missing a portion of it but can't remember just how the text went.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Alaek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">As of today, 2/13/04, the quest container HAS BEEN FIXED and is now 4 slots once again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Darkeeper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Yes I noticed that also today... Problem is that it is still broken.  I cannot combine the &quot;Potion Vial&quot;, &quot;Deep Barley Brew&quot;, and the &quot;Glue Powder&quot; in the box.  I get the message that You cannot combine these items in this container type.<br />
Still broken unless I am missing something...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Jenswar Keelmore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I am trying the same quest..my problem is I have all the stuff but can't find the NPC. I have walked all over NRO trying to find him and he isn't there...I have been there a couple days now wondering around having tracker types come and help...I play on Cazic-Thule and don't think we have a GM assigned to our server at all because I have petitioned and /bugged and gotten no response...I am tired of sitting in the desert...I should have just camped Serverlious in EJ would probably had better luck...at least he might have spawned already LOL! <br />
<br />
/RANT OFF!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Darkeeper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">He is in NRo at the totem (neg 820, neg 480).  I have noticed that he in NOT always up.  I do not know if this is a bug or if he is supposed to despawn/respawn.  I am assuming it is a bug also because there were some posts on Alla stating that he was down for several weeks before the quest was fixed.<br />
I wish I never started this quest due to the bugs in it...  I should have been finished months ago without all the bugs.   If I camped sev for 2 months I would have my Green scale :(  Only reason i did this was because I could finish it in a few days (providing it worked)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Jenswar Keelmore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I am starting to agree with you about not doing the quest. I have talked to guides and they have told me that it isn't posted as bugged on CT. So now it is and hopefully they will look into it. Meanwhile, I am trying to get up the people from my guild and freinds to go get the other 2 mobs i need to finish the epic I started 2 years ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Sakryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Same issues here with trying to Find Verrell --- 4 days with Warrior and Druid sitting at the totem and no sign of the little gnome, I have been using /bug and /petition with no luck on Torv.<br />
Only reason I even took off is that the guild decided that since we epic everyone else that I should have mine too, oh well looks like we hunt Sev some more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>turkishbull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">i never had to do this....../whew</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>wraq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Did you get the fractured scale?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Sakryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Nope didnt' get the fractured scale back .. did the handin followed along on the text got the box and vial, now off to Perma and Sol C to show them whatfor! /grin<br />
<br />
BTW seems Verrell appeared as if by magic after I hit the eqlive website and used the online petition (contact your GM) within 10 minutes Verrell was sitting behind me while I fished in North Ro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Darkeeper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Im curious to see if you have the same problem when you get the items Sakryn.  Let me know how you make out.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Jenswar Keelmore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Well good news, I got the GDS finally. BUT not from the quest found it in bazaar cheap and had a friend buy it...had togive up one of the RDS I had but not a biggy.&lt;Had three&gt; I still have the box and stuff for the quest figured I would hold on to it because I received an E-Mail finally from a GM and they are gonna look into quest and fix it with next patch. Seems that they are having trouble with a couple different NON-tradeskill containers for quests, the Box being one of them. He said that everything I had done to this point was correct. I am figuring I will jsut hold the box and sale the scale when I get it. Now I am trying to get the people up for Spiroc Lord on CAZIC-THULE server &lt;hint hint to anyone from that server&gt;. Asked guild they seem to think we would get our arses handed to us!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Midnyt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">They appeared to have fixed the quest combine containters on the test server, so I'm hoping with the patch on the 10th they will fix them on the live servers. <br />
<br />
*fingers crossed*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Galdaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">The update notes on everquest live site http://eqlive.station.sony.com/updates/upcoming_updates.jsp says that quest containers should be fixed with the patch on 3/10/2004.  Maybe then some of us will finally be able to complete the quest and epic.  The most frustrating thing for me is not that I do not have my epic in hand yet, because let's be honest, I will never use it unless they upgrade it.  I hate losing the bank space that this stupid container is taking up along with all of the bank spce storing blades and hilts for the final combine.  Oh well, I digress.  Hopefully, it will be fixed on the 10th like the update message states.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Midnyt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">The quest container is now fixed, only problem is I haven't been able to do the turn in because Verrell is MIA. Sat at his spawn point for 7 hours yesterday and nothing. Quest NPCs you have to do turn ins to after camping quest pieces should always be up imo.<br />
<br />
Anyone know a spawn time on this guy?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Galdaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I was wondering the same thing.  I have been checking him non-stop since I got home from work last night and he hasn't showed up yet, or has showed and poofed again.  6pm, 9pm, midnight, 2:30am, 8am still no sign of him.  I am just anxious to clear the container and 8 items out of my bank finally.  Oh well, I have waited this long so what is another few days or another week.  It is just hard to avoid the temptation to sell all of the pieces for MQ.  I could almost buy a BoC for the total of what some offer for the various pieces MQ combined.:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Galdaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I just spoke with a guide this morning.  He claimed that Verrill is on a month game time timer.  He then told me that GMs cannot spawn mobs which I told him was untrue.  He then changed his story to say that they are not allowed to spawn mobs.  I argued that I had been waiting a month for them to fix the quest containers, they should spawn him and was basically told I had to wait.  So how long is a month in game time?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Midnyt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">omg that sucks. :( <br />
<br />
On Wednesday I waited over 7 hours petitioned and heard nothing. <br />
<br />
On Thursday I waited about 11+ hours and petitioned again. The GM answered me within an hour of waiting and told me that I just need to wait because &quot;some npcs need to be reset after a server down&quot;, whatever that means.  A few hours later, a warrior guildmate stuck at the same spot logs on and I tell him what's going on so he petitions too. A bit later a guide answers his and tells him he will go check on something, so the guild comes to the spawn spot and looks for the gnome! No idea what good that will do. So he tells us the gnome should be spawning &quot;soonish&quot; and leaves. 8 hours later we are still waiting.<br />
<br />
Late at night right before I got ticked and logged off, another warrior showed up and told me she heard he was on a 36 hour spawn timer. We both agree that it's ridiculous and that's when I logged. <br />
<br />
With all the patches happened every day lately, he's never going to spawn. This is just plain BS in my opinion. He's a quest mob, he should be up all the time for turn ins. I had to camp the mobs for this quest I shouldn't have to camp the quest npcs too. It's this sort of stuff that takes the enjoyment out of the game. Sony really needs to re-think some of these stupid spawn timers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Galdaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">What is worse is the fact that he likely despawns for anouther month of game time once he hands someone the final item.  If multilpe people on the server are waiting for him, it will be whoever happens to be the lucky one that is online when he does spawn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Midnyt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Sitting here staring at the column in North Ro. Going on 40 hours and still no gnome. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Midnyt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">correction on the above post...<br />
<br />
just about 40 hours from server reset, Verrell Cogswin spawned. He did not despawn after turn in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Galdaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">He spawned for me about 30 hours after the server reset and did not respawn once I completed the quest.  I am so glad to have finally finished the epic and clear up that bank space.  Now to watch it collect dust.:cool:</div></div><hr />
