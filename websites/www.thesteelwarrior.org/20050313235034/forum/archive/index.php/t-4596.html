I think weve gotten one shot at 11:30pm on a Friday and that’s it. Only thing ever up in Eps is Rathe, how many guilds skip Coirnav and kill the Rathe first ? It seems like its what were gonna have to do since it’s the only thing that cant be ruined atm. Everyone is telling me we need 12-14 clerics to start the Rathe also ? =x We have 2  tanks at 9900 and about 3 at the 9k+ range one SK at 9k and 2 pals at 9k. Our cleric force can be at MAX 12 and I mean max with people boxing, last night we had 8 on xegony and 4 on Fennin Ro. Is it feasible for us to do Rathe with those #s ? Regardless next arbitor once we backflag im gonna nut up and Try it but I just wanted to get some opinions</div></div><hr />

12 clerics is enough if you got some druids too</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aspit</div><div class="date">12-06-2003, 02:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the number of healers required really depends on how you off tank the unmezzable.  If you are strong in rangers with root legs then you can root tank run ect and use less healing power.  If you dont then youre stuck tanking and at that point you will probably need 2 clerics 1 druid and 1 shaman or paladin per group of off tankers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Timmok</div><div class="date">12-06-2003, 02:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">10 clerics is doable, but depend on what strategy you use I guess. 1 in cave, 5 for offtank healing, and 4 for beating non-mezzables down. More then 10 clerics just helps give a bigger margin for error.<br />
<br />
And we did rathe before coirnav as well. <br />
<br />
IMO rathe council is much easier simply because you can retry if you mess up. Coirnav is more unforgiving.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trondir</div><div class="date">12-06-2003, 08:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">we do it with 1 SK 1 Cler 1 Dru 1 curer per group at offtanking, however what nobody mentioned is that you need an excellent pulling team as well. 2 CMs can turn your nice raid into a nightmare :) Also, you need assloads of enchanters that dont fall asleep while mezzing mobs for an hour or more</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Esvee</div><div class="date">12-07-2003, 07:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We did the Rathe before Coirnav, despite trying both before we got it. Winning on the Rathe requires luck to an extent; a small mistake can spell the end (especially if one of the 6 in the cave wakes up). We used knights to offtank 5 non-mezzable and had a skeleton crew to kill the last. <br />
<br />
Below 5% hp I think, the non mezzable only hit for about 800 regularly if I remember correctly.  We used knights, 1 cleric and a shaman/bst plus possibly a druid and ranger per offtank grp. <br />
<br />
Get someone to call the AoE (1 per minute) so melee can dart in and out and you should be ok. And above all, make sure those encs don t let any wake up in the cave.<br />
<br />
The Avatar of Earth is easier than a regular Councilman except that he rampages. <br />
<br />
Coirnav was the blocker for us; we allmost got him when they patched the ring timer; got him finally after many tries tho.<br />

<br />
On our server we have a rotation for Coir setup and untill all other 3 gods are down x2 you cannot enter the rotation which is what we did. We are now trying Coir and I hope soon to see the lobster dead.<br />

<br />
Almost won Rathe, 13 Seconds Late of poping AoEarth =\<br />
<br />
but anyway in my opinion , Rathe is EASYER than coirnav ..=0</div></div><hr />

<br />
We just killed the Ratheboss the first time (serverfirst ) and our last target is coirnav now.<br />
<br />
The DT and EoT ( only elemental guilds here ) have an agreement about rotation and a special chat channel for stuff to discuss. All lower guilds in moment make it like we do so on KD its momentary nice and easy.<br />
<br />
Changing the server was best thing we could do. <br />
<br />
For us the rathe council was easier than coirnav, cause you can kill that council better in a strategic way, while coirnav is a kill fast or die thing. Btw. I hate waterfights :D.<br />
<br />
But good luck to you Krassus, cause we ( the DT ) had never problems with you ( Triadica) in the time we were hunting the same mobs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
and yes, rathe is easier, you can try over and over and over until you're sick of it and see treehuggin hippies in your sleep. blow coirnav and get 3 days of relaxation errrr i mean blows you have to wait 3 days until you can enter the beauty that is PoW again...<br />
yeah that's what i meant to say.<br />
<br />
talk to you ingame some day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krassus</div><div class="date">12-09-2003, 08:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually on sol ro since DT has been gone its nicer, Odisea actually works with us believe it or not. were used to waiting though, like this is something new. <br />
Back then it was Ssra ! yay cleared b4 we even get home from work !! <br />
then VT yay cleared b4 we get home from work for 4 months straight. <br />
Now its PoP gods !! yay blown spawn b4 we get home !!  <br />
<br />
The general rule is once Euros done with it well get a shot, at least on sol ro the EP or whatever expansion competition is too much. Spawns should be like Xeg wipe, learn, &quot;maybe&quot; wipe again - then completely own it everytime. Even Fennin stays up for 5 hours, so if people fail it you can get their scraps. Coirnav is the biggest bunch of bullshit designed yet, it should not be blowable. I like Instancing, hopefully new expansion will let you have your own spawns every so often.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomb</div><div class="date">12-09-2003, 08:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lol, was somewhat different on Terris (I moved my cleric to KD 10 days ago).<br />
One EST guild was in VT before i could log on and at least one group of an US guild was killing cursed triggers to blow the spawn.<br />
KD was really a nice change with the way the guilds work together.<br />
But it definitely has its advantages being on the same time zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tarkas</div><div class="date">12-09-2003, 01:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just about every EP god is on a 3 day 6 hr respawn, you should get a shot at every other spawn if you watch for em.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dubb</div><div class="date">12-09-2003, 02:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wish it were that nice for my server.<br />
<br />
We have two Euro guilds in Elementals. They get first pick of everything they want, and raid up until the US guilds start, often finishing up after we've started.<br />
<br />
Then we have four US guilds in Elementals.<br />
<br />
The Euro guilds have what works out to be a 19 hour spawn window. If we're lucky, we get to compete for their scraps, and maybe get something to spawn during our raid time that we can rush and kill. If something spawns late in our raid time, or after we're done, it stays up until the next day for the Euros. The only guild that &quot;raids&quot; between our time windows is not even strong enough to kill Ssra spawns.<br />
<br />
Despite that, the US guilds maintain a progression advantage on these Euro guilds. I think it has something to do with the fact that you're either extremely motivated, or you get NOTHING. They can be as lazy and complacent as they wish, and still have all the spawn availability they could dream of.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krassus</div><div class="date">12-09-2003, 02:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dubb just summed it up Euros have a 80ish% chance at spawns no matter what time anything is killed, and not to mention 99% of patches in their favor EP guild count on sol ro is<br />
<br />
1 spanish<br />
3 german<br />
3 soon to be 4 american<br />
<br />
It makes us have to step our game up tons, we cant wipe to Coirnav for months straight like they can and practice, we have to go in their and win. In our monthly or &gt; chance.  I mean since ToV when we started our guild its been this way, come home and get scraps that we fight with 3 other guilds for. Pretty used to it already</div></div><hr />

<br />
Assume only European and US guilds.  Assume each guild can mobilize an effective force from 6p their time till midnight their time in order to kill a mob.  Midnight Euro time is 6p EST.  Therefore any mob that spawns from 6pm EST to midnight of the American guild (est or pst) will go to the american guild, any mob that spawns after midnight will be caught the next day by the European guild.  6/24 hours that a mob may spawn belong to a EST only guild 9/24 hours will be long to an american gulid in general, the reamining 15-18 hours is all European timezone advantage.</div></div><hr />

Very few guilds farm the Rathe or Xegony...they just take too long, so you generally will have more time to play around with them.<br />

In all honesty you can probably get it once during your time kill it and then it will take a speil only spawning on your timeslot.<br />
<br />
That stated, some guilds are being rude about plane of time in cockblocking other guilds when there really is no need to do this, considering everyone gets there own instance once a week, allowing each guild to go in and kill all the mobs from A to Z in time and not affect the next guild.<br />
<br />
People need to start looking at the larger picture on some servers, and start understanding Time is not like most other zones, once you have acheived PoTime in Theory 5 Guilds could clear it once a week each (If they can Clear time in a day)<br />
<br />
On a Side note our first real attempt for Science of War on TRC we only had 8 Clerics, and 7 Druids, we were able to get all the mezzables and all the tank mezzables out and undercontrol. However we missed killing the last mob by one minute.  Was kind of sad really as this is the last kill we need to enter Plane of Time, however we will be attempting TRC again tonight and by god it falls tonight or I re-dye myself Pink and break the warrior out of retirment to tank again</div></div><hr />

<br />
And if there's no forced rotations, or Asian time guilds (as mentioned earlier) to offset the spawn, you have to worry about it. A blown trigger without advancing far enough into the event = 12 hour respawn.<br />
<br />
Here's what just happened on my server... the other day, a Euro guild didn't have enough for an attempt, but decided to go blow the trigger anyway (30ish people for Coirnav, yet they've never beaten Avatar of Dust in PoAir). 12 hours put GoC past US raiding time, and up for the same Euros the next day for an attempt. With no Asian time guild to attempt in between, this can and does go on for as long as they want it to. After speaking with a GM on the issue, there's no rules to prevent any guild from blowing a trigger without sufficient force. Anyone can go kill Spectre of Corruption with 6 people, etc etc, anytime they feel like it.</div></div><hr />

I asked a GM and he told me that GM would do something against a guild that blow Coirnav to get it in their timezone, and I think it was on Kane Bayle that a GM kicked out of water a guild that had blown trigger.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually once the trigger has been killed it is a 3 hour respawn for GoC, it is only after You have killed any of the mini Nameds it adds extra time to the respawn of the event. In the event you fail on Coir himself, and are Banished it is then a 3 day repop.</div></div><hr />
