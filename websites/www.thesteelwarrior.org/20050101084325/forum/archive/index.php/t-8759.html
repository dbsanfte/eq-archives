<br />
If you are under say...65... any theme will probably be fine, as you just want the wins.<br />
<br />
If you are 65, it really depends on you needs. I woudl probably suggest at lest 10 wins in BB so that you can get the 10 AC/510 point augs from there. (Once you have them unlocked you can earn your 510 points anywhere.)</div></div><hr />

Even dropping from a 63 adv to a 58 drops earned points from 51 to 37--at 65th level. As I said, just get the wins--starting about 30th you shoudl get at least 1/2 the HP value of what you have earned on your stone.</div></div><hr />
