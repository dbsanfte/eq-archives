<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ernie</div><div class="date">01-06-2004, 04:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, you have heard this all before, so please, if you don't want to hear it all again, toddle on - cause this is gonna be a long winded one.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok, so waaaayyyyy back in the day (think Velious) I decided to make an alt.  I was having fun with my gnome enchanter main and liked the whole Velious gnome pirate thing and decided to make a gnome warrior.  I had my reservations about the race issues, but, after hanging around with a really great gnome warrior some I didn't think too much of it and Ernie Plankwalker was born.  This was well before Gnome Pallies and SKs were possible as well.<br />
<br />
I have been on again / off again playing for a while now.  Broke for a serious DAoC stretch, back again, broke for SWG and Planetside, back again, broke for FFXI and after realizing that while I think FFXI has some things over EQ the inability to talk to the majority of players is just plain stupid (**sends hate mail to Square/Enix dumbass exec who decided it was a good idea to have all the American english speakers play on the same servers as the Japanese**), I'm back to EQ again.<br />
<br />
So, I decide over break to just grind the hell outa of it and get my ass up to 65 (mid december I was 62, half way to 63).  So, I basically move into PoV and put in some serious hours.  Tonight, happily I ding over to 65.  YAY ME!!  However, in the same triumpient night I also have the biggest, crappiest let down by my class ever.  <br />
<br />
I take pride in using as many tricks of the trade as possible to do my job as a warrior.  I set up /shield macros for the slower and healer and anyone else likely to go splat quickly.  I ghetto bash to stop spells.  I circle strafe to make sure rogues and mage/necro backstabbing pets have a back to work on.  I place mobs as best I can.  I use all the cool new tools to the best of my ability.  Since coming back I have really liked the class and the changes the have recently happened and been looking forward to what is coming down the pipe.<br />
<br />
Then I get in the group with a good Paladin.<br />
<br />
WTF am I here for.  He is 1 level lower than me but obviously knows his stuff and is well geared.  We are at PoV West Castle Camp and the necro is pulling.  I know this camp inside and out after a weekend of 16 hour days grinding to 65 at it.  <br />
<br />
The pally, through mitigating the mobs inital damage spike in damage with stuns that work, tanks better than I do.   The mobs NEVER once ping to the slower.  The cleric is only using Heal Over Time spells and not CHing him.  The Chanty is slowing on the pull.  When the chanty goes LD at the same time as the necro flubs a FD and we get two, I go to off tank but the pally (who had already stunned the main pull and had it on him), convieniently root parks the add and calls me over to assist him kill the main like the meager DPS addition I am.<br />
<br />
Pally has to go... no worries, I'll step up and take over tanking.  Hey Ernie, says the necro, I gotta take a piss can you pull please?  Sure, np I know this camp inside and out.  So I pull the far back golem but as i'm pulling some dumb ass is training in from dragon door and I get an extra Arachnie on me from him ($%!#) no big deal, just an add, Chanter (65) can prolly mez it and we will beat em down.<br />
<br />
As you can probably tell by now, of course crap goes bad, chanter slows early instead of focusing on mezzing and bam, dies... I double tank with defensive but can't keep agro on both, cleric agro from heal, bam dead, necro still FD and afk so its off to the zone we go, our tails between our legs and screaming like the little girls we are :eek: <br />
<br />
Ok, np shit happens, people were sleepy and one afk, let's regroup, rez up and get back too it.  NP.  Set up, pull one and the necro snares on inc like he was used to doing with the pally, I fail taunt like 3x and even with shielding him the necro (was already liched some) drops.  Sure we kill it but still galls me that he died and I couldn't do a damn thing about it.<br />
<br />
Overall, why the fuck am I playing this char and investing so much time and effort into it?  I like my lil gnome beserker (rallos worshiper, whole bank of hot key'd shouts n pirate stuff), but why?  I want to tank and tank well, I play to win and all that.   Guess I'm just used to the Pallies I got into groups back in Seb grinding in the Kunark days cause they were friends when no one else wanted them.  Half of me is glad pallies don't suck that bad anymore and the other half wants to tear their self rightious class outa the damn game and shove them to hell.<br />
<br />
Fucking agro lock is bull motherfucking crap.<br />
<br />
They have a ton of utility. They have a huge array of spells that, among other things, buff themselves and their party pretty damn well.  How many times have you been caught in a group with a druid healing and a chanty slowing and not had a damn good buff on you.  If the tank had been a pally over a warrior, said tank could have buffed everyone up and themselves to be in good shape for tanking.  Me, I'm a low stam gnome tank who, with buffs and shammy lovins does ok.  Without em, I'm asked constantly about how many HP I have.  Pallies have heals - HEALS FOR CHRIST SAKE.  Hell, I've been in groups with my enchanter where the Paladin was the main f'n healer!  Sure we wern't pulling in uber exp or any such, but we were getting exp when not much else was going on.  Oh hell, someone died, want to take a pally rez or go beg for a cleric rez? nah just take the pally rez.  Root park, sure no problem.  Pull, sure pally got lull.<br />
<br />
Just nurf the gawd damn pally stun agro to hell so I can at least feel good about being able to hold agro just as well, if not a smidge better.  They can still agro fine from heals, or just root the damn thing and teach the group to deal with root agro - and heaven forbit, Taunt.<br />
<br />
:mad: <br />
<br />
Gah, guess I'll go blow some shit up in PS.  Fucking warriors :( <br />

<br />
Why can you not accept that a paladin is a better tool for the job in that specific situation while a warrior is the better tool for the job in many other situations.<br />
<br />
The problems with the 2-pull were partially, if not completely, your fault.  Those spiders are nealry invisible.  If you didn't let the enchanter know at least that it was a 2-pull, and preferably that you were engaging the spider 1st so that he could mez the easily visible target, then you didn't do your job as well as you could have.<br />
<br />
What weapons were you using?  While you might get unlucky and not proc, with the proper weapons and augments, you can stack the odds in your favor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">deliciouspk</div><div class="date">01-06-2004, 09:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's why I still play FFXI.<br />
<br />
Wow, a taunt that works... every time.  How fucking innovative.  <br />
<br />
I played an SK in EQ and let me tell you, the above poster is on crack.  There was NO situation in which a warrior was better suited to doing any job than me... ever.<br />
<br />
I maintained aggro better, if not flawlessly.<br />
<br />
I played smart, always giving pets the back, etc.<br />
<br />
The mob could be slowed, crippled, dotted 15 times and then have the shaman sit down next to it and it wouldn't even look at him.<br />
<br />
With KEI and FT 15 plus AA's, I could lifetap dependably to mitigate an assload of dmg.  Hell, I tanked in LDON missions with a necro being the only healer... easily.<br />
<br />
Slap Vie on me, let me clinging dark the uber mob on inc, and as long as the clerics could keep me up with the ridiculously fast Cheal chains that are required now anyways, that mob was parked.  If I died, another SK could stand in the exact same spot, cast clinging dark once or twice, and bring the mob right back.  Hell, I'd never even turn on autoattack, why bother.<br />
<br />
Yup, I was totally on the opposite side of the spectrum from where I had been back in the day.  I played an SK all the way from release.  I played through being the underdog, being useless ( or thought of as being useless), and impressed people with my ability to play untill they were happy giving a gimped SK a group, because they knew I knew my shit.<br />
<br />
Then suddenly I was on top.  All of the warriors that used to demand loot over me and call me useless on raids were suddenly on the receiving end.  Let me tell you, I rubbed it in too.  I demanded loot over the self same warriors who had done it to me, and used the same excuse... &quot;I'm more useful than them on raids.&quot;  I laughed, I chortled in glee, I even danced about a little bit.<br />
<br />
And then I realized how much it sucked.<br />
<br />
I can't stand to play a game thats unbalanced in anybodys favour, even mine.  It's just plain boring.<br />
<br />
So FFXI has my money for now.  I can change my class at the drop of a hat, the quests have cutscenes that make me laugh, and I look 100 times smoother than I ever did in Everquest.<br />
<br />
Oh ya, did I mention that warriors have a taunt that works?</div></div><hr />

/salutes with his gallonsized beer mug<br />
<br />
that pally knew his stuff WELL so i wouldn't be complaining, then again i can do decent dps with my weapons (augmented ofcourse) and /shield the pally just for kicks. don't worry about ones like that. worry about the one the othernight 2 lvls below me with over 120 more ac that took a SERVE beating whenever he took agro with his stuns.<br />
<br />
it's hard to find a good pally anymore since the class is so overpowered with agrolock and spells and most go down VERY fast when they take agro off me. i have been lucky enough to me some good ones and a couple that didn't know jack that LISTENED. look for the good ones and remeber when in that situation to be able to sya the hell with it and play with your offense while ofcourse using /shield on the pally, it tends to annoy them lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ernie</div><div class="date">01-06-2004, 01:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Guys, to clarify, he was 64 and a Baron title.<br />
<br />
I am 65 with 8 AA (Baron title).<br />
<br />
He was swinging what looked to be a Widebladed Greatsword (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=17157)<br />
<br />
I was using all the Bazaar weapons (CHoS/SotB (Aug'd with 75 dd cold and 50 dd fire - haven't gotten enough points for Anger's yet. GSoT with the 50 DD fire aug for kicks and a WMBS in the bag using it for DPS when the pally was tanking).  Here is my unupdated Magelo (doesn't have augs, my new levels, or WMBS in it http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=885152)<br />
<br />
That's what gets me.  He didn't out level me.  He didn't out AA me. He didn't really outplay me - he just had a better set of tools to work with in the first place.  I know the outplay me comment seems pompous, but seriously folks I've been in plenty of groups with my enchanters with Tanks that just plain suck - you know go afk while fighting, mob runs off they don't do jack, don't position right, don't use their disc for crap, never taunt when breaking mez, you know the kind.  I get complements all the time for my tanking and or grouping skills (I pretty much always &quot;run&quot; the group - line up new folks, get rezz's lined up fast, move us to camp and keep things rolling, cause well I like it when it is rolling)<br />
<br />
And Trondir don't give me that one patch too late argument.  Ok, the necro would darkness dot to pull mobs in.  If I did nothing and just let them do what they had been doing, one Stun and the pally had agro.  He didn't tag with a bow, he didn't do anything else except drop a stun on it (which stunned it because it stopped moving as it came in) and bang...mob went to the pally.<br />
<br />
I thought I'd get in game and try to snag the inc once - bow tagged and hit Incite at range.... mob kept going toward the Necro till the pally stunned it =P<br />
<br />
Ok, great I get defensive - but you tell me who you want snap agro tanking adds in a big raid - warrior or Pally?  Maybe that's why when I was listening in on Bert raid this weekend they had knights (mostly pallies, couple SK's) in working with the CC teams to hold down adds.  <br />
<br />
DeliciousPK - what server do you play on in FFXI?  I was on Fenrir and post lvl 40 (at least back in mid December last time I logged in) there just flat out was not enough english speakers to go around at that level, even with 2 linkshells to the two &quot;bigger&quot; serious english LS.<br />
<br />
Guess I shoulda made a knight =P<br />

But you say in your first post...<br />
<br />
chanter slows early instead of focusing on mezzing and bam, dies <br />
<br />
It was who's fault the ench slows before doing CC, and does not know that tash + slow immedietly = agro?<br />
<br />
I double tank with defensive but can't keep agro on both <br />
<br />
No one bothered to root the add?<br />
<br />
pull one and the necro snares on inc like he was used to doing with the pally, I fail taunt like 3x and even with shielding him the necro (was already liched some) drops <br />
<br />
Over the 12 seconds you where taunting(3 taunts), the necro did not think to FD?<br />
<br />
Yes, pallies do allow a group to be a little lazier, but since last patch, we certainly do well enough.  It is not your fault, not the pallies fault(he was even by your description using level appropriate stuns) that your group decided to get lax, and paid for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wychway</div><div class="date">01-06-2004, 02:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd have to agree. The rest of the group was sloppy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ernie</div><div class="date">01-06-2004, 02:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Redhanna allow me to elaborate on your questions.<br />
<br />
First, let me paint the backdrop.  I join the group after they had obviously been grinding a while (there was discussion about how nice it was to get some serious EXP over doing LDoN and raiding when I joined the group).  It is sorta late, 10 PM or so Pacific when I joined.<br />
<br />
The group was obviously used to Pally stun agro lock and NEVER being beat on by the monsters.  Ok, maybe I'm finding every excuse to blame the f'n stun lock, but it stands to reason if you had been grinding in the same place, same mobs with a pally tank and never getting hit, that you would just keep doing what you had been doing previously (slowing on inc, pulling with high agro darkness snare, etc.) and not think about it.<br />
<br />
Forgive my crappy quoting, does this board use UBB code for it?<br />
<br />
QUOTE****chanter slows early instead of focusing on mezzing and bam, dies****<br />
<br />
Yes it was a two pull, but having played an enchanter to 61 (stopped playing Pre PoP, never really took them back up again), I could see where just assisting the MA and slowing like you would have been doing all along would have been a reasonable course of action for the enchanter to take over immediately trying to CC the add.  The problem here is, even with Incite and whatever agro I had from melee + the chance of proc's does not = what the Paladin had been able to turn out previously.  The enchanter had probably also let their Rune fade or drop and not renewed it because they didn't ever get hit with the Pally.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
QUOTE****No one bothered to root the add.<br />
<br />
The Necro was afk, feigned and the cleric was probably in a 10 sec CH on me, rogue was doing his backstab thing, I was trying to tank and 6th spot was the Wizard that was coming up to take the spot left by the paladin, so there wasn't anyone available to root the add (that probably would have been rooted by the Paladin in a similar situation if they had been the tank and not a Warrior).The thing is, they died while it was my watch and I didn't have a damn tool in the book to do jack nor shit about it, whereas another class would.  Yes, class envy.<br />
<br />
QUOTE*****Over the 12 seconds you where taunting(3 taunts), the necro did not think to FD?<br />
<br />
I assume that he was confident that his tank could take agro or in the cleric to get it or was just got his clock cleaned with multiple 522 doubles and a 325 dmg proc or two.  He was also down to like 80% or so health from Lich.<br />
<br />
Again, perhaps not my fault as tank and more there, but the thing is, they died while it was my watch and I didn't have a damn tool in the book to do jack nor shit about it, whereas another class would.  Yes, class envy.<br />
<br />
So yes, I agree with DeliciousPK that there are very few, if no, roles where a Warrior could not be replaced with a compitent, well played tank.<br />
<br />
I am doubly jilted by this experience because I was so rudely slapped in the face by this realization on the very triumpiant night in which I had so joyously dinged 65 not an hour before hand.<br />
<br />
Makes me want to vomit (the time invested for the rotten feeling of accomplishment I now feel).<br />

<br />
The problem is way too huge now, and in my opinion, impossible to fix.  They just waited too long...<br />
<br />
Don't worry though, all you have to do is buy the next expansion and they'll give you OPENINGS!!  Unfortunately, I don't see any amount of openings giving the warrior class agro lock right as the monster comes in, or giving warriors the raw versatility that the other 2 tanking hybrids bring to the table.<br />
<br />
I play on Diabolos, got a solid group of RL friends that play there also atm.  I'm just screwing around however.  I swap my class constantly, run quests, explore, etc.  I did my time in an uber guild and in no way/shape/form will I ever race to the end of a game that doesn't have an end again.<br />
<br />
FFXI has its problems, but at least the classes seem balanced.  WoW is sounding nicer and nicer every day.  I'll be checking that out as well.<br />
<br />
After playing EQ since release, and working my way up to where I was at through blood, sweat, and tears... the week I saw 10 new SK alts pop up in my guild after we'd been juiced to such unimaginable levels of toughness killed me.  Watching those alts make 65 in a month made me want to puke.<br />
<br />
Imagine walking up to a guild group in plane of earth as they've just pulled a mob, the shaman slowed, and it's on him.  I cast clinging dark on it once, it's on me.  Out of pure spite left over from the bad old days, I maintain aggro the entire time, lifetap to keep myself alive, and tank that mob into the dirt.  Done it several times... it was easy.<br />
<br />
Imagine the raid is starting up on penix hill in fire, and people are still in half-ass groups screwing around till more people get there.  I go and pull one of those defender guys, and a group with 3 rogues in it ks's my group.  After that, every single mob I pull, I maintain aggro on WHILE circle strafing continously so that the mob is spinning in place.  We get xp from then on... it was easy.<br />
<br />
Imagine watching your equally geared warrior wife xping in BoT with friends on her own server, dual weilding aggro proc weapons (ldon modded as well of course) jamming incite and taunt at all the right times, and watching the mob run back and forth between the shaman and necro about 1/3 of the time.<br />
<br />
It just got too aggravating to even watch, and this is turning into a book.  I'm outta here.</div></div><hr />

If you want to feel power under your command as a tank, play a Hybrid. If you want to be a specialized unit brought out for situations that call for /defensive, play a warrior.<br />
<br />
Let's face it, though, the game has gotten to the point of 'beyond idiotic.' It's so bloated and mudflated that at this point, it's long since keeled over and collapsed into a pile of grey, pointless goop, in which every class has been blended and pureed to be made part of the recipe.
