<br />
briefly though, you must kill the 2 named decorians in under 2 minutes back to back to start the script, killing them spawns TZ and VZ. you have 20 minutes between each to get them dead. finally fake rallos spawns and poofs after you have done some dmg to him. you then got 20 minutes to get to the arena and engage the real rallos zek. he spawns several boars and war wraiths during the encounter to make it interesting.</div></div><hr />

RZTW = Pure melee with AE rampage &amp; a nasty AE DoT/Drain<br />
<br />
1st Zek rushes you when 2nd Decorin is dead<br />
2nd Zek can come with Zero to 5 adds (pretargetable mezable)<br />
RZ summons 2-6 adds (not pretargetable, some not mezable)<br />
RZTW summons a SHITLOAD of adds (gotta kite em and kill RZTW fast)<br />
<br />
With that &amp; Ludor you should be able to setup a strat after 5/6 wipes.<br />
<br />
My old guild wiped 17 times to RZTW event before killing him. (2nd or 3rd EQwide). <br />
Its not hard, but u have to be flawless. The timer is harsh but perfectly balanced.<br />
<br />
As for the raid, well a good 65-70 would be ok. DPS/CC is a must.<br />
Elementals do it with 50 without too much trouble.</div></div><hr />

Vallon Zek quad for 2000? I don't remember him hitting that hard ever.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not anymore. The adds that spawn in the intervals during RZtWL aggro have been greatly reduced. Combined with the fact that his HP has been reduced by a good 30%, the fight that separated the men/women from the boys/girls is now just a mildly annoying obstacle to get into EP's.</div></div><hr />

Well maybe more 1500 than 2000. but he hits bloody fast !<br />
Havent tanked the twins for more than 2 months or is it 3 ?<br />
But i do remember (or think i do)<br />
1st twin=500ish with disc ,  2nd twin=1000ish with disc<br />
So could be 900 and 1700 :) but VZ hits fast when not slowed <br />
<br />
As for RZ well i did notice the fight got a LOT faster.. (3:18 record)<br />
But my current guild went from 4 rogues 4 wiz 2 mages ....<br />
To 6 rogue 10 wiz 6 mages (all AA + full elemental + Focuses)<br />
<br />
Still theres a shitload of adds if you ask me :)<br />
Never kited only CH or Tanked, so when a &quot;BIG TRAIN&quot; or &quot;THE TRAIN&quot;<br />
hits me,they still look the same from my perspective .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">09-09-2003, 01:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First Zek = Quad1000 , Dispell, INSANE FRONTAL AE (cone) Sorry  Emilia, but this is one of my biggest pet peeves in EQ - there is no such thing as a frontal AE. Not understanding how AE works usually ends up getting people killed. There are only 2 types of AE - Targeted and Point Blank.<br />
<br />
Targeted AE - this type of AE the spell is cast on a target (the main tank) and the area of effect is measured with the MT at the center of the effect. This is usually the type AE that people call frontal. The problem is that when you corner tank a mob and push it onto the MT, the AE effect will reach well behind the mob and people will be hit needlessly.<br />
<br />
Point blank - this time of AE emminates from the mob itself. The mob is the centerpoint of the effect and to avoid this you have to exceed the range of the AE from the mob.<br />
<br />
Both types of AE have a 360 degree area of effect, the difference is where the center of the effect is.<br />
<br />
anyway, /hijack off</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gurgeh</div><div class="date">09-09-2003, 02:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tallon Zek hits for like 600 700, as same dmg AE as real TZ, difference being you can corner him and MT him, as Wandor already said, there is no 'cone' AE, only targeted AE. so have your raid stand at least 30 feets away from MT and everyone will be fine. Low hp people is what will kill you, if anyone goes low hp, TZ will finish him with AE and there goes your raid, if you have a 5k+ hybrid could be good to let him tank TZ, anyway /disc don't protect you from spells.<br />
<br />
Vallon Zek does not hit close to 2k, but his dps is still suprisingly high, splits 2 times, one can be mezzed and the other can be fully (or mostly) slowed. Only problem is to pull him, have a DA sk / pal handy after TZ, and have him train TZ + Guards opposite side of your raids as far as possible , TZ will warp back at his spawn point when trained far enough but not his 4 guards, just pull him at this point. It's better to have both puller camp before this.<br />
<br />
Hum, RZ does not summon 2 - 6 adds, but 2 every 50 sec.<br />
They all can be mezzed and rooted, no exception. If more than 2 come, it just means you did not clean properly around RZ area (adds pop a little before  turns, therefore chain aggroing anything on the way that could be up). You should depop RZ before 3rd wave or you'll likely lack dps for RZtW. Fake RZ depop at about 50%, AE TL your raid out at this point and come back for RZtW.<br />
RZ AE rampages (not much though)<br />
<br />
RZtW melee like RZ, rampages + have a weak AE dot fire based, easy to resist.<br />
He summons 6-8 adds every 50 sec once his HP reach 95%, easiest thing is to zerg him down, charm hasted and full debuffed diaku pre fight (malosinia tash snare) and throw them at the warlord, they will tear him down in no time. Unless you really have an overwhelming zerg forces you'll still need to CC the 1st 2 waves of adds probably, they all can be mezzed / rooted everything. kit them in the arena is a possibility but they run faster than SoW so you'll need more than one bait.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But a targeted ae is &quot;kinda of a frontal cone&quot;.<br />
Because it will go off in the direction he is facing (aka his target).<br />
<br />
While saying &quot;cone&quot; is totally innacurate, it gives people something they can understand much better than targeted AE:<br />
IF the mob is looking in your direction YOU ARE in trouble. <br />
<br />
Most people will probably understand :<br />
&quot;the AE will go off centered on the person highest on the agro list&quot;<br />
But wont react properly (at least to my experience) specially the 30 casters all tightly packed.<br />
<br />
Saying &quot;its a cone&quot; will get them running away as soon as he is facing them.<br />
<br />
Its a wrong statement, but it gets the job done :)</div></div><hr />

Both Zeks are &quot;leashed&quot; to the room and corridor. If they get close to the stairs in the end of that corridor they will warp back to the room and bring the decorins left there. Usually this happens because someone can't control his aggro, combined with some awful pathing (he runs to that part of the corridor and then comes back or warps if he goes past the leash).<br />
<br />
Only happened to us the first times we did, after that people were a tad more careful with their aggro.<br />
<br />
Saying &quot;its a cone&quot; will get them running away as soon as he is facing them.<br />
But also will give them the idea that they are safe as long as he's not looking their way, which is false. You can still be hit from behind if the MT is close to the mob, as in cornering him.</div></div><hr />
