<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Archonfire</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">New Skill:<br />
<br />
Telling Blow <br />
This skill goes from 10-250. It is obtained at level 9. This is a trained skill (IE it requires that you devote at least one skill point to it using a Grandmaster [trainer] Warrior). The first point put into this skill awards 10 skillups.<br />
<br />
The reuse timer on this skill would be (as a starting point) 15 seconds. The comparatively high reuse timer (cf Taunt with reuse of 6 seconds) reflects the power this skill ultimately has for agro control and maintenance.<br />
<br />
The skill's primary check for skillup would be Dexterity. Its secondary check would be Agility.<br />
<br />
This skill can be hotkeyed (ala Taunt, Bash, Disarm, etc).<br />
<br />
When Telling Blow is used, the next full round of attacks adds a percentage modifier to the dps agro, equal to +1% per skill level of Telling Blow. In other words, the next round of attack has an agro modifier to damage done only from between +10%(x1.1) hate (at untrained levels) to +250%(x3.5) hate (at max skill level).<br />
<br />
A full attack round is defined as the total hits for one skill roll of attacks, including dual wield, double attack, triple attack, and flurry. Using this calculation, a full round of attack has a total possible of five hits while using a 2hand weapon (IE a triple attack + a flurry for two additional hits), or seven hits while dual wielding (IE a triple attack with mainhand weapon + a flurry with mainhand for two additional hits, +2 for a possible offhand double attack).<br />
<br />
Procs, of any nature, are not affected by this skill.<br />
<br />
Misses, as well as special blocks (IE Dodges, Parries, Blocks, or Ripostes) are not affected by this skill.<br />
<br />
Telling Blow is not linked in any way to Disciplines; Warriors are free to use this skill while under the effects of a Discipline (IE Defensive, Evasive, Charge etc).<br />
<br />
Telling Blow may not be used in conjunction with /shield.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Archonfire</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">New skill:<br />
<br />
Rage of the Stalwart<br />
This skill goes from 26-240. It is obtained at level 25. This skill is trained (IE a skill point must be used at a Grand Master [trainer] Warrior). The first point put into Rage of the Stalwart awards 26 skillups.<br />
<br />
The reuse timer on this skill would be 30 seconds. This is to reflect the incredible potential power of this skill at high levels.<br />
<br />
The skill's primary check for skillup would be Strength. Its secondary check would be Stamina.<br />
<br />
This skill can be hotkeyed (ala Taunt, Disarm, etc).<br />
<br />
When Rage of the Stalwart is used, there is 1/8% chance per skill point (IE between 3.25% at the lowest trained level and 30% at the highest trained level of 240) that the user will instantly fly into a berserker frenzy, regardless of current health. This berserker frenzy lasts 10 seconds. During this frenzy, the user of Rage of the Stalwart would recieve a special bonus to his chance to score a Crippling Blow, equal approximately to the total bonus accrued from Combat Fury 3, and stacking with any AA modifications to Crippling Blow percentage.<br />
<br />
If the user is already in a berserker frenzy when this skill is used, a failure produces no effect, either beneficial or ill, while a success still provides the special bonus to the chance to score a crippling blow.<br />
<br />
Procs do not process during the duration of this berserker frenzy. This includes times when Rage of the Stalwart is used while already under the effects of a berserker frenzy; IE if Rage of the Stalwart is used while in a &quot;normal&quot; berserker frenzy, for the 10 seconds that Rage of the Stalwart is active, the Warrior would not proc.<br />
<br />
Rage of the Stalwart may not be used in conjunction with any Discipline.<br />
<br />
Rage of the Stalwart may not be used in conjunction with /shield.<br />
<br />
If Telling Blow is implemented along with Rage of the Stalwart, neither may be used in conjunction with the other.<br />
<br />
Rage of the Stalwart would be &quot;hard-capped&quot; at 240 skill. IE items with modifiers to Rage of the Stalwart (if they appeared), would not be able to raise the skill level for this skill above 240.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kannan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">lets make em a bit fun<br />
<br />

<br />
make alchahol more productive for a warr each diff type can add to dmg % and reduce the chance of being feared stunned or immobilized. lets face it your a lil more brave when yer drunk<br />
<br />

<br />
Have Int up your resists <br />
<br />

<br />

<br />
new disc- paralizing blow lvl 54 lands a blow to the nerves making opponent slow by 25% timer 2 min reuse time 15 min<br />
unresistable even to immune mobs.<br />
<br />
new disc- bitch slap huge aggro from embarrasement does 69 dmg and stuns for 12 seconds unresistable reuse time 6 min<br />
lol that was a joke but i had to put it in. give it a good name though and who knows.<br />
<br />
damage given and taken hell thats easy we should allready do 20% more damage than any mellee type and take 20% less <br />
and would not be too damn hard to impliment and should not even need a disc or skill to do it it should be natural from lvl 1<br />
<br />
this is just what i think should be a small change that would help out its not askin alot really its not.<br />
<br />
Hell I'm not askin to be able to do 1200-4k dmg with a weapon<br />
or to be able to solo hill giant at lvl 35 like almost all casters can <br />
<br />
