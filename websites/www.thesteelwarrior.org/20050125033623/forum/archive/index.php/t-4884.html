<br />
Case in point, there have been calls that the pally stun allows an aggro lock that trivializes the game.<br />
<br />
So, some people are calling for the aggro from the stun to be nerfed.<br />
<br />
It's pretty clear to me that the aggro on stuns was supposed to be a penalty, not a bonus.  And I mean all stuns, not just pally stuns.<br />
<br />
Anyway, if pally stuns are nerfed, you can be sure that ALL stuns will be affected to some degree.  This could remove all stun-producing weapons from our arsenal.  This includes Frostreaver, GSoT, and anything augmented with a Yak augmentation.<br />
<br />
I'd spend my points carefully until all the combat changes are live.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">12-22-2003, 10:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm personally of the opinion that they should simply remove any innate hate from stuns, and add in a simple hate modifier. That'd be much more easily tuned than it is right now. You could give low level stuns a more appropriate aggro level, and weapons designed for aggro a higher level of hate. Thoughts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Splaktar</div><div class="date">12-22-2003, 10:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hate on stuns was added to keep Clerics, Ench, and Wizards from chain stunning mobs w/o any aggro at all while melee/dps killed them w/ no risk.<br />
<br />
The problem isn't stuns or aggro on stuns, it's the broken stuns that were given to Paladins, ie: akeale or whatever.  The special 'Paladin' stuns should be no aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ahz</div><div class="date">12-22-2003, 03:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'll reiterate that the aggro component on stuns was never meant to be a bonus, but a pure penalty.  Therefore, any spell, item, or effect which produces beneficial aggro from a stun is likely to be nerf-bait.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Steenky</div><div class="date">12-22-2003, 05:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Likely, but not for certain. It's been like that since day one afterall.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raaj</div><div class="date">12-22-2003, 06:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are many things in the game that arent being used as &quot;intended&quot; but still are a major part of the game today. If they completely negated all stun agro not only would it destroy a lot of strategies currently used, but it would open up a whole mess of new exploits that could be worse than the current &quot;agro lock&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cuclain MacLlir</div><div class="date">12-22-2003, 10:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm. Sword of the Bloodsworn and Greatstaff of Thunder procs are unique effects, not duplicates of spells. So is Ykesha, both innate and augment.<br />
<br />
But Copper Hammer and Greatblade of Storms proc is a level 20 wizard spell. SoD proc is a level 34 enc spell. Let's think long and hard before we talk about nerfing stun aggro on low level spells.</div></div><hr />
