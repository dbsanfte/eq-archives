<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cimmar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK so i buy CoH and load it and all that crap. I have been hearing and looking at ss of all the cool characters you can make in the character selection. So I try and make some real superhero clones for fun, and try them out. Well my Hulk lookalike or Mr fix it is now lvl 15 and i like playing him and really don't feel like making a new char. So so i suck or no</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Just play him and continue having fun. Some people get bent over clones, but for the most part, people don't really get in your face, because they TOO have made clones. EVERYONE does it. The creation tools are just so much damn fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>irmingnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Do you like playing the character?  Did you make the character the way you want to no matter if it is a clone or not?  Do you care what other people think?<br />

Answer those questions honestly and you will have your answer</div></div><hr />

The Dev's are the most serious about copyright stuff, as its their game and butts that would be sued if someone else gets their britches in a twist.</div></div><hr />
