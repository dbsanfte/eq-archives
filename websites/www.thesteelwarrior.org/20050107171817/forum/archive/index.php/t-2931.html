<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chebbie</div><div class="date">09-08-2003, 03:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have browsed through Steel Warriors, looking for a list of suggested equipment for warriors at certain level stages.<br />
The  Paladins of Norrath forum has a very handy sticky post that is of great use.<br />
http://pub148.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathfrm20.showMessage?topicID=293.topic<br />
<br />
Note: The list is for untwinked, and quite realistic.<br />
<br />
Yes, I did look in the Library section.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chebbie</div><div class="date">09-09-2003, 09:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No one have a link to something similar to the linked equipment-level chart?<br />
I have been searching for information on armour for warriors and beastlords for the last few days. I have not yet come across anything as helpful as the Paladins of Norrath list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Romodar</div><div class="date">09-09-2003, 12:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm with you, Chebbie.  I came here looking for (among other things) a gear-check list for my recently-created warrior, similar to those on the pally boards to which I often referred.<br />
<br />
What I'd _really_ like to see, instead of (or perhaps in addition to) just a list of &quot;nice gear to have by lvl n&quot; is a list of recommended stat numbers at lvl n.  For example:  &quot;By lvl 25 you should have 600+ AC, 1200+ HP, STR approaching 200, STA at least 150, etc.&quot;  That with a list of reasonably-priced gear to achieve those stats would go a long way in helping the young warrior on his way to tank-dom, rather than embarrassing himself (and the warrior class) by loading up on black pearl gear. =/<br />
<br />
I'm still somewhat new to the warrior class myself, and my warrior somewhat twinked with much of my 55 pally's best tanking gear, so I'm not the best person to start a gear-check list.  Perhaps one of you veterans out there could work on this?  Otherwise I might give it a go after all...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CedVicious</div><div class="date">09-09-2003, 12:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's a good idea.  It gives the up and coming warriors something to steer by and it will lessen the gear check posts that pop 2 or 3 times a day on the boards.  Maybe put a sticky in the Bunker for gear check by levels 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60. Overlord and have someone with good exp write it.  Then others can post and update to it as gear gets added to the game.</div></div><hr />
