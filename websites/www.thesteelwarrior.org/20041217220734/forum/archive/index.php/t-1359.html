<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">06-19-2003, 01:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I always thought I pretty much understood how rampage worked.  Then, while reading the shaman message board(shaman alt is 53 now), I saw this thread: How does rampage and enrage work?  (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=14448) .  The thread links back to this board and an old thread on how rampage works:  Clarify Rampage?  (http://steelwarrior.xwarzone.com/showthread.php?threadid=121) .  This was followed by some one commenting that &quot;While the last post on page of that link is a good explanation to how Rampage works, like always it's missing a few crucial points, which is tied to some very frequent misconceptions. &quot;  I asked for clarification, and got the following reply:<br />
<br />
<br />
As most know there is a &quot;Hate list&quot; and a &quot;Rampage list&quot;. The Rampage list is a pretty short one(3 or 4 positions). These 4 people will stay on the Rampage list for the whole fight, unless they die and stay out of Rampage range for a certain amount of time(Rampage list doesn't forget you as easily as the &quot;Hate list&quot; and you can die and get rezzed back in and get Rampaged on, if you try hard enough).   However, and here is the key point, the positions on the Rampage lists aren't static. Despite what most people think, the hate generated does have an impact on the Rampage list. The person with the most hate on the Rampage list(anyone else doesn't matter) will be on &quot;Rampage&quot; and get Rampaged on. <br />
<br />
So, my question is...is this true?</div></div><hr />

This is total garbage.  The rampage list is ordered &amp; that order has absolutly nothing to do with varying levels of &quot;hate&quot; or whatever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">06-19-2003, 01:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't believe that crap. This is how rampage works -<br />
<br />
Old world rampage is very easy to control once you understand it. The rules are set in stone and are always the same. Every time someone comes up with some &quot;mystery&quot; rampage it turns out that other factors came into play and rampage did indeed work as advertised. These rules apply to all PRE-POP rampage mobs. With the advent of PoP, mobs gained the ability to AE rampage so the rules have changed, but they are still the same for pre-pop mobs.<br />
<br />
Rules for rampage:<br />
<br />
1. The rampage list is static and is not changed by zoning or death. The only things that will change the rampage list is a successful memblur, camping out, or on rare occassions when FD successfully memblurs.<br />
<br />
2. The rampage list is set in the exact order that players get agro.<br />
<br />
3. Rampage hits only 1 person each time it triggers. The person taking rampage is subject to a full normal round of attacks. If the mob quads and bashes, 1 round of rampage will be a quad + bash (if bash is up).<br />
<br />
4. Rampage NEVER hits the person who has current agro, even if they are #1 on the rampage list. If the top person in rampage range has agro, it will hit the next person on the list that is in range.<br />
<br />
5. Rampage has a range and it is different for every mob. Some mobs, the range is smaller than max melee range, other mobs the range is damn near the entire zone.<br />
<br />
6. Rampage never his someone who has successfully FD'd. When the person gets back up they will resume their place on the rampage list unless they got lucky and the FD memblured the mob. This is why monks and SKs are great rampage tanks. If they miss a heal, they can FD until a heal lands.<br />
<br />
7. Rampage is a proc. Cripple helps reduce the number of rampages a mob does.<br />
<br />
The best thing an up and coming guild can do is to learn to manage rampage on a rooted rampaging mob - IV in Akheva is a really great training mob. You can see the rules in action, the results are replicatable.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that these rules only apply to pre-PoP mobs. AE rampage is a whole different beast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Korinn_emarr</div><div class="date">06-19-2003, 01:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well from that quoted section he has a lot of things right but also a lot of things wrong.<br />
<br />
Rampage list isn't limited to 3-4 spots. A whole entire raid will get on the rampage list all you have to do is agro said boss.  The way the rampage list works is the first person who enters it ( through agro ) will be rampaged unless that person is also the highest person on the Agro list. If the same person is in the top possition on the Rampage and Agro list then rampage will hit the SECOND person the Rampage list.<br />
<br />
Rampage can also have a range associated with it. Some mobs can rampage across the whole zone while others need to be in a certain range to hit their target.  One person can be at the top of the agro list and then get knocked out of the mobs rampage range and then the next person down on the Rampage list will get hit by rampage.  <br />
<br />
The rampage list can only change through a memwipe from my experiecen. That's why monks / pullers, who would be #1 on the Rampage list since they agro'd the mob first, aren't always the Rampage Tank. If the puller brings the mob in , FD's and his FD is succesful in performing a memwipe then he will be removed from the Rampage list.<br />
<br />
I don't know about the whole dying and being rez'd back to the top of the rampage list so I can't comment on that.<br />
<br />
That's Rampage how I understand it and I am almost certain that's how it works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">06-19-2003, 02:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I thought it sounded wrong, but wanted to make sure.  Thanks all for the replies.  Good to know I did understand rampage right, and what I quoted was wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">warwolf</div><div class="date">06-20-2003, 05:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">does the positionning of the rampage tank have any importance or not while in rampage range?<br />
for exemple, does the rampage tank have to face the mob or can he be on its back and still get the rampage?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">06-20-2003, 06:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">rampage tank needs to be in range of his rampage, whatever that may be, normally its his max melee range but not always. if you arent in range, he will pick someone who is in range to rampage on. if no one is in rampage range though, there is essentially no rampage, it wont hit the MT.<br />
<br />
normally rampage tank should try not to do too much dmg, i dont do any at all, so you make sure you are not the next on the primary agro list if the MT dies. person who agroes second will be the next rampage tank if the first one dies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Janus_Eci</div><div class="date">06-20-2003, 10:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I used to believe the old way, but now I'm not so sure.  Doing Itraer Vius a few days ago, the specified rampage tank was still alive, but I (probably about 6th to engage) was taking 50-75% of the rampages.  Now I'm not really sure what to think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tsebach</div><div class="date">06-20-2003, 12:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just lead my first Vindi kill a few weeks ago, so I read up on rampage so I could learn how to contain it.  We went through great pains to make sure our two SK's would be the first two aggroing so they could soak it up.  However, they didn't get touched.  Our ramp tank ended up being a ranger, who didn't attack or anything until the melee charge was called.  I can think of at least 10 people who should have been higher up than him, yet we had 3 druids keeping him alive the whole fight. ;)  Like the post above, I don't know what to think. ;)<br />
<br />
PS.  I asked him, and no, he didn't fire any arrows at Vindi on incoming. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">06-20-2003, 12:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">rampage is hard to set on IV, normally you set up right behind him so everyone is on his hate list. no telling who is the RT unless you camp out the entire raid, leave one person you want on rampage in and then have everyone camp back in. its worth while to make the clerics do it though.<br />
<br />
maybe ranger was sitting on vindi inc, no clue. <br />
<br />
its not that big of a factor on most mobs, the rampage simply isnt that bad. but you must set rampage on mobs like arch lich and even lesser ssra named like HP or the rampage could easily 2 round ppl and slowly pick your raid off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Promethis</div><div class="date">06-20-2003, 02:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just a few observations.<br />
<br />
Despite what most people think, the hate generated does have an impact on the Rampage list<br />
<br />
False.  The amount of &quot;hate&quot; either from procs or damage has zero effect of  Rampage.  The rampage list is set from the initial aggro and members are added in the order they piss the critter off.<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
<br />
Aggro Emp Ssra with your rampage tank, then have MT take over.  Rampage will stick on the rampage tank until one of a number of criteria happen:<br />
<br />
1.  Ramp tank moves OOR<br />
2.  Ramp tank dies<br />
3.  Mob dies<br />
<br />
Once one of those three criteria are met, rampage switches to the next person who got aggro after the initial tagger and MT.  Generaly, thats the first cleric who had a heal land when MT was aggro.<br />
<br />
We got got our asses kicked first trying Emp way back when because our healers would get the ever living shit kicked out of them by rampage.  So we began using *every* monk we had to stonstance him spawn to get at least 3-4 people + MT on his hate list.<br />
<br />
Now, the rampage list IS static in my experience.  I have vivid memories of ramp tanking Creator in early Ssra, only to be rezzed and instantly die to rampage again.  Rampage list is completely cleared only when the mob dies (or is unaggro but I'm not completely sure on that).<br />
<br />
Best way to control aggro, is have your ramp tank tag the mob in, or if its a rooted critter have the ramp tank toss a few arrows or something at it before MT engages.<br />
<br />
As long as the ramp tank tags the mob on inc BEFORE it aggros the MT (thereby getting clerics on hate lists), MT can pull off 1-3 arrow shots without problem and leave the ramp tank to soak up the rest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bingor</div><div class="date">06-20-2003, 09:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A succesfull memblur will reset the rampage list.<br />
<br />
Emp is a bad example though. His rampage has always been screwy, unlike the other Luclin bosses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Promethis</div><div class="date">06-20-2003, 10:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We've always controlled rampage on Emp on a succesful aggro.<br />
<br />
We had every melee toss something (dagger, arrow, shuriken etc) at him when he spawned just to make sure.  And his rampage only went on 1-3 people on average and hardly the clerics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mourningloree</div><div class="date">06-23-2003, 03:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Rampage used to be not cleared on death but that got changed at some point.  I recall getting a res on IV at one point and popping in on rampage just to die again.  That never happens anymore.  Also if your rampage tank goes out of range of rampage no matter what that range might be things tend to get messed up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">scrab1</div><div class="date">06-23-2003, 07:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Regarding Vindi, he has a weird relationship with his guard pets.  You can aggro vindi just by hitting his pets even when they are split out beyond his lazy range.  Thats probably what happened to that ranger.  He got on vindi's rampage list by damaging the pets first.  Pets transferred aggro to vindi.  Vindi kept aggro the whole time pets were going down, then pull vindi and he has a pre-set rampage list.</div></div><hr />
