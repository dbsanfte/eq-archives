Rate as a raid aggro weapon with an A3 aug in it.  Does it compare with say a BoC and a CHoS with a A3 and yeksha aug respectivly?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cloudwalker21</div><div class="date">11-17-2004, 02:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would assume that it would work really well as an aggro weapon due to the stun proc which is on par with ykesha I would guess (not to mention the 6 second stun is a nice utility proc on stuff that it will effect) and the damage aggro is nothing to sneeze at. I'd say its like a half a BoW, higher damage but also higher delay, and weaker stats + proc but it still should perform well. <br />
<br />
In comparison to a BoC/CHoS with anger 3 and ykesha I think it would probably not do quite as well, although the dps aggro from it can help close the gap. I'd say its really your pick, though I think in the long run the BoC's EB + anger 3 would match the norge'tal's procs.</div></div><hr />

i used one with an anger3 proc.  agro was very good, i'd say better than the BoC+A3 / GBoS +A2 that i was using previously.  it is sort of weak on stats, and the inate proc has a fairly substantial knockback effect that can be annoying.</div></div><hr />

You will notice the knockback at times. Overall, id rate it lower than the 1hander example you gave in original post as far as agro goes. Its still just 2 procs going instead of four.</div></div><hr />
