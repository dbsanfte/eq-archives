I guess I'd better patch the target window into Sars 4 and give this a try.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But I had noticed that the target circle does make it easier to find the hitbox on flying mobs.  Also it kinda seems like the target circle defines the mobs melee range...anybody checked that?  Now we can all just slay the giant lifesaver and not worry about where the actual mob is :p.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Buuhmann</div><div class="date">11-11-2003, 10:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the &quot;blazzax kind&quot; of fiend models is about the same like the birds. The model does a great jump ahead but the mob ( and his hitbox) don't move.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">arative</div><div class="date">11-11-2003, 12:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I checked last night, the circle doesnt indicate the mobs melee range or its hit box. I was well outside the circle and was able to hit and be hit by the mob I was on. As far as I can tell, the circle only is only defined by the size of the mob, take a look at it on a gnome, its small, take a look on a barb, its larger. I do think that the circle is one of the best things to happen in a while to melee, can always tell where a mob is at.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aldarion_Shard</div><div class="date">11-11-2003, 12:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">it doesnt exactly follow melee range, but it DOES scale with melee range.<br />
<br />
in other words, compare the circle on a Air Avatar to a Fire Bird.  If you stand just outside the cirlce youll ALWAYS be just at egde of melee range.<br />
<br />
Its only buggy on PC models, but fuck PvP anyways.</div></div><hr />

I absolutely hate those birds :(. EVERY fight I miss swings because of where I think the dumb bird is as opposed to where the game thinks it is. This will be very handy.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tinmari</div><div class="date">11-11-2003, 03:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You probably use a custom ui.  You need to copy the files with &quot;target&quot; in the name of them that were modified 11/3 or 11/4 into your custom ui folder.  I apologize for not having the names available.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pumilio</div><div class="date">11-11-2003, 03:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">and if I just use the default UI? = p</div></div><hr />

<br />
on top of that, the stupid little tiny mobs in water like the little frogs and the tiny krakens and stuff are MUCH easer to deal with as a result of them.<br />
<br />
Chalk one up for SOE.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is a lavatunnel leading from Jopal village area into castle 1, there are some Jopals guarding that tunnel at the castle side.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draganetti</div><div class="date">11-11-2003, 08:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, very helpful for flying mobs. . .however there is a problem.  If you are fighting a mob on uneven ground (such as in the tunnels in plane of air), the targeting disk stays level as the ground does not, and as a result you can get a big face full of glowing lifesaver that sucks ass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ODB</div><div class="date">11-12-2003, 07:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Staring at the ring can make you lazy though, and get you killed. The posistion of the ring does not change when the mob turns around. In the case of the Pheonix' and demons in fire, you could be eatting ripostes and enrages before you know the mob is facing you.<br />

I learned this the hard way, nearly dieing to Hydrotha and Jax Chickenass in fire.</div></div><hr />

Yeah this was great for keeping track of the Triumvirate of Soil, those guys can be a real pain if they invis.</div></div><hr />

Right now i'm looking around for customized targeting circles :)</div></div><hr />
