<br />
Here are some quotes :<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
What will the Bulwark of Vie line of buffs actually do? Rumors range from stun resist to damage mitigation to rune-like effects. <br />
<br />
Will the LDoN spells be questable? The LoY spell quests were pretty cool.<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The Vie line of spells absorb a certain percentage of damage done each melee hit, up to a maximum total points of damage. <br />
<br />
Hmm… I don't know if the spells will be quested or purchased. Sorry. <br />
<br />
A<br />
<br />
Followed by...<br />
<br />
The Vie spells <br />
<br />
I just did a very small test of this spell (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=4091&amp;source=Test) <br />
<br />
Without Vie: max hit 110, min hit 34 <br />
With Vie: max hit 99, min hit 31 <br />
<br />
Vie didnt drop before the duration ran out - despite me taking a good deal of damage. <br />
<br />
Thus it seems rather obvious just how it will be working - and I would say its a very usefull buff.<br />
<br />
So before that spell, the only way to reduce the damage was defensive and the Time shielding mod. Now cast this spell on a knight, and he tank better thank than a warrior under defensive, without having the damage restriction of the discipline AND able to cast spells AND with perfect aggro control.<br />
<br />
I dont know what are the parameters 100/10/1600 are, but there if 10 is the damage reduction (as it seems), there is a Wizard spell (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=4069&amp;source=Test) wich is 100/25/1280. 25 is what I expect of defensive usually (without extended parsing). <br />
<br />
so I'll quote Kadah while agreeing at 100% to<br />
I got two words for Absors PR job, and SoE right now.<br />
F(screw) You. <br />
Thanks for giving casters better AA's and generally ignoring every non casting class. <br />
Pat yourselves on the back boy's you deserve a steel warrior kick to the ass. <br />
<br />
Im so disgusted right now. <br />
You guys couldnt do one melee fix at all? You couldnt while twinking the F out of clericv's and paladins and magicians maybe have reduced Area taunt at all? Or made some of our offensive AA's useful?.<br />

the wizzy spell cost 1 peridot to cast ( ok, not that big) and is limited to a 320-dmg-per-hit reduction<br />

Shield block was wrong, this is even worse. Putting aside the general foul taste in the mouth from having your soul class defining ability bitched out: Can you imagine what something like this would do to encounters? Especially in the low end? A stackable damage reduction of 20% against melee damage for a peri? I have never been a big opponent of &quot;mudflation&quot; but that is absurd.</div></div><hr />

The mob have DI 4, DB 30:<br />
30+1*4=34<br />

It seems as if both DI and DB are reduced by 10%:<br />

<br />
Does this spell stack with defensive/evasive? If so, it might not be as bad as some appear to think. It's sort of an indirect slow nerf perhaps, since it's giving non-slowing classes a chance for a damage mitigation buff - pop groups could head out with one of these casters and not a traditional slower. But way too early to say much about it now I guess.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's more of a long term mini-defensive that works for all. The problem being that the only last arguement for even considering a warrior for an exp group is the 10-20% class advantage for mitigation. This effectively cancels out this bonus leaving anyone with a sword and a spellbook, not only the clear choice without the buff, but a glaring choice with it. <br />

One would have to be dense to not pick a knight if this goes live as is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Duration on test is 36 minutes atm.<br />
<br />
<br />
and even if the spell need to be recast, you will have a knight tanking, whith perfect aggro control, efficient self heal. A paladin can LH himself, or even heal himself with fast heals between mob rounds, making him securise the situation.<br />
<br />
This spell will make all PoP xp content where the argument &quot;warrior lack aggro but they have more hp so they last longer&quot; flawed. Every low end guild on Velious/Luclin content will no longer require a defensive warrior. Of course I'm sure we'll continue to use warriors because &quot;we must do something at least&quot;. But will we have an edge on tanking bosses ? our advantage is become smaller and smaller.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If a cleric is going to use it on a knight they are going to use it on a warrior. The problem here is that it just further helps knights tank exp mobs. The advantage warriors had in exp groups was slightly more hp and ac, this will just be overkill for warriors in exp groups, and more help to knights in the only advantage we had in exp groups.<br />
<br />
<br />
Giving everyone better migitation (if the spell is cast on them) means knights can tank exp mobs even more safely now with 100% aggro lock is so retarded its beyond human comprehension. I didn't expect anything great but to just further screw us exp wise is just......  No words heh I can think of without just spewing profanities. Its hard not to overreact given SOE's past record towards completely ignoring warriors.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually the reports I've read say it is lasting it's entire duration.  Maybe that's a bug, who knows?  But 300 mana for a rune like effect wouldn't be of much worth.  Either they make a rune and it won't be used very often or they make it last the entire duration and give Knights 10% more damage reduction, because we all know that Warriors will drop another notch down on the desired list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaldanm</div><div class="date">08-26-2003, 02:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, it is not.<br />

the 1600 is the max damage : that mean if a mob is hitting for more than 1600 per hit, then the damage over the 1600 is not reduced ( meaning the reduction is maxed to 160 hp per hit for this spell )<br />

<br />
and the cleric who tested it said :<br />

Vie didnt drop before the duration ran out - despite me taking a good deal of damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">08-26-2003, 02:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm hearing it does stack with discs...I'm trying to clarify if it will always last the entire duration independant on damage taken, or if it only goes up to the max amount.<br />
<br />
Clerics have two lower versions, Ward of Vie (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=4088&amp;source=Live) (lvl 24) and Guard of Vie (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=4089&amp;source=Live)  (lvl 44).  Bulwark of Vie (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=4091&amp;source=Live) is 62.<br />
<br />
Ward of Vie is 10% off hits also, with a max of 460.  Two options...<br />
<br />
1. It takes 10% off each hit, with a max of 460 saved per hit, and will always last the full duration no matter how much damage total.<br />
<br />
2. It takes 10% off each hit, and the max it can protect against total is 460, and it drops after it takes it. (i.e., rune that works on 10%)<br />
<br />
If the max amount is 460 from a 10% mitigation, how many mobs you think will do 4600hp in one hit?  Heck, how many mobs you think will do 16,000hp in one hit for the highest version (the one with 1600 max)<br />
<br />
Conclusion from this info, it's a rune, but it only works off 10% of each hit (20% for encanters) until it reaches max.  Not a constant mitigation, and with a 300mana cost (on abjuration, which most clerics are NOT specialized in) for the highest, it'll be expensive for a cleric to keep up on a knight constantly.  Hell, it burns through my mana casting Blessing of Faith (10% spell haste) on the casters and myself, and that's only 200 (add specialization since it's alteration).  Makes sense now for enchanters to have the better version, since it might be a rune.  Wonder if it'll have the same amount of aggro associated with it.<br />
<br />
Waiting to see if Absor answers my post on cleric board tho to confirm.</div></div><hr />

Read again Chatja, it's not a rune, it's a buff letting you take less damage for up to 160 damage per hit for 36 minutes.</div></div><hr />

1600 DD is still 1600 DD now, later,or over the next 36 minutes in itty bitty chunks. It's still 10% at a whack, which if it isn't stopping more than 20 or so per tick standing regen with buffs already covers that. Why bother?<br />

We're not going to sit there and go, well, okay, the pally's in the group, we'll cast BoV on him, boom, he's magically jsut as good as a warrior. No.<br />
<br />
Cleric and pally in a group, he gets BoV, 10% better mitigation. Fine<br />
<br />
Cleric and warrior in the group, he gets BoV, the WARRIOR has that 10% better mitigation.<br />
<br />
This new spell benefits ALL melee, not just pallies. The present mitigation disparity is going to be preserved between warriors and knights, not cancelled. Both paladins AND warriors will gain equal benefit from this spell.<br />
<br />
And it's a far cry from defensive. Denfsive is 50% mitigation, PLUS we'll get BoV for a total of 60% mitigation. While paladins onlly get that 10% mitigation.<br />
<br />
Hell, I'm a hell of a lot more concerned about those FORTY FIVE PERCENT improved damage and healing focuses on Test.<br />
<br />
This buff changes nothing. if you give the same damn thing to do different people, there's no balance change.<br />
<br />
For those of you saying that paladins tank just as well with Vie as warrior do without it. That's a long the same lines as saying paladins with virtue have juat as many hitpoints as warriors without virtue. Who cares? In an experience group, they're both going to have it, so it really doesn't matter.</div></div><hr />

only small advantage we have over knights is that when we can actually get them to hit us we take 10% less damage than they do.<br />
<br />
now this change helps us.. yea but we tank just fine now.. give it to a pally and they tank just as good as a non-defensive warrior but have 100% better aggro control</div></div><hr />

You keep assuming that paladins are going to be the only class to get the benefit from this spell, that paladins are going to have the benefit of Vie 24/7, and warriors will not, so paladins all of a sudden tank just as good as warriors. That simply is not the case.<br />
<br />
Warriors get 10% added to their mitigation.<br />
<br />
Paladins get 10% added to their mitigation.<br />

<br />
The mitgation gap is PRESERVED. Yes, paladins tank better, however warriors also tank better.<br />
<br />
Say a paladin tanks something now, takes 1k per hit.,<br />
Warrior takes 900 per hit from the same mob.<br />
<br />
With Vie, the paladin will take 900 per hit<br />
With Vie, the warrior will take 800 per hit.<br />
<br />
You're saying that the paladin AND the warrior with the introduction of Vie will both take 900. That's patently false.<br />

There's no balance changes here. The warrior tanks better than the paladin, as he always has.</div></div><hr />

Who cares if paladins can tank just as well as pre-Vie warriors? You're comparing apples and oranges. With Vie, warriors tank better than paladins, just as they always have. There's very little to no change in balance. instead of paladinsat 90% and warriors at 100% when speaking of mitigation, sure, paladins will be at 100%, but WARRIORS WILL BE AT 110%. So instead of cheering about an upgrade which benefits warriors just as much as any class, you're screaming about it actually beeing a nerf? Sheesh!<br />

Apples and oranges. You're making a false comparison. Warriors will be superior to knights in mitigation for experience groups, just as they always have. When this spell comes out, present warriors will no longer exist, and instead we'll have a 10% better mitigation warrior. The warrior still retains his mitigation and hitpoint advantage, and the paladin retains his aggro advantage... and every other class in the game has a minimum of 10% better mitigation, should they choose to pay the component cost for it.<br />
<br />
warriors 10% less damage taken (when we can get the mob to hit us) on top of the fact that we dont get hit that damn hard to start (comparitivly) in exp groups.<br />

No, they don't get a better deal. The same problem exists, as it always has. This new spell, at the end of the day, changes exactly jack and shit.<br />
I believe you're just thinking that knights get more out of this than warriors because you're oversensitive to the warrior issues, to the point where now you're only looking at anything as to how it's going to harm warriors, not help them. Case in point is how you don't care if Vie gives awarriors 10% better mitigation... HELLO??? it's 10% better mitigation! that hard hitting mob instead of hitting me for 1k will hit me for only 900!<br />
and what Idiot gets a pally/sk and a warrior? get a real dps class in there instead of the warrior.  <br />
Not many groups. I didn't at any point say warriors and pallies were in the same group, but an idiot who gets a second tank when he doesn't have bard or chanter to mez adds isn't actually an idiot at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Two things make a good exp tank (well a competant one)<br />
<br />
<br />
The ability to take a hit, and the ability to taunt a mob to focus it on you<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
A warriors weaker point of the two is aggro. A knights weaker point is the ability to take a hit. The knights weaker ability is getting upgraded here.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Giving a a tank who can guarantee aggro on him a 10% migitation change &gt; a tank who cannot guarantee aggro when both can already tank exp mobs in POP fairly well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Think of the ramifications of the spell a little farther, though.<br />
<br />
The warrior gets hit less hard, so the mob doesn't need to be slowed as quickly or the warrior healed as fast. This gives him more time to build aggro, which means he'll lose aggro less.<br />
<br />
The chanter or cleric, or even the shaman or wizard gets hit less hard when they do get aggro, so they die less, so having to have an aggro lock becomes less important.<br />
<br />
This is NOT going to harm the warrior class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">08-26-2003, 05:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry, we disagree. Who really benefits from this buff? Mostly MT's.<br />
<br />
Damage shock at initial contact has never been a concern with exp mobs. Before slow, Warriors have Defensive and Knights can be Runed. But to be fair, it doesn't work that way for Knights as the mobs are slowed on incoming since their ability to obtain aggro from a distance insures the slower can afford the risk.<br />
<br />
When a Warrior MT's, the risk to the group is his ability to quickly obtain aggro (especially from a distance) and hold it - not that his mitigation is too low.<br />
<br />
When a Knight MT's, the risk to the group is that the mob gets a lucky streak, quads for 2k's and the tank dies. This buff can smooth out the damage and remove this element of risk to the group.<br />
<br />
Maybe this buff is too expensive to use except for mini-boses in BoT (for example). If so, it still disproportionally benefits Knights who aren't otherwise a very good choice to tank such mobs.<br />
<br />
I suspect it will be a nice boost for them while MTing in the LDoN pocket dungeons.<br />

<br />
Paladins with this spell can tank more efficently in tier 3 zones now, With the aggro situation as it stands all this spell did was increase knights and decrease warriors abilities.<br />
<br />
My point of example is, Using this spell a giant in BoT that hits for 500+ will now hit the MT for 450+, With guarenteed aggro lock as it stands that means Paladins become better damage absorber's under this affect then before.<br />
<br />
Notice there is a reason I stated paladin's. Its because they can generate so much aggro in tier 1-4 thats its idioitic to not pick them as a tank. Sure I can grab aggro and hold it pretty damn well with my GSoT, But I still need to establish aggro as the mob comes into camp. Mr pal can just hit three spell crystal's and mr mob will love his lil laying his hands on little childrens asses self.<br />
<br />
Other then that this spell seems like a benefit.. oh wait, Everyone who has access to it, Will be xping in PoP with a knight class as MT @_@.<br />
<br />
If you then say this still wont hurt us then well, Are you with us or agaisnt us?<br />

<br />
Not true.. we are talking less hard by 10%.. thats 1 hit every 10 hits. not huge.<br />
<br />
but over 10 or so fights the cleric has more mana due to the tank taking less hits.<br />
<br />
hes still going to need a heal.. maybe 1 more sec.. 2 even? still heal/slow/tash whatever will have to be thrown on it. same aggro same issues.<br />
<br />
But on the flipside. a pally/sk (who does not take a hit as well as me now) will take the same amount of damage i take now but be able to keep aggro through slows and heals wtih ease. And 10 min of exp later the pallys has needed 5-6 less cheals than before ldon, so cleric mana not an issue (not like it is now with a slower that can malo/slow on pull)<br />
<br />
If they said we are changing all knights by increasing damage mitigation by 10%<br />
<br />
you would flip out.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is no diffrent. &quot;Oh but the warrior can use it too&quot; Yea tell that to the warriors who sit there 2 hours lfg-<br />
<br />
Does not help warriors at all if warriors cannot get into a group to get it cast on them..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kavak</div><div class="date">08-26-2003, 05:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I agree knights need zero improvement on the tanking area, yet they are getting an improvement here. Any improvement to the knight class right now in that area without looking at warriors aggro issues hurts our class even further as far as exping goes, because we are in competition for that tanking slot. Knights are already more desirable exp tanks, helping their weakness with a spell from a class almost every balanced group seems to have will make them pretty powerful.<br />
<br />
<br />
And by your analogy if  Shaman and Enchanters get hit less when a warrior tanks I am guessing they have the spell on them too, which is another 300 mana a pop. Why bother when a tank with 100% lock guarantees that you only have to cast the spell on him/her? Knights become even more efficient in comparison lol.  Just can't win.</div></div><hr />

I usually only exp in Tier 4, but my guild was off doing a pickup raid that was going to last a while... <br />
<br />
Anyway, I have a BoW and 9650 hps.  I have 1831 AC.  Despite all of this, the enchanter felt like she had to get a slow in right away because our only healer was a druid.  The enchanter ended up dying a couple times because I was in group instead of a paladin.<br />
<br />
The enchanter didn't HAVE to slow so early.  The mobs were not hurting me so fast that the druid couldn't easily keep up, but people get used to doing what they do at a certain pace.  They don't like adjusting.<br />
<br />
I have no problem getting experience with my guild.  They know me, they love how well I tank, they adjust to me.  Joe Schmoes in some pickup group like to do things the way they always do.  They don't adjust very well.<br />
<br />
This is the problem.  Warriors are okay IF they have uber agro weapons, IF they have good offensive AAs to help hold agro, and IF they have a group that will adjust to a different playing style than a knight MA.  IF they don't, warriors aren't too nifty.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You all are so blindly convinced that it's so godly for hybrids, and it doesn't help us, then fine, go ahead, think what you want.<br />
<br />
Y'all are so upset that warrior issues aren't being adressed, you're looking at changes which beneift everyone, and seeing them as indirect nerfs to warriors... in fact you're seeing everything not as an upgrade, but how it's going to harm the warrior class.<br />
<br />
The plain an simple fact is this change benefits warriors just as much as any other class. Neither of you have said anything that invalidates that fact.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hulanta</div><div class="date">08-26-2003, 06:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh... what did my last post have to do with this thread?  Just that this spell won't help me unless I am MTing on UberMob_01 because I tank really well in an exp group, as a MA, and as a MT (but it will slightly help on some nasty mobs).<br />
<br />
It will easily help knights in exp groups.  They become easier to heal, which makes them more viable.  Making me easier to heal doesn't make me any more viable in an exp group.  I have had a shaman heal me for 20 minutes when the cleric went LD in PoFire and he did just fine.</div></div><hr />

Seriously kidding yourselves.  Is a 10% or 20% (the enchanters are getting a version that does a 20% damage reduction but costs a component) damage reduction going to significantly impact how well we tank an unslowed mob?  Well, some, certainly that's true.  And how will it impact how a Knight tanks a slowed mob?  Pretty significant increase I would think.  So who's HP bar is going to drop slower, a Warrior fighting an unslowed mob or a Knight fighting a slowed one?  If you make the Knight 10% or 20% better at taking damage from the slowed mob, you've removed any advantage the Warrior would have had without vie and you still have him dying a lot faster when trying to tank an unslowed mob in order to establish aggro.<br />
<br />
End result, even more reason to stick with a Knight, since aggro on demand is still so overwhelmingly beneficial, and no reason to consider the Warrior in his place except as a last resort.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hulanta</div><div class="date">08-26-2003, 06:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Daemonwynd, I don't have problems staying alive in an exp group.  I don't have many problems staying alive on a raid.  I do have problems keeping agro sometimes though.  Sure, this will help me tank even better, but I am okay right now anyway.<br />
<br />
Knights can hold agro no problem.  Now they will handle damage better as well.  This is useful to them because they could use help in this area.<br />
<br />
In other words, if you give $100 to me, I am very greatful because I can really use the money.<br />
<br />
If you give $100 to Bill Gates, he shrugs and says he doesn't really need it.<br />
<br />
Warriors don't need more mitigation per se, but knights do.  This change DOES NOT benefit warriors as much as any other class.<br />
<br />
Okay, I can put it another way.  If you take Superman and take away his problem with kryptonite, he becomes that much uber (like taking away some of the knights problem with being able to tank).<br />
<br />
If you take away Batman's problem with krytonite (he finds it mildly smelly and bothersome, but it doesn't sap his strength), then Batman is better off, but not nearly as much as Superman.<br />
<br />
It is not an indirect nerf to warriors.  However, it is of little benefit.  Whereas it has a significant benefit to knights.</div></div><hr />

The last time I checked, we were complaining that paladins could tank just about as well as we could, now we're busy making it look like they couldn't take a hit because it suits our purposes in screaming about this as an indirect nerf? Come on, people. Where's the &quot;reduce damage taken by use of stuns&quot;, &quot;use of fast heals, group heals, etc etc&quot; arguments now that we use when complaining about how paladins are no harder on the cleric than warriors are, as is?<br />
<br />
No. Paladins don't need the improved mitigation more that warriors as it is, they make up the difference in other ways, by healing their own damage, and/or stopping the damage from happening to begin with via stuns.Therefore, an equal boost to both paladins and warriors will BENEFIT BOTH EQUALLY.<br />
<br />
Secondly. Glatius.<br />
<br />
You keep comparing knights with vie to warriors without vie?<br />
<br />
My question is, who the fuck CARES about paladins with Vie and warriors without Vie? The fact is, just like any other tank buff, warriors will have Vie just as much as the paladins do. What's next, you're going to compare a paladin with virtue and a warrior without virtue and say that paladins have caught up in the hitpoint advantage warriors have? Ridiculous. Drop the damn &quot;paladin with Vie VS warrior without Vie&quot; comparison, as it paints a false picture of reality. What is it they call this? a &quot;strawman?&quot;<br />
<br />
Vie's going to be a huge benefit for those warriors without great gear, that are getting the crap kicked out of them in Valor and BoT, causing the poor chanter no end of grief as he has to slow the mob on inc.<br />
<br />
You say you don't need the mitigation upgrade, I say NOONE who is well equipped needs the mitigatiohn upgrade, and that goes just as well for paladins as for tanks. This, is a huge upgrade for the poorly equipped warriors, even over the poorly equipped paladins. <br />
<br />
You want to complain about paladins, how about you complain about something real, like the better buffs paladins get with LDoN, including a paladin version of Aegolism, and iof I recall correctly, a single target buff that is BETTER than Aegolism.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">08-26-2003, 06:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No Daemonwynd, your premise that all three classes will receive equal benefit is flawed.  It's based on the belief that all three classes are otherwise equally attractive to a group.  We know this is not true.  We know that the reason Knights are more attractive for a group currently is because of their on demand aggro generation abilities.   We know that Warriors can't match this ability.  We currently also know that Warriors tank about 10% better than a Knight already.  So, if this 10% advantage that we already have isn't sufficient to get us groups when balanced against the Knight's on demand aggro generation, how does it make any sense that suddenly we'll get groups for the exact same 10% advantage over a Knight we've always had?  The answer is, it doesn't.  Warrior will still continue to be passed over for groups and as a result won't gain any benefit from a buff that mitigates damage.  However, their on demand aggro generation will still get Knights groups, and they'll be taking 10% or 20% less damage on top of it.<br />
<br />
Final result, Warriors continue to LFG while Knights tank 10% or 20% better thereby continuing to lock up group MT slots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daemonwynd</div><div class="date">08-26-2003, 06:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My premise is not based on all 3 classes being equally wanted for groups. My premise is based on mathematics. 90(pally mitigation)/100(warrior mitigation) = 100(new pally mitigation)/110(new warrior mitigation) has a difference of UNDER  1%. Mathematically, the change between the old mitigation and new mitigation of the hybrids and warriors shows that hybrids get .9% better mitigation compared to warriors. And that, people, is pretty insignificant. You made a false assumption. That invalidates the rest of your argument.<br />
<br />
Your assertion that we won't get benefit from a mitigation spell because we're LFG and not taking damage in an experience group is terrible.<br />
<br />
The fact is, the addition of this spell is not going to make warriors less wanted. It will in fact not change a damned thing. It's not going to make us more wanted in experience groups, it's not going to make us less wanted in experience groups.<br />
<br />
You're misplacing your anger about this supposed &quot;nerf&quot; on to this new buff, when the real problem is where your anger should be directed to... warrior aggro issues. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaldanm</div><div class="date">08-26-2003, 06:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The point of glatius is that this spell will be relatively more beneficial to knights than warrior. <br />
<br />
What does this spell do if you cast it on a tank :<br />
- Allow knights to gain in mitigation.<br />
- Allow warriors to gain in mitigation.<br />
<br />
Basically, it add something to paladin they lack MORE than us. All xp spot an average warrior with 6k-6,5k buffed can tank today will be tankable by a 5,5k-6k paladin. it may trivialising mitigation.<br />
<br />
Of course warriors may gain even more mitigation. The actual debate to choose, for xp mobs, between :<br />
- A warrior with a good mitigation but a random aggro control.<br />
- Or a knight with a perfect aggro control but a 10% lesser mitigation<br />
With this spell it will be to choose between :<br />
- A warrior with a wonderful mitigation, but a random aggro control<br />
- A knight with a perfect aggro control and a good mitigation.<br />
<br />
<br />
The warrior major flaw is still there, where the knight one can be resorbed thanks to this spell. beside we can already have this wonderful mitigation even without this spell, it's called defensive/evasive.<br />
<br />
Of course if they balance content around encounters that require both Defensive AND Vie...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daemonwynd</div><div class="date">08-26-2003, 06:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">See above, Kaldan. The difference is UNDER one percent.<br />
<br />
And that's even assuming spell mitigation is taken into account before defensive skill mitigation is considered. If defensive mitigation is considered BEFORE spell mitigation, the warriors can actually get more benefit than the paladins.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">08-26-2003, 06:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes Daemonwynd, that is essentially my arguement.  This spell does nothing to increase Warrior group attractiveness because damage mitigation was never the reason we were passed up for groups, it was snap aggro.  Therefore introducing a buff that increases damage mitigation leaves the status quo the way it is, Warriors groupless, Knights grouped, but with Knights getting a 10% or 20% increase to damage mitigation.  The Knights reap the most advantage from it, because they'll be the ones seeing the most benefit.  It improves one of their weaknesses and leaves ours completely untouched.</div></div><hr />

Oh, I might have missed it but the wizard spell I believe is about being nuked, and does nothing to melee (in other words, 25% non-melee damage).  We'll see what happens when these go live I guess.<br />

It improves a weakness when you consider it in the most simple, pure numbers, and when you look at paladins only, and don't compare them to anyone else. However, RELATIVE to warriors, there is no improvement. They're still where they always were. <br />
<br />
When you have a co-worker who gets paid more than you, and you both get 10% raises, yes, you got an improvement in pay, however, relative to your higher paid co-worker, there was either no, or an insignificant improvement. Hell, the gap between you and your co-worker could easily increase, jsut like the mitigation gap coule increase, depending on how they calculated it.</div></div><hr />

This doesn't hurt warriors, and it doesn't help paladins much more than warriors, but with the agro difference (which is what I am &quot;screaming&quot; about I guess) paladins still get in groups and tank better.  Warriors DON'T get in groups, so they don't tank any better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Come on.... <br />
<br />
The way you're saying it, warriors are always LFG and paladins are always in groups... and the very fact of thier being LFG is part of the reason why they don't get the benefit that paladins do from it. Talk about putting the cart before the horse.<br />
<br />
All this spell's going to do overall, is preserve the way things are, it's not going to change the balance at all. Paladins get a VERY slight improvement to thier mitigation relative to warriors (at best, depends on how they calculate it), and warriors get a very slight and indirect improvement in the aggro area.<br />
<br />
It's not going to change the status quo. warriors maintain a mitigation/hp advantage, hybrids retain an aggro advantage, and hybrids will still be wanted over warriors in experience groups. Bleh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">08-26-2003, 07:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another way to look at it is like this.  Why might people have passed on a Knight previously?  Because they were concerned that the Knight might not be able to take the beating.  With this buff that concern is reduced, further removing any obstacle to taking the Knight.  Knights are plus on the desire-O-meter as a result.<br />
<br />
Since the concern with the Warrior was never really whether or not he could take the beating, you're not improving his position at all.  Warriors are neutral on the desire-O-meter, neither improved nor decreased, except in relation to their attractiveness to a Knight.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At that point, no, it's not helping that particular class... but due to the spell design, it's not harming the group, either.<br />
<br />
Hell, you could argue enchanters get the best benefit out of this... only having maybe 10-20% mitigation of the plate tanks, 20% spell mitigation represents a one or two HUNDRED percent increase in mitigation, where the plates only get 10 or 20%.<br />
<br />
If you want to spin it that way, chanters get 10 times the benefit as the plates.<br />
<br />
It all depends on how you want to spin it.<br />
<br />
You could also put the spin on it that pets are going to be more able to tank in PoP, too, making chanter soloing or even nonstandard group pet tanking much easiser.<br />
<br />
Wonder how else you could spin this spell negatively, when that negative spin really is no big deal iwhen translated into the game... /ponder</div></div><hr />

Don't be an ass.  It won't change the status quo in as much as Warriors still won't be desired for groups, Knights will still get more groups, and this won't change in the slightest.  What it will do, is if anyone had some hesitation about a Knight to begin with, they have even less reason for that now.  It will at a minimum buff up the Knight image a little more while doing nothing for Warriors.  Hell it might even get a few more Knights groups they wouldn't have gotten anyway.  I seriously doubt we can say the same for Warriors.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Which I covered earlier, thats more mana to cast on different classes, which means its even less effective to use a warrior, and instead of just casting it once on a class that can guarantee only he will get hit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You start out with a mob that deals 200 dps. Slow it with the best slow for 75% gimping it to 50 dps. Then stack on defensive for an additional 30% reduction leaving you with 35 dps then tack on the spells 20% for a total of 28 DPS. <br />
<br />
So in the end it would take off a measly 3.5% of the starting mob DPS for warriors under /disc ( assuming that it stacked perfectly ).</div></div><hr />

The question is what characteristic is a key limitation for Warriors and Knights is exp groups? For Knights it is HP's and mitigation. For Warriors it is aggro.<br />
<br />
Anyone (or apparently almost anyone) would admit this buff benefits Knights in an area that is (for them) a key limitation.<br />
<br />
A change that would have affected both equally would be perhaps a general 10% increase in DPS for 2HS weapons. That is not the kind of change we have here.<br />

I apologize if this was said before.  I know  Hoop (Hulanta) gets it as she had some nifty analogies but let me put it this way.<br />
<br />
IMAGINE...<br />
<br />
if this spell instead of 10% damage mitigation were a 10% 36 minute AGGRO INCREASER?<br />
<br />
Pal could increase aggro 10% and war could increase aggro 10%.<br />
<br />
Who would this benefit more?  The paladin, who is already adept at aggro, or the warrior who is not?<br />
<br />
DING<br />
<br />
THE WARRIOR<br />
<br />
Wars need more aggro, pals can use better mitigation.  Give us each a 10 percent  mitigation bonus and the warrior suffers from the law of diminishing returns (ie gets something that they don't really need) while the Pal has become a more well rounded xp group tank.<br />
<br />
Think about it LOL.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not. you're saying two different things on two different boards. There, you're saying this buff's not going to change the status quo. Here, you're arguing that it WILL change the status quo by making paladins even more wanted.<br />
<br />

<br />
No, it won't. Mark my words, and we'll see for ourselves soon... but watch, this doom and gloom of yours is simply not going to come true. Because you know what, everyone got the same upgrade. I'll share a little secret with you. Non melee don't see a significant difference in tankability between knights and warriors as it is... adding 10% mitigation to both is going to do absolutely nothing to change that.<br />
<br />
Hell, you can't even show any kind of proof on how this will magically make paladins even more wanted for groups, and warriors even less wanted. Whereas I've shown mathematical proof that the difference between  pre-Vie and post-vie mitigation, is insignificant.<br />
<br />
Kavak: That's not a new thing, that existed before the new mitigation buff. You can't attribute that problem to the new mitigation buff, because it existed previously, and for a different reason. I would, however, be interested in any proof that you can show that increasing mitigation across the board actually makes warriors less wanted in groups by those with less mitigation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daemonwynd</div><div class="date">08-26-2003, 08:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bad analogy, Buun.<br />
<br />
That would be assuming warriors are 90% as good as paladins in aggro.<br />
<br />
Warrior aggro is maybe half as good as a paladin, so add 50% + 10% = 60%, paladin 100% +10% = 110%, of course the warrior gets twice as much benefit from an across the board addition.<br />
<br />
Secondly, that would have to be 10% better aggro generation across the board, you're almost at where you were to begin with.<br />
<br />
Remember, ALL classes can have the benefit of this new mitigation.<br />
<br />
All this does is raise the bar across the board, for everyone. There's very very little relative changes for the plates.<br />
<br />
Increase damage by 10% across the board for everyone... and the only time there's a significant change is by those clases who do several TIMES the damage of other classes. Those that are close, the relative change is close to zero.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If this is true, then the 10% difference between Warriors and Paladins without vie is insignificant.  Please proceed to the Paladin board and explain that to the Paladins because a number of them see it as a huge advantage justifying Warriors being outcast enmass to the LFG pool.<br />
<br />
And my point is still the same.  This may be perceived as being good for Knights, but in no way can it be perceived as doing jack for Warriors.  At least not from the getting a group perspective.  You disagree.  You think it's completely nuetral in it's impact, I think it's at least slightly in our disfavor.  Can you honestly say you know the mind of every person who plays the game?  I can't.  But I do know human nature.  Anything that makes what you already prefer better, is a plus.  Anything that makes what you already don't prefer better, is irrelevant, unless the change is large enough to overcome your preference.  This isn't that large a change, ergo it does better things for Knights, because they're already preferred and this just reinforces that.<br />
<br />
But yes we'll see.  I'll be greatly surprised if we don't have a ton of Warriors screaming about how screwed up LDoN is for us within 30 days of release.  Want to take any bets?</div></div><hr />

<br />
If a warrior is the best mitigator and sets the bar at 100, then a paladin is somewhat less right?  Want to say 80?<br />
<br />
100+10 =110 not much mitigation war benefit<br />
<br />
80+10 = 90 significant mitigation benefit for pal<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kavak</div><div class="date">08-26-2003, 08:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If both knights and warriors get a 10% increase in migitation, the class that gets hit the most (hence keeping it off others) will get the biggest benefit. Why? Well simply because he is getting hit more and the 10% spell will be used more effectively. For one cast of the spell the knight can direct all the hate on to him. You can say aggro is a current problem and has nothing to do with this, but it does for the reason I mentioned. Aggro IS a part of tanking, a big part, and any upgrades are going to  de different for different classes (even if the same spell) because of that aggro. <br />
<br />
Yes a warrior can arguably get the exact same benefit (and hence no increase or decrease) from this spell, but it would require the spell cast on those who will potentially take aggro off the warrior, which costs more mana.<br />
<br />
This will widen the gap right now between the two classes as far as desirability goes as far as exp groups go (if it is indead nota  rune which would be more useless, and a 36 min effect). It could be very marginal, it could be significant, but really its not a different matter no matter how you look at it in my opinion.<br />
<br />
<br />
You cannot just say a spell that adds 10% will have the EXACT same effects on all classes, because there are more variables than just hp and ac and innate skills in this game. If that were so warriors would be the ultimate tank choice for any encounter, but they are not. It might be small, but its a difference none the less, and I do not seeing the difference being in the warriors favor from any angle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daemonwynd</div><div class="date">08-26-2003, 08:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's 90% for paladins.<br />

I already did the math farther up in the thread, Buun. The relative change is .909%.<br />

That's insignificant in day to day fighting, and only noticeable by parsing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also remember, that mitigation difference is going to help the casters if they get hit too.<br />
<br />
There's still no net difference here. Same damn thing as what's halways happened, just there's less damage being taken by everyone involved... and EVERYONE is taking the exact same less damage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When I play my cleric, I prefer the warrior.  Assuming he has a clue how to play his class and decent gear, warrior &gt; knight.  <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, when I play my shaman, I miss the knight.  It is more work to slow with a warrior tank.  There is a balance... you need to wait but the amount of time you need to wait varies a lot between warriors as does the amount of damage they can suck up before that slow really needs to hit.  With a knight, no thought it needed... mal on inc and slow as it hits camp then wait a sec to sit.  With a warrior tank I can't sit till half way through the fight which effects my mana as well.  I don't have a preference really - I'll group with either - but there is no question that for the slower it is easier to have a knight tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Graal the Dorf</div><div class="date">08-26-2003, 09:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Slight flaw in the math:<br />

90*1.1=99%<br />
<br />
99/110=90% of warrior mitigation.<br />

That's of course assuming that knights mitigation is 90% of warriors mitigation, but the point is that it will not change mitigation abilities of knights and warriors relative to each other.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You guys keep trying to brush off this added mitigation like it's not needed or not important, so somehow that invalidates the whole fact that it exists.<br />
<br />
Well, it does not change the fact it is there, and must be taken into consideration. Just like adding 10% to all heals, clerics didn't need better heals, so therefore the fact that they got an improvement doesn't matter, but for everyone else it somehow does matter.<br />
<br />
I agree with you, Kavak, that knights are picked over warriors due almost entirely to convenience considerations. This mitigation change isn't going to change that in the slightest. Paladins will still be chosen entirely for their aggro advantage, as they still will tank quite nearly as well as a warrior, so much so that most people can't tell the difference.<br />
<br />
Have you all not considered that this 10% mitigation increase means warriors can tank in higher level planes, on harder hitting mobs, sooner than they could previously? That's a benefit for warriors if I ever saw one.<br />
I, for one, am quite looking forward to the next mob that hits me for 1460 when they were supposed to hit for 1600.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The balance (or lack thereof) in tanking capability, between Knights and Warriors, will remain unchanged after the introduction of these spells.<br />
<br />
By all means we should continue to lobby for improvements to Warriors. We are the specialist tank, yet Knights do it better. This is not right.<br />
<br />
We should not however, be complaining about a spell given to Clerics, able to be cast on anyone for equal effect.</div></div><hr />

It's simply calculating differently. you're assuming that the mitigation increase is calculated from the class's mitigation, I'm saying it's completely seperate.<br />

Makes more sense for it to simply knock of 10% of every hit, and not add 10% to that classes's mitigation abilities.</div></div><hr />

But, as you argue it's the same exact benefit to the Knight, who can go up against harder hitting mobs earlier than before as well.<br />
<br />
If there are two cars on the market, one called Knight and one called Warrior.  And the market share showed that people think the Warrior model is poorly designed and doesn't perform well, while they believe the Knight model is well designed and performs very well.  What might they think if they heard both models were coming out with leather bucket seats as standard equipment?  <br />
<br />
Many people would think, wow, the Knight will now have leather bucket seats, cool.  While also thinking, so what if the Warrior has leather bucket seats, that car's a piece of crap anyway.<br />
<br />
Vie will be leather bucket seats.   Putting leather bucket seats on a popular model just improves its popularity.  Putting leather bucket seats on an unpopular model does little or nothing.</div></div><hr />

Actually, to be a true comparison would be to add the exact same thing to every car on the market. Call it 10% better mileage, or 10% off everything in the store, or whatever you want.<br />
<br />
If you add the same thing to everyone, then that car, or that item, will be chosen on its other merits. The fact that it got 10% better of something recently doesn't matter... cause... well... EVERYONE got 10% better at that.</div></div><hr />

You see the difference is its assumed all cars start off the same or their 10% has the exact same effect. In game a little thing called aggro messes up that equality in 10% comparisons.<br />
<br />
I would agree with you if both tanks could keep the mob on them all the time that it would be equal, or if the spell also added 10%-20% aggro to anyone it was cast on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
90% for knights<br />
and 100% for warriors?... right... ok... but... WHO CARES?<br />
<br />
when all that's needed to tank mobs properly is 80%...<br />
what are you going to choose?<br />
<br />
90% mitigation + 100% aggro?<br />
<br />
or 100% mitigation + 20% aggro?<br />
<br />
oh wait... now it's 100% for knights and 110% for warriors?... <br />
<br />
that heightens the cap for knights... making them able to tank stuff as well as warriors USED to tank....<br />
and we tank better too... but did we really need to tank better?<br />
<br />
especially considering how god damn weak the ldon mobs are?<br />
<br />
<br />
I ask you, where is the ldon spell thats going to up Warrior's ablity to get aggro?.... where is it? cmon, tell me.<br />
Everyone gets to tank better, but we still suck shit at aggro.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">corillis</div><div class="date">08-26-2003, 10:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Imagine this:<br />
<br />
Warrior tank:<br />
<br />
Mob inc. Slower gets aggro (we know this story)<br />
It takes some time to get the aggro back on the warrior.<br />
So, for a while, the healer (lets say a cleric) will have to heal both the slower, and because the aggro may jump back and fro a while, the warrior.<br />
<br />
Knight tank:<br />
<br />
Mob inc, mob on knight, all is well, flowers bloom, children across the world are happy.<br />
<br />
Now with the new spell:<br />
<br />
Warrior tank:<br />
<br />
Smart cleric casts the spell on the warrior.<br />
Mob inc.<br />
Warrior is, for a while, able to tank the mob unslowed.<br />
Slower slows a bit later, aggro remains on the warrior.<br />
Aggro builds up, group happy, exp flows.<br />
<br />
Knight tank:<br />
<br />
Smart cleric isn't going to waste his mana on the knight, so mob inc aggro on knight, slow on, flowers, children, you've heard the deal.<br />
<br />
------<br />
<br />
Basically, you cast this thing on a warrior, and the slower can slow a bit later. So, aggro remains on the warrior.<br />
<br />
Since a pally or sk has aggro lock, the cleric won't have to use this spell.<br />
<br />
&quot;But now the cleric has to spend more mana on a warrior tank than on a knight tank&quot;<br />
<br />
No, I don't agree, warriors are better tanks, thus require less healing.<br />
<br />
So, you see, I play a cleric. I play a warrior, I play a pally... I know what each class can do, I know where the imbalance lies.<br />
<br />
Instead of being SO ########ing negative about EVERYTHING, look at it from the bright side.<br />
This spell, if used correctly, may actually help warriors.<br />
<br />
But people have to use their minds. Use different strategies.<br />
<br />
It's as simple as a spell cast to prevent HAVING to slow early and putting an unneeded strain on the warriors already very limited ability to generate aggro at the beginning of the fight.<br />
<br />
I don't want to offend anyone, but I don't like people who only whine. Make the best of things. I thought warriors were die-hards. Don't make Knights laugh at you when you can show 'em who's the REAL tank around.</div></div><hr />

Both warriors and palis will get the same benfit. However you cant just use numbers, perception is everything. As a group member I know palis have snap argo, great I am in very little danger and now I can count on palis being 10% better at taking dammage. Now im really happy. That warrior taking 20% less dammage means nothing to me because I believe snap argo and 10% less dammage is far more useful. They may be wrong but will still believe what their perception tells them. So while both knights and warriors recive the same numbers benfit. The perception wont even be close.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">08-27-2003, 01:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Umm guys, you all are doing the mitigation improvement backward, since the most mitigation you can get is 100% (would a 101% improvement mean the mobs heals you for 1% of its damage?).<br />
<br />
So the way to talk about it is warriors take 100 damage, paladins take 110. 10% mitigation improvement subtracts from the the damage taken, so warriors would take 90, paladins 99 (assuming we use the pally figure of taking 10% more damage). So paladins have a larger absolute gain in tanking.<br />
<br />
As for the reletive balaces between classes, while not drastically changing things, it does favor knights over warriors. <br />
<br />
With their better agro control casters can seriously consider casting this on one character only. It makes the knight a better rounded tank while making us even more specalized.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">08-27-2003, 01:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Daemonwynd, I guess that's the diference of opinion. ATM I exp in ToSolRo for the loot (Ornate Molds) and PoEarthA for fast exp.<br />
<br />
Because the mobs hit pretty hard for a Knight (some can handle it) I frequently MT in Earth. But in ToSolRo a Warrior is not required. As a result I get a lot fewer groups there.<br />
<br />
People do not do the hardest content possible, they do the content that gives them the greatest reward for the least risk.<br />
<br />
A 10% improvement in damage reduction doesn't mean doing harder mobs with a Warrior in exp groups, there is no good reason to do so. But it might mean using a Paladin or SK as MT in a LDoN dungeon crawl or in a zone that formerly required a Warrior.<br />

Yes Warriors will tank better<br />
Yes Paladins will tank better<br />
Yes the War vs Paladin tanking balance will be preserved<br />
<br />
Guess what  ?<br />
<br />
NO one FUCKING CARES how well we tank in xp.<br />
NO one FUCKING CARES how well the paladin tanks in xp.<br />
<br />
ALL THEY CARE ABOUT IS THE AGRO LOCK.<br />
<br />
Guess what ?<br />
<br />
This spell does absolutely nothing to us since<br />
- We already tank well in xp (10% more HP wont make me a better xp tank)<br />
- We have a huge bonus when things get bad or named (see disc)<br />
<br />
This spell does some thing to the paladin<br />
- They already tank well in xp (10% more HP wont make them better tanks)<br />
- THEY GET A FUCKING DEFENSIVE LIKE CLONE BUFF<br />

<br />
When i want some damage mitigation i use my disc.<br />
Paladins had ABSOLUTELY NO WAY of getting that extra mitigation<br />
<br />
Yes we will have that 10% bonus but guess what..<br />
<br />
YOU JUST GAVE 10% MITIGATION TO WARS WHEN THEY ALREADY HAD 40%<br />
<br />
YOU JUST GAVE 10% MITIGATION TO PALS WHEN THEY HAD 0%<br />

Do you realise that  0% -) 10% is MUCH MUCH MORE POWERFULL than 40 -) 50% ?<br />

Now they do, its the Vie line spells.<br />

<br />
My disc will get +10 point incease in power (big deal its already overpowered)<br />
His disc ? Well he just got ONE<br />

<br />
Now take a  example for this:<br />
<br />
Lets assume <br />
<br />
warrior is 100g (tanking ability) bread knight is 90g bread with jam ( 90% tanking ability, jam is snap aggro)<br />
<br />
Each day we take a piece of bread as breakfast. (refer to group need a tank)<br />
<br />
Majority of ppl would take bread with butter since its enough to feed their stomach and tastly jam on it(Knight can tank in Exp situation well and provide excellent aggro management)<br />
<br />
While a few people know that they will have a tough day. In order to feed the stomach to go through a tough day, they choose a lager piece of bread (raid situation choose warrior as MT)<br />
--------------------------------------------------<br />
Now a new techology come and increase the side of bread 10 %<br />
(refer to spell)<br />
<br />
Now warrior  is 110 g bread<br />
         knight is  99 g bread with jam<br />
<br />
The ppl who used to choose the bread with jam will think &quot;Nice, now I can  surely feed my stomach and the bread taste good&quot;. (This make knight even more group attractive and let knight can survive in tougher situation than now)<br />
<br />
The ppl used to choose 100 g bread now think &quot;why dont i choose the bread with jam, it just small a bit  than 100 g bread but have a tasty jam on it&quot; . Part of the ppl with turn down the 110g and choose 99g bread with jam. ( Warrior  remain no Xp group and even lose advantage in raid as the boss and mob attack power remain the same)<br />
-------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
In conclusion, this spell do improve warrior more by 1 % but overrall effects turn to knight  favor. This dont make warrior life go easily or even worse.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's a slow spell that's cast on the tank rather than the critter.<br />
<br />
Okay, there are differences.  It stacks with normal slows; it causes zero aggro; it's unresistable; it's only 10%.  But, its function is to be the clerical answer to slow.<br />
<br />
It's not defensive.  It reduces the amount of damage a tank takes without reducing the amount of damage or taunt that they put out; it stacks with warrior disciplines.<br />
<br />
It's not a heal improvement.  Mitigating 1600 damage for 300 mana isn't going to push the clerics' buttons, I do assure you.  As far as I can see, its function is to smooth out damage spikes, and its use in practise is likely to be situational at best.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When I take a warr and a Pal in a Zone Tier 3  for tanking.<br />
<br />
The warrior gets smacked over time for 50.000 Damage ( to get some numbers )<br />
The paladin gets smacked over the same time for 50.000 Damage + 10 % ( lesser migration ) = 55.000 Damage.<br />
<br />
None of the exp mobs is hitting more than 1600 a hit.<br />
<br />
So I do the math. <br />
<br />
The spell cuts of 10 % of the damage taken.<br />
Warrior = 5.000 Damage by that spell migrated<br />
Paladin = 5.500 Damage by that spell migrated<br />
<br />
looks better for the palli I think.<br />
<br />
Why does this all do not benefit the warrior.<br />
<br />
Oh very simple. Now ppl. say &quot; Hey lets go to XXX .... but mobs hit so hard better take a warrior cause of better migration/HP &quot;<br />
<br />
Then ... &quot;Hey lets go to XXX ... but take a Knight for the better aggro.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dang one more exp place lost for a warrior cause of the better defense possibilities knights are gaining.<br />
<br />
I wonder that all the knights can't see it. I see then writing that - wenn warr will be given aggro near to them - they would be again useless in groups. But when they get same or nearer defense its without a meaning and changes nothing.<br />
<br />
A bit strange, isn't it?</div></div><hr />

It work the exact same way defensive is working. Defensive IS used to reduce spike. or you could say its a sort of slow... This is just semantics.<br />
<br />
This spell have the SAME kind of effect. defensive is reducing DI by 50%, those spell by 10 to 25%, that's it ?<br />
<br />
I know it is a rune... but how long does it last against a 500 hitter ? one minute ? I will glady pay 3 peridots and a few of my cleric mana for a demi-defensive. I suppose anyone who want to tank will.<br />

<br />
I'm looking forward to these spells, just because they'll give me a slight edge against the only xp group mobs that give me any concern, krigers.  Other than that, I'll just deal.  It isn't unusual for me to be sitting in BoT lfg with 2 or 3 other 65 tanks anyway.  As it is, I pretty much assume that I won't get a group until all the knights get one, so this won't change a thing on that score.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because the level at which people get exp from MOBS is fixed, there is a declining marginal benefit to extra mitigation in exp groups. Since warriors have more mitigation, they benefit less. It's pretty simple.<br />
<br />
20% more aggro or 20% more mitigation? Which would knights prefer? Which would warriors prefer? Who just got what they wanted?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Just redid the test 3 times post patch - and now I am not sure what happened pre-patch.<br />
<br />
The buff drops once it has adverted 1600 dmg - ie, once you have taken roughly 14400 dmg (as 14400+1600 = 16000 and 10% of 16000 is 1600).<br />
<br />
That obviously lowers it usefullness tremendeously - though I still see some usefullness in it - but its definitely situational.<br />
<br />
con:<br />
- takes a buff slot<br />
- takes a spell slot<br />
- only 1600 healed for 300 mana (and in abjuration)<br />
<br />
pro<br />
- its a non-aggro &quot;heal&quot;<br />
- it stacks with normal heals<br />
- it &quot;heals&quot; even when you are not in range or otherwise unable to heal<br />
<br />
<br />
I am very sorry I seem to have bugged the first test somehow. Still not sure what happened as I took significantly more damage and still had the buff on. Seeing I now got the same result 3 times in a row it has to have been a fluke - which might even have been fixed somehow by the patch.<br />

So chain it, and suddenly you can chain Vie a knight and get a defensive knight with better aggro capabilities.<br />

It's not the end of the world for warriors, true.<br />
<br />
But it's certainly not good news for warriors either.<br />
<br />
With the amazing, class balance altering spells that hybrids and casters have, it makes you wonder what the pure melees are even in the game for anymore.<br />
<br />
DPS? Who needs rogues and monks? get wizards and rangers.<br />
<br />
Pulling? Who needs monks? Get an SK, a Bard, a Cleric, a Paladin, an Enchanter or if your're outdoors a Druid or a Ranger.<br />
<br />
Tanking? Who needs warriors? Just get a knight.<br />
<br />
Perhaps this IS the melee balance that SOE has had planned all along. By making ALL THREE of the melee classes excessively weaker and even more useless, they are now balanced against EACH OTHER.<br />

You want to chain cast a 300 mana spell in an xp group? get real, no cleric worth anything would do that, it would be a waste.<br />
<br />
Now in a raid? Sure it would be chain cast on the warrior. Its a powerful raid spell, take the enchanter version which I believe is 20% add in shielding mods and your talking about a lot of damage taken off and thats without defensive going.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It costs me 300 mana IN my specialization to heal 1200 over time (well, 1500 for me because of SCR3 and 1800 if I had SCRM).<br />
<br />
How exactly does this spell change anything? Consensus amongst people I've talked to is its unlikely this will see heavy use.<br />
<br />
Admittedly, I might use it on the main tank just as a way of evening out the damage, but thats because I have a ton of mana most of the time (as long as we have a slower). But this is NOWHERE near what you guys were afraid it was (thank goodness!).<br />
<br />
To repeat: this spell is not as a good at 65th as just casting Celestial Elixir (not to mention complete heal or any one of our number of other heals).<br />
<br />
N.B.: now that I think about it, I'd almost certainly just cast this on off tanks and myself -- that way when they need the healing, its there for them but I don't have to worry QUITE so much about them getting beaten down. Or cast on monks for pulls.</div></div><hr />

And the buff fades after 16000 dmg done<br />
<br />
(So 8 hits of 2000, will be reduced to 8 hits of 1840 and buff gone)<br />
(So 24 hits of 500, will be reduced to 25 hits of 450 and buff gone)<br />
(So 100 hits of 160, will be reduced to 100 hits of 144 and buff gone)<br />
<br />
On a raid mob thats usually 10-20 hits.... <br />
Something around 5-15 seconds usually (thx to spikes)<br />
<br />
Get 3 clerics to chain cast this with 8 sec interval ....<br />
<br />
Considering a MT will get about 2 hits per second ....<br />
You just lowered the mobs DPS by 320 for a ridicule amount of mana.<br />
Thats of course with a perfect setup.<br />
<br />
3 clerics chain casting this spell (hence replaced by droods in CH line)<br />
Will lower the mobs DPS by 150-200 .....<br />
<br />
Thats A LOT for 1 single buff (i said buff not debuff)....<br />
<br />
This is gonna be the most game breaking spell after slow.<br />
<br />
Lowering DPS (and spikes) is much more powerfull that boosting healing.<br />
<br />
So this spells actually will &quot;give&quot; from 200 to 1000 hp to the raiding tank.<br />
(Since it will lower mob DPS, hence bigger pauses/halts between<br />
CH or more security)<br />

<br />
It costs me 300 mana IN my specialization to heal 1200 over time (well, 1500 for me because of SCR3 and 1800 if I had SCRM).<br />
<br />
How exactly does this spell change anything? Consensus amongst people I've talked to is its unlikely this will see heavy use.<br />
<br />
It is NOT a heal. Based on your logic you could say actual runes are pre-heals, and slow and 75% heals ? I'll consider a heal as efficient as this spell if you can insta-heal someone 300 damage every time a mob is hitting him.<br />
This spell reduce damage taken the exact same way defensive do : IT CAN PREVENT A TANK DYING FROM SPIKES, wich IS the point of using defensive. Sure, a warrior with this AND defensive will have insane mitigation. but is it needed ? maybe in LDoN...<br />
<br />
Remeber all previous content is tuned for mobs (and bosses) that hit for a given amount. this spell allow a sort of mini perma-defensive, or an extended defensive. now, talk about mudflation...<br />
<br />
I just think its another nifty effect SOE thought to add as a spell. The spell mitigation didnt exist previously. The reflect spell didn't exist too. This one is just a lower and limited version of something used to define the warrior class. still as it is there will be a way to use it in the same way defensive is used.<br />
<br />
Edit : ok lets wait LDoN is out and examine the true effect on this spell then. Maybe they are thinking about tuning it. but if it work as it seems and if there is way to use it as I think... you'll see our point.</div></div><hr />

It will indeed have some uses on raids, and will indeed make somethings (most things?) easier. But its not like you're going to have paladins tanking mobs just because of this spell.</div></div><hr />

Might be even more powerful, 2x.<br />
<br />
But yeah that would put this spell in the top 5 most powerful in game for sure.  Not sure it would beat out Slow, but it might rival CH for 2nd/3rd most powerful in game.</div></div><hr />

Other than that, it should be the exact same.  I don't think you can have both on at the same time tho, being as they are in the same slot.<br />

I suspect these spells will be given a longer refresh time somewhere around 1 to 3 minutes eventually to prevent you from chain casting them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khumak</div><div class="date">08-28-2003, 02:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The degree to which these lines of spells will reduce damage isn't the concern for warriors in xp groups.  The concern is that both warriors and knights already take damage efficiently enough for any xp group situation.  Warriors are a little more efficient at it but not enough to matter.  Knights have nearly flaweless aggro control.  Warriors don't.  Because of this knights are preferred in an xp group.<br />
<br />
In a raid situation this spell line won't matter unless it's going to be significant enough to compete with the warrior defensive discipline.  If it is then you may as well just officially declare warriors obsolete.  Just make a popup for all warriors to switch to an SK or Paladin next time they log in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">08-28-2003, 07:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Um no for the raid situation you will just cast this spell on whoever's tanking, especially with its current fast recast.  Taking 1600 damage is 1600 damage whether it's on a warrior or a Knight or a Wizard.  If this spell somehow makes fights trivially easy, people will still rather prefer to use a warrior to make it ridiculously trivial so people can just go afk or something rather just sort of trivial with a Knight.  The whole reason why Knights are even considered for tanking over Warriors in raid mobs is because mobs are NOT trivial so you want to end this as soon as possible.  <br />
<br />
Unless this rune makes it trivial for a Knight to tank, in which case it doesn't matter anyway because the fight is trivial, Warrior will benefit more than Knights.  No one's going to say, &quot;Okay we had problem keeping up a warrior reliably on this guy, but now with this Rune we'll put a Paladin instead and see if we can kill him 1 minute faster which everyone banging their nukes as fast as possible.&quot;  No people are going to say, &quot;Let's put this Rune on our warriors so he doesn't die, then we have all the time we need to kill this guy.&quot;  Warrior beats Knights hands down the safer a fight gets until it becomes trivial (then it does not matter).  Would you rather be in a position where you can't lose (Warrior with super rune) and kill the mob slowly, or a position where you can kill the mob fast but may lose (Knight with super rune)?</div></div><hr />

<br />
May I ask why you prefer a warrior with your cleric? I typed out a long post then realised I did not know why you preferred one with a cleric specifically ^_^  <br />
<br />
Sorry for the long delay answering.  I wish I had seen your long post so I'd better know what to answer.  :)<br />
<br />
As a cleric, I like healing a warrior.  I have CH - it is for the most part what makes me a cleric kinda like defensive makes the warrior; we love and hate it at the same time.  But since I have CH and since I've been told as a cleric every time I want anything else that I have CH so I don't need anything else (wow that sounded whiney... I'm really not whining just not sure how else to put it.  I love being a cleric and don't want to be anything else but I do see problems with the cleric class I wish would be addressed), I want to USE that CH to its full potential.  <br />
<br />
Due to AA, my heal over time (HOT) heals 4k HPs.  The HOT and the CH are both 400 mana.  So the most efficient heal I have really isn't the most efficient unless I'm healing for over 4k HPs with it.  When I'm healing a knight, I am lucky to get a 5k CH.  Granted there are knights with way more HPs than that but not the ones I normally play with.  When I play with a warrior I consistantly get 5k+ and sometimes 6k+ and sometimes even a full 7.5k CH from it.  That might not sound very exciting to you but I grew up in the days before KEI when mana efficiency was everything and so it is just the way I automatically think.  I'm not someone who plays the purple club game - that is more inefficient 'cause you end up needing to waste time rezing and rebuffing.  But I do like to get as much out of each cast as I safely can and for that I enjoy the warrior.<br />
<br />
Also... and this is sorta a funny/silly reason... think about what races can play paladins and what races play warriors.  Most warriors are BIG and it just feels sorta nice having something that large between me and the bad guy.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">08-28-2003, 07:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A 4K CH is more than enough for any kind of XP groups.  Warriors are not more efficient for heals compare to Knights if you can get at least 4K on a CH.  Of course you can get more than 4K, but there's really no reason to.  The only way you can consistently get 4K+ heals is either the mobs are so pitifully weak (or your tanks are ridiculous good), in that case xping is trivial anyway whether you're healing at 4K or 7.5K.  If such a group isn't having mental breakdown with aggro mangement you can be sure you will run out of mobs to kill, which neutralizes the HP advantage (could've had someone with less HPs and still finish the clear).  Actually, DPS both negates Warrior HP advantage and Knights aggro advantage simply because no more mobs means no amount of HP/aggro is going to help anyway.  <br />
<br />
Or this means the mob hits hard enough for you to constantly get such heals, and in that case one of these days your tank is probably going to die anyway.  Anything that hits hard enough for me to actually need a 7.5K heal can kill me, and it is not a good idea to be relying on such heals to survive.</div></div><hr />

I'll just leave it at my original statement which was that if I'm on my cleric I prefer a warrior tank.  My reasoning may be completely illogical or inexplainable but it is my personal preference.   Odd that a warrior would try to convince me I'm wrong.  :/</div></div><hr />

<br />
Speaking as an exp group cleric, I'm going to disagree with that.<br />
<br />
There's nothing magic about the figure of 4k.  Personally I can CH for 8700.  Although I've yet to land a CH for much in an exp group, I'd love to do so; because there are plenty of other things I can do with my mana.<br />
<br />
The only way you can consistently get 4K+ heals is either the mobs are so pitifully weak (or your tanks are ridiculous good), in that case xping is trivial anyway whether you're healing at 4K or 7.5K. If such a group isn't having mental breakdown with aggro mangement you can be sure you will run out of mobs to kill<br />
<br />
Personally, my preferred exp spots are the undead in HoH or CoD.  Against those, I have two primary ways of dealing damage.  First, I can cast a mana-free DoT spell for 125/tick (which is 20 DPS), which I need to refresh every 36 seconds, with a casting time of 9 seconds.  A high-hp tank enables me to keep Dawncall on the undead 100% of the time.<br />
<br />
Second, I can cast Destroy Undead, which deals 1200 damage for 300 mana; since there's a -100 resist check on that spell, it rarely gets resisted and I've never seen an xp mob resist it even partially.  With Fury of Magic, that spell criticals 10% of the time.  Therefore, every 300 mana is 1,320 damage to the critter.<br />
<br />
Fighting the knights in CoD, I've never yet run out of pulls, despite some groups with very aggressive chain-pull tactics.  Fighting the valiant/valorous spirits in HoH, you can run out of undeads easy enough, in which case you need to pull wrulons or guards for a while; I'll try to manage things so that I finish an undead spawn cycle on 20% mana and med through the live targets.<br />
<br />
If I have undead targets with a max hit in the 500's and an exp group tank at around 8khp, I can produce a sustained 60 DPS or more.  Give me a 5khp tank and I'll struggle to do 40.<br />
<br />
Actually, DPS both negates Warrior HP advantage and Knights aggro advantage simply because no more mobs means no amount of HP/aggro is going to help anyway.<br />
<br />
Where are you exping that you're running out of mobs all the time?  I'm genuinely curious.<br />
<br />
_____________________________________________<br />
<br />
I'm not trying to say that warriors are balanced against knights in terms of exp groups; you only have to listen to what the INT casters say when you suggest a warrior tank to understand that there are serious issues.<br />
<br />
I am trying to say that more HP matters.  Really.</div></div><hr />

Um, you might want to get a Paladin to MT for you. In addition to all their other advantages, they are somewhat *cough* more effective against undead than other tanking classes. Since they share this with Clerics I'm sure you are very familiar with their spells. Add to this Cleanse and I'm sure that the DPS output will more than compensate for 600-800 fewer HPs.<br />

Well Battleblade, my closest tank friends in game are warriors (plus one very special shadowknight).  I haven't abandoned them just because paladins are the top dogs this expansion.<br />
<br />
Besides, warriors always seem to talk as if they live on a server where there's always a nice wide choice of level 65 tanks sitting around looking for groups, so clerics there can go, &quot;Hmm.  No, you're too ugly.  You're wearing pink, so you're out... ah yes, I see that Lady Noblemace is LFG.  SU3 paladin, I choose you!!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
I'd like to transfer to this server please.  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Another note, I picked up my first 8700 CH the other night in Tier 1 Time.  Was quite an interesting fight, cleric had to chain CH me w/o any patching, and I was going berserk on every CH.<br />
<br />
And yeah, a SU3 Paladin is 100x better than a warrior for any undead exp group.  They should be about half this good vs undead compared to a war, and worse than wars in normal exp groups.  Too bad that's not generally true.<br />
<br />
My fingers have worn raw lately trying to hold aggro in exp groups against rogues with 19/20 daggers, BSTs who slow/debuff at start of fight, wizards who overnuke, mages who overnuke, druids who overnuke/debuff, Paladins who stun, SK's who debuff/taunt, and shaman who debuff at start of fight.... taunt seems to work about 50% of the time, maybe.  Procs seem to work about 10% of the time, maybe.  Paladin stun/taunt works 100% of the time and SK taunt/debuffs work about 90% of the time.<br />
<br />
It's funny when clerics have better taunt than warriors...</div></div><hr />

Where did you come to the conclusion that this spell would reduce the mob dps by 20%? all it does is reduce the first 1600 damage done by 20% that doesn't equate to the same percentage reduction of dps</div></div><hr />

<br />
reduces that damage until the total damage reduction reaches 1600, then the buff fades. In essence, it drops the first 8000 damage done by 20%.<br />
<br />
And, yes, Emilia, this is going to comparatively trivialize a lot of raid content.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">08-28-2003, 06:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">With enough Enchanters you can just keep the Rune forever.  However, it's not really 20% because the Rune only absorbs a max of 160 damage.  Still, reducing each hit by 160 is huge.  You'd need all the shielding items in Time to get that kind of effect.<br />
<br />
I mainly XP in BoT or PoEarth.  I see no practical advantage getting more than 4K out of a CH.  I need 1 CH per fight and even if that becomes 1 CH per 2 fights it's not going to improve the group DPS by any noticeable margins.  I guess the average LFG warriors take more damage than that, but when you reach a certain amount of mitigation/HP it doesn't really matter who's tanking anymore.  Heck an Enchanter can tank most stuff by chain casting Arcane Rune.  A parse in FoH shows a slowed HoH mobs doing only 50 DPS to a monk.  That's 200+ seconds you can go without heals on a similarly high end warrior, and even if you're at half that level, 100 seconds is still a long time.  XPing certainly isn't hard enough to actually require that much extra HP.  At any rate, more aggro is more useful than merely more HPs on XP mobs, even though you shouldn't need such aggro to XP.</div></div><hr />
