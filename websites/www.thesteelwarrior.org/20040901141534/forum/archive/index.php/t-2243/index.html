<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>arbosch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">After reading that much bullshit about warriors and paladins i need to make some things clear which most idiots here dont see.<br />
<br />
1.) Wapon balance. Everyone which say paladin have better wapons then warriors is an idiot. Everyone which say paladins dont get wapons easier as warriors is an idiot.<br />
<br />
Pre PoP paladins came near warriors dps because we got better wapons then warriors. PoP moved back to kunark and gave all the same wapions which was a big downfall in Paladins dps against warriors. High end paladin have a way lower dps then highend warriors. The situation is total fucked up now. Paladins get a lot of wapons easy and so the masses of paladins have better wapons then warriors. But for the highend paladins there is no real upgrade in there dps in PoP. To balance this verant need to put in a lot more warrior only wapons which are easy to get BUT has to upgrade the paladins highend wapons to. On that way the masses of warriors get wapons which are like goldenrod for paladins and can keep there dmg advantage against paladins and paladins can get a dps upgrade with PoP.<br />
<br />
2.) Taunting. Everyone which say warriors dont have a problem with taunt is an idiot. Everyone which say warrior should get aggro like knights and not give up something is an idiot.<br />
<br />
I agree that warriors need and upgrade how they taunt. BUT they need to give back the paladins/sk something. If warriors will taunt as good or near as good as the knights. Knights need to tank bossmobs near as good as warriors and this ONLY happen if knights get a defensiv discipline. Both sides win something with it and it will keep the balance. If you will keep it like it is now that warrior are the only possible tanks for bossmobs. Knights need to keep be the only real tank which can take aggro without problems. This is the balance between the tank classes. Warriors mainclass for raids without an real replacement. Knights for groups. And people which say 'but, but paladin can tank'. I answer with this 'but, but, warrior can taunt'. Dont mean it is effecitv and paladin tank bossmobs as good as warrior taunt.<br />
<br />
3.) Hps. It is true that warrior dont have a big advantage over knights. But there are roques which has more hps then paladins. At the moment the situation is total fucked up. They need to downgroad all classes if they will balance it. To get paladins/sk less hps dont help because we have allready less hps then some non tank classes. This is a death end. To give warriors more hps is allso not an option because it will throw the balance out of window for the PvE encounter.<br />
<br />
4.) Equipment. It has a lot to do with hps but was most warriors dont see is that paladins dont get the same upgrade from there equipment as warriors. As paladin i am not happy with our high end gear. For warrior it is easy. They need hps, resists, ac and melee improvments. Casters need hps, mana, resists, ac, wis or int and flowing thought and casting effects. Knights need all. If we get something without wis we lower our casting side. If we get something with focus effects and low ac we lower our tanking side. Warrior look at it if is a double win to get something to. This is wrong. Warriors get with every item and upgrade on all there mainstats. Knights dont get this. We dont get a 100% upgrade with every item on our stats. Lets take as example the Greaves of Furious Might. Warriors did cry to see that it is not warrior only and think it is godlike for paladins. Warrios get a 100% upgrade in all there mainstats. Paladins dont have a focus effect. So no upgrade to our casting side. Less mana so lower upgrade on our casting side. No flowing thought. No upgrade for our casting side. That is the same 100% upgrade for us like for warriors it need flowing thought V an effect which help our casting side and allso 210 mana. At the moment paladins allways need to make the decision if they will upgrade there casting or there melee side and lower the other side.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1) It's weapons, not wapons. And the way it is now, knights get pratically ALL the weapons warriors do PLUS tons of paladin/sk only weapons.<br />
AND, the 1handed weapons knights get have SICK ratio, to compensate the lack of dual wield.<br />
AND warriors have to give up dps on weapons in order to get Aggro... thus reducing the difference in dps.<br />
There is this sweet sword called SEWS, which most warriors cant dream of getting before knights.. .because they have a BoW waiting for them... but its so sickenly rare that not all warrs will get.<br />
So knights get priviledged once again...<br />
<br />
<br />
2)Why should we give paladins anything for aggro?.. I don't get it... Aren't you happy with your spell book? your LoH? your ability to solo undead with ease?...<br />
We just want a small upgrade to go from NOTHING to good aggro and you want paladins to get something in return?<br />
<br />
<br />
3) Rogues with more hp then a paladin?... are you comparing the same levels?<br />
You compare knight/warrior of the SAME level and SAME equipment, and the difference is very VERY small....<br />
compare knight with any other class, and they have a clear advantage in hp/ac.<br />
Actually, the way it is now, knights have an advantage over warriors on AC.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
4) Equipment... haha... paladins can get focus effects, FT, hp, ac, mana, ALL from the current equipment in PoP.<br />
You basically get NO downside, NO secondary effects of needing mana and hp.. because you get BOTH with EASE.<br />
Half if not more, of a warrior's equipment has mana on it.<br />
the ring from Kriziik even has to be abandoned by warriors, due to FT on it, making it better for knights... yet it has all the stats a warrior would dream of... but it goes to knights...<br />
<br />
<br />
5)The grass may not be greener on the other side... <br />
but we got a small patch of green grass, while you guys got a whole forest.<br />
<br />
6) You're an idiot</div></div><hr />

<br />
If your gonna smoke shit, at least share it with the rest of us.<br />
<br />
Give knights defensive, and you will acomplish one  thing, you will make warriors totally redundant from the game.<br />
<br />
Balance, what balance, i dont see any balance currently from where im standing. <br />
<br />
The top knight in my guild has 600hp less than our top warrior, and 100 times better aggro. Exactly how balanced is that ?<br />
<br />
You my friend are the typical Paladin, whos spends 99% of his time with his thumb up his ass, and has no clue of the issues that warriors face on a daily basis.<br />
<br />
Go away, and play a warrior for 65 levels and then you might just get a clue of how unbalanced we are.<br />
<br />
:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Outhouse incoming!Both sides win something with it and it will keep the balance.More like you win something because if you do tank as well as us, taunt as well as us, you still have that thing called utility that we can't ever hope to touch with how the game is today. Don't sit there and try to discount any semblence of your utility not mattering in the big scheme of things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tugurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yeah, let's look at the Greaves of Furious Might:<br />
<br />
MAGIC ITEM LORE ITEM NO DROP<br />

<br />
Looks like all plate classes can wear. So Paladins get 100% of every stat on that piece that warriors get, which means that the *proportional distance* between warriors and paladins got smaller, in several attributes at once. When a paladin equips this piece, as with every all/all piece, he reduces the distance between himself and a warrior even farther in the only respects warriors have any reason to even be around.<br />
<br />
Say you have 2 of something and I have 1 of something. Wow! You have 100% more than me! Now add 100 to both of us. Whoops! Now you only have a little less than 1% more than me. This is what happens with every sweet all/all piece out there. <br />
<br />
But wait! That's not all. He *also* gets substantial improvements to his mana pool, which of course means bupkis to warriors. <br />
<br />
So this paladin is bitching about a drop which benefits him disproportionately relative to warriors in every melee stat AND gives him mana, because it doesn't ALSO have a focus effect?<br />
<br />
Wah wah wah.<br />
<br />
By the way, I'm curious what paladins gave up for the following:<br />
<br />
1. Removal of experience penalty<br />
2. Expansion of mana pool<br />
3. Increase in defensive abilities<br />
4. Improved 2h damage<br />
5. Improved itemization<br />
6. New and improved spells (stackable hps, haste, new stuns, better rez, fast heals, group heals, etc, etc)<br />
<br />
All of this is of course in addition to generalized expansion of caster power with the proliferation of mana regen spells lasting up to 4 hours, and FT items.<br />
<br />
Gave up nothing whatsoever? I didn't think so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Welcome troll.  Hopefully this will be your only visit, as you add zero  to any discussion here, and are pretty obviously just trolling.  I will respond to only one thing, since some other knights have said similar.<br />
<br />
I agree that warriors need and upgrade how they taunt. BUT they need to give back the paladins/sk something <br />
<br />
Huh?  Knights, whom no one considers at all broken currently, need to get upgraded in order for warriors to simply get fixed?  Simply put, no.<br />
<br />
Warriors mainclass for raids without an real replacement. Knights for groups. <br />
<br />
Totally false argument.  Warriors have 1 role for raids(MA), we do nothing else with any great contribution.  If we are not MA we offer low DPS and subpar off tanking.  Pallies offer group heals, buffs, low DPS and awesome off tanking.  SK's offer buffs, FD pulling, potentially better DPS and awesome off tanking.  Just because 1 warrior is standing at the front of the raid, at the center of attention does not  mean that warriors have the key raid role.  Imortant, yes.  No more improtant tho than every one else who does their role to make the raid succeed.  <br />
<br />
Warriors get a bit of glory tho, a few minutes at the center of attention.  This does not seem at all unfair for giving up all traces of utility to be a total specialist.  But because you are so jealous  of that bit of glory, you are willing to relagate us to 3rd string exp tanks.  You are willing to totally screw over any non raiding tanks.  Again, I say no.  You chose utility over specialization when you chose to be a knight.  The one and only thing you give up is you cannot /disc defensive.  Now you say that for warriors to get fixed, you have to have that to.  No, no and again, no.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Besides is there anyone calling for knight agro on warriors? I closest I have seen is like agro--ie the same ballpark. <br />
<br />
Oh and you missed the knights being move upto the warrior damage tables and the nerf of 1h weapons (duel weild, was, orginally supposed to be the best damage set up).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>arbosch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">What you dont unterstand is that we have 2 different areas in this game. Raids and Exp groups. For raids noone need a paladin. Yes we can groupeheal. But take 1 cleric, shaman or druid and you have  better healer. We are nice to have in some situation but noone will give up a raid because there is no paladin there. If you dont have a warrior. How many killed elemental mainboss or time bosses without a warrior there? There is no question warriors are the king here.<br />
<br />
Exp groups where you gys whine. Knights are more liked because we can aggro. What you guys now want is that you can take aggro to. Tell me how you define that taunt work. There is not a better and a weaker taunt like in dps. It work or it dont work that easy. If warrios can taunt it is the same like the kingts. It dont give a better and a worser taunt. It work or it dont work. So no groupe will take a paladin because he can take aggro then. Now what situation we have now ?<br />
<br />
Warriors when they balance the wapons will allways have higher dps and tank better because they can us defensiv when something look bad and save critical situation and are ready again in 7 minutes. Paladins are weaker here. We have lay hands but the difference between the two things is that defensiv you can use instant. Lay hands you need to get the person in target and have to be near him. Usually you cant time it.Caster die to fast when he is aggro to help him with lay hands. So i is only good when you us it for yourself but again then it is mostly wasted because i trust the clerics i am with and if i am at 10% the ch is incoming. So when shall we us lay hands ? when we get below 10%. You die bevor you can use lay hands then. YOu ether trust your cleric that the ch is incoming or you us lay hands every 3. pull. Oh wait it after every 2. pull that the timer is back.  It sounds great on the paper as a instant saveresser but in the practise it rarly save your live when you tank. The best us for lay hands is on raids when you snag aggro and then us divine aura and us it then with licking da off and instant lay hands. But to us divine aura in a exp groupe is like this 'hello i am an retard. I now let the mob hit all the nice caster and healer arround me and stand there with me glorious da and when i used lay hands i join the fight again. Shit what stupid healers they die because i let the mob hit them.&quot; You will not find many exp groupe when you us DA as tank. We can groupehael yes. Tell me which exp group mobs has an ae dmg ? How many from us go hunt there ? Noone. If there is a mob which a an ae ALL exp groups go arround him to a better area. For exp groups our groupeheals are worthless because noone go hunt ae mobs in a exp group. For our normal heals we better try to take aggro then start healing because the mob make more dmg then we can heal and heals will not take the aggro from others. Ergo paladins will be in a even worser situation then warriors now and ergo i as paladin will have something back for that i get in this situation or ergo i find it not balanced.<br />

<br />
Things are not balanced now.  This is a given.  Most warriors know it, most knights know it, most everyone who has a clue knows it.  If we get something, and you get an increase too, things will still not be balanced between tank classes, and the game is unbalanced as well(knight agro + defensive = need to retune most raid encounters).<br />
<br />
And stop using the excuse that becuase 1 or 2 warriors has a well defined, high profile raid role, that warriors should be third class tanks.  By that argument, clerics should be the least desirable class for groups.  Raid balance and exp balance are two seperate topics.  Many many players simply do not raid, or raid rarely.  Why should they suffer for the ones who do?  Raid mobs are different from exp mobs, raid skills different from exp skills, the whole experience is different.  Leave the 2 as seperate issues, please.</div></div><hr />

It's garbarge, simply put. But, since you wanna come and bitch, let's go.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wapon balance. Everyone which say paladin have better wapons then warriors is an idiot. Everyone which say paladins dont get wapons easier as warriors is an idiot.<br />
<br />
Pre PoP paladins came near warriors dps because we got better wapons then warriors. PoP moved back to kunark and gave all the same wapions which was a big downfall in Paladins dps against warriors. High end paladin have a way lower dps then highend warriors. The situation is total fucked up now. Paladins get a lot of wapons easy and so the masses of paladins have better wapons then warriors. But for the highend paladins there is no real upgrade in there dps in PoP. To balance this verant need to put in a lot more warrior only wapons which are easy to get BUT has to upgrade the paladins highend wapons to. On that way the masses of warriors get wapons which are like goldenrod for paladins and can keep there dmg advantage against paladins and paladins can get a dps upgrade with PoP.&quot;<br />
<br />
Off the back, you are an idiot. . If you actually think that knight itemization sucks in PoP, let me show you something. The only warrior-only weapon in PoP thats worthy of discussing is Darkwind, which is still worse than a BoW. Granted, BoW's go to warriors primarily as they should, but viable replacements for the BoW do exist for knights. lemme run down a list:<br />
<br />
Resplendent War Maul<br />
Opalescent Two-Handed Sword<br />
Great Blade of Malise<br />
Coral Hilted Tulwar<br />
<br />
The above are all hybrid-only weapons from PoP. They don't include piercing weapons because Alla doesn't list them. We're not talking about one handers because their damage has officially gone to shit, thanks entirely to you hybrids by the way. Next question, if you can't answer that, tell me this, why is it that hybrids are supposed to deal equal melee damage to a warrior? You're on the same offensive tables, with only minimal difference in skill-caps. Considering the plethora of very good 2-handers for hybrids from SoL, and PoP, a hybrid with SEWS and no spells will still deal almost equal damage (90% or higher) to a warrior with BoW. Next..<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Taunting. Everyone which say warriors dont have a problem with taunt is an idiot. Everyone which say warrior should get aggro like knights and not give up something is an idiot.<br />
<br />
I agree that warriors need and upgrade how they taunt. BUT they need to give back the paladins/sk something. If warriors will taunt as good or near as good as the knights. Knights need to tank bossmobs near as good as warriors and this ONLY happen if knights get a defensiv discipline. Both sides win something with it and it will keep the balance. If you will keep it like it is now that warrior are the only possible tanks for bossmobs. Knights need to keep be the only real tank which can take aggro without problems. This is the balance between the tank classes. Warriors mainclass for raids without an real replacement. Knights for groups. And people which say 'but, but paladin can tank'. I answer with this 'but, but, warrior can taunt'. Dont mean it is effecitv and paladin tank bossmobs as good as warrior taunt.&quot;<br />
<br />
You DO have something else that we don't. They're called fucking spells. Since you seem to be such an expert on fucking planes of power, I find it ironic how you can fucking downgrade paladin heals in a goup in PoP considering how many mobs AoE there. Or downgrade BSS for that matter, or LoH. A non-tanking hybrid has a far more useful role on a raid than a non-tanking warrior, who deals only slightly more damage, and can watch as half the raid dies while waiting for him to re-gain agro if MT dies. As for hybrid tanking, mobs like Tallon Zek, both the regular version and the version in RZ encounter require excellent agro control but doesn't deal much DPS. many guilds opt for hybrid tanks on this mob..<br />
<br />
&quot;Hps. It is true that warrior dont have a big advantage over knights. But there are roques which has more hps then paladins. At the moment the situation is total fucked up. They need to downgroad all classes if they will balance it. To get paladins/sk less hps dont help because we have allready less hps then some non tank classes. This is a death end. To give warriors more hps is allso not an option because it will throw the balance out of window for the PvE encounter.&quot;<br />
<br />
This example can only be really illustrted via magelo, but since that's down, I'll hold off. Nevertheless, at the highest stage, with equal PoTime equippment, a warrior will have approximately 800 hp, maybe less, more than a knight. Whe you're talking about 9k vs. 8220 unbuffed, thats less than 10% differnce, even less when fully buffed. Your examples of &quot;well, there are rogues with more HP than hybrids&quot; are stupid at best. A PoTime/elemental equipped rogue will have more HP than an NToV equipped 65 warrior too.. What's your point? And exactly how does increasing warrior HP break PvE encounters.....<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Equipment. It has a lot to do with hps but was most warriors dont see is that paladins dont get the same upgrade from there equipment as warriors. As paladin i am not happy with our high end gear. For warrior it is easy. They need hps, resists, ac and melee improvments. Casters need hps, mana, resists, ac, wis or int and flowing thought and casting effects. Knights need all. If we get something without wis we lower our casting side. If we get something with focus effects and low ac we lower our tanking side. Warrior look at it if is a double win to get something to. This is wrong. Warriors get with every item and upgrade on all there mainstats. Knights dont get this. We dont get a 100% upgrade with every item on our stats. Lets take as example the Greaves of Furious Might. Warriors did cry to see that it is not warrior only and think it is godlike for paladins. Warrios get a 100% upgrade in all there mainstats. Paladins dont have a focus effect. So no upgrade to our casting side. Less mana so lower upgrade on our casting side. No flowing thought. No upgrade for our casting side. That is the same 100% upgrade for us like for warriors it need flowing thought V an effect which help our casting side and allso 210 mana. At the moment paladins allways need to make the decision if they will upgrade there casting or there melee side and lower the other side.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wow. Are you just pulling this shit randomly out of your ass or something? Check out some of your elemental equipment. If you notice, most of the slots have an effect as well as a focus effect. If you'll also notice, they have all of 10 hp less per slot than warrior equipment, but each item has at least 130 mana. Even your fucking charm is 90hp/80 mana vs. our 100hp/0 mana. That same paladin with 8200+ hp unbuffed mentioned above will still have a significant amount of focus effects, as well as  over 6k mana. But yes, I can clearly see how your high-end equipment is &quot;bad&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What you dont unterstand is that we have 2 different areas in this game. Raids and Exp groups. For raids noone need a paladin. Yes we can groupeheal. But take 1 cleric, shaman or druid and you have better healer. We are nice to have in some situation but noone will give up a raid because there is no paladin there. If you dont have a warrior. How many killed elemental mainboss or time bosses without a warrior there? There is no question warriors are the king here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cry me a fucking river. The only classes you technically &quot;need&quot; on a raid is a warrior, cleric, shaman, wiz, monk or sk and a rogue or 2 for drags. You don't NEED a lot of classes, but that doesn't diminish their effectiveness. BSS is very nice on a raid, and you can't argue otherwise, it's the highest HP buff of the line by far and paladin only. Paladin group heals are better those of druids. Shamans have quiescence yes, but they don't have any instant efficient GROUP heals. They'd have to chain quies onto every group member to keep up the heals, not easy to do exactly. Paladins also have the only instant CH  available (via AA yes, but still there). They have an EXTREMELY nice quick heal; 850hp, 1 second cast for when you need a fast heal. And, they still deal 90% of warrior DPS, and they can still add-tank without breaking mez far better than warriors. Yes, please contiue to whine about the fallacious supposed useless state of paladins on raids... Bitch.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Exp groups where you gys whine. Knights are more liked because we can aggro. What you guys now want is that you can take aggro to. Tell me how you define that taunt work. There is not a better and a weaker taunt like in dps. It work or it dont work that easy. If warrios can taunt it is the same like the kingts. It dont give a better and a worser taunt. It work or it dont work. So no groupe will take a paladin because he can take aggro then. Now what situation we have now ?&quot;<br />
<br />
English motherfucker, do you speak it? The above is not English.<br />
<br />
&quot;Warriors when they balance the wapons will allways have higher dps and tank better because they can us defensiv when something look bad and save critical situation and are ready again in 7 minutes. Paladins are weaker here. We have lay hands but the difference between the two things is that defensiv you can use instant. Lay hands you need to get the person in target and have to be near him.

Shit what stupid healers they die because i let the mob hit them.&quot; You will not find many exp groupe when you us DA as tank. We can groupehael yes. Tell me which exp group mobs has an ae dmg ? How many from us go hunt there ? Noone. If there is a mob which a an ae ALL exp groups go arround him to a better area. For exp groups our groupeheals are worthless because noone go hunt ae mobs in a exp group. For our normal heals we better try to take aggro then start healing because the mob make more dmg then we can heal and heals will not take the aggro from others. Ergo paladins will be in a even worser situation then warriors now and ergo i as paladin will have something back for that i get in this situation or ergo i find it not balanced.&quot;<br />

As Furor said it best, warriors are a one-trick pony with half a trick. Our /disc defensive is a band-aid fix for the last 3 years, a disc that 90% of the warrior community hates because it's Sony's excuse for not giving us separate mitigation tables. Our agro ability is extremely sub-par, and only redeemed when a warrior can get a BoW (maybe a BF/HG combo also), weapons 99% of warriors will never see. So, why don't you take your uninformed non-English speaking ass back to whatever community hasn't banned you yet, because your shit don't fly here boy.</div></div><hr />

If you haven't noticed arbosch, all of melee is hurting in a bad way.  Itemization was so screwed up in the low and mid-teir zones it just further hastened the crippling of melee.  No Warrior can expect ANY improvements off of exp monsters in Valor but casters can?  How is that balanced?<br />
<br />
Melee is so inherently dangerous in POP that putting any players in melee range of a monster a lot of risk.  I've given up on any meaningful improvements to my melee performance.  Seriously...why add more melee DPS, melee which has to stumble and chase monsters, when casters can run circles around it?  (Then there are Rangers but I'm torn about that which is another post anyway ^_^).  The point is, itemization for Paladin weapons isn't bad considering what other classes got.  If you thought high end weapondry was going to turn Paladin DPS into something noticable, you are sadly mistaken.<br />
<br />
Taunt I believe is a symptom of general weakness in Pure Melee in POP (Warriors simply don't have enough things in melee to do to monsters).  It should be solved inside of the class.  It has little to do with any other classes beyond balancing the costs.  Where is the justification for making Warriors give up something?  There is none becuse their other skills aren't what is broken.  Why should other classes get something in return?  There is no reason because it has little to do with them.  Why do people keeping thinking like this?  Beats me but it is wrong.  I wish players would stop posting this ad hoc idea.<br />
<br />
The proliferation of HP ALL/ALL items really did hurt the game.  The saving grace now is that AC means something again.  Thank goddess the gap between Plate AC and non-Plate is quite wide again and offers truly meaningful mitigation.  HP is important but now so is AC.<br />
<br />
Even with that said, the gap between Warriors and Knights isn't wide.  But then again I'm not sure if that is much of a problem if the situation was balanced.  When all things are equal you bring a tank into a group you bring tanking and there skills.</div></div><hr />

Any class that knows his roll brings more to the group then 15 ubah ornate twink equipped pukes.<br />
<br />
Well I almost always tank.  I like guild groups, and we have few knights but buttloads of warriors.  Anyhow:<br />
<br />
SK = Awesome snare aggro leap, snare, taunt, save chanter. (as well as all that other cool stuff he can do, FD, VoT, grp taps)<br />
RNG = Awesome snare aggro leap, snare taunt, save chanter. (as well as all that other cool stuff he can do, ie AM3 and ghetto mez)<br />
SHM/ENC = omg fot7 and VQ make me drool.<br />
CLR = da big bomb heal and virt, what more could a growing meat shield want<br />
DRU = dps/backuphealer/&quot;omg get us out of here&quot;<br />
MNK/ROG = not a day goes by that my normal SHM/CLR/RNG groups says &quot;hmmm lets grab a rogue or monk to fill out the dps, we got a ranger to ghetto mez and am3 already&quot;  what can I say to a double 250 bs with awesome duelwield and evade, or a 320 kick (yes I said kick warriors, that thing we crit for 17 on), with FD pull and stone stance offtanking ability<br />
BRD = sing that funky haste baby sing it (skilled bards can just about do it all)<br />
WIZ/MAG = BOOOOOOM! yeah, thats how you dps that stuff (or make me arrows, whooo hooo ARROWS!)<br />
BST = buffs, pet, incslow (to save chanter....if I can find any other class but a chanter to taunt off of, and still allow chanter slow on inc, I am soo doing it)<br />
NEC = what is he doing grouping?  (seriously dps with pop length exp battles, his dot's are doing their job, he can replace any dps class)<br />
PAL = grp heal, backup tank, chanter saver, loh on the chanter, stun to save cleric mana, root, masacre undead<br />
WAR = I get barshed well! OH CRAP AET /disc defensive mwuhahaha he only hit me for 960<br />
<br />
Anyhow everyone has a role, and a purpose in an exp group.  I agree that the WAR vs Knight decision is in the favor of the Knight in exp groups, the gods know I have been in exp groups that asked &quot;should we get a pally to tank?&quot;  Pally dont need nerfing, I like BSS, I am an hp fiend.  However War need some form of revamping, maybe shield with 2hander I dont know.  I just do my tank job, I dont have all the answers.  War aggro is a problem, but with a bit of thinking we can work around it for now.  chanter visage, VoT, snare aggro leap, whatever.  The War aggro problem is a huge issue, and yes we need some tweeking, but lets not lash out too bad, I have spent the last several months intensly practicing with my knights, rangers, beastlords, shaman, etc..... that I group with, to create solutions to my aggro problem, at least untill the gods that be fix my ability to allow the other classes to do their job (me no have aggro, noone can dotheir job).<br />
<br />
Ok that was my hope that we did not expand our rant to start needlessly bashing other classes, lets consentrate on warrior strategy, not giving Absor or Abashi or whoever an excuse to go hog wild with the nerf stick.<br />

I chose a plate-class to fight...  not run like a robe...<br />
<br />
knights have the SAME itemization issues in PoP as warriors...  we have 2 options for 2H, and one of them might as well be warrior-only. SEWS and BoW...  everything else out of PoP is not really an upgrade.  I can sympathize with warriors as I have the same problem...<br />
<br />
Knights who are realistic do not need nor want /disc defensive...  Knights should be transition tanks in raids...  to this end we could use SOMETHING for short-duration raid tanking...  every other melee class can stand those 2000+ hitters in time for a few seconds by hitting a discipline...  knights, who are supposed to be tied for the second best tanks in the game cannot even hope to stand for the 9-20 seconds of glory every other melee class gets...  how about something with a shield? Auto-block for a short period with shield? (hell give it to warriors too... its not like the mobs don't hit hard enough....)<br />
<br />
Warriors have issues with hate generation in the pre-BoW era.<br />
most reasonable knights agree.  Raise the warriors ability to add hate when they NEED it.  This should be separate from the TAUNT button...  (+hate to kick??)<br />
<br />
Make shields useful for warriors and knights please... warriors should be absolutely the best with them....  even allowing certain WAR-only shields to add to mainhand DB would be very cool.<br />
<br />
<br />
most of the issues knights have with warriors is when they spout bullshit about knights and have no proof, no backing, and no information except their &quot;grass is greener&quot; attitude.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>arbosch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Well berhaps it is me bad english because you dont unterstand me. In easy words this is what i think will balance warriors and knights.<br />
<br />
1.) Put in a lot more warrior only wapons which have the dmg/delay of paladin 2hs and are as easy to get like the knight one with good aggro procs. This will solve 2 things. First it will upgrade warriors dps over knights because knights has lower skills. A lot of the 90% dps bullshit come from parsing good knight wapons against bad warrior wapons which is the norm now. Paladins have better wapons. With this we will be back to 80 to 85% of the dps from warriors which i think we all can live with. This will be an upgrade only for warriors and knights get nothing.<br />
<br />
2.) Upgrade all  PoP Highend melee wapons that both all melee classes get an dps upgrade against casters. This will be an upgrade from melees against casters. This will be no upgrade for one of both classes against the other one and keep the balance in.<br />
<br />
3.) Upgrade the PoP equipment that it fit more our roles. Warriors should have more hps then Knights but knights should have more hps then light tanks or casters. At the moment warriors has a to low hps different against knights but it is even worser when you look between knights and light tanks and casters. The hps difference is less then between knights and warriors. I see this will not happen because the only way they can do this is to give warriors 1500 more hps and knights 800 hps. This will make the difference between full buffed knights and warriors between 1000 to 2000hps which should be enough. But this will screw PvE raids because it is a big difference to have an 9,5k tank or an 11k tank. So i dont see this happen.<br />
<br />
4.) This is what we dont agree with each other. You want another tool to generate aggro which give you a tool to taunt well. Like i said there is not a better and a weaker taunt. It work and you get agro or it dont work and you dont get aggro. If you will get this upgrade you have to give something  up to balance knights and warriors because you will allready get an upgrade against knights with that they put in more warrior only wapons which help you to taunt better to when they have good procs. If you get this tool, paladins need to get an tool to let them tank bossmobs nearly as effectiv as warriors. Only a defensiv discipline can do that. At the moment we have the situation paladins cant tank mainmobs effectiv and warriors cant taunt effectiv. If warrios can taunt effectiv why shoudlnt paladins not be able to tank mainmobs effectiv ?<br />
<br />
Arbosch Bloodforge<br />
<br />
***<br />
btw. a little a mathematic lesson :).<br />
<br />
Lets take warrior and say they only need one stat hps and this stat give them an upgrade. Lets take a paladin which need 2 stats hps and mana. Hps give him a 75% upgrade and mana give him a 25% upgrade to his skill and 100 is the max you can get (i take this numbers to explain it on an easy way). <br />
<br />
Now the warrior get an item which give him 100hps. This 100hps give him a 100% upgrade. <br />
<br />
Now take a paladin which get an item which gve him 100hps and 50mana. Effectiv he got 50mana more then the warrior. But if you look at the upgrade he got. He get 100% upgrade from the hps. But this is only 75% worth because he need to upgrade his caster side to to get an 100% upgrade. Now his cleric side dont got a full upgrade which is possible. So he got only 12 1/2 % upgrade on cleric side. On that way he only got an effectiv upgrade from 87 1/2 % from his power against the 100% from the warrior. You can explain but 50mana is 50 mana more effectiv. But you have to unterstand that the paladin need this 50mana to support his caster side and if he dont get the same 100% upgrade there he get effectiv a lesser upgrade on that slot then the warrior. Only if you get the best possible upgrade on all stats you need you get an 100% upgrade.  As more stats you miss as less effectiv is this upgrade. Or another example to make it easier. If we take your calculation that 100hps on paladin are as good as 100hps on knights. If the knights upgarde all slots with an item which get him 100hps and 0 mana and the warrior to. Both should have the same upgrade on his power with this. How good is the knight then effectiv when he dont have mana to cast his spells ? I am sure we all agree that this knight will have got a lesser upgrade then the warrior overall. Or in other word. The balance on items is total screwed because warriors dont get the needed hps advantage over other classes and for hyps because we have rarly an item which really upgrade all our needed stats and have to make the decision between our melee and caster side.<br />

then give up your spell book.<br />
<br />
<br />
Warriors SHOULD aggro as good as knights, EVEN better.<br />
We should also TANK a hell lot better then you.<br />
It's that simple.<br />
<br />
You paladins have a huge advantage with aggro, and thats a mistake, it should have never happened.<br />
<br />
Either you want spells,<br />
or you want to tank.<br />
<br />
ATM, as a knight, you get both, and that's MESSED UP.<br />
<br />
<br />
And you want Defensive as a Knight?<br />
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHASHAHAHAHAHA<br />
<br />
you are hilarious! seriously.... THINK... sit back and THINK two seconds... at least.. try to...<br />
<br />
Defensive is the ONLY thing making warriors usefull atm...<br />
if Knights got efensive.. WHEN, WHY, HOW would a Warrior be of any use????<br />
<br />
Grouping?.. get the knight, best tank for groups...<br />
Raiding?.. get the knight, best aggro, and he can heal himself, and he got LoH.<br />
<br />
Warriors will be deleted, period....<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm seriously getting pissed with these ASSES, that think having a spell book isn't important....<br />
<br />
Warriors can ONLY Kick and Disarm and Taunt...<br />
Knights can Kick, Disarm, Taunt AND do 100 more things thanks to spells..<br />
<br />
and you still want more?<br />
<br />
FUCK YOU!<br />
<br />
((there, sorry, I flamed in a non Outhouse thread, but fuck it. I dont think you can talk about warriors anymore without flames.<br />
We're so badly fucked, some people still think it's not true...<br />
and some people are still retarded enough to want something for knights, in exchange of a warrior fix.. so i'm going to say it again, and I apologise in advance))<br />
<br />
FUCK YOU!</div></div><hr />

btw. a little a mathematic lesson :).<br />
<br />
Lets take warrior and say they only need one stat hps and this stat give them an upgrade. Lets take a paladin which need 2 stats hps and mana. Hps give him a 75% upgrade and mana give him a 25% upgrade to his skill and 100 is the max you can get (i take this numbers to explain it on an easy way). <br />
<br />
Now the warrior get an item which give him 100hps. This 100hps give him a 100% upgrade. <br />
<br />
Now take a paladin which get an item which gve him 100hps and 50mana. Effectiv he got 50mana more then the warrior. But if you look at the upgrade he got. He get 100% upgrade from the hps. But this is only 75% worth because he need to upgrade his caster side to to get an 100% upgrade. Now his cleric side dont got a full upgrade which is possible. So he got only 12 1/2 % upgrade on cleric side. On that way he only got an effectiv upgrade from 87 1/2 % from his power against the 100% from the warrior. You can explain but 50mana is 50 mana more effectiv. But you have to unterstand that the paladin need this 50mana to support his caster side and if he dont get the same 100% upgrade there he get effectiv a lesser upgrade on that slot then the warrior. Only if you get the best possible upgrade on all stats you need you get an 100% upgrade.  As more stats you miss as less effectiv is this upgrade. Or another example to make it easier. If we take your calculation that 100hps on paladin are as good as 100hps on knights. If the knights upgarde all slots with an item which get him 100hps and 0 mana and the warrior to. Both should have the same upgrade on his power with this. How good is the knight then effectiv when he dont have mana to cast his spells ? I am sure we all agree that this knight will have got a lesser upgrade then the warrior overall. Or in other word. The balance on items is total screwed because warriors dont get the needed hps advantage over other classes and for hyps because we have rarly an item which really upgrade all our needed stats and have to make the decision between our melee and caster side. <br />
<br />
Here Arbosch illustrates for us a pretty common fallacy, which is that having multiple axes of power means you are weaker unless all are improved at the same rate at the same time. <br />
<br />
Basically, he's beefing that 100 hps on paladins is not the same as 100hps on warriors. Why? Because it's not improving his spells at the same time.<br />
<br />
But this is nonsense. Isn't it clear that 100 hps is 100 hps? The only sense in which warriors might benefit more from that (because warriors are 100% melee) is due to the fact that warriors START OUT WITH A SMALLER BASE OF POWER (not having spells). The fact that you have ADDITIONAL sources of power amounts to a bonus when they are improved too. In fact, that 100 hps improves paladins MORE than warriors on a relative basis, since it shrinks the proportional advantage warriors had before gear was even a factor. <br />
<br />
Moreover, Arbosch's OWN example of the Greaves of Furious Might shows that with current itemization trends, paladins do not have to make compromises in gear selection. They get the 100hps AND they get the 100 mana.<br />
<br />
Among Arbosch's problems is the fact that he's sliding around between different scales -- namely the 100% balance between warrior and paladin, and the internal proportion within paladins of melee/caster abilites. Those don't mix the way he seems to think they do. Basically, his math is completely bogus.</div></div><hr />

Absolutley.  The whole gear situation now is totally out of whack.  There have been a number of solutions suggested as to how to fix it.<br />
<br />
4.) This is what we dont agree with each other. You want another tool to generate aggro...If you get this tool, paladins need to get an tool to let them tank bossmobs nearly as effectiv as warriors.  <br />
<br />
Huh?  Why do paladins need to be able to tank boss mobs?

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>arbosch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">No it is not bogus. I token the 100hps to let it calculate easier. If it will have been a 100% upgrade the legs should have 210 mana to and a casting effect or flowing thought. Then it will have been a full upgrade on our caster side to because it is the max worth we can get. <br />
<br />
Lets explain it in another way. If there drop legs which have the same stats but have low ac 175hps and 210 mana with flowing thought VI and casting effect. Now with your logic this legs have to be less worth then the 210 hps one because they have less hps. If a paladin take this legs he got a worser upgrade then the warrior with his 210hps?<br />
<br />
With your logic it dont care which legs he take and if you take both paladins both will be equal strong. You think the paladin with the 175hps low ac will tank as good as the one with the 210 hps/high ac one? You think the paladin with the 175mana/no casting effect will keep healing aslong as the one with the casting effects and flowing thought? This is only one item take this up to x slots and you see a high difference between the stats. Tell me how the balance is against true melees then from a paladin which upgrade all his slots with high mana / low hps items and a paladin which upgrade all his slots with high hps / low mana items?<br />
<br />
You say the paladin can get for every slot 2 items. A high mana/low hps one and a high hps/low mana one. Yes but cant wear both at the same time. So one side is allways weaker then the other.<br />

You remember clerics and other healer situation. It is the same with defensiv now. The knights defensiv has to be balanced. It has to be weaker like complet heal from druid/shaman is weaker then the one from clerics. Warriors will allways and shall allways be the king of tanking. But aslong they have defensiv and paladins dont have any form of defensiv there is a high unbalance between this two classes for taking. Aslong you dont agree with this unbalance and take this out of every calculation for balance you cant end with something which balance both classes. Agree that you are a way better tank then knights only because this discipline. Aslong you say we are asgood tanks then warriors even without this discipline you cant end with something which is balanced.<br />

<br />
Guess what? Warriors have no spells, and casters can't tank. Why do you imagine paladins should be able to do both without compromising anything?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">About the only good thing in this thread is that a lot of myths are getting exposed.<br />
<br />
I really hate the myth of the &quot;Warrior + Cleric&quot; thing.  It makes people think that Paladins are hobbled because of a mythical AA penalty and other such nonsense.  Paladins may have problems but it certainly isn't because of the dualistic nature.<br />
<br />
One of the points of being a Hybrid is findig the balance between HP and Mana.  I would gladly sac 100 HP for another FT point.  Just because a piece of gear only has HP +100 on it doesn't mean a Paladin get shafted but a Warrior gets some bonus.  Its goofy logic that makes problems appear where there are none.<br />
<br />
To repeat: there is nothing wrong with gear favoring one class over other.  Gear that has only +HP isn't as attractive to Paladins.  There is nothing wrong with this.  Varity is the spice of life (or the game).  Idealistically, each class should desire something different as &quot;the perfect item&quot; anyway.<br />
<br />
As for melee performance, sure changing around weapons may help but the environment is so hostile to melee.  Monsters are geared to punish anyone in melee range.  Serious raid monsters can easily Reposte big damage back so the only place you can stick melee is behind the monster.  Placing 30 melee behind a monster in close quarters is often times a mess.  I'm also ignoring the fights were it is clear you want to fight from range.  It doesn't matter if you manage to snag an &quot;improved&quot; Hopebringer if you are forced to fight the monster from 300 units away.<br />
<br />
As for defensive, Warriors can keep it.  Its an ugly albatross hanging around their neck that IMHO has killed the growth of the class.  I don't want Defensive.  I'm stumped why arbosch thinks any other class needs it.  I wonder if arbosch thinks the only thing he can do during a raid is melee?  If he does then he is sadly under utilitizing himself during the raid.  I've got plenty to do during a raid where most of the time it has nothing to do with tanking.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Gyrfalcon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">OK, Paladins and SKs were initially designed to be 75 percent warrior and 25 percent caster, but somewhere along the way they have become 90 percent warrior and 50 percent caster, and in the process, had many of the downsides of their class selection removed (ie, xp penalty). Now in true RPG fashion, if this game adhered to RPG rules, Paladins at least had to fulfill a certain goody-two-shoes code in order to maintain their status as a paladin (ie, pray to their gods, do good deeds, never attackj their opponent from behind, etc.). Otherwise, he or she loses that wonderful spell book and abilities, and is left with just a sword, shield and armor. Kinda like a military officer losing their commission for conduct unbecoming. This wouldn't necessarily work with SKs, as every one I've met is evil as hell anyway.<br />
<br />
Now Aborsch, you want to have your cake and eat it too? You want to keep your spellbook, LoH and have /disc defensive as well? Or you want a watered down version of defensive? You got one, /disc evasive, but maybe you don't use it because it isn't as awesome as defensive. Well, hate to break it to you, defensive isn't that awesome. It works once every seven minutes, so using it in a group environment is limited at best, and it really only shines in a raid environment. But then, you only really need one warrior on a raid. What can all the other warriors who come along offer? Oh, let me bind wounds for you...<br />
<br />
Warriors can't solo. We need a group. Once a warrior reaches a certain level, taking on dark blue con mobs becomes impossible to solo save for the most hyper twinked select few. Hell, light blue mobs can wipe us, and when we are on a CR, unless we were lucky enough to keep a SoW potion in the bank, we have no way of avoiding agro from these mobs. It's not like we can root them. But most of us knew this when we made our warriors.\<br />
<br />
Thing is, when you made your paladin, you knew you would never be able to tank as good as a warrior. But game dynamics havbe made it so that you are tanking as good as a warrior, and with you snap-lock agro, you are tanking better than a warrior. Tell me, what good is it to have all the AC, HP and damage avoidance in the world, if the mob ignores you and goes after the cleric who heals you or the shaman who slows the mob? Why should a wizard have to hold back on the amount of damage he can do when it pulls the mob off the warrior and attacks the wizard? Because pulling agro off the tank often could mean the death of a group member, or at the least an inefficient waste of mana on heals. But what if you had a tank who never, or rarely at least, lost agro? Oh boy, casters are now able to cast to their heart's content without fear of diverting the mob! This is why warriors are finding it hard to get a group now. Paladins and SKs are preferred because casters are tired of  being held back by the warrior's gimped agro management (succinctly put KICK, DISARM, TAUNT) that is no different in essence from the day that warrior was started. Oh, the skills have improved, but it is still pathetic.<br />
<br />
Let me give you a detailed look at warrior agro management, arborsch.<br />
<br />
TAUNT puts the warrior at the top of the hate list plus an X amount of hate (not that much since it is easy to pull agro back even on a successful taunt). Yes, the warrior taunt skill maxes out higher. In practice, though, I have only had a success rate of about 2 out of every 3 times. A third of the time, it doesn't work, and I have to wait SIX SECONDS to try again, or if it does work, then the caster I am taunting the mob off of does something (like sitting down) that pulls the mob back to it, and I still have to wait six more seconds to try and taunt again. To make matters worse, the only success or fail message I get when I use this skill is if the mob is hitting me or not.<br />
<br />
DISARM is so pathetic, I woun't even go here. It only seems to work if the mob actually has a weapon, and if it does generate any hate, it is very miniscule. But any amount of hate generation is better than none, so I mash this button anyway, just like I mash the taunt button sometimes trying to generate that X amount of hate.<br />
<br />
KICK/BASH/SLAM Of these three, kick is the most widely used over level 55 because a) it generates more damage than slam and b) has a stun effect that does interrupt spell casting. I have yet to see a kick turn agro for me though, stun or no stun. Bash only works if the warrior holds a shield, and slam is only used by large race warriors. All three of these are tied to the same timer.<br />
<br />
JUST SO YOU KNOW, ARBOSCH: All of these agro management tools available to the warrior are also available to Paladins and SKs. Try tanking one of those planar mobs without spells next time, using the tools us warriors have, and see how well you can hold agro, and also see how many comments you get from group members about why you aren't using stun spells. I know because I play a human warrior and am often mistaken for a paladin, and have gotten rude tells chewing me out for not casting stuns to manage agro (uh, hello, WAR not PAL).<br />
<br />
So as a warrior, if I want to generate hate, I am limited to these other tools at hand. I can get weapons with procs, and hope I get a decent amount of procs that I will hold agro. Just so you know, arbosch, SOE put EB weapons in as an itemization bandaid to try and fix warrior agro management. The only droppable EB weapon sells for over 350Kpp on my server. Not many warriors have this kind of money ( I know I don't), or if they do, they certainly didn't earn it playing a warrior.<br />
<br />
I think most everyone here who plays a warrior would agree that all the warrior needs is a reliable method of hate generation that does not rely on procs (read fickle RNG), spending AA points or an itemization bandaid that less than 2 percent of the warriors in the game would even have a chance at getting.<br />
<br />
Oh well, I have cast my pearl before the swine...</div></div><hr />

Warriors have issues as well.  most of them are shared by knights, only warriors will never listen to that.  The only one that is not shared is hatred generation.  Knight spells make hate very well...  note its taken HOW many expansions for that to actually become a noticeable advantage?<br />

Knight spellbooks come with disadvantages...  most of which warriors will never listen to as they have no concept.  Apparently, most warriors cannot understand the concept that when being hit hard, you do not cast well.<br />

Fix warrior's taunt for pre-BoW?  yes please...<br />
but fix Knight raid roles as well...<br />
<br />
Who is hurt if knights and warriors can use the shield to mitigate more?  no one... (but only if shields are made viable for warriors.. trading damage for tanking is fine...  gimping warrior taunt is NOT helpful.)<br />
<br />
Who is hurt if knights can actually Auto-block for 15 seconds? (heck give to warriors too...)  Knights become transition tanks... God forbid...<br />
<br />
Who is hurt if warriors become better taunters without a BoW? knights DO lose some group leverage... but most agree its a welcome change.<br />
<br />
<br />
Knights have no right asking for improvements? spoiled?  <br />
<br />
Thats just precious...  knights have been in warriors' shadow for so long that warriors would have to have /disc defensive taken away and two or more years without improvements to even START to understand knights' position.<br />
<br />
let us not have another three expansions where hybrids might as well twink a warrior. (there is a reason most elder knights are well aware of warrior issues... we got tired of being pointless and rolled warriors...)<br />
<br />
I welcome any warrior who would try it to start a knight and see him to raiding level.  At least you might begin to understand knight issues and why they are so closely linked with warrior issues.<br />
<br />
I wish the poster of this fiasco was the only one who was so far out in left field...<br />

He tanks just fine in HoH, BoT, PoV, CoD, etc etc.  I have little to no trouble casting spells while those 'hard hitting mobs' are wailin away on me.

Is that about the stupidest fucking thing you have ever heard or what?  If your spellbook is such a disadvantage, throw it out.  Oh wait, you depend on those spells.  Because of those spells, knight are preferred exp tanks.  Wow, there is a big disadvantage.<br />
<br />
The funny part is he is going to say 'See, you have no concept' and go on about how long he has played the game, and how he is in Time, and how smart he is and dumb I am.  But I am not so dumb as to make such an outrageous statement.  The only possible disadvantage is that you have to worry about mana as well as your melee stats, but with itemization as it is, that is a minor concern.</div></div><hr />

I know thats real tough and all on ya, but if someone who's played a warrior as long as you've played a SK can figure it out and all...

<br />
I mean how hard is it to some up with factual stuff? take a look at the threads in PoN do a search in the general forum for what can knights tank? Read the replys that KNIGHTS made to that thread started by a knight. Then tell me why disc defensive is so great that warriors should be gimped in other areas cause they got that? and please no delusions of grandeur or talking out your ass cause believe it or not most here (not sure about ninja :p ) can see right through the crap you spew.<br />

I am by no means saying the stuff I post in regards to the balance disparity is the right thing or the best thing but at least I use facts instead of making shit up to make my position look stronger. <br />

The best way to deal with it is to have a firm administration team not afraid to use their powers.  Let the banter go back and forth for a bit because, if nothing else, others who wander by need to read why flaming trolls are wrong.  But if it gets out of hand or gets repeative then the admins should start squashing and banning.  It work great for some one who shall remain nameless. ^_^</div></div><hr />

<br />
well, maybe i am just uninformed, but since the goal of the knight seems to be tanking... it seems to me, that IF you are being hit and cant cast a spell...well, you are TANKING and NOT losing aggro, therfore you dont need to cast a spell at this exact moment do you?  why would you need to cast an aggro spell when you already have aggro? and if your tanking, I bet there is someone else healing you, so you dont need to do that right this second either do you?<br />
<br />
as for having to stop your melee dmg while casting, well if you lose aggro and need to cast a stun spell to get aggro back..Warriors would GLADLY give up 2 seconds of melee DPS to regain aggro so completely. heck I would love it.<br />
<br />
fact is i dont think pally's get it.  when you are tanking, your not their for your DPS. your there for the ability to aggro and that is IT.  the whines about their DPS is utter bullshit IMO.  you have an aggro lock, you dont need to do massive dmg on top of that.  just hold the damn mob!  and if your not that tank, you have other utilities to use which greatly benefit the group. you dont need to do massive amounts of damage!<br />
<br />
warriors have 1 role. to tank. that is it, thats what they were made to do.  if we are not the tank, then we are a wasted group slot as there are 12 other classes which do more dmg than us and bring other abilities to the group at the same time.  knights can whine all about how war DPS is higher, personally, i dont see it, i dont agree with it, i think knight dps is the same as mine, or damn close to it as to be negligable but ok, ill let you have it, we have a slightly higher DPS...but we contribute NOTHING besides that 5% more dmg or our tanking ability. and IF we are not that the MT...its just that 5% dmg.. so cry me a fucking river about how bad knights have it and noone seems to notice.\<br />
<br />
knights were supposed to give up something for their abilities and spells.  HELLO!!! give up!! as in, do without...you have LOTS of other things you bring to the table that we dont have...that was the trade you made.  lately you have had to give up less and less and you were made more powerful.. now you want it all? I for 1 am hoping knights get nerfed to hell, not because i nessacarily think they should be but because I want to see all your faces when you realize exactly how good you have had it while you continue to bitch and moan about wanting more and more.</div></div><hr />

When you pick a Warrior, it's to be the BEST tank class. You are suppose to be a SPECIALISED class.<br />
<br />
When you pick a paladin, it's to be able to tank, but be able to have fun with spells as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
Warriors atm are NOT the best tank! They are the worse, except when using /disc defensive......<br />
<br />
Paladins can tank almost anything, and they got tasty spells.<br />
<br />
To be brief,<br />
Paladins get what the class is designed for,<br />
Warriors don't.<br />
<br />
<br />
And how the hell can you say Knights have issues?<br />
You are obviously crap at playing the class.<br />
You can not only solo a whole zone (Veksar), but you bring 0 stress to a group, as well as faster DPS from the whole group.<br />
You also offtank best in raids, Warriors SUCK at offtanking.<br />
You also group heal great for AoEs....</div></div><hr />

Yeah, while I do see that knights have a couple problems that need to be addressed, they are nowhere near as bad as Brik tries to make them seem.  He's either A: Pulling things out of his ass  B: Not really as uber or high level as he claims or C: Really sucks as a SK<br />
<br />
SK's and Paladins do have some problems right now, but so do all melee classes in general right now.  Warriors are by FAR in a worse position than knights.  Most of the problems Brik claims for SK's are either non-existant, or exagerated</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u98"><b>Mathas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p98">Originally posted by Bunnie Burner <br />

For what it's worth, I think most shadowknights(which is what Brik is, by the way) would be extremely hard-pressed to solo everything in Veksar.  There are quite a few mobs there that I wouldn't want to touch solo, and my gear's probably a bit nicer than the average SK.<br />

Hehe... that sort of reply reminds me of my discussion with a bard...<br />
I told him they bascially get everything.. the reply was<br />
&quot;No we don't, we don't have ports&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
I may have exagerated a bit by saying the WHOLE zone...<br />
but I thought it was irrelevant that Garudon and a few other mobs weren't soloable.<br />
And ya, it's a bit tougher for a SK to solo there.<br />
<br />
None the less... you helped me prove my point by saying &quot;there's quite a few that I wouldn't touch solo&quot;....<br />
You can solo... and MOST of a zone.<br />
Farm nameds, get exp, survive, have fun wtfever.....<br />
you can do it alone.<br />
Warriors can't.</div></div><hr />

Well, I have a tendancy to understate things... &quot;quite a few&quot; being one of the understaments in that post.<br />
<br />
But yeah, shadowknights can solo, it's just not anywhere near the majority of that zone.  Even with malos(I duo with a shaman often) I was having trouble consistantly landing any of my poison/disease spells, which pretty much limited me to snare and lifetaps on a reliable basis.  That's not exactly conductive to soloing a zone full of summoning mobs, especially the 300+ hitters or the tougher nameds :p<br />

PoN hasn't banned anyone for being a warrior. People get banned for being disruptive dillrods. There are several warriors who are frequent posters on this board that also happen to be long time members of PoN as well. They just happen to not be disruptive dillrods.</div></div><hr />

I've been posting on PoN for well over a year.  And frequently the debate does get hot and heavy.  I have yet to be banned for expressing my opinion, and I don't always wear the kid gloves.  So I'd agree with Graal, you only get banned from PoN if you're being a disruptive dillrod.</div></div><hr />

tho i am not a dillrod i do like to shake things up, cause debates and the like, i couldnt be a actor so i have to inspire emotions in people by pissing them off or making them laugh and think. anyhow excuse my crassness it was because i was drunk, tried labat blue for the first time had a lil to much, didnt pay attention to the booze by volume :P</div></div><hr />
