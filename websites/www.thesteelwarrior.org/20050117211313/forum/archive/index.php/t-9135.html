<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Athrias</div><div class="date">09-26-2004, 07:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not so much now that you can un-aug and resell them. Obviously Anger 3 would be better, but even with WA5 it's only 300 hate/minute better. Throwing A3 in there eventually is of course a good idea, but it's nothing that you need to be shaking in your boots about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neksnappa</div><div class="date">09-27-2004, 08:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been tanking with A2 in offhand for a while now, and don't really have the desire to grind out more point to upgrade to a3. I very very rarely have aggro issues, and those only happen when someone else goes totally overboard dps/aggro, or if the RNG shats on me and I get no procs for 20-30 seconds. <br />
<br />
On the other hand, I would rather have a yak aug in offhand than the anger2. Same aggro, but more dps, and there's also that whole discussion that stun aggro might be much higher depending on the level range of your target.<br />
<br />
Still, A2 is decent for aggro, and as mentioned, upgrade to A3 will net you like 300 aggro per minute more. If you've got the points, or can get them easily, go for it. If not, no worries.</div></div><hr />

If you MT a lot of raids for pickups and/or your guild then you might want to jump for an anger3 ... but imo it isnt even close to &quot;necessary&quot;.</div></div><hr />
