Any reason to stick to a small number of pullers?  Seeing what we can do to speed things up...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kilzalot</div><div class="date">02-16-2005, 07:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Keep your melee in camp doing DPS and have your pullers only out pulling.  A good Bard should be able to keep your camp pretty full of mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cloudwalker21</div><div class="date">02-16-2005, 09:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Though it is a lot harder for melee dps to be very effective, due to the 3 dimensions you have to worry about fighting in. We've always kept them bunched around the casters, since its a safe bet they can hit f8 and at least start firing arrows at them. They're weak enough that melee dps isnt a swing factor, its being able to kill them rapidly. Too bad I didnt have an earthshaker last time for Coirnav and his 25 guards :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bardeil</div><div class="date">02-16-2005, 09:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We've found the only way to ensure enough mobs in camp to AE them is to have a bunch of pullers. The 25 guards spawn all over the place, I am pretty skeptical one toon could pull them all effectively.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">02-16-2005, 10:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Though it is a lot harder for melee dps to be very effective,due to the 3 dimensions you have to worry about fighting in. <br />
<br />
That's partly why I asked about just having a bunch of meleers help pull.  My impression when we tried Coirnav last night was that we meleers were contributing very little dps.  It was so hard to find your target.  F8... hmm... nope, i'm not on it.  Ah!  There it is!  Oops, it's dead.  Well, at least I got to hit it a couple times.  Next.  Midway through it I saw one monk type, &quot;I finally hit one!&quot;  heh... I don't know what he was doing.  It wasn't THAT hard to hit some, but we sure weren't doing much dps.  <br />
<br />
And yes, the mobs are really spread out when they spawn.  One bard isn't going to just drag the whole wave back to camp.  That and the bard we had out there got splatted all over a tunnel when he moved a named out of the way.  Ouch.  <br />
<br />
Anyone just bring the named in with your wave killing and take them out as you go?  Or is that simply impractical?  Just tossing ideas around... we'll probably get it done without needing to try that...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bardeil</div><div class="date">02-16-2005, 10:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You'll most likely do better just offrooting / offtanking the named.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can anyone elaborate a little on 'pulling the named out of the way'?<br />
<br />
I thought they didn't spawn until the script began, is it quicker to pull them away and park them or does it just make the tanking easier?  Or are they removable before the event even starts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cuclain MacLlir</div><div class="date">02-16-2005, 07:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The named spawn with the waves.  We always had teams assigned to root them away from where we were AEing, with varying degrees of success. <br />
<br />
We had our regular pullers pull the 1st wave, then added warriors to help pull the rest. As mentioned above, the wave mobs are spread out and they also seemed to have a small aggro radius, so the more pullers the better was our plan.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">02-17-2005, 08:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As Cuclain did, we drag the named elsewhere so they're not in the way of our AE slaughter.  And yes, we do it with varying degrees of success.  I guess they corpse camp though.  So if our named puller(s) die during their task, it can still be okay.  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">03-04-2005, 12:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another Coirnav question... when the waves are down and the minis are down, you've got coirnav left with 25 more trash mobs around him.  It's charge coirnav time as the clock ticks down.  Is there anything particular your guilds did to get enough dps in on coirnav before the adds killed you?  Our last couple attempts have failed at this point.  The adds rip us up and we can't get Coirnav dropped.  This last time we didn't run out of time.  We wiped hard to all those adds and Coirnav.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jearom</div><div class="date">03-04-2005, 12:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can not imagine how you could succeed with that may adds.  You could try having someone kite them away but really they would be taken care of while AEing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">snasty</div><div class="date">03-04-2005, 01:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">always used a bard da team - get a ae song going and have one bard da group then gather up adds and pull to back of cave and deftdance when da drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tuddar Raddut</div><div class="date">03-07-2005, 12:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Have a couple warriors run in right before raid attacks Coirnav and AE taunt and throw fortitude up. Drag as many of the adds out as you can out the SE corner, kite them around while raid kills Coirnav.<br />
<br />
Trick is just to have a couple folks aggro as many of the mobs around Coirnav as they can and kite them out just before raid arrives. Lots of classes capable of doing this.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">richardkent</div><div class="date">03-07-2005, 03:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We've tried pulling the adds out, but it never worked, folks trying it died too fast.  I also believe they warp back if you try to pull them out, been so long I've forgetten, just remember having a bard rush in and train them out did not work for us.  Also, you typically have little time left on the clock to kill Coirnav that you cannot waste time to gathering and kiting trash out of his area.<br />
<br />
So, we rush melee in, keeping DPS/casters at max range.  Keep in mind you have very little time to kill Coirnav as his AEs will wipe your forces, so it has to go fast, max burn.<br />
<br />
We've lost some of the tanks as a result, but our last 2 runs the MT stayed alive.<br />
<br />
Think we had 2 or 3 failures on rushing Coirnav but we had everyone rush in, which meant adds chomped our DPS.  Keeping them at max range made the difference in our wins (3 in a row or maybe 4).</div></div><hr />

Also, you typically have little time left on the clock to kill Coirnav that you cannot waste time to gathering and kiting trash out of his area. They do not warp back, I can assure you. As a tank that has done the AE taunt and train out, I can assure you it does work, because I did it just last week. Last time I played kiter I was able to snag about 10 mobs and keep them kited while raid was on Coirnav.<br />
<br />
1) As soon as last mini is within a few percent of dying, a couple warriors are waiting just outside Coirnav's lair.<br />
2) On last mini death warriors rush in heading straight for Coirnav, AE taunt, fortitude, and then swim SE and over wall<br />
3) A couple seconds after kiting warriors sent in, send in the raid. Depending on where raid set up AE camp at, it takes a couple seconds for raid to reach Coirnav's lair anyways, giving the kiters the time they need to grab mobs without slowing down the rest of raid.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">richardkent</div><div class="date">03-07-2005, 03:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Obviously Tuddar is correct, I think what I was confusing was that we tried to pull all of coirnav's trash and AE them like a normal wave, which resulted in them respawning immediately.  Seem to remember us trying that once as well.<br />
<br />
Personally, I remember a lot of lag when doing Coirnav which made it hard for us to successfully train the mobs out, why hinge your whole raid on moving those mobs out?<br />
<br />
Moving folks to max range to nuke/bow/etc with just your core tanks rushing coirnav is much quicker, imho and more tolerant of lag.  The heal aggro will peel the trash to your healers, where your enchanter/mezzer crews can ae control them, same as they did for the prior trash waves.<br />
<br />
But, whatever methods works for you works, so check each of them out and give'm a go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tuddar Raddut</div><div class="date">03-07-2005, 04:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The reason we train them out is because with the exception of a couple people training, everyone else is going full burn on Coirnav. Enchanters can nuke instead of worrying about CC. Warriors make good kiters, because they have discs for mitigating damage while kiting.<br />
<br />
It's not so much hinging your entire raid on trying to kite out every last mob. It's just expending a little coordination just prior to to the last mini dying to get *as many* of the little adds around Coirnav out of the way as you can. And with a little preparation, it doesn't slow the raid down at all, since warriors are prepositioned ahead of the raid so there is no waiting on them to go in and grab mobs. Last mini dies, raid moves to Coirnav. By time raid gets there, warriors have already snatched up what they can and kiting them away.<br />
<br />
But there's always a dozen ways to skin a cat. As long as he dies, your strategy is successful.  :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brokkah Narrow</div><div class="date">03-08-2005, 06:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We just fought with them in the lair lol, we didnt even bother healing the MTs as the clerics were too busy nuking too :) We just fort tanked until dead and let another warrior pick it up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">03-09-2005, 04:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well we'd tried having a bard kite them out.  He said it seemed like they would not leave the lair.  They stopped near an entrance and ended up eating some of our dpsers who came up there to nuke coirnav.  So we then operated on the assumption that the adds could not go beyond the walls of the lair.  Our attempt yesterday finally worked, but it was messy and took a large raid force to succeed.  We had 76 characters counting a few boxed ones.  Half a dozen or so died fighting the 3 minis.  We tried to root park two of them and for whatever reason failed at that, so we fought all 3 together.  <br />
<br />
Then there was squid boy.  Our bard modified his add aggro plan and stayed in the lair but as far on the opposite corner as he could.  He got a big chunk of the adds.  I was one of the first ones to coirnav and I aggroed a few of those that were left, so they spammed me with misses from fortitude for 12 seconds and then beat me down.  But I went down at 56% and I knew most people were still alive so we'd probably win.  We did, though I believe there were over 30 deaths in the process.  At least the squid was down!  <br />
<br />
Our necros then enjoyed having a pet that looked like Coirnav for a few minutes... :p</div></div><hr />
