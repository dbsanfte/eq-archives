<br />
I also have to do the Spiroc, Red Scale, and Golem to get epic.  <br />
<br />
1) Anyone know which holds aggro better?  <br />
<br />
2) Mebbe the red epic and CHSD (I dont got one either) aggro compared to GoT?<br />
<br />
If better, is it enough better that it is worth finshing epics for?  IF I will use the epics over GoT, then I can ask my guild to help with Spiroc.  If not, then they will kill me.</div></div><hr />

What i can say is that i have about the same aggro with both, exept when epic does not proc once in a fight (dps on gtot is better). But epic proc about 2 ou 3 times in a fight most of the time, so i prefer fight with epic :)</div></div><hr />

It's been a while since I played a warrior with an epic, but I know my GSoT procs like a 50mm cannon.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">QuirtEvans</div><div class="date">06-01-2003, 09:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I picked up a GoT yesterday on Saryrn for 10K.  I don't know what the seller was thinking.<br />
<br />
I used both the GoT and a windblade at a raid today.  I was MT part of the time, not all of the time.  My unparsed, general impressions:  the GoT does not proc like a cannon for me (228 DEX).  It procced a few times a fight.  When it procced, it definitely caught the mob's attention, whether or not the proc was resisted, unless our SK puller was trying to keep aggro, and if he was trying to keep aggro I really couldn't seize it away from him with either weapon.  DPS &quot;seemed&quot; a little worse than the windblade, aggro &quot;seemed&quot; quite a bit better, under raid conditions, than the windblade.  Compared to the dual wielding warrior who was MT part of the time (ordinary weapons, no special procs), both the GoT and the windblade would steal aggro from him, but the GoT would steal aggro more consistently and for longer periods.  <br />
<br />
My own conclusion: I'll keep the windblade and use it when I don't have to worry about keeping aggro or when I am not the MT.  When I am MT and really need to hold aggro, I'll use the GoT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rodney</div><div class="date">06-03-2003, 12:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can not judge proc rate by one or two fights it takes hrs to get a good number plus what you think you see and what happens are two different things.   I have logged many fights with both the GoT and ecpis (both 1hs and 2hs) and they all proc at the same rate. With 270-280 dex I get 1 proc every 30 sec no matter the zone.   There are times I would swear it was higher or lower but over hrs it comes 2 proc a min.   IF the epic is not resisted the two procs seem about the same for argo but if the epic is resisted then it seems to have far less argo.  The GoT does about 10 dps more then the epics, this seems to make a huge difference on how well taunt works on the times you do lose argo.   I seem to get argo much faster at the start of a fight with the GoT if I dont get a proc.<br />
<br />
    I see two problems with epics, first LOW DPS.  If you dont get a proc early then its hard to get argo based on  damage and taunt.  Next is the proc is fire based and on fire resist mobs it just dont pack the argo you need.<br />
<br />
   The biggest problem with GoT is the knock back, about 1 ft, you best be ready to follow the mob, but this is GOOD and BAD.<br />

most of the time i couldn't use it if I wasn't MT and stuck with KT axe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khumak</div><div class="date">06-03-2003, 02:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">IMO they need to change the proc on epic to be unresistable.  It would still be one of the crappier epics out there but at least then the aggro would be decent.  When I got my epic I found the red blade getting resisted so much that I quit using it and switched to the blue blade.  I got a bit jaded though because I got my BoC 2 days after I got my epic so it was VERY apparent how much the red blade was getting resisted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Truelove</div><div class="date">06-05-2003, 04:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I have both - the epic 2hander holds agro better. Hate proc &gt; stun imho. <br />
<br />
The guy is asking which is better - and we got a load of GoT huggers posting who have never got their epic. <br />
<br />
The other factor you need to take into account is getting the rest of your stuf for your epic - personally I think its a fag and you're better off pushing your guild to do AoW and pray for a BoC</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">06-05-2003, 01:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hate proc &gt; stun imho <br />
<br />
Only when hate proc is not resisted. A resisted stun proc is still good agro, a resisted hate proc sucks ass. While my warrior does not have epics (nor will he ever) I have logged many hours behind the wheel of an epic warrior. In cases where the epic proc is ot resisted - Velious mostly - then the epic is the superior weapon. Any place where the epic proc is going to be resisted, the stun proc is better because it doesn't matter if it is resisted or not. If the epic proc was unresistable like EB, then it would be a superior weapon.<br />
<br />
IMO the proc gets resisted too often and the DPS is very lacking to justify going through the trouble of getting your epic. If you are close and have done all the running around and only need 1 or 2 more item, then by all means go for it. If you are still quite a ways from epic or you are planning on purchasing MQs or scales, then forget it just get a GSoT. Better DPS and a proc that is on par with epic that you can buy for less than the cost of a green scale on many servers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tenakha</div><div class="date">06-05-2003, 05:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">*sigh* I really hate the warrior epic.  Its such a total piece of overrated junk it amazes me.  Dual priceless 13/20's with no proc outagrod (by a LOT) both epic blades back in the day.  So its really not a question, any warrior who can get his/her epic is better off selling the green scale and buying better weapons in the bazaar for just the selling price of the scale.  So there is no situation whatsoever where a warrior should ever use either epic blade or 2h epic IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">06-06-2003, 01:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, this is purely anecdotal so take it for what you like, but this is my personal experience with GSoT vs. duel weilding epics.<br />
<br />
Last night we did a late night Vindi kill to get a guildie a BP. A Temple Guardian added once we had Vindi pulled so I put Moordian on him to off tank. At the same time another guildie turned their 2-boxed 61 warrior on the Guardian to off tank.<br />
<br />
Both warriors 2-boxed, neither with any significant AAs. It took 5-10 seconds for agro to establish, but after that time, the Guardian stuck to Moordian like glue. The 61 war never turned the mob a single time once agro was established. I am not sure if the 61 went defensive since I was too far away to see the emote, but Moordian was defensive once the Guardian was on him.<br />
<br />
IMO this was a pretty definitive test. No one else on the mobs with at least the GSoT weilder using disc. Flawless agro. This pretty much cements my opinion that GSoT is the weapon to have until you can get 2x EB or a BoW (or miniBoW from Inny).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Snowz</div><div class="date">06-06-2003, 02:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm amazed that the Warrior epic to this day still gets bashed to all hell. If the Blade of Tactics said &quot;Vengeance VI (worn)&quot; rather than Rage of Tallon, I doubt people would jump on the bashing band wagon. <br />
<br />
Does the Epic have flaws? You bet it does. Are there better weapons out there? You bet there are. To say the Epics have no situational use what so ever seems rather harsh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tsaotsao</div><div class="date">06-06-2003, 05:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, with all this said, I still want the epic. Need to do Spirocs, Hate(Hand) and Fear(Ball).  I am wondering if the Maestro is even doable by a mid-level guild now. We tried Hate, but the Maestro wasn't up (so we couldn't find out just how hard he was). Hate is a lot easier to get going in now than it was. And it is still fun!!!<br />
<br />
So, if anyone on Terris Thule needs an L58 warrior in their PoSky, Hate, or Fear raids, send me a tell. I want to go as much for learning the raids as anything. If I am eligible for a drop fine, if not fine.. the experience makes me a better warrior.<br />

Good news is that the Hand spawn is independent of Maestro in another room. Hand is still a push over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pris Silklover</div><div class="date">06-09-2003, 02:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've used a Greatstaff of Thunder the past few days in Storms, Tactics, and Old Seb, and my experience was the thing hardly ever procs (dex=265). 2h epic proc'd much more frequently. I haven't parsed this, it's just subjective/anecdotal. I'm even wondering if the damage from the procs might equalize the dps (doubt it).<br />
<br />
I'll give it a longer trial.</div></div><hr />
