Face slot, 20 AC, I think 15 STR.  Drops off the goranga seer, a rare spawn at either the tree or where the three goranga scouts spawn.  The warrior should be able to single pull most of the spawns at the tree, you'll have to fool around some with the scouts, they will come three at a time.  If the goranga chieftain spawns at the tree, your chanter or cleric or druid will get a shot at a very nice range slot item (15 ac, 15 wis, 15 int, iirc).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fvighlander</div><div class="date">06-28-2003, 11:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Two words for ya... Cazic Thule :) The group you mentioned should be able to farm some nice gear there. In the sewers camp, you have a shot at Mosquito Leg Earrings, the Heavy Rubicite Girdle, and also FT3 boots for casters.<br />
<br />
You could also try 4C camp sometime. A fleshgrinder would go well with your Shortblade of Lightning.<br />
<br />
Most of the good drops there are not no-drop, so if you get something no one in your group needs as an upgrade, you could get lucky and win a nice item to sell for 20-50k in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />

However, you have a chanter in the group to mez, and two rangers with Harmony who can snag singles if that option bothers ya. CT is an outdoor zone.</div></div><hr />
