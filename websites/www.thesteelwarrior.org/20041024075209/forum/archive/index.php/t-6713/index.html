About the Coldain Ring Quest --<br />
Some pitfalls to avoid: <br />
Don't let your druid friends turn anybody into a wolf at any point while you're doing the quests. Imagine how bad it sucks to have the guy you're escorting across the zone suddenly decide that he needs to attack you. I riposted one of them to death while trying to camp.<br />
On the 7th ring, don't hand the Dwarf anything (like your ring - Doh!) to try to get him going again after you defeat the giant/orc party that jumps you during the escort. He won't give the ring back before he poofs, and you get to start over (or whine to a GM).<br />
On the 8th ring, make SURE both NPCs are up before you do your hand in. The second NPC (some dwarf wench) is NOT spawned by the hand-in; she's got to be up already on her own spawn timer.<br />
<br />
Good luck!<br />

Thanks for the tips.  I have done the first, have all the items for the third (just need to get Crafting up some) and am going to try to get the 2nd/3rd done this weekend, so those later ones will be coming up shortly.</div></div><hr />

Just get someone who has sufficent skill in that area and MQ it with you.  Currently what I am doing for Ring #9, not gonna sit at a brew barrel all day when I could request it be made by a guildie.</div></div><hr />

That's good to know, I knew the resultant item from the combine is NO DROP so I thought I had to make it, but I do have to turn in the ring so that'll work.  I have someone with skill that high to do it...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Derrict</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I did the brewing portion MQ for a friend.  It does require you to bring your brewer along for  no drop items (CS drakes) but these are easy to kill at 65.  Most of the other items can be found in the bazaar if you don't want to camp the pieces.</div></div><hr />

Wow, a Hoss member :)  Kidding!  I was on Druzzil Ro for quite a bit in Pactus Aquilus before moving over to Maelin Starpyle and it was a rare sight to see a Hoss member sitting around in PoT.  I'd walk around and /bow to them when I did see them! haha<br />
<br />
I'm only 60th level but my brewer in question is a 65 Shadow Knight so it should be no problem, as he can mostly solo the ring quests up to 8th or at the least two-box with his 65 Druid.<br />
<br />
But tonight, Coldain Rings are put to the side, it's our first Vex Thal raid and I'm going to be there no matter what; got my key completed last night.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A 65 SK can solo up to ring 9 so it should be no problem.  1 HT and the ring 9 mob, once triggered, is dead lol.</div></div><hr />

Now just need number 10!</div></div><hr />

Can a 65 War solo 1-8?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Crathsor Gnawbones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I managed to do this quest with a 65 Shaman all the way to the 8th ring.  9th ring can be done with one group.  Need one other tank to cover the second giant from plate cycle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gorlab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">How few people does it take to do the 10th ring war these days?  I'd imaging you still need some numbers just from the sheer number of giants that come at you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Azaza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Arguably, it's just a matter of who shows up... 2 or 3 groups possibly but need some fairly busy people on crowd control.<br />
<br />
Plus, you usually get a dozen people (or more) that aren't in your raid and just tag along to get faction and join the fun.<br />

*shrug*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>NhuakofBrell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Yes a well equipped 65 warrior can  solo  1 through 8 ....  My ranger that  has about  7500 hp  buffed can  solo all of it  up to  9 =)  I would  however  bring a   healer along of  any kind if you  plan on doing 1-8  all at  once.</div></div><hr />
