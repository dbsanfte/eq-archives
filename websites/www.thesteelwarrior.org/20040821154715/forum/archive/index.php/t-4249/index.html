Speaking as a necromancer who was lead here due to the oversaturation of linkage in relation to this farce in a variety of forums, all I can say is that this is pretty @#% pathetic.  <br />
<br />
Aw...is the little warrior having some trouble finding a group when he goes LFG?  Only getting one or two tells instead of 25 when you want something to do?  That's so sad.  Oh, wait.  No it isn't.  It's just what EVERY OTHER CLASS has to go through.  I mean seriously, do you guys really think you can get sympathy acting like spoiled little PoK revolutionaries in a world where Necro's are consigned as mana batteries and countless other classes have dealt with awful grouping situations for years?<br />
<br />
How is it that suddenly its a huge injustice when its YOUR class that has some trouble getting a group?  Suddenly its justified to harm other people's gametime by blocking access to somewhere so integral as PoT (And don't even try saying you people aren't, just look at the screenshots on the first page and try picking out room for the amount of traffic that needs access to that gate you two-year-olds are so gleefully blocking) because you're pissed you aren't a neccesity?  <br />
<br />
As so many people have said to my class over the years, #%@ deal with it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
2)  Anyone blocking stone access should be /petitioned immediately if they refuse to move.  End of story.  We as a group don't want to block access.  If some uninformed/immature people do...well, that's kind of on them, not the warrior community.<br />

You know that something isn't right when you are using the same disclaimer warez sites use to stay operational.<br />
<br />
And you can hardly complain about people showing up here after infecting every corner of the EQ community with links to this lovely little gathering.  <br />
<br />
Are there balancing issues?  Of course.  In a game that is patched every two seconds there will ALWAYS be balancing issues.  That doesn't give you the right to harm other people's gameplay, nor does it make you some sort of pariah in the EQ community.  EVERY class has had problems with grouping at some time or another, many far worse than the tribulations you are now experiencing.  Don't recall seeing 200 necros (or any other class) screwing over people trying to get into PoT.  Change your diaper, throw out the sour grapes, and get the hell out of our way in PoK.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well there ya go then.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;That doesn't give you the right to harm other people's gameplay,&quot;<br />
<br />
Standing AFK in Plane of Knowledge doesn't harm anyone's gameplay.<br />
<br />
I've stood AFK and LFG in that zone for hours upon hours upon hours. No one EVER had a problem with it before.<br />
<br />
People can still get to their precious transport stone.<br />
<br />
&quot;EVERY class has had problems with grouping at some time or another,&quot;<br />
<br />
Clerics have never had a problem with grouping, at any time or another. And much like warriors, clerics are extremely group dependant.<br />
<br />
Your class, however, is traditionally NOT group dependent.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't recall seeing 200 necros (or any other class) screwing over people trying to get into PoT.&quot;<br />
<br />
Again, people can access the stone. So it's not screwing anyone over.<br />
<br />
&quot;Change your diaper, throw out the sour grapes, and get the hell out of our way in PoK.&quot;<br />
<br />
The only person acting like a 2-year old with a smelly diaper here is the person saying things like &quot;get the hell out of our way in PoK.&quot;<br />

If these people were standing there milling about, say, three weeks ago, you'd not have bothered to NOTICE, let alone make this post.<br />

<br />
Come on don't be obtuse.  You see what I see: people blocking the most common access point to the stone which really detracts from any message we all want to send.  Leave a clear path (it was very clearly shown in the diagram posted by the organizer) so people don't use that as a reason to hate us.<br />

GM's came and watched us on SolRo, and didn't say a word, because we were NOT blocking access to the PoT stone.</div></div><hr />

Man you guys just don't get it: THE POINT OF THIS TYPE OF PROTEST IS TO RAISE AWARENESS WITHOUT INFLICTING INCONVENIENCE ON YOUR FELLOW GAMERS.<br />
<br />
Yes it sounds like you are within the &quot;letter&quot; of the law. But all you are doin is pissin people off by making them run around you. Is that the message you want to send?  <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey guys: we want you to listen to us because we are going to make you run around us (therebye pissing you off) first?&quot;  13 year olds act like that. <br />
<br />
For reference: note where most of the rest of the warriors are standing OFF TO THE SIDE AND NOT BLOCKING THE STONE FROM ANY ANGLE (yes this means ALL your impact of protest is caused by you being there NOT blocking anyones access).<br />
<br />
/shrug I've said my piece...we can agree to disagree...I think you are hurting the cause by doing this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Grimpond</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">I totally see your point Flair. <br />
<br />
Perhaps I should clarify some things on SolRo Thursday night.  The vast majority of warriors were not blocking the steps but rather stood in the grass around the front side of the PoT stone.  Some ass-clown paladin thought it'd be cool to go block the PoT stone steps, and he soon got some mini-support, Jerry's Kids must have had some 'puter time I guess.  Warriors on our server repeatedly made sure that PoT stone access would not be blocked, because, we really do see your point about not disrupting, and especially not pissing off fellow gamers.<br />
<br />
As a new player would show up to show support, we'd guide 'em to a spot that wouldn't screw up things for other players.<br />
<br />
It appears someone petitioned because of the insane lag PoK was having, especially around the PoT stone (multiply big bank lag by 10).  The GM's came, and saw that Warriors were directing other Warriors on where to stand.  Ass-clown paladin was either told to move, or realized how stupid he was and he took his cronies with him.<br />
<br />
This is (I believe) why the GM's didn't say anything to us Warriors that were there: they saw us being peaceful, and doing our best not to disrupt other players.  There were a few times when the steps weren't blocked at all (front or back), and some ass-bag would show up and say he petioned because we blocked off PoT access.  This just wasn't the case, and the GM's saw it.<br />
<br />
On SolRo we really did try to not only follow the &quot;letter&quot; of the law, but also the &quot;spirit&quot; of the law while I was online.<br />
<br />
*edit*  We really did have a HUGE turnout, lotsa pissed warriors standing proud, and I was very proud to be a small ogre-sized part of it, :p</div></div><hr />

Access to the stone still exists.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thus you are not inconvenienced in any way.<br />
<br />
You can either:<br />
<br />
1- Walk through the crowd of people and still get to the stone.<br />
<br />
or <br />
<br />
2- Walk around back and get to the stone.<br />
<br />
The only inconvenience is that you don't want to wade through a bunch of people.<br />
<br />
Which, you KNOW, I've had to do MANY TIMES around the NEXUS stone where people constantly sell buffs on my server.<br />
<br />
So I have no sympathy for this so-called inconvenience.</div></div><hr />

<br />

That's the way to keep this shit in order.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Alxandra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">As a ranger on EMarr, I found out about the protest when I ran to the POT stone for a MGB of KEI and found myself surrounded by Warriors.  It was the smartest group of warriors that I have ever been surrounded by.<br />
<br />
That first screenshot was exactly like it looked except that you needed a wider angle because you missed the people on the edges.<br />
<br />
I found out about the protest from my ex-guild leader who was protesting there, and I think I can make him out in that screen shot although the font is pretty small, and it is a tad blurry.<br />
<br />
Anyways, the POT stone is NOT blocked.  It is easily accessed from behind.   Although zoning back from POT is difficult, the lag is just atrocious.  But, heh, you just take a quick refreshment break, and it's not all that bad when you get back.<br />
<br />
I dont particularly understand all of the issues involved.  To be honest, I just dont have the ability to be a warrior.  My warrior alt retired at level 9 to a life as a merchant in the bazaar.  However, I do know how frustrating it can be to be undesired in groups.  (I'm a ranger, eh?)  And, unfortunately, it appears that you needed to go to this length to have your issues addressed.  <br />
<br />
But, I must say it is a pleasure to see such a well-organized protest that is peaceful.  You are doing a very good job of communicating your concerns without hurting others in the process.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And don't compare us to 320+ dps on time god necros, please.</div></div><hr />

Listen sport, when your penis changes from an 'inny' to an 'outie' you'll have right to speak to me directly. Until then refer to me through a third party and call me Mr. Frodo.  <br />
<br />
The lack of intelligence on this board sickens me.  If you are too stupid to respond in anything other than two line personal attacks then you aren't even worth my time, as you obviously cannot even begin to construct anything resembling a coherent and thoughtful response.<br />

Yes it sounds like you are within the &quot;letter&quot; of the law. But all you are doin is pissin people off by making them run around you. Is that the message you want to send?  <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey guys: we want you to listen to us because we are going to make you run around us (therebye pissing you off) first?&quot;  13 year olds act like that. <br />
<br />
For reference: note where most of the rest of the warriors are standing OFF TO THE SIDE AND NOT BLOCKING THE STONE FROM ANY ANGLE (yes this means ALL your impact of protest is caused by you being there NOT blocking anyones access).<br />
<br />
/shrug I've said my piece...we can agree to disagree...I think you are hurting the cause by doing this.  <br />
<br />
Notice that this is the EXACT SAME POINT, just made by someone with a larger post count number.  It was recieved fairly.<br />
<br />
Elitism is an ugly thing, especially on something so insigificant as an internet message board.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">Erm... no Sortas, its very far from being the same point you made...<br />
<br />
Your point was that our StandDown is retarded, we shouldn't whine because we aren't that broken etc... <br />
(correct me if I'm wrong)<br />
<br />
The point made by Flair, was how the StandDown should be kept civil and fair. He still supports the StandDown, as long as people aren't blocking issues and annoying people. (The whole concept of this standdown is to be seen without annoying anyone, read Darkoan's Standdown thread)<br />
<br />
You seem to have come on this thread just to let out your frusteration, you haven't been directly annoyed by any warrior in PoK or anything...<br />
but you're annoyed to see a class, of which you have no clue, protesting. Why?<br />
Have you ever played a Warrior? if not.. either you trust the majority of the Warrior community and join them,<br />
or you don't and shut up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And notice I said the EXACT SAME THING to Flair.<br />
<br />
It's not an inconvenience. You two just THINK it is.<br />
<br />
But I've been &quot;inconvenienced&quot; the exact same way MANY TIMES in PoK NORMALLY. It's a high traffic zone. Two specific stones (tranq and nexus) are constantly crowded on my server.<br />
<br />
And lag is just par for the course in high traffic zones.<br />
<br />
So your whine is just bullshit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Sortas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">Actually my point was that no amount of imbalance gives you the right to screw over other people who are paying the same fees you are.  If you want to protest go right ahead, but do it five feet to the left.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Shodon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">Veeshan at 5:20pm GMT. Nice to see some support from other classes. Oh, and props to Nabby. Looks like he reactivated his account and has been there since the start :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Malfranic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">Can't find a group?  Try playing a magician.  :)<br />
<br />
And no we can't solo; solo exp sucks anyway.  I hope you guys get what you want.  It will make the game easier for all of us. <br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>slyse</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">It's not about making the game easier.  If you want an easy grind (as it stands now), go with a knight.<br />
<br />
This is about making the game better.<br />
<br />
Edit: clarification</div></div><hr />

You say its not worth your time posting here then why are you still posting?  Seems like you are saying you don't like posting here because we don't listen to you, yet you are doing it anyway.  How smart is that?  Personally, I think you are just some guy who needs attention and just came here to stir up shit.</div></div><hr />

That was directed at Furor and his entire avoidance of anything resembling an actual point, as anyone with even a basic level of reading comprehension should have been able to follow.</div></div><hr />
