<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neksnappa</div><div class="date">02-09-2004, 04:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got my bertox flag last night, after having gotten the kos and saryrn flags around 2 weeks ago. However, according to the quotes I'm getting from the seer in PoK, I have not completed kos/saryrn. I know I read here somewhere that this was a bug, and that if you killed kos/saryrn before getting tt or bertox, you would have to go back and do kos/saryrn again. I am almost positive this is what has happened to me, because I am still getting the &quot;Although it was kind of you to help him, Tylis still has no idea who you are&quot; when I talk to the seer. I should be getting &quot;Tylis has been removed from his agony&quot; since I've done kos. Does anyone know if there is a way to fix this without raiding kos/saryrn again? Or would a guide/gm possibly be able to resolve this? Thanks,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">02-09-2004, 05:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Post your entire Seer text, both guided meditation and unlock memories if you have any. You are correct, the line you get indicates an incomplete Saryrn/Bertox chain. It could just be a missing preflag.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">02-09-2004, 05:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The sick bay is kinda messy for flags, you need Grummus,  Hedge, Terris and Bert to finish your Saryrn flag, and each one of those has associated preflags that you need to get from the sickbay.<br />
<br />
The most common step thats missed is after bert where you have to talk to Tylis Newleaf and say something along the lines of &quot;what black cube&quot; to get the KoS preflag.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kabal</div><div class="date">02-09-2004, 05:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah i had some trouble with this also...I killed grummus then did KoS/Saryn then hedge, TT, and bert...when i went to do flag it was all messed up I had to make about 6 trips between the sick bay and the seer...plus i just went back thru and re hailed all the preflags and stuff in the correct order...it finally worked for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">02-09-2004, 05:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i agree with the above poster. make a few more trips between sick bay and the seer. i had to to that a few times when i got some flags backwards. <br />
 make sure you have all your preflags.<br />
 if you still dont have it then then its likely a bug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shadowedspawn</div><div class="date">02-09-2004, 06:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just what the above have said.  When you talked to the chick in sickbay about Saryrn did she give you the dialouge about the black box?  For myself it took me about 10 trips back and forth between a guildie brought that up.  She had never given it to me before but when I asked her &quot;what Black box&quot; it was just a short trip back to the Seer to get my flags all in the right order.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frodlin7th</div><div class="date">02-09-2004, 06:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The following is what you need to do to ensure that your flags have had the appropriate &quot;oil change&quot;.<br />
<br />
- When you killed Grummus, did you first go to Myelik outside of PoD and ask &quot;what ward&quot;?  If not, go do so.<br />
<br />
- This one is gay... when you killed Grummus, did you zone into CoD *from his lair*?  If not, you must go back and zone into CoD From grummus' lair.   <br />
<br />
- After Killing Grummus, did you return to Myelik and Hail him and get the next flag?   Try doing so.<br />
<br />
- After Hailing Myelik, did you go to the sick bay and hail Elder Fuierstel?   Try it a couple of times, since you need one flag before killing Bertox and one Afterwards.<br />
<br />
- When you did the Hedge Maze, did you go to Elder Poxbourne in the sick bay?   If not, hail him.   <br />
<br />
- After killing Terris Thule, did you go hail Elder Poxbourne in the sick bay and get flagged?  If not do so.<br />
<br />
- Did you hail Fahlia Shadyglade in the PoT sick bay?   Did she talk to you?   If so, then tell her &quot;I will go to Torment&quot; (note:  you can NOT say &quot;I will go the plane of Torment&quot; because the game doesn't recognize a &quot;plane of Torment&quot;, it is &quot;Torment, the Plane of Pain&quot;).  That is the Keeper of Sorrows Pre-flag, after saying that, hail her again for the Tylis Newleaf flag.<br />
<br />
- After doing so, go to Maelin Starpyre in the PoK library... he's messed up a little too.   First hail him, then say &quot;I have information&quot; then say &quot;I have lore&quot;.... then go to Seer, and AGAIN go back to him, hail him and say &quot;I have new information&quot; and &quot;I have new lore&quot;.<br />
<br />
As others have said, many times it takes a few trips to the seer to unlock memories to get this &quot;oil change&quot;.<br />
<br />
If you are certain that you did the grummus pre-flag mess and zoned into CoD by Grummus, then go to the sick hut, and Hail Elder Poxbourne, and Elder Fuierstel (you'll get flags every time you hail them), then try to go to Fahlia and Hail her, if she's willing to talk, then say &quot;I will go to torment&quot; then hail her again, if she's NOT willing to talk and you got flags from both Fuierstel and Poxbourne, then go to seer, and repeat.<br />
<br />
If you have any additional trouble and I'm on EQ, you can send me a tell at seventh.Frodlin, and I'll try to walk you through it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neksnappa</div><div class="date">02-09-2004, 07:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay thank you all for your very helpful information. Logging on EQ as I type this, and I'll go through all the steps provided.<br />
<br />
&lt;Edit&gt; Okay looks like I've got it all cleared up, just need 1st hoh trial, LMM, and RZtW i believe. <br />
<br />
Also, is the manaetic behemoth required at all? And shouldn't I receive improved charm stats and an aa or two when I talk about stories with the dorf near the PoK Seer?<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jakle Attakle</div><div class="date">02-09-2004, 08:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When did they change that Grummus requirement Frod?<br />
<br />
I did my Grummus in February of 2003, and you didnt need to zone in from there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Binnamar</div><div class="date">02-09-2004, 10:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you're looking to get into SolRo (which I assume you are), then you need to get those flags before you can zone in.<br />
<br />
That means; Killing Behemoth, All HoH trials, Mith Marr, Vallon Zek, Tallon Zek, Grummus, Terris, Bert, PoV Dragon (Arien`dar?), Saryrn, and Keeper of souls. Oh yah, also need PoV/PoS trials.<br />
<br />
<br />
You won't get an AA for completing Bertoxx without all those other flags too.<br />
<br />
Rallos Zek, Agnarr, and BoT key quest are NOT needed for SolRo, they are only needed for elementals.<br />
<br />
So basically unless you are ready to zone into elementals/solro it isn't neccissary at this point to work your preflags. I do reccomend it however, because it's a pain in the ass to do that when you want ot get into SolRo ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frodlin7th</div><div class="date">02-09-2004, 10:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dunno when they changed it but I actually had to GO BACK and zone into CoD from Grummus lair (This was pre-leash when I killed him, and post-leash when I had to redo it).    There was a message on my Seer info that said something about it.  There's a series of little &quot;must dos&quot;.<br />
<br />
- Must zone into CoD from Grummus' lair<br />
<br />
- Must zone into PoFire from Sol Ro Chamber to be flagged for Fire<br />
<br />
- Must be literally ported out by Karana after killing Agnarr (no TL's or ports)<br />
<br />
- Must zone into Time the first time from PoInnovation<br />
<br />
Insofar as Manaetic Behemoth, yes, you'll need it to complete the RZTW portion of your flag.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
What do you have to say to trigger that ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">02-09-2004, 11:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Regarding Grummus:<br />
Did him recently, and did not zone into CoD from his lair.  Seer gives me this:  Now that Grummus has been destroyed, the entrance to the Crypt of Bertoxxulous should open before your might.<br />
Did the pre and post flag hailings and such, sounds like the correct text without zoning into CoD from PoD, unless I am mistaken.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">02-10-2004, 05:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">At least Grummus and PoFire have been changed so you do not have to zone in from Grummus/Sol Ro's lairs. You will still get the flags and the proper text, but not until you zone in one way or another. It is still easiest to do it from the lair after the kill, but not necessary any more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neksnappa</div><div class="date">02-10-2004, 07:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, thank you all again for your help. Looks like all I need for solro is MB, 1st hoh trial, and LMM. And then RZtW (who my guild killed last night for first time, but &gt; 72 ppl needed flag, so I did not get one. No BoW drop either =/ ) and Agnarr for ele planes. Good to know that I'm moving right along, and now I know why I haven't received AAs/charm upgrades for my recent flags.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neksnappa</div><div class="date">02-10-2004, 01:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Those 5hp/mana upgrades you posted, Jakle, are the upgrades for the adventurers stone augment, which goes in the charm. I'm talking about the wooden figure charm itself, which is supposed to &quot;gain in power as you gain access to more planes.&quot; It looks like you need to have all previous flags to receive the upgrade/aa for a later flag, which I think explains why I have not gotten the upgrades.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bigchest</div><div class="date">02-10-2004, 05:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i thought i remembered askr porting me out first time i did it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jakle Attakle</div><div class="date">02-10-2004, 05:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was talking about that as well. Instead of getting 7 quick upgrades to charm through flags then needing 50 million checklist flags to get one more upgrade, they should have smoothed it out a lot more.<br />

true or false?</div></div><hr />

<br />
You no longer need Karana to send you on your way after you get the &quot;path of the fallen&quot; flag.<br />
<br />
You no longer need to zone into HOH behind AD the first time.  <br />
<br />
You no longer need AD at all, as long as you don't mind being raided into HOHB to get LMM.<br />
<br />
As far as I know, you no longer need to zone into PoFire from SolRo the first time either, but I don't have firsthand info about this one.<br />
<br />
I think all of these were made simpler when the lower zones were opened to everyone.</div></div><hr />
