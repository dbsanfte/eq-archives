<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Timrum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all <br />
<br />
Ok i think i have not so bad gear for my level, but i have 17k in bank atm and can get ~20k if needed - Magelo is in Sig. <br />
<br />
I want to ask if there is a nice upgrade for my Frostbringer - i real like frosty and the proc is sweet  - but maybe ther is something better in my priceclass ;) (if possible also with a good proc)<br />
<br />
Thx @ all ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">people say new smithed yaks<br />
<br />
at 17k your in the middle. theirs higher up and thats about it. maybe try a good 2h.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Caeden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">3 things:<br />
<br />
Player-made Yak, like Dobbo said.<br />
<br />
Wavecrasher, it's great for aggro, at a loss in DPS, It's really you're call on this one, if it'd be worth it, knowing that it's Primary only.<br />
<br />
Only other thing would be a FG, but unless you get a GREAT deal, it's a a little outta you're price range right now.  But may be something worth saving up for?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">From the revamped Droga:<br />
<br />
Copper Hammer of Striking (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=22010) <br />
<br />
Sword of the Bloodsworn (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=22009)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Timrum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">at first thx everyone :)<br />
<br />
<br />
i have a War Marshalls Bladed Staff atm and i love it :D<br />
<br />
BTW i think my first post was a bit cunfising i mean i can get ~20k more to a total af around 37k<br />
<br />
<br />
My Wavecrasher is for sale atm. But when i have to chose between SBoL and Wave i take the SBoL<br />
<br />
i think i will look for on of this Cooper Hammer of Striking - i like the stun component on the proc :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wratth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I use Barnacle Covered Axe and Heartspike.<br />
<br />
Sometimes I need to use a different weapon other than Heartspike if I think mezing will be needed.<br />
<br />
Best part about these two weapons is you can quest one (Heartspike, Bone-something is name for the weapon good races get) and the BCA is 500-1000pp. The hard part of the quest for Heartspike is you will need to kill about 350-450 level 56ish mobs to get the 4 of the flesh you need(bout 1 drop per 100). Good thing tho is a few other drops come from those guys so getting wizzies and healers to help should not be too hard. The other 4 flesh is easy and the 60 sk you kill is a wuss with necro and pally.<br />
<br />
<br />
I never have a agro problem, unless of corse ench leads with tash right of bat or something like that. I usually group with people 2-4 levels higher then me cause of my gear as well.<br />
<br />
I would stay away from Wavecrasher. The agro effect is in debate about how much, if any, agro is put out on proc of slowed mob and once you get in 50s every mob you fight will be slowed just about.<br />
<br />
Also those weapons from Droga should be real nice agro, with the dam+stun procs.</div></div><hr />
