Anyone find any use to preserving any faction thusfar?<br />
<br />
I've just been killing whatever when I'm there, and I'm gonna be hoping it doesn't screw me over in the long run.<br />
<br />
I'm somewhat inclined to belive that the factions really aren't that big of a deal, but I could be wrong.</div></div><hr />

Apparently all the Redcon Dragorns that are sitting around but hiss and do nothing are on Dranik Loyalist faction.  As your Loyalist faction goes up, certain ones start to talk to you; and presumably more as you gain more faction.<br />
<br />
The dude by the harbringer's zone was the first to speak to me - somewhere in the middle of threateningly, he talks about a quest for kyv hearts.  Giving him 2 kyv hearts  (dropped from ruins of dranik) netted 2x faction message (+loyalist -mata) and nothing else.  <br />
<br />
The guy on the WOS side of causeway is also speaking to me now, he mentions he wants murkglider blood.  The guy in the north-middle of WOS, Verow, responds to hails, but won't respond to his next trigger phrase yet.  I'm still somewhere in threateningly.<br />
<br />
It seems rather obvious to me that as you gain more faction, more and more of the redcons (and there seems to be quite a bit of them) will start talking to you and most likely giving more quests.<br />
<br />
I have a hard time believing that the Childrens fraction and the riftseekers are useful though - when you first enter oow apparently you're maxed to both of them, and that's still kos.  I could be wrong though.  Anyways slightly off topic, but i  guess i wanted to point out there is at least some point in focusing more on the god-models that are on mata faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think the factions are mixed up.  Riftseekers are supposed to be guys working for Mata Muram (manual says they're there to help him open rifts to other worlds, hence the name).  Children of Dranik appear to be the enslaved Dragorn that are under Muramite rule, and hence KOS against you.  Both of these faction should start be KOS, not max ally, unless there is another camp of Dragorn hiding somewhere on their own faction.<br />
<br />
And some of the KOS dragorns you kill will give you -children and +mata muram faction.  The fact that you can even get +faction from the leader of the bad guys seem to suggest a bug too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Priyme War'Cloud</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Good info, will try and find some more out</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bulbog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">A guildy read this no drop note that read something along the lines of capturing someone in the Riftseeker's Sanctum and returning him to the Citadel of Anguish alive, orders given by Mata Muram!  I have yet to explore Riftseeker's though to know what type of mobs are in there though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Callon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Many dragorn you kill in wos just give a negative children of dragorn faction.  Do some give negative dragorn loyalists too?<br />
<br />
I joined a pickup group in wos yesterday where a couple people refused to kill any dragorns at all.  sigh.</div></div><hr />
