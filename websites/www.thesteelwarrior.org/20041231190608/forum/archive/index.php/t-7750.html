<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ariene</div><div class="date">06-23-2004, 06:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Brutul's post in the Outhouse about getting one rounded got derailed into what I thought was an interesting discussion.  Not sure if it didn't get a lot of posts because it was outhouse or because most warriors don't like or care about the idea so reposting where people can see it to see what people think. :)<br />
<br />
I hope clerics asked for an OoW AA that rises the DI triger level<br />
<br />
Clerics already have an AA that increases the chance of sucess (if I remember correctly up to 95% with good CHA). <br />
<br />
I think it would make more sense for the new AA to be on the tank...<br />
<br />
Make it start checking at 20% instead of 15% which would decrease the amount of times it fails because it never got a chance to fire.<br />
<br />
I was thinking all tank classes could get the AA but actually since DI is almost exclusively a raid tool and raids are where things hit hard enough to need a bigger check range... it might be a good warrior class AA. Getting those extra chances for DI to trigger might further set warriors apart as the raid tank without hurting a knight ability to xp group tank at all.<br />
<br />
<br />
^^ I like your idea<br />
<br />
I dont think I like this as much though.  Think about how many times you go down to 1bub of health.  15% isnt too far off from 20%, but that would mean that DI will fire more often not only on times you are hit from 20% to 0, but when a round takes you to 18% right before a heal lands.<br />
<br />
Just something to think about<br />
<br />
When you have DI on, 20% is plenty low enough. You don't really want to be going lower than that on any mobs. Mob damage skipping over DI is much, much worse than it going off too often.<br />
<br />
&lt;not quoting discussion about what DI does - can read it in Outhouse thread if you are interested&gt;<br />
<br />
The main problem with DI nowdays isn't the fail rate. I don't think you can get much better then 95%. The problem is that some mobs hit so hard that it never gets a chance to check.<br />
<br />
On a 10k tank, 15% is 1.5k HPs. Nowdays, a LOT of raid mobs hit harder than that. Even 20% is only 2k HPs - by elementals you are running into 3k hitters so this still wouldn't save you all the time but would give more of a chance for there to be a chance for it to fire.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what high end tanks are up to these days but 20% of 12k is still only 2.4k so again its not a free ride. You'd have to get up to 15k HPs before you could have a 3k safe zone. I'm sure there are tanks that will get there but when they do the mobs will probably be hitting harder then 3k anyway?<br />
<br />
I wouldn't mind it firing more often. I hate it when it never has a chance to fire and we lose a tank.<br />
<br />
Sooo... <br />
<br />
Would this be useful or a complete waste of AA?  <br />
<br />
If so, should it be for all classes (we DI enchanters and clerics often as well as pullers and misc others depending on situation) or just tanks or just warriors?  I haven't made up my mind on what I think here.  Warriors just by having more HPs innately have a better chance of this working then other classes so not sure it really matters.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I suggested for an Innate DI (With of course a huge reusal and short duration)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">06-24-2004, 11:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If they want to make a spell like DI central to raiding, AND keep it there, that AA would be feasible and usefull. If they decide to nerf DI or make it less required, the AA would be crappy.<br />
<br />
  What about an AA that increases the effect of healing spells cast on you? Like a reverse Balance of Zebuxoruk of sorts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Holywrath</div><div class="date">06-24-2004, 11:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd gladly spend my AA points into an ability like this.  You beckon to the gods for a divine intervention.. and then you get it!<br />
<br />
Even raising the % at which it goes off would be nice.  5 percent per level at 3 levels?  30percent is... pretty realistic.  Id rather have DI fire way too often than never at all.<br />
<br />
On a side note, I'd really like to see CH upgraded.  Tonight for me, was the first knowingly time I got jacked by it.  After dieing to a mob that really isn't that tough, I decided to scroll up and check out what happened.  The heals were on, however CH just didn't land for enough.  I got healed for 7985 or something like that (cleric CH) and then took a pretty tough round for 9.3k.  We were limited on how fast the chain could run due to a lack of clerics.   Even still, it's pretty rediculous that we have 13k tanks and CH lands for.. around 60~ percent of a warriors total hitpoints.  It doesn't seem very complete to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gryzx</div><div class="date">06-24-2004, 11:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Clerics already have aa's to improve CH, it currently goes to 19% better.  (max CH is 8925 with aa's).  8925 is pretty good, but I agree that it might be nice for them to get another set to extend that further.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">06-24-2004, 12:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">CH is a level 39 spell. It's WAY WAY overpowered already, at best. At worst it's game unbalancing. CH chains have been one of the silliest things in EQ for a very long time. I'd much prefer they just added a faster cast 10khp heal for like 2k mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Omnus</div><div class="date">06-24-2004, 12:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am of the opinion alot of clerics don't do get heavily into doing aa's because most of their aa's suck and are not worth the time. Although I am veyr thankful for the clerics who do complete as many aa as posible. The only thing I don't like about DI is that it takes away from the lower tanks in the guild. That only get there shot at glory when the tank line diminishes and they are finally up to bat.<br />
<br />
Give clerics the ability to improve DI more, I agree with the notion it would be wierd to have aa that improves someone else's spell. Although If they gave it to warriors I would likely do it.<br />
<br />
Honestly they should just make warlord's tenacity better. it was a really good idea, but it needs work. I think they should change WT to 750hp/1500hp/2000hp and make the recourse even to the damage it heals. Then I would love the aa. it would be worth spending 30aa so I could blast 2 k HP in when i get low on a raid or in difficult group encounter. It should not be a heal, and should never be an actuall heal, but dividing up damage spikes would be a great tool for a skilled warrior to use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Holywrath</div><div class="date">06-24-2004, 12:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gryzx, unfortunately not all clerics have that AA, and that is neither here nor there.  I do agree that either the spell should be upped, or more AA should be added.<br />
<br />
Fitemore, the game was designed around Complete Heal, period.  I fail to see how it makes the game unbalanced.  And surely you can't be serious about a 10k heal for 2k mana.</div></div><hr />

Just pointing it out so you can take the whip to your clerics to get more aa's! lol</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ariene</div><div class="date">06-24-2004, 05:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bah I love to xp.  The problem is finding some tank to drag around with me.  ;) <br />
<br />
I think 30% is too high - that could be a 4k range on high end tanks.  25% is about as high as I can see it going before it would get annoying - firing when we really don't need it to fire.  The problem with the spell firing too often is the long recast time.  If it fires when you don't need it too often then no one will have it available to recast on you and it might not be up when you do need it.  20% seems a good balance to me.  <br />
<br />
I'd rather see the recipiant get the AA to increase the check range of the spell.  If they gave it to clerics, I'd immediately start working on it. It just makes more sense to me on for the person getting the spell cast on them to have the AA.<br />
<br />
In reguard to DI, what I'd really like for clerics is an AA to reduce the recast time of the spell however I don't know if that would be possible - there are lots of AAs to reduce AA reuse time but as far as I know none to reduce the spell recast time which is built into a spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">06-24-2004, 11:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fitemore, the game was designed around Complete Heal, period.

<br />
  They designed EQ around a level 39 cleric spell, with the max level now at 65. Clerics still constantly use this spell, other than in high end GoD. It was released in original EQ, when people couldn't even dream of maxing out the full (at that time) CH. How can you possibly consider this spell NOT overpowered and unbalancing? Clerics' level 65 fast heal is 3275hp for 750 mana... CH is 7500hp for 400 mana. If you can last 12 seconds, CH is always the choice for heals. Remember CH rotations? These are all seriously bad, bad things. Any single spell they had to design the game around is pretty messed up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dima</div><div class="date">06-25-2004, 12:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Willkomen to EverQuest!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Holywrath</div><div class="date">06-25-2004, 01:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fitemore, you failed to make any valid, or even definitive points.  <br />
<br />
Complete heal used to do just that, completely heal a mob.  Around PoP, it was changed to a base of 7500, and that wasn't too unrealistic because the designers knew tanks were going to have more than that amount of hitpoints.  And whats wrong with a CH chain?  I very seriously doubt that anything in Velious would have been accomplished without it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">06-25-2004, 11:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, actually I did make a point. CH was silly. When it was introduced, it was reasonably mana efficient. As people gained more and more hp, CH got more and more powerful, to the point where it was overpowered. It was never designed to actually heal as many hp as it did; the original healed amount was arbitrary. They nerfed it to 7500hp for 400 mana, which is still what, over twice as efficient as the clerics' best healing spell still? If you can last over 12 seconds (cast time + refresh), CH is the best healing spell in the game. No level 39 spell should still be the most widely used 7 expansions after it was introduced.THAT is what is wrong with CH.<br />
<br />
And whats wrong with a CH chain? <br />
<br />
  Are you kidding me? What is wrong with REQUIRING clerics to cast a spell in a chain like that? I'll tell you what's wrong with that: EVERYTHING. It's completely rediculous. They reduced the cleric role on boss mobs to counting to 3 and clicking a button. A monkey could be a CH rotation cleric. Hell, a monkey could play 2 CH rotation clerics.<br />
<br />
I very seriously doubt that anything in Velious would have been accomplished without it. <br />
<br />
  I agree. That was poor design. Instead of nerfing CH and setting mob damage to something that didn't require chain CH, they planned encounters around it. Look how stupid Luclin mobs got. THO was what, a 30 minute fight with a CH rotation the whole time? The hard part was not falling asleep. <br />
<br />
Obviously SOE agrees with me to some extent on CH, because look at the mob trend: Higher DPS mobs that can often kill you before CH can go off, even in an exp group. Raid mobs that can do the same. Shorter battles so that the mana efficiency of CH is no longer as important. They chose not to nerf CH; instead they are lowering the importance of it.<br />
<br />
  Are these valid and definitive points? If not, start a post in the outhouse, and I'll let you know exactly what a few more points of mine are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">06-29-2004, 10:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">so now that everybody seems calm and peacefull on this threat, I will comment my statement (want to read it ? go in the fisrt post, first quote).<br />
<br />
  History and description (dont red it if you're not a noob) <br />
the cleric tool to help the group in surviving burst and rought attacks is  DI.  <br />
It can be see as a spirit that protect you from death, but because this spirit is very lazy...oups sorry!, ... very busy I mean, it sleeps when your health is OK and wake up when your health is below a certain level (called DI trigering level). When this spirit is wake up, if you gonna die (ie you get hurt for more of your HP) then the spirit disolves itself and give you either 0HP (no heal) or X HP (fixed partial heal) or 20000HP (complete heal, thus you actually stop at your max heal) depending on your luck and your charisma.<br />
Now, clerics have AA to improove it by increasing the proportion of Complete Heal (no AA give something like 23%/12%/65%, and max AA something like 2%/3%/95% and more over it increase the partial heal power, at the end it is a 4500HP heal).<br />
<br />
If we look at us, warrior. we have a skill to protect party members too. it's /shield [target].<br />
it works like this : if we want to protect Healer_01 or Enchanter_01 or Paladin_Noob_10000 we just have to target it and use the /shield command. if this tharget is a PC and is in our group and is not using a discipline and we are not using a discipline and the target is in the radius of effectiveness than we recieve 3/4 of the attack against our taget, while he only recieve 1/2 from it, for a given time.<br />
Now, we can improove it via AA. we can increase the radius of effetc, we can increase the time of effective protection of our taget, and we can decrease the time between two successive use of this ability.<br />
<br />
  What I want <br />
so my point is : DI is a cleric tool not ours, even if it's first use is on the MT.<br />
Thus it's Clerics job to improove it via AA. and seeing that we can be killed in one blow when we are above the DI triger level, it's abvious that it need to be increase (from 15% to say 60% for exemple). But once again it must be improoved via clerics AA, not ours !!!!<br />
if you want an AA to imroove clerics job on you specifically because the have the biggest history of domage recieved ~&gt; healed, then ok but it will be more effective to use it on normal heal rather than DI. it can be called 'Bleeding Mastery' :) and have a related story like 'After years of being screw to death by all the MOB ever created, the Warrior has at last understand the power of being effectively healed and has learned a way to bring all heal casts on them to a greater degree.' and it would increase the healing power of spells cast on us by 1/2/3/4/5%.<br />
<br />
<br />
That's it, not warrior AA to improove DI.<br />
<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gryzx</div><div class="date">06-29-2004, 11:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What would accomplish the same thing (sortof, plus more) would be more mitigation aa's for War's.  You can look at 10% more mitigation as sortof moving that 15% up by 10% (although it does more than help DI).<br />
<br />
So maybe we should vote for more mitigation aa's for wars (although we gotta watchout cuz they may say &quot;Ooooh good Idea let's add 300aa's that let wars get another 30% mitigation and take away defensive&quot;....)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">06-29-2004, 11:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Your idee is very good, even if I need to discuss about it.<br />
<br />
1. a mitigation bonus will help against hard hitting mob BUT it will do nothing agaisnt their 3000DD (-500 resist check).<br />
<br />
2. I like a mitigation AA idee, but to compensate it should not stack with defencive or should get a modification of the formula like (disc_mitig. + inate_mitig.)/2 with defencive mitigation raised to 95% . <br />
Thus w/o AA w/o disc you have 5% mitig. <br />
w/o AA w/ disc you have 50% mitig. <br />
w/ AA w/o disc you have, let's say 5% + 5/10/15 %   mitig. (for a total of 10/15/20%) <br />
and w/ AA and w/ disc you have 52/55/57 %  mitig. <br />
<br />
this would not umbalance too much game but it will help the cause of those asking for more disc immune mob. So I am very mitigated on this proposition :).<br />
<br />
