<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tharak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Absor,   I wanted to highlight one of the main issues that has pretty much all the warriors in an uproar at the moment.  You have claimed that you will have some info for us at the end of the month, not a fix, but some info.  Additionally this is what you have posted for the future plans:<br />

Class Balance <br />
<br />
We're still planning to take a look at improving the damage capabilities of melee classes, as they've fallen behind their magic-using counterparts at the very high end of the game. Finding the proper solutions for this situation will take some time.  Some options being considered are: <br />
<br />
Improve melee damage-increasing disciplines<br />
Improve Planes of Power melee weapons <br />
<br />
Additionally, we're looking at the concerns from players about their spells, and changing them where appropriate.  The goal here is to remove annoying issues with spells, not necessarily to increase caster power overall. <br />

Notice there is no mention of the disparity between knights and warriors.  There is no discussion of the taunt problem that SoE has been aware of for months.  I understand you cannot release details yet on what you are going to do, but you have yet to acknowledge some of our problems either.  From the looks of everything you have posted we can expect that all classes that do most of their damage by swinging a sword (or similar weapon) will get some sort of damage boost.  We may see some more aa's or disciplines that will be offensivly geared (we being all classes who swing a sword etc.).  We can expect a nerf to BoV just becuase it looks like it is contributing to the trivializing of content (not that it is, but from the outside it looks that way).  Beyond that i don;t expect anything to be done, becuase quite simply i have seen no statements that would even reflect that there is a problem.  I see statements like &quot;classes are not that out of balance&quot; but nothing remotly suggesting there is some disparity for the pure melee classes out there.  <br />
     <br />
     A message to the players addressing the problems could go a long way to calming everyone down.  I am not suggesting you need to fill in all the solutions, I am sure we will all have our own theories on those anyhow; however it would be greatly appreciated to at least acknowledge there is some issues and what those issues are.  For all we know SoE has changed the vision of what a warrior should be and now we are going to be a DPS class with armor to survive the aggro we generate.  We also don;t know if you are truely looking at balancing warriors and knights, all we know is that you were looking at balancing melee (including knights) with our magic using brethren.  Heck, we don;t even really know if you have a problem with knights, and monks tanking end game content in Plane of Time.  What really bothers me is you're telling me that you will have answers for us at the end of the month, but seriously are you sure you even know what the questions are??<br />
