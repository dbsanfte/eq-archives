lol I wondered why it took so long to get cross posted here. ignore it, follow it, whatever, im having enough fun on there as it is. Unfortunately I wont be able to answer posts for a few hours, ill be out till about 10:30.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Interesting thought process how because Monks are a pure melee and Warriors are a pure melee that Monks should therefore be superior to Knights in tanking....</div></div><hr />

Say what? Where did I say that monks should be superior to knights in tanking? Just because I think knights tank a little too well doesnt mean I want them brought down to lower than monk status. I dont want to kill them off for crying out loud!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>mishratm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I share your opinion re: knights. If you had a spectrum, with underpowered on the left, overpowered on the right, and balanced taking up 60% of the centre of the spectrum, knights (especially paladins) would be in the area just past balanced and heading to overpowered.<br />
Monks would be left of the centre, but still in the balanced area, and warriors and rogues would be right near the middle. Rangers, they are just cannon fodder, so I don't really care where they fit. :-D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>lokkak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I mostly agree.  At this point it looks like paladins in OOW will be taking less damage than any equal geared warrior, stunning everything up to 70 at level 66, healing as well as a druid at 65, with all the missing nice warrior aa's.<br />
<br />
It is wrong on so many levels to make paladins so strong that it takes defensive to get 10 to 20 percent tanking lead on paladins.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Shh, don't ruin it. I'm thinking strongly of hitting up the KC basement with my Fabled Ghoulbane and Instrument of Nife. Not only can I grab 4 fast levels, but ideally I should get enough AA's for SU/Holyforge. Then it's loot a Cleave bracer, smear the undead LDoNs, and finish up hauling in experiance with a bucket in the tunnel to InkTa'Tu. Seriously, follow the Yellow Brick Road. Special zones are tailored just for your class from level 46 onward. What group won't want a Paladin PLing them?<br />
<br />
The good news is most level 65 Paladins have less than 6000HP's unbuffed. Pbbbt, that's not even competition. So, don't complain - twink instead. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. Paladins are a lot of fun to play, all Warriors and Clerics should make one.<br />
<br />
I can't wait. /ooc 65 not gimp Paladin /lfg!!<br />

Ok what does this title mean?  You promised to rat on him to SW (only interpretation I can see)?  /shrug I'm pretty sure most of us dont care what someone else posts on Monkly Business..</div></div><hr />

Yeah I dont get that either. Someone else decided to post a link to that topic on my server board too. Makes me wonder if they went into my post history and decided to try to &quot;embarass&quot; me on every board I regularly post on. Im surprised they havent posted a link on the druids grove yet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This isn't a grudge. It's not an attempt to embarass Traab. I don't need to attempt anything... he did a fine job of it himself.<br />
<br />
Traab requested it. I said I would. I did. Simple.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">And I'll tell ya someone needs to go jump off a bridge.<br />

any takers? :D<br />

seriously; it's silly man.</div></div><hr />

 Actually, I said I was surprised noone had yet since it was already on my server board. I figured the two FIRST places it would get linked to where the seperate knight boards and tsw.</div></div><hr />

U are kidding right? Not even gonna address this one. If I thought it was true (and I have seen the spell and AA lists) I wouldnt be stripping my 65 paladin with 275AAs as we speak :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Varalla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Hmm.. Only time I get a pally picked over me is for GoD.<br />
And even then hes not tanking, hes just playing stun monkey stunning the mob till its recharmed.<br />
<br />
I dont think Pallys are the superior tank that they used to be, as long as I can hold aggro, Im the better choice. Except for playing  stun monky.<br />
<br />
The sky isnt falling.<br />
Well not yet anyway, who knows what OoW will bring.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No kidding, I guess you have a &quot;grass is greener&quot; problem.  I know what it is like today based on playing a paladin and grouping with a paladin.  I have read the new AA and discs.  This will produce a huge boost to the paladins that isn't copied to warriors.  You can try to deny that fact, but most people will not agree.</div></div><hr />

Ya gotta do what suits ya.<br />
<br />
Paladins have an important place in raids at all levels. Each and every Paladin that shows up is a major contributor.<br />
<br />
My Paladin is level 53 (was 50 when retired shortly after Kunark). Let me tell you - KEI, FT, focus effects, Instument of Nife, my gimp Fabled Ghoulbane, etc are AWESOME. Paladins are the best combination of melee power and a spellbook in the game. I enjoy directing battle like a conductor leading a symphony orchestra<br />
<br />
If you are a Paladin and expect to tank just like a Warrior in high level raids, then you better have some serious meat on your bones. If that's too much for you to handle then you will not be happy.<br />
<br />
Gimmie level 65, 275 AA's, a Hopebringer, Qvic armor, PoTime accessories, all the spells please please. I would have tremendous difficulty logging out even to sleep for months.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Read my first post. Again. The whole way through this time. <br />
<br />
Jebus: YOU POSTED A LINK AND &quot;ENJOY&quot;.  <br />
<br />
 See more of Dobbanz in this thread. <br />
<br />
Enjoy.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dont play the &quot;you didnt read my post crap&quot; game YOU NEVER PROVIDED ANY CONTEXT AT ALL (caps are for increduality not anger).<br />
<br />
As far as &quot;Traab&quot; needing you to post here; odd I see Dobbanz post here all by himself quite often.<br />
<br />
I'm calling BS. This is a troll.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Archonfire</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Of course it's a troll, Flair.<br />
<br />
I think you've missed who I was trying to troll though.<br />
<br />
As to not putting any context into my post... which one? TSW? I didn't need to, the link is right there. And why would I put context when the post was created solely for one person, who I can assume read the origin for this thread in the first place?<br />
<br />
EDIT: Ahahahahahahahha! I see now! You thought when I said my first post, I meant the first post in this thread.<br />
<br />
My bad, my first post refers to my first post in the thread I linked.<br />
<br />
Now, here's the kicker: the reason you misunderstood what I said is because the post you quoted first (Read my post. Again. All the way through) was aimed specifically at Traab  (n o t  y o u  o k ?), and therefore assumed that he would know what I was talking about.<br />
<br />
Which he did, btw.</div></div><hr />
