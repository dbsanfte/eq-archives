<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eaphin</div><div class="date">05-05-2003, 11:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1. Is there any cultural armor for Iksar that is decent? Is the Skyiron or whatever all there is? <br />
<br />
2. How many pike's are there? Are the quests worth doing? On Alla's quest page the latest one I saw was the level 25 quest. Is the final pike decent enough? <br />
<br />
Thanks all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
2. The pikes are for show. I think that's about all you need to know. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donnel</div><div class="date">06-19-2003, 02:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can't remember where the post was, but there was some info on the Pike's Elsewhere (if I remember I will edit)<br />
<br />
Apparently, they get okay, but the last one(s) are still not found apparently.<br />
<br />
Edit: Found it faster then I thought. Look here for a little info: http://steelwarrior.xwarzone.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=1173</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dumptimax</div><div class="date">06-19-2003, 03:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The iksar warrior pike quests were never finished and arent all implemented. they just recently got the necro skullcaps finally up to number 8 (should still be more at least 10 to consider it complete/on par witrh monk/sham).  And considering theres about 5 iksar warriors per server (sic) don't expect this to get implemented anytime soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donnel</div><div class="date">06-19-2003, 03:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you check out this magelo I set up real quick...<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=721636<br />
<br />
The Legionare's Pike is the last item that Magelo has in it's database (Item 5135) Before it gets to the Cudgel (5140) which is for Shaman though it is not the Shaman &quot;weapon&quot; quest. <br />
<br />
Now, one could assume from this that there may likely be a pike at numbers 5136, 5137, 5138, and 5139... that no one has found yet.<br />
<br />
Happy hunting. If you look at the other post I had and then follow the link IN that post to the sight for unfinished quests, you can join the search.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Karlea</div><div class="date">06-20-2003, 01:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As for the pikes, there are 4 more Iksar warrior pikes and their data can already be found in the game files. I was able to look up their stats and I must say that the last one &quot;Overlord's Mancatcher&quot; was a very decent piece. I think it was 25/35, several nice stats and a Stun proc. Mainhand only unfortunately.<br />
<br />
The problem is that the quests to get those 4 last pikes aren't in game, the pikes already are. :(<br />
<br />
I'll look around for the link to where I read about them.</div></div><hr />
