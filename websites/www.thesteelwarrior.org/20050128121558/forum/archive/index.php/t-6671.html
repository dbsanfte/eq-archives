Above is a link to my alt warrior Im in a guild with many high level people and we raid when we can but getting a good  core of   quality tanks on at the same time is tough. I currently have a other high level toons (65&amp; many aa's). It's possibile for me to put groups together for camping  drops for the little punk but specifically once I get him to 65  and grind some aa's I want him to be able to tank TT GRUM MB ect. <br />
<br />
Heres the help I need. First are my weapons good enough if not make some suggestions. Needs to be non raid targets for camping. Second Besides my back which is gonna be the loyalist sheild  as soon as I finish the last camp. What gear could I Camp/buy. And Finally I'm Gonna pump out a quick 50 aa once he gets to level 65 ...If you tanks only had 50 aa to be the main tank for the raids I listed above  what would they be.<br />

Im shooting for 1500ac +5500hp  unbuffed more is better please help.<br />

Getting 1500ac unbuffed without raid loot or a LOT of LDoN points is another story. I have over 5800hp, but only about 1350ac.<br />

For AA: General- run3, other3 (regen, sta, metabalism, cha all have their proponents)  cost and total 6. Grats on Baron.  Archtype- ND3 cost12, total 18. Grats on Veteran.  Class- AETaunt cost 5 total 23.  Back to archtype- CA3 cost 12, total 35, then CS3 cost 12 total 47. Back to class- PE cost 5, total 52 or PoP - PD1 cost 3, total 50.  PD will give more hp than PE, but PE also adds to your avoidance and mitigation. Note that's not what I did, but I didn't have any intention of being a raid tank until I suddenly was one.</div></div><hr />

I do have quite a few VT pieces with a lot of direct hp, instead of ac. So that may contribute to it. I</div></div><hr />

As far as aggro goes, the weapons you've got should do as well as the now-standard Copper Hammer of Striking / Sword of the Bloodsworn combo, both procs have the desired stun component and the DPS should be very nearly as good.  Your dual weild setup will last you well, and if it were my plat, I wouldn't spend it on the switch.  You may want to pick up a Greatstaff of Thunder (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=24799) for 2 handed aggro, it's a very good weapon with long legs on it.  Decent DPS too.</div></div><hr />
