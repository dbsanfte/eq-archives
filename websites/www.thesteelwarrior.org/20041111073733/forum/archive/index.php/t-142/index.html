<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mightyberge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i am going to be doing the the punishing blade route with 2hs but was wondering. what is best ratio type of 2hs sword to get. im not talking a particuler  one, that would be blade of war,etc.  I am talking on damage/delay princples only. <br />
<br />
what i mean is i noticed alot of the upper tier planes have  2hs stats of mid 30 to mid40 damage and delay's below 40 on several of the weapons. but we don't get the damage bonus till after 42 delay. so, which  is better. if anyone can offer insight it would be great. thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Varaho</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">we don't get the damage bonus till after 42 delay <br />
<br />
False.<br />
<br />
<br />
We get a damage bonus with every weapon we can use.<br />
<br />
It is only with dly of less than 28 that things get messed up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>arative</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm using stone etched war sword has 45dmg/30dly 2hs<br />
I would get punishing blade regardless, its well worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Even the sub 28 delay weapons are still pretty good assuming you've a good amount of worn attack.  People tend to forget that your offhand weapon doesn't even always swing, and that damage bonus is but a small fraction of the damage you actually deal out (or at least it should be...)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Robok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">What 2 hander you want basicly depends on what your doing with it.<br />
If your going to be tanking with it, I'd personaly stick to the faster, low delay weapons preferably with a decent taunt proc.<br />
If your going to be mainly useing it for dps.. your probably better off with a higher dmg weapon (witch normaly means slower) as it draws less aggro and lets you take advantage of the higher bonus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mokor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">anything with a ratio of damage/delay greater or equal to 1 sould be good. anything over .8 will keep your dps over most dualweild<br />
<br />
the formula i use(not tested or anything just numbers to help make a choice)<br />
<br />
(main hand damage+bonus/ delay)+(secondary damage+delay)/2<br />
if the 2hander i'm looking at damage+bonus/delay is not dubble or greater i pass on it. fi your tripple attack is not relible yet leave the bonus off the 2h equation. damage/delay not all 2h&gt;dw just the good stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">At the high end stage speed matters very little to aggro.  VI isn't going to design a 1/2 weapon.  From personal testing, Ornate Greatblade does not hold aggro well at all despite being a blazing fast 2H (35/23).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>BrikBludgaard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The Ornate Greatsword has issues with damage as well.<br />
<br />
Even with 1500-1600ATK the OG parses LESS than the the 28 20 (+3 magic) 1HB weapon I use on most mobs.  (In the hands of a Shadowknight of course.)<br />
<br />
The OG is humiliated (about 5-7% LESS DPS) by the 60th level weapon Goldenrod....  and thats only if we count the OG's proc working full time.<br />
<br />
ATK does lessen the effect of a lack of a damage bonus....<br />
If the ratio on the OG were better, then yes, it would compete against other 2H PoP weapons like the BoW and the SEWS...<br />
<br />
but the truth is, the OG is not really where it should be.<br />
The OG has 170HP on it...  and thus we could say its supposed to be somewhere in the 185HP SEWS league....  perhaps not quite as good, but certainly better than the 125HP Ssra weaponry.<br />
The OG's proc is a curse...  making it a specialty weapon you can only use sometimes...  the OG cannot outdamage Ssra weaponry, and is outdamaged by similar difficulty Knight 1H drops. (without PoP 2H AAXP of course)<br />
<br />
They really need to fix the &lt;28 delay thing....<br />
<br />
lower delays should have lower bonuses... but this whole falloff to 14 thing at 27 delay makes many of the very nice PoP weapons into 1DKP booby prizes.<br />
<br />
Change delays below 28 to fall off rapidly...  but not NEARLY the immediate dropoff to 14 at 27 please.<br />
<br />
28 delay is 35 bonus<br />
27 should be 33<br />
26 should be 32<br />
25 should be 30<br />
24 should be 29<br />
23 should be 27<br />
22 should be 26<br />
21 should be 24<br />
20 should be 23<br />
<br />
Note the OG's max damage only increases by about 6-7DPS... and puts it in the league of at least Srra weapons in average damage output.<br />
<br />
<br />
There are many other weapons that gain from fixing the silly 27 delay 2H dropoff...  more variety is good...  every serious high end player wielding BoW or SEWS is kinda lame.<br />
<br />
Such a waste of good artwork too...  I like the OG's model very much.  its really too bad that every player who is eligible to get one, has a noticeably better weapon in their backpack from the expansion before.<br />
<br />
I really wish I was wrong here...  I wish the OG had some place where its a worthy weapon... but I now have numerous parses in which it fails to compete with Ssra weaponry.  it didn't even have to win really...  just compete... <br />
<br />
If anyone has some good news on the OG, I'd love to hear it.<br />
<br />
maybe if I get 1700 or 1800 ATK??<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ornate Greatblade has about 12 DPS due to damage bonus, assuming 100% chance to double attack and 50% chance to hit.  People have parsed 150 DPS with Ornate Greatblade so this for sake of simplification let's call this 10 DPS on damage bonus and 140 DPS on ratio.   Extrapolate this to the 40/32 Goldenrod you'd get 116 DPS on ratio, and 23 DPS from damage bonus, so that puts it at just about 140 DPS, plus whatever you get from procs.<br />
<br />
Even if you treat Goldenrod like a 43/32, as long as you do at least 106 DPS you'll break even and OG will do better the more attack you have from that point on.  This is ignoring the proc since I don't know how much DPS that is.<br />
<br />
I know warriors with similar attack with BoW parse 150+ DPS easily.  Unless OG also hits for a lower spectrum, the only thing OG loses to BoW is about 12 DPS difference in damage bonus (and actually you make up 4 DPS from the dot).  142 DPS is good enough for me for a weapon that's off a mob that's always up.<br />
<br />
As for the dot on the OG, it just forces you to pay attention to the target you get when you assist someone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Solinar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">167 DPS against Jiva the other night with OG.<br />
<br />
That was with /disc Agressive and no avatar or SoT, my attack was like 1516.<br />
<br />
I regularly &quot;average&quot; 130 DPS with avatar procced and both ranger atk buffs when my atk is in the 1800 range.<br />
<br />
Ornate Greatblade is just fine the way it is.  Damage bonus just isnt that important once you crank your ATK up.  It drops off the gimpiest mini in all the elemental planes and drops like 75% of the time.  Its right where it should be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ladas Sindarin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">That change to the Damag Bonus tables you proposed Brik would give the Crowfooted Lance from my last set of parses a 10 DPS increase, from 152.73 to 162.57, over 37 fights averaging 43 seconds each (25:54 total time) fighting level 65 PoFire mobs.  That is a pretty hefty jump for a weapon that is roughly equal to the OGS you are ranting about (Crowfooted = 32/20 and OGS = 35/23).<br />
<br />
What I do find really curious is the claim that the OGS doesn't even beat Knight weapons from Ssra (ie Goldenrod), yet those same weapons (CFL and OGS) outdamage any DW combo from Ssra or POP (possible exception of the new PoE 1H mace, which I havent seen any parses from yet).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I have to agree with Hanadan about the OG, you cant expect too much from a sword that drops nearly every time from a mob thats a day and a half spawn. I wouldnt expect an annoyingly common, frequently dropped sword like this to be an aggro monster or dps king. Its a decent 2hander, but wont win any awards, and it shouldnt, its in a perfect little niche already.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Grimmlokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I view OG like I view Sparkling Shortsword. Good enough to fill in needed slot on people but don't expect any revelations.<br />
<br />
 As for the original question, what's the best ratio for 2HS. Umm, 99999999dmg 1dly. It's not real an answerable question=P As it stands BoW is the best dmg 2H there is, at 48/32. SEWS is a close second 45/30. And frankly I imagine SEWS holds agro just as good as BoW, if not better.<br />
<br />
http://lucy.fnord.net/dmgbonus.html<br />
<br />
 There's a listong of DB's by level/dly. Ideally you want the highest DB in relation to delay to get the most out of the damage bonus. So 28 is the &quot;best&quot; delay. DB does not scale up appropriately on high delay 2H's. Something like the Plankton Laced Greatsword(65delay) should have 75+db. But it's 63. Not really on topic, just an observation.<br />
<br />
 Can ask monks about 28dly weapons. REBB at 42/28 rips stuff up. I think one of our monks parsed out over 200dps on one of the bosses in PoAir the other night.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The difference between the damage you get out of damage bonus on a 28 delay weapon like REBB versus say 32 delay weapon like BoW is something on the order of 2 DPS.  I don't know the details of the damage table monk gets but I think they have the same max hit as we do, so that means their damage table is less useful with higher attack ratings (since we're all hitting closer to max, which is the same).  <br />
<br />
Warriors in my guild with BoW claim to have parsed 200 DPS with attack buffs as well so REBB doing 200 DPS isn't exactly that impressive considering the it's supposed to be 1/1.2/1.4 on the damage spectrum between war/monk/rogue.  I guess you can say it's payback for Luclin when it looked more like 1/2/3.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Thorbadin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I've been using an ornate greatblade mostly for a few months.<br />
<br />
I also believe now that with a good enough attack, combined with the low ac of pop mob, the low dmg bonus is not a &quot;problem&quot;.  Obviously it does factor in the equation.  But at a 1.52 ratio and a +4dps proc I think the weapon old it's own pretty well.<br />
<br />
It should give inferior results to Blade of War or Stone Etched Warsword, but this is expected.  Is it better then old luclin weaponry?  I agree that on paper goldenrod is pretty close in damage, advantage going to ornate only when you hit close to your max all the time.<br />
<br />
Probably the #1 argument for that weapon is how common it is.  We have 0 goldenrod in guild and we have killed cursed I don't know, 20-30 times?  But we can get ornate greatswords at will.<br />
<br />
The 2nd point is general 1-hander vs 2-handers.  I still see alot of warrior and rangers in my guild using 1-hander combo that are certainly inferior in dps to what a OG would put out.  Except for the dot, which doesn't really matter anyway, the main argument I always see against this weapon is the damage bonus and it's kinda pissing me off.  It's obvious they had the low bonus in mind when they put a 1.52 ratio on this easy to get weapon, cause otherwise it would outdmg everything else.<br />
<br />
As a side note, I'm attaching an excel file I use to calculate dps &quot;on paper&quot;.  Some of the numbers are probably wrong, and I would like your feedback on it, just post somewhere or send me a private message with ways I should improve it (like more accurate number for DW, DA, tripple attack, etc).

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>BrikBludgaard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Note,<br />
<br />
my findings are that the knight weapons from Ssra outdamage the OG in the hands of a knight...<br />
<br />
You say OG outdamages all dual wield combos in the hands of a warrior.<br />
<br />
While I actually agree that dual wield has taken one too many indirect nerfs (no PoP AA's affect it, no offhand damage bonus post 60, poor itemization), The Goldenrod cannot be compared in any way with dual wield combos as knights cannot dual wield, and warriors cannot use Goldenrod.<br />
<br />
Parsed DPS is really the only comparison right now...<br />
<br />
and I am nowhere near 150DPS with the Goldenrod even counting its procs... (and fully hasted, buffed, ranger ATK buffs, etc.)<br />
<br />
Knights lower skill caps result in missing more against dark blue mobs or higher, and result in hitting less hard (less innate ATK).<br />
<br />
here's a copy/paste from one of the parses I was quoting:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I was in PoV in a pickup group.<br />
ATK was just over 1500 with a ranger in the group. (torrent too)<br />
Each weapon was parsed for an hour of pulls.<br />
The group didn't change much the whole time.<br />
(we swapped out a warrior for a warrior)<br />
I was NOT pulling.<br />
I was casting fastcast DD/lifetap spells and Torrent of Hate as the party wanted it and I didnt have the room for Aura of Hate.<br />
Mobs included the golems, spiders and crawlers in the wastes, with an occasional named (who arent really that much more difficult)<br />
We had many pulls due to not having much competition.<br />
I had Full haste.<br />
I do NOT have any of the SotK or KA due to my current primary weapon being Heavy Bludgeoner.<br />
<br />
I was honestly trying to find a use for the OG, hoping it would be better under the right circumstances...  I just wanted it to compete really as I like the look of the OG, and I just like 2H weapons...<br />
<br />
<br />
Goldenrod: 107DPS (100%)<br />
Greatstaff of Misery 102DPS (95%)<br />
Heavy Bludgeoner 99DPS (92-93%)<br />
Ornate Greatsword 97DPS (90-91%)*assuming proc is always active*<br />
Lance of the Flame Knight 91DPS (85%)<br />
<br />
This is counting procs, and accounting for the difference between SLAM and BASH.  I had to estimate the DoT damage on the OG, figure if its working the whole time, all the time, its doing 24/tick or 4DPS.  This was included in the calculations above. (thus the OG was only doing 93DPS in melee damage, counting SLAM<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
That was with 1500ATK consistent...<br />
I can get up to 1600ish briefly using Aura of Hate.<br />
<br />
Later parses with 1600ATK do NOT seem to close the gap...<br />
<br />
<br />
What level of ATK was used in those parses at 150+ DPS with the OG?  I am assuming a (maxed) level 65 warrior.  1700ATK?  1800?  2000?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I do not really find the SEWS to be much harder to get than the OG...  the ring that drops the SEWS is not far at all from the EarthA zone, and really isnt that hard once you do it once.  The general actually kills more people than the Mud ring due to some people not understanding the words: if you aggro, feign, camp, or die... DO NOT TRAIN!  True enough the ring resets less often, but the mud guy drops two loots while the General was only dropping one. (we don't bother with him any more due to his worthless drops, so this might have changed) The SEWS drops rather often as well...<br />
<br />
I'd say the SEWS is designed to be better... but not that much.  the SEWS has 185HP on it, and the OG has 170...  one would think they should be in the same league, even if the OG is supposed to be slightly lesser.<br />
<br />
<br />
In the long run.. its not gonna matter...  I'll be swinging a SEWS like everyone else.<br />
<br />
I just wish there were a few more competitive choices.<br />
<br />
I wish that the combat engine made sense, and frankly would like them to start stamping out the silly stuff.<br />
The 2H damage bonus was designed to give 2H weapons an advantage... that advantage is supposed to be consistency...  now 2H weapons are outdamaging dual wield (incorrectly) and not being consistent.<br />
It boggles the mind sometimes.<br />
<br />
<br />
Perhaps the OG was designed for warriors and rangers... I have a nagging feeling that was not the case, but a product of forgetting an old policy.<br />
<br />
<br />
oh well.<br />

<br />
Unless a high damage bonus somehow makes the weapon more likely to hit on the upper spectrum of possible damage, OG only loses about 12 DPS to the best damage bonus weapon (28 delay) in the field of damage bonus, which is nothing when you consider the weapon can do 150 DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">On the SK parse, your number actually confirms the numbers I have been calculating.  I treated Goldenrod as a 43/32 weapon and ignored the proc and got that you've to do at least 106 DPS to break even (OG and Goldenrod would both do 106 DPS).  Since I ignored the proc, the break even point is actually a little bit higher, and your DPS number is consistent with that result.<br />
<br />
I'd guess 120 DPS is probably where OG starts outperforming Goldenrod based on your parses.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, Im assuming your post was a reply to mine, but I'm a Ranger, not a warrior.  And my attempt wasn't to compare Golden Rod and Dual Weild.  I just found it curious that the top weapon for Knights from the previous expansion continues to dominate the DPS charts for those classes that can use, while the same level of DW options from that expansion (and this one so far) pale in comparisonn to the DPS of 2H weapons that are lesser in the hands in the hands of knights.  To me, it points to a serious problem with itemization of 1H weapons.<br />

Parsed DPS is really the only comparison right now...<br />

If you hold a Frostreaver, you'll be very hard pressed to find a 2hander or dual wield combo,  that is better aggrowise (I'm told Gauldarek from NtoV might be an upgrade to it, but since I don't own a Gauldarek I cannot comment)<br />
<br />
For pure DPS the wingblade or twisted steel bastardsword I'd say.</div></div><hr />

In my hands, the weapon is actually worse than the weapons I already wield from the last expansion.<br />
<br />
Should I receive such a weapon as you suggested, I would have 1) done the math to estimate its output, and 2) parsed it.  We both know I would have found the 50 10 -5 weapon to own anythign that exists.  (likely tripling the maximum damage output, and doubling average damage output)<br />
<br />
Your &quot;feeling&quot; about &quot;people would say &lt;any low delay weapons&gt; suck&quot; is baseless, at least in my case...  Even someone with 1100ATK would see that particular blade own everything.<br />
<br />
Damage bonus affects average damage by upping minimum damage.  Ratio and speed are of course bigger players, but it is the overall weapon that should be considered and parses that should be the final determining tool.<br />
<br />
I did the parses, I did the math...  the result is a weapon that should be much better than it is.<br />
<br />
Losing 12DPS when you deal 109DPS total is a bigger deal than when you deal 150DPS.<br />
<br />
12DPS = 11% of 109<br />
12DPS = 8% of 150<br />
<br />
I'd say an 11% damage drop is worth being annoyed over... especially after the numerous flags and timesinks to get to the PoF...  the encounter that drops the Goldenrod is trivial at 65.  I gained 5 levels and spent numerous hours colecting planar flags andkilling gods... for a weapon that is inferior to the stuff I already carry in my backpack.<br />
<br />
<br />
Since I was at 1500ATK for the parse in question, and 1600 did not even close the gap, then it is not unreasonable I am going to have to achieve 1700-1800 or more ATK (an accomplishment for a Knight) to even have a shot at allowing the OG to be AS GOOD as a weapon that is designed for level 60 characters.<br />
<br />
<br />
Must be nice being a warrior or Ranger... and being able to be MUCH less picky about which weapon you use for damage dealing.  Grats you.<br />
<br />
Perhaps this is WHY weapons such as Goldenrod exist.<br />
<br />
I would REALLY love to find the OG a better weapon.  Its just not happening.<br />
<br />
We STILL have two weapons in the game that are so much superior to every other one that no one bothers to use anything else if they manage to get their hands on them.  Note, I am making my decision based upon parses...  not just what it &quot;looks&quot; like.  It won't be surprising when everyone else does too.<br />
<br />
Variety would be cool thanks...<br />
<br />
God forbid warriors do an extra 10-12 DPS with the Lance...  because a &quot;master of weapons&quot; shouldn't deal any real damage with a weapon found on the greater elemental planes...<br />

P.S.<br />
Phan, your estimations are horrendously overlooking spell damage and overall utility.<br />
a 500pt dot in 2 minutes does about 250 real damage if it procs on the first swing in most XP groups. (its worse in raids as the mob pretty much insta-dies)  If the Goldenrod procs ONCE, it has already made a 300point differential.  The goldenrod's proc rate is oh so much more than 1/min.  It is true that the OG has better stats, but frankly, the stats are not gonna make up for it being a lesser damage dealer and proc that is more of a curse than a help.<br />
<br />
P.P.S.<br />
<br />
Yup, I wholeheartedly agree that dual wield needs a looksee.<br />
Dual wield, 1H + Shield, and 2H should all be viable.<br />
<br />
Should be: (yes I know its not)<br />
Dual wield = most damage, most risk<br />
2H = consistent damage dealing, lesser risk.<br />
1H + shield = most defensive, (and actually does something)<br />
<br />
God forbid that a number of viable combinations of weapons and weaponstyles would exist!</div></div><hr />
