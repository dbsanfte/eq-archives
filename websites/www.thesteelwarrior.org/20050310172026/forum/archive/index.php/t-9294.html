<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frodlin7th</div><div class="date">10-07-2004, 08:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi guys,<br />
<br />
It's time to revisit the warrior &quot;Top Ten&quot; list.   This should be reviewed from time to time so that it no longer stales, but there's been some changes that have been made to the game which necessitates a total review.   I'll list the current &quot;top ten&quot; list which was formulated in GoD, and ask that we review the items, to determine if some are old and need tossage and replacement considering all that's changed in OOW.<br />
<br />
The current &quot;Top Ten&quot; list:<br />
<br />
1.      Taunt.   Success rate, particularly the steep decline vs. Yellow/Red mobs, is too low and too unreliable (currently being evaluated), taunting when OOR causes taunt button to grey out (fix for this should be going on Test in mid-October)<br />
<br />
Update:  Moved to top of list.    This is currently the most pressing issue with the warrior community.   There is no other skill which has such a lousy scaling of the success rate based on mob level as taunt.   <br />
<br />
2.      Re-Evaluate Epic 1.5/2.0 Effect (New)<br />
<br />
Details and a discussion to follow.<br />
<br />
3.     Endurance Regen:   We need endurance regen from Spells and/or items.   Modrods should provide an endurance benefit equal to the mana benefit.  Also, change + Endurance only augments to +Endurance regen.   (currently being evaluated)<br />
4.      reimplement the ability to /disc to see the refresh timer on discs (currently being evaluated)<br />
<br />
5.      Re-Evaluate warrior disciplines.   (New)<br />
<br />
There's a few issues:   <br />
<br />
A. Endurance costs on all of the new discs is WAY too high<br />
<br />
B. Aura of Runes negates the use of inherent proc right clicks.   Please consider &quot;suspending&quot; them rather than dispelling them completely.<br />
<br />
C. The level 70 discipline needs to be effective against even con and higher mobs.   If it's not reasonable to make level 70+ mobs stunnable (and it's probably not reasonable), then change the effect to a dramatic defensive based damage shield (DD) effect, or a &quot;defensive&quot; hate inducing proc, or something along those lines.   As it currently stands, there's not a whole lot of use for the discipline which SHOULD be our best.   <br />
<br />
D. Savage onslaught needs a longer timer or shorter refresh and a MUCH lower endurance upkeep.<br />
<br />
 <br />
6.      Increase the effectiveness of duel wielding weapons (currently being evaluated)<br />
 <br />
7.      Add a shield disc or shield usefulness (no change planned at this time) [possibly addressed in Omens - partially anyway]<br />
The following are helpful suggestions as to what can be adjusted to shields to make them something desired.   Above all, when it comes to shields, we want the option to use them for a noticeable benefit.  <br />
 <br />
Adjust the effect of Furious Bash, to make it either a standard proc, or a percentage hate modifier.   The concept isn't to make shields as good at aggro as dual wielding or using a 2 hand weapon, but to make them a viable option with some tangible benefit.<br />
 <br />
Add Shielding or block to shields<br />
 <br />
Warrior shields result in a larger DPS decrease than knight shields do based on the nature of knight weapons vs. warrior weapons.    A warrior equipped shield should add a +damage modifier to his/her main hand weapon so that when using a shield, the DPS balance continues to exist.<br />
 <br />
Shields equippable by tanks should exceed dramatically the stats gained with an offhand weapon.   30AC and 50hp arent' enough benefit to the loss of aggro and damage that occurs when a shield is equipped<br />
 <br />
UPDATE:  The real issues at this time is aggro generation comparatively with other classes who have this AA ability, who have taken dramatic strides toward tanking parity with us due to Omens launch and content,  we take a much larger hit in aggro generation than others, as well as the availability of good main hand only weapons to make the shield AA useful  for those without BBoB/Darkblade/Fleshbiter<br />
 <br />
8.      Improve stun from kick/slam (currently being evaluated)<br />
 <br />
Update:  Please advise the newest maximum stun level for kick/bash<br />
 <br />
 <br />
9.     Melee Focus Effects:   The current level of melee foci are too limited.   There are no mage summonned melee foci, and melee foci were not retroactively placed on older gear.   The current list of foci is also too limited in what it acheives when compared with caster foci.   (currently being evaluated)<br />
 <br />
10.      balance bash damage to the weapon (currently being evaluated)<br />
 <br />
Note: This is likely to be merged with the shield issue next update<br />
<br />
<br />
Much has changed over the last few weeks, thus it's time to review and redo.<br />
<br />
My personal suggested issues would be:<br />
<br />
- Shocking Defense:  Either make the effect work on level 70+ mobs or give a different effect that does work on them.<br />
<br />
- Endurance costs of OOW discs/Bazu Bellow.    <br />
<br />
Throw out some more, and let's see if we cant' whip this list into shape.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bardeil</div><div class="date">10-07-2004, 10:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like your suggestions frodlin, and the list in general seems solid..<br />
<br />
One thing I think we should consider is some variety of improved offensive capability. The current offensive discs have VERY long timers, and eat a ton of endurance. They're all but useless in a single group situation, and don't add much to a raid either. I'm not sure exactly what rog/monk discs look like, but they seem to have a fair number of things they can activate on a regular basis to significantly boost their dps.<br />
<br />
Given that we're just as much 1-trick ponies as they are, I'm not sure why we shouldn't be almost on par with them offensively, at least when not tanking. I'm really tired of hearing &quot;warriors can't do dps&quot;.<br />
<br />
The whole knight 1-hander thing is pretty lame too, IMO, but I don't really know what the solution to that is other than nerfing 2+ year old weapons. They're supposed to use 2-handers to get decent DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">10-07-2004, 10:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">- Shocking Defense: OK<br />
- Endurance costs of OOW discs/Bazu Bellow.  OK<br />
- the shield issues can be reshaped into less points and partially remove (we have some new shield AA) .<br />
- epic reevaluation : OK<br />
- melee focii : need greatly to be improved. in their current state dodge/parry mod don't decrease mob's DPS, but just transform miss into more dodge/parry. I assume that fero works alike (more doubles, less triples or something like that).<br />
- taunt : OK<br />
- disc : OoW disc's are all less than situational, the only good points is their separation on height timers.<br />
- we have AA to get a DB in offhand but it isn't count in the hate formula. it should be corrected. (same for bash/Slam/kick and does their stun compenent generate aggro as much as a spell or what?) : we need more and more aggro to face 500+DPS<br />
- add more lvl70 content (revamp old zones).<br />
- endurence regen : OK<br />
- add so possible AC in the new tradeskill augment (we can have HP + something, end/mana + something, stats + something, resists + something but can't have AC + something). the only buyable AC aug are the 10AC from LDoN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ocide</div><div class="date">10-07-2004, 10:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">shocking defense does work on lvl 70+ mobs, at least it did when i was exping in riftseekers. i'd use it when we pulled 2 *didn't have a chanter* it barely worked but i did notice a stun on them. i do believe they are lvl 72. upping the stun lvl won't make it anymore useful.  unless you want it to stun raid mobs? which are alrdy immune. so dunno!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">10-07-2004, 12:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">6. Increase the effectiveness of duel wielding weapons (currently being evaluated)<br />
<br />
Seems to me that Dual wield is preferable to 2-hand in almost every situation now.   Why does it still need to be made more effective?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bardeil</div><div class="date">10-07-2004, 12:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Seems to me that Dual wield is preferable to 2-hand in almost every situation now. Why does it still need to be made more effective?<br />
<br />
<br />
My interpretation is that it plays into the fact that our 1-handers suck compared to classes that don't get dual wield (aka knights), basically playing into my complaint about dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bigrin Da Troll</div><div class="date">10-08-2004, 03:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1.  Assuming that stun aggro scales with mob level/HP such that Ykesha augs become superior to Anger III on level 70+ mobs (as discussed in another thread), FIX IT.  Either change the way stun aggro scales, cap the hate from stuns significantly below the 600 raw hate of Anger III, or add Anger IV augs so that Warriors once again have something (WAR only) superior to Ykesha augs for aggro generation.<br />
<br />
2.  Given the proliferation of RANGE slot items vastly superior to even the best bows in stats, and that 'Press the Attack' was (quote) never intended to be a pulling tool (end quote), give us an improved 'Throw Stone' discipline, on the same timer as Throw Stone (ie independant from the other current discs) with a significant range (at least 200, preferably 400), fixed 1 damage, 10 second reuse, to be used as a pulling tool.<br />
<br />
3.  Tradeskill-created AC augments, preferably Warrior only, with more than 10 AC.  (As an extra-special request, make them a Troll cultural smithing product.  #:-])</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">10-08-2004, 04:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1. only less than 10 poeple claims that stuns scale with HP. it's not a proof to me, for the moment it's just a hypothesis. nevertheless, there is no procing aug outside LDoN : what about creating new drop table with some improved procing aug in OoW.<br />
2. 'thow stones' is on the same timer than incite, if we want a pulling tool it must be separated from incite otherwise we can't chain the pull with incite.<br />
3. As my previous post, I agree.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lakor</div><div class="date">10-08-2004, 05:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would love if they changed the epic look to something better, heh.<br />
<br />
Other than that, solid list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GraniteMG</div><div class="date">10-08-2004, 05:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm one of those warriors that made the switch from Anger3 augs to Yak augs, I've noticed no aggro loss whatsoever, hard to tell if there's been a gain or not and i'm not going to eyeball it. Assuming Yak does scale with level, and looking at the fact that dev's havent entered item with pure hate procs in quite some time it seems both karma and the dev's are trying to ween us off the DPS loss of pure hate procs.<br />
<br />
That said, I think a good solution would be to make Anger (Not Anger 3, Anger) a purchasable augment proc from LDoN for 1492. I've put it as my Number 3. With hards so much easier it wouldn't even be that difficult to grind out the points from scratch, let alone after trade in of the old augs.<br />
<br />
My list would be:<br />
<br />
1. Insane Endurance Cost of OoW Disciplines, and their sub-par effects.<br />
2. Epic Focus Blows (effect I can live with, especially the 15% resistance rate)<br />
3. Add an Anger Augment purchasable for 1492<br />
4. Taunt<br />
5. Lack of AC Augments in OoW crafting. 4/8/12 would be fine, just preferrable over HP augs.<br />
6. Fix our epic so it doesn't look &quot;plastic&quot; don't even have to rework the model really, just fix the texture. Looks exactly like my old he-man toy from childhood.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slassh</div><div class="date">10-08-2004, 06:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Whats wrong with taunt? Works pretty well in my opinoin.<br />
<br />
My list would be:<br />
<br />
Introduce more viable tradeskill quests for augments (MORE BIC)<br />
<br />
Add a Anger Augment quest<br />
<br />
Shields seem to be fine. Many benefits using shields, but the typical warrior has ass AC and subsequently doesnt gain the main benefit of increasing the effective softcap. Who really cares about DPS when your using a shield since shields are for mitigation, not DPS.<br />
<br />
I am not a large fan of the GoD discs...<br />
<br />
I would leave epic1.5 alone but would ensure that epic2.0 isnt just a slighly boosted 1.5. Maybe have some specific sub quests for 1.5 and 2.0 tht yield different augs that can only be equiped in those weapons?<br />
<br />
Is this a &quot;I want list&quot; or is it &quot;This is unbalanced or illogical list&quot;. because if its the former, then I would like a lot more ac and hps on all my items!!<br />
<br />
Lets just hope epic2.0 reflects the expected trouble to get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abynormal777</div><div class="date">10-08-2004, 09:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If the stun agro hypothesis is correct, something needs to be on the list to;  (1) cap stun hate, (2) give more hate for anger augs, (3) refund points for anger augs, or (4) something I'm not thinking of to make the situation more equal.<br />
<br />
I definitely agree with Taunt being on the list.  It's incredibly frustrating to get 6 or 7 failed taunts in a row when fighting harder mobs (since taunts success rate depends on the mobs level relative to mine.)  I wouldn't mind if this happened every now and then, but to have it happen as often as it does (sorry, no stats to quote...just casual observations) is irritating for me any my group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Moruk</div><div class="date">10-08-2004, 10:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">- add AC augs just like there are augs for every other stat.  Either &gt;10ac and still restricted to the same ldon slots, or decrease slot restrictions.<br />
<br />
- maybe i misunderstood the threads about the augs that have Improved Dodge 3 etc, it sure sounds like they are next to useless.  My first impression of ID3 would be that it should reduce mob dps against me, not just fiddle with turning misses into dodges, etc.  could be completely wrong on this but some dev explanations seem in order.<br />
<br />
- explanation for what good a +8% dodge aug is to a level 70 warrior with maxed dodge skill.  According to sony's own web site, it would only improve your dodge skill if you were not capped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frodlin7th</div><div class="date">10-08-2004, 06:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This week's list, based on your feedback:<br />
<br />
<br />
1.      Taunt.   Success rate, particularly the steep decline vs. Yellow/Red mobs, is too low and too unreliable (currently being evaluated), taunting when OOR causes taunt button to grey out (fix for this should be going on Test in mid-October)<br />

Details:   Effect has 3 major issues:   <br />
<br />
1. Duration of 60 seconds:  Please change to 'until rune aspect is used'<br />
<br />
2. Cast time: Please change to instant<br />
<br />
3. Currently severaly underpowered in relation to Paladin epic click<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
3.     Endurance Regen:   We need endurance regen from Spells and/or items.   Modrods should provide an endurance benefit equal to the mana benefit.  Also, change + Endurance only augments to +Endurance regen.   (currently being evaluated)<br />
 <br />
4.      reimplement the ability to /disc to see the refresh timer on discs (currently being evaluated)<br />

5.      Re-Evaluate warrior disciplines.  <br />

D. Savage onslaught needs a longer timer or shorter refresh and a MUCH lower endurance upkeep.<br />
<br />
 <br />
6.   Range attack while pulling (New)<br />
 <br />
Note: The proliferation of ranged items which eliminate the use of a bow or thrown item without awkward item swapping, it is requested that the 'Throw Stone&quot; skill be unlinked from the incite line, and a longer range placed on it (100ish feet)<br />
 <br />
 <br />
7.      Add a shield disc or shield usefulness (no change planned at this time) [possibly addressed in Omens - partially anyway]<br />
The following are helpful suggestions as to what can be adjusted to shields to make them something desired.   Above all, when it comes to shields, we want the option to use them for a noticeable benefit.  <br />

9.     Melee Focus Effects:   The current level of melee foci are too limited.   There are no mage summonned melee foci, and melee foci were not retroactively placed on older gear.   The current list of foci is also too limited in what it acheives when compared with caster foci.   (currently being evaluated)<br />
 <br />
10.    Please re-evaluate endurance costs on Omens Disciplines/End skills.<br />
 <br />
Note:  the cost/benefit ratio of omens discs and skills are fairly extreme, and endurance depletion is occurring, with endurance regen being nil, and in some cases below what it was in Gates, this is an issue. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">10-08-2004, 08:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">While I don't believe most of the suggestions presented here go nearly far enough, I'll be as conservative as possible:<br />
<br />
2.3 Not only severly underpowered vs. the Paladin Epic right-click effect, but underpowered compared to some procs available on augments and some weapon procs like Hopebringer's from PoTime (power of the effect and the number of times it goes off in one-hour).<br />
<br />
2.4 The focus effect is fairly weak. So much so, that I for one would prefer a Taunt modifier or Echo of Anger - at least those effects would be of real use on a much more frequent basis.<br />
<br />
7. &quot;UPDATE: The real issues at this time is aggro generation&quot; The issues are the loss of offhand procs, offhand DPS, and a very much less useful Epic right-click effect than the one used by Paladins. When Paladins go sword and board, the Epic 1.5 can be clicked from inventory while they get the benefits of the effects/focus effect/procs of the 1 Hdr they are weilding. When Warriors go sword and board, many will be using the Epic 1.5 mainhand and won't get any such extra benefits.<br />
<br />
There's a pattern of asymetric class improvement that's extrordinary. Paladin's get a Diamond-tipped War Javlelin-like Epic (not one-half of a weapon solution like the Warrior 1Hndr, the whole enchillada)  for DPS and normal tanking. For exceptional mobs, they can equip droppable weapons like Blade of Disruption or just use their Hopebringers (nice with the epic effect) in concert with shields (that they have always owned to go with their great 1Hndrs) and take advantage of Shield Block and the Bash +5 on their Paladin only Benevolence Girdle while right clicking the best by far Epic 1.5 effect in the game. No aggro loss, minimal DPS loss, and major major contribution to dealing with ALL incoming damage - DD, AE, DS, and melee.<br />
<br />
 Interestingly this unbeliveable collection of advantages aren't enough - many Paladins KNOW that there would be even more advantage if their epic was a 1Hndr - they are correct, they'd have the most powerful tanking setup in the game - bar none (until they got Epic 2.0).<br />
<br />
So sorry I was wordy, but the list as presented doesn't nearly show just how much room for improvement there is.<br />

<br />
2. Re-Evaluate Epic 1.5/2.0 : YES YES YES<br />
<br />
3. Shield disc a shield usefulness : <br />
A. Shield disc : Make the range BIGGER<br />
B. Furious Bash : Change FB1 to Combat Effects5 (The DPS loss is a tradeoff)<br />
C. Make some nice Tank shield (caster shields are way too close stat wise)<br />
<br />
4. Melee Focus Effects:  MAKE THEM WORK<br />
A. Wizards with 20% MP, will see a huge difference.<br />
Why doesnt a warrior with Dodge3 Parry3 see anything noticable ?<br />
B. A much Wider variety of melee focus on diverse slots<br />
<br />
5. LDoN Add some new gear.<br />
A.With the generalisation of augments and LDoN refund, people have points.<br />
Some really high cost high profile augments would be appreciated :<br />
- 4000 for Ferocity 3 / Cleave 3 / 40% Haste / Combat Effects<br />
- 3000 for Anger<br />
It will revitalise the expansion, and make people want to go back.<br />
B. Add a new &quot;Hardest&quot; mode 200 Points, 1600 max hit<br />
<br />
6. Reimplement the ability to /disc to see the refresh timer on discs  :<br />
I find this useless, what i would love is &quot;Refresh time based on Usage time&quot;<br />
Example : You stopped defensive at 50% ? Well the refresh timer got reduced to 50%<br />
<br />
7. Re-Evaluate warrior disciplines.  <br />
A. Dont have them cant comment<br />
B. Dont have it cant comment<br />
C.  The level 70 discipline needs to be effective against even con and higher mobs : <br />
Super defensive + Root would be a really nice disc (65% Mitigation &amp; Movement to zero)<br />
An upgrade to Stonewall with a reduced duration (1 min)<br />
D.   Dont have it cant comment<br />
<br />
8. Endurance Regen: Zero OOW disc, cant comment<br />
<br />
9. Range attack while pulling : Its a toy but indeed usefull.<br />
<br />
10.Improve stun from kick/slam : Update the lvl so that the ratio PC/NPC remains the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">10-09-2004, 11:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wanted to make you aware, if you weren't, that that Paladin epic right click effect is a minute (greater with AA's?) of 120% MORE effectiveness to heal they recieve, not 20%. BTW, unlike Defensive or the &quot;-1 DI&quot;change which mitigates only melee damage, that helps them survive damage from ANY source.<br />
<br />
Shaman heals will do 9k HP. fast Cleric heals will be fast CH's on a Paladin.<br />
<br />
As you may recall Arch Overseers more or less proved in PoTime that in long fights a well equipped Knight can tank anything a Warrior can tank in a raid. In shorter single group named fights, especialy vs. mobs that do significant non-melee damage, Paladins will be able to out-tank Warriors AND have all the utility of their spellbooks. With Defensive being nerfed in GoD single-group instanced content, is there any reason to invite a Warrior? Any reason vs. KT named?<br />
<br />
The difference in power and the jump in power between the Paladin right-click effect (which is being compared on PoN with Defensive for goodness sakes - the most powerful effect, right-click or Discipline Warriors have) and the Warrior epic right-click is startling.<br />
<br />
Druids Grove? Nah, sounds more like the Cleric class sites when other classes got massive heals and Clerics ended up with nerfed hammers.<br />

this content has been nerfed for the tank pariy issues in single grou^p, but now, with knight's epic1.5 they get it easy. moeover with the lvl70 and the new deff AA it becomes easier. thus remove this def disc nerf now !!!!!</div></div><hr />

There could be better END regen AAs later, but particularly given the lack of END on items like at least some cultural armor, sub-60 warriors can have some difficulty hitting furious and then defensive and getting all the way through the def disc. It's not an issue confined to 65+ warriors.</div></div><hr />

We are a defensive class, not an offensive class.  And the Warriors I've seen using Elemental+ weapons already do some nasty damage.<br />
<br />
The only DPS increase that makes sense to me is upping bash damage some.  Also, I remember when bash used to actually interrupt casters.  I haven't seen that happen in ages.  That used to be the best reason to use it.<br />
<br />
I heard from my brother that SKs got a new AA that does like 10% mitigation and Warriors did not.  Is that true?  If so, it's the dumbest thing I ever heard.  No hybrid should get better mitigation AAs than the one pure tank class.  Sony must be outside thier minds.</div></div><hr />
