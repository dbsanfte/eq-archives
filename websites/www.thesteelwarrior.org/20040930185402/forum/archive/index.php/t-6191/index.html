<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>FulorianC</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">No offense, but do you really think people are going to be making it public? These are fiercely guarded secrets right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Snowz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I agree with Fulorian, I want to keep my 25k tribute item supply as low as possible.</div></div><hr />

no love in here :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>ThornyEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">LOL...unfortunately, it's a little like the people who come to the boards and ask for &quot;the best zone and mobs to make plat off of without having to do any work,&quot; or who go to the crafting boards and ask for &quot;the low trivial recipe that costs 1pp per attempt but sells for 200pp to an NPC merchant for each successful combine.&quot; If such a zone or recipe existed and was common knowledge, everyone would be there or would be crafting it...for the few hours until SOE noticed the discrepancy and swung the nerf bat. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Tribute values are listed in Lucy now.  Go look around :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">items with a 4tribute per plat ratio are on the better side. consider the architect's bejeweled breastplate for example. or gomdurig.<br />
<br />
p.s. sorry but i help people i dont hold secrets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">SoE has already nerfed the values of a few items that were working great; either that or people find out the secrets and raise the bazaar price.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It's not a great ratio, but CHoS sells for about 10k on emarr and gets about 27k in points.  (at least it did immediately after they redid the tribute points)</div></div><hr />

<br />
One option: check cultural tradeskill items that aren't dependent on stupid-rare drops, and check lucy to see what they &quot;donate&quot; for- make sure to check various imbued types, the values seem to be pretty inconsistent.  You probably won't find much that will beat LDON drops, but it's a fairly easy way to keep the trib dude fed.  Obviously requires a skilled TSer, but with the grimmel earring those are a dime a dozen now. :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Buuhmann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">there are some lists with all items / value out there. Check most valueable ones and compare them with bazaar PCs on your server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Drunder50</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Well my cash flow isnt too impressive but what I do is look the the GSoT in bazaar for anywhere btwn 100-200 plat. I get 840 Tribute points for them. If you are lucky you can find 2 or 3 for 200 plat or less. I have seen that a few times already.  Thats a hell of a return for your <br />
plat IMO :-)</div></div><hr />
