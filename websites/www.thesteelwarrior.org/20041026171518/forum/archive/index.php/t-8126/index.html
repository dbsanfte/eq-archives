<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kebast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just a quick survey, where should I level?  I've been 3 boxing LDoN's with a cleric and rogue, should I continue this? or is there a better place to xp.  I do group with others sometimes, but it is a pain to get a group together at that level.  I've done velk's and PoD with a group and the xp was OK, though not sure it was better than I get with LDoN.  Any suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've heard that LDON is the best place for XP until level 55 or so, but with the new &quot;XP hotspots&quot;, you should give the LoY zones a try, as they might be better than LDON.<br />
<br />
I think Torigiran Mines mobs are all level 50-53 or so, and ought to be terrific XP if you can handle it.  For something easier, the harder end of Dulak's Harbor will be medium blue at 51 I think, and should be pretty trivial.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, I might hang out in Velk's a bit.  I've only been there a few times to help people farm silks for the shawl quest.  I did PoJ so much with my cleric I was trying to find something a little different.  Might be back to the basement though :).  Thanks</div></div><hr />
