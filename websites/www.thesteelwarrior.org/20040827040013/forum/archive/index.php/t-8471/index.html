basically this shit was on all servers lotta nice items for 1900, it had to do with the new point  systems on pvp servers or something. This is why they had the emergency patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Svan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i didnt hear of the new items till after they were gone, but while i was in a ldon with my testbuffed shammy on test we had another person sneak into our adventure. nobody knew who this guy was, they werent in the group, and there was 7 people total in our adveture zone. he started following us and eventually took a wrong turn and died, but it was weird.</div></div><hr />
