<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone else a little pissed by the announcements on the boards?<br />
<br />
I mean how many of us threw it in the bank, or still use it, had hoped it would get a upgrade on the merit that we did a long and painful quest.<br />
<br />
Now the fuckers make it a selling point and announce ver 1 has nothing to do with it, and to top it off it seems like its high end only.<br />
<br />
In the first epic it was high end, BUT it was doable by the casual guilds, that is why the rotations were started, but no sir! not in epic 2.0, in epic 2.0 you would have to stab your friends in the back and join a guild like afterlife if you want it.<br />

fuck epic 2.0 ill keep my damn redblade thank you.</div></div><hr />

Nice bone for those already getting the majority of the bones, but nothing of consequence for the average player.  Don't let it get to you, you've already missed out on more bones then you can shake a stick at.  What's one more, more or less?<br />
<br />
EQ has really stopped being a game for anyone not able to devote huge man hours to uber raiding.  Might as well go play CoH, where at least you know that everything available to a hardcore player is also available to you, even if it takes you longer to get it.</div></div><hr />

i'm too busy having fun in another game to care about 'Epic' whatevers. SoE knows what I think of their game when I cancelled my account and that was how I chose to tell them what I think of EQ in general. <br />

I suggest anyone disgusted with EQ; instead of hollerin' it on a messageboard...to do the same. Show them with your $$$'s.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You know, I don't disagree that you're not necessarily entitled to an upgrade just because you exist and play the game.  But it seems to me that there should be small, medium, large, and OMFG that's HUGE rewards.  And there doesn't really seem to be that in the game that much, that you can obtain outside of a raiding guild.  Maybe my perceptions are skewed, I don't know.  But PoP set a precedent for there being crap for loot in much of early zones.  And in LDoN the upgrades take huge amounts of time to acquire, if you can and want to group with people to do it (the reduction to three characters to do LDoN missions was nice, but a little late).   Most of the drops in LDoN are trivial little upgrades that unless you get a whole bunch of them don't make much of a difference.  And even the small purchased LDoN upgrades seem messed up, in as much as you usually need something of higer value already purchased from LDoN to add them to.  I bought a serpent sight augment for example, and then realized that none of my gear had the right socket.  And now GoD seems to be somewhat along the lines of PoP.  Why can't gear upgrades be more available for the common player?  Not upgrades on par with the raiders, certainly, but still something more substantial than what seems commonly availabe.<br />
<br />
Maybe it's my background, since I have velious era gear and cultural armor, there just isn't much in the bazaar that will match or exceed that.  And those things that are available are insanely expensive.  And the things I could camp are pretty solidly camped already.<br />
<br />
I don't want to raid.  And I don't want to spend my life in LDoN dungeons.  But I would like some zones available like Sebilis used to be, where I could go and find upgrades that I'd actually use.  *shrug*  I think I've become jaded, disappointed, and resentful of EQ.  There is such a dramatic dichotomy between the uber player and the average player.  And it only seems to get worse each expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">But see, you gave as your example Seb, which is the same era as the epics, Kunark. In that era, epics were for the uberest of the uber. Eventually mudflation made them doable for all (and obsolete for most). Whether there are good rewards for the non-raider like in Kunark or not is a separate issue (and PoP isn't as bad as you make it out to be, BoT has some very worthwhile stuff for single groups). But the fact is warriors aren't entitled to an epic 2.0 just for playing a class, anymore than they are entitled to a Darkblade of the Warlord. That's life. I play at about the same stage of the game as you Glatius, and I am reconciled to the fact that even if I am still playing EQ when they roll out the new epics, I will probably never have one. And that's fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">1st off, I dont think Gerick was farming the queen in chardok back during Kunark for his epic.  When epics were new to the game you needed to be doing end game content to obtain them.  This will be no different, and when the level limit is 80 another 3 expansions down the track you should be able to one group epic v2.0, and Im sure Gerick will still be here whinging about it.<br />
<br />
As for your casual player upgrades Glatius, while I will agree that PoP was very much an expansion where the rich get richer - the best XP spots were only available to end game players and those same zones were where the best one groupable loot dropped - every expansion has had an amount of content that is one group obtainable and is a step above what players raided for in the previous expansion.<br />
<br />
In PoP you had ornate aswell as mobs like BoT tower named accessible by casual guilds and dropping close to VT quality loot.  In LDoN on hard you can get alot of very nice loot, in GoD the loot obtainable by one group is also very nice, up to elemental quality in Tipt, also raid targets in Ferubi drop elemental quality gear that guilds dont need flags to raid.<br />
<br />
Its not going to be handed to you on a plate and its not trivial content, but it certainly is doable by players to whom the loot that drops will be an upgrade.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh, I don't have a problem with epic 2 being out of my reach, per se.  I still have 3/4 of the items necessary for epic 1 still in my bank.  I've never seen the need to camp Sev or try to muster a team to take down the Queen in Chardok.  I'm not sure what I'm trying to say is really going to come through.  But I guess I've reached a point where I look at the loot and say, hmm hey there's a 10 HP and 2 AC improvement there.  And the mobs in this new expansion hits for 20% more damage than the ones in the previous expansion, so that should set me right up and I'll be good to go.....<br />
<br />
The carrot just isn't tempting enough any more to deal with the rest of it.</div></div><hr />

When you've been a part of a community for a long time, it's hard to just walk away.  Besides most of us still dabble in EQ a bit from time to time.  It just isn't our only or even necessarily primary focus anymore.  And it becomes less and less with each expansion.  Eventually SoE will expand most of us right out of the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thats what i want to see in epic 2.0, or something like the pally epic, if your to gimp to finish, but good enough to get half way at least you still had a flamming sword.<br />
<br />
and Eoden, come back when you can pay attention, i never asked for a silver plate, i asked for a fucking way to do it, i dont care if it takes 3 times as long as doing the epic the raiders way, i dont care if its a fucking 20 hour camp on each &quot;casual&quot; monster, id do it, all im saying is there should be a pathway for players willing to try besides joining some piss ant neonazi raiding guild who thinks they own your soul.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">No, during Kunark, family guilds could not Kill Trak, or get to the Seventh island in sky, or kill the Chardok Queen, etc. It wasn't until much later that epic became easy enough to do by family guilds, even with rotations (outside of a couple abberations like the monk epic). Like late Velious/Luclin. Epics required guilds to kill the top raiding content in the game at that time outside of Veeshan's Peak.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">thats not true gim, back in the day, when people were not whores, people had something called alliances, 2 guilds would work togeather to finish epics, thats why the rotation on emar was changed so that it said EVERY person attending had to be from your guild, to keep out the people that did it with some help from another guild</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">If &quot;back in the day&quot; is defined as during Velious or Luclin, then sure. Not during Kunark. I'm in a casual alliance. Have been since Kunark. I remember when this stuff became doable. VS, Trak, PoSky (post revamp), PoFear (post revamp), Sev, etc. were top end raiding content.<br />
<br />
You want to do top end stuff and not leave your guild, make an alliance. 2 of the high end raiding groups on Karana are alliances, not guilds. Knock yourself out. My alliance is anything but a high end raiding alliance (we doing stuff like Grummus/TT, etc), but it allows my tiny guild (only 6-10 peole usually on duing prime time) to progress and still keep our tight knight guild.<br />
<br />
But all that aside, you don't deserve a warrior epic 2.0 just for being a warrior. Deal with it. You don't have a DBotW. Why aren't you whining about that? What makes you entitled to an epic?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">you think kunark to velius had all that much mudflation?<br />
<br />
And why do you insist that i want anything handed to me? you just probibly think everyone wants their grubby hands on your ph4t l007z.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Goradain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I had simply hoped for a progressive Epic Quest.  I was really hoping to be able to turn my Epic into something... Epic, if you know what I mean.<br />
<br />
While I agree that Epic quests should be very difficult, I do feel that every Warrior who puts the effort and time into it should be able to attempt completing it.  Requiring Elemental+ flags really shuts alot of Warriors off from even being able to attempt it.  But since the will also be raising the level to 70 It's likely that any Warrior in a decent guild will soon be able to give it a go anyway.  I've seen alot of good guilds who simply couldn't handle getting EP flagged because they did not have the numbers needed.  With level 70 it will likely take a little over half the people that it does now.  I sure as hell hope that it doesn't require VT drops, though.  Seriously, would a mad rush for VT be any worse than a mad rush for the Chardok Queen, Kunark Dragons, Fear Golems, Hand and the Spiroc Lord?<br />
<br />
At this point, I dunno if I really care anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I agree gora, i want it to be really hard for me, but not impossible, being progressive would be even better because that means the time people get the best warrior epic, the newbies get the old epic, and a few nice epics in the middle, kind of like building a weapon so powerful that it is living, and changes thru the quest as you complete certain parts.<br />
<br />
an epic that changes in power like the PoP charm changes in power as you knock out content would be awsome</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>FulorianC</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Yes, Velious did gimp down Kunark content. And Luclin gimped down Velious content. Even LDoN and GoD gimped down PoP content, to a degree. Gerick, you honestly cannot believe the Queen of Chardok was doable to a 'casual' guild in Kunark. It wasn't. Any alliance of 50 casual players would get slammed long before they reached queen at the time, and the Queen herself? No chance. You would get throttled by her AE long before she died.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In late Kunark, soon after the release of Velious but before my guild had acquired much in the way of Velious gear, my casual guild formed an alliance with another guild to take down several of the Chardok royals.  We managed, very carefully and using AE tactics for the most part, to fight our way to a safe spot near most of the royals and proceeded to farm them for a number of people.  Someone camped a botted Cleric there for when we wiped and I recall we did once or twice.  However the Queen was enough nastier than the other Royals that no one was willing to give her a try.  <br />
<br />
It could be done.  But it wasn't easy and it took someone leading it who really knew what they were doing.</div></div><hr />

Most of the drops in LDoN are trivial little upgrades that unless you get a whole bunch of them don't make much of a difference.<br />
<br />
I completely disagree.  LDON provides the casual gamer the ability to aquire almost EP caliber loot through time investments that can be made in chunks of 15-90 minutes.  The average time per upgrade for XPing in LDON is FAR lower than the average time per upgrade raiding.  <br />
<br />
Using myself as an example, I can earn enough LDON points for a 1492 point item in 15 missions.  Assuming it takes about 60 minutes or so to complete, that's 15 hours per upgrade for the most expensive type of LDON loot.  That's assuming I never win any of the drops.  If we assume that I do win some of the drops then that average goes up considerably.<br />
<br />
My guild raids 4 days a week for about 5-6 hours a night.  You know how many upgrades I've gotten through raiding in the past 5 months?  One.  A 15 AC augment that I could have gotten by xping in that zone.  Not a single upgrade that actually requires a raid force.  If I had spent a similar amount of time doing LDON missions I could have earned 10000-15000 points.  That's a lot of augments and/or gear upgrades.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I DO get upgrades through raiding that are superior to what the casual gamer has access to but I put in MUCH more time getting them on a per upgrade basis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Don't get me wrong, I DO get upgrades through raiding that are superior to what the casual gamer has access to but I put in MUCH more time getting them on a per upgrade basis.<br />
<br />
Oh, I never argued that raiding wasn't time intensive.  And I would never argue that for every upgrade a raider gets there are probably 10 or 20 raids or more where they get nothing.<br />
<br />
I guess what I'm really seeing these days is that EQ is a time sink.  And not even a particularly fun time sink anymore.  Time for a new game for me.  CoH has at least been a nice change of pace the last few weeks.  And one of the things I like about it is that everyone has the same pool of powers to draw from and enhancements and inspirations are equally available to anyone willing to play.  And you don't have to be in a guild with 50 other people to get your upgrades or farm/camp one or two particular zones.  The stuff drops everywhere with about the same regularity.  So you can pick and choose.  Want to group?  Great, there's rewards for that.  Want to solo?  That's fine too, there are rewards for that.  Want to take on a &quot;raid&quot; like scenario?  No problem, you get rewards there as well.  And none of the options really is any substantially better or worse than the others.  Sure you get a bit more rewards for the &quot;raid&quot; like scenario, but nothing that a dedicated grouper or soloer couldn't match in time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>FulorianC</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Yes, near the end of Kunark, a coalition of casual players were able to get the Queen of Chardok dead. Well, near the end of PoP, a coalition of casual players were able to get Quarm dead. http://www.ecipublic.org/ - Little link I saw while reading through some threads here. A non-guild public alliance that raids PoTime. Whats this about soul killing neonazi guilds Gerick? <br />
<br />
Near the END of OoW, even Gerick will be able to get his epic, provided he is with people with some skill, be it a public or private raiding entity. Within 4 months of PoP the quellious server had 200+ elementally flagged players that were not part of a guild capable of touching RZ. He is merely talking out of his ass, because he wants his epic NOW, and he wants to be able to SOLO it. He doesn't want anything in this game to require large numbers of people, and he wants it to work by his schedule, the way he wants it.</div></div><hr />

Problem with calling those items Epic 2.0 is that for most people, Epic quest are newbies quest, that you can duo at lvl 65 with bazaar gear easily, so expect newbies to do whine about epic 2.0 being hard. But remember, when epic were first put in the game, it was top end loot, that you could only acquire being one of the core member of a top guild.</div></div><hr />

The point is that once upon a time, epics were elite content, now they are easy. Picking apart an extremely minor point doesn't invalidate the argument in any way shape or form. Change &quot;duoed&quot; to &quot;single grouped&quot; if you like, the point still holds.</div></div><hr />

Recap for Gerick. Epics used to be top end raiding content, now with additonal levels and mudflation, they are trivial. The same will likely be true of the new epics. It is the nature of the game, just like it is your nature to bitch like a little girl over trival matters. Get used to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">The chardok queen was hardcore in Kunark.  When I joined my first raiding guild in early velious it was the #2 guild on the server and I coffined out of chardok with them more times than I saw the queen die by far.  Plane of sky was a full weekend raid.  Seriously we would clear up to the pegasus isle and camp for the night, then come back Sunday and *try* to get to the top.  More often than not we would wipe to the bees or the spiroks or just plain run out of time.  On the first day of velious I think only 3 guilds on TM had killed Gorenaire (maybe only one I'm not sure) and even they wiped to her regularly.  You could probably count the number of warrior epics on Tarew Marr on your fingers.  There might have been more than 10, but not more than 25 I bet.  Which was why it was so sad that you could replace it with a willsapper hehe, which was a mini-raid at the time but far easier than doing a warrior epic.  The day I got my sleeper's tomb key (already had a willsapper at this point) was the day I quit working on my epic.<br />
<br />
Maybe some family guilds were doing rogue epics, but the hard ones were uber only well into velious.</div></div><hr />

I completely disagree.  LDON provides the casual gamer the ability to aquire almost EP caliber loot through time investments that can be made in chunks of 15-90 minutes.  The average time per upgrade for XPing in LDON is FAR lower than the average time per upgrade raiding.  <br />
<br />
Using myself as an example, I can earn enough LDON points for a 1492 point item in 15 missions.  Assuming it takes about 60 minutes or so to complete, that's 15 hours per upgrade for the most expensive type of LDON loot.  That's assuming I never win any of the drops.  If we assume that I do win some of the drops then that average goes up considerably.<br />
<br />
Using myself as an example, a potentially retired but once *casual* (read: the guild ain't getting EP and I'm sticking around anyway) warrior (65/50, iirc) who played almost every night ... these time calculations are wildly inaccurate for a casual player IMO.  They work for you, but your gear is not typical of the casual gamer, and I doubt that the people you group with are either.  For starters, any group of casual players I group with is gonna do a normal adventure, cuz they're not gonna be geared for hard.  And so, figger 30 adventures per piece and not 15.  Hell, I'm still trying to coax people into Tak (or, I was until recently, when I bought CoH *hehe*).<br />
<br />
And, they fluff it.  Bad pulls are common, and so is panic, esp. when I'm joining in with friends of friends and we don't all know each other.  Often, we lose just due to the inability of the group to keep up with mana requirements - but mostly, we can't get the ideal classes together, and we've made do with some odd line-ups.  We almost always win, but it's tight. And it will often be, until most of us are well geared in top LDoN or its equivalent.  Factor in the 30 - 60 min we often spend looking for our group (and assume we get two missions out of one group), the fact that we win more often at the 75 minute mark and over, and you have approx. 195 minutes for 100 points, or in the ballpark of 50 hours invested per Royal piece, not including the augments.  <br />
<br />
At a guess, I'd say that the time per piece for per-EP casual players varies between 35 and 60 hours total, depending greatly on how quickly groups can be formed, and how good the groups are.  But 15 hours per piece is just a wet dream down here, where I play.<br />
<br />
Yar, I could probably find more capable and better geared people to group with if I wanted to - I could follow some of our ex-guildies who've done just that - but nevertheless, the play opportunities I get right now are very typical of the *casual* chunk of the EQ consumer base.<br />
<br />
It often seems that the casual gamers perspective is that *all teh ubers gotta  do is get a few friends, and they can farm better gear than I'll ever see any time they want*, which is clearly false.  But equally false is the notion from higher up that *a couple weeks in LDoN, and you could be nearly EP geared*.  It's doable, it's fun, and it's a great avenue for the lower-tiered player.  But it's a significant time investment, too.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Britty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">You know whats going to stink about epic 2.0 for me? It's just the frenzy of it all. I don't know what memories you all have of epic version 1 but for me I remember it being people see the word epic and OMFG they must have it. They like to flash it around and pretend it's their surrogate penis, or silicon breasts if youre a female player. Guildies I know, some of them even now with primarys, secondarys and twinks all STILL want their epics, NOT because they need them, but because its a status thing, only, predictably to see them get banked, but hey they still avariciously want their epics even though by todays standards nearly all of them are useless at high end game.<br />
<br />
Epics drive people to avarice. It's like I must have my epic. So there I'll be again and there YOU will be again, tanking for 30 people all over again, listening to the shit cat fights about the one person who got said epic piece and the 4 others who missed out so then we have to come back again, and again, and again ad nauseum....doing the same shit arse script over and over. Having to start again from scratch for something we already accomplished by riding our friends/guildies/other players backs and asking them to do it all over again for us. The people who log into guildchat saying for the 3968th time, I need help with said xxxx epic mob in said yyyy zone when you would rather just raid or single group some fun and then them being offended because they see everyone else get help why don't they?<br />
<br />
Sony are clever, real frikken clever. They scream epic 2.0 and everyone screams how high. You may all say fuck em now, but when that epic 2.0 call comes through you will be in the middle of it just like everyone else. <br />
<br />
The first epics brought out some of the best I've seen in people but also some of the worst behaviour I've seen also. I was glad when it had all wound down and the guild had gotten past it's epic frenzy because that was when the guild and many people I knew were stagnant. Nothing moved forwards very quickly because everything involved having to help person_273 get some epic peice from the arse end of Norrath. That meant we wern't raiding or doing other things to forward our progress. Some may argue helping people get their epics IS forward progress for a collective of people, yes indeed...only if those epics don't get banked by the next expansion is my answer.<br />
<br />
I hope they do it right, I hope they really think about how they implement it else it will cause a second wave of burn out amongst many players and that will be all she wrote. I'm not looking forwards to another 12 months etc of doing the same epic battles over and over and over again, too many other games are starting to look more enticing as it is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
While I agree that Epic quests should be very difficult, I do feel that every Warrior who puts the effort and time into it should be able to attempt completing it. Requiring Elemental+ flags really shuts alot of Warriors off from even being able to attempt it. But since the will also be raising the level to 70 It's likely that any Warrior in a decent guild will soon be able to give it a go anyway. I've seen alot of good guilds who simply couldn't handle getting EP flagged because they did not have the numbers needed. With level 70 it will likely take a little over half the people that it does now. I sure as hell hope that it doesn't require VT drops, though. Seriously, would a mad rush for VT be any worse than a mad rush for the Chardok Queen, Kunark Dragons, Fear Golems, Hand and the Spiroc Lord?<br />

<br />
Epics were evil.  I would say that there was no other bigger guild breaker in the game than epics.  I can remember spending hundreds of hours helping this person camp this epic mob, helping on a raid for that person's epic mob.  Having people stay with the guild I was in just long enough to acquire their epic and then taking a powder.  And person after person whinning and crying about how no one wanted to help them with their epic, when we never saw them on a raid that didn't either involve phat loots for their class or an epic mob for them.  While I did see some good behavior from people involving epics it was, at least in my experience, completely overshadowed by the absolutely horrible behavior of others.  I remember in particular fighting one of the final epic mobs for the SK epic where our leadership had us zerg that damn mob three times and my dying three times as a result, to have the SK involved put in an app to another guild and leave within two weeks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">Epics are a fine idea.<br />
<br />
However, they were implemented poorly.  Sure, some things were fixed, like the Ragefire spawn which was so heavily contested.  Now shard farming is about as bad though.  Still, they are flawed.  The mobs that drop the quest pieces are too rare and heavily contested, there is too much infighting about who should get an epic piece, and everyone wants their epic but to get everyone their epic is an insane timesink for a guild.<br />
<br />
Epic 2.0 is going to be exactly the same.  The only difference is a ton of the playerbase has already done Epic 1.0 and the thought of going through that again makes them cringe.  I know it makes me cringe.  I think back to all the times I had to get help and kill Phinny to get the wizard epic piece off him...  it was ludicrous.<br />
<br />
I am guessing that other games will have similar types of quests for Epic type weapons that are implemented well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">I hope by now they have learned their lesson that quests with wide appeal that require a drop from a static mob with a long respawn only causes strife.  Most of the newer &quot;epic&quot; quests seem to rely on rare drops from common mobs, tradeskills, and spawnable stuff, which isn't necessarily a ton of fun, but beats fighting with other players for spawns IMO.<br />
<br />
Just say NO to bottlenecks in Epic 2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">If there are no bottlenecks and the Epic quests are doable by casual 65's or above then I will be awed, in shock, but surprised and happy.<br />
<br />
If there are bottlenecks or they are only doable by those in the upper tier guilds I will be sorely disappointed.  That is what I expect to happen, more bottlenecks, only for the top level players, and in that case it will push me more towards different games that are more casual player friendly.<br />
<br />
I am one of those that think everyone who invests the time it takes to get to 65 and get some aa's, and then invests the time it takes to get their epic, should be able to get their epic.  It should not be a requirement that you play Everquest 40 hours a week like a full time job to be able to obtain your epic.</div></div><hr />

I always thought of epic weapons the way it's described there. Back when they were implemented they weren't even close to being 'ordinary' quests. Only a few quests in game were longer than they were, and almost none harder. They were something that when you saw, you stopped to see who that person was.<br />

The old epics are going to remain in the game I'm sure, and I'd guess the new epics will be the same as the old were when they were implemented - geared toward being difficult and rewarding.</div></div><hr />
