We have tried every lame idea there is to kill the 4 adds in Transcendce but they are like the skdj energizer bunny...going ang going and going...  Any input would be appreciated<br />

First of all, Trans is still different on different servers.  More than one set of emotes is out there and kicking.  Second, it's very, very prone to bugs.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sythrak</div><div class="date">03-09-2004, 01:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">They all seem to have major bugs concerning leashes that I've seen, especially Transcendence and Destruction.  We've had instances of being ported to the zone in Destruction, which looks like instead of the mob being leashed, the player is.  Heh.<br />
<br />
Also had a priest in Transcendence that is non targetable mutiple times (it was the container dropper for the 4 rocks).  Either way it's very obvious these never got tuned past beta.  Destruction doesnt even have a single trash mob aside from some that you would have to go out of your way to get to.<br />
<br />
My advice is collect all the key pieces from each raid and corpse them.   You never know when they'll come in handy.  The raids are easily beatable, just very random on what bugs you'll encounter...</div></div><hr />

Your best bet is narrow the ways to a reasonable number and then going through all of them repeatedly, and add voodoo too.  I have heard of things like you got to kill with a rogue using Ton Po's Shuriken while landing a Deadly Strike and that doesn't sound too bad after they come back the 10th time.</div></div><hr />

You forgot the rogue has to do a backflip while landing a deadly strike with the shuriken.</div></div><hr />

That was us - we were deperate at that point heh<br />
<br />
Put it this way, we'd had 8 different classes killshot and/or solo all 4 golems, as well as several other 'theories'. After many hours, and 11% raid AA exp just from killing those same 4 mobs over and over and not a single one staying dead, we were delerious and about to try anything. Next time we tried it, it worked fine with the original killshot 'strat'. Then we moved onto the 'snakes and ladders' raid 4 where you lose if you didn't have inside info or experience. Didn't know this in advance? Go back and try again tommorrow, thx.<br />
<br />
Last week, after we encountered the 'porting everyone to the zone' bullshit. Having already lost a raid trigger icon due to the NPC eating it, we gave up on GoD raids entirely until the next patch (Wednesday)</div></div><hr />

One of the named got leashed and became unpullable. I wouldn't say they are bugged...nope...SOE would never put out an unfinished expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dagz</div><div class="date">03-09-2004, 12:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks guys for the posts.  I needed a good laugh, it helps calm the urge to throttle the developers or whoever is supposed to fix the bugs.  O well maybe we'll  get lucky in 2 days when we can try it agian</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Demorgoth</div><div class="date">03-11-2004, 05:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Went through both 3 and 4 last night with zero problems. Of note, this is the first time we'd had a 54 person limit for these raids as opposed to a 42 limit. Seems like there was a screwed up live patch to fix things and it didn't work across all servers, but the downtime data transfer worked - at least for us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zotha</div><div class="date">03-11-2004, 11:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, first time we had a 54 cap also and it finally worked for us also.</div></div><hr />
