<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rundris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey there,<br />
<br />
I am a level 63 warrior on Lanys T'vyl returning to the game after a 10 month break.<br />
<br />
My gear seems pretty out of date these days. I have my epics, 2h primal, 10th and 9th Coldain rings, Cobolt BP, most other armor is HOT gear.<br />
<br />
During my absense my guild passed through NTOV, and is now doing POP mobs and gearing up for the emperor. Last night we wasted AD in PoV rather easily, and we smoked some guy in BoT as well. A couple nights ago we wasted Terris Thule too.<br />
<br />
We have an RPP system going, and I have no idea what to spend my points on. <br />
<br />
Is there anything I should be trying to get off these lower tier POP mobs, or should I be saving my points for when we get to VT? It seems like it won't be long until we are there. I've heard I can get decent armor in BoT or LDoN.<br />
<br />
What should I be looking for as far as weapons and armor go?<br />
<br />
Any help greatly appreciated!<br />
