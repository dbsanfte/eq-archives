<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bonequest</div><div class="date">02-05-2004, 02:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I logged onto the test server just before the new skills came out and it did something to my texture files for wolves, scaled wolves, and beastlord pet tigers.  All those models look like they have no skin and their eyes are in the wrong places.  It has been messed up ever since and I am sick of it.  I was going to just try deleting all of the s3d files but that is over 2GB so it probably would take forever to reload them all.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know what files contain the textures for these models?<br />
<br />
I hate to go to Sony's tech support because they just send me a stupid form letter saing to send them the same files over and over and never actually answer the question and thought perhaps someone here might know and could save me some time.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">02-05-2004, 05:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">global6.s3d IIRC, but you can delete all of the globals if that doesn't work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bonequest</div><div class="date">02-06-2004, 01:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks guys.  I replaced all the global*.s3d files and it works now.  No more deformed skinned wolves.</div></div><hr />

My wolves look like orange tigers with red stripes.<br />
Skellies look like skellies, but with white gloves and little white shies.<br />
Dogs (pets) look blue, but with orange feet, white faces and purple tails.<br />
<br />
And huge pink beasty pets...<br />
<br />
I thought about deleting and repatching, but no way, I love the creepy 'totally wrong' look :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
look crazy :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renix</div><div class="date">02-07-2004, 03:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">To fix the bugged textured pets, go into your EQ folder and delete all of the files ending in .txc</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bonequest</div><div class="date">02-07-2004, 03:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I thought about deleting all the *.txc files but there was like 1.5 GB worth of them.  Would take quite a while to download them.  Also,  I was seeing them exactly as in the pictures above and I just deleted every file that started with global and ended with .s3d.  that was like 100 MB of files so it didn't take nearly as long and now it all looks good.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Just tested it, you don't have to re download them.<br />
<br />

<br />
Speaking of models and such; What are some solutions to getting Luclin models un-nakedized.  I just deleted my txc files, and maybe that will work.</div></div><hr />
