<br />
What would you do to this if you could<br />
<br />
1) Not gain platinum faster than 1k every week.<br />
<br />
2) Not able to raid for more than 2 hours a day at most with a casual guild just capable of killing Vindi (barely).<br />
<br />
Any ideas? I guess my short-term goal is to break 8k hps with buffs.<br />
<br />
Things I can think of:<br />
<br />
1. Get Shaderock Amulet from Va'dyn.<br />
2. Get Vindi BP one of these days.<br />
3. Get the Everfrost Greaves. (will do this week)<br />
4. Get alliance to take down Eashen for Mask and ring. (not guaranteed to win)<br />
5. Get at least the Terris Flag to get to 80 hp charm on piggyback raid. (btw what is the 90 hp flag after I have AD, MB, POV, POS, HOHB, BOT, COD and TT?) That is PoV, PoS, CoD, BoT, PoTact, HoH, HoHB, PoTorm btw...<br />
6. Find a decent 50 hp range slot item.<br />
7. Get LDON augs.<br />
8. Could faction till cows come home and have a shot at Spirit Wracked Cord. (someday)<br />
9. Just keep going towards the Tak 1492 armor and have ornate-level stuff by 2004 sometime HA HA.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />
<br />

The cheapest elemental bows are probably falling below 20k on my server now. In my eyes that would be much more useful than buying secrets of the planes MQs for a warrior.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have killed:<br />
<br />
Manaetic Behemoth<br />
Aerin Dar<br />
The Trials in POJ<br />
The Minis in POS<br />
The Trials in HoH<br />
Grummus in PoD<br />
<br />
so I have acess to....<br />
<br />
Plane of Valor<br />
Plane of Storms<br />
Crypt of Disease<br />
Bastion of Thunder<br />
Halls of Honor<br />
Halls of Honor B<br />
Plane of Tactics<br />
<br />
So TT wouldn't even get me an upgrade? Blah on that...<br />
<br />
So for 10 more hps I need:<br />
<br />
Bert<br />
MM<br />
Terris<br />
Saryrn<br />
Tallon and Vallon Zek<br />
and RZTW?<br />
<br />
(no sol ro?)<br />
<br />
Please help...getting more confused now!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">10-29-2003, 06:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You are going to have a hard time getting your charm much over 60hp. Of the 10 flag combinations that give a charm upgrade, these are are the hard one:<br />
<br />
1. Time<br />
2. PoFire<br />
3. PoWater/PoAir/PoEarth<br />
4. Tower of Sol Ro<br />
<br />
Without those 4, the best you can do is 60hp.<br />
<br />
As for the rest of your plan, it looks pretty good. I would get your guild to hit the BoT towers. Get some nice weapons and a BP for yourself. I would also hit LDoN as much as possible since it is a good source of cash, exp, and APs to spend on armor and augments.<br />
<br />
Saving for an elem bow would be a good plan as well. The Stonewood is a bit overpriced, but the others are coming down in price to reasonable levels. Horde your plats, lots of good stuff you can buy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draganetti</div><div class="date">10-29-2003, 06:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can go camp a couple highly polished gems from tactics for bloodmetal earrings.<br />
<br />
I would save your money for an elemental bow.<br />
<br />
Can your guild do the mujaki thing in nightmare?  I think that's about a 3 group event that you guys can farm for some decent 85hp cloaks if I recall.<br />
<br />
LDoN stuff is probably the easiest time investment for armor.  If you are really on a budget, the miragul stuff is a much better value, depending on what you're upgrading from.</div></div><hr />

<br />
After that looks like you got all the minor stuff.  Next upgrade will be ele/sol ro/fire.<br />

<br />
Jakle, how do you have the 70hp charm? <br />
<br />
HoH - AD (10)<br />
PoTact - MB (10)<br />
PoV/Pos - Trial (10)<br />
BoT - Askr Quest (10)<br />
CoD - Grummus (10)<br />
PoTorm - TT (10)<br />
-------------------------<br />
That's 60 hp. I have all of those flags except Aerin'Dar and I'm at 50hp.<br />
<br />
I don't think HoHb gives you stats...<br />
<br />
For your equipment, you could switch RBB with a Soulscream Belt. Definitely some room to upgrade legs and BP. Perhaps Heiro Cloak instead of CoGP. Another Skeeter Earring or Blood Earring of Rage for the other stats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 02:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Charm upgrades:<br />

5. BoT key quest - 10hp+aa<br />

<br />
Sounds like time is your key constraint Jak...I'd submit you'd be better off doin LDON than doin faction.  IMHO the 760 MiR set should be your bread and butter...in particular getting the greaves with the +8pct dodge mod.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I just did hedge yesterday and got myself a nice 10 hp upgrade and 1 axp pt.<br />
<br />
Bertox gave nada but PoN Hedge gave me an upgrade....  I think it comes down to flags that gives you direct access to a new zone.  Hedge gives access to PoN B.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Warram</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 11:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">First off, after you buy your legs from Everfrost, KEEP DOING MIRAGUL'S. Farm the hell out of LDoN. You'll get upgrades faster there than anywhere else, judging by your play time.<br />
<br />
The Malev armor from Everfrost offers ~20 less hps per armor at half the price. If you want to get geared up any time in the next year with your play time, don't farm the expensive armor. You can still hit 8k. <br />
<br />
As far as raids go, get the Shaderock amulet, Vindi bp only really adds 10 raw hps. Also talk your guild into doing the Ring of Slime in CT. Easy, easy raid and an Acid bracer is about as good as they get. <br />
<br />
Bazaar purchases I'd probably save for a Stonewood Compound bow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jakle Attakle</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 11:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bad, I think I must be wrong on Charm. I must have 50hp one, I will check again.<br />
<br />
Ring of Slime is good advice. My midget druid can get there invis, I know that.<br />
<br />
I definitely noticed that about the EF armor &gt;&gt;&gt; Tak in terms of time and reward.<br />
<br />
Havent dont the Mujaki thing yet, but I bet I could get enough people together to do it. I will look that one up now. I think its the one where you have to kill all otherwise they turn into mob adds at end.<br />
<br />
I will look into soulscream I never thought it was a super strong item. I know it is fairly easy Veksar camp.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the advice guys, I really appreciate it. Not being able to play for 5 hours a night makes Jakle sad :( I will always stick by my 3 year old family guild, but I have led lots of PoP raids, and I will always be somewhat disappointed by my armor and weaps :(<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bonequest</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 01:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is easy to avoid adds on Mujaki.  Kill all that you can when they are forming up.  Once Mujaki becomes targetable, have a couple of SKs go pull.  SK 1 snares Mujaki with darkness, SK 1 runs around the area to separate Mujaki from the unsnared adds.  Then SK 1 FD and SK 2 pulls Mujaki.  If any adds still, SK 2 can FD and another person can tag off him.  SKs having fear immunity helps but not necessarily required.  Can substitute a monk for SK2 and a sacrificial ranger/druid for SK1 if they don't mind eating a death to pull, since ranger/druid snare lasts longer.</div></div><hr />
