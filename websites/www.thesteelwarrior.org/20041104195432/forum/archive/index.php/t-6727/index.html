<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cyphan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My guild just started doing VT a few weeks ago and Ive been looking at possibly upgrading my haste item/combo there but need some advice on whether I should go ahead with my plan or upgrade other items.<br />
<br />
Besides Aten loot the two items that catch my eye are the Cloak of Black Winds and Belt of Mastery. This would upgrade the FH Cloak and Belt of the Destroyer I currently wear. For these 2 slots I get about 70hps minimal AC and tons of stats/resists along with the AoB effect. It seems like a great combo and the cloak is easily the best haste item until elementals, however that would pretty much be my entire dkp pool.<br />
<br />
Just curious of the lasting power of this or if I should just keep the belt and work around that and upgrade haste in the elementals (which still seem far away at this point) where there are better haste options.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Cloack of the Black Wing = Sucks (i still wear one) insanely low ac.<br />
And there are a billion nice cloacks out there.<br />
<br />
Belt of Mastery is really really nice (Cant upgrade it before PoTime).<br />
<br />
If you want a haste form VT : Gorget of Superiority.<br />
<br />
You will not find much better in the EP (Magmaton's is at best mediocre).<br />
And any combo you can come up with (Belt/Cloack/Neck) will probably be inferior to that.<br />
<br />
Gorget + Cloack of Icy Shadows + Belt of Mastery : 90ac 335hp 41%<br />
<br />
This Trio can not be beaten even with EP Loot.<br />
And wont be replaced before you are really really deep into Time.<br />
<br />
PS : From AHR get Mask or Earring.  BP/Gloves are not that good in the end.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Try a Cord of Midnight (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=28890) and Cloak of Icy Shadows (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=28887) combo, like I have. There is basically no better cloaks until Time, and the Cord of Midnight is a heck of a belt. Other options would be to get a Gorget of Superiority (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=28885) for haste. <br />
<br />
  For comparison, the combo you suggested is 50ac (15 + 35) and 225hp (125 + 100) and the other is 65ac (30 + 35) and 210hp. Frankly, the Cloak of Icy Shadows and Cord of Midnight are also much easier to get, because they drop off of the 3 day spawn timer minis. If you go with the Gorget, you'll leave both back and waist slots open for something better, as there aren't many good necks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">best option for haste is the bp of speed if you can get it. you wont replace the bp till time BP and there are plenty of other haste items in potime.<br />
<br />
i dont remember that many cloaks of icy shadows or cord of midnights dropping. saw a few gorgets and shadow footpads.<br />
<br />
nothing wrong with aten bp either, no one farms the rathe, why do u say its not that good in the long run? its a huge ac item with good hp. i have never seen the aten earring or gloves drop, just not something to count on imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">/wave Ludor.<br />
<br />
The Gorget has been the rarest haste drop for us in VT. Followed closely by the cord. The footpads and the BP and the cloak of black wind seems to drop for us the most. Just thought it'd be neat to compare notes. :-)<br />
<br />
Anyways, to the original poster, my pragmatic advice is to go for haste when you can get it. You can work around a 41 percent haste item no matter what you do and sometime between EP and PoTime you'll be able to upgrade haste anyways. So you won't gimp yourself to get the belt or the cloak you want. Haste is haste. And the stat loss between a cloak of black wind and a belt of mastery and some other combo is pretty minimal. (AND ACTUALLY, in your case, it'd be an UPGRADE so it's not that big a deal). Consider that some people's haste item is the earring of endless speed or something and realize that any of the VT haste items are worthy of consideration.<br />
<br />
Good luck in your path. I think you'll be fine no matter which item you go for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've got the same prob, I have belt of the destroyer from NToV for haste, which although I dont really like it, isnt a terrible haste item to have.  It does have 75 hps and 25 ac.  If I were you I wouldnt upgrade to a haste item with less than 100 hps so very few VT items would meet your needs. If your guild is elemental you might just try to get the plate haste bracer from PoE, that is what I am trying for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">BP is really really nice, but 90% of the time most guilds do the Right Mob.<br />
And thats it :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zaboo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">30 AC, 75hps, and 41% haste is actually a decent waist slot item.  There's no pressing need to upgrade it in VT.  Sure, there are better haste items, but you have other slots that need more attention.  If you can, get an AHR BP.  It's 25 more AC than Erad and will last you all the way to PoTime.  AHR drops a good earring too -- Erad.  Again, it's a keeper until PoTime.<br />
<br />
Overall, you have some very good gear for your level of content.  You shouldn't settle for anything less than AHR upgrades.  Your gear is better than mine was when we started VT. heh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">yah, i didnt look at your magelo, its silly to upgrade your current haste till potime or poe haste bracer. belts are really hard to come by, i wouldnt even bother with poe upgrade, just get two raex bracers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Cyphan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thank you for all of the suggestions they really helped make my decision easier.<br />
<br />
My haste item is actually pretty good and I guess theres no pressing need to upgrade it in VT. Like a poster siad haste is haste and there are some in my guild that still dont have a 41perc haste item so Im pretty happy with it in the end. <br />
<br />
And as a followup:<br />
<br />
I ended up picking up a Cloak of Icy Shadows last night and it really is a damn nice cloak. Planning on saving points for Aten loots now and hoping a mask drops, earring would be nice too, this Wed. I also really like the BP of Speed suggestion. I think I would go for it if it did drop. Only reason is I think it would go for relatively low dkp, since most plate wearers have Erad or better (BP of the Void, Kizraks, LDoN) or looking to get an Aten BP.<br />
<br />
Thanks again.</div></div><hr />

I checked your magelo.  Overall, you have some pretty solid stuff.  I'd recommend upgrading your shoulders though, and there are a few really nice shoulder slots that drop in Vex Thal.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Cyphan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Youre right that is one of, if not, my weakest slot right now. In my &quot;soonish&quot; alternate profile I went with the Pauldrons of Seething Darkness. Though, the Shroud of Vigor would add a nice 60hps. Well see what drops first; I think were doing blobs on monday.<br />
<br />
Thanks :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Cyphan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">OK,<br />
<br />
Just another update and another question ..<br />
<br />
I upgraded my shoulder slot with the Pauldrons of Seething Darkness and am happy with that decision. I also got a Belt of Mastery, because, well it was going for a good dkp rate and I couldnt pass it up. By picking it up I now need a new haste item and yes I still wear my Belt of the Destroyer with the other belt sitting in my bag. :( <br />
<br />
My question is: How often does a BP of Speed drop? If its a rare drop I might have to grab some boots off of Emp (have seen 3 of these drop in one kill) or the Gorget, even though I really dont to.<br />
<br />
Thanks again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Argin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Cyphan, are you only looking for VT upgrades?  If you can get a couple groups together you can easily get one of either Yeli talisman, Gauntlets of Dragon Slaying, or Xanamech neck, all 41% haste items that go into some of youre weakest slots, the Shaderock Amulet and Myrmidon Gauntlets, items that need to go soon anyway unless you're banking on both Gorget and Aten gloves.   <br />
<br />
People mentioned earlier in the thread that lots of that VT loot will last you until time or can't be replaced before time, I'll agree with the first claim but not with the second, for items like Belt of Mastery and Cloak of Icy Shadows there are comparable items even before VT (i.e. Belt of mastery is pretty much a Ssraeshzaen Blood Cord with 25 hp and attack with less stats/saves, Cloak of Icy Shadows is a Cloak of Thorns with 25 more hp for a longer clicky cast time and 5 less AC.)  And BP of Speed isnt really that hot unless you need haste badly, Kizraks and Royal Attendant both have advantages over it if you can put haste somewhere else, not to mention Aten and Seru BPs.  If you're looking to get into EPs and/or Time relatively soon (which isn't necessarily true, but since most of this thread uses Time/EPs for comparison, lets say you are), I'd consider pretty much anything out of VT you're looking at except for some of the Aten loot to be a temporary upgrade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kogur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Myrmidon gloves are still pretty solid before Raex.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Cyphan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Sorry if this thread is confusing. I should have just made a new thread since it is a related yet seperate question. I guess I just wanted to keep this my VT upgrade thread. Anyway basically my question is:<br />
<br />
How often does a BP of Speed drop?<br />
<br />
See I decided to stick with the Belt of the Destroyer I had and upgrade other slots besides haste in VT. However we downed a blob and the Belt of Mastery dropped and I put in a bid and won it. Now looking back perhaps it was not a wise decision since I could easily get a Aten loot now with points I used for the belt but Im stuck with the belt and am looking for alternatives in haste.<br />
<br />
The BP of Speed seems like a nice upgrade and a good choice when all things are considered. Its 60ac 125hp with 41% haste. With a 40hp aug it will easily last until a Raex BP and I wont have to worry about haste again until I decide to upgrade to that. Yes the Aten and Seru BPs have better saves and AC, excluding stats. The other alternatives are the Emp boots. Which are 15hp upgrade have some better stats and resists but am losing ac and when elementals roll around Im going to be looking at possibly Raex boots then another new haste item. The other alternative is the Gorget of Superiority, a 20hp downgrade but better ac stats etc than my current neck.<br />
<br />
hmm shouldnt have bid that stupid belt :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>khur sed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">if you're wealthy, you can always use tribute 41% haste.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gorlab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I think tribute caps out at 36% haste, no?  At any rate its really quite cheap if you search the bazaar and tribute points lists for good deals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Zhisz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Belt of mastery is far from a stupid buy imo - I dont see many other belts out there that beat it pre-Time.<br />
<br />
I dont see what Kizraks and Royal Attendant has besides saves that makes them so much better than a Breastplate of Speed. Sure, 3 more AC etc - but thats by far the least compromise you make if you compare it to your standard cloak / back / waist haste items.<br />
If you look at pre-elemental items only, I think you'd be hard pressed to find a combo where your haste, chest, neck and back gives you overall better stats than a BP of speed, cloak of icy shadows, ahr neck and belt of mastery. (a Gorget of superiority or a cord of midnight combined with an ahr BP would also be good combos).<br />
<br />
Personally I wouldnt trade my BP of speed for anything short of a Raex BP. If you can afford using tribute haste, then that might be the best option though.<br />
<br />
Oh, and dont worry too much about what you choose really. Pick whatever you like, or what drops first, or what goes cheap (if you're in a dkp guild).</div></div><hr />
