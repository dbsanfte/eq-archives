<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valeris</div><div class="date">06-19-2003, 08:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah sorry it's a poll :) Placed it here so that hopefully a general cross section of people who play various classes will give input. if you want move it to the Outhouse.<br />
<br />
We've all heard about the 'Efficient Group make up' ie, Tank, Dps,dps, dps etc etc. I'd like people to consider how they spend the majority of their time in game. Do you seek 'efficient' groups above all others to get the boring grind out of the way or do you hang about with friends, pick up random lfg'ers etc.....</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">06-19-2003, 08:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">4 to nothing now.  Even in pickup groups, we tend to pcik new members for the group based on if anyone has a friend/guildy wanting a group.  Far too many 3 tank groups(tho sometimes they are fun, even if slow), more than one 2 cleric groups...hey, if the exp bar is moving and I am having fun, I don't care what classes we have.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CasEci</div><div class="date">06-20-2003, 08:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">#1 and I'd be fishing in PoT with /LFG on for who knows how long.<br />
I'm lucky that one of my best friends and I duo together often (62 Druid)<br />
So definitely #2</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wirmy</div><div class="date">06-20-2003, 01:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My preference, of course, is #1.  I want to hurry up and get to the 50+ section of EQ.  Highest character I've ever had was 47.  So now I'm trying to grind whenever I'm on.  However, 9 times out of 10, I'm going with #2, there's just never really any groups seeking pure efficiency.<br />
<br />
And to top it all off, I find myself soloing because I get into a group and the healer (usually a druid) keeps nuking.  So, well, I leave.  I play a druid as well, so it's not a druid bashing thing.<br />
<br />
Yeah.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mandragor</div><div class="date">06-20-2003, 03:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Frankly, I can't stand #1.  This is my PLAYTIME; if I wanted to be anal-retentive about EQ, I'd bring my boss home to &quot;help&quot; me play it...<br />
<br />
So what if it &quot;gets the most done in the least time&quot;?  If I log off more stressed and pissed than when I logged on, it's a loss.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Binnamar</div><div class="date">06-20-2003, 04:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like efficiency based groups, but they are boring. It's nice to see the exp bar move quite fast. <br />
<br />
But I like the groups of friends more, it addsa  certain challenege to the game I guess. It's also a hellofva more enjoyable.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kiya</div><div class="date">06-24-2003, 07:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I prefer #2.  <br />
Type 1 groups tend to get me (as a cleric ;p) killed off because all they care about is seeing the exp move... never mind that your healer is screaming bloody murder for a breather because she's been at 20% or less mana each time you've pulled... (and yes, I know how to manage my darn mana, thank you.)<br />
As a warrior, I wouldn't know, type 1 groups seem to avoid our class, imo.  ;p</div></div><hr />
