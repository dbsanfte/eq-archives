I was wondering if anyone could recommend some equipment I could get for myself. I am in a small guild that has low raiding capabilities.<br />
As far as I know the biggest thing we have gone for is the terror matricarch in PoN and The Shade, also in PoN.<br />
This was rare occastions and took a few weeks of planning to do. I have ok equpiment for myself but want it to get better. I have around 30k in the bank to spend and could perhaps grow that into 60k-70k after a few weeks but I would prefer to go out hunting.<br />
<br />
Also please dont all shout ornate plate armour. I have never been to BoT nor HoH (but I hope to soon). If I go it would be mostly with pick up groups which means I would have 1 chance in 6 on getting any molds and the way I role the dices that means I wont get them.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Qest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You're looking good.  I'd suggest you consider saving up and buying a 100hp bow, a 36% haste item such has Cloak of Flames, or if you can find one at a good price, a Cowl of Mortality.<br />
<br />
Your next steps as far as upgrades are mostly in LDoN.  I suggest starting with a Ykesha aug on your Greatstaff of Thunder.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">id concur. your looking as decent as you can get without spending silly amounts of cash on stuff like the 100hp droppables or more ornate.<br />
<br />
on the topic of ornate, as far as i konw ornate drops in hoh are hellishly rare. dont discount bot though, its really not that bad if you get a group up on the higher levels and you should be able to tank quite easily with your ac/hps.<br />
<br />
apart from that theres not much more you can do without the help of a raiding guild, apart from from ldon augs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ThornyEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Don't discount BoT and ornate molds. You'll be able to get bracer, gaunts and arms easily enough, maybe other pieces as well. Just remember, everyone else in a group has a 1 in 6 chance as well, and the dice don't really hate you any more than they do anyone else. ;)<br />
<br />
Actually, you have some pretty damn good gear as it is. Feel free to compare my Magelo to yours. I blew a lot of plat to get some of the items I have, and because I'm agnostic and unable to wear the nice +HP gear for RZ or Tribunal worshippers, I'm not ahead of you by any means; and I have two levels on ya.<br />
<br />
You're generally fine as you are. The only piece that I find upgrade-worthy right now is the bow; I'd get a Stonewood Bow if the money's there (they sell for 75Kpp or so on The Nameless).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>paladiin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Aye, don't kid yourself.  You may not think you're uber, but you're not hurting.  There's no xp mob you couldn't handle with your gear, and no raid target you couldn't tank considering your guild's strength.  That's uber enough in my book.<br />
<br />
That said, I agree with the LDoN'ing for augs recommendation.  Slapping either Ykesha or Hate augs on your weapons is an excellent idea.  Outside of that, you're pretty much set for a long, long time, at least until your guild is looking at Planar Progression seriously.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Renix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think the best you could do, equipment wise is just EXP in places where ornate stuff drops. Even if a mold doesn't drop, the general rule for pickup groups is to let everyone roll if they can sell it or trade it for an ornate piece they can use.<br />
<br />
In time, you'll get a few nice upgrades, and then you'd probably be set until you start seriously considering raiding and planar progression. Even now, your equipments are fine.</div></div><hr />
