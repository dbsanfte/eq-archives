<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bror</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Magelo and lucy say it is 31 percent haste.<br />
<br />
its stats are<br />
<br />
9ac<br />
9 str<br />
10 sta<br />
30 hp<br />
5 cold<br />
level 45 required<br />
<br />
Looks good to me, can anyone confrim the haste?<br />
<br />
It seems to sell cheaper then the RBB, but for a warrior i dont see how the RBB is better.<br />
<br />
BBBBRRRRRRRROOOOOOOORRRRRRR!!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Where does it drop?<br />
<br />
Just to know where should I go to :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">According to lucy its 31% haste which is pretty good.  It drops in veksar from the rotting shopkeeper and isn't really that rare at all.  In the last few weeks my friends and I have gotten maybe 7-8 of these belts for friends and to sell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Smakz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">as far as droppable belt haste ... not much better.<br />
<br />
Owns RBB, and its got enough haste to cap with SoV.<br />
<br />
stick with it.  Its a nice belt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>faederya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Not too be too picky.. bu t Lucy saws<br />
<br />
Effect Level 30 <br />
<br />
That;s 30% haste and<br />
<br />
And SoV is<br />
<br />
Increase Attack Speed by 68%<br />
<br />
So that isnt the cap... but hey, like I said just being picky<br />
<br />
I'd suggest grabbing one quickly if its you bag of tea, the drop rate is very common considering the item.    Saw a price war in bazaar last weekend with lowest price of 4 being 20k highest 24k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Off to Veksar to camp it hehe :)<br />
<br />
I really need an upgrade on my haste, and its way bettern than my Shadowy Assasin Sash</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>weidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Where in veksar can u find it?<br />
Today my guild was exploring the place and we got the kylong shinguards, i was lucky enough to win them on a roll :)<br />
<br />
I guess we have to continue past the golems to get to the rotting shopkeeper, is it a long way to get there and what is the camp called?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Lucy reports all haste items at one level below the commonly held percentage, it gives 20 for FBSS, 30 for RBB, 35 for CoF, 40 for Envenenomed Moccasins, etc.<br />
<br />
And you are right, even at 31%, that still 1% below haste cap :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Oh nos! 99% Haste I am suxx0rz!<br />
<br />
&quot;A Revenant&quot; is the PH for the Rotting Shopkeeper. The &quot;Shop&quot; is a small room (only 5 spawns - reveneant/shopkeeper at the back) that is near the very large room that house the iksar golems (they look like juggs from seb) called the &quot;massive golem&quot; room.. also the same room that the Spirit of Garudon spawns in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Rodney</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If you go to Lucy and look  under haste it says<br />
&quot; Increase Attack Speed by 2% (L1) to 50% (L49) &quot;. So it looks to me like the haste percent is lvl + 1 so an effect lvl of 30 would be 31 percent haste.<br />
