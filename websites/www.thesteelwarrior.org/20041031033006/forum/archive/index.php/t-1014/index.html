<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>proteg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hmmm, on a west wall break if the MT gets shadow stepped (which WILL happen) should he just die on the spot if he has a train or kite it around the hill?  <br />
<br />
Or option 3 bring it to camp to aoe mez (assuming 65 MT and channy and two groups of 61+)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rumblingdeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Have them die. SA takes over from there, evac if you have to. Two group breaks are much better than 4-8 groups running all over screwing it up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Slashem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Oh come on guys. This is fear we're talking about.<br />
<br />
He's saying with groups of 60+<br />
<br />
Just be Melee or pet heavy.<br />
<br />
Have a necro or SK  go in and FD just a bit past the zone in point but still on the hill.<br />
<br />
Have them call the clear sign to go through the portal. Be invis. Yes some mobs see invis, but just having invis up lowers your aggro radius.<br />
<br />
On zoning, turn left and run to the west wall.<br />
<br />
Proceed to kill. Know what to kill first. Scarelings first, then on down the line. Once you've cleared the immediate area, then bring in the groups.<br />
<br />
Or bring them in when there's a break and it's clear.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've done fear break a few days ago with me bard and my 2boxed Druid.<br />
<br />
If tank gets ported have him stand still get oriented and then run to camp. No reason dying. Fear = level 48 or so mobs those are very very ez. Also old world mobs that are from 3-4 years ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>faederya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Or get one 61+ chanter with FT4+ and they can AOE stun all day and night.  Nothing easier then mobs not beating on you.<br />
<br />
I suggest if one chanter have them 62+ for there Arcane Self Rune... makes a fizzled or resisted stun easier to channel through the next.  Or have two chanters 58+.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Groticus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">With a 61+ MT if the get shadow steped they should not be drawing a lot of agro.  Should be able to kill mobs off faster than you are gtting the into the camp.  After a few minutes you should have a clear area to start pulling to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rodney</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Option 3 , geeezzzz were talking GREEN AND LB mobs what the hell can they do?   This is a cake walk guys.   This is the way we break Fear and have NO problems what so ever with it,  only we do ae stuns.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Not everyone that raids fear is lvl 62+.  For us mere mortals it's still a pain in the ass, everything is dark blue, and enough of them can still kill you.  (sometimes repeatedly) :)  But for a force like proteg describes, it shouldnt be too hard.  And bard or holy steed kiting is still one of the easiest ways to get the job done. (We wiped 'cause some folks didnt folow directions, and had to call in the post 60 cavalry, bard and shaman kited for a while and eventually got everything under control.)<br />

Beo</div></div><hr />
