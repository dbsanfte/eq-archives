<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Magnas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok hope you all can help me settle a argument between me and my 65 warrior friend i'm a 65 mage.  Here is the deal we have been going back and forth about which of these are better for DPS and ARGO.  Here is what he has Wrath's Edge, Bonechiller, Copper hammer of Striking and Sword of the Bloodswan &lt;SP&gt; for one handress then he has Great Staff of Thunder and Twisted Steel Bastard Sword for 2 handers.  Out of this what would be the best Argo set and then the best DPS set but also taking into account the Stats of all the items.  Im not going to say what either of us think :)  Thanks for the help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dalbe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would say Twisted Steel Bastard Sword best dps,Copper hammer of striking and sword of bloodsworn best aggro</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cenyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i concur</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Magnas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ok so for pure Argo holding the CHoS and SotB.  Would it be enough so for him to take the stat lose.  He has said he holds argo better with those agree.  My big argument is he might hold argo a little better but he loses alot of stats. Do you both think the argo amount is big enough to take the hp and stat lose worth it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I agree with the above and would like to add that against PoP mobs GSoT would be better due to lessened ripostes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Darkoan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">There are far too many factors that you've not included..  To name a few, his AA point spread?  Best DPS/AGRO in which zones?  Fighting which mobs?  As Baadan eluded to defensive capabilities of PoP mobs must be heavily considered.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">To answer the real point you are getting at -<br />
<br />
agro &gt; stats<br />
<br />
It doesn't matter how good his stats are if the mob is hitting a cleric.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grimmlokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I would have to say that anyone who calls it argo should be flogged with an old dead tuna.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Smakz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">riposte rate in PoP is a non issue unless your Elementals or beyond. <br />
<br />
Riposte rate is not what it used to be, dual weilding is still just as viable as it ever was, if not more.  So the riposte issue just doenst hold weight anymore if your outside Elementals/time.<br />
<br />
as far as aggro is considered, Hammer/SotB.  Sell the GSoT, use TSBS for DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Crystara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Copper Hammer and Bloodsworn for aggro, TSBS for dps, rest can be sold/banked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Khabok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I want to see more proof that the Copper hammer/bloodsworn combo is better aggro then GSoT. We were doing HoT last night and had 4 warriors. 2 of us with GSoT and 2 with the hammer/bloodsworn and I was having no trouble keeping aggro most fights. Of course I am Lvl 65 and rest are 60-63.<br />
<br />
But even the 2 fairly equal warriors, at 62 and 63, were tanking an add and the one with the bloodsworn hammer combo commented afterward that the GSoT was damn good aggro cause he kept loosing aggro to it. Maybe the bigger damage hits make up for the fewer stun procs. <br />
<br />
Either way those three weapons have gone a long way to making the less Uber warriors that cant get EB into fairly decent aggro tanks again. And with the prices on all of them dropping daily its a nice change. May not fix all our problems but its a start</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">On the subject of GSoT aggro v the copper hammer &amp; bloodsworn , i was tanking mobs in HoH the other day with the DW combo and lent a friend a GSoT.  What i found is that over time, the GSoT could steal aggro from the DW combo.<br />
 But i prefer the DW combo because i have more chance ofproccing in that first 10-15 seconds of a fight when all the debuffs/slows are landing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Lessiter1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">GSoT is better agro than my GBoS/Copper hammer combo. <br />
<br />
I have PB but not ambidexterity though, so that may be why.<br />
<br />
And the knockback on force shock sucks terribly.  Lucy says it's only pushback:1 but it seems like it's more than that.  1 proc will usually move the mob oor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>radalas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Hijack arert!<br />
<br />
What the heck does ARGO supposed to stand for anyway when people type it?<br />
<br />
I understand Agro to mean the aggressive, hence the mob being aggressive towards you, but....<br />
<br />
to those people who type argo, what are you referring to?  is it a word that people have in mind or just something that’s been mistyped and never got fixed, like &quot;pwned&quot;?<br />
<br />
If its the latter, I have to agree with Grim....  <br />
<br />
:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gerald</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I've always taken agro to mean aggravate, as in to provoke. Argo is a naive way to say agro :p. They think that's how it's written. That's all! I'm serious...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">riposte rate in PoP is a non issue unless your Elementals or beyond. <br />
<br />
Ellies ripostes are MUCH more substantial but its all a measure of how you are equipped to fight the mob (AAs etc).  A person with lesser gear and AAs with a weaker healer mana pool will still find ripostes &quot;substantial&quot; that an ellie equipped group would not.  Its a sliding rule.<br />
<br />
Also:<br />
<br />
Argo = ship from the old star blazers cartoon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kamce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Usually I take &quot;argo&quot; as someone typing too fast unless they do it over and over and over again.<br />
<br />
As for definition, merriam-webster defines it as:<br />
<br />
Main Entry: Ar·go<br />
Pronunciation: 'är-(&quot;)gO<br />
Function: noun<br />
Etymology: Latin (genitive Argus), from Greek ArgO<br />
: a large constellation in the southern hemisphere lying principally between Canis Major and the Southern Cross</div></div><hr />
