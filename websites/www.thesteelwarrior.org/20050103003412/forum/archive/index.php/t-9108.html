<br />
&quot;Gridbar Galund says 'Oh, a hammer! No? Who are you? Where's Gridbar? I need a bottle of milk! No you don't. Gridbar says to eat some bread. Why? Huh? Give Gridbar the receptacle. What? The eye sockets! Give him the socket piece!''<br />
<br />
And then nothing happens.. am I missing something, I got the exp messages previous, Is there a key phrase I'm missing or do I not have something I'm supposed to hand in.  The only thing I could think was to hand the eye's back in, but he took those and returned nothing at the beginning of the text.  Anyhow, any help would be appreciated, I was trying to figure this out until 5 mins before the servers went down.. I really hope my progress was saved  :(</div></div><hr />

He wants you to give it to him, and then he sends you on an errand. When you complete it you recieve the Hilt of Eternal Power.</div></div><hr />

He'll work on it, but I need you to... no wait, Gridbar needs you to do something for him. For me. For who? My sister is in Shadowhaven and needs a keg stamp. Give this to her for her brother. Who?

Koren Galund says 'Excellent, the stamp I've been waiting for! I see you've met my brother. He's nice and a great gemsetter, but not altogether there, if you know what I mean. I really appreciate you doing this for me. Make sure you get this tube back to him. I'm sure he'll need it for whatever job you've got him working on. And be patient with him. He'll get his thoughts out eventually.' <br />
