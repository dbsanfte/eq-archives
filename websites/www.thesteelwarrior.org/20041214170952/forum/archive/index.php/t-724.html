<br />
Do troll warriors get the stun ability like ogres?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">05-19-2003, 10:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In a word: Yes.<br />
<br />
Troll Warriors have an innate ability called SLAM which allows you to stun/interrupt casters without a shield.<br />
<br />
Ogres and Barbarians have the ability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">05-19-2003, 10:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No.<br />
<br />
Troll = 0% Immunity<br />
Ogre = 100% Frontal stun<br />
<br />
Thats ONLY from melee stuns (bash kick slam)<br />
<br />
How ever there is an AA that will give trolls 70-75% all around stun resistance.<br />
Stalwart Endurance. But it only works with Melee stuns.</div></div><hr />

<br />
IF you talk about the ability to stun others, yes they do.<br />
IF you talk about the ability to resist stuns, no they dont.</div></div><hr />

So while trolls aren't immune to frontal stun, they still won't get stunned as much as say, a human...at least at lower levels and/or untwinked.  Not sure how high your sta has to be to get this benefit, but I'm thinking the increments for stuff like that from ability scores is usually 100, 120, 175, 200.  Could be a little off on that though.<br />

If you're an Ogre you're immune to frontal stuns.  If you have Stalwart Endurance you're partially immune.  Otherwise you have normal chance to be stunned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donnel</div><div class="date">05-20-2003, 02:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I gotta admit that I think getting stunned HAS to have something to do with your level. I get stunned alot less now agains dark blues then I did at level 15 against dark blues. <br />
<br />
Nothing conclusive or mind boggling there, just simple observation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Korinn_emarr</div><div class="date">05-20-2003, 03:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It might look like it's releated to your level but I think what actually happens is that since you are a higher level you get missed more and, therefore, don't gets stunned as much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dumptimax</div><div class="date">05-20-2003, 03:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">IMO, the frontal stun thing is not a good reason to jump on the Ogre bandwagon.  Cookie cutter combos are ho-hum  :o</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iskandar</div><div class="date">05-20-2003, 03:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Has a lot to do with your gear/AC Donnel. Max hits = higher chance to stun.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd also add the purely empirical observation that MOVING when you get hit greatly increases the chance you will be stunned; there's a base chance obviously, but movement either greatly increases it, or causes a second check with a different, possibly  higher, threshold.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">05-20-2003, 05:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, Ogres are immune to melee stun from the front arc.  I am not debating that.   According to a couple of threads on the old board, unbuffed sta does indeed have an impact on how often you are stunned.   Start a dark elf warrior and start a troll warrior.  Untwinked the troll should have way more sta.  I'd be willing to bet that the elf will get stunned more often than the troll.  And Remf, I have also noticed that if I seem to get stunned more often if I'm moving...but that may just be due to the fact that if I'm moving when I get stunned I always turn in circles, if I'm not I just stop fighting for a few seconds.  <br />
<br />
Beo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kazzuk</div><div class="date">05-22-2003, 09:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, They pretty much said all there is to say.. cept this... you get stunned alot more often from behind than from the front.. those of ya moving.. are ya facing the mob while moving??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Remf da Troll</div><div class="date">05-22-2003, 04:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hola again-<br />
<br />
Yea, I tend to try and optimize mob placement when I'm MTing, and will &quot;circle&quot; a mob if there isn't a corner handy and the other melee types are being doofs and pushing it around.  I use mouse steering (right click and hold) to maneuver, and when I make a lot of small adjustments I find I get stunned about (guessing here) 2x as much, typically from when the mob hits when I'm making a position adjustment.<br />
<br />
Purely empirical, since I haven't figured out a way to track stuns as a function of what I'm doing at that instant... could be just a random occurance too.<br />
<br />
RdT.<br />
p.s. I'd guess that stuns from behind are more common simply because you get &quot;hit&quot; much more (maybe 30%+) from behind, due to no avoidance checks.</div></div><hr />
