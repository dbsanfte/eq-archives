<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Timmok</div><div class="date">12-05-2004, 08:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well it appears high-end guilds must be folding left and right, because we are getting a ton of X-server transfer apps atm. <br />
<br />
But personally I feel really bad about the current situation and I dont like asking someone to fork out 75$ for a chance of POSSIBLY becoming a member of a guild that might/might not be around a few months later. I doubt any high-end guild with 100% certainty can say they still will be around in 2-3 months from now, given the current abysmal state of the game/outside influences(eq2/wow).<br />
<br />
Why arent SOE providing this service to their valued customers free of charge? These people already bought the game, and pay their monthly fees, they just want to be able to continue to play and enjoy the game they paid for, but circumstances beyond their control caused their current guild/server to not be a viable place for them to play. <br />
<br />
Why should they have to fork out that much money for what I am 100% sure is an almost completely automated procedure? I think its sleazy, and tbh I think people whose guilds collapse instead of feeding the SoE transfer cash cow should cancel their accounts and send SOE a letter clearly explaining why they are cancelling and that they would have been interested in continuing to play if a servermove had been provided to them free of charge. <br />
<br />
Thats what I would do if I ever came in that situation at least. I would feel like a complete idiot for paying 75$ for a service everyone know SOE will be performing for free once they start the inevitable merging of servers.</div></div><hr />

Solution for me would be $10 + 6 month lock out for the service.<br />

(btw, eq2 is/was a bust, very very few subscribers, over 230,000 still on eq1, about 590 subscribers for eq2, and a massive amount to WoW) Or atleast this is what a guide said~<br />
<br />
<br />
Just wonder what happens when people get endgame in WoW and find out theres nothing to do with their uber chars besides pvp. You can only kill people so many times before getting bored. Which is why CS/halo2 and other games die out after a certain amount of time. Then again maybe i'm talking out of my ass because its 2am and i'm too drunk to make sense.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, if it cost $10 then Greifers/ebayers would be hopping servers every 2 weeks and that wouldn't be good either.  That does hurt to pay $75 for some people though.</div></div><hr />

While I disagree with you about guilds being unstable, and I would feel pretty sure in saying my guild will still be around in a couple months, I do agree that the cost to transfer is pretty much BS and is hurting their player retention considerably.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deurgeran</div><div class="date">12-06-2004, 10:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally I think this is an attempt to stabilize server population in preperation for figuring out what server's to &quot;get rid of&quot; and merge with other server's.  Hard to do when Playerauctions has a ton of char's on it right now, and most will be transfered to another server once bought.  If $75 don't do it, watch for the price to go up even more.  THey have to stabilize it to be able to get an accurate count of active server population to know which server's have room to absorb other servers.  THey don't want ot over populate, and they don't want combine servers and still have underpopulated servers.  From what I am hearing, some servers are MUCH more strongly hit by EQII and WoW than others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">12-06-2004, 10:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yes of course, imagine what would happen if they merge two servers with large number of top end guilds like Saryn, Maelin or  E. Marr.<br />

<br />
I would think more along the lines of Tunare,Vazaelle, and Bristle ^ ~<br />
<br />
But, yeah, $75 for a character transfer sucks, would much rather see a $20.<br />
<br />
Although, I won't be xferring any time soon. My guild currently has the most active players in the high end, so we doing ok.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vick</div><div class="date">12-06-2004, 04:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">$75 for a char transfer with gear doesnt suck. <br />
<br />
If you move servers, its inevitable that you'll lose contact with alot of the friends that youve made. With the people who u know to group with who not to and who to ignore ect. . . I see the 75 dollars as are you willing to start over from scratch where noone knows you, you know noone, have to learn the server economy, the &quot;uber&quot; guilds from the &quot;poser uber guilds&quot; (the ones that got time flag but have lost too many members to better guilds that they are stuck in elementals indefinately) ect. If your not willing to pay 75 for that then you shouldnt want to pay $20 dollars. If your not willing to sell out the people u know for 75 then u shouldnt settle for 20.<br />
<br />
If you have a bad rep somewhere and just wanna leave that server because its hell on you but are too cheap to spend 75 bucks. Tough Titty. <br />
<br />
The whole jive about omg my guild is gunna break up because WoW came out! omg omg shut up. If your guild lived through the hey i made it to time i beat eq time to retire phase, its strong enough to live through what i predict to be a short term Fad of WoW. EQ2 busted like was said before. It had no intentions of an extensive high end raid play which is what 90% of eq has become accustomed to. EQ2 took in all the social players that dont get to play a whole lot so it offers more to them. Your guild is stronger for them leaving because now they know how many true raiders or how many people are truely loyal to your guild that they have. <br />
<br />
WoW looks really cool i give it that. As much as i dislike some of Sony's shinanigans, they know how to build a game and keep people playing. People may say omg im just waiting for a new game to come out to quit eq. Most people saying this still play EQ. In 2 months from now your guilds will be here still. <br />
<br />
Yeah a lot of guilds had a surge of low number nights for a week or two. Guess what it was Thanksgiving. Holidays causes this with Christmas its not gunna get better till probably January. But no guild has ever said omg fuck you Christ your gunna cause my guild to break up because of low numbers. Pull your heads out and look at all the aspects of why your guild looks like they are breaking. You lost some to WoW or eq2 but you kept a good core of people that are probably the heart of the guild. Don't be so quick to sell out your guild until you are sure of whats gunna happen.<br />
<br />
My guild for instance hit the same stuff every other guild did. We had some low number nights. Oh well we did epic or exp'd but when it came down to it, we are still progressing.</div></div><hr />

I don't think so, don't forget that WoW is launched only in USA/Canada, the asian and europian launch is for early 2005, and there is much of them that plays EQ too.<br />

but right for the next EQ expension, it will bring back poeple if the next one is as good as OoW.</div></div><hr />

Don't count on it.<br />
<br />
People only look for alternatives if they're not enjoying what they're doing.<br />
<br />
SoE's best bet for an EQ1 expansion at the current time is to build one now, and then wait until people start hitting walls in WoW (content, etc), and release it then.<br />

Releasing one in the near future will have little to no impact on the game at all.  No one who is having fun somewhere else is going to come back.</div></div><hr />

right, but I think that really hardcore gamers, who have only interest in lvling and gearing to get the top end content in order to have the biggest e-penis, will be desapointed by Blizzard's conception of top end content. Tus I think that few of them will come back in some month.</div></div><hr />

Only the developers and PR guys believe that this market is supposed to have infinite growth.  The guys WoW or any other game draws comes directly from all other MMORPGs.  At some point newer games will taking people from the current EQ killers.  That's what progress means.<br />
<br />
WoW and EQ2 pulled a large chunk of people in the Euro/NA region, and those numbers have to come from games that draw its userbase from there.  Since EQ's got the biggest user base there (FF11 is about 50/50 split on Japan/elsewhere) obviously it feels the sting the most as well.  The effect is more so than the previous 'end of EQ' doomsday sayings because those games combine for something like 500K subscribers already and both compete directly against EQ.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Best $54 transfer I've ever made also. If WoW doesn't pan out for me I'll try a different type of game. My brother-in-law keeps trying to get me into BF1942, but I just don't care for the whole military thing. <br />
<br />
Either way, I don't see me re-subscribing to EQ1 again in the near future. Especially since I have &quot;casual 2 years ago&quot; equipment. This game just got completely out of hand in the last few expansions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daeos</div><div class="date">12-09-2004, 06:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's funny, I get bored here and work and start reading these EQ-based threads and it's amazing how many people are down talking WoW. I've read plenty of posts that say &quot;When people get bored of WoW...&quot; and &quot;WoW is so little kiddish and cartoony&quot; and it just makes me want to ask how many of you have actually played WoW?<br />
<br />
The game isn't really that bad, every game has to start somewhere, if high end content is your concern thats usually the basis of most game expansions. Do you think EQ1 had that much high end content before it's first expansion? Of course not.<br />
<br />
I'll take those cartoony graphics over EQs anyday. I want my char not to just have amazing equipment, but if he's equipped for assbeat, he should look like assbeat. I was really dissapointed with my Shadowknight in EQ when here I was, one of the best guild on the server looking like a stringbean with the same armor graphic as a level 10 in bronze.<br />
<br />
Now I'm not here to start another WoW vs EQ1 vs EQ2 debate, but I haven't met one person who hasn't liked WoW, everyone who has been pro-EQ2 and bashed WoW all day without even playing it instantly changed their mind after a week.<br />
<br />
Point being, all of the WoW fuss isn't about nothing. I'm not just some WoW &quot;fanboi&quot;, I just don't think people are giving it enough credit. As I recall they didn't realease any high end raid content for WoW other than possibly Onyxia or whatever, and even if the high end content blows I wouldn't count on people coming back to EQ.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think eventually SoE will have to consolidate some servers (hopefully with some warning to the people affected) but I don't think EQ1 will be dead for quite some time.  There is a huge amount of endgame in this game and I think if EQ1 falls it's going to be less dependent on WoW's advent than a lot of ppl think.</div></div><hr />

Yes, Lost Dungeons of Velious. I mean, who wouldn't want instanced zones such at Northest Temple of Veeshan, Westernest Wastes, etc. Wouldn't it be great?!<br />
<br />
Honestly, tho, I wouldn't be surprised if the next expansion is similar to LDoN in style. Hopefully it has a lot more to offer to the high end game then LDoN did tho. I've also heard news that the next expansion is supposed to be focused on Veeshan, which would be cool. Sorry for the semi de-rail, just the talk of Velious, expansions, etc. got me excited!<br />

EQ2 is EQ1 for dummies... I haven't played WoW but what I hear (people reaching max level in a week  :eek: ) makes me uniterested. EQ1 til I die bitches!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Heh, more like a month, there are only a couple 60s as far as I understand, and it's just because rogues pwn humanoids. The guild I'm running as probably the highest average on the server and most people are about 40-45. <br />
<br />
Either way who actually wants to spend most of their time leveling and grinding? I mean honestly? Blizzard made leveling fast for a reason, and that's because they want people to hit 60 and go explore the game, not sit there for hours on end painstakingly grinding levels for months on end. Seriously, hats off to them for cutting out the annoying bs everyone hated in EQ.<br />
<br />
I hope if they do release another LDoN type expansion it doesn't suck as bad as the first one for your sake. LDoN had so much potential, I mean the best part about EQ was learning the lore behind the game and what better place than old school dungeons. I loved Kunark and would go out of my way to go visit zones like CoM and Chardok, but LDoN turned into a daily point grind-fest with no actual plot or &quot;individualized dungeons&quot; like they boasted about. The only thing personalized about the whole expansion was the way you spent you points, and there wasn't anything unique about it.<br />
<br />
I remember grinding out points for months just for hp augs and clickies, none of the gear was usable and after my first raid taking four hours for three mediocre items I just about wanted to demand my money back. The only useful thing in the whole expansion was the fact that it made it easier for me to get to GoD.<br />

On the upside I have head a lot of good things about OoW. What killed the game for me was when they pretty much killed the old lore and went from exploring ruined cities fighting lost kings, undead and dragons to defending Norrath from alien invaders from dimention whatever. I don't play a fantasy game for a sci-fi plot with swords.<br />

I know I'm totally killing this thread here, I'll gladly move this to the rant section if it's pissing people off.</div></div><hr />
