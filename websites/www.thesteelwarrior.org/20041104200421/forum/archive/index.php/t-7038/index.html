Ele tank qauility?<br />
<br />
I don't think I am. I need more AC and more hp... What do you guys think?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dallatar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You definately need more AA. Without the defensive AA lineup, you are going to get pasted with 8k HPs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">to be comfortable you should be nearer 1600AC 9K hp's buffed.<br />
start getting them aa's..i'd say at least 100 aa's in your primary roles and you'll be okay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Definitely need more AA. I'd test the waters tanking a hard LDoN or in Sol Ro before trying EP, if you have any difficulty at all tanking those, then you're not ready for EP.<br />
<br />
Think about how easy PoV/S became to tank once you got used to BoT, and how easy BoT will be to tank once you get used to hard LDoNs/Sol Ro, and when they become as easy as BoT shoud be now, then you're ready for EPs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lens314</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I just entered Sol Ro this week, and seems like the Sol Ro trashs mobs are very similar to BoT mobs, cept more hp.   Tanked Aryl too, didnt seem too tough, cept getting to him.<br />
<br />
So im taking it Sol Ro is similar to the Elementals, tanking wise?  The exceptiong being named I take it.  We are gonna start going through the RZ event soon..../drool</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Sol ro mobs are more like BoT mobs really. Once you get deeper, they start to hurt more and more though. Use this for a little perspective: EP trash mobs can hit for ~ 1000, sometimes with flurry or rampage. Most mitigate slow alot and lots have procs as well. Sol Ro is definitely a step down. Hard LDoN is a good test grounds; if you're having problems there, then you aren't ready to tank EPs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Shoot for 9khp/1.6kac with LR5/ID5 and you should not be a total mana sponge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ecchu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well my warrior is around 7800 hp buffed 1450ac, and I do okay in eles.  I duo stuff with my druid in Earth, Water, Fire, its not too bad just could be better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I run 10108 hp's and 1750 ac currently. I do fine in the elementals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Keane Abrams</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hard ldon's are much harder than tanking in Earth or Water. I am not flagged for Fire yet so I cannot speak on that zone.<br />
<br />
Earth is easy to tank in. If you can tank Krieger's in BoT without a problem, then you can tank in Earth without a problem.<br />
<br />
I would recommend 8500 buffed hps with 1400 AC and 100 AA's to be able to chain pull in Earth. If you have less than that you can still tank there, just depends on your healers on how fast you can pull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Pag0</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">It totally depends on your healer's skill. I was barely above you when I began tanking in Earth/Fire. Water is a bit harder imo, once you get pass the first 3 mobs.<br />
<br />
Fire Field 1 isn't too bad, nameds will probably own you without 2 healers.<br />
<br />
Basicly, use SolRo and Hard LDoNs as a good test until you can find out for yourself. If you have trouble in eitherof those places, you will hurt in Ele.<br />
<br />
Good luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kodoku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If your healer has any ammount of skill you shouldn't do too bad in Earth...  PoEarth mobs are about equal to BoT mobs, just some of them have an annoying proc.  The named mobs that can do 3k a round non defensive are a pain though.  Just make sure to bring a back up healer and you should do alright.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Hunky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I asked myself the same question and was hessitant about tanking EP.. but I do fine. Atm i have 61aa .. Raid buffed 8300htp 1500ac, LR5 and CS2 .. actually had a healer from an earth group comment that I was tanking pretty well. I think by the time you get CA3 and CS3 you'll do fine. Two hand weapon will help too because Riposites are killers with 1h weaps.</div></div><hr />

I only have ND3,CS2,CA2,and PE<br />
<br />
Can tank in Earth Easy with my friend as a Cleric. On my Paladin, 7.4/1350 I can tank there aswell, but he has CA3,CS3,LR5,PE. So he mitigates and dodges more, it really depends on how well the healers are.<br />

Ele tank qauility?<br />
<br />
I don't think I am. I need more AC and more hp... What do you guys think?<br />
<br />
Until you have PE, LR5, ID5, I wouldn't bother trying to tank, since you would need 30k to 40k HP to compare to an 8K LR5/ID5 tank.<br />
<br />
You need much more AC, I would say 1700 minimum.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Goradain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I just recently started doing Hard LDoNs (2 successful so far).  If Elementals are as hard as that, I'm gonna need more AC and AAs (and a good 2H aggro weapon).  I actually surprised the group I was with last night when I used my 2H epic and held aggro the entire adventure with very little problems.  They were sure I wouldn't be able to do it, hehe.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Most common XP mobs in the elementals are a little easier than hard LDON.<br />
<br />
You don't need 1700 AC (contrary to what above poster said), but you will need EITHER 1700 AC or 9k HP, if you ask me.  And get those defensive AA's asap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Bulbog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Fire Second Castle/field&gt;Hard ldon&gt;Earth&gt;Fire first castle/field.  I consider Fire to be the easiest to tank really just cause Earth mobs are a damn pain in the ass procwise(dd's/snares)  Not really sure what an other poster was referring to mobs that hit for 1k and flurry/rampage.  Only place I could think where you'd see that is maybe the named and second field/castle mobs hit for around that but you reall want to avoid that area for xp anyway.<br />
<br />
As for where the good xp for you would be at, I'd say give first castle in fire and a ledge or entrance group in PoEarth would be ok with a good healer.  I remember when I first got flagged for the eles I had low hp/ac and the armadillo's in earth and some others really tore into me(700dd that they proc a lot)  I personally prefer first castle PoF for more laid back easy xp, well it's actually more of I think it's damn annoying to be snared constantly.  Again, they're on the same difficulty level as kriger's or solro protectors with melee I always considered is/was really easy to mitigate(low atk, hit for 700's but low hits mostly) mixed in with the occasional chanter/wizard/cleric mob that likes to sit around and cast the whole time.<br />
<br />
I personally think the first field in fire is bad xp(pretty much BoT xp if not worse) but there's some nice drops there for others(all/all ft3 belt)  Solro xp isn't that great, or at the time I did solro it always seemed like mobs had too much hp but it could've been the level of gear I/my group was in at the time.  Anyway it could be nice to just go there if ornate could be an upgrade for you or just the cash from greed rolls on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">65 war-- 18aa-- 8k FULLY buffed w/ 1350ac <br />
<br />
For exp at the plane of earth zone in you are fine with a decent group (cleric with proper FT).  Odds are you won't have 18aa for long if you do poE exp regularly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">PoE is the defacto exp zone in elementals. u can pull right to zone and test for yourself, if u die, cleric whatever can zone right out.<br />
<br />
if you can xp in poe, u should, there isnt a better xp zone.  some mobs do hit harder than others though, i would go pulling any armadillos.<br />
<br />
there are good xp spots in fire and water too. most ppl hate water and just more farmable material in poe than fire.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">The first large room in water is pretty darn easy xp.  I've never done a direct comparison between it and fire field 1 to see which is better xp per hour, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">First field in fire is lousy exp.  I would rather go to BoT.  It is easy though, and some nice drops from the named.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Pretty sure some of our beasts tank ok in POE with a cleric  and debuffs landing well.With singles it's mostly about the heals within reason imo.If you've got a good slower and healer and are tanking singles I can't see why you cldn't do the easier elemental camps for group xp.You'll probably need a slower pull rate and more attentive healing so going with friends would likely be best.Also ,I'd prolly stick with even and blue cons for the most part.As your ac/hp climb you'll just be able to pull faster,do higher cons and work with lesser healing/cc.<br />
<br />
I really like castle 1 in fire atm.Easy for me to pull singles and nice aa for any kinda group that gets tossed togeather.We crawled to some named in another castle there filled with red mobs yesterday.It was alotta fun and very good xp.I hate being snared and rooted and so on in poe but still do well there on the ledge.POW sounds like a fun crawl.Although, if I get stuck ma'n trash there on raids Im left feeling tired of the swimming thing hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Detheb Ultimaweapon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">The ones where rangers WS tank and clerics nuke?!<br />
<br />
Yeah, that one~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>bjarki_bearskin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I did ledge in Plane of Earth with 8300 HPs and 1450 AC, but I have LR5 and ID5.  I did fine.  Obviously, with better stats they could pull faster, but we pulled fairly quickly.  Within 2 weeks, though, I have added about 200 HPS and about 50 AC.<br />
<br />
I have to agree that at 8000 and 1350 AC, you really need more AAs.  You might be able to tank, though, if you have a healer on his toes, and you pull slowly.  Just my observation from what I have done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Jenfo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Ok, now, what is the easiest way to gain raw HP and AC. Seems like you got it really fast. Guild i am applying to raids every day, currently Elemental and GoD stuff. I am now Kod'Taz flagged, but since I am an applicant my DKP gained is cut in half and everyone else has been saving up DKP for the drops we are about to get... Any ideas on what I could/should do?</div></div><hr />
