<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Meety Da'Shield</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am wanting to know what i could get as some/a upgrade/s ....<br />
I have around 5k<br />
<br />
BTW In my Magelo one of my bracers is a &quot;Blazing Bracer of Fennin Ro&quot;    IGNORE that.... It is really a Champion's bracer which all i can remember is like 19 ac and 15 hps and few other low stats.<br />

Here is my Magelo:<br />

         Thanks fellow Warriors</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>bigguard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You really should get some haste. <br />
<br />
What you could do is sell both your weapons, pick up a greatstaff of thunder, than you could really buy some hp upgrades, with about the same agro and dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Meety Da'Shield</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hrmmm.... I could never give away my war swords /sigh<br />
<br />
Well.... sounds ok plus at 15k each hrmmm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Meety Da'Shield</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">O.k thanks i have a idea how i can still use and sell somewhat at same time anyone else got anything?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>bigguard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Buy a jagged bone earring or something to that effect, 6ac 40hp 40mana, i got one for 500pp, decent upgrade to orc fang.<br />
<br />
Helanic Tundra greaves would be a huge upgrade to your acrylia plate greaves, you could only afford that if you sold both your weapons and bought a gsot though. <br />
<br />
You could sell your belt of the great turtle, then pick up a putrid belt of rotten hide (16ac 10dex 10agi 65hp) for real cheap, and that would give you some more cash to work with. The effect on the belt of the great turtle really isnt worth not having some good upgrades in other slots imo.<br />
<br />
Any helanic tundra armor would be great for  you, and your helm definatly needs an upgrade. Dented kunzar war helm from the ballroom in veksar (across from shop)would be a really good helm for you. 23ac 8sta 35hp, ive seen it for as low as 2k on mith marr.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, thats all i can think of for now, if i were you i would definatly sell both my weapons and my belt, buy a GSOT and putrid belt of rotten hide and see how much cash you have to work with from there.<br />
<br />
You could always camp the copper hammer and sword of the bloodsworn again easily if you really love them. IMO the GSOT is just as good as that combo though<br />
<br />
Definatly get haste though. Soulscream belt is only about 20k, 31% haste and some decent stats, and enchanted sash of wonder from droga (5ac 35hp 31% haste) sells for about 17k on mith marr.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Meety Da'Shield</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Dang thanks <br />
<br />
And FYI Sol Ro Helanic tundra is cheap<br />
<br />
Got Helanic BP for 5k hehe everythign is around 3-5k<br />
<br />
thanks all that sounds good</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Finish up getting full cultural armor. your weapons are fine for now, imo<br />
<br />
concentrate on leveling once you finish up getting the rest of your set</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Meety Da'Shield</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">that's what i was thinking dima<br />
<br />
anyone got some other ideas for earring slot also or face/helm?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dalbe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Where in Droga does this 31 percent haste enchanted sash of wonder drop?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bulbog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Off Bone Knight Rurri in the house area, single spawn, easy as hell to camp but usually drops the legendary dagger which I got most the time.  Get the jagged bone hoop + either blue saphhire earring(35hp 2AC) or if you have the money throw down for a solstice earring, which cost all together about 4k on my server for the ingerdients.  Sell your belt of the great turtle, heh I hate that belt and it goes for a decent amount which could then buy you the enchanted sash of wonder or rbb for haste.  Otherwise full cultural is the way to go, heh I never realized how insanely cheap the other cultural armor other than FH is, the pieces go for like 1k/3k/5k on my server while FH stuff goes for 10k/12k/15k and the tribunal cultural is just so good.  I'd ditch your helm first for cultural.  I personally don't like the gate neck, nice stats but no AC, so I'd replace that also with the helanic neck.  Also if you have the money bag the IBG's for resist gear and replace it with the Helanic pauldrons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Meety Da'Shield</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hrmmmm.... i like all the help don't realize why i didn't post sooner but ok and BTW about Droga.....         Where is the house area? and where does bone Knight spawna nd do you need full group or 3 or can you duo as a warrior with a healer? also does slower make it better or is it already too easy? Another thing what is IBG's? Also DIMA if you still read this since you a human if i remember since last i saw you are good at blacksmith? got a 250 smithy and brewer in guild but is ogre so if you good maybe we could hook up and get me some Helanic for Bazaar going price or maybe a tad higher (I'm poor)<br />
<br />
Anyone have anywhere i could farm straight money or items /upgrades that sell great? Have a 65 Druid i could use sometimes and rarely a 58 shammy?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Bulbog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Er, meant to say IGS's, your current shoulder piece.  Bone knight ruri camp is easy, a single spawn probably doable if you have a high lvl shaman friend to duo with or just use the 65 druid and solo it heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Meety Da'Shield</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">O.k just sold weps and lodizal belt and got GSoT and Ornate Gloves woot woot<br />
<br />
<br />
Also about Droga I could do it but WHERE is his spawn/what camp/near what camp deep near beginning<br />
stuff liek that also if anyone else has some ideas<br />
feel free to post</div></div><hr />
