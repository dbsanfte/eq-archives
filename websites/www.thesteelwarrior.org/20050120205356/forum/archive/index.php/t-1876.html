<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">daoga</div><div class="date">07-10-2003, 01:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i posted this to thier boards as well, but thought it would be appreciated here as well (this was when i was playing my druid)<br />
<br />
the following fiasco took place on June 20, 2002<br />
<br />
 My thanks to all who participated in the Raid on MM last night,<br />
(listed here in no particular order)<br />
Silonch<br />
Aluwean<br />
Maible<br />
Cacafonix<br />
Feye<br />
Edyensid<br />
Tatas<br />
Pelias<br />
Vilae &lt;seekers of darkstone&gt;<br />
Uddar<br />
Hookajjr &lt;seedless&gt;<br />
<br />
at 8 pm central we started the raid, Pelias, Aluwean, Feye and others had started cleaning MM before the rest of us got there, i think they were bored.<br />
<br />
we got to the Bath with no incident, and proceeded to kill everything in the surrounding areas, again without incident. typically pelias would pull, and by the time i got it targeted and started casting, it was dead.<br />
<br />
at about 9:30 pm central Xicotl popped, and was subsequently dropped like a bad habit. when he popped, i was running halfway across lesser fay with uddar and hookajjr in tow......<br />
<br />
[Thu Jun 20 21:30:48 2002] Aluwean tells bcmm:1, 'he's here!!\'<br />
[Thu Jun 20 21:30:50 2002] Feye tells bcmm:1, 'Assisting Pelias with ~~~~~~~~ Xicotl ~~~~~~~~'<br />
<br />
and then...<br />
<br />
[Thu Jun 20 21:31:13 2002] Cacafonix tells bcmm:1, 'dead'<br />
[Thu Jun 20 21:31:13 2002] Aluwean tells bcmm:1, 'too late'<br />
<br />
they had been late, and since everything was going actually better than i had hoped for, i bounced out to get them.<br />
<br />
this is when things got fun...<br />
<br />
<br />
[Thu Jun 20 21:37:04 2002] You tell bcmm:1, 'if we are going to do the butler let me get these people tjere first'<br />
[Thu Jun 20 21:37:08 2002] You tell bcmm:1, 'on our way to the bath'<br />
[Thu Jun 20 21:37:10 2002] You say, 'follow me'<br />
<br />
[Thu Jun 20 21:37:40 2002] You tell bcmm:1, 'guys we are going to bring a train'<br />
[Thu Jun 20 21:37:43 2002] You tell bcmm:1, 'no way around it'<br />
[Thu Jun 20 21:37:44 2002] Pelias tells bcmm:1, 'Let's wait for train'<br />
[Thu Jun 20 21:37:47 2002] Hookajjr tells bcmm:1, 'woot )'<br />
[Thu Jun 20 21:37:50 2002] You say, 'we are going to keep running, do not stop follow me'<br />
[Thu Jun 20 21:37:55 2002] Soondari tells bcmm:1, 'ok - prep for train'<br />
<br />
i then proceeded to bring the biggest baddest train that the world of norrath had ever seen...<br />
<br />
what followed was about 3 minutes of some of the most awesome carnage i have ever seen... this was a pitched battle of epic scale. the conclave and co stood back to back and handed out death in a wholesale manner....<br />
<br />
[Thu Jun 20 21:41:11 2002] Returning to home point, please wait...<br />
<br />
i of course died<br />
<br />
in fact everyone died, i personally think the bodies were getting too high for pelias and feye to be able to swing thier blades....<br />
<br />
last i saw....<br />
[Thu Jun 20 21:43:34 2002] Feye tells bcmm:1, 'Assisting Pelias with ~~~~~~~~ a deathly usher ~~~~~~~~'<br />
<br />
and then we were all dead...<br />
however here were some of the comments....<br />
<br />
[Thu Jun 20 21:44:45 2002] Feye tells bcmm:1, 'I'm sorry, but that was hilarious'<br />
[Thu Jun 20 21:44:55 2002] Edyensid tells bcmm:1, 'that was a nice train '<br />
[Thu Jun 20 21:44:56 2002] Aluwean tells bcmm:1, 'that it was lol'<br />
[Thu Jun 20 21:45:05 2002] Feye tells bcmm:1, 'that was beautiful'<br />
[Thu Jun 20 21:46:01 2002] Tatas tells the group, 'i took 5 out before i went down'<br />
[Thu Jun 20 21:46:19 2002] Hookajjr tells bcmm:1, 'Tatas u were last on standing i think too'<br />
[Thu Jun 20 21:46:51 2002] Pelias tells the guild, 'That was hilarious'<br />
[Thu Jun 20 21:47:01 2002] Edyensid tells the guild, 'that was fun'<br />
[Thu Jun 20 21:47:02 2002] Pelias tells the guild, 'We had the entire castle'<br />
[Thu Jun 20 21:47:06 2002] Aluwean tells the guild, 'that's the funniest thing i've ever seen'<br />
[Thu Jun 20 21:47:25 2002] Aluwean tells the guild, 'i tried to get out so i could drag bodies back and shit was still pourin in the room'<br />
[Thu Jun 20 21:50:50 2002] Soondari tells bcmm:1, 'this is the strangest group ever, everyone dead and everyone happy!!!'<br />
<br />
so even though we all died, we all had a blast...<br />
<br />
[Thu Jun 20 22:16:51 2002] You tell bcmm:1, 'ok, so do i graduate from Train School now? did i get my diploma?'<br />
[Thu Jun 20 22:17:01 2002] Pelias tells bcmm:1, 'Aye, with honors'<br />
[Thu Jun 20 22:17:09 2002] Pelias tells bcmm:1, 'I never pulled a MM train that good'<br />
<br />
and i may have a new reputation to have to deal with... oh well, could be worse.<br />
<br />
after we all got rezzed, some of us went on to kill Sir Lucan in freeport for part of the soulfire as well, unfotunately, some people took a faction hit with freeport that was not planned on, i will be doing what i can to help people who took the faction hit.<br />
<br />
again, thanks to all those that participated!<br />
