<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Does anyone have any reliable info on what mobs are covered by this bane?<br />
 <br />
Various things I've heard from people include...<br />
 <br />
- old world Deathtouch mobs only (there are hardly any such mobs left)<br />
 <br />
- all pre-POP gods<br />
 <br />
- all pre-POP planar mobs<br />
 <br />
- VT bosses<br />
 <br />
- one person said it also affects POP gods<br />
 <br />
I just got this sword as rotstop, and so far I've found nothing that seems to get the extra +7 DMG.  It's a neat weapon regardless, if outdated, but if there's a time when I should use it in particular, I'd love to know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>bargran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">dont have it myself, but an sk in my guild has, and he says never find any mob hit by extraplanar bane.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cimmar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You Killed Luclin mobs omg. I thought you were morally against that or something</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have heard all of those and more. But have not heard of anyone finding out what the bane works on. I think the most plausable I had heard of was &quot;intended to be used as a bane againest PoP gods&quot;, and of course never implimented.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Arathena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">From the SoE boards:  If we flag any NPC to have &quot;extraplanar&quot; body type, they get the inherent ability to Death Touch. While this might make the sword very desirable to use, I doubt people would hunt in a zone where every NPC can DT you at will ;) <br />
In this context... Option A it is.<br />
<br />
AFAIK, you get the bane damage on Dread, Fright, and about 10% of Sky. Sky sucks alot for a reason.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lens314</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hmm, the wording from Zajeer-Dev makes it sound like that if they are flagged extraplanar, they can DT, but that leaves it open that if a mob can DT, will they have to be flagged extraplanar?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bumraz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Extraplanar hit Kerafyrm when we killed him =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hmm, the wording from Zajeer-Dev makes it sound like that if they are flagged extraplanar, they can DT, but that leaves it open that if a mob can DT, will they have to be flagged extraplanar?<br />
<br />
  Yeah, I think so. Any rate, it's not exactly extra damage to be really concerned over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Arathena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">There's at least two seperate Death Touch spells in the game:<br />
Cazic Touch, AKA: Old world DT - This is the Extraplanar flag Death Touch. Instant cast, unresistable, you lose, 20k damage. <br />
Touch of Vinitrias, AKA: Shei Vinitiras, Exiled's happy zappys - This is a 'false' death touch. It kills you dead, but has a different recycle time, can be blocked by Invulnerability, has a cast time, and can be interrupted. <br />
<br />
Rule of thumb: If it goes SASSINAK!, the bane worked.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Was no server drama intended. Since she has stated several times on these boards that she despises luclin timesinks and never wanted to do them. Was intended as a joke but guess you didn't get it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Doesn't work against Inny in Hate.  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Cimmar, having done the Luclin timesinks has not changed my opinion of them. :) I will never get back the 4 days I spent making two Emp+VT keys from scratch.<br />
 <br />
Thanks for the information, everyone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Cimmar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Lol took me around 3 weeks. But grats on the key's, zone access and the shiney new sword. I have no clue on the extra planar damage, but I do think it is the best looking 2hs in the game.</div></div><hr />
