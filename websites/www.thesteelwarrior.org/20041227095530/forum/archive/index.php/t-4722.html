<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rysingsun1</div><div class="date">12-12-2003, 03:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">my 1hs is capped at 235 or whatever it is at level 58 and my piercing is capped a few points below that. my main and secondary weapons are split blade and hsagra because im a sucker for armor class together these have a raw AC of 50. i dont like giving that up while tanking period.<br />
<br />
frequently i group with a druid and we do pretty well for experience. she heals me and does many other things and she doesnt often have agro problems. she cannot slow so we dont have to deal with the slow on inc problem. but we DO have to deal with the problem that if i practice my 2hs skill i drop about 35 raw AC. and this is where i get to my problem.<br />
<br />
my 2hs skill is only 175 at this writing. i thought that getting 2hs trained up wouldnt be a big deal and i figured i would train it at times i was not chosen as the main tank or perhaps when grouping with her. but in reality there are very few times that i can train it without cutting our rate of experience in half (or in ldon risking losing the mission). problem is that besides the drop in AC im also losing half my damage output. in other words 175 skill is not giving me anywhere near the damage output i expected it to.<br />
<br />
dont let this bummer happen to you. ill get the skill up one way or another but i regret not taking the skill more seriously before when i could have leveled up a lot less painfully.<br />
<br />
i have a really cool 2hb weapon i just got my hands on. my skill is zero in 2hb. i have no clue when i will start working on this skill :(</div></div><hr />

 Take a group with two tanks to Veksar. Play poor man's rogue. You'll get skillups fairly fast. That's how me and my brother did it - I not only got my Bash to 206 (I'm an optimist about shields being made useful in the future), but was able to take 2hb from 40ish to 250 fairly quickly.<br />

 Plus got a bunch of good loot. :D</div></div><hr />

She conned red to everyone, but never attacked back.  Every time she popped in zone, swing until your heart was content to get your skills ups.  Too bad she got fixed on a patch a while back if I remember right.</div></div><hr />

My guild will go raid HF or something easy and If I am not MT I will pull out my 2hb and skill up.<br />

I have all weapons skills up to 255 excipt 2hb which is only 130.<br />

Once you get a good weapon of skill you need to train then start using it and it will max out pretty quickly especially buffed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anker steadfast</div><div class="date">12-12-2003, 09:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Until I maxed my skills, I used to have a rule of thumb that was : Don't let a skill be lower than Level * 3. <br />
<br />
In that case, the skill was high enough to not be completely gimped if a nice weapon dropped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tiejinnie</div><div class="date">12-12-2003, 11:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had a ruling that was, whenever I Dinged, i'd make sure that the first priority was to max all my weaponskills/defensive skills etc, before looking seriously into my next Ding.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Veksar is good idea...I took my piercing from 35 to 240 in 3 nights there after a narathlus dropped, but I could use that offhand and not hurt my tanking.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khumak</div><div class="date">12-12-2003, 12:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I always kept 1 of each weapon type on hand and every time I dinged I made it a point to max all of them before my next level.  The only exception to this for me was 2hb.  I couldn't find a decent 2hb so I still had a skill of like 50 when I got my Rocksmasher.  Still only took 1 day to max but it was annoying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tatanka7th</div><div class="date">12-12-2003, 01:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been trying to max all the skills each level, but just haven't been able to, since it seems for me piercing and the 2H skills just don't want to go up.  This is with 208 DEX, and trio-ing, so the mobs are not going down that fast, I'm getting in plenty of swings.<br />
<br />
As it is now (at 54), piercing is 1 off from max, and 2HB is 13 off, with 2HS 23 off from max, and I'm already 60% to 55.  Went through over 50 mobs without a skillup, for piercing and 2HB.<br />
<br />
Anyone else see this, or am I just having abysmally bad luck?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">12-14-2003, 09:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">my 2hs was around 50 when I hit level 60 - never had a decent 2hs.  Wasnt until I finished my epic that I bothered to spend any time working on 2hs, just beating on other peoples mobs while LFG and stuff.  Didnt take too long to raise.<br />
<br />
I still have a 2hb skill under 20, but it'll be a long time before I need another weapon so Im not gonna stress over it.</div></div><hr />

When I got my gsot4w my 2hb was in the 50s, after couple trips I had it in the 200s and able to use it sparingly on raids if not tanking.<br />
The best is to keep all skills max but sometimes it just doesnt work out that way</div></div><hr />

<br />
Switching to using the Copper Hammer with the Bloodsworn I thought it might be hard to skill up 1hb which was like 25 maybe. But actually I couldn't believe how fast it went. Hammer and Blade were just flying. Throw a little haste on and I love watching the steel fly. Only took a couple days and like everyone said you keep processing. Now I better take a look at piercing.<br />

Even Hand to Hand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anker steadfast</div><div class="date">12-16-2003, 01:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">2 x fine Steel Daggers for Piercing skilling up is good.<br />
<br />
They are Delay 19.<br />
Hmm, I think the vendor sold Velium weapons in Thurgadin might be delay 19 too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gharghael</div><div class="date">12-16-2003, 02:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ever since level 30 or so I always carried a bag full of weapons - one of each type. It's always been relatively easy to max them out every time I level, excepting piercing... I think I shared your &quot;abysmally bad luck&quot; with piercing. But whenever I couldn't get a group I'd just ask some group if they didn't mind if I practiced skills on their mobs, and never got a 'no.' And more than half the time, I'd get an invite to their group when someone left :).<br />
The other day I went to Warsliks Woods and practiced archery on that iksar there - got like 24 skillups with 1600 arrows &gt;.&lt;. Bloody Ancille's Pouch &lt;3<br />
Sometimes when not tanking I'll use a one-hander in primary with nothing in secondary and get some hand to hand skillups.<br />
All in all, it's not very hard to keep skills up if you try.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CATEIRE</div><div class="date">12-16-2003, 03:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yup, the best thing to do is carry a bag of each weapon type. When I started Cat I was told by some EQ Vetrans to do so and it has proven a few times, with drops over the past years, to be very useful.  I even maxed out my h2h.</div></div><hr />
