<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grumbam</div><div class="date">10-29-2004, 02:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It was bound to happen sooner or later .......<br />
<br />
I cought the virus being spread around work, despite using gallons of the &quot;No Dry Hand Sanitizer&quot;. (really just rubbing alchohol in gel form) Being that I spend all day touching other peoples keyboards and mice, it was perhaps inevitable. <br />
<br />
So I took yesterday off work. Getting up at 6:00am in the morning and not feeling like moving around too much I decided to veg in front of my computer and continue my deathly slow crawl to level 70. None of my regular playgroup is online so for the first time in a LONG while ... I'm off to pickupland. <br />
<br />
So I think to myself ... &quot;Self, maybe things have changed, At this ungodly hour there are probably knowledgeable, dedicated, friendly players doing exp&quot;. (I DID mention I'm sick as a dog right?) Well, my first tell was from cleric asking my HP/AC. I reply 10488, 1760 .. come to MPG they say. <br />
<br />
Well MPG is good, so off i go. It a great group, time geared players who don't talk much because their english seems a little dodgy. (except the cleric who probably WAS english due to all the &quot;Blokes&quot; and &quot;Mates&quot; and the flact that he lives in a &quot;Flat&quot;) This group lasted exactly 4 pulls, then several people had to log ... but I came away from it encouraged.<br />
<br />
well, maybe my opinions need to be changed I think to myself. That was a great (although short) group. perhaps not everyone from a foreign land is condesending, snotty, and obnoxious, while at the same time really fucking stupid. <br />
<br />
AU CONFUCKINGTRARE<br />
<br />
I get another invite right off the bat, Wall of Slaughter. That makes my newbie senses tingle, but what the fuck .. I don't have many options. I'm not sure what far away land the people in this group were from, their guild was something like &lt;Gruberburbeanen der Stchupppenzplatz&gt;<br />
<br />
Their berzerker had a pull technique of running out to the middle of the zone and running back with as many mobs as he/she/it could find ... preferably including Shadowhunter then dying at the feet of the druid (who was the primary healer) <br />
<br />
The brilliant necro in the group was contributing mightily to the groups DPS by dotting each and every mob in the fucktard berserkers train with no less then 2 of his best DoTs. He would then promptly sit down (all that mana spent DoTing you know)<br />
<br />
This tactic would get the necro his ass handed to him on the few pulls that the berserker managed not to wipe the group by bringing Shadowhunter along with the other 7 mobs. <br />
<br />
The enchanter gave up on mezzing all the dotted mobs after the first couple pulls and was AFK at his bind point for the remainder of the group waiting for a rez.<br />
<br />
So the necro signals his displeasure to me by saying in /ooc:<br />
<br />
/ooc &quot;Y U NOTANK?&quot;<br />
<br />
/ooc &quot;U need Tank!&quot;<br />
<br />
/ooc &quot;durgadurgadurgadurga U no tanking!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Enough of that shit. I suddenly remember why I don't join pickup grps... but I have no real options so ... <br />
<br />
I join a group consisting of 1 uber geared ranger, and 4 members from 2 different pre-elemental raiding guilds. How bad can this be?<br />
<br />
What a fool I am<br />
<br />
We head off to the &quot;4-Named&quot; camp in Dranik. Which is really not a fucking camp at all, instead it's running all around the fucking zone killing the various placeholders hoping for a named to pop so some asswipe caster can get his latest rune. <br />
<br />
I signed up for an exp group not to kill a mob every 4 minutes farming runes. &lt;shrug&gt; but I don't have any better options so what the hell I guess. TRhe first round of Placeholders dies without a hitch. There's not a lot of exp to be had but at least I'm out of that previous hellhole group. <br />
<br />
Then the jackassery begins ........<br />
<br />
The shaman goes LD<br />
Then the ranger goes LD<br />
The Ranger comes back<br />
The cleric ( the group leader ) goes AFK<br />
The druid has to leave<br />
We get a new druid , but the leader is still AFK and can't invite<br />
Druid gets pissed waiting and takes off<br />
We get another new druid<br />
Cleric comes back from AFK and invites druid<br />
Cleric decides to replace shaman with another shaman<br />
The original shaman comes back from LD<br />
The new shaman arrives<br />
There is confusion over which shaman should be in the group<br />
The cleric goes AFK<br />
Both shaman leave<br />
The cleric comes back and gets the first shaman again.<br />
The ranger goes LD<br />
<br />
.........rinse and fucking repeat!<br />
<br />
After by 11:00 AM (5 hours of playing) I had gained exactly 2% exp <br />
<br />
TWO FUCKING PERCENT<br />
<br />
The moral of the story is....<br />
<br />
if you see my character logged in at 7:00am, please send me a tell and say to me &quot;You assclown!, go solo with your twink beastlord until your friends or guildmates log in !!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Because I'd rather undergo an oversized rectal probe by sadistic aliens then join anoither early-morning pickup group.</div></div><hr />

If I log on in the morning I can guarantee that I will either spend 2 hours LFG because nobody is on, or I will get called to any of the above groups.</div></div><hr />

ROFL!  Classic.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, because my guild is so small and because I live in Korea (GMT+9), I'm pretty much forced to pick-up group.  I've had some bad ones, for sure, but have also had a few good ones.<br />
<br />
If you're used to grouping with friends and guildies (which I prefer to do when they're available) most of the time, it's definitely not worth sifting through the rough to find the occasional diamond.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vilicontus</div><div class="date">11-01-2004, 01:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm lucky enough that my current level of gear gives me a chance to solo in Tier 1 of PoP. Not very easily, but at the least it's fun and lets me finish off the current AA I'm on without having to find groups  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">milloeq</div><div class="date">11-01-2004, 03:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh my goodness.   I was just about to ask Iyacc's question, but then i read a bit further down.  And promptly fell out of my chair laughing.<br />
<br />
if a pickup group is that bad, i leave.  thats why ive gotten a necromancer to 50 so far, for days like that.<br />
<br />
Milloh</div></div><hr />

<br />
And for that exact reason, WoW is going to be so very popular.<br />
<br />
At least for a couple of months, until we find out if the raid content is any good.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Warfust</div><div class="date">11-01-2004, 01:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I 3 box for that reason (WAR/CLR/ENC)<br />
<br />
If no guildies are on (very rare now thankfully) and I invite pickups, I can kick em if they have the IQ and play skill of a pumpkin.</div></div><hr />
