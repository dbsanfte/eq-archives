I can't really explain what it is about them but they all share a certain quality that mixes hard metal with alternative rock that to me is just perfect.

Does anyone know any other bands that sound similar to these?</div></div><hr />

Dig....deeper<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway, if you like them, try.....uh, lostprophets, The Starting Line, uh....Bad Religion, some Billy Talent, Taking Back Sunday, IMA Robot, uh....<br />
<br />
Ask Aclylo, he's more of a music buff!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">heh, lostprophets have a track on the Need for Speed:Underground game i think it was called 'ride' ( great game BTW, best NFS release to date )<br />
<br />
besides that, umm...the new Slipknot ( Vol.3 - The Subliminal Verses ) is pretty good too; and i wasn't a fan of their other releases.<br />
<br />
going through my CD case; only other bands which I like and might fit the bill are Thrice &amp; Mudvayne ( might be too hard tho, more metal than alternative )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Taking Back Sunday is too emo/picnic. And they can't sing.<br />
And Ninja.. IMA Robot? WTF is this techno crap?? Damn, they are horrible.<br />
<br />
Thrice isn't bad but I don't really like the singers voice, and some of their songs are too screamer for me. Deadbolt isn't too bad though, maybe it will grow on me. See You in the Shallows starts out really badass too.<br />
<br />
Mudvayne - Dig starts sweet too, but the vocals are waaay to screamy. I like Mudvayne - Not Falling after the screamer stops &quot;singing&quot; alot, are there any more songs by them that have more of that guy singing? I like him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yeah, Thrice when I first heard it was a bit sketchy; but it kind of grows on ya after a while. <br />
<br />
Mudvayne's album that Dig is on ( L.D. 50 ) is pretty hard; to me my favorite song on there is -1...it's a bit less shouting but still cranks it up just enough. Internal Primates Forever, Nothing to Gein, and Dig do pound it out pretty hard.<br />
<br />
Not Falling is on ( The End of All Things To Come ) and the only lighter-fare song on it is The Patient Mental which in itself rocks out pretty hard. Shadow of a Man, Mercy Severity, and (Per)version of a Truth and come close but it has some shouting. For the Record; Not Falling is my favorite song on that CD :D<br />
<br />
small edit: Go check out Story of the Year's album Page Ave. It might sound good to ya.<br />
<br />
Sorry I wasn't much help. Hopefully others here know more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">What does Story of the Year have besides Until The Day I Die?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">And the Hero will Drown..( also another find from my NFS:U game ).<br />
My friend lent me the CD and thought most of that album ( Page Ave. ) was retty good.<br />
check out more tracks here (http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000C23D6/qid=1089396075/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_1/102-9327271-0071345)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Fuzzee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">AFI, granted some of their songs on the radio are kinda mainstream made-for-radio stuff, but the rest is pretty good.<br />
<br />
<br />
Personally, I like Nerf Herder and The Vandals.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think you can only like Vol 3, or Iowa/Slipknot because Vol 3 SUCKED FUCKING BALLS.<br />
<br />
I've never been so dissapointed in a band as I was in Slipknot after I bought that piece of shit album.  What the fuck does stone sour exist for if they're just gonna turn gay like that?<br />
<br />
God that album is terrible.  If you didn't like Slipknot when they started in the music scene, then you might actually like Vol 3.  If you did, don't even bother wasting the 14 bucks, because I can guarantee you're not even gonna get halfway thru the disc before you rip it out of your CD player and throw it in the street.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">that time of the month haass?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Not at all, I just expect certain things from bands in exchange for me actually buying their album.<br />
<br />
I don't download music off the net, I consider it very poor form.  These are people who are making the music you like for only one reason...because you buying their album enables them to continue to do that instead of getting a job as a janitor.  Hence, if you actually like bands, and want them to keep doing what they're doing (especially smaller bands, anyone who doesn't get massive clear channel time), you HAVE to buy their albums in order for them to keep going.  Type O Negative is a great example of this.  They get basically zero radio time, zero MTV support, but they still have a devoted fan base that allows them to keep producing records and keep touring.<br />
<br />
Now, that being said, you can not go from Slipknot (the album) or Iowa to that piece of trash called Subliminal Verses.  That's just wrong.  It's equivilent to Mariah Carey doing an album of Slayer covers and expecting it to sell under her name.  I popped the CD in, sat down to play some warcraft and kinda got distracted, but in the back of my head I was thinking &quot;Man, this CD sucks.&quot;  The next day I figured i better listen to it again, and actually pay attention this time, and sure enough, whomever did that album has Slipknot held for ransom somwhere because that is not the same band that did Eyeless and Spit it Out.<br />
<br />
If you couldn't really get into Slipknot before, but like that general area of music, you'll probably enjoy Vol 3. If you did, stay far, far away from that album, because it will make you cry inside.  It's like Load and Reload for Metallica ..../shudder.</div></div><hr />

Don't exactly agree. I know some pretty lousy CDs with only a few good tracks...<br />

I will agree on some, but very few. I really enjoyed Scapegoat Wax's first CD and lostprophet's last one (Fake Sound of Progress), but I couldn't stomach half of their last ones.</div></div><hr />

Collective Soul.. damn thats some good old school.<br />
<br />
What is the song that says &quot;conversations kill&quot; its a few years old and thats the only lyrics I can remembed but its said alot in the song..<br />
<br />
Btw, I let my bro listen to Breaking Benjamin and he called it &quot;alligator music&quot; I don't know why he called it that but I guess that's what I like, so any suggestions for other alligator bands would be good plzkkthz~<br />

p.s. Haass don't be so bitter that no one is buying your band's CDs.</div></div><hr />

That's what the radio is for.<br />
<br />
You can listen to that shitty alternative rock wannabe trash all you want, doesn't bother me one bit :p<br />

I could almost agree with you here, except that on the radio, you don't get to choose what is played and when its played. If you have your own copy of the song, you can play anything whenever you want, and over and over again if you so choose. The radio is how you find out about the 1 or 2 songs that you like from a band, not what you rely on to hear them.<br />
<br />
Thanks, Isk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Slipknot always seemed like a manufactured band to me.  Those halloween costumes they wear are proof of it.  No reason for that but to impress teenagers IMO.  Wait and Bleed was a pretty good song, and Spit it Out was ok, but it doesn't suprise me at all that they would change their sound if they thought it would sell more records.  <br />
<br />
There's nothing stupider than a &quot;xx band sucks&quot; thread though.  Everybody has their music that they like or don't like.  It's entirely subjective, so trying to argue whether any given kind of music is &quot;good&quot; or &quot;sucks&quot; just makes you sound like an asshole.  Obviously if any band is selling records and getting radio time then there's a good number of people that like it, and there's no reason to believe their opinion is worth any less than yours, so get off of your soap box.</div></div><hr />

*EDIT - wow they look wacky. I wonder if they just got out of a Mushroomhead concert and said &quot;they look cool&quot;.<br />
In all honesty; I couldn't care too much about what the band looks like; a few replies ago was mentioned Helmet; who looked like a gang straight out of ROTC class and they kicked ass. And to the opposite side of the spectrum; you got Mushroomhead and Mudvayne who play on the whole KISS makeup deals to help promote/sell their stuff; but still remain true to their music and fans. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I'll tell you why people say Nirvana was the best grunge band.  They weren't the first, but they were the ones that finally put the hair bands to bed.<br />
<br />
Pearl Jam:  Wussy, slightly gloomy good voice but not much angst<br />
Soundgarden:  Not wussy like Pearl Jam, but gloomy at most, and occaisionally even a little upbeat<br />
Alice in Chains:  These guys were really depressed, but not angry, lead singer killed himself with drugs...2nd best <br />
Nirvana:  Hate, Anger, Desperation, Resentment, Hopelessness, blows head off with shotgun<br />
<br />
Grunge music was all about being depressed and hopeless, and Kurt was the most depressed and hopeless guy you'll ever meet, and therefore the best Grunge singer ever.  Just IMO. He also had an awesome rock voice, and wrote a great song for tanking Reparm.<br />

Shaddup dude, Fitemore is gonna hurt you.<br />
<br />
Secondly, I'm sorry, but Nirvana wasn't original, they didn't do anything earth shattering, and on top of all of that, anyone that blew their fucking brains out because being a rock star was too fucking hard isn't worthy of any respect.  The fact that 10 years have gone by and I'm still hearing his whiny voice on the radio is total bullshit.  If he had died in a plane crash or of cancer or some shit, fine, a &quot;talented&quot; (and I use the term loosely) man died young, blah blah blah.  As it stands, he's just a pussy and always will be.<br />
<br />
Third :<br />
<br />
There's nothing stupider than a &quot;xx band sucks&quot; thread though. Everybody has their music that they like or don't like. It's entirely subjective, so trying to argue whether any given kind of music is &quot;good&quot; or &quot;sucks&quot; just makes you sound like an asshole. <br />
<br />
You can say the same thing about soft drinks too, but at the end of the day, Tab and Fresca still taste like shit  :)<br />
<br />
4th, Baadan --<br />
<br />
I could almost agree with you here <br />
<br />
You can't disagree with facts.  Look at the list of bands you like.  Now, I can GUARANTEE, that in 5 years, the majority of those bands will not exist, and the main reason that most bands don't make it is simple...they don't make enough money to keep them from having to get a real job and devoting their life to something other than their music.  This is a common occurance, and it happens over and over and over again.  A band will put out one CD, get pushed by their record company, get on the radio for a little while, then when the 2nd CD comes out and the hype dies down, the bands die too.  <br />
<br />
Bottom line, if you want bands to keep making music for YOUR enjoyment, you need to contribute to their fund for doing so.  You lose all right to be sad, dissapointed, upset, etc, if you can't be bothered to buy the CD's of bands you enjoy listening to.  Bands like Metallica aren't going to be hurt by people downloading music (No matter how much they'd like you to believe they are), but Trapt and Breaking Benjamin both have a VERY strong possibility of being gone from view in less than a couple of years.  Now, this wasn't directed completely at you Baadan, because you weren't the one that brought up the downloading music thing, but it's a problem that affects any band that's trying to make a name for themselves, and it's something that everyone needs to recognize if they want to keep hearing the newer bands or the ones on indy labels.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I like some of the new metal stuff, but mostly I stick to older stuff: Metallica, Megadeth, Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, Ozzy, Sabbath, WASP, Testament, etc.<br />
<br />
Usually if I'm listening to something newer like Slipknot and similar bands, it isnt the band I like, it's a particular song.</div></div><hr />

Damn Straight 8).  Actually I wasn't crazy about the first APC CD, but I love 13th Step, and while I think Tools first couple albums (Opiate, Undertow) were their best, I love all of them and will be waiting in line for the new one this fall/winter.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In the year+ before his death and near the release of his last album his stomache pains had been treated and were no longer bothering him. All his friends have said it was the happiest time in his life, he loved his kid etc -- then he takes 3 times the highest known lethal dose of heroin and still has the strength to put his things away, lift a shotgun, aim it and pull the trigger.<br />
<br />
The book I mentioned talks about a lot of that, along with some handwriting samples of his 'note' and  tries to show that the note was actually about leaving nirvana (edited by Courtney, handwriting analysis shows) and made into a suicide note.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Oh, I know what else I wanted to say, Brutul --<br />
<br />
Slipknot always seemed like a manufactured band to me. Those halloween costumes they wear are proof of it. No reason for that but to impress teenagers IMO. <br />
<br />
The &quot;official&quot; reason for the masks is so that they don't get stereotyped or having people focus too much on how they look.  I guess there's a good basis for that since all the fucking teenybopper girls like that Chad Kroger queer looking dude from Nickleback.  Whether or not that's true is open for debate of course.  <br />
<br />
On the other end of the spectrum, with the same motivation is Tool.  Maynard goes out of his way to make sure that his face isn't in videos, there are seldom pictures in the liner notes, and he often wears wigs and other fucked up shit on stage.  He does it to protect his and his family's privacy.  The guy knows full well that he'd never be able to take his kids anywhere if people could pick him out on the street.  Smart move I'd say.</div></div><hr />

then they did blackhole sun and became a mtv band i knew it was over.<br />

kinda like queensryche did after &quot;silent lucidity&quot;.<br />

to bad the good stuff grave, tiamat, iced earth, in flames, damageplan, gorgoth, emperor, ved buesende, dimior bugior,  satyricon, and the like will never be mainstream.<br />

<br />
It was incredible. Soundgarden hit it the most though; there's a track called 'Flower' which is on their 'A-Sides' release ( re-released their good stuff that was no longer in production+newer stuff ) which is definitive Soundgarden. But when Badmotorfinger hit the shelves...i'll tell ya you put on Jesus Christ Pose and crank the volume to max. It's incredible.<br />
<br />
When Cornell moved out and hooked up with RATM's gang...it was like going back in the time machine. Great GREAT album.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">Secondly, I'm sorry, but Nirvana wasn't original, they didn't do anything earth shattering, and on top of all of that, anyone that blew their fucking brains out because being a rock star was too fucking hard isn't worthy of any respect.  The fact that 10 years have gone by and I'm still hearing his whiny voice on the radio is total bullshit.  If he had died in a plane crash or of cancer or some shit, fine, a &quot;talented&quot; (and I use the term loosely) man died young, blah blah blah.  As it stands, he's just a pussy and always will be.<br />
<br />
That's what I'm thinking also. All I ever heard from them was a whiny voice and cheasy 3 chord riffs. No real talent in the band in general except for the drummer. When he offed himself I thought, &quot; Hmm, took longer than I thought. I wonder if he'll be put in the same class as Janis, Jimmy, and the like.&quot;<br />
<br />
Quite a few people want to lump him into that group, but I only see a mediocre player hell-bent for destruction. The difference between the &quot;greats&quot; and him is talent. ;)<br />
<br />

<br />
Oh ya, surprises the hell out of me who people consider to be &quot;great guitarists.&quot;<br />
<br />
The guy I roomed with when I got my first apartment was a guitarist, and the dude was naturally gifted, he could hear a song once and play it.  I learned so much about music and it's structures and how to distinguish people that have real talent from people who just change their riffs around and call it a new song (cough Metallica cough).<br />
<br />
For as highly as I think of him, he STILL could not play Megadeth's Holy Wars : The Punishment Due at full speed (252 bpm or something sick like that).  Dave Mustaine is a talented guitarist.  Kurt Cobain isn't even a skidmark on his underwear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">A guy that is a great guitarist I had never thought of as one is Jack White of the White Stripes.  They preformed at the grammys this year among an amazingly crappy batch of performances and just tore the roof off of the place, including what seemed like a 5 minute guitar solo by Jack.  I always liked the White Stripes, but didn't notice the guitar playing so much until I saw that performance.  <br />
<br />
The &quot;bass line&quot; from Seven Nation Army was probably the most memorable one of the year and he didn't even play it on a bass, it was just some trick he did with a regular electric guitar.  They also don't use any computers/synthesizers, and only play on instruments pre-1973 or something silly like that hehe.</div></div><hr />

Kurt Cobain is not a 'guitarist' in the sense of the other guitarists mentioned. Talk about not being of the same caliber; his mention ( Kurt) in that list is a gross misjustice to those others mentioned.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As far as the overhyped thing goes, that's true.  People go from loving bands to hating them because they get too much airtime.  The local radio station was calling itself the &quot;No Creed, None of the Time&quot; station and I couldn't help thinking that 2 years ago they were the ones that played &quot;With Arms Wide Open&quot; and &quot;Higher&quot; every 15 minutes for months on end and made everybody hate Creed hehe.  Not that I was ever a big Creed fan or anything, but that was kind of ironic.</div></div><hr />

Queensryche used to be a big favorite of mine in the mid-80's. The song &quot;Take hold of the flame&quot; was the first one I heard from them, and went right out and bought the tape. The Warning album tells a story sorta like how The Wall does, but with a hard rock influence. Actually, all of thier albums tend to.<br />
<br />
In my opinion that band is full of talented artists, and song-writers. Has anyone had a chance to see them live? More importantly, can Geoff Tate sing those notes all night long? <br />

<br />
I went and saw Queensryche back in like '91. They did the full Operation: Mindcrime album with 2 big screens in the back playing movie clips that backed up the words to the songs and i gotta say, it was one of the best concerts i had been to. Mindcrime was already a great album and seeing it live was amazing. Geoff can sing live, just like the album sounds. It was awesome. What sorta sucked was, this was the time that Silent Lucidity became so popular and looking around the crowd, were couples on dates, lookin like they just got off work at the law firm or some shit, lol.</div></div><hr />
