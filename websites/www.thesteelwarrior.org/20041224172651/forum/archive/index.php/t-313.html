<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunrack</div><div class="date">04-27-2003, 11:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd like some of your experts opinions on what I should do about the stuff I have.  Firstly I am not a twink.  I am simply sort of lucky.  A friend of mine quit playing and by chance he was playing a warrior and offered me his &quot;goods&quot;  I took them.  I have equiped my warrior with the stuff that I thought was best to wear.  So what do I need help with?  Well firstly...<br />
<br />
1)  What is your opinion about my decision on what I am using with the warrior in comparison to what is still just sitting there in the bank.  (yes my bank is in my magelo profile also)<br />
<br />
2)  What if anything or if everything should I just outright sell to save money for?   Fierce Heraldic?  <br />
<br />
Anyways, I know this is quite a bit to ask but I simply want your opinions so that I may get more in line with the way of thinking of higher level warriors etc.. I really appreciate your help in this matter...  Thanks.  My magelo is on my sig.<br />
<br />
EDIT:  Also included in that number 2 question.. are any of my other weapons that I have any good to keep for now?  or are they considered pretty much trash?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sort of lucky you got twinked ?<br />
<br />
Just heckling ya anyway ;) <br />
<br />
Your gear looks pretty good and should hold out for a while.  Work on getting the levels now and worry about your gear later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunrack</div><div class="date">04-27-2003, 11:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Apologies indeed as I didn't intend to come out as a smart ass hehe.. so yes in simple word I got twinked by a friend as he was quitting.. I meant I didn't do it myself or something.. I am new to the whole EQ thing so mixed the lingo there a bit hehe.. anyways.. thanks for the advice friend...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valnir Lanys</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 01:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There really isn't anything in there thats that wonderful.  I mean unless you don't think that you're going to enjoy playing your warrior I would suggest that you sell it all and just start saving.  If you can manage to purchase one piece of fierce heraldic you'ed be doing good, or even better if you can manage to find some one that will do the combines for a much lower fee then you'll really be doing great.  <br />
<br />
However the best thing for you right now is gaining levels.  A couple good sessions with your gear and you'll gain more HP, AC, and more importantly skills for avoidance, mitigation, and even attack that no ammount of gear could replace that. (unless you're getting uber no-req level gear... but thats an entirely different story.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunrack</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 01:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really thank you for having taken the time to look through my stuff and give me some pointers... Again thanks for all your help.  And yes.. ding ding ding.. is in the future.. I am thinking perhaps I'll make it to around 50ish with this gear while saving and just gaining levels before I touch the subject of gear again... Does that sound right that kind of gear on a 50th war?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valnir Lanys</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 03:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah you can easily make 50 with that gear.  If you want to go the cheap route, get ally to thrug and get thrug armor MQs instead of fierce.  Its not nearly as good but its a couple steps up from what you've got and it'll hold you over till you're 60th.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would keep the idol of the thorned, seahorse cloak, cc gaunts, froglok crown, and the resist jewelry, then try to sell off everything else.  You could wear the idol and cloak, but keep what you have on now in the bank.<br />
<br />
Basically, convert all you can to cash, while keeping things you may use.  If you find a good deal and need money, you can sell the other stuff off, but you have the luxury of not needing to buy any upgrades soon.<br />
<br />
You may want to pick up a sarnak battlehammer (not sure if it has a required level) for 2hb.</div></div><hr />

Engraved Royal Velium Bp ---&gt; Barbed Ringmail<br />

other than that you should be good till your late 40s. keep a lookout for upgrades with hp/sta, but remember ac is just as important!<br />

I was still in almost a full suit of crafted armor and using a wurmslayer and short sword of ykesha at 48, and didnt have much better than that at 50 (Same armor, lammy and centi ss).  I cant access your magelo profile from work (dammit), but based on the previous posts, it sounds like you're going to be just  fine for quite a while. You lucky dog you. :)<br />
<br />
Beo</div></div><hr />

Dunno why but this made me laugh out loud.</div></div><hr />
