<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cister Battle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Question for you.  The pages that drop on the warrior epic quest...are they lootable in a certain order?  Last night spent about 1.5 hrs looking for them with a fellow warrior.  He was down to the cover only and had spent a week trying to find it.  I looted pg1 and 2 along with the ore but nothing else spawned before I ran out of invis potions (6).  <br />
<br />
I was wondering if the spawn order is 1-3 then cover?  Was odd that 1 then 2 spawned in that order.  Also no 3 nor cover.  Any warriors that have completed that part please advise.</div></div><hr />

I just finished these yesterday.  I got page 1 and 3 first.  Then i found 2.  Then I found the cover.  The places I found them were all the ground spawn points shown on Allakhazam's warrior epic 1.5 walkthrough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>TigermaneCT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I was the other warrior running with Cister looking for my cover, I have checked the locs, double checked and triple checked. Ive tried camping one spot and running around to all spots picking up anything and everything. I am starting to get frustrated with this. Today I spent about 4 hours running the cycle for the pages, at first it seemed to go fine but then the cycle stopped and nothing would spawn not even repeat spots in the cycle. I am out of options If I am missing something, someone please let me know. Any help would be appreciated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Caerberus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I ran around DS last week and got all the pages and the cover in a little over an hour. Page 3 was the hardest to find for me. It just took a little running from spawnpoint to spawnpoint. They were all at the locations provised on the walkthru map.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>theodian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i tried the walkthough map that someone posted on here and it wouldnt work for me when i tried to put it in the maps section of my eq files. anyone else have this problem?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">you have to logout of eq to apply the map changes.  At least I had issues when I tried to update while logged in, I think the file is locked by EQ when in use.<br />

Just be patient on cover,  I found just logging in late at night RL was the easiest way to get it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Xolerus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">hehehe are you guys frustrated because you had to look for it for 4 hours??? Poor us warriors that didnt know bout the bug and were still trying to get pages for over a week before the patch.<br />
All pages are working as intended, they are in a 1 hour respaw time, dont need to be in order to loot it, you can loot ore, page 2 , then cover, page 1 and page 3, doesnt matter. Download the map the some kind soul posted here and you will have all locs.<br />
Serious, again epics are unbalanced, Warrior epic is so easy that 3 alts in my server have it already, and Bards/Wizard epic is so dammm hard (because of large numbers) that we cant see many of them here on MS. But well, this is talking for another subject and not here.<br />
