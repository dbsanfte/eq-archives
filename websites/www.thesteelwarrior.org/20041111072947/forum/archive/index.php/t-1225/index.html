<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Guildie was saying to me today drinks are included in the reduction as well but from the wording I thought it was always food only. Correct or is he talking out his ass?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Doesn't make sense for it not to affect both..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jysin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">100% sure it affects both Food and Drink.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The wording made me think it was food only too.  But Jysin is right, it is both that are affected.  It's actually a very useful aa.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fatz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If i could go back and do it again, i would have put 3 into metabolism instead of innate stam :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Very useful for Vah shir, they eat more food than I've ever seen before.  Also, it keeps those stat foods there, and you don't have to force feed yourself so often.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've got metabolism 3 and love it. A stack of Grobb Liquidized meat, and 10lb meat pies lasts forever now. I bought my last stack on may 21st and I still have 2 of each left. I have no other food/drink in inventory and I play 3-4hrs a day on average.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>EgatBearskinner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I hate to admit I spent a point on this (good reason why I no longer have fast AA purchase selected).  <br />
<br />
I use grobb drink and halas pie.  They are both consumed at the exact same rate.   I am almost positive that innate metabolism works for all food/drink.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The first aa of this isn't very good.  You need to get level 2 for it to be really useful.  Level 3 is just plain &lt;3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Braeorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It'll be one of my last AA spends..for the PP, a stack of stat food and drink already lasts me a long time...and for what, 300pp? What does that take y'all, like 10 mins to make?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Sheer laziness though, saves a trip to the bazaar and saves on inventory space (for arrows and crap)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Aeryl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">If you don't have it, you'll think it's a bit of a waste.  Once you get it, it'll be one of your favorite AA purchases.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Once you get that 50-75hp food....<br />
<br />
You will be HAPPY to have metabolism 3.<br />
<br />
Specially when you forget to force-feed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">theres 50-75hp stat food? dont recall seeing any for sale in bazaar. whats it called?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">For those who can't get the party platter, there is Tormentor Stir Fry, 8 agi 8 dex 8 sta 50 hps.  Droppable, and now that Torment is open, might see it on the market more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Heh, don't get your hopes up on that party platter.  Less than 0.1% of people are gonna have both the flag requirements and the willingness to slave over a tradeskill container for 2 years to get it.<br />
<br />
Halas meat pies..3pp in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">It'll be one of my last AA spends..for the PP, a stack of stat food and drink already lasts me a long time...and for what, 300pp? What does that take y'all, like 10 mins to make?Well considering I have like nothing worthwhile left to work on aa wise I figured i'd test it out. Stir fry's dont grow on trees ya know. :b</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">It does not take any flags or special containers to make the Bristlebane's Platter.  Only the Bucket of Crab Legs requires access to zone that a level 65 can't get to by just being level 65.  <br />
<br />
It's certainly within the reach of your joe average level 65 gamer (provided you have the baking skills), as long as you know someone in elemental planes that can provide you with the Bucket of Crab Legs, and the Crab Legs aren't exactly a closely guarded commodity (but not too common either)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">lol i had a look at the subcombines for the bristlebanes, sheesh its as long as my arm. dont think im gonna be trying that anytime soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Aldarion_Shard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">metabolism? youre kidding right?<br />
<br />
eating stat foods means one thing - SOE slipped item decay into the game and the playerbase is fine with it.  item decay sucks.  Screw stat food.  screw buying aa's to make stat food suck less.<br />
<br />
iron rations for life, baby.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">If you don't have it, you'll think it's a bit of a waste. Once you get it, it'll be one of your favorite AA purchases <br />
<br />
Aeryl put it perfectly =p<br />
<br />
Even with iron rations it helps, you simply don't have to carry as many on you, nor have to restock near as often.<br />
<br />
Personally, I'll take any hps I can get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Karlea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I know that as soon as I get a stack of Tormentor Stir Fry I'll invest 3 points into Metabolism. Sure, when you carry Halas Pie with you it's no problem, that stuff is sold for cheap in bazaar everywhere. But once you use food that you can't just go out and buy but have to go farming items yourself for, you'll look at it different and value this &quot;useless&quot; AA high.</div></div><hr />
