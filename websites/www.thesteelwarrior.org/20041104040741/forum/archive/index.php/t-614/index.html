<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">can a guild that has about 20+ on all about 50+ take either of these. tactics, info, strats, how to's etc etc is greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Will probably will a hell of a ride but i'd say ... maybe.<br />
<br />
His rampage has been nerfed hardcore. His DPS cut by 3.<br />
His healing agro cut by 100.  (Thats compared to RC1.0 when SoL came out).<br />
<br />
Clear all the trash.<br />
Pull RC with a bard.<br />
Have a ranger WS (yes yes)<br />
Have MT + RT use arrows just as ranger WS.<br />
Have MT + RT engage when the mob is slowed.<br />
Heal , Nuke, Loot :)<br />
<br />
You may manage to kill him. Will be a very very rought ride.<br />
He may just blow you to pieces.<br />
Big Tank + 4 5 clerics required.<br />
<br />
But he doesnt depop, its easy to CR. And not too hard to pull.<br />
And RC doesnt attract much attention (no insane loot).<br />
<br />
Btw VT guilds just blow him away, if u want a good shot at him<br />
just make sure no VT guild is headed there and if its the case<br />
Ask for 1 shot, and if they kill him try negociate the loot.<br />
(He blocks the entrance to VT)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Never done DS :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you can do Vindi, you can do DS/RC. RC is a similar fight with the rampage. DS flurries so get a good ds on the mt and he will kill himself fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kendolekk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">What level, and how much HP tank you got?<br />
<br />
How many clerics?<br />
<br />
Any way you could churn out 24-30 people?<br />
<br />
I have killed a whole lot of DS/RC, and still am. Right now on our server it is actually pretty contested. We our farming BP of integrites for our priests, so good luck getting RC from us. We haven't worried to much about Doomshade, but I know some other guilds have been trying to get him, some of which I don't understand why. ( BC is doing it to spite my guild, and Pak`Cafan is doin it cuz they have one of our former members that wants DS's ear REALLY bad.)<br />
<br />
Anyway back to the point. Doomshade is pretty much just about the tank and the CH chain. If you got the clerics to keep a tank alive for 3-6 minutes (with 20 I am guessign it would take 4-6 minutes to kill), then you are fine. We killed him last time with 22. Had a 62 warrior with ~7k buffed being healed by 3 cleric chain (5 sec?). Took roughly 4 minutes I think (I wasn't there). If you need any other questions about DS answered (spawning him, positioning etc) /t me in game Dobbo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">we could probably get 4-5 groups. we have a couple ally guilds and then LoG which we are applying to but i wanted it to be a guild only thing. Our MT (3 level 59's) are all around 3300 hp and 1150. i know two are never met one. We have 4 clerics 53+ if not more. I think we where gonna try RC because he is slowable and i know BL is going after him alot so i was hoping it would be a future thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kendolekk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You need a 60 tank. If you have several 59's, I am sure within a week atleast one should be 60?<br />
<br />
RC is cake once slowed. Just control rampage. Last time I killed him, I was being healed by 1 person playing a 62 cleric(bot), 53 cleric(bot), and his Beastlord(main). RC is a gimp.<br />
<br />
Do you have a 60+ shaman?<br />
<br />
62+ clerics for virtue?<br />
60+ cleric for Aego?<br />
<br />
Doomshade can get hairy even at 7k+ hp. You need a solid rotation. One mess up in the rotation and you're done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Wulfran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Doomshade is all about the MT maintaining aggro and everyone else keeping the mob in place.<br />
<br />
I tanked him the first time at 60 with around 6K hp, pre-POP.<br />
- He's not slowable.<br />
- He has hella AC.<br />
- Hits for 400ish.<br />
- Flurries a lot.<br />
- Fairly magic vulnerable.<br />
Get as much damage shield as possible on your MT, both for aggro and DPS. Make sure people understand that if they get hit they MUST turn off attack. We used a fair number of druid/shaman &quot;spam&quot; heals to augment the CH chain, esp when we were lower level/lower hp.<br />
<br />
Could get hairy on your aggro if he has a pebble crusher (I hate stun procs) but thats part of the fun :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">At 3300hp unbuffed the best your tanks will be able to do even with level 65 buffs is going to be around 6khp. DS is going to be really heard to beat with a 6k tank unless you can get a bunch of clerics. I would imagine you would need a 2 sec rotation to keep a 6k tank up against DS. He flurries a lot - seriously a ton, like almost every round even when crippled. To do a 2 sec rotation you will need a minimum of 6 clerics, and even with that many there they will be hurting for mana. If you can get good mana regen a cleric with 3200mana should last about 14 cheals before going oom. That gives you about 2 min 48 sec with a 6 man 2 second rotation, which is not long enough unless yo have some serious DPS.<br />
<br />
If you can get your tanks leveled up a bit with some AAs so you can last 3-4 seconds on the rotation, yor chances for success are much better. With 6 clerics on a 3 second rotation you can expect the rotation to last almost 6 minutes with the same 3200mana clerics.<br />
<br />
Of course this is dependent on your cleric mana regen, which would have to be around 50mana/tick. You would definitely need a bard, KEI+, and they would all have to have horses. PotG+ and one of the Spiritual Dominion line of spells would help a bunch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kirle1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">i've done ok tanking Doomshade and i range anywhere from 5600-6200 depending on buffs available and setup i'm using.  If you can hold aggro, and your clerics know what they are doing you'll survive imho.  If you wipe, tighten down your CH chain and have at it again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>bollix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">doing rc could be tricky unless you can get him slowed fast.  with your level of raiders, you will probably need a weaponshield ranger to disc tank it whilst giving debuff crew a chance to do their thing (tash, malo, bard occlude then slow).<br />
once slowed he wil still be reasonably hard for a sub 60 tank, but still doable.<br />
make sure to set the rampage too. war 1 pings arrows as inc, rampage warrior pings arrows as inc. war 1 goes tanking, war 2 get into rampage range and attacks.<br />
<br />
for ds, it is alll about single target healing and keeping aggro.  your main tank will bneed 6k ish hps. run a fast cheal line on him and wait for mob to die.<br />
<br />
also, the ds spawning - kill 4 dark masters in 15 mins</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kendolekk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Did him again yesterday. We slow him before/as he gets in camp. I rarely tank him for more than 3 seconds without him being slowed. Once slowed hes a huge gimp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Lessiter1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I've tanked both quite a few times pre-PoP.<br />
<br />
Rumblecrush is definately the easier of the 2.  We never bothered to have a WS ranger tank him to get him slowed.  We'd just have the MA engage and the SA shoot a few arrows until assist was called. <br />
<br />
We were killing Doomshade with a 3 second rotation when I was sitting at 6500hp or so buffed at level 60.  We never really had a problem though, because we had an over-abundance of spam healers.  Just as people said before, get a 100+ point DS on the MA.. (Get a bard in the MA group, get a mage DS, and drink a shaman DS potion) and keep agro on the MA.  When defensive drops, have the spam healers step in and keep the MA alive until the clerics can compensate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">have your debuff team sowed and debuff rc on pull.<br />
once debuffed zone out to ME and back once he debuffed pull him to ME zone and kill. Pretty damn ez once your debuff/pull team got it down.<br />
<br />
DS - all info above is good except on my personall note he stuns a lot unless you are ogre. Similar fight to Servitor of Luclin practice on him maybe even. Just DS is not slowable otherwise same deal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">ok i was talking about in the future. in the next 2 months. but thanks for the help. any more is greatly appreciated. by then we will prob have atleast 1 61 tank and with a month in advance notice anywhere between 4-7 clerics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Binnamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Definitly get a solid tank. I probably could just *barely* tank him, (I belive I buff out at just over 6k now) but it would be a lot harder then a bigger tank, tanking him. <br />
<br />
Help your tank level up, try and help him get ND3, that will help a ton.<br />
<br />
<br />
Good luck dobbo, I can't really tank him, I just do pathetic dps ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>CyrzB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">We pull both to ME zoneline. I have no idea if this is hard, we just tell our monks do it and they do. Since none of them read this board, I can safely say we have an excellent pull team. Don't ever tell them I said that, Dovan/Trast!<br />
<br />
Shrink the MA, have him engage, and back into a corner. You end up with them jammed in the corner, back WIDE open, and pummeling the MA who is slightly more in the corner then he is.<br />
<br />
Last time I did DS, I started at a 4 sec rotation and widened it up a bit during the fight, then tightened it back down when defe wore off, but I'm 7500/1400, so YMMV. Thing I see with DS is his damage was very spikey.... cheals would land for 400, then the next for 5000, so be carefull when widening cheal rot. I don't know how much rotation was widened or tightened, I just send a tell to clerics to widen or tighten and they handle it.<br />
<br />
And yeah, we have the same thing, a monk wants RC's Tunic, and we do DS cause he's there (and that earring wouldn't be horrible...)</div></div><hr />
