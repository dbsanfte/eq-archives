<br />
How does it work?  Do you just keep killing all the mobs there over and over?  Is there a particular order?<br />
<br />
I want some Thurg armor for me and my Cleric partner, plus we need to work on our CoV faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ladiiesman</div><div class="date">05-10-2003, 01:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">got no info on the map location as i am too lazy to check it out...but.<br />
<br />
you kill the giants in the room with the big throne (4 guards, three up on dais = 7 total)<br />
<br />
then when you are ready, get up on the throne and say &quot;the dain must be slain for the peace we must obtain&quot;<br />
<br />
Doldigun Steinweilder(dorf) spawns.  hit him and he despawns and 2 waves of 2 giants spawn, once the second pair has died, three more giants spawn one after another.<br />
<br />
After the giants are dead, doldigun spawns again and runs...kill him and loot his head.  for the head to be useful to you you have to be the one who said the phrase to start the cycle.<br />
<br />
mob level?  the pairs are prolly level 52 or so, the three singles are all red to me at 53 and get tougher as they go.  only the last one enrages, offtanking it while my 2 grps killed the previous one with about 1120AC he was hitting for 100-200ish, not overly fast, was pretty easy once he was slowed.<br />
<br />
You could do the cycle with one group say a 58+ tank, a cleric and a slower plud dps.  no crowd control other than an offtank is needed, and i can do it easily at 53 with 4k hps and 1100ac.<br />
<br />
We always try to bring a second group for dps cause they do have a shitload of hps, specially the last dude.  Offtanking him solo I can get him to 98% then he regens to 100% :P<br />
<br />
Plate pieces drop off of any of the giants in the cycle. Just to be safe you can wait got the 7 repops each time b4 you start the cycle again but if you are oober, just keep running the cycle over and over and deal with repops when they happen :)  I dont remember the respawn time though (<br />
<br />
hope some of that helps</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arantius</div><div class="date">05-12-2003, 03:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been running the Kael plate cycle a bit with me and my ingame wife to equip our alts.  We both 2 box, 4 characters = owned plate cycle.  I'm 65 monk+63 druid she's 60 cleric+58 enc.<br />
<br />
First off, this is actually part of the coldain ring 9 quest.  If you complete the whole thing you'll be able to get the head of a dwarf that's part of the quest.<br />
<br />
The place: Yes, number 11 on EQAtlas.  Sometimes called Iceshard Keep because the Iceshard brothers spawn here on the &quot;throne&quot; who by the way drop the blood for shawl 7.<br />
The break in:  We go outside the keep, kill 1 wanderer and the 2 you can see.  Stand right at the wall you can see and you'll aggro one on the other side.  We kill these to be safe.  Heading left across where those two you killed before are you see a door, and a giant standing between two firepots, pull and kill it.  We then move in just past that spot to the giant standing by a table and kill it, and set up at the top of the stairs.  Pull and kill the 4 mobs along the sides of this room, and the 2 Iceshard brothers if they are up.  Iceshards have a long respawn (hours?) the rest have 20 minutes (I've read).<br />
The cycle:  When the room is empty, run up to the seat on the throne and say the keyphrase and a Coldain dwarf spawns.  Attack him (I believe you can only use melee and possibly spells, not ranged attacks like throwing weapons or arrows).  He will attack 1 round if you're in melee range and start the cycle.<br />
<br />
The fake log to illustrate the cycle:<br />
You say, 'the dain shall be slain for the peace we must obtain'<br />
Doldigun Steinwielder calls for help and scurries off<br />
You kick Doldigun Steinwielder for 63 points of damage.<br />
<br />
Grondon Zekkin says 'You have stuck yer nose where it don't belong fool, I'll show ya the error of yer ways!'<br />
Kromzog Zekkin says 'Your bones will be crushed by the Kromrif of Kael Drakkel!'<br />
<br />
You have slain Grondon Zekkin!<br />
Vinric Thunderclap says 'Your bones will be crushed by the Kromrif of Kael Drakkel!'<br />
You have slain Kromzog Zekkin!<br />
Zlirron Windchill says 'Your bones will be crushed by the Kromrif of Kael Drakkel!'<br />
<br />
You have slain Zlirron Windchill!<br />
Khalerogg Dorfenbane says 'Your bones will be crushed by the Kromrif of Kael Drakkel!'<br />
<br />
You have slain Khalerogg Dorfenbane!<br />
Valorankt Zekkin says 'Your bones will be crushed by the Kromrif of Kael Drakkel!'<br />
<br />
You have slain Valorankt Zekkin!<br />
Valorankt Zekkin's corpse shouts 'Doldigun, you have caused us too much trouble. You are no longer welcome here! Show yourself!'<br />
 <br />
<br />
The plain english explanation of the cycle with more details:  When you say the keyphrase, 'the dain shall be slain for the peace we must obtain' you spawn a dwarf.  Attack the dwarf and you set the cycle in motion.  Two giants spawn on the throne area, Grondon and Kromzog Zekkin.  These are normal looking giants in blue.  The blue giants here are low 50s in level and have by rough estimate about twice the hitpoints of any old giant around the bank area, in Grondon's case.  Kromzog has more.<br />
Kill Grondon first.  He's got less hitpoints and it is also important to keep track of the order you kill these mobs, why will become clear.  As soon as Grondon is dead, another giant will spawn back by the throne, Vinric Thunderclap.  He's bigger and badder, and he's wearing yellow instead of blue.  The yellow giants are mid 50s in level and have a good bit more HPs than the blue ones.<br />
At this point, I establish aggro on Vinric and he gets slowed, but we then set to getting rid of Kromzog.  When Kromzog is dead, another big bad yellow giant will spawn, Zlirron Windchill.  Kill Vinric first because when Zlirron dies, a third big bad yellow giant will spawn, Khalerogg Dorfenbane.  If you do this in the order suggested Khalerogg will be by himself.  When Khalerogg falls, the really big really bad Valorankt Zekkin will spawn.  He's the final giant in this chain, which is 2 at once, 2 more, 1 then 1.  He's around level 60, has something like 80 to 100 thousand hitpoints and is totally magic immune.  (Perhaps lures?  Nothing an enc, druid, or cleric has thrown at him has stuck and my procs are almost all resisted.)<br />
Finally, when Valorankt Zekkin dies, the little dorf will appear on the throne again and quickly try to scurry out.  See, he's the reason you're here and have been trashing the giant's party, and he's worn his welcome out.  Smoosh him if you can.  He's mid 50s in level and also magic immune.  Don't fear a bad coldain hit, there is no faction hit from him.  IF you successfully kill Doldigun, you may say the keyphrase and immediately begin the cycle again, though it would be a good idea to probably clear out the spawns in the room again first.<br />
The other stuff:  Good offtanking skills (because slow is your crowd control) and good healing is important here.  Then, just enough damage output to get the giants dead before you do.  All the giants will run under normal rules, so get them snared if you can.  The magic immune ones you can't, so they're fun to try to keep away from adds.  Any giant in the cycle can drop any piece of Corroded Plate armor for Thurgadin quests.  So far, we've gotten 3 arms, 2 legs, 1 boots, 1 helm.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />
