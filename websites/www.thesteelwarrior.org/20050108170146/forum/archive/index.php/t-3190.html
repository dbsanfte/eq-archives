<br />
Also, Guard III (the melee one) is interesting.... anyone know if it generates some aggro on a proc?<br />
<br />
I was considering adding one of these two procs to my Blackout... the other option being the ykesha proc.<br />
<br />
I know ykesha stun is good aggro, and plan to add that to my CHSD in main hand.  Was looking for an alternative for the offhand blackout that still gives some aggro, but also provides a little damage absorption.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flair</div><div class="date">09-26-2003, 12:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok I added a guard 2 to a weapon finally just to goof around with it, some obeservations:<br />
<br />
1. Subjective observation: there appears to be no agro component with this proc.  I saw no difference in MOB behaviour when this proc'd with myself not already having agro.<br />
<br />
2. Subjective observation: the mitigation from the proc buff appeared measureable (i.e it appears that it was a straight pct mitigation off each hit taken).  I did not parse it so I can't give you &quot;hard&quot; numbers....I eyeballed a stream of hits both with and without the proc up and saw a difference in damage taken.  Perhaps if I'm not too lazy I'll pull some parses down with and without the proc up.<br />
<br />
3.  Subjective observation: by all previous wording of this affect I would have expected it to mitigate a certain %damage until a cap is hit and then have the proc buff vanish.  During the fights in which I used the weapon with the proc I never lost the icon...makes me curious if there is a straight time duration  on the effect rather than a damage cap that it can take before dissipation (aka it doesn't appear to work like a rune).<br />
<br />
Ok these are straight up subjective observations...not empirical aka &quot;hard&quot;  but probably better than nothing (which exists to date on this subject here).  Take them with a grain of salt and if dissatisfied spend 500 pts and buy your own guard 2 to parse ;-)</div></div><hr />
