<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ratman3cureless</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wondering if anyone noticed an improvement in taunt after the last patch.<br />
<br />
I have never been one with huge aggro issues, and never really mash taunt in XP situations.  However, in a recent situation i was breaking a mez - thinking the mob had already been preslowed.  It had not however.  Sure enough, I  aoe taunt to get aggro, break mez, and about 2 seconds later slow lands (shamen slowing not chanter.)  I immediatly use taunt and mob rips right around to me.  This has NEVER happened in the 4 years i have been playing, as we all know.<br />
<br />
I have tested this further and have noticed a signifigant increase in the effectivness of taunt.  Was just wondering if anyone can confirm this of perhaps im dreaming.  As I said I've never been the sort to have aggro problems.  Would like to hear from someone that previsouly might have had aggro problems and doesnot any longer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bloodheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Question is, was it only for warriors, or all classes with taunt?<br />
<br />
Either way, welcomed change imo, taunt was shit and had seemingly no effect regardless.<br />
<br />
K enough late night ranting :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Has happened to me lots of times, you must be the most unlucky WAR in all of EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i could always get the mob to come on to me when slow lands with taunt, prob about 6-7 times out of 10. I just watch for the sham casting message and keep my hand hovering around my hotkey button for taunt and as soon  i see slow land i mash it.<br />
<br />
Have not had a chance to test out anything since patch but will see if theres any change tonight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rylaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">That happens to me in every exp group. Not on every mob. But fairly often. Slow lands, mob starts to make a break for the slower...I hit taunt and it usually (perhaps 60 % of the time ?) snaps right back onto me. I saw no change in taunt after the patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>ratman3cureless</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hrmmm - odd - as i said I don't usually have to use taunt much, but it seems when I do it never works like this.  Guess im off on this, thanks for the info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">check that your in range of the sham. i always stand right next to them with the sham at right angles to me so that as soon as the mob turns i know i lost aggro.<br />
<br />
also check your taunt skill is in line with your level, if not may need to do a bit of mashing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Fvighlander</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">For me, it always depends on how early the slower casts. If I've had 5 rounds or so of combat to build up some respectable aggro (or if I'm lucky enough to get a good proc in early), one taunt is all it takes to keep a mob on me after the slow. If they cast earlier, it's nearly always 2-3 taunts before I'm successful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Braeorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Like gulug, I always pull to shaman. I get the first hits in, and as soon as the mob yawns or I notice shammy has cast but get no msg, I smack taunt. 8/10 times I'd say the mob is on me. If it fails, I hit a macro key that looks like this:<br />
<br />
/assist<br />
/pause 2<br />
/shield<br />
/g Shielding %t<br />
/assist<br />
<br />
So I assist the mob, shield the shammy, assist the shammy so i'm back on the mob, and by this time I hit taunt again...<br />
<br />
Simple routine that'll keep yer slower happy and keep the group on trucking.<br />
<br />
Funny though, its still only as good as the group yer with, I had a wizard getting agg last night before slow was even cast, goddamnit, in the 60's theres no excuse for this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Byork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">You might also want to check your taunt in a different zone.<br />
<br />
It's been my experience that aggro on mobs in HoH is vastly different from mobs in the pit in Tactics.  HoH mobs turn back to me easily, Tactics mobs remind me of some insane tennis match.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Aveen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Last night in the ssra mines I saw no improvement with tunt  with any of the 100+ skellies I tanked.</div></div><hr />

The taunt skill doesn't work that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Taunt bumps you to the top of the aggro list + 1 point of aggro.<br />
(not 100% sure on how much aggro you get above list)<br />
<br />
So, either your taunt works and you get aggro,<br />
or it doesn't and you don't get aggro.<br />
<br />
Always been like that :p<br />
<br />
What sucks though, is you can easily get 4 failed Taunts, and during that time, everyone is yelling at you to taunt and saying how crap a warrior you are..<br />
woowoo..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Saw no discernible difference in taunt after patch.  It still works about as often as it should, which is enough but not enough when you really need it, but that's fine.</div></div><hr />
