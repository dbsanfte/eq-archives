<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ooka</div><div class="date">07-24-2004, 08:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have had some feedback lately from warriors on my server who are convinced that once they got WA5 their procs went DOWN (as compared to WA4). Has anyone else had this experience or do you suppose it's a perception?<br />
<br />
I am in process of saving for WA5 or Sturdiness3. I am a MT for a raid team (who are currently gearing toward MM, Bert, RZ targets) and hold pretty good aggro (with BoC and CHSD both anger augmented) but also play in xp groups daily (with Go4W with Ykesha augment). I am raid buffed to 9.1+. Your recommendation I assume would be Sturdiness3 first??<br />
<br />
Any input is welcomed. Thank you in advance.<br />

- Weapon augmentations will again proc properly</div></div><hr />

You can't see a difference in proc rate by watching your chat box.  Hell you can't even parse it in less than 4 hours.  If you suspect something is wrong, do a LONG parse.  Otherwise don't go spreading rumors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">07-26-2004, 12:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">but if it has needed a correction on test server the 20th, it's maybe because it's not acting as intended. So maybe it comes from  the last 19th patch. and if so it's still on live server.<br />
but this is jsut a rumor as &quot;if&quot; isn't reliable :) .</div></div><hr />

I was trying to ascertain information from people with similar AAs and class as myself. All above answered are duly noted and I thank you for your input.<br />
