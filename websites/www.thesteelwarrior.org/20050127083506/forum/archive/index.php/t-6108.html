<br />
First let me give you the setting and what rules were laid down before us.<br />
<br />
The melee event is to take place in the arena at Lake Rathe.  We are not allowed to step off the platform.  Doing so disqualifies us.<br />
<br />
The usage of DoT's, Shadowstepping, Invis is not allowed.<br />
<br />
The opponents is consisted of a full group<br />
<br />
65 Warrior<br />
65 ShadowKnight<br />
65 Shaman<br />
65 Wizard<br />
65 Wizard<br />
65 Cleric<br />
<br />
All of which have at least 200 AA points spent into their skills.<br />
<br />
The mission is to compile a team of at the most 8 people to kill them all.  Resources of people are roughly 2-3 of every class available (except bard and beastlord...not active enough for this)<br />
<br />
What I ask of you the reader of this as to what classes would you choose, and the tactic you would employ in defeating these 6.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Binnamar</div><div class="date">03-10-2004, 04:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">65 SK<br />
65 SK<br />
65 SK<br />
65 Pal<br />
65 war (you I'm assuming)<br />
65 shm<br />
65 bard<br />
65 wildcard (another healer would be good)<br />
<br />
<br />
That's what I'd go with.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for tactics...  Get the shaman killed asap, then the cleric. Providing your healers are still up, you should win!<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm no pvp expert though, so maybe someone will have better advice.<br />
<br />
*edit* Whatever levels you have are gonna have to work I guess.  But 65 all the way around will help immensly *edit*</div></div><hr />

However I am unable to use the bard due to the only one we have in guild is not on very often.  Thinkin I may use our highest level necro for that slot.  He gets some mean crits along with if we can kill the shaman off fast enough he can WTD her back in and use her against them.  Wonder if MindWrack works on PC's in a duel</div></div><hr />
