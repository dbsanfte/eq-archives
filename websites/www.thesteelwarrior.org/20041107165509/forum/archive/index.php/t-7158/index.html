<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Stealth travel is fairly good, defensive bonus helps somewhat and it will save you when your group leader is a idiot.<br />
<br />
Heard stanmia and arial S. is good,but dont you need hover to use arial S.?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Contrary to what the whiners may have you believe if you read the CoH boards ... Hasten is STILL an amazing power pool power.<br />
<br />
If you're a tanker, then Provoke is excessively overpowered.<br />
<br />
Stealth is great. A lot of people use it. I finally got it the other day and loved it, and am thinking of getting it on my scrapper, dipping into a third power pool for it.<br />
<br />
Stamina is great for a lot of different builds. It helps a lot. But requires high level, lots of slotting and good SO enhancements to be as effective as everyone likes to pretend it is when they get it. In other words, stamina requires a committment.<br />
<br />
Teleport Friend, Teleport Fore, ALL of the leadership buffs are all quite popular.<br />
<br />
Arial Superiority? I've no clue about. I guess it does add another melee attack to your repetoire. But not much in this game flies at the low levels.<br />
<br />
Combat Jumping is popular, due to a defense bonus. <br />
<br />
Some pool powers I think that get overlooked are:<br />
<br />
1- Tough<br />
2- Weave<br />
<br />
Defense boosts available to classes that can't actually get them, are something a lot of people are overlooking.<br />
<br />
3- Swift<br />
4- Hurdle<br />
<br />
The fitness line is really popular, but many people act like these powers are wasted, and only get them to open up stamina. When actually they're both quite effective.<br />
<br />
5- A pet peeve of mine. FLURRY. I love this power. Not many people like it, due to low damage. I, however, look at it as a time filler that does more damage than brawl. So I really like it and how it can help fill out a melee character's offensive arsenal.</div></div><hr />

Mob doesn't actually have to be flying for Arial Superiority to work.  Will land on walking targets too, just has the added affect of knocking a flying target to the ground.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm really finding that my biggest problem is by far stamina with my tanker.  And I'm torn, I find that I fight yellows a lot and miss a fair amount, even with a DO accuracy slot on all my offensive powers.  And I've got 2 DO slots on two out of the three offensive powers and one on the third, yet my stamina still plumets.  I don't feel like I can give up the accuracy, or the one damage slot on each offensive power, yet the two endurance reductions just aren't helping that much.<br />
<br />
But stamina is a hell of a slot commitment as well.  Any suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">That's a tough one. I mean, END drain is something we all fight. And if you're using END reducers and still having the trouble, then your only recourse is to committ to Stamina. Tankers really go for it a lot, so you won't be doing anything all that radical. Swift/Hurdle/Health are all ok effects, so you won't be WASTING powers.<br />
<br />
I personally like Swift/Hurdle a lot. So I've never had a problem committing to the stamina pool. <br />
