<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xarim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok I have a question about the guild I am in. I am the raid leader so I organize all the raids etc. We can usually field about 30 people 60-65 for raids. With about 4 clerics and plenty of everything else. We can take down PoI dragon with np and mujaki etc. Are there any other planes mobs we can kill with this force for flagging purposes? Any feedback at all would be helpful, thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Roshinbertson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">you should be able to take down PoI dragon no problem.  Your first couple times maybe a little rough until you get use to him.<br />
<br />
<br />
i'm sure you can do BoT mini lords for bot key.   <br />
<br />
PoJ trials 8)~....<br />
<br />
not sure about the rest...they may be a little rough</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">LOL rosh he already said he can take POI dragon.<br />
<br />
Try doing Gryme first in POD, then move down to Spider and Grummus.<br />
<br />
You can try the Caprin Cycle in CoD.<br />
<br />
You can definitely try Terris Thule, Especially if you have a few MGB'rs and Good Off-tanks and Mezzers.<br />
<br />
Magnetic Behemoth in PoI is going to take more people than you have unfortunately.<br />
<br />
Aerin Dar will eat you with the adds.<br />
<br />
That is about it for now. Remember you need lots of CC, a strong MA, some good off-tanking, and above all else DPS to win in PoP.<br />
<br />
Unless you are going to recruit, focus on getting good agro weapons and lots of DPS for your members.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xarim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks alot for the responses. I have already taken down gryme and spider, just not grummus. as for AD, i figure since we have 3+ bards, maybe we could highsun the adds back to spawn point where they wont aggro and keep doing that. Then just take them out 1 by 1 when AD dies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Roshinbertson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">doh sorry didn't see the WE in front of can</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Xarim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">So would the highsun method work or would the adds just come back again?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ronaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">you can just have snarers kite them around (re: AD)<br />
<br />
if you're not going to recruit, that raid size is about perrrrrfect for some Ssra Temple Sssnake Loving, in my opinion.<br />
<br />
PoP, you won't find much entertaining except what has been mentioned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Xarim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The guild has alot of probelms recruiting because we are based in Europe and raid on those time frames. It hurts us alot, and our guild leader has recently pretty much quit in favor of SWG. So I have been doing my best to keep raids going and recruiting etc up to date. Takes a toll having to be an officer and do so much. Leading raids etc takes most of my time, and I still havent gotten crap for AA or level 65, and at this rate I never will. Ssra is what I have been researching for some possible trips there, but we lack an active rogue amongst other things to open some doors. Suppose we can explore the basement. Another thing I have been doing is researching more Luclin era mobs because I think we can take most of those with np.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ronaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">oh i see.<br />
<br />
in that case, Doomshade / Rumblecrush.<br />
might as well try velious. Vindicator / Dain are pretty doable (faction issues for dain though most likely), as are Velketor and his buddy Lord Alphabetsoup.<br />
Zlandicar comes to mind as well. haste hats for your melees and z-hearts for your necros ;)<br />
oh, and if you kill Vindicator. kill statue too. might be a lengthy fight but it's slowable so IMO easier than vindicator.<br />
<br />
have you considered ToV -HoT raids to gear up? no single big targets for uber loots, but still nice stuff to fill out equipment slots for many classes, and hey you might even farm dozekar for quests (still pretty uber items)<br />
<br />
in Luclin, the Va'Dyn, the Itraer Vius, and maybe Shei Vinitras too, are other targets you could focus on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Xarim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thanks alot. We stopped doin Vindi way back when because he was kinda boring and no real upgrades for anyone anymore. Guess we just stick to the small stuff for now hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kirle1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Shei might be a stretch but the again I havn't done that fight in months so... you'll have to try it first to find out.  I'd also recoment Grieg, and taking a stab at various other luclin bosses, the lesser named in Ssra can be fun, Rhag 1 Rhag 2, and AL.  And if you can get to the basement, Cursed Cycle, although the final mob might be a little past you just yet.  ToV is a great way to go Doze quests will give you nice gear, and then you can begin the progression through there, once your done, start killing the various Velious Kings, and make your way to WToV, Also you're at the size were certainly you might look at possibly being ablt to get a few ST keys in the guild.  You can Especially do this if you're killing Statue, Lendi, Zlandicar, on any regularity.  ST will provide you guys with alot of upgrades, as well as the added DPS to potentially do encounters with your small numbers that might not be possible without primal/prismatic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Honestly...<br />
<br />
To make a really long post really short, you can:<br />
<br />
1. Start working on Ssra and VT.<br />
<br />
2. Start doing LDoN exclusively to upgrade your BPs and Legs.<br />
<br />
3. Team up with another guild and get access to everything but Rallos Zek.<br />
<br />
4. Mix in upgrade raids with a lot of LDoN if your people need AA's or Levels anyway.<br />
<br />
5. Recruit about 10-20 more people.<br />
<br />
Details to follow:<br />
<br />
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br />
<br />
Option 1. If you have that many people with lots of DPS, and a bad ass tank or two, your next move is probably to get into VT.<br />
<br />
Some guilds can skip VT on the basis of pure numbers. You will most likely not be able to do this.<br />
<br />
If you want to keep it small and tight, have people learning the Ssra mobs and getting VT keys. You could definitely use 2 more clerics.<br />
<br />
If you can get it to yourself, it will yield similar or better upgrades for the time spent, but with LDoN you can do the whole guild at once with no competition, and the items will serve you until you are actually killing the elemental gods. If you get one ssra mob a week, then you will not be able to get the same bang for the buck.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Option 2. You could have everyone doing LDoN full time, 4 or 5 adventures a day for the next two-three-four months.<br />
<br />
At that point you would have a BP and Legs with FT 4 for the casters or +120 hp upgrades for the melee on each slot.<br />
<br />
2984 points for armor, 2300 for the caster upgrades and 6900 for the melee upgrades...The other benefit of course being the extra AA exp you can generate.<br />
<br />
P.S. Getting BP and Legs to Elemental Level with Augmentations is the best bang for the buck, due to the rarity of those pieces even after you gain access.<br />
<br />
Look at some of the threads around here about rarity of various slots/class type armor and try and make sure people are filling out with those things first from LDoN.<br />
<br />
At that pace, in 3-4 months all your plate classes would have 220 hp BP's, 200 hp Greaves...and they will have generated on average another 70 or so AA's.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Option 3. You are going to hit a wall in flagging purposes twice no matter what you do with that many people.<br />
<br />
1. Rallos Zek (the adds will wreck you due to lack of DPS)<br />
2. Rydda Dar (the Max hit streakiness means loss of DPS at some point, and you won't be able to catch up when the MA and TA go down)<br />
<br />
Xarim, my honest advice to you for flags is to team up with some other people to your mutual benefit.<br />
<br />
If you just want flags and are not concerned about keeping the loot in the family, then either grab a comparable guild, or host a 72man open raid like we do on Drinal.<br />
<br />
You can easily take down Saryrn with this method. <br />
<br />
Same with Terris Thule.<br />
<br />
Behemoth is a little harder but with 72 Level 65's you should have no problem.<br />
<br />
Aerin Dar is a Snap if people use their heads.<br />
<br />
The first two Trials in HoH are easy as well.<br />
<br />
Rydda Dar is just a matter of keeping that MA up for as long as possible to keep the MAX amount of dps on him. I beat him in early PoP with a pickup raid (but had 96 people at the time - avg level 63 though :p )<br />
 <br />
Caprin cycle will always be tough to accomplish with Open raids due to the fact that every person that dies forms another add, but it is doable.<br />
<br />
Drinal has done Mith Marr with pick-up raids before as well. If you have Bards and an MA with high hps, plus plenty of clerics, you can do MM.<br />
<br />
So look into teaming up with another guild or group. With 4 clerics, a strong MA, and some bards/chanters/kiters, you will definitely hold up your side of the bargain.<br />
<br />
The best part is that you can plan this twice a week and have people working on LDoN the other 5.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Option 4. Faster than all of this of course, and the bane of all fun family guilds anywhere, is just to recruit about 6 more clerics and 18 more rangers and Wizards and Mages.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Xarim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Yeah working on all of that. Our guild doesnt want to ally with another guild, for loot purposes. And recruiting is slow because the Euro time. But I have been trying to focus more on luclin to upgrade us a bit and get us ready for some bigger mobs. Other then that thanks for all of the advice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ygnir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I'm sorry, but for a 30 sized raidforce VT is way out of reach. <br />
<br />
<br />
My advice would be to farm the BoT tower bosses silly... they pop every 6 hours and allow you to give all your melee's 41/31 2hb's, your tanks and clerics Ornate Bp's, Ft2 hats for the wis casters, Chain Bp's, Leather Bp's etc etc etc. Incredible reward, mobs are always up, good training in various tactics (several AE's to work out, etc)<br />
<br />
This will be easyer and give your guild more power then doing NtoV.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Xarim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Ok we took down Rumblecrush last night. Pretty damn easy. Could anyone else offer any other noteworthy mobs in Luclin to take down? We farm Katta regularly, Doomshade, and now RC. But what about zones like AC and AR. Would they be to hard to kill the nameds for loot? And what about The deep? Anything there worth killing? I use this for raid purposes.  Loot page  (http://www.darkwind-guild.com/SoL/) Trying to find some mobs that are within our capabilities atm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Marshall Earp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">You don't need MGB for Terris Thule.  When it gets close to the debuff, just have everyone but the warrior and a couple clerics move out of the lair.  Then run back in and buff those three (have them in the same group) quickly as all hell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Xarim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Yes. But Could anyone shed some light on luclin? I been in and around all the zones, but I havent fought lots of the raid mobs within it. Maybe 3-4 at best. And those are easy now, the harder ones are the ones that have me worried.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Crayno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Grieg is a &quot;fun&quot; fight and has some nice loot.<br />
Might wanna check on IV too.<br />
Try Burrower in the Deep.<br />
Give AOW a shot.<br />
Don't be afraid to wipe,learn for your mistakes and have faith in your skills.<br />
Ygnir is a friend of mine but I disagree with him that VT can't be reached by a 30ish raidforce</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Burrower<br />
Shei<br />
IV<br />
XTC<br />
Rhag Cycle<br />
Glyphed Cycle<br />
HP<br />
<br />
Thsoe should all be doable for you. You'll probably fail cursed cycle a few times though. After gearing up in Ssra, hit the emperor and then on to Vex Thall. Seru shouldn't be too hard for you either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Xarim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Thanks raaj. Going to try TT this weekend if she is up. I think as long as everyone listens to me she should go down relatively easy. Hope everyone shows up to make it possible. If not guess we are off to Luclin! Thx for all the help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Xarim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Well to make things easier on us all Xanamech finally dropped CHSD. So now my life as MT just got a little easier :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Togr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">For Velius keep hitting King Tormax and Statue until you can take down Avatar of War.  Also think about Sleepers Tomb, rarely raided anymore and good for those low turnout nights (20some people), plus if you spend a whole night there you could get almost everyone an upgrade.<br />
<br />
Luclin the Itraer Vius will help you build up FT with you eventually taking down Burrower, Shei, Grieg, and the Ssra mobs (you should have plenty of access to ssra mobs due to your time zone)<br />
<br />
Planes you should keep farming xana for the haste neck and agro hammer for your tanks.  Also farm either the BoT tower bosses or go to PoS and kill named/lords to get your runes started.  Work on the grummus and Terris Thule events.  Once you get grummus you can kill Paffa and attempt HP Cycles.  Also work on the HoH Trials, while you can't do the dragon you can get some loot and get a chunk of that flagging out of the way.  Just make sure that once you beat an encounter you can keep your people logging in to do it over and over to get the flags you need since with your numbers you wont' be able to piggyback much.<br />
<br />
Also, as MT for your guild the number one thing you can do is crank out those AAs.   The DEF aa's will make a considerable difference to your healers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Xarim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Wow thanks for those awesome tips. Those will make things alot easier in deciding what to raid each night. And yes I do need to crank out more aa's, and have been working on it. Just seems to go so much slower now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>wudedorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">One item of note if plan on doing IV make sure you have at least 2 GRC casters available, that blind is a sob and on almost constantly(make sure you as MT position yourself well so to not get knocked around into adds). Grieg has same problem with the blind but seems to cast it not as frequently, I swear I spend 90% of IV fight blinded with druids casting spam GRC on me, take avg of 2 hits from IV to reblind me.<br />
BP is a fun event but need to make sure you have 6 decent melees with enough healing for them as well as enough dps to kill all in early waves prior to next wave, while still having enough healling to kill a wormy version of AoW(imo not as many hps or as spikey damage from him).<br />
Cursed if have solid strat you can do him with those numbers(our guild killed him 1st try for kicks with 30 people, 1 cleric who was being 3 boxed).<br />
Do not be afrid to try things others say you cant win at, worst case you lose and have to CR, best case you win and get loot &amp; a sense of accomplishment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Bumamgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I see a lot of people posting what you &quot;can't do&quot; with a 30 man raid force and four clerics.<br />
<br />
Let me tell you what you CAN do:<br />
Luclin: Cursed (24 ppl), XTC (16 ppl), Emperor Ssra (34 ppl), Aten Ha Ra (26 ppl)<br />
PoP: Aerin`Dar (40 ppl), Grummus (40 ppl *overkill*), Terris Thule (36 ppl),  Manaetic Behemoth (31 ppl)<br />
<br />
Our force is wearing top end Velious gear with a good mix of Ssra and VT pieces added in (most of our members have 2 VT items)<br />
<br />
If you haven't farmed NToV, AoW, Tunare and other end game Velious bosses, I recommend it.  Then move on to Ssra named farming, throwing in a Burrower Parasite kill here and there.<br />
<br />
I strongly recommend you go the Vex Thal route, as the gear obtained there will make it much easier to progress through PoP with a smaller force.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">How do you do Behemoth with 31 people?<br />
<br />
Maximum of 27 people if you could CC 4 rooms with one person each?<br />
<br />
Make that 23 if you happen to use a whopping 2 people per room to CC or kill?<br />
<br />
Did something change in this fight?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Kirle1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">You CC the 4 rooms?  innefficiant only need CC in 2 spots for the MB fight, we've done him with around 30 before....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Grobble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Xanamech/BoT towers should definitely be your NToV in pop.  Haste and Aggro weapons from the dragon, all kinds of useful stuff from the towers (good aggro 1hs, FT hats for priests, Ornate chest pieces, runes etc...).<br />
<br />
If you're skeptical about doing the VT thing, try Seru instead.  30 people can do him, no need to farm bane, not everyone needs a key.  Much less of a timesink and still great loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Back in the day, if you CC'd in the two hallways, MB would warp around and kill those people before you could engage him...<br />
<br />
Glad to see things have changed :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Bumamgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Stick a kiter in each of the four corner rooms, kite all the spiders around in that room, and you don't even need enchies.<br />
<br />
We did have one enchie at each door just in case a spider slipped past a kiter.<br />
<br />
We only had one spider get through to the enchanter, who, of course, had no problem mezzing it in the hallway long before it got close to the doors.<br />
<br />
So you end up with 6 people on CC duty, and the rest of the raid on MB.  Anyone can be a kiter, we used a grab bag: shammy, SK, monk or two.  We tried using Druids, but our druids can't seem to figure out how to kite :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Zebedi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">You should seriously consider hitting Ssra hardcore.<br />
<br />
For one thing, it's a loot intensive zone, 90% of which will be an upgrade for everyone in your guild.<br />
<br />
For another, when people see that you're gearing up in SSRA, you'll find yourself suddenly getting recruits comming out of the woodwork.<br />
<br />
Some items off the top of my head that are good for warriors..<br />
Bloodfrenzy- best 1h EB weapon in the game, drops off Cursed.<br />
Hategiver- another EB weapon, drops off a much easier mob.<br />
Blackout- Drops from HP, DD+stun proc and a great ratio, it's better aggro than a CHSD.<br />
Ring of the Shissar- 80hp ring with 4sta and some other stats<br />
Breastplate of the Void- 110hp 65ac BP with an awesome effect.<br />
Ivory Crystal Legs- 80hp 48ac from high priest too<br />
<br />
That's just a quick sample, there is TONS of loot in this zone.</div></div><hr />
