<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gnomos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Can someone give me a clear sequence of events, with complete mob names, for this ring?  I'm trying to write it up clearly for my guild, but even though we did it once, I'm fuzzy on the specific progression.<br />
<br />
The Pyramid starts out with the following mobs:<br />
2 Stone Abominations at the base of each side<br />
<br />
2 A Crumbling Stone Mass at top of East side<br />
2 A Rock Creation at top of north side<br />
2 A Pile of Boulders  at top of South side<br />
2 A Boulder Thrower at top of west side<br />
<br />
1 untargetable mob in top middle.<br />
<br />
Killing these mobs in some order spawns stone fortifications.<br />
<br />
A Stone Fortification - about 40 of these get cleared early on, what pops them?<br />
<br />
A Stone Monstrosity - this guys gets popped by something, has loads of hp.  When he dies, peregrin Rockskull pops, but isn't targetable yet.<br />
<br />
Kill 20(?) A Stone Heaps<br />
<br />
A Mound of Rubble - I think there are 4 of these that pop with Peregrin.  You beat them down to 0, they heal up and go back.  When all have been done, then peregrin can be killed.<br />
<br />
Peregrin Rockskull (An Encrusted Dirt Cloud is non-loot version)<br />
<br />
Some other rock mobs, where do they fit in?<br />
<br />
A Towering Rock Formation</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bulbog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Kill the yellow cons at the top spawns the blue cons.  5 waves of the blue cons, very easy.  Mini named then spawns, it may charge your camp I forget, really it's harder than peregrin, has decent hp.  Then 5 more waves of blue cons this time they charge your camp.  4 red cons spawn, bring them down to 10% and they auto regen and run away back onto the pyramid.  Peregrin then charges your camp after the 4 are killed and back up on the pryamid.  There's a bug where you can accidentally kill the red cons if you're not careful which bugs the event.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">the one time we did it once we got all the 4 red cons to die or whatever and become targetable, peregrin's PHer ran at us. when we killed that then peregrin spawned untargetable in the middle and we had to kill a ton more of the weak blue ones before he spawned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Haladan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">After you beat down the last Mound of rubble(making it return to temple), a Rock Monstrosity will spawn.  And he will come running to you asap.  Hits for the same as Perigrin R. So be ready for him.  After he die,  you get the stone heaps auto pulling in packs of 4 or 5.  When you have killed enough spawns of these, Perigrin spawn and auto pulls(charges raid), if you get PH he will stay at temple. If you need a break between Rock Monstrosity and Perigrin, just mez one of the stone heaps til you are ready again.<br />

Haladan</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bulbog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Oops yeah got the order mixed up.  Really it's easy as hell though, nothing you can't figure out by just doing it heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Raunstonecutter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Just have your pullers keep training the raid =)  Eventually the boss will come for ya =)<br />
<br />
Its a fun ring =)  Lots of insanity (though controlled he he)</div></div><hr />
