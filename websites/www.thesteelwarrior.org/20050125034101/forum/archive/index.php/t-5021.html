I know levels will help and my group is working on that slowly. I am not guilded so anything I can get is LDoN and very slow at that or bazaar bought. I know the weapons I have are good but I never seen satasfied with what I have and I am always looking for ways to improve them. I am trying to save for anger II augments for the 1 handers and an anger III for the GSoT but that is taking forever.<br />

::::: EDIT :::::: noticed it still says i was in a guild that i have not been in in months.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ealsur Helevorn</div><div class="date">01-01-2004, 06:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I might be a tad confused, but on the first line, you ask what to get to increase DPS, and then you say you are auging your weapons with Anger procs, but Anger procs are for agro, I dont see how that will increase your DPS.<br />
If you want a DPS increase, you can a) Get other weapons b) Get Offensive AAs.<br />
If you choose a) I would say a War Marshall Bladed Staff. If you choose b) You will have to wait till you are higher in lvls, but Ferocity and Tactical Mastery gave me a nice DPS increase :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sisthar</div><div class="date">01-01-2004, 07:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a WMBS in the bank and really do not notice it even able to compare to my current weapons for agro or DPS. As for AA's i am working on them too and they are not all that hard to get it seems. I will be working on the for a bit until I get my shaman cought up to me in levels while PLing the shaman then will get more levels for my warrior. As for augments, I really want the anger II for agro but was looking for any other toughts for increasing my DPS and agro if able for a character that basicly has access to bazaar things only. I do not plan to buy a BoC or anything that is stupidly priced for 400K+ but I would like to see if there is anything else I can look for. I thought about a SBoD but it has the same damage delay as my off hand and no proc just a few more stats and more HP. Nice but they are over 100K on my server and I am not willing to even concider paying that for a few more stats and hp and loose the proc/stun i already have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ealsur Helevorn</div><div class="date">01-02-2004, 10:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The WMBS has better ratio than the GSoT (31/28 vs 31/30), so, it should be better DPS (I didnt parse it, I simply dont parse, but it felt like that).<br />
If you want both agro and a bit increase in DPS, the Ykesha line has a DD+stun, so, the DD, when it lands, should be some increase in damage.<br />
And imo, I would never get a SBoD just cause.... its ugly as sin :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ghazad</div><div class="date">01-02-2004, 05:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Like other people have mentioned WMBS is the best DPS you can buy for pp. Slap a DD aug on it and use that for DPS. Use your 1h setup for agro and get anger 2 for each of them as you progress in LDON (yeah, yeah, anger 3 is better but costs a lot of points)<br />
<br />
For an unguilded warrior at your level there is no way you can do better. If you really want DPS the best you can do is try and get an open raid on BoT Tower named mobs (if you are even flagged for BoT) to snatch up a Greatstaff of the four winds - kickass DPS and I doubt a 1hs setup exists that will out-dps it. (It drops off Auflife Chaoswind and its pretty common)<br />
<br />
Good luck to you sir,<br />
