<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Konk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">First post here all, I just started this war about a month ago and am really into it.  I 4 box 65 cleric, 65 shaman, 65 druid (all of which I've started myself) which is how I farm for pp.  Cleric and shaman are sol ro enabled.<br />
<br />
Anyway, here is my magelo Inspect Konker (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=995067)  Yea yea its got good stuff but, am i missing something.  To be honest I dont feel like dropin any more cash on this toon since I worked so hard for the last 4 years to come up with it.  BUT, it means a lot to me that he rocks later on in life and the thing is he's not going to be in my normal guild, he's a twink tank for a RL buddies guild that needs the help at War.  Any advice is appreciated and thanks for taking the time to check this out.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sindael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Gotta get better arms. 16 ac is horrible, especially in comparison to the rest. I know you said you didnt want to drop more plat on him, but I dont really know how much &quot;more&quot; is considering what else he is wearing. Ornate arms are only 40k now on Karana, not sure what the prices look like where you are at though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Konk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Aye, I've been searching for arms for the longest time but cant find any that I like.  I have a pair of the spiked elbow ones but imo they suck for a war.  Guess I can hold out till 55 and get ornate arms, i already have ornate bp mold in the bank from BoT tower raid.  Any suggestions on better ones he can use till then?  Also, Im lookin for some wrist suggestions.  I got a mana threaded bracer that my cleric used a while back but I dont see it as sufficient for a war.  Any help is appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">dump the long sword of the ykesha and get a CHoS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>KunabKB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You have two toons enabled for Sol Ro. Farm there to get arms, and a couple bracers. If they don't drop you can roll on other stuff (depending on group loot rules) and sell them to make money to buy that stuff.<br />
<br />
LDoN is good for anger augs, and HP augs as well as extra stat augs. Even gear upgrades if you'd rather spend time than money. <br />
<br />
You're going to get more HP as you level, and I assume you'll dump some AA into ND3, PE, etc. <br />
<br />
It really depends on how much time you want to spend farming Sol Ro. I farmed a lot for my rogue, not necessarily chain dropped but if someone didn't need the drop we'd greed roll for it. Can make good money to put towards upgrades you'd want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fynepisa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Most of the stuff to upgrade at this point will cost a lot of plat.<br />
<br />
Bracers:<br />
Crystallized Acid Bracer<br />
Mana-Threaded<br />
<br />
Belt:<br />
Belt of Raging Nature<br />
Heavy Rubicite Girdle (and swap in CoF for back)<br />
Fabled FBSS<br />
<br />
Mask;<br />
Thulian Visage of Horror<br />
Amygdalan's Chain Mask<br />
<br />
Arms:<br />
There are some arms from Umbral with cihiton in their namethat are decent until you can do ornate. 25ac 50hp and some other stuff.<br />
<br />
Weapon:<br />
SoD<br />
CHoS<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
That's about it for non level restricted stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">if you dont wanna burn lots of cash just fill out what slots are upgradable  with  cultural heraldic.<br />
<br />
face mask of frozen mana to get some hps on your face<br />
CHos offhand instead of gimpy/gay yak</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Konk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hmm... I have warlord's gauntlets that my cleric used to use, mana threaded bracer, I'll look into the Crystallized Acid Bracer... have cloak of flames in the bank and have Amy mask on my ranger.  So, I guess I need to pick up a cool belt and CHoS.  I think I got one on my trader from droga but not sure.  I can at least farm that.  I'll just haul to 55 and use ornate I guess.. and I can farm sol ro for pp if needed, but i got plenty enough left to drop another 100k on him if i needed too.  Too bad the fabled stuff is over (at least thats what i've heard.)  As for the SoD, im not such a fan of it, no proc and doesnt hold a candle to the BoC that I have.  Two procing weaps will be great.  Thanks all for the advice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You didn't say how much LDoN you do, but you might consider getting an LDoN BP instead of the ornate. You end up with more AC and the possibility of a ton more HP if you get the right augs. Other than that, everything else seems to have been covered.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grud</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">As for the SoD, im not such a fan of it, no proc and doesnt hold a candle to the BoC that I have. Sceptre of Destruction (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=1154), not Splitblade of Destruction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Konk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Ahh SoD heh ok.  I have access to one from a friend of mine but they run like 800k on The Nameless which is retarded.  The 288dd + stun is nice.  I'll see If I can use that for a while then also, good call.  I do ldon's a fair amount.  Only hard ones since before the mission I Fo7 and V myself and group.  Usually pretty easy but I know that the hard wont be something I can continue to do post 60 (as i would take an as$ beatin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Alisdahre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'd get different bracers before new arms.  16AC may be small, but at least they have STA and HPs.  Neither of the bracers have either stat, on top of their AC also being kinda low.<br />
<br />
I'd throw that Cloak of Flames you have on, and pick up nice HP belt.  You'll lose 20STA, but it looks like you'll still be maxed at 255STA even then.  So whatever HPs a good belt has will only add to you, since you'll be only dropping STA you're not using currently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jaqyl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Get your warrior to 60 and you can upgrade his face and arms very easily.<br />
<br />
The Sludge-Eating Fly (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=14230) in the GoD instanced zone Sewers of Nihilia - Lair of Trapped Ones, can drop Stonemite Carapace Mask (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68498) and Pitted Vambraces (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68492), and can spawn within the very first room of the zone, very easy to farm and will drop spells for your other toons as well.  Need to be 60 to zone in though, and you'll probably need around that level for your warrior to tank this, though with the slows and all the healing your other toons provide he should be fine once he's 60.<br />
<br />
GoD really presents alot of good upgrade options for skilled single groups.  If you can get a chanter's help Vxed is a great source of gear, the easiest mob in the zone to pull and kill Chavoor the Trickster (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=14588) drops very nice legs and earring for minimal effort, though you'd probably want your warrior to be 65 with most of his hp AA's for Vxed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>zito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">As a cheap upgrade, as other ppl mentioned, get cultural arms and bracers.  Also, tribute haste is pretty cheap; get a heavy rubicite girdle, and use the tribute haste.  As others have also said, ditch the LSoY, and get a CHoS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>irmingnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Man your gear makes mine look like the newbie quested gear =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Lorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Get Fierce Heraldic Arms, Bracer, and Mask.  Doesnt cost too much and are nice improvements.  I would swap out that RBB for a Soulscream Belt.<br />
<br />
Then just lvl lvl lvl.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Lorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Man your gear makes mine look like the newbie quested gear =/<br />
<br />
I think thats the point of this post anyways, to show off some gear.   :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Konk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">actually its really not to show off anything.  I sincerely want to make this guy right, as for fun, this toon maybe the the funnest I have.  So to show off... nah, i really wanted advice and im following it.  As for the gear, we all know that if you have toons high enough with access to the right places then pp isnt really an object, and when you've been playing for so many years, ya kinda know how to make it.  Anyway, I really appreciate all of the replies to this post.  I am camping a CoHS and I am going to use amy mask at 51 and have Heavy rub girdle.  I used CoF from trader.  Am still looking for the crystallized acid bracer and used the old Mana-threaded one from my cleric.  As far as arms go, im just going to get to 55 and use ornate that I won last night.<br />
<br />
Again, thank you all very much, I do appreciate it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>BabaHanz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Another good FREE mask if you want to spend the time would be the Eyepatch of Plunder.  Belt I'd go down to guk and farm the fabled FBSS, and while you're there, snatch a fabled SSoY to replace your offhand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">they killed fabled last night.  wish i had my ffbss .. but glad i got a chance to loot a fabled exe axe just for shits and giggles</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I thought that the fabled thing was overwith...?  If not cool maybe ill head down there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Sindael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">i think he means they killed the fabled spawns, as in they are no longer around</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Pumilio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">yeah get the fierce heraldic pieces for the slots that stink now.  then you're really golden for a long time.  until ornate slots or better (don't go for ornate bracers)<br />
<br />
Also thulian visage of horror was most likely a answer from someone looking in allakzams equipment search for none no drop gear.<br />
<br />
I have killed the dragon that drops it  13 times now and no mask yet.  I know it has a good rarity.  <br />
<br />
if you can find one for sale though, buy it even if it's 300k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Evariste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Lose the mask. You already have See Invisible on the Helm of Rallos Zek; pick up a Grimling Contraption or a Amygdalian Chain Mask instead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">i believe there are better crafted arms (not the deity ones) which are just below the elemental crafted ones. a friend made a pair for an alt of mine but i dont have the name offhand. ill dig it up and post it tonight when i get back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Konk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">i believe there are better crafted arms (not the deity ones) which are just below the elemental crafted ones. <br />
<br />
Hmm, maybe Livestone or Farwater... not sure if thats what you mean.  I never see Farwater anymore though.  I looked up that horror mask from CT, im going to try and live there for a few days and see If I can get any of this stuff to drop.  Same goes with the crystallized acid bracer.  The mob is lvl 65 blob but really he's not so hard, just lotta hps for one group.</div></div><hr />
