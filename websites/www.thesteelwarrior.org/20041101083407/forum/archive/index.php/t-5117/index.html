No bloodfrenzy for our tanks.<br />
<br />
No FANGS either.<br />
<br />
I hate that snake. With a passion.</div></div><hr />

IMHO cursed should drop a Bloodfrenzy every time for 2 years. Then maybe warriors will have some weapon balance vs. other classes ( like pally/Sk whose SSRA weapons drop all the time )<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wulfran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">0-6 on BF from Cursed<br />
1-8 on HG from XTC<br />
2-9 on BoC from AoW<br />
<br />
please tell me RZTW isn't this bad...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Warfust</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">No, it is worse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">From rztw to rz in time it only gets worse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gnomercy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">In the last few months while tooling around in SSRA Vt and backflagging we have are 1 for 11 on BF --- 0 for 10+ on hatebringer---- 4 of 5 on BoC(2 one kill)---- 2 of 3 on BoW so im hoping our BoW luck continues seeing how we got the saft in SSRA.  I was givin the option of returning my BoC to guild for DKP spent when i got first BoW which of course i did :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kendolekk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">My guild is...<br />
<br />
2-6 on Bloodfrenzies.<br />
1-11(not sure on number of kills) on HG<br />
5-8 on BoC's<br />
<br />
On a side not, we have also seen 2x Khalshazar and 1x Fangs I believe, from Cursed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">On a related note my guild probably killed 25-30 creators without seeing a single hategiver, since then we have gotten  3 hategivers from the last 5 creators.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Hyardgune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well, looking around my server, it seems like entry into an Elemental guild pretty much means a free BoW, they all seem to have the bloody things.  Doesn't stop the Elemental guilds from bottom feeding any Velious and Ssra mobs they can find though.<br />
<br />
So far, my guild is<br />
1-2 HG<br />
0-6 BoC<br />
never had a sniff at Cursed<br />
will likely be months before we even get in the same room as RZtW</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">&quot;will likely be months before we even get in the same room as RZtW&quot;<br />
<br />
All you need is tactics access.<br />
<br />
Then jump in the pit. Now you're in the same room with him.<br />
<br />
;-)<br />
<br />
I know, not what you meant, but still ... I'm laughing at my own joke.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Brokkah Narrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Hmm<br />
<br />
3-15ish on Bloodfrenzy<br />
1-4 on Hategiver<br />
12+ BoCs from about same number of kills (lost track now)<br />
2-5 BoWs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">It's random people.  In my first guild, we got 2 Bloodfrenzies, zero fangs, and 9 goldenrods in 17 kills.  In my current guild, every warrior has a bloodfrenzy, we had 4 drop in 5 kills once, but we only have like 3 goldenrods in the guild.  Just plain old random.  There are no rare drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kilzalot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">My guild has shit luck when it comes to War weaps... maybe I'm cursed ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mot sure about the war weapons but we kill ssra mobs as we can/they pop and we have had 0 Goldenrods, and atleast 2 BF's.  As far as the other pal/sk usable weapons we did get a fucktonne of emp swords, but dick all for the rest.<br />
<br />
I am all for you suggestion of that bastard dropping BF's everytime though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Dokor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">0-8 on bloodfrenzy<br />
3-30ish on hategiver<br />
i lost count on BoC at around 10 in 7 or 8 kill<br />
<br />
We are probably the only one guild of my server that does cursed to have more HG then BF ^^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">if a bloodfrenzy dropped every kill then the elemental guilds on bertoxx would kill cursed even more than they do now</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Zynth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">XtC is the absolute worst, i've never seen him drop a hategiver in over 20 kills, i dont even know someone with a hategiver. cursed we got 2 BFs in i think around 5 or 6 kills, one of which i own :D  and AoW we once had 3 BoC's in one kill, then the next time he dropped 3 rings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Jarelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">For my guild on TP<br />
<br />
2 hategivers from about 12 kills<br />
2 Bloodfrenzys from around 6 kills<br />
4 BoCs from around 12 kills (dropped 2 once)<br />
1 Xana hammer in 27+ kills (That sucked)<br />
2 BoWs in 3 kills so far (fingers crossed that stays like that hehe)<br />
<br />
So on average for us its about one out of three, except Xana who was a tight git.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Sithanator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">BoC seems like the AoW most common drop, seen 2 drop acouple of times. Only had a few aow which one didn't drop. No warrior in my guild currently need a BoC.<br />
<br />
1 Blood frenzy in 3 cursed<br />
0 hategiver in 3 XTC <br />
Later<br />
Sith</div></div><hr />
