I hunt green goblins, and sometimes venture into the greater faydark to go to crushbone, or hunt elven bandits. My main concern is that im not leveling right, or not in the right areas.<br />
<br />
Which mobs should i be fighting, where should I head to, and which is the best exp?<br />
<br />
Mobs I kill <br />
Green Goblins   Con: Blue <br />
Orc Legionares  Con: Light Blue <br />
Elven Bandits    Con: Blue  To Yellow <br />

Paludal is good until around level 24 or 26 then you got a choice of going to Maru Seru, Neitherbien Lair or for the best experience HighKeep.  After those zones you got a broad choice of zones to go to.  <br />
<br />
<br />
For the bastard sword that is mighty fine for your level.  Just keep plugging away at the levels and have fun.   If you have any other questions please do not hesitate to ask</div></div><hr />

Make it a point to group with someone.  You can start building a network of friends, and it's just more fun.<br />
<br />
If you don't want to group with others, re-roll a druid or necro.  The latter is a blast and can easily solo to 56 or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rysingsun1</div><div class="date">12-07-2003, 04:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">you are nearing the top of the level range where soloing will be a viable option so start thinking group-minded. your job is to be in the monster's face and protect the casters who as you will level up you will notice dont absorb damage well. i think most will agree with me that blue con mobs (especially at the lower end of the range) are going to be more profitable for experience than higher conning mobs which mostly just lead to long down times while your group recouperates. crushbone is a very good zone to fight in at your level because high levels come by from time to time and give you free buffs :) ... but do not dishonor the warrior name by begging for them.</div></div><hr />
