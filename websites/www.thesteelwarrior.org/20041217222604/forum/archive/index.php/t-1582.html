<br />
To the point I  have Ambidexterity, Punishing Blade 3, CF2 and living shield 2.<br />
<br />
Side not: All my defensive aa's are completely maxed (though of course that has nothing to do with agro).<br />
<br />
In most groups im ok but there those groups, (you know the ones That I'm talking about) that make me nuts with ping pong.<br />
<br />
I dont have my epic yet, but I am close, nothing ruins my day more than not being able to taunt the way I want to. The crazy thing is when I have found with PB3 and my windblade I hold the best agro out of any of my weapons you see here! How is this possible?  I know I cant be getting dps agro but it seems that way, none the less i have tested this over the past few months<br />
and hands down the windblade is the most reliable agro I have,<br />
and I KNOW the Windblade is not an agro weapon.<br />
<br />
You would think that with WC in primary and anklesmasher in secondary with Ambidexterity and CF2 that would be reliable agro, its not.  My dex is always maxed:<br />

<br />
PLEASE help ! :mad:</div></div><hr />

In reality, it's actually not a bad aggro weapon, depending of course on who you're grouped with.<br />
<br />
Looking at the weapons you listed above, I'd say that I'm honestly not surprised that the Windblade out-aggros all of them.<br />
<br />
As for an upgrade.. Maybe think about a Greatstaff of Thunder? I had one for a long time and I loved it.</div></div><hr />

I usually request it when I am in one of those kinda groups. Hasn't been so bad lately though, but I havn't been exp'in much.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, I noticed last night in BoT my Stonebladed Axe of Dismay (44/44) held agro superb. I held agro from a rogue, a paladin and whenever the shammy slowed. <br />
<br />
/shrug somedays it's good for me, others I break out the Frosty/General Sword and pray for a proc.</div></div><hr />

Mobs were on me like glue. That was before PoP xp zones and luclin stuff, but snare is always a good aggro proc. Try putting Anklesmasher main and that lurid dagger offhand. IMO, Wavecrasher is overrated.<br />
<br />
also, as said before, windblade is usually dissed alot because it's the &quot;twink&quot; weapon of choice, but to be honest, it's a damn nice 2hs. since you have PB3, i can see you getting more aggro cause of more hits.<br />
<br />
try, my above combo, and if that doesn't help, then just use windblade :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nothing you can do except education which is what the past 10000000 posts have been talking about vs knights immediate agro.  <br />
<br />
Fortunaly or unfortunaly warriors require a little pampering to keep agro lock, couple seconds alone on the mob, root, agro spells... list goes on.... even a CHSD and BOC with no procs the first 5 seconds isnt going to agro lock against an incoming slow/pet/nuke crit....</div></div><hr />

If you are a masher use Disarm all u want ..If u see the mob turn then HIT taunt, I was in your shoes a while back changed up my game play and its helped alot, Also look into gettting a NORGE TAL..drops in SSRA easy to get an a small raid hit..</div></div><hr />

Norge'Tal is a very click weapon for both DPS and taunt though :) A nice no-drop upgrade to the Greatstaff of Thunder.</div></div><hr />

I two/three/four box in groups, often with at least 2 &quot;critical&quot; roles (Tank/Cleric) (Tank/Ench) (Ench/Cler) read: Non Dps slots. In these situations, paticularly when the warrior is involved, i NEED him to be able to hold aggro while i do what must be done on the othercharacters within the group, i've found all it takes is 1 proc from the sword, and its over... that thing turns its head and keeps it that way, id have to stop attacking for 10 seconds for it to *Think* about going after someone else. Even when it doesnt proc, the DPS is excellent, and great for holding aggro all its own.. on my server, this sword goes for about 350-400k, i assume its less on other servers, because my server started killing AoW LAAAAAATEEE comparitive to other servers. If you can save for 6 months,  maybe trim your gear down a bit if neccesary, sell off current weapons, this thing is the do all and end all of aggro weapons, period. I will NEVER upgrade this sucker. Not only does it make my job 500% easier, i feel goddamn proud when I get commended on how well I can hold aggro, and people tell me maybe warriors arent so bad afterall. Just my 2c</div></div><hr />

I find that if I plug an arrow or two into a mob as it comes in to camp and then time my taunts for right after the malo/tash and the yawns/slows messages I rarely have problems.<br />
<br />
If the slower is slowing as the mob comes in, just nicely explain that you need for them to wait a little bit on the slows.  If they don't get the message eventually a mob will beat that idea into them.</div></div><hr />

I feel like I keep repeating myself, but a while ago, (1-2 years? just after CT was revamped.. went in the same time that the &quot;slows can be removed by a cure disease&quot; fix went in.) slow agro was changed considerably because Shaman/enchanters were getting pasted by the high level mobs in CT.<br />
<br />
As a side effect, the agro on a slow proc weapon was reduced significantly.  Willsapper, wavecrasher, ToD, etc..  <br />
<br />
<br />
No it wasn't.<br />
<br />
Well, sort of with the ToD, but here's what happened.  Disease counters were added to shaman and enchanter spells so they could be cured.  This made aggro on them insane.  For some reason disease spells had higher aggro than other spells.  Consequently, they lowered the aggro on disease spells so slow aggro would be similar to what it was before the change (side effect was also nerfing the aggro on the low-level SK dot).  <br />
<br />
This ONLY happened on shaman/enchanter spells.  Breath of the Sea (wavecrasher proc) and Energy Sap (willsapper proc) are not shaman/enchanter spells.  They never had any disease counters added to them.  They are not cureable (good to know in PvP).  They never had their aggro increased or reduced in any way.  <br />
<br />
Other slow spells (like the ToD proc which is an enchanter spell) still have plenty of aggro.  I'm sure that any warrior that groups in PoP knows that.  They just don't have the insane aggro that they had for a few days after the disease counters were added.  Slow procs are still great aggro, and also very useful when grouping without a slower.  Willsapper and wavecrasher are both great aggro weapons, the same as they have always been.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">warcry</div><div class="date">07-25-2003, 04:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, back fro the battlefield and here is what i found.<br />
<br />
Ditched the crasher, just cant rely on it anymore im tired of waiting on its procs.<br />
<br />
BOC was just out of the question and SOD was as well, though id love to pick up either, cash does not permit.<br />
<br />
Picked up 3 things, great staff of thunder, hammer of striking,<br />
fosty.<br />
<br />
To recap i have ambidex and punishing blade 3.<br />
<br />
Now I recently trained flurry 1 and 2,  working on 3.<br />
<br />
Even with my old weapons I noticed a taunt upgrade even when my flurry did not  &quot;proc&quot; for lack of a better word, not  huge increase in agro but a noticeable one from the start of battle.<br />
<br />
Current agro setup:<br />
<br />
When I use duel wield, I have the hammer in my primary<br />
and anklesmasher / or frosty in my 2nd.<br />
<br />
2hnd = great staff of thunder over my windblade,<br />
<br />
Here is the funny thing, with either combo I hold great ago in<br />
all zones besides BOT, I freaking hate that zone for agro, its still a nightmare, maybe its the people in that zone, agro management is a lost art anymore.<br />
<br />
With either setup if I am having 2hb agro problems I swap to DW, DW agro issues then I swap 2hb, 95 pct of the time i have no one in group dropping below 100 % health but me, again BOT is a totally dif story, I feel like  newb in the zone.<br />
Anyone have this experience? I find my self turning down BOT groups because of the agro nightmare, and i am always replacing a pally or sk, which is always fun, not.<br />
<br />
Also one thing I learned I was faulting myself, I was always pushing for extra attack, so any time I had an enchanter in group I would beg for nights dark terror for the attack, dex and lifetaps<br />
to help with agro.<br />
<br />
Guess what, for a test I took off NDT and used slam (which was always my pref) since I was not in illusion, yes I had less dex which should equal less procs, but I had on avg almost the same amount of procs per battle (unbuffed dex around 205), and the stun in slam is still great agro.  I have been shorting myself with ullusions for way to long!<br />
<br />
I held better agro in my natural form with slam than I did with a taunting type of illusion (forced to use kick), go figure.<br />
<br />
Another thing stuns on pull, gah!  I'm a Barb so  I did some tests and found if I have my bow still out from tagging when the mob engages me I'm VERY likely to be stunned, if I tag then hit attack so my weapons are out I rarely get stunned, and as we all know being stunned in the begging of the battle is not good, thats our crucial time to build up agro for debuffs and slows, so that helped ALOT for my agro as well, didnt cost me a dime!<br />
Question some mobs stun with spells, so I know that cant be avoided much but, has anyone spent some aa in Stalwart Endurance ? Looks usefull to be when im up to date on my offensive.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I'm on a never ending quest, maybe one day I'll get a BOC, SOD, but for now I'll have to settle for what I have.<br />
Working on maxing offensive aa's atm, trying to choose wisely.<br />
<br />
NOTE: I am 1 battle away from completing my epic (POS run) so<br />
wish me luck, i like to mix things up with new combos once i have my red blade).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trondir</div><div class="date">07-25-2003, 05:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">From my experience I can tell that once the ping pong has started its pretty much impossible to get agro back as a warrior with dps or with small procs. That being said, a BIG hate proc is pretty much the only thing that can get you agro back when multiple casters started pingponging, and with agro back I mean they can sit down again at a reasonable distance to the mob without immediately being attacked again. <br />
Getting agro when standing is one thing, but that just means extra downtime for the group.<br />
I suggest you getting one of the new Stun DD proccers from Droga for example<br />
<br />
a lucky 4k crit no weapon on Norath i <br />
<br />
Crits dont add agro on spells.<br />
<br />
<br />
oh and I dont believe that a windblade holds agro well really. Its good DPS, but thats all. Especially since its good DPS for a warrior. Usually there are 2-3 players in your group that do more DPS than your windblade and therefor already cause a small threat to your agro management. <br />
 A wizard probably would cry if he had the DPS of a windblade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vigdis SangCaru</div><div class="date">07-25-2003, 05:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with Hyard.  Plug an arrow into the mob upon incoming, which immediately bumps you up the list, and time your first taunt to land after tash and/or slow, which ought to grant you agro list +1.  Yeah, I know taunt doesn't always work and I also know there is a disagreement between the gnashers and the timers, but more often than not this strategy keeps agro for me. <br />
<br />
Worse case scenario, ask your groupmates to calm down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">07-25-2003, 05:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">dunno but warrior with Windblade was able to pull agro off me while I was using BBB we roughly had same AAs and I almost never have agro probs unless taunt not working 5+ times in row. Happen more then once while we were xping.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">07-25-2003, 06:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You did the right thing picking up the copper hammer of striking, now get a sword of the bloodsworn and you'll never worry about aggro again.  That combo is absolutely insane for aggro for the dfficulty of the encounter.  <br />
<br />
Once those things start proccing, people have to be downright complete dumbass to take aggro off you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">warcry</div><div class="date">07-28-2003, 11:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, read up alot on that sword, more I read the more I liked it.<br />
<br />
sword of the bloodsworn is now im my 2nd<br />
and copper hammer of striking in my primary because i have found agro is better that way.  I have to say taunt is like nothing I have weilded yet to date.  I feel like a king, er that is until every fucking rogue and monkey and shaman and and,, get a hold of these weapons... you get the point =).<br />
<br />
No I am not a god, but for basicly 50k to get that much of a<br />
taunt upgrade, i never thought it would be possible.<br />
<br />
I just wish these weapons came out a year ago <br />
<br />
Also I just practiced Stalwart Endurance 2, get it it rocks plain and simple, no more being stunned loosing valuable agro time before the slow/ tash goes off, my ass is locked on that mob form the start, till the very end.  I cant wait till I get Stalwart Endurance 3. <br />
<br />
<br />
Oh last though i forgot to edit in, kind of comical, every group I got in they said &quot;wow nice taunt, link your weapon please so I can go buy one and out taunt you and put you back in your place on the taunt scale, silly warriors wanting taunt geez... wait thats an all all weapon ? sweet ill get one for my mage and really make the next warrior insane, life is good!&quot;<br />
<br />
Note to self: you have the right to reject linking your equipment in group! say somrthing like &quot;cant I just be mysterious and origional for 5 mins?&quot;<br />
<br />
OK um, it didnt really happen like that but something like that was going on in their heads, I know it =)  bastards!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">07-28-2003, 01:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Haha congrats, agro is very frustrating most times, and that is what makes all of us so happy when we finally get some great agro weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crayno</div><div class="date">07-29-2003, 08:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ping pong is usally a result of uneducated players.<br />
The only one that is allowed to pull aggro is the slower,no one else.<br />
If that's set,position yourself next to the slower on inc and wait until you see the slow message,hit taunt immediately and you should be set.<br />
In case of resisting slows or failing taunts there's always /shield and ae taunt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">friss</div><div class="date">07-30-2003, 10:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pop mobs hit to hard, so a lot of enchanters these days use ping pong and pathing to help them stay out of melee range while they are slowing.  So if slow is being resisted, expect to chase the mob around, as the enchanters starts to play with it.  <br />
<br />
Another problem is the amount of hate DD's and even worse DOT's  generate.  In no way should dots generate more agro then slow,  but they do these days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dakryn</div><div class="date">07-30-2003, 06:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Warcry is right<br />
At 65 I had absolutely terrible aggro,was using a Snowchipper and a Def.Lightblade still mainly because all the good upgrades cost out of my price range.<br />
Then, I found the Sword of the Bloodsworn and Fleshgrinder have both dropped to about 20k on my server (Karana).I traded/sold some stuff and now have awesome aggro with Sword in Main and FG offhand.<br />
MT for my guild has a BoC and uses the Sword in Offhand.<br />
Definitely great aggro weapon.<br />
<br />
It drops in the new droga/nurga cant remember which.Very good weapon drops off relativily easy mob for the stats of the weapon</div></div><hr />

But even then, you can always root it after it's snared too.</div></div><hr />

Root never last long, plus most melee hate it, and rangers scream when you use it.</div></div><hr />
