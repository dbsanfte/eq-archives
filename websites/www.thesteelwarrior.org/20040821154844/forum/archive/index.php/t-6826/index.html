<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>cantar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">what ever happen to the idea of giveing warriors more who use Shields it was posted under develment but nothing ever came to about it. 1 thing thay could do would be to Up our damge output from our main hand. <br />
<br />
Ideas,Flames and suggetion open</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>cantar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">err also ment to add more decent shields need to drop befor any of this could posably happen</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Korinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">add a shield that wont mean i lose taunt from offhand procs and wont lose too much dps then i might consider using a shield, but atm there are no shields like that so its a non issue.<br />
<br />
Sony has alot of things &quot;under development&quot; only a small percentage of those ideas they announce publicly ever go live. Then again somy like to throw out new, unfinished things into the game so we might get a buggy shield with massive taunt before we get a zone anywhere in eq thats finished and free from bugs /rude pc/npc faling into the ground and 1000 other things</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Paen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You cant balance dual wield and two handers with a dodge/block etc.. mod on shields, every warrior would absolutely have to use a shield on bosses because thats what they would be tuned to, it would be very hard to balance if at all possible to say the least. I dont mind equipping a shield when disc fades to add to survivability but if I had to use one all the time I would be pretty pissed, I'm glad they scrapped the idea personally. <br />
<br />
If anything they should just let warriors and knights use bucklers as one bracer (as theyre intended) if they add any form of meaningful dodge or block mods to them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">the problem is how damage is figured on the shiled. a 100ac shield would hit around 590 max. no matter how you figure it thats close to to much on a &lt;10 second delay for a bash heh 59 dps just from a string of max bashes. realisticly 20 or so dps, less with misses. humm thats prolly about right. but then your way to close to raex bp ac, <br />
<br />
 just nake furious bash work or add type 4 to shields. heh go go anger 3 shield.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">One of the big problems with shields is that Knights already have a fair number of decent 1handers in the game designed to be used with a shield.  While Warriors really don't have many, if any.  All of our 1handers have been designed with the idea of our duel wielding.  Our aggro generation is designed with the idea of duel wielding, although this is less true these days with incite, it's still true..  Using a 1hander and shield a Warrior would lose significantly more than a Knight and it would be difficult to make up for that for the Warrior without boosting the Knight more at the same time.  Shields are very problematic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You'd have to design shields that could only be used by warriors, which have a higher block rate or better special ability than what's available for non dual wielding classes.... that's really the only way they could have done it. Then have a different series of shield which much lower effects, to offset the better onehanders that hybrids have, as well as maintain the difference in tanking abilities between warriors and hybrid plate classes. Or, alternatively, change the coding so that the same shield gave a better bonus to a warrior, or a single 1-hander would have better damage if it was the only weapon that a warrior wielded.<br />
<br />
It's doable, but only if they designed shields and weapons so that they were seperate like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>cantar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">what i thought would be design weapons that are just as good as some of the knight blades but make it only equipable if shield is equiped first. theres a few outher options to look at when considering doing it this way like should the new or improved weapons be warrior only type of weapons and if so how many and witch zones do thay need to add them. or you could just increse the damge of main hander when useing a sheild but then ya incress the knights ablity too. inless you make it a warrior only type of Skill that we have to train in (kinda like that idea givein warriors a new skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Want to fix shields for ever ?<br />
<br />
Remove FuriousCRAP.<br />
<br />
For Every FuriousCRAP 1 , put Combat Effects 3.<br />
<br />
We loose a LOT of DPS &amp; some Agro to gain survivability.<br />
Knights get a DPS boost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Seems pretty easy to make a shield warriors would use.  Just put combat effects and/or innate +hate effects (like the raex bp) on them.  Forget about dps, it doesn't matter in a situation where you would use a shield (main tanking).  Make them warrior only.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I vote for a shield with right click instant cast invis to animals</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Given the root/snare gap that has unjustly affected Warriors, Tanglewood Shield should have Warriors added to the usable class list. Look at our archery skill cap - aren't we 90% Rangers?<br />
<br />
Bloodied Ancile's Pouch, Fleeting Quiver, Stonewood Compound Bow, and Hawkeye Potions are a reasonable start. C'mon SoE, fair is fair - Tanglewood Shield.<br />
<br />
BB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">heh unlimited charges insta click holy might shield.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Hinanek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">They should just let wars equip all shields in the back slot</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Azaza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Call me crazy (or worse, cause I know someone will after they read this)....<br />
<br />
I'd like to see 2H shields.<br />
<br />
Now you're saying 'WTF???'<br />
<br />
Possible thoughts on use (given the chance) :<br />
<br />
-Bigger bash dmg with HIGH pct chance to stun,<br />
<br />
-Group /SHIELD ability,<br />
<br />
-AE 'avoidance'  (i am picturing image of warrior hiding behind shield avoiding the dragon breath)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Annoc Starshield</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">This got me to thinking about a friend of mine that plays DAoC.  There is a skill that allows shields to be VERY effective by blocking incoming attacks.  Even though it would require alot of work what would you think of this as a base idea?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Mourningloree</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Something I was toying around with that might be useful and help out the knights as well is to make shield AC / SOMENUMBER (From 5 to 15 someplace in there) act as DI shielding.  IE: If SOMENUMBER is 10, then the ac80 shields would reduce DI by 8%, or for the ikkinz crowd drop the max hit by 160...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>AThousandYoung</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Shields should be very strong, but there should be diminishing returns for AC.  In real combat, shield + 1h weapon beats dual wielding or two handed weapons.  Dual wield is used either 1) when carrying a shield is impractical (rapier and dagger), or 2) when your armor is so good that the shield is just overkill (this would be the EQ Warrior's situation).<br />
<br />
2h Shield is a silly idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Azaza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">... 2h Shield is a silly idea.<br />
<br />
Then if it ever comes out, don't use one. I can only see it as expanding warrior utility.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Balkins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">id use a shield if it magicly appered in my bags and had a +1000 to hotness</div></div><hr />
