The real equation is (Time X Difficulty)=work<br />
<br />
That means that someone who plays 7 hours a day but only does LDoN/BoT/Tactics that they can't possibly fail at anymore unless server goes down or lots go LD, is not equal to the work of a person who has spent that same time raiding up to GoD content and finishing PoP content simply due ot the difficulty of doing so. <br />
<br />
You can not tell me that doing LDoN or xp in BoT is as tuff as dying over and over again trying to learn and win fights like RZ, Zegony, Coirnav, Rathe, all Time content, Ikk 4, Uqua etc.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Apolyon, you have 2 problems.<br />
<br />
The first is that you think you know what I, and others want out of this game.  Of course, due to your second problem (That you're a fucking idiot), you're wrong.  Now there's nothing wrong with being an idiot, hell, most of the world's population is made of idiots, but it'd be nice if you were aware of it, that's why I'm telling you.  This way you can preface your posts with &quot;This may just be the opinion of an idiot&quot; or somesuch, so that when you're done, we can just say &quot;Yes, you're a dipshit, now pay attention and you might learn something,&quot; and save us all some time.<br />
<br />
Seriously...I make a post saying what I want out of the game and you try to tell me that I don't.  You're looking pretty fucking retarded here, maybe it's time to try a different approach.  Maybe one that involves other people having a different viewpoint on the game than you do, and hell...even PLAYING A DIFFERENT GAME THAN YOU DO BECAUSE OF THE RAID CONTENT YOU ENJOY YOU IGNORANT FUCKTARD.<br />
<br />
I hope I've been clear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You can not tell me that doing LDoN or xp in BoT is as tuff as dying over and over again trying to learn and win fights like RZ, Zegony, Coirnav, Rathe, all Time content, Ikk 4, Uqua etc.<br />
<br />
You're massively rewarded for all that, when all is said and done.  Unless you'd like to argue that having gear that gives you double the HP, AC, probably resists, and additional effects beyond that of a more typical player, isn't enough of a reward?<br />
<br />
The question isn't whether or not raiders earn their progress.  The question is are non-raiders and more lower end/casual raiders being allowed sufficient progress.  If you argue they are, but that they should be required to do things like spend six months solid in LDoN to gear up for new content and new expansions, what happens when they reach a point where the limited progression paths are no longer entertaining?  This is supposed to be about fun, right?  Or is it all about being able to show up the other guy and laugh at him when he can't do content you consider trivial because of the gear you've acquired with your raiding guild?<br />
<br />
Each player pays $13 a month regardless of whether they're in PoTime, GoD, or still grinding away in LDoN.  If they become disillusioned with the content and decide it's no longer any fun, they'll leave.  It doesn't really matter where they are within the scope of the game.  Boredom + tedium + disenchantment = no longer paying subscription fees.  SOE needs to think about whether or not the way they're doing things is going to keep enough people paying their subscription fees in the long run.  If they think it will, then the status quo is fine and those of us not happy with it will leave, sooner or later.  If they think it won't, then changes are in order, regardless of how pissy raiders may get about it.<br />
<br />
It is a business after all.  And making money is their job.</div></div><hr />

<br />
3 cheers for being an idiot?  Then again ... looking on the bright side it might be you who i fuck up with on the operating table.  Those damn idiots ...<br />
<br />
You wanted something out of an online gaming experience than EQ had to offer you, so you quit and moved on.  Why are you still here?<br />
<br />
In the meantime i'm not even talking to you here Haass, so take the bullshit elsewhere.  Your attitude and approach to the situation is entirely different than Gerick's.  I can respect that you want more challenging content for your private circle of friends without having to raid with 71 other individuals.  It really is a shame that you left before LDoN and GoD came out, as that is exactly what it is geared towards (at least to a certain degree).  Looks like you simply threw in the towel too soon.<br />
<br />
Ps-  youre still bitter about the Droga/GSoT 1hander/2hander debate?  Grow up ... neither the world nor this thread revolves around you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yes, just what the world needs.  Another arrogant doctor who thinks that just because he's gone to medical school, or in this case plans on going to medical school, that makes him a superior human being.<br />
<br />
Good luck in medical school Apoloyn.  Do try not to kill too many patients if by some chance you manage to not flunk out.  If there is anything worse than an idiot, it's an arrogant idiot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yeah,how you spend your time is up to you.Joining a guild pre velious content and clawing your way to time with them is a lot more challenging and difficult than roaming ldon hallways endlessly or any other one group content.By investing the time,effort and practice to beat certain content you get rewards.Like all of eq you are expected to &quot;earn&quot; your rewards not just be granted them.&quot;Merit&quot; as BB suggests has value in a game like this that is so time intensive.Every one coming up faces differant challenges and no one really gets a free ride.Sure people can cheat with yantis and leap into the arms of a time guild straight out of luclin.It's not perfect,but, unless you envy those cheaters and folks who skip a lot of the game to be with friends or whatever it's not worth worrying about.<br />
<br />
I see problems with opening up even sol ro upon reflection.Yeah ,you and your level 70 buds will farm nice stuff off the mini's there,but, you'll also create the same &quot;cockblocks&quot; you've mentioned for guilds trying to work through that content.What happens in fire with 10 groups of level 70 non raiders when a guild zones in to clear the named.I can see the&quot;I was here first to xp&quot; and &quot;that guild trained me when they cleared through&quot; stuff being constant.Raiders having earned their spots in fire and being subject to their guilds normally always yield to guilds raiding.It's accepted normal behaviour.<br />
<br />
The content that needs to be added for non raiders is new stuff.I think the pop ladder  is best left as is now.New god drops are much richer for groups than ep groupable stuff with more to come I'm sure. I'd like to see more quality content for guilds and groups from LDON ish level and up.More stuff to fill the gap for people who just don't want to raid.Of course item quality should be reflected by the power of the mobor quest.No one should get ep mold equivilant drops from group play unless they can kill mobs the strength of those that drop them now.God is better xp and better loot imo than ep's in any case and you won't be run over constantly by guilds doing raid targets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Apo, he is right you are telling people what they should want and what they should think rather than arguing over the real topics<br />

1) bottom feeding, at what point is it not fair and how should it be stopped<br />
<br />
2) the erosion of the path to progress to sol ro and beyond(for those that want to go beyond, i dont)<br />
<br />
3) is the LDoN reward for easys unfair? seems easy is for normal people and hard is for raiders, double the points just like they have double our stats. Should their be a medium that doesnt require the gear you have to buy in order to be a success? (this is ment as in, i would need all the LDoN hard gear bought before i could do hards, this is redundant)<br />
<br />
4) mobs not being up because they are killed for loot that is upgrades, and spawnable flag only monsters<br />
<br />
5) time should count in risk and reward, we loose time we cant have back in life to do these over and over again<br />
<br />
6) can anything be done to make LDoN more fun?<br />
<br />
just telling me how to progress is alot like me telling you how to lead a guild even tho you are not the guild leader, it is pointless.<br />
<br />
Haass has every right to post as a old board vet and an EQ vet, he continues to post and care because he loves EQ like we all do, but can not stand it in its current state, I beleave he even renews his acount several times a year to keep his toon from being delete but also to keep himself from using an acount he doesnt have fun on.</div></div><hr />

I fail to see where this statement makes you not an idiot.  I do however see how this statement makes you either 1) an arrogant prick that thinks that someone starting medical school, not finishing, makes you anything.  or 2) a fuckin liar.<br />
<br />
I'll impart a little information to you.  It doesn't take intelligence, personality, drive or ability to attended college.  Some of the most uneducated people on the planet have made some of the largest impacts, Ramanujan for starters.  My point is this, and here is another lesson for you probably the most important one you will ever learn, you mean dick.  You can live or die and the impact it would have will be unnoticeable.  You have your opinion and in this country you are welcome to express it all you want, but don't for a second think that anything you have done or plan on doing in your life at this point makes you better or your opinion more valid in any way.  You have the mentality of immature teenager, if it is true you are about to start college then you are about to be slapped down real hard.  <br />

You know what bourbon ... you are absolutely right. (by the way, medical school is not college ... just something to chew on). On the same note calling me a Fucking Idiot for having a differing opinion is equally as much bullshit.   I know good and well what Haass wanted out of EQ .. shame they added it after he left. The funny thing is ... i wasnt even addressing him or his ideas.  I was conversing with Gerick.  As to me telling people what they want ... i've done no such thing.

<br />
And this is the crux of the issue .. there really is no way you can &quot;fix&quot; this.  If there is no definitive reward given to those who pour tons of time into this game and raid, then they will leave the game having no reason to work at it.  If you close off everything  requiring everyone to unlock all content via raiding (which some have neither the time nor the will to do), then all casual players will have a mass exodus.<br />
<br />
So far Sony has done a decent job balancing this casual/raider content, but in this thread it is clear that several casuals have a hard-on for the perks of serious, avid raiders and players.  Personally, i find it funny that those who claim to have hit this &quot;glass ceiling&quot; really havent even invested the time to get anywhere close and are more content to simply complain about it (which is wrong).  Or perhaps people such as Haass who quit the game before sony added content to help balance the casual/raider issues.  What you, Mr Haass, fail to realize is that LDoN and GoD (both released after you thew in the towel) provided individuals with paths to alternate progression.  GoD trials capitalize on this, but you need to spend a bit of time gearing up for them.  Still, though, you come here spouting off bullshit nonesense about an issue which has already been balanced and fixed.  I'm sorry you quit before it was employed, but never having seen it you dont really have any authority to preach that casual/raider content is still unbalanced.<br />
<br />
You cannot expect to receive all the perks of hardcore raiders and avid eq players without investing the same amount of time into progressing.  LDoN and GoD saw different, alternate paths to progression and new content ... especially GoD with the trials opening up time level zones and time instanced dungeons with time quality loot.  I'm sure sony will continue to adress this issue in OoW.<br />
<br />
In the meantime, if you are not doing all that you can to better yourself, then dont complain that the most hardcore raiders serverwide have twice your hitpoints.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">1) bottom feeding, at what point is it not fair and how should it be stopped<br />
<br />
How loaded and presumtive can a single sentence get??@!!!!!!!<br />
<br />
How's this instead?:<br />
<br />
1) bottom equipped (the practice of a level 65 wearing equipment a level 50 would be ashamed of) at what point is it merely laughable and at what point should the offender be no longer allowed to log in since they've already &quot;lost&quot;.<br />
<br />
There is no such thing as &quot;bottom feeding&quot;. It's a made up term assclowns like you use to to label others killing solo or with a group a mob that you need a mini-&quot;raid&quot; to handle.<br />
<br />
&quot;at what point is it not fair&quot;. Not fair? Lemme see.... when you can NOT get experiance, sell the loot, make a tradeskill item with a looted component, progress in a quest with a looted item, use it for a twink, or need the faction - killing for ANY of the reasons listed are legitimate.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Oh ya, nearly forgot. The mob flashed a rival gang sign or gave ya's a &quot;look&quot;. I often go to the Tower in Crushbone because I like the view. D'vinn pertends he doesn't notice me, but then he gives me a smart-assed look. Die D'Vinn. King Tormax has been known to do this too.<br />
<br />
Unless of course some holster that's level 65 and equipped worse than your level 52 twink calls you a &quot;bottom feeder&quot; - in which case you should kill the mob, announce the loot in /tells and then destroy the crap while vowing to camp and farm the mob henceforth till the last server is turned off.<br />
<br />
&quot;how should it be stopped&quot; Also very presumtive. BUT I have a suggestion. Cut the stats of all items older than one expansion in half. If in two freaking years someone can't at level 65 get a ToSoRo key, they don't need decent gear anyway, it would be a complete waste.<br />
<br />
Alternately, quadruple the stats of all equipment that can be found in locked content in the EP's and beyond. &quot;High-level&quot; players are unlikely to bother with the crap players like Gerick are concerned might be &quot;bottom fed&quot; except to ask 100K PP for it and laugh like heck when they will pay that rather than get a stoopid key that your girlfriend's cat's fifth worst twink got a year ago.<br />

<br />
I thought i would offer up a magelo I made to see just where LDoN will get you. I'm thinking that I did something wrong, because I'm not seeing the progression, even though I had previously about settle on LDoN being a good progression for casual/non-raiders. It's late, I'm sure I missed some stuff in it, you'll just have to trust me when I say I tried to find the best setup to work with fro an example. I'm not trying to prove a point anymore, I was just personally curious and decided to take alook at what I could do. I was a little underwhelmed by the results.<br />
<br />
Here's the magelo: http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1074730<br />
<br />
I followed a simple rule while making it. I used nothing but LDoN purchased gear, in most cases the difference detween LDoN single group drops and bought were not much. Ofcourse that makes it a less than accurate decription of what a player might be equiped like after completely farming LDoN. However it is fairly consistant and from there we can speculate a little more reliably.<br />
<br />
Its late and I need some shut eye, so I'll have to pick this up tomorrow. I will say that, as it is, I don't see the progression for casuals from LDoN merchants. Even after all this farming, some players would be reluctant to have this player as MT on hard setting.<br />
<br />
Then again, maybe I've been up too long and just need a fresh pair of eyes...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Well, to be honest, a lot of stuff is just better that can be more easily gotten one group. Then also, the rings aren't all that + bag of chips, and of course the armor is unauged, even with stat augs which will help.<br />
<br />
 Only problem I can see with all that is that it's a conservative 20k points to get, 51 at a time. So about 400 LDoN wins, and if averages hold steady, about 500 attempts, give or take 20 or so.<br />
<br />
 What would be REALLY nice is to get back the old XP rates - as it is now, you have a choice of grinding LDoN for points or going virtually anywhere else for AA's. Can't see the harm in revamping it, as the XP rates are already available in other zones.</div></div><hr />

constructive twinking is different then bottom feeding. bottom feeding is killing it just to kill it. like killing vindi just to kill it.<br />
<br />
remember when it was crafted vs. fear/hate but you could go to fear/hate and get the gear.<br />

<br />
rember when it was mal/ra/ornate vs Vadds/ all/all gates stuff augged with free augs.<br />
<br />
notice a patteren. i went from no different gear to gear older then dirt in eq time.<br />
<br />
that is why us old timers are pissed.<br />
<br />
<br />
for some reason people got the idea that watching tv for four hours pressing the assist key and auttoattack was different between casuals and raiders.<br />
<br />
wtf tactics yea it takes like 4 people max the people who realy drive the guild to figure it out or get the leet info from another server. been their done that don't deny it. and the other mindles half afk tv watching drons to catch a smidgeon of the info to zerg suggesfully and beat the mob/mobs.<br />
<br />
the real difference is you have 6+ zerglets and i stay less then equal to 6 zerglets. the time isn't different the time isn't worth less the time to get gear isn't longer or shorter for either. infact along time ago nothing seperated me from the raider. full russet vs full russet. pickup vox naggy raids got me vox naggy loots. had a yak and ebw and exe axe. <br />
<br />
no matter what till people broke into eq i stayed close to the top 80% atleast most of the time. then bam i'm suddenly 50% because i chose not to raid and get flaggs.<br />
<br />
i can't tank for friends ive had over 5 years because they raid well i can but nothing worthwhile for them. <br />
<br />
hell yea i'm cryin i would be a fool not to. i saw the who dang decline of the casual.<br />
<br />
you can claim that places were made for casuals but we know your folling yourself. loy was great till you discovered you need a dang raid to get the loot thats better then the crap your allready wearing. ldon yeah i'm sure all the peeps in mostly all ornate are jummping for joy at all the new exzactly the same without nifty effects armor. wo wo. gates i will say is fun all of the 3 times i have managed to get a group their since it freeking went live.<br />

we dont want free shit never have never will. i just dont want to have to get it with 72 dips.</div></div><hr />

44 day of play time is a reasonable grind length to get gear that is considered baseline to do the content deemed &quot;appropriate&quot; for our level of play?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">After listening to all this stuff making everything no drop is sounding better.I always hated the bazaar anyways.<br />
<br />
its moved from a long way in that direction over the last 5 years. on the other hand a lot of people LIKE the bazaar so making it all no drop to make it better for some also makes it worse for others.<br />
<br />
there are advantages and disadvantages to both philophoshies of loot type. just to name a few ...<br />
<br />
advantages of everything being no drop:<br />
<br />
1) harder to twink alts.<br />
2) reduces bottom feeding. (still done for tradeskill items though)<br />
3) reduces looting procedure arguments.<br />
4) encourages people to do more variety of zones --&gt; less boredom.<br />
<br />
disadvantages:<br />
<br />
1) those who consider trading to be an enjoyable part of the game lose out.<br />
2) people bringing alts into high level zones to vulture the rotting loot.<br />
3) tradeskills lose most of their appeal. after all why earn cash through tradeskills if there is nothing to spend it on?<br />
<br />
regarding number 2) of disadvantages sony has tried to eliminate this with level requirements but that has its own disadvantages. i know of a number of items that are considered junk by anyone who has reached the level where he can use something. it wasnt that way when it first started dropping but has become that way in time.<br />
<br />
i still think the best solution most of the twinking and bottom feeding problems is &quot;you can only loot a mob that you got exp for ...period.&quot; this would be good whether dropped items were tradeable or no-drop. it would make bottom feeding impossible and it would also make vulturing impossible. it would of course also break an enormous number of quests, such as i suspect all the epics :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">i still think the best solution most of the twinking and bottom feeding problems is <br />
<br />
I think you're defining bottom feeding too broadly.  Droppable loot isn't a problem.  Killing things vastly below your power curve isn't a problem either.  What becomes a problem is when people who vastly out power boss mobs come back to do them for thrills/loot/boredom.  If boss mobs spawned every couple of hours, I don't think most people would care if they got ganked by a single group of PoTime ubers once in a while.  But they don't, they're a once a week spawn, which means every time a uber squad ganks a boss mob, that's a raid target denied to a lower tier guild.  And most lower tier guilds are the kind that have a set schedule to raid, like Fridays and Weekends for example.  But if all the accessible lower tier raid content has been ganked by ubers come Thursday, well those guilds are SoL.<br />
<br />
It's one thing to lose raid content to peers who are struggling to advance the same as your guild.  It's another to lose it to people for whom it is utterly trivial and who won't use the gear except as twink stuff for the most part.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">yesterday i got a tell from a friend who said &quot;give a tell to so-and-so right now if you want a free flag to tactics.&quot; so i gave this stranger a tell and he invited me to meet him in plane of storms. three of my group joined him and two of his friends in storms and he handed in some items he looted from a (poi i think) raid mob and the group of 6 got a flag to get into tactics.<br />
<br />
well that was easy. i must admit i also got considerably lucky on this one.<br />
<br />
but ... the three of us also abandoned our group without warning leaving the other 3 in the group frustrated by our rudeness of leaving them. it left a good friend of mine angry at me since he turned down 2 invites to group with me then i left him and then he couldnt get a group. lol ) he also was angry because he had been trying for months without success to get that flag. he didnt get it with us because lack of communication led to him not realizing that was where we were going till it was too late and he wasnt part of it :(<br />
<br />
and this is just one more example of why i think the whole flagging thing leads to frustration. i felt like and acted like a real jerk doing that although who would blame me for an opportunity to get a tactics flag in 30 minutes? the only reason i can even think of to keep flagging in existance is because those who have spent many months of hard-core play getting flagged would be seriously cheated if flagging requirements were suddenly lifted without BIG TIME compensation which would put them even further ahead of the pack statwise than they already are. nevertheless it shouldnt have been put there to begin with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">I wanted to make a couple of clarifications since there was speculation.<br />
<br />
If one goes by server firsts, I'm in the #2 guild on my server. The #1 guild is Dark Horizon. Although there was at one time plenty of racing, &quot;cockblocking&quot;, leapfrogging, and general futzing around, it was in the very very distant past on my server. Both DH and my guild have a longstanding reputation for fair play.<br />
<br />
However, every guld I know of raced to kill AoW, KT, the dragons for ST keys, to clear ST, Lodi, the dragon that drops the Green Scale, Ragefire, the Royals, Dain, Ssra named, Seru, etc. etc. etc.<br />
<br />
I'd like to point out that KT is not level 65. Kael in general is waaay pre-60. I believe I first did it at around level 50 and first attempted KT by level 55. So, the complaintent was bottom feeding. Should he not be chidded if he needs the drops to wear (giggle)? He doesn't - Class Diety armor alone is generally superior, besides he's farming Ornate molds in BoT.<br />
<br />
And there's the thing I find objectionable. Like those Paladins that outright asked Defensive to be turned off whenever it's not used to MT an &quot;appropriate&quot; raid mob - some of the posters here have asked for a nerf. Prevent &quot;high-level&quot; players from bottom feeding. Of course when those level 65's bottom feed low level zones, that's entirely different. If we aren't going to get Defensive, the Warrior class defining ability, then nerf Warriors. If we can't enter zones that you can enter because of the MERIT system EQ has had in place for a number of years, why then you should be locked out of zones too. Lock those ubers out of zones, nerf those dastardly Warriors.<br />
<br />
I'd like to see SoE provide a non-progression flag quest for Tower of South Ro. I think it would help non-hard core players a lot. However, there are a few posters in this thread that I'd like to see encounter Quarm each and every time they zoned in. It wouldn't be faaaaaaiiiiir it they missed out on seeing the endgame mob in PoP.<br />
<br />
BB<br />
<br />
 I'm going to point out a couple of things.<br />
<br />
 One is, of course, that when you and the #1 guild on the server were racing content in Velious, Kunark, and Luclin, you didn't have a EP guild already there farming that stuff. Your road was much easier in that respect. It was harder in that you didn't have the gear we have nowadays, true. But at the same time, the gear increases available to the casual are far outstripped by the ability of the Time+/GoD people to absorb old content. I can race a similarly equipped guild, and don't feel bad when I lose. I don't feel good when I have to race a duoboxing Time+ Shaman with a Warrior bot, though, because unless he falls asleep at the keyboard, he wins every time. Same with the two group EP guilders who race a 'casual' guild of 4+ groups to AoW.<br />
<br />
 I don't mind competition. I mind 'competition' where one guy starts the race half done while being faster to boot and he's either going to sell the medal he wins or give it to someone who isn't even in the race, but is related to him. That's not competition by any stretch of the imagination.<br />
<br />
 Secondly, the whole idea behind the word progression involves the idea of moving beyond what you've done before. In the case of say a Velious mob, that's content that's now...five expansions ago for the cutting edge raider. Or is it six? Playing in the sandbox is a great thing when you're in first grade, but a 10th grader who takes the sandbox and chases away the first graders just because he doesn't want to play flag football with the other 10th graders isn't anything to be admired. It's more logical to say 'I don't need to play in the sandbox anymore. Let's play some football! Of course, then we get down to whether or not football is enough for you. If it's not, though, it's still not a logical reason to fuck with the first graders.</div></div><hr />

<br />
6400_Warrior could, I believe, be 7000_Warrior easily with effective effort in the same amount of time. However, if he can not ever raid and can never play for more than one hour at a time, LDoN with AP's + exp + pp + ocassional equipment drops + the rare 12HP aug isn't totally awful.<br />

.....I have gone far and wide for upgrades, and am only now getting to 5k unbuffed.<br />
<br />
It is not lack of effort, it is a lack of things being up.<br />
<br />
I'm afraid 6400_Warrior illustrates quite clearly and irrefutably (since all his gear is LDoN) that it is NOT a lack of things being up (LDoN is up 24/7), it IS in fact a lack of effort. Hit 6400HP's and then try your claim which has been conclusively proven to be false again.<br />
<br />
The nice part is that the Warriors who make the effort will be level 70 soon and hopefully you will only be comparing yourself to level 65's who do not and never did make the effort. Hopefully, they won't stop at 70 and will add 5 more levels each expansion in the future and Sturdyness 6-25 (I love AA's free improvements for just killing blue mobs - oh, at level 70 blue mobs might be a little tough for ya's.)<br />

If Gerick had invested all of his play time into LDoN since it came out and did nothing else, it is still highly doubtful that he could have gathered the points necessary to purchase all the gear in that magelo.  And I'm pretty sure you know it.  But you'd rather tweak him than to admit honestly that LDoN is a huge time sink for a mediocre return that even if you worked at it since the expansion was released, you'd still be hard pressed to walk into GoD and expect to do well.</div></div><hr />

are you dense? LDoN is not good enough in it's current state, ever heard about that guy pushing a rock up a hill for eternity? that is what LDoN is like at the moment, hardly any XP, they nerfed the cash rate and admited to it and the xp rate, it takes me a fucking year to get gear that will get mudflated to being shit in august which isn't far off, by the time I finish farming content I need from LDoN you will already be bitching about the predecessor to OoW being to fucking hard.<br />
<br />
Get it into your head, you can make these damn profiles all day, just like I can make a 12k unbuffed warrior profile, it doesnt mean it exisists or is a reasonable measure of other warriors.<br />
<br />
As it stands 5k unbuffed is not &quot;good enough&quot; as far as any class is concerned when it comes to tanking LDoN hards, but any other class that does anything but tank doesnt have to worry about this, the content is broken when your tank is required to be 1 armor teir above the group<br />

Actually, it looks to me like people started calling him one after the example of powerful folks whacking what are trivial mobs for them. I'd take BB on his word when he suggests that although he sometimes needs drops from these mobs, he tries to avoid getting in the way of people who are trying to get there for true upgrades.<br />

2. Adjust upward the Adventure Points for completing an LDoN Adventure.<br />
3. Individual quest for non-progression admission to Tower of South Ro.<br />
4. Revitialization of empty old content - I'm particularly enamored of the idea of reinsituting Fabled mobs.<br />
5. Get involved with public raiding on your server. If it doesn't exist, start it.<br />
6. If you are in a small guild, contact other small guilds and work out an alliance.<br />
7. Additional one player or small party quests.<br />
8. Improved tradeskill items using components not found behind locked content.<br />
<br />
<br />
Vikken's post in response (#422 in this thread) offers several reasonable comments. My own opinion concerning the Fabled mobs is that on my server it pretty much degenerated into a twinkage vulturefest. For folks who would like to kill a challenging mob for an upgrade, the Fabled mobs in that form were not ideal. The no-drop code was not sufficient to prevent one powerful player from soloing many of these mobs for a line of wanna-twinks who did nothing more challenging than log on and get in the chow line. My untwinked 36 SK baby alt got in a low-level group that killed the Fabled Evil Eye (which was up because his drop was trivial for twinks). Dang, now that was a fun fight (though there was a portion of it that I didn't actually see, lol).<br />
<br />
I'm very tired of seeing posts in which people bash raiders for having no life, wanting everything for themselves, blah blah blah. <br />
<br />
I'm even more tired of seeing posts claiming that casual players want uber loot handed to them for free or that we fear risk or that LDoNs render all casual complaints about the game moot. It's not really okay that LDoNs are tedious merely because other aspects of the game are tedious. If I didn't want to play for my gear or if I were really interested in avoiding risk I could easily buy some plat online and gear up in two days. I want risk, I just can't play EQ in 4-6 hour blocks very often. <br />

I beg to differ.  I said he was being an ass, not that he is an ass.  He occassionally likes to play little one upmanship games with people and comes up with fairly extreme statements just to push their buttons.  I've seen it before and it's obviouslsy something he does intentionally, just because he can.   He was being purposefully belittling just to get a rise out of Gerick and I called him on it.

<br />
Be interested to hear where those great grouping spots for 60-65 that drop better stuff is. Frankly LDoN visible armor is the best stuff 1grpable (at the level, obviously a fully GoD equipped grp can farm better). Especially if you cant get flagged high because you dont raid (the whole theme here). And dont cite sewers because how many people are going level in a grp with a 7k unbuffed tank (implying 65 and likely at least 100AAs).<br />
<br />
It also strikes me that those spots (if they exist) would be great twink farmage so they better be up consistently not on a 12hr+ spawn.<br />
<br />
Most people do 60-65 in either LDoN or Tier 2-3 PoP (PoV comes to mind). And there are no non-raid drops (hell there is very little equipment drop in any of the Tier 2-3 zones that people routinely use) that are comparable to a 1492 piece of equpment fully augged (and dont cite one piece as an example of the plethora of equipment available). <br />

People who do not enjoy or can not raid want something out of the game and that is to be able to get the power ubers have not now but eventually. Thats it...

Non-raiding folk falling behind raids by double sometimes triple in character power through AA and gear. Thats fucked. Thats all we are saying. We want that changed.

<br />
I was most struck by 6400_Warrior not using the Drooga weapons. they are quite servicable. While the Back and Belt are OK, I'd go after a CoF/CoCW and Heavy Rubicite Girdle. If that's too heavily camped, Soulscream belt at least drops in LDoN and there's always the Loyalty shield for yer back.<br />
<br />
Speaking of high AC items L'cea somthing or another drops a pretty sweet mask.<br />
<br />
Valorium Rings, or better yet - camp the FT Mask from PoJ or Boots of Flowing Slime and buy Steel Rings of Earthen Resistance. While after those Boots, don't forget to camp a Mosquito Leg Earring or two.<br />
<br />
As an altenative to camping Mosquito Leg Earring's, I don't believe the flags need to camp the parts for Bloodmetal Earring's requires all that much effort.<br />
<br />
Yes, not all players can wear Class/Diety armor, but for every race there's a generic tradeskill armor.  By all means go after an LDoN BP and Legs if you must. Fill in with the Class/Diety or generic tradeskill armor as needed. Then farm BoT and pp to pick up some Ornate molds.<br />
<br />
You need not spend 100,000 hours in LDoN to do better than 4 or even 5! K HP's as a level 65 Warrior. Of cource IF you actually camp some of the items I listed you'll get to see a bit more content than being trapped in LDoN - another benefit.<br />
<br />
Was my post inflamitory?<br />
<br />
Perhaps a little. Still a heck of a lot less inflamitory than proposing &quot;high level&quot; players get locked away from mobs they need to complete quests and virtually all salable loot in the game. BTW, I'm down to 2k pp in the bank (got Vadd's boots).<br />
<br />

If casuals want something to complain about, IMO it ought to be that CoF/CoCW is now trivial content, and probably farmed to death. True, NToV isn't that hard and there are heaste items there. But, no equivilent item afaik can be found in any instanced content that does not require flags.

I was most struck by not using the Drooga weapons. they are quite servicable. While the Back and Belt are OK, I'd go after a CoF/CoCW and Heavy Rubicite Girdle. If that's too heavily camped, Soulscream belt at least drops in LDoN and there's always the Loyalty shield for yer back.<br />
<br />
Have better, GBoS and Red epic, working on CHSD to replace red epic, have loyalty shield on back, haste is xanamech neck, loyalist shield isnt something lazy people go out for<br />
<br />
Speaking of high HP items L'cea somthing or another drops a pretty sweet mask.<br />
<br />
Who the heck is L'cea? I'll go bitch slap em tomarrow as long as it isnt ep or takes 50 level 65's geared out the ass, still using an eyepatch of plunder, something you dont get by being lazy<br />
<br />
Valorium Rings, or better yet - camp the FT Mask from PoJ or Boots of Flowing Slime and buy Steel Rings of Earthen Resistance. While after those Boots, don't forget to camp a Mosquito Leg Earring or two.<br />
<br />
Val rings? have them. earth rings are my goal but they are heavly inflated in cost, I dont have the cash needed and not many opions that will get me the cash with in a 6 month timeframe<br />
<br />
As an altenative to camping Mosquito Leg Earring's, I don't believe the flags need to camp the parts for Bloodmetal Earring's requires all that much effort.<br />
<br />
Done and done, farmed them myself already, 1 blood earring of rage(for stats) and 1 bloodmetal earring(for hp)<br />
<br />
Yes, not all players can wear Class/Diety armor, but for every race there's a generic tradeskill armor.  By all means go after an LDoN BP and Legs if you must. Fill in with the Class/Diety or generic tradeskill armor as needed. Then farm BoT and pp to pick up some Ornate molds.<br />
<br />
Um such as what for vah shir? shadowscream doesnt break 15 ac(pulling this out of my ass, but i know its really low), real fucking fair compaired to feirce heraldic and fine heraldic is so shitty the same money can buy other items that are better, orcish master greaves. I think the devs just forgot there were forced augnostic warriors... as if I dont get asked for kitty crack enough. also have ornate gauntlets and bracers<br />
<br />
You need not spend 100,000 hours in LDoN to do better than 4 or even 5! K HP's as a level 65 Warrior. Of cource IF you actually camp some of the items I listed you'll get to see a bit more content than being trapped in LDoN - another benefit.<br />
<br />
I am at 5k unbuffed and I have farmed almost all and EXCEEDED what you suggest, hitting 7k is not a cake walk. http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=23588 for example, is in my feet slot<br />
<br />
Was my post inflamitory?<br />
<br />
Perhaps a little. Still a heck of a lot less inflamitory than proposing &quot;high level&quot; players get locked away from mobs they need to complete quests and virtually all salable loot in the game. BTW, I'm down to 2k pp in the bank (got Vadd's boots).<br />
<br />
All I am saying is why not increase the spawn rates of old world mobs so that if someone hits em, big damn deal. Only lock out I would really advocate would be making a anti farming system, such as flagging them as lore, except in cases where you can use 2 of them like earrings. this way at least you dont sit in the camp all day and have 4 or 5 high ticket items other people need and could get on their own if it were not for you. this way it is the truely lazy that are the ones that have to buy plat with real money, not poor bastards like me and my guild<br />
<br />
Perhaps inflamitory, but every word of it true - the gear to do better than 4 or 5! K HP's is out there right now and it's not all in the EP's.<br />

(Nope most **your** advice only gets me to 5k, not that it is that hard to pop up alla and do a search. Fabled mith bp, fabled FFBSS with ac augment, a smatter of hp augments and i am still only 5075 so your advice, while not bad, doesnt carry you to 7k unbuffed<br />

NO OBSOFUCKINGLUTLY NOT I will not see something like the cirlce of fear turned in another VP, you dont need to be suggestion this as to be &quot;helpful&quot; just so we can see yet another one of &quot;our&quot; zones get eaten, you know the devs can not revamp worth shit, look at PoM, the hole, and AC as examples of their brainpower in added &quot;new&quot; content, all they do is beef up the monsters to bullshit levels and add more loot that causes people to swarm the content. Only zones that need revamps are the LDoN zone, not enough points or XP, period. <br />

Lcea Katta, Acrylia Embedded Visor 40AC, 25STR, 100HP's.<br />
<br />
All I am suggesting is that IMO the 6400_Warrior does not have the best available in every slot. Get at least as good in every slot as he has and you have to end up at better than 6400HP's. I don't believe gear as good or better than he is wearing is only found on LDoN Merchants or in the EP's and beyond. Also as I recall, he has Sturdyness 2 not 5. Add in 300HP's and he's really at 6700HP's.<br />
<br />
I'm happy for you that you got an FFBSS, it's a wonderful item. I'd seriously like to see SoE revitalize the game by putting fabled mobs back in and perhaps adding more. Keep them in the game permanently and even the &quot;high levels&quot; ultimately will get tired of camping them and move on to the, in all cases, better items they have access to, even for their twinks.<br />
<br />
The game is NOT broken by having open zone frequent repop less than EP quality no drop loot in it. PoP is two years old for goodness sake.<br />
<br />
As a &quot;high level&quot; raider, I am very reluctant to see others hot on my heels, in many of the same zones, and competing for the mobs I'm killing. In my view we are &quot;competing&quot; right now and the method of moving forward is the same for everyone.<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, I do play twinks. I intentionally have not leveled them to 65. They do NOT get guild support, flags, guild loot, etc. I have one Main and everyone that raids or does high level groups with me does not have the burden of outfitting my twink army. I generally (not always) pass on all LDoN loot, especially when grouping with casual players. Others do not share my attitude and that's fine. I'm no longer (I once was) opposed to helping others flag and equip lvl 65 twinks. That's their lookout, I have trouble enough maintaining my own &quot;standards&quot; and applying them to myself.<br />
<br />
My twinks suffer from the exact glass ceiliing/no raid situations complained about here except:<br />
<br />
1 major disadvantage - there are not many level 52's in the game anymore. It is excrutiatingly difficult to get groups. AND<br />
<br />
1 major advantage - they both have a rather broke but fairly powerful Dwarf Warrior that does things for them. For example, he's trying to complete the 9th and 10th Coldain Ring quest to give his 52 Paladin twink a shot at a Narandi's Helm.<br />
<br />
I think there's a happy medum between removing all flags requirements and barring high level players from &quot;bottom feeding&quot; and thereby forcing them into bankrupcy as soon as they hit QVic - the most radical &quot;casual player&quot; position<br />
<br />
AND not providing a progression path and 100 dead and useless zones.<br />
<br />
I have every reason to want to see &quot;casual&quot; content improved too. &quot;High level&quot; players do not spend all their time playing their Mains. Often, the best part of the game is not the bash your head against the wall 15 times before you succeed cutting edge content we face when we raid. Twinks can and do provide us with a holiday and allow us to redo some content that we enjoyed years ago and is still the best and most fun content in the game.<br />

<br />
Actually, it looks to me like people started calling him one after the example of powerful folks whacking what are trivial mobs for them. I'd take BB on his word when he suggests that although he sometimes needs drops from these mobs, he tries to avoid getting in the way of people who are trying to get there for true upgrades. <br />
<br />
Actually, no.  When BB first came here, the first thing I thought was &quot;Who the fuck is this clown?&quot; It pretty much looked like he was arguing JUST for the sake of arguing.  Over time, it cooled down and it looked like he actually had some well-thought out opinions and actually had a viewpoint on shit...almost like his older brother stole the comp for awhile.  Now it's back to the same ol' arguing just for the sake of arguing, no matter how ridiculous the position is.<br />
<br />
Lets fucking face it dude.  LDoN isn't progression, it isn't content that anyone wants, and for you to expect everyone else to farm 1492 armor and augment it with 1150 augs just to make it worth their while, whilst you sit and reap the 200+hp rewards is bullshit.  This weekend, i'm making a fucking magelo compendium...gear that we had thru the EQ ages between the ubers and the non heavy raiding types, and we're gonna see a striking trend....that the fact that you have double my HP and AC is bullshit.  You can claim that &quot;Oh, you'd have 6500 if you did LDON the whole time,&quot; but that's still bullshit too, because out of ALL the fucking warriors on all the servers, HOW MANY HAVE MANAGED TO GET THAT MUCH FUCKING LDON LOOT? WHILE HOW MANY WARRIORS ARE SITTING AT 8500+ UNBUFFED JUST FOR BEING MAN #53 ON A RAID?<br />
<br />
It's real funny that we see basically 2 types of magelos on this board...one of warriors who are 10k+, buffed or unbuffed, and then the rest of the knowledgable long timers who are well respected in the community are sitting between 5 and 6k unbuffed, almost exclusively.  There IS a fucking barrier here, THERE IS a fucking problem here, and you denying it just makes you look fucking foolish, because if the problem didn't exist, as you say, there would be no barrier, and there would be a linear graph of everyone's HP/AC totals on this board leading up to yours, AND THERE'S NOT.<br />

Is the 50 extra HP worth the loss in alot of other stats? Kinda hard to decide on this once because they HP and AC make up for it, but I can also keep doing DKP raids and get that nice face item off the villigers trial or off of bert.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With no PoP progression raiding because we are a fairly small guild (18 max at most), what do you propose he do to improve his character?<br />
<br />
As for myself, I am near the soft cap for casual playing also.  I guess I could farm out another 6k points for all the 40hp augs.  Joy.  That's 120 normals at half hour to 40 minutes each or 60 hards at 1 hour each.  And this is not counting LFG time, or puttnig together a group time.  So 60 hours for 200 hps increase.

There IS a progression path for you. It's just doesn't lead to 10K HP's unbuffed. It MIGHT lead to 8k HP's unbuffed with some effort, I'm not sure.

Everyone deserves to have at least something they can improve in a REASONABLE manner, and like I have said thru out this thread, you have to be a raiding warrior, paladin or SK to be allowed to tank in hard LDoNs by the other players, when shit like this becomes standard then casual warriors/paladins/sks need a leg up, there are not enough elemental+ warriors to carry every group of skirts who are to fucking stuck up to work a little harder and let me be their tank, I really have to be a tier ahead of my peers to be able to tank for them which is bullshit.<br />

Main problem is sony doesnt do itemization well, look at all the caster toys that drop from almost ever raid monster, there are even caster toy only monsters as far back as vox that were caster candy land, but how often do you see melee candy land? never and in the few cases you did (nagafen) it was grossly unpopular<br />

What fucktard thought it would be good to put each classes best armor in a differnt camp so you have to fight over which camp to do?<br />

In almost every case what anyone posts as facts, if they aren't dry statistics, are one of several viewpoints and not necessarily the &quot;best&quot; one.<br />
<br />
Let's be perfectly honest here. SoE wants to retain and get back casual players.<br />
<br />
Frodlin started a thread asking casual players what they want. That's very very good, but it is not a thread where analysis or debate will occur - he specificly discouraged it (and there are some good reasons for doing that).<br />
<br />
This thread contains a debate. No one should be able to make a bold claim like I can not (or you obviously can but you're too lazy) get to 7K HP's, I can't (can) get equipment improvents in GoD, there isn't (is) a progression path, or trivial loot code should (or shouldn't) effect ubers but not other level 65's that should have prgressed beyind KT years ago and are obviously bottom feeding.<br />
<br />
Believe me, SoE WILL analyze wether or not a contiguous progression path exits. If they are thorough enough to decide to put the Provoke line in the game and not simply add a 100 Hate always occurs component to the Taunt button, they aren't just going to reflexively drop all flagging requirements.<br />
<br />
However, I'm pretty sure they are aware the only insightful posts about game issues do not occur on their web pages or in information forwarded to them by Frodlin.<br />
<br />
So before posting things like &quot;ubers&quot; should be barred in all old content by trivial loot code and all flags should be removed, think. Think about what would truely make the game more fun everytime you log in, even if that's only 4 hours a week in 2 hour sessions. Think about what you need to make you log back in and is still fair to players that really have made more effort to identify how to &quot;beat&quot; the game given it's rules and have bent every effort toward that end for years.<br />
<br />
Frodlin's thread contains the free expression of opinions by casual players not subject to argument by high level players - that's a very necessary thing. However, post something like &quot;unlock all zones&quot; over there, and it's just as rediculous but may pass unchallanged. Post it here, and you will be asked to defend it, to prove it, and be buffeted by the opinions of others that may have wildly different needs and viewpoints than you - in fact, they might conflict.<br />
<br />
BTW, Frodlins' doing an awesome job. He's identifying issues and gathering opinions whithout forwarding an agenda. He's still entitled to an opinion and frankly I'd like to see him express it a little more on threads like this (NOT semi-official Class Correspondent threads). But he DOES need to avoid debate. We need to extend to him the courtsey of letting his personal opinion be expressed without dragging him into debate now - it's the only way we will have his sometimes very good concil and retan him as an effective and relatively unbiased advocate.<br />

Non-raiding sort of player gears up to be able to do old content with crazy small numbers like killing Vindi with one group eventually, trying NToV or whatever. We like to do shit for fun if we can get some upgrades while at it great!!! OMG!!! You saying now we dont fucking deserve better gear.... I mean come off it dude!<br />
<br />
The progression path laid out before us sucks balls as everyone here has stated. Also even if one does go through masochistic process that progression is it would put him still way behind raiders. Still not even allowing to see all of the content no matter how hard one tries. A big chunk of content. <br />
<br />
You know why ppl who quit still here and even discuss it? Cause some of us just like you have 400+ days played just on our mains. We like EQ we would like to enjoy it once again. Currently I feel its not possible to do so and I think many here think the same.<br />
<br />
I am pissed about that my casual friends who do not raid can not get anywhere near my level of gear if I stayed and raided. Why? Because current raid drops are fucking overpowered comparing to non-raid obtainable gear and because of it xp gain by non-raiders is much much slower then that of raiders.<br />
<br />
A non-raiding warrior good weapon set up would be CHSD + Sword Bloodsworn and he will be doing 80 DPS tops.<br />
<br />
While raider with DBoW + Somethin will be doing closer to 160+. <br />
<br />
Here you are a proof of double the power over non-raider. Now not only your group most likely putting out at least twice the dps, but now on top of it you get better xp spots from which non-raiders simply locked out. You keep saying there is nothing wrong with this picture.... I disagree. The difference in power of the characters should never be that fucking huge imo. Thats just comparing the DPS...<br />
<br />
Saying you deserve all these perks cause you guild raids hard content... Thats what I feel coming from all of your posts I dont agree with. Basically what this fucking does is that it puts all of the non-raiders into 2nd-class citizen group and to everyone who thinks that way I give a big FUCK YOU.</div></div><hr />

I ocassionally look at their Magelos to determine what I have to do to get where they are (a practice I've done for a  very long time - what do I have to do to get to where you are?). Not, I might add to winge and complain that the path to reach their &quot;achievements&quot; is too hard.<br />
<br />
BB<br />
<br />
Good Lord, are you dense?  No where did I say we wanted to hit 10k unbuffed.  But EQ is a game of character progress and improvement.  When that stops for someone due to RL commitments or a lack of desire to abandon friends who you started the game with, then you have nothing left to do in game.  All we want is a viable way of progression without having to raid.  Spending 60 hours at the absolute minimum grinding the same content is not a viable path of progression (despite the fact that some of us did it anyway).<br />
<br />
He has maxxed out LDoN.  With his LDoN (and small time raid targets like Korucust, Guardian of the Seal, BoT Towers, Ferubi) equipment, we can get up to Tipt and not past it.  We already do stuff like Vindi and BoT tower bosses with like 12 people.  <br />
<br />
What I am saying is that we HAVE exhausted the progression path for casual playing (read: Non-raiders), or at least nearly so.  Vxed named do not drop the gear that you need to get past Tipt.  The reward for the risk there doesn't seem balanced, unless you use a charmed pooka, which I feel is totally borked.  The drops are too meager/not powerful enough to allow one to tank higher level encounters than that.<br />
<br />
So again, what else can people who have maxxed out LDoN do to improve themselves?  The answer is...not much...unless you join a raiding guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">Without arguing the merits of your argument, what I hear is at least some non-hardcore players:<br />
<br />
1. Believe they should have a great deal of casual content available to them. Ubers have raids, y'all should have all the old content and some new content especially directed at you. LDoN alone is not enough. (I think restoring Fabled mobs and 18 player medium difficulty LDoN raids would help).<br />
<br />
2. The progression path for casual players does not match their playstyles - they raid less and are less likely to farm any environment (including LDoN) to exhausion.<br />
<br />
3. The progression path for casual players does not result in the same results as achieved by hard-core players. Either the equpment gap is too wide at the end of the road or the path is far too demanding to make it from point A to point B.<br />
<br />
In sumation, some non-hardcore players resent SoE's apparent focus on players that raid extensively and contend that their results will never be comparable and they aren't having any fun in the game they find themselves playing.<br />
<br />
I hope I got that right. Two problems -<br />
<br />
(I'm going to argue now), assume for a moment that I, as a harder-core player, &quot;D&quot; &quot;E&quot; mand that my 4 hours of raiding a night 6 nights a week provides me with greater progress than you  with your primarily experiance grouping and light raiding. The only solution I can see is providing you with an improved progression path (perhaps non-progression key quest to ToSoRo), all of us some instanced content - the medium difficulty loot dropping mob is always up (perhaps 18 person LDoN raids?), reviving old content (Fabled mobs?), new content directed at non hard-core raiders in every expansion, and SoE insuring that should circumstances change, you will if you chose be able to move over to the raid progression path or do public raiding without being two years behind hard-core raiders. Or be perfectly happy never raiding at all.<br />
<br />
The second problem of course that we went from debating wether a progression path existed at all to debating if it was too arduous and didn't end up with close enough result to what hard-core raiders &quot;get&quot;. As Frodlin observed, you will always hit a ceiling. Raiders did when they finished PoP and were waiting for GoD. New content in each expansion does little good if you can not or will not be prepared to enter it's increasing difficulty by reaching the end of the content that was previously available to you.<br />

With no PoP progression raiding because we are a fairly small guild (18 max at most), what do you propose he do to improve his character? <br />

Run GoD trials 1-6 to open up Kod`Taz and pick up some loot on the way ... there are nice augments and 1-groupable time level drops here ... then go play in ikkinz trials etc and wait for OoW.

<br />
There IS a progression path for you. It's just doesn't lead to 10K HP's unbuffed. It MIGHT lead to 8k HP's unbuffed with some effort, I'm not sure. So long as the equipment you have access to allows you to do the non-high level raid challanges you have elected (or are forced by circumstance) to persue and provides you a different progression path with steady progression, I fail to see a problem.

We've already gotten to Tipt.  We have a very hard time there.  We've only beaten it once and he even won the Heartstriker bracer, and this was only because we have an uber guild friend tanking.<br />
<br />
This is because LDoN does not give you the loot required to tank reliably there.  Neither do the few Vxed pieces you can farm.  Granted this might be a cleric problem as our clerics are not absolutely and fully maxxed on LDoN so they have smaller mana pools.  But I still maintain the thought that the drops in early GoD are not powerful or plentiful enough to allow one to get past a certain level in the trials, namely Tipt.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, elemental/time geared players can get past Tipt and into Kod'Taz with ease.  Now if only they provided some drops that were hard to get, but do not require you to get a raid flag in order to obtain so that we COULD progress.  But currently, that path does not exist.</div></div><hr />

Getting into KT isnt easy unless you're grossly overpowered.  Dont you want a challenge?? Most people i play with do and it's what keeps their butts in the seat.  EP raiding and time raiding is not easy ... neither is GoD.  If you want to progress past the &quot;soft cap&quot; of casual then you have to dig your nails in and claw forward every inch just like everyone else.  I personally get a kick out of standing up to yard trash which quads for 1300.  There is no challenge or fun killing things which done have a decent chance of killing me first.<br />
<br />
If your guild leader can buff out to 10k hps then yes he is an elemental quality tank and can stand up to Tipt stuff ... but still isnt going to be easy because it is designed to be a challenge.   More important than you tank ... how many aa's, ft does your cleric have and how deep is his/her mana pool.  Is he/she used to healing this kind of stuff??  A talented puller/healer is every bit as important as the tank ... and yeah they have to be geared for the content too.<br />

 Actually, your points aren't equally valid across players. If you're saying that ALL hardcore raiders have put in effort like, say, Haass, that's foolish. We all know of folks who gimped into highend guilds, whether because they were a required class that happened to app or because they had connections. Likewise, I can point to several people on this and other boards who don't hardcore raid, and still put in EXTREMELY large amounts of time to the game. Romidar is a good example. Raaj is another. A portion of guilds certianly bust ass in planning/organizing, but quite a few just know to hit /assist at the right time most times.</div></div><hr />

While challenge is great, you can not dispute the large difference between someone who is elemental and someone who is not.  That's what I'm complaining about.  The elemental person, just because he raids, can progress easier than someone who does LDoN.  Time commitment in this case even leans toward my friend, who I am sure spent way more time than even raiders going thru all those tortuous LDoNs.<br />
<br />
You look like someone who just got into the elementals.  And you have 7300 hps unbuffed almost.  Tell me did you spend ~360 hours getting there (550 adventures x ~ 40min each)?  That is the MINIMUM LDoN time spent only adventuring in the dungeons (not the time counting putting groups together, buffing, LFG, etc).  And despite that, he's got about 80 raw ac less than you.<br />
<br />
I am not saying I want the same quality equipment as raiders.  They should have better gear than I do, because honestly, raid targets are harder than grinding 395823958 normal ldons.  But I just feel the gap in attainable equipment is too wide between non-raiders and people who raid.  In turn, this gap stops the non-raiders at a certain point in the game, which i feel is around Vxed, Tipt.<br />
<br />
Another question remains, also.  Even if you do get past Tipt and into KoD'Taz, can he tank reliably those mobs there with LDoN gear?  I am thinking no.</div></div><hr />

As I've already proven here (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=8214), it's possible to buff past 10k hitpoints without ever raiding anything, or setting foot in LDoN.</div></div><hr />

I admit I haven't looked at VP, but I haven't heard of any VP pickup raids yet on the key mob on my server.  But again, that's the problem with it....you need to raid to get into VP, which is the crux of my problem with EQ.  The guy hits 2k and AoE 2k from what I hear.<br />
<br />
It's too bad, because if what you say is true, VP sounds perfect for my little guild.  Sigh.<br />
<br />
Btw, my guildleader can't farm Kod'taz and Ikkinz because nobody wants him to tank there because he cant tank reliably with his gear.  Maybe when more guildies make it there, we will have a shot of raiding down some of those single grouped named, but as for now, he's just got to wait either for OoW or the rest of us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u80"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p80">Tanking without a pooka killing stuff at mach 9 in tipt is pretty tough for me too.Unfortunately,that content is broken with a silly advantage going to groups with charm pets.I agree that LDON sucks for gaming quality even though I feel obligated to grind augs there and can have fun in good company.I don't want to see flagging requirements dropped for pop because I believe it would have an adverse affect on guilds trying to progress through the content.<br />
<br />
I'd like to see more content added for everyone.Especially,content starting around Sol Ro quality mobs and drops.It should be no drop to discourage farming and require doable ,but, difficult quests to zi.It could include minis that require collections of no rent or single use drops from the trash to access.Minis would be instanced and limit party /raid size variously while having the chance to drop slightly better stuff.The problem is balancing this with past content.Would anyone ever go to ssra or vt(yeah, I know raiders skip vt often ..bleh) again.I'm sure a lot of casuals would happily dismiss any advantage in raiding those,or,well any other targets.I'd rather not see all that content buried under far easier to achieve 1 group stuff though.Although level 70 ornate quality people will probably farm ssra with much smaller forces than  is the norm atm.<br />
<br />
I'd like to see more adventure content including long term quests with balanced rewards against the rest of the game.Charmed pookas should never  be the dictating factor of a zone.EP quality drops should remain very hard to come by without suffcient force.A clearer enjoyable path should be added,although,nothing should be too easy.Xp rates should also be balanced to reflect difficulty,but,move towards ep &amp; GOD style of measure.The time and effort required to gear up should be significant.If I spent all my time in one group content instead of raiding I'd have easily double to  triple my aa.<br />
<br />
PS.People keep making ridiculous judgements about raiding imo in order to better equalize with 1 group content.It's not the same and raiding gets harder has you progress.It's not like most ep raiders put in the same effort as the average dps guy on an aow raid.Wth /assist on - off...you're fired.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u87"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p87">Battleblade, you post above that it's difficult for your 52 twink to get a group, because there aren't that many lvl 52 players anymore.<br />
I think you are right about that. But I also think that this is strongly related to casual player frustrations and attrition. If being a casual player were a lot of fun, there would be loads of lvl 52 characters. They'd be doing quests and working on faction and tradeskills and tough one-group mobs that dropped usable loot and all kinds of other fun and rewarding means of progressing their characters, almost none of which actually exist, on a practical level, in the game as it's currently structured.<br />
Casual players can advance their characters. But to what end? To do normal LDoNs five minutes faster? To be ever more positive that they might be able to tank mobs in zones they are not flagged to get into? To be able to tank tough mobs on rare occasions they can raid--assuming some one-group of high-level 65s doesn't decide to farm or two-box the same mob and advise them not to &quot;whine like a little girl&quot; about it until they &quot;get off (their) ass&quot; and raid six hours a night (at which time, apparently, they would be free to whine)?<br />
Look, SONY is obligated to produce sufficient cutting edge content to challenge hardcore gamers, and that content has to provide top rewards. That seems to me to be the nature of this business: you really aren't going to stay in business if you don't present that challenge in an online environment. <br />
<br />
But you aren't going to maintain the resources to provide cutting edge content if you can't make interesting zones/progression paths for a large base of casual/non-raider players, either. LDoN is a great expansion for casual grind-and-grind-and-grind-for-loot play. It does provide access to better gear than I can get anywhere else given my circumstances, and I enjoy grinding as much as anyone, but the sameness and lack of risk in LDoN normals are not a lot of fun after a while. In fact, the most fun I've had in an LDoN was when my SK baby alt got to see the purple stick three times in one fight--and he lived and the healer lived, lol. He was lvl 26, won the dungeon, got 2 points. <br />
<br />
Have I exhausted all non-raiding possibilities in the game, no matter how boring? No, certainly not.<br />
Does that mean that as more and more expansions are released with more and more content I'll never see that I'm happy? <br />
Certainly not.<br />
If SOE continues to provide more cutting edge content in the game (as they ought) the gap between my gear and cutting-edge gear is going to grow. It has to grow: even if I were twice as &quot;good&quot; or &quot;efficient&quot; as every hardcore raider, there are a number of raiders who would still be outstripping my ability to advance, because they play five times more than I do. (And, anyway, I'm not twice as good as raiding players, lol).<br />
<br />
As this power gap widens, it becomes more and more obvious that casual players aren't in the same game as hardcore players. Forget about getting somewhere two expansions later: casual players are not likely to get some places period. So, if casual players are going to stay in the game, advancing their characters needs to be possible, but it also has to be fun in and of itself. Because they can't beat the game, they can't see the end of it, and if they get close to an end-of-it zone some /assist raider will tell them their gear sucks and they're lazy.<br />
<br />
That's why SOE had to increase the top level to 70. There's a huge difference among lvl 65 players now because they've been clumped together at the same level for a long time, but they haven't been gearing/progressing at the same rate. SOE needed to have more levels because there *are* more levels.<br />
<br />
SONY is not becoming progressively more interested in retaining casual players because there's no problem here.</div></div><hr />

I was most struck by 6400_Warrior not using the Drooga weapons. they are quite servicable. While the Back and Belt are OK, I'd go after a CoF/CoCW and Heavy Rubicite Girdle. If that's too heavily camped, Soulscream belt at least drops in LDoN and there's always the Loyalty shield for yer back.<br />
<br />
Speaking of high AC items L'cea somthing or another drops a pretty sweet mask.<br />
<br />
Valorium Rings, or better yet - camp the FT Mask from PoJ or Boots of Flowing Slime and buy Steel Rings of Earthen Resistance. While after those Boots, don't forget to camp a Mosquito Leg Earring or two.<br />
<br />
As an altenative to camping Mosquito Leg Earring's, I don't believe the flags need to camp the parts for Bloodmetal Earring's requires all that much effort.<br />
<br />
Yes, not all players can wear Class/Diety armor, but for every race there's a generic tradeskill armor.  By all means go after an LDoN BP and Legs if you must. Fill in with the Class/Diety or generic tradeskill armor as needed. Then farm BoT and pp to pick up some Ornate molds.<br />
<br />
You need not spend 100,000 hours in LDoN to do better than 4 or even 5! K HP's as a level 65 Warrior. Of cource IF you actually camp some of the items I listed you'll get to see a bit more content than being trapped in LDoN - another benefit.<br />
<br />
Was my post inflamitory?<br />
<br />
Perhaps a little. Still a heck of a lot less inflamitory than proposing &quot;high level&quot; players get locked away from mobs they need to complete quests and virtually all salable loot in the game. BTW, I'm down to 2k pp in the bank (got Vadd's boots).<br />
<br />
Perhaps inflamitory, but every word of it true - the gear to do better than 4 or 5! K HP's is out there right now and it's not all in the EP's.<br />
<br />
If casuals want something to complain about, IMO it ought to be that CoF/CoCW is now trivial content, and probably farmed to death. True, NToV isn't that hard and there are heaste items there. But, no equivilent item afaik can be found in any instanced content that does not require flags. Make something like that available in instanced content and no drop (LDoN?) and one of the more legitimate gripes goes away.<br />

BB<br />
<br />
To be honest BB I didnt bother to look at the profile. I am rounding out a full grp+ of mostly elemental+ geared guys currently and am quite familiar with the comps for alot of the best LDoN versus comparable 1grp farmable or buyable stuff. My point was that LDoN is better than much of the above you cited, better stats and resists in many cases (although occasionally lower hp) but the best part of the LDoN stuff is the tripple aug which allows you to essentially get a boatload of Attk (in the cast of warriors) without getting the uber equipoment for example. Put Ven1-4 augs (and auras) in most of the 3 slots, hps in the 2 slots, and fill out with stats/resists/AC as available and needed. It is likely less relavent to a warrior (i.e. here) than to any mana using class as many of the best 1grpable stuff is stacked with a lot of hp and no mana. My paladin who suffers the most under the current system being non-flagged beyond 1grpable (and not GoD) benefits far more from LDoN because he can get a nice slug (7-8 if I remember) of FT from LDoN which when combined with ornate and some other stuff can bring you close or to the cap.<br />
<br />
I guess my overall point is that in the unbounded world of raid equipment (at least till they fix the final zone) the definite and definitive bounds of LDoN/ornate/level appropriate 1grp stuff is very annoying.<br />
<br />
Finally, your time vs return is very appropriate up to a point, but we are talking softcap (i.e. the theoretical cap on non-raiders) here. Why would I get something like the Mosquito Leg earring which has 65hp when the LDoN ears have 75 plus far better stats, resists, and aug space. Some of the other examples are great (and I have several on my paladin) but the point is that their is a clearly visible and easily achieveable (we are talking 65 100AA+ types not pure casuals) soft-cap that has limited advancement potential. In short not enough to get deep enough into GoD to seriously upgrade. Hopefulyl OoW and 5 levels help but that sucks that non-raiders are going to be forced to buy an expansion to play an expansion they already bought.<br />

<br />
Raiding is not the only reason to gear up. Hell GoD proves the fact. Many people would love to gear up higher to take on more GoD but in keeping with recent trends (Time comes to mind) many classes have to farm the content before they can reasonable beat it (the ultimate Catch 22). Paladins come to mind. They can tank most things, AFTER THEY FARM IT FOR LOOT. Only warriors stand somewhat of a chance to succeed (along with the other memebers of the HT) of succeeding out of the box with new content. I know this board is about warriors, but the raid / non raid has problems all over the place.<br />
<br />
In the end I know its interesting to hear all the Qvic plus warriors giving lectures on where to farm in GoD, when most of them were Time farmed when they hit the expansion. Having spent the last 2 weeks roamin all unflagged areas of GoD with a mostly elemental+ equipped grp, my overall impression is that the risk reward in many areas is off a tad especially relative to xp. I get better xp rolling through the whole top of PoV than I did rolling through all the non-flagged available zones. Mobs simply have more hp and partially resist my shammy slow. I havent died in PoV in like 6 months but have died 3-4 times so far in GoD xp zones. I will admit its more fun than PoV but when you are beating down Sturdy5 you want progression not necessarily fun. Off track and time to stop....<br />

What the fuck has real life to do with that ? Because you're too busy to play EQ doesn't mean you deserve everything. Fucking ebayers, yeah those people who want 'shortcuts. <br />
<br />
Don't mix everything, complaining because single group progession &lt;&lt; raid progression = something you can argue for<br />
Complaining because there is no 'I'm a casual player and want to be as powerfull as people playing 10 times a much a me' = wrong.<br />
<br />
YOU DON'T DESERVE ANYTHING BECAUSE YOU PAY 13$ A MONTH, JUST THE 'CONNECT' BUTTON.<br />
<br />
Not everyone should have access to all the content. In fact if the game was designed correctly, no one would have access to all the content, have the time to beat everything.<br />
<br />
The problem is that there is only 1 path of progression : raid progression.  EQ needs a single group progression path, not some gimped quest that would give access to raid zone, why the fuck would people playing in group get access to raid content ? Single group progression should be just ... a completely different path, with different zone.</div></div><hr />

ToV is certainly an unflagged zone.  But I have some serious doubts about the ability of a single group or even two to clear the trash (including flurry drakes which used to regularly own a 7k buffed Warrior using defensive back when I was playing in there) and take out the bosses and not already be geared past what they drop.</div></div><hr />

Certainly the Ornate molds for BP and legs are sold for a fair amount and I don't think (am not sure) they can drop in BoT. So, OK for these two pieces, Royal Attendant makes sence and is not so mind numbing to be ludicrous.<br />

Break da rulz and acquire Bloodmetal Earrings and Steel Rings of Earthen Resistance. A nip here a tuck there - add some LDoN 10AC, 40HP and 20HP/20End augs a yoiu are looking at 7k-7500HP's..<br />
<br />
Like I said enough to get started in GoD and enough to break into the EP's BUT sooner or later (sooner I suspect) you hit that ceiling where it's raid or you're are progressing no further until the next expansion.<br />
<br />
On my server, the last raid busses are pulling out of the station. 5 guilds (on the order of 500 peeps) are or have been in PoTime. Maybe 3 are in VT and a few do the EP's. The raiding guilds and perhaps 25% of my server's population are moving on.<br />
<br />
If you think doing ToV and Flurry Drakes is tough, then wait till you see the EP gods and PoTime if you do. You don't even want to think about Uqua.<br />
<br />
All above are raid zones. The only real way to see them and clear them is raid, public raid, guild alliance raid. Did I mention raid?<br />
<br />
The idea ToV might not be accessable without raiding isn't a foreign concept. The same could be said of Seru/VT or PoTime, or Inkta'Tu. This is not new guys. It's been true of every expansion. There's some content that you don't do without raiding and being sufficiently geared from previous content to attempt.<br />

<br />
This highlights how out of touch with casual raiding you are.  The casual guild I have been raiding with as Vig set a few different Doze raids.  On only one occassion was Doze actually spawned.  I'd estimate three groups were present - it was a huge turn out.  The fight took us around 13 minutes. <br />
<br />
Could we have done it with less?  Yeah, probably, but we'd have had to weed out the lower level or lesser equiped friends and guildmates.  Could a single group of nonraiders have killed Doze?  Maybe if they were some of the servers best non-raiders.  But only so many people can be the servers best non raiders. <br />
<br />
More to the point, have you LOOKED at those quests in the last few years?  The only quest worth having is the speed bracer, purely to get speed into an off-slot.  <br />
<br />
Raiding TOV was the funnest thing I can remember in EQ, ever.  I'd crawl the halls of testing tons more times, just for fun.  But I wouldn't recommend to a non-raider to do it for gear upgrades because I don't view most of those quests as significant upgrades and I do view Doze as a serious cockblock.</div></div><hr />

Bullshit ... there are about 5-10 nice items which come out of the HoT quests ... i reccomend you go back and examine these again as several have 41% haste and/or nice ac/stats/saves + 100hp.  ome of them are nice ... some of them are decent, and all of them would upgrade you (well maybe not all).</div></div><hr />

No one claimed otherwise.  Vikken however is presenting a magelo with the concept that a non-raider or casual raid guild member might be able to obtain the gear.

Actually if you read his posts you would notice that he wasnt referring to casuals/non-raiders ... but rather he was talking about gear which could be obtained with 1-6 groups from zones not locked.

<br />
If you absolutley dead set on having the best gear available without having to leave your guild, or flag everyone in it. If you would like the best gear possible without having to bring along your 72 closest friends, this is your cap, or very near it.<br />
<br />
The gear in that magelo isn't for someone who can only log on for a few hours at a time, or are unwilling/unable to work with your guild finding raid targets that are doable by a small guild with a usual raid size of 24 members or so.<br />
<br />
I put this together to see just how far you could go without leaving your current guld behind (assuming they are of the same progression) to join a zerg force.<br />
<br />
It is in no way/shape/form casual or non-raider. I just wanted to find out how close one could get to full blown without going UBER-RAIDER (if there is such a thing).<br />
<br />
I think this profile display a fair realistic example of what you could attain, and I think this character you be very well equiped for the content he faces. I could be wrong though. Feel free to post you poinions and thoughts on the profile, i would like it to be as accurate as possible. Maybe I missed some stuff, or something is included that really isn't viable, or hell, even in the game. I ran into a bunch of stuff from the old AC ring event that aren't in the game anymore. it's those kind of details that I need to know, simply because I can't know everything about each piece and the logistical issues that go along with them. Like I said, I'm not and have never been at this level of the game, I'm just feeding off of stat, spawn, and zone information I can glean off of Alla's.<br />
<br />
Maybe afterwards I can go back a make up a non-raider version we can use as reference. I've have already done the LDoN, and in my opinion that while maybe incredibly boring and tedious, LDoN does offer the most bang for your /played buck for truely casual players that can only log in 1 or 2 hours at a time a few days a week. But right now, I'm concentrating on one step down from flagged raiding (VT, EP, GoD raid progression), which is a significant shift in playstyle from unflagged due to the sacrifices one must make to advance past that point.<br />

Actually, we've made a huge amount of progress. When we started out some posters claimed they were trapped at 5-6K HP's with no casual path at all to move them forward. Now these same individuals have conceeded there IS a casual path. They have two objections to that casual path:<br />
<br />
1. They don't like where it leads. Some content and equipment is locked behind guild progression content doors.<br />
<br />
2. They contend either that it requires some casual raiding (the ToV Magelo) or alternately requires too much LDoN (the LDoN Magelo) to progress.<br />
<br />
There have been some suggestions to improve the casual path, I've made some myself. I'd say suggesting improvements is tantamount to agreeing there's room for improvement AND things aren't as hopeless as some paint them, else why bother?<br />
<br />
I believe that if some of you are looking for radical change instead of nice improvements headed in the right direction, you might be disappointed.<br />
<br />
The depth of some expressions of bitterness and distortion may be a signal that nothing is likely to please you rather than SoE better freaking reinvent EQ from the ground up - Chop chop!<br />
<br />
In the last couple of weeks I've been seeing piles of old acquaintences logging in. I suspect it's because they have lost interest in the latest video game, vacation's over, they figure GoD's been cracked and now they want to be counted in, and/or they are re-establishing contacts in anticipation of a new expansion (happens every time). I also suspect when Doom 3 comes out in 10 days, they'll disappear yet again.<br />

I suppose I should post a purpose for these. Often in the threads, we throw around numbers and assumptions on what available to other playstyles. These profiles I have made up are intended to be a max effort from each playstyle. Ofcourse not everyone will reach these stats within each given playstyle, but atleast we can look at tell, IN CONCRETE TERMS, what the given hard cap is before having to move into the next playstyle.<br />

I have 3 types, there are actually 4 that I can tell, but I'll explain in a bit.<br />
<br />
Type A - This is the hardcore raiders. They are progressing through cutting edge raid content. This involves tedious flagging/keying and farming content to gear up for the next tier. These guys are the first to find the stuff that makes you go, Wow!<br />
<br />
Type B - These guys raid whenever they can so long as they don't have to leave their guilds to raid it, or flag/key their whole guild to raid with them. Single group flags/keys are acceptable.<br />
<br />
Type C - These guys have limited play hours, usualling in less than 2 hours stretches. They can't do long raids, nor long single group content. They may play many hours a week, maybe just as many as hours total played a week as the other Types, just not in more than 2 hour stretches. Note: This can actually be broken into 2 groups, those that raid and those that don't. The difference is small enough IMO to lump them together though.<br />
<br />
Ok, now the magelos...<br />
<br />
Type A - I haven't done yet, I'm not sure I will as this is pretty far removed from my experiences.<br />
<br />
Type B - http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1074730<br />
<br />
Type C - http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1074992<br />
<br />
Type C will need adjustment. I simply used most of the gear available from LDoN and buyable in the Bazaar.<br />
<br />
Type B was working earlier, as I used it in an earlier post, but for whatever reason, Magelo is acting up, and is now showing an old profile. There's no need to comment unless you see lots 1700ac or so, ToV gear and a BoC mainhand.<br />
<br />
For a baseline comparison, I've maxxed all AAs and skills.<br />
<br />
Now I just gotta figure out where all that work I put into the B profile went...sigh...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u115"><b>Tooby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p115">1. As you have 10-20 times the number of days played the fact that your hp, ac and dps is about twice mine seems fair.<br />
<br />
2.With every expansion, old zones' loots and targets become redundant as you can cheaply get the same or better quality loot in the bazaar. As a result beautifully designed zones (mistmoore, Lguk, SolB, Najena) get more and more redundant. This seems to be a waste to me. The Fabled mobs was a good thing in this way, and adding some no drop Loot (about the quality of ldon drops at the appropriate level) really shouldnt hurt anyone.<br />
<br />
3. Old keys. I really think they should become easier as the loot they are guarding become worse. Loot is completely relative and i think that allowing casuals to access 4 expansion old content without having to do an equally time consuming quest as when the reward was state-of -the art equipment is pretty fair. Im not asking that it becomes easier (as in easier encounters) - maybe they should even be harder to make up for the tradable gear available and a higher level cap, but some of the time sinks could surely be reduced since those are to a large extent what makes some such quests unfeasible to a casual familly style guild. Spawnable flag/key mobs (if without loot then so be it) as discussed above is also an ineresting idea.<br />
<br />
4 Trivial loot code, i think it would be sad if this was necessary to allow younger guilds to progress. Part of the charm of improving, is that the things that was hard once upon a time is suddenly trivial. In addition it really makes little sense from a story-line perspective (you grow so big that you can no longer fit through the door??) and it really messes up quests.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u116"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p116">3. Old keys. I really think they should become easier......<br />
The VT and Seru keys are unbelievably easier now than when I did them. The quality of equipment available is a heck of a lot better.<br />

4 Trivial loot code, i think it would be sad if this was necessary<br />
This is the most grasping at straws non-issue I've even seen. Should SoE do this except to protect flag mobs and I through some kind of miracle continue playing, I would hope they would tie it to level - If at level 65 you are still hunting CoF's except to sell, you aren't a &quot;new&quot; guild, you're 16 years old and still in the 2nd grade. CoF's drop in content originally done by level 50's.<br />

I'll simplify it to one line, since you only read a sliver of the post I linked:<br />
<br />
7268 (base) + 367 (Gates augs) + 618 (Nine) + 544 (Seventh) + 910 (Kazad) + 330 (Brell) = 10037hp<br />

<br />
<br />
I think you have C and B switched around.<br />
<br />
Also I think the currect profile for c is kind of unfair, Only a select few can use fierce heraldic, put something else in those slots, also that profile has maxxed AA's<br />
<br />
I am very close to the &quot;typec&quot; profile, the only reason he has a lead is the 500 hp from sturdiness and the other HP increasing AAs and a small bit more thanks to those rings (which I do not think are fair to say are casual, elemental crafted and cost alot)<br />
<br />
So we see the max someone like me can hit is about or little over 6k and that is with all the tanking AAs, This means that I am still 500p less than the standard warrior for LDoN hards so I think I am fucked<br />
<br />
But you did say max effort so I guess that counts farming spiderling silks :D I would change the neck to the woven shim collar, that is a raid you can do without leaving your guild.<br />
<br />
I think with a few HP augments to the typec profile and the max that could be hit would be 7k, with current LDoN gear costs the armor he has would probibly take him 25 to 30ish days of combined play time to gather, thats 720 hours unaugmented, and remember that you can not do hards until you break 6k</div></div><hr />

<br />
OK, so shoot me your comments, make sure you read the caveats I posted with the profiles. Main one being MAX effort. Single groups for TypeC. Unflagged raids/1 groupable flagged/keyed for TypeB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u124"><b>Groovdog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p124">What the fuck has real life to do with that ? Because you're too busy to play EQ doesn't mean you deserve everything. Fucking ebayers, yeah those people who want 'shortcuts.<br />
<br />
Who said anything about wanting everything? Wanting something possible beyond current full LDoN/1grp (non-raider) equipment? Raiders have at least 2 progressions beyond that (PoP and GoD). I fully believe that one level gap should exist permanently between the two but flagging is beginning to widen the gap to the point where much of the content done in the last 2 years is either irrelevant (LoY) or unaccessable (ToSR+, and much of GoD) to the majority. LDoN is good but needs more work and more thought put into it. This is for a 65 with any reasonable setup who is a non-raider.<br />
<br />
<br />
Don't mix everything, complaining because single group progession &lt;&lt; raid progression = something you can argue for<br />
Complaining because there is no 'I'm a casual player and want to be as powerfull as people playing 10 times a much a me' = wrong.<br />
<br />
Bullshit. Single grp progression should always be &lt; raid or raiding would die. It should be as robust but not =. I have never said I want to be as powerful (although I do admit some casuals feel this way) as people playing 10x as me (these dont exist, btw, physically impossible, but that is not your point). I just dont think an uberraider should be at 12k hp unbuffed and find a hardcore non-uberraider at 6500-7000k unbuffed. Many non-ubers spend more time playing than ubers but just dont raid. That flys in the face of what you are saying.<br />
<br />
<br />
YOU DON'T DESERVE ANYTHING BECAUSE YOU PAY 13$ A MONTH, JUST THE 'CONNECT' BUTTON.<br />
<br />
This is the saddest statement I have read on these boards. I deserve to have fun, to feel able to progress, i.e. enjoy myself within reason. If I cant I wont play, I wont pay, and this game (if enough people agree) will die. I am sick and fucking tired of people who think that just because this game hasnt died to competition that it can't. They dont call it evercrack for nothing. Status quo is fine for some but when other better things come along and SOE doesnt react then they will lose.<br />
<br />
<br />
Not everyone should have access to all the content. In fact if the game was designed correctly, no one would have access to all the content, have the time to beat everything.<br />
<br />
I agree generally with this but it should be 5% of content not available to 95%+ of the people not 50+% of content done in the two largest expansions done in the last 2+ years (GoD/PoP) not available to 85% of the people. LoY and LDoN were casual bones but they helped raiders somewhat as well. The same can be said of GoD/PoP in some ways, but the actual content of the casual expansions is crap. The real depth and story (even if you dont like it) and the original zones are all raider focused.<br />
<br />
The problem is that there is only 1 path of progression : raid progression.  EQ needs a single group progression path, not some gimped quest that would give access to raid zone, why the fuck would people playing in group get access to raid content ? Single group progression should be just ... a completely different path, with different zone.<br />
<br />
Agreed but not doable. The raiders would burn through the content too fast and would have nothing to do. So SOE needs a way to keep casuals happy (i.e. better progression) while focusing on the raiders. I am not anti-raider, just anti-raider who wants all the spoils to themselves, all the time, and 2-3 years after the fact.<br />

<br />
Certainly the Ornate molds for BP and legs are sold for a fair amount and I don't think (am not sure) they can drop in BoT. So, OK for these two pieces, Royal Attendant makes sence and is not so mind numbing to be ludicrous.<br />
<br />
Break da rulz and acquire Bloodmetal Earrings and Steel Rings of Earthen Resistance. A nip here a tuck there - add some LDoN 10AC, 40HP and 20HP/20End augs a yoiu are looking at 7k-7500HP's..<br />
<br />
Like I said enough to get started in GoD and enough to break into the EP's BUT sooner or later (sooner I suspect) you hit that ceiling where it's raid or you're are progressing no further until the next expansion.<br />
<br />
On my server, the last raid busses are pulling out of the station. 5 guilds (on the order of 500 peeps) are or have been in PoTime. Maybe 3 are in VT and a few do the EP's. The raiding guilds and perhaps 25% of my server's population are moving on.<br />
<br />
If you think doing ToV and Flurry Drakes is tough, then wait till you see the EP gods and PoTime if you do. You don't even want to think about Uqua.<br />
<br />
All above are raid zones. The only real way to see them and clear them is raid, public raid, guild alliance raid. Did I mention raid?<br />
<br />
The idea ToV might not be accessable without raiding isn't a foreign concept. The same could be said of Seru/VT or PoTime, or Inkta'Tu. This is not new guys. It's been true of every expansion. There's some content that you don't do without raiding and being sufficiently geared from previous content to attempt.<br />
<br />
BB<br />
<br />
Well put but I would beg to differ on the last paragraph. That has been true in the past but how do you gear up for GoD in PoP/LDoN with the flagging issues(PoP)? I think its less true of GoD (and why I dont like the expansion) than in the past. <br />
<br />
There is almost a barrier to entry (either actual or perceived) that is stopping a lot of people in their tracks. And for the record, I recognize that their will always be superior players who will find ways around every obstacle. The game cant be DESIGNED for those people or the majority (who keep the game alive) will just be overwhelmed.<br />
<br />
Does that mean dumb it down? No. Just make it challenging rather than impossible. Many feel that things are too close to impossible to justify their investment of time.<br />
<br />
Is it a statement on our society, maybe, but it reflects reality, something a BUSINESS can never look beyond.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u126"><b>Groovdog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p126">Apolyon so you are the example of well equiped casual yes?<br />
Are you saying you are content being &quot;half a man&quot; BB is and know thats it you can never be even close to him without leaving your guild?<br />
<br />
I know I wouldnt be. You know why? Cause when I was in a raiding guild and my friends weren't when I played with them it felt like I am fucking pling them and I think we all know how much fun that is.<br />
<br />
This in turn makes any kind of relationship between raiders and non-raiders impossible except for social one.<br />
<br />
Yep with no guild currently this is exactly how I feel. Any guilds whose playtime specs I can meet on my server now would have me as the MT out front by 1.5k hp (and by weps so far ahead of that as not to be reasonable).<br />
<br />
So I 6box to pass the time, and occasionally grp with others for the social aspect. The whole no more LDoN armor thing has basically convinced me the non-raider (EP+) game is not gonna be what I would like so maybe I will just go help others (i.e. not personally progress other than xp,aa, and 70)  and get my pleasure that way. No matter what I do or think I am done with this topic. The horse has been beat dead and I will resolve myself (being the argumentative person I freely admit to be) to the fact that opinions are like assholes, everyone has one.<br />
<br />
GD<br />
<br />
And BB I agree some things have progressed a little but there is not enough consensus on the raider side (who is far more vocal than the majority) to make a difference. Hence this has pretty much been a waste of time on the part of those of us who feel the single progression path needs work (not that it doesnt exist).</div></div><hr />

This is exactly my point, getting 50 people work together is much much much harder than getting 6 people working together. Risk vs Reward, raiding should always be more rewarding, at least for the guilds that are successful at it.<br />

<br />
You deserve right as much as everyone else playing the game, no matter how much busy RL you are. If you can't play at least 15-20 hours a week, really, you shouldn't be playing a MMORPG and complain you don't have fun. Don't play a MMORPG you have no fun in, there are plenty around worth a shot, and fortunately they are not (yet) all the same.<br />
EQ will die for casual players the day WoW and EQ2 will be released, SoE should NOT try to keep them on this game, people that will stay in EQ are those that like the high end EQ, ie large scale raiding, that will NOT be found in either game. <br />

There are ~ 10 zones not avaible to not 'hardcore raiders' (ie 6 in pop, 5 in god) there are over 100 zones, so yeah that's over 90% of the content avaible to the 'not high end raider'.<br />
<br />
<br />
Agreed but not doable. The raiders would burn through the content too fast and would have nothing to do. So SOE needs a way to keep casuals happy (i.e. better progression) while focusing on the raiders.

<br />
It is doable, with instancing, I hate instancing, but yet that's a cheap way to provide content for a lot of people. See Ikkinz, used for both single group event and raids, see LDoN, zones used for raids and single group adventures. It can be done, and should be done. Why isn't there an 'uqua' single group, an 'Inktu ta' single group ?<br />
Check Ikkinz single group reward, and ikkinz raid reward, you'll see that, omg, it's balanced(50 hp augment in single group, 70 in raid for example is really the kind of difference that should be) ! SoE can do it if they want to.</div></div><hr />

Bull, the average warrior is 6k unbuffed, not 7.5k to 8k, going by megalo's if a fucked way to go about it since alot of players dont bother with it.<br />

I'd like to see your proof of what an &quot;average&quot; warrior is, I know what an average warrior is because every time I lead something I go down the warrior pecking order.<br />
<br />
We have 1 uber being a nice guy come in and tank for us now and then, normally 8500+ and about 4 or 5 other warriors, most of them are just under 6k and half the time I end up as the third tank or second tank (or when no warriors show up I tank the stuff, have had to on a blizzard raid and a xanamech PUraid)<br />
<br />
Most of the game, acording to brenlo is below 60(not counting mules, they had a control to keep those out) if you go by what megalo says you wont see more than 5 megalos under level 50 on this board alone, the only exceptions is the &quot;gear up&quot; posts in the bunker.<br />
<br />
trust me, I am living it and your not, you are expectionally well geared for where you are in the game, but dont expect each of us to be the max non-raider or the max casual, or the max no hive guild possible as there are only a few endgame warriors with everything possible filled in.</div></div><hr />

You have tossed an isolated few &lt;Turbo Raiders&gt; into the spotlight and paraded them around as the norm.  <br />

Here's a clue:  the average &quot;raider&quot; in the PoP/EP/Time era is farting around with 7-8.5k hps ... you dont even begin to get higher than that until you've farmed the hell out of time, raided GoD extensively, and spend 100's of hours farming augments from LDoN raids and GoD ... of which only a select few server-wide have taken the time to do.<br />

You pull the same shit, someone who has the luck of the irish and all the friends to help him MAY get to 7.5k to 8k, as you basically said, yet it is not ok for me and others to bring up the high end super raiders? dont you think we just did the exact same thing?<br />

&quot;Average &quot;top of the line&quot; non-raiding warrior is pushing 7.5-8k hps.&quot; isnt even a real fucking sentance dipshit, and average is when you add it ALL up and / by the number of subjects in the problem, by saying &quot;top of the line&quot; you just butchered the word average, nice work assclown.<br />

Average non raiding warriors fall in the 5500-6k range.  Average raiding warriors fall in the 7-8k range.  In both cases you will find isolated pockets of warriors who violate these norms depending on where they or their guild is in progression.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u139"><b>Khumak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p139">There's a rather large difference between the game that the casual level 1-65 player is playing and the one that the level 65 raider is playing.  The only casual players who are even remotely competing for the same types of groups that the raiders are going for are the ones that are level 65 with lots of AAs and who tend to gravitate to the hardest single group content they can find rather than the easiest &quot;xp grind&quot; camps.<br />
<br />
I haven't played anything other than my main character in 4 years so I'm not really even qualified to comment on sub 60 content anymore.  I have no clue what it's like now.  The last time I was less than level, 50 SSoY and FBSS were still uber.<br />
<br />
So with that out of the way I will only comment on the level 60+ game.  I was in a casual guild from level 54 to level 65 so I do know what it's like to be a non raider during that level span.  There's plenty of stuff to do up until you hit level 65 as a casual player.  Once you hit level 65 if you plan on developing your character further there is a definite progression path to follow as a casual player.  <br />
<br />
One path starts with tradeskill and bazaar gear if you have the money for it.  The other starting point is Ornate armor or LDON.  Both of those take a large time commitment.  There are ZERO progression paths available to anyone that don't involve a large time commitment.  This is by design.  If there was a progression path that was easy and didn't take much time that would be the path that everyone would start with and people would have quit long ago because there is nothing left to do.<br />
<br />
As I see it the basic progression options for a player once he hits level 65 and has most of the useful AAs are to:<br />
<br />
1.  Seek out a relatively tight nit, hardcore group of people to do cutting edge single group content with.<br />
2.  Join a raid guild.<br />
3.  Start an alt and basically make that your main.<br />
4.  Quit.<br />
<br />
Option 1 allows you to progress almost as far as a raider but requires a similar time commitment and a similar level of difficulty but no scheduling issues.  Option 2 lets you see all of the current end game content but requires a serious time commitment and can lead to significant schedule issues.  Option 3 is basically for the person who enjoys the low level game as much or more than the high level game or the person who plays more for social interaction than to actually develop their character.  Option 4 is for the person who wants to see all the content and get all the best gear without putting in the work for it... Sorry, ain't gonna happen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u140"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p140">The thing is, there is a thread that spells out where ANY warrior can, with a single group get 10khp buffed doing ONLY gates of Discord single group content PRE-KodTaz.  It even gives you links and mobs that drop the gear.    <br />
<br />
Gerick, you yourself are starting to see the positives of GoD aren't you?   Didn't you say just a few posts up that you're now hitting up Riwwi more regularly and not only putting on some of the gear, and camping some of it yourself, but are selling some for a nice chunk of cash?   <br />
<br />
Some of the other zones are harder than Riwwi, but still completely manageable.   I'd recommend Barindu next after you've depleted Riwwi.   After Barindu, hit up Sewers, then Ferubi/Vxed/Tipt.    <br />
<br />
There's a GOLDMINE of gear in GoD that's attainable without a single raid, it's ALL out there and it's ALL obtainable.   You have to go get it.    If you want an apple, and there's a tree nearby, you must reach up and grab the apple, or you'll become very hungry waiting for it to fall off the tree and hit you in the head.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u142"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p142">I agree that AC is a problem; this is a problem for any equipment set that is not warrior-only.  The route to AC is, sadly, through augments and tribute.  You can add about 200 AC to any profile using single-group pre-Kodtaz obtainable augments, and I believe you get about 65-70 AC from tribute.  No, this will not get you into the 1800-2000 AC range, but it will get you above 1600.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Frodlin, I understand that there is good GoD gear obtainable through single-group events.  I have read through that thread and looked at the magelo.  Two things, though, bear some discussion.<br />
<br />
The first is that very little of that GoD equipment is an upgrade in the 8 primary slots from LDoN.  Several peices of the set are 75 hitpoints and below and several more are significantly lacking in AC, which is of absolutely necessity in GoD.  The GoD upgradable gloves are arguably worse than my Velious gloves and I obtained those gloves four expansions ago.  What I guess I am saying is when you are talking about an expansion that is yielding a 230HP helm, I'm not sure I'd dignifiy a 75HP helm as a &quot;Goldmine&quot; of opportunity.  Absolutely, the Qvic+ gear should be superior, and I'm not arguing otherwise, but the extreme difference between those two items is staggering.  With that in mind, I don't appreciate the condescending tone of the quoted text, even if the intent was to be helpful.<br />
<br />
The second point is that the GoD gear is available in theory, but we are still subject to the RNG.  I put in hours each night and I will continue to put in hours for upgrades.  But in the GoD thread you have several people stating that it has taken them around 70 hours of farming just the mountain trials alone (which account for only three upgrades on that GoD magelo) for the upgrades there and all for naught.  So, YES, the equipment is available and it should absolutely take effort to acquire it, but I'm not sure if 70+ hours for three peices of gear (which mind you haven't actually been acquired yet, so more time is needed) is the fair equivalent for an item 1/3 as good as gear dropping in Qvic.  We are talking about gear from the same expansion that gives raiders a ridiculously wide power advantage over nonraiders. Again, in preparation for what I know will be the response, I understand that Qvic gear should be superior given the time and effort it takes to get there.  But I question the degree of superiority in the gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u144"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p144">The first is that very little of that GoD equipment is an upgrade in the 8 primary slots from LDoN.

<br />
So the clear answer is to suit yourself with the 8 Armor pieces from LDoN and the rest from GoD isn't it?.   The point is that you can, ONLY in GoD gain 10khp.   That doesnt' prevent you from attaining LDoN armors, it's just giving you additional opportunities.   <br />
<br />
Just because ALL of the options in GoD single group dropped gear aren't the best available doesn't make it not a goldmine.  it IS a goldmine.   What's even more fascinating is that once you've got the gear that's been discussed, once you've snagged a Jhiru bracer, a WHOLE NEW level of one group attainable gear opens up for you, and some great 2-3 group gear as well.   <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
What I guess I am saying is when you are talking about an expansion that is yielding a 230HP helm, I'm not sure I'd dignifiy a 75HP helm as a &quot;Goldmine&quot; of opportunity. Absolutely, the Qvic+ gear should be superior, and I'm not arguing otherwise, but the extreme difference between those two items is staggering. <br />
<br />
Let's be serious here for a minute.   Six weeks.   Six weeks is the average time a guild spends from the time they enter Uqua till the time they kill Barxt.   Som less some more, but the AVERAGE is six weeks.   That is going into the SAME zone 3 times a week, getting PLASTERED left and right, failure after failure after failure, each little &quot;step&quot; being a huge victory with no result (2 substandard loots from Tqivs for a night's worth of work doesnt' justify the time/frustration spent).   This is paid off with Qvic, which is a goldmine, but it's delayed gratification.   The 70 hours of farming while getting exp and AA's is FAR less than the time spent in Uqua for essentially, nothing special with an exp net loss on a daily basis.   <br />
<br />
Finding the weakest sets of the gear and comparing it against the best sets of the gear to find an inherent &quot;unfairness&quot; is insane.    How about the slots that you CANT get via LDoN?  There's plenty.  How about the fact that most of the items are droppable and saleable for a LOT of cash?<br />
<br />
Furthermore, there's gear that is available once post Jhiru (you'll note that EVERY mob is in unlocked zones that's listed there), which is 1-3 group acquirable that is Time level quality.   I needn't point out Glyphed Prayer rings, Earrings of Destructive Essence, Carved Vrex totems, Dauntless Muramite rings, Incantor Masks of Death, which are ALL one groupable.   There's also 180hp/30AC shoulders from a 2 groupable encounter, a 40AC, 175hp mask from a 2 groupable encounter (and yes, it's EASY with ANY 2 groups as long as there's 2 clerics and an enchater or 2), and all type 8 augs as well, which ALSO drop form those same areas.   <br />
<br />
With that in mind, I don't appreciate the condescending tone of the quoted text, even if the intent was to be helpful.<br />
<br />
Keep tone out of it, it serves nothing but to inflame.   Just like you object to being called whiny, fatalistic and pessimistic, I object to being called condescending.</div></div><hr />

In addition, even those goldmine slots are terribly weak on AC. A midrange set of class specific, quested gear (a'la champs, ornate, elemental, vadds) would go a hell of a long way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then don't talk to me about being hungry and waiting for apples to fall on my head, because regardless of what you like being called, that statement is condescending.<br />
<br />
Look at my profile.  Now look at my dream profile.  I am well aware of EXACTLY what GoD has to offer me and EXACTLY what other slots I need to upgrade through other avenues.  I don't need you talking to me of wanting free apples. <br />
<br />
The discussion here is two-fold.  First, the creation of arbitrary barriers to content.  Second, the lack of an alternate progression path for hard core non-raiders.  Pointing me to GoD gear that has between 75-85HP on most slots is not useful.  Most of my gear has that now and until three weeks I hadn't played Vigdis in 18 months. <br />
<br />
<br />

There's plenty. How about the fact that most of the items are droppable and saleable for a LOT of cash?<br />
<br />
First off, your statement that most of the items are droppable is not true.  Look at The Magelo Again (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1071587).  Exactly one piece of gear on that magelo is droppable and it has 70HP. <br />
<br />
Secondly, according to your &quot;goldmine&quot; opportunity post, GoD armor was not &quot;the weakest sets of gear.&quot;  In fact, you can perview an entire thread in the Bunker that discusses how great this armor is.  It's only in comparison with Qvic that it looks ridiculous.  Of course, it also looks ridiculous when compared with elemental gear, from three expansions ago, and this power advantage gap is what sparked the LDoN debate.  Even then, I see an entire thread in the Bunker dedicated to making me, the hard core non-raiding player, feel blessed that I can acquire this gear.  Yes, there are several upgrades here.  When you look at my dream profile you'll see that I've listed the ones that truly are the best upgrades to be found.  But when I put on the hat of my raiding enchanter, I can tell you that none of that is an upgrade past what is available in VT or EP.</div></div><hr />

You people are either deaf dumb and blind or so stubbornly married to your position even plain logic doesn't get through. Because I've already posted this once, I'm just going to repost.  I posted my original reply in response to, Apolyon, who loves to say AMEN BRUTHA AMEN! here, but utterly ignored it.  <br />

<br />
No. This is wrong. This is the propoganda that raiders choose to believe. It has been posted by Apolyon 20 times in this thread, by BB just before, by Aidya in some blathering tirade earlier, and by several other well-meaning but disillusioned raiders. <br />
<br />
This debate is not about casuals versus raiders. This debate is about non-raiders versus raiders.  So that our definitions match, lets discuss what I mean by &quot;non-raider.&quot; I mean an individual who dedicates his or her non-work time to playing Everquest, invests in upgrading his or her character with gear and new content experiences, and plans for the future. <br />
<br />
It may not be kosher to identify a player who posts on this form but because I was so impressed, I'll do it anyway and hope he doesn't mind. Brutonius is a warrior on Povar who is guilded with Heroes Unlimited, an very small guild. When I first started replaying Vigdis three weeks ago and I looked at the eqrankings for Povar I saw his Magelo above several EP-guild warriors and I saw the tag after his name and I assumed he had created a faux magelo with EP gear. To my surprise he had not. <br />
<br />
Brutonius has 7264 HP unbuffed. If you look at his magelo you'll see that he has max auged the Tak BP and arms, and has a number of other Hard LDoN peices. He also has the Tipt bracer, and several other GoD farmed peices. He has maxxed his HP AA. I patterned my own dream profile after his, once I had confirmed it through my own Ally's searches of course. When the new VP quests were released I immediately updated my own dream profile to reflect that and was not at all surprised that Brutonius had done likewise with his dream profile. <br />
<br />
This is a profile of a non-raider (or at least a non &quot;hard core EP raider&quot;) http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profi...um=217047&amp;alt=0. His HPs beat out the raiding Apolyon's and several other half-raiders on this thread. <br />
<br />
So don't tell me that non raiders don't wish to put in the effort. I have stated on countless occassions that it simply isn't true. Non raiding players put in hours of effort into this game.</div></div><hr />

BattleBlade, I do appreciate you taking the time to underscore my point so succinctly. The % increase IS going down, between Raex and Vadds. However we're not complaining about that. The percentage gap between ornate and ldon is trivial. And the percentage gap between LDoN and Raex is astronoical.<br />
<br />
Comparing AC,<br />
Ornate-&gt;LDoN is 5.3% improved (granted, LDoN has more aug slots to fill)<br />
LDoN -&gt; Raex is 57% improved<br />
Raex-&gt;Vadds is 9.1% improved<br />
<br />
My friend, that is not called progression. It's called a discontinuity. A break in the progression. Even augged ldon isn't going to hold a candle to Raex. Since you were so beefed up going from kunark droppable armor to kael raid armor, lets compare that.<br />

Given theres a huge hp gap there, but all the velious gear has that HP, and PoG gear was attainable without flags or necessarily a raid, although I'm guessing when it came out nobody was able to farm it with one group.</div></div><hr />

You compare your gear to that GoD magelo in order to argue that the AC differences are not that extreme.  You have 900AC on the GoD magelo.  This is pretty significant given the GoD magelo only has 1400AC to begin with.  <br />
<br />
Of course we shouldnt' have the same AC that you have.  Yet again, however, the power differential is staggering.  With that said, you recommend that we attempt events like Ikkinz1-3 without the benefit of the, say, 600 more AC that raiders in your guild likely had when they were dying to the trials (at least that is the case in my raiding guild).  And when your warriors were dying in those trials they had the advantage of being able to use Furious and Defensive, which is reportedly broken now in order to accomodate Knights (I presume). <br />
<br />
Does the path exist?  I don't know.  I haven't seen a non-raider complete Ikkinz1-3 yet.  Would love to hear from you if you have.   In the meantime, I'm not giving excuses for why its not possible, I'm stating facts for how its different.  I don't believe you know if its possible in reality or not, Frodlin, because when you were attempting this content you had near 2k AC.  With the necessity of AC in GoD, I cannot stress enough how important that difference is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok I haven't read the entire thread, or even most of it, but are you saying it is possible for a group of unguilded people without raiding....say 6 people who play together several hours every night and focus on progression, can get to Kod'Taz and succeed there with nothing but LDoN and lower GoD drops?  Has anyone actually done this without grouping with Time+ characters to get through the trials?  Has anyone ever seen an LDoN equipped warrior tank a Kod'Taz named, or complete and Ikkinz trial, grouped with other LDoN-equipped people, and win?  I'm not saying it's impossible, but I am skeptical.  Just tanking yard trash in tipt I don't feel safe in a group without 2 healers, so I find it hard to believe that a tank with 300 less ac and 1000 less hitpoints could make it through in a group of people with similar gear.  I'd like to see someone who has done it.  If it is reasonably doable I would think someone here would know somebody who has done it by now? (apologies if this has all been covered before, but I'm not reading 20 more pages of this crap at this point :)).<br />
<br />
The path may exist.  If it doesn't exist now, it almost certainly will with the release of OoW and raising the level cap.  The thing I don't understand though, is Battleblade and Apolyon acting like it would be some sort of disaster if people were allowed to get elemental level gear, say the level of gear that I have now, without raiding.<br />

EDIT:  OMG I Just looked at my magelo and realized that my int and wis are higher than my agility.  Now THERE's a problem with the game :).</div></div><hr />

Apoylons pretty close to me really.You are closer to me than BB.I could have a few more augs I guess If I didn't post here erm...Has it is It's tough enough for me to make all the raids and toss in some questing/xp time.I did hard ldons when I was 5k unbuff so the only problem there is social for you.Hard to fix really imo.Over 2k to BB and 400ac is fairly hefty,but, it doesn't matter to me at all cause I don't have to tank his stuff,or, measure up beside him.Apoylon can tank anything I can with a little more luck and healing.I don't see massive gaps that make stuff unplayable here.People seem to be progressing in an obvious manner to suit the content they are facing.<br />
<br />
I'm all for more content especially ornate plus stuff.However, BB's advantage over me means nothing in day to day play for me.I tank well for my friends and thats what matters.Because they do content with me they gear at the same pace.No one gets mad because I'm missing the 2k hp because well...why should I have it.I haven't slain those mobs yet.He's done more so he has more ..erm.<br />
<br />
Yeah,more good content is $$.Until then just kill stuff and make friends it's more fun than analyzing your deficiencys against tanks who have done so much more and fight far harder mobs.</div></div><hr />

In terms of hit points alone, the Gates armor &quot;set&quot; appears to be well positioned beyond LDON.<br />
<br />
In terms of AC, there is no question, the Gates gear is short on AC.  The set as a whole should provide 100 more AC than it does.  The Gates expansion appears designed to make warriors obtain AC through augments and non-visible slots.  But you could use those augments and non-visible gear with any of the other sets of armor too, so that's not an acceptable answer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Brutul the problem was never that this caliber of loot would be made available ... it's that loot quality must reflect difficulty of content or everything goes to pot.<br />
<br />
***Should a person be able to get EP raid quality gear killing mobs which hit for 300 (LDoN easies) no matter how long it takes them?<br />
***Should a person be able to level to 65 off moss snakes in EC no matter how long it takes them?<br />
<br />
The answer is a pretty clear ... no they should not.  Content must be balanced or everything is fucked up.  I would support EP quality LDoN gear only if the LDoN's required to get them were about as difficult as trials 5 and 6 in GoD.  This is the only thing I've ever really said .. content must be balanced.  Notice this is why i have no problems with EP gear dropping off 1groupable GoD runs ... because it's fucking hard no matter which way you look at it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u164"><b>korgo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p164">In terms of my gear being *crap.*  I make no bones about the fact that my gear could use upgrades.  I upgrade it when and where I can.<br />
<br />
In terms of me leaching off of my guild?  No.  That is certainly not the case.  I MT where I can, and am in the top 5 of my guild's warriors.  We are a casual raiding guild.  Thus breaking into time was a very big deal for us (almost a year later).<br />
<br />
Are there some in my guild who raid more?  Certainly.  They also have better equipment than I do.  In terms of my contributions.  I tank for Tipt groups and KT flag trials every morning without fail, and show up wherever my guild needs me in the evenings.   Folks know without fail when I will be on and that they can count upon my services to push them through events.<br />
<br />
AA wise.  I'm solid enough, and make no bones about it.  4 away from sturdiness5 and all the basics covered.  The rest is just candy that will make me tougher as i collect em down the road.<br />

And to speak of non-raiders having an option and being bereft of the option to advance.  I wholeheartedly disagree.  If you're game is diametrically opposed to joining with ANY raid and flagging at ANY time.  Then no, you can't be expected to advance and shouldn't complain when you don't.

What?  I've been a member of this board longer than you have. *laugh*  I've played Vigdis since December, 1999.  When I felt warriors were totally crapped-out, I put her away and played my chanter full time.  She has been on the shelf for 18 months and I started playing her again three weeks ago.  I never stated that I have problems getting Hard LDoN groups.  I said that the non-raiding friends that I group with for LDoNs have difficulty successfully completing them. <br />
<br />
I state again, this thread is about two things.  The creation of arbitrary barriers to content and the lack of an alternate progression path for hard core non-raiders.  All you keep preaching is the typical raider philosphy on progression blahblahblah.  In your view of the world there is exactly ONE way to progress and as a result you can hold yourself up to BB and note that you haven't done as much raid content as he has and therefore you aren't due the same raid gear that he has.  What you don't seem to understand is that people disagree with you on this point.  That's a pretty limited world view, an extremely narrow game model, and an undynamic view of a MMORPG.  Plod, plod, plod ahead. <br />
<br />
<br />
And to speak of non-raiders having an option and being bereft of the option to advance.  I wholeheartedly disagree.  If you're game is diametrically opposed to joining with ANY raid and flagging at ANY time.  Then no, you can't be expected to advance and shouldn't complain when you don't.

<br />

<br />
Read my stuff above.  It applies to the first part of your post.  Again, you have one world-view and it is both narrow and skewed.  If you cannot possibly imagine an alternative progression and advancement path then we have nothing to discuss with one another. <br />
<br />
VP is not opened up to casuals or hard core non-raiders.  VP requires a raid to take out a dragon that hits for 2k, has a 2k AE with dispell, AE Rampage.  Basically, a mini Fennin Ro.  So, no, this is opened up.  It's a cockblock without which non-raiders would have some fantastic quests available to them. <br />
<br />
GoD does not allow for EP-quality gear, much less Time-quality gear.  I've stated this several times in this thread but instead of restating it again I'm going to ask that you actually read posts when they are made and pertain to the points you wish to ignorantly make. <br />
<br />
And, finally, I'm tired of this bullshit about work. I just had to restate that point above.  Do you really need me to do it again or are you capable of reading?  Hard core non-raiders have the ability and desire to work hard for their upgrades.  Nevertheless, there IS a glass ceiling here and there are arbitrarily locked zones behind which we could prosper.</div></div><hr />

As I said earlier, mix and match, it's not sinful.   There's something that's rarely discussed in these threads when it comes to LDoN armors, and that's that they have multiple aug slots, so it's easy to play the wounded dog and compare base stats, but LDoN armor has WAY more room to grow than any other armor set.  A Royal Attandant BP cannot be viewed on the basis of it's preliminary stats alone, it must be viewed in light of what it can becom, and it can become quite powerful.<br />

Of course we shouldnt' have the same AC that you have. Yet again, however, the power differential is staggering.

The mobs were significantly harder than they are now, they weren't slowable, and they had MUCH higher atk.   Even with defensive, you needed basically 2 clerics to win, and remember, when we were doing them early on, we didnt' have the benefit of Holy Light, we did them with Supernal Light, which complicates matters even further.<br />

Again, if you don't wish to be called condescending I have to tell you that calling me a &quot;wounded dog&quot; is not really the way to go. <br />

Again, I tell you to look at my magelo and my dream magelo.  You don't have to tell me what I can get from LDoN BPs and I know how much room it has to grow.  Had you looked at the magelo as I asked you to before you blithely responded to my post by calling me a wounded dog you would have figured that out - and possibly it would have rendered such commentarily completely unnecessary. <br />
Insults aside, SoE thought for at least the time of the summit that the Royal Attendant had additional room to grow and Raaj used SoE's statements as examples of how casual and non-raiding players could further progress in the game with new armor sets.  So obviously someone has figured out that there is yet more room to grow here.<br />
<br />
None of these really addresses the core of this thread:  arbitrary blocking of zones.  One of the main reasons people ask for EP-equivalent armor is because we cannot access EPs.  In response I'm sure you or others will state that non-raiders could not hack EP content to gain that armor.  Well, then let the content decide!  We can certainly group there.  With a couple good groups of friends, and level 70 with OoW, I find it pretty plausible that we could also take down mobs like Froggy or the birds in Fire, the Crockedile in Earth, do the various ring events in Air...I think this is all doable by close-knit groups of non-raiders.  If it isn't, fine! Let us fail.  But at least give us the chance - and then I will shut my wounded dog yap about increasing LDoN armor efficiency. <br />
<br />
<br />
The mobs were significantly harder than they are now, they weren't slowable, and they had MUCH higher atk.

I know how hard the mobs were.  I was dying to them, and sometimes succeeding, on my enchanter.  What you are suggesting is with how Ikkinz has been subsequently gimped a warrior with 900less AC and 2500less HP will be able to tank the same named, slightly slowed, without the benefit of defensive.  I doubt this very much.  If Haass returns I guess we'll know one way or another. <br />

<br />
I'm confused.  I thought in order to GET Ikkinz2 or 3 you had to have completed Ikkinz1.  How can you say that a nonraider has completed 2 and 3, but not 1?  Do you mean to say that the nonraider was accompanied by raiding players that HAD completed Ikkinz1 but without that nonraiders help?  If so, then the example is rather without teeth.  I'm talking about whether an entire nonraid group has progressed through Ikkinz1-3.  Relying on raiding friends to get one through the content doesn't count in my book.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Gunnar, if you support this idea then in essence you support the hard core non-raider argument.   This thread was started because Grumbam was whining about non-raiders requesting equal access to zones.  His post also included a whine that we were asking for EP gear without the accompanying effort.  <br />
<br />
I suggest to you here today that if Sony opened up the Elemental Planes, content three expansions out of date, our gripes would cease.  If we really cannot handle the content with what we view to be elite skilled groups of players, so be it.  But I believe that we will successfully take down the mini-mini named, and we will be able to take down some mini-named.  It is of no small note that we will have access to some of the best experience zones in the game - especially important when we have to begin searching for blue or even con mobs to raise our level. <br />
<br />
The content very well may be down by raiding guilds.  But mostly the raiding guilds are starting to turn their eyes elsewhere.  If they had to actually compete for the mobs, I suspect they'd turn entirely to Time and GoD to progress - as they should anyway.  Alternatively, you could nstance encounters and base it on an expedition-type lock out as with GoD.  Either way works. The piont is that I believe there are several encounters far easier than Rallos Zek and numerous experience spots good for a single group.  Let us as it!  Make us complete a huge VT-style quest, but make it doable for alternative progression. <br />
<br />
BTW, I know the birds don't drop molds.  But they do drop cloaks and arms and maybe pants that are serious upgrades for casters.  Other similarly easy Fire minis do drop molds.  The Croc is in Earth and he also drops things that would be serious upgrades.  The mini-minis in Fire and Air also drop solid upgrades .  I don't believe non-raiding groups (2-3 groups) would be able to take down the gods or even the ring events, but that is no reason to bar us entirely from the easier content by requiring we beat a seriously difficult raid encounter in Tactics.</div></div><hr />

I hope you can see where I'm coming from. There's a tendancy for &quot;high&quot; level Warriors to take progression and our equipment pretty seriously. It's often that focus and determination that made us &quot;high&quot; level players and not casuals in the first place.<br />
<br />
BB<br />
<br />
There is of course diffrent ways of earning things.  While maybe a cop or fire fighter goes out and fights the most brutal battles every day are they the highest paid.<br />
<br />
What about the executive with his 3 hour martini lunch every day who makes 6 figures?<br />
<br />
I know you love the term brutal battles since you use it in most every post.  But believe me after doing over 700 Ldons and close to 100 hards that was pretty brutal.  Most were pu groups and some could barely win a normal LDON if I was not there to teach them how to do it.<br />
<br />
Now I raid 5 days a week and I have progressed from Old World Planes Kael, ToV, Ntov, SSRA, VT, PoP, Elementals, Time and now GoD.<br />
<br />
Yet I still wanted to progress my character enough to do 700 ldons.<br />
<br />
Now in most raids they are not that brutal.  There is very low risk.  The main risk is <br />
how long the CR will take.<br />
<br />
Its not like when we used to raid fear and had to get another guild to help us CR cause in 4 hours we still didnt have our corpses.<br />
<br />
Most raiders are barely awake its a time committment for most of them not a risk or effort.  <br />
<br />
Now even though I have raided a long time all my slots are not raid armor and a few are still LDON armor.<br />
<br />
Now why begrude people from having an alternate way to get quality armor that would help them progress?  Its still going to take a large committment of time to earn just like raiding.  The armor will still not be as good as your GoD armor but it will be an upgrade to close to a 2 year old expansion.  <br />
<br />
I raid 5 days a week but I don't begrudge others the right to earn too.<br />
<br />
I think there should be alternate progression path at least to sol ro for single groups.  They have quests all the way up to tactics and I did all of them before I was even flagged for those zones.<br />
<br />
If ldons are too easy make them harder or make it so you can only buy the better armor with ooints earned doing hards</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u177"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p177">The talk about GoD is nice, and it sounds good, but plain and simple most casuals won't be asked to tank for GoD groups. If you can't go, you can't loot.<br />
<br />
 Most casuals didn't buy GoD, at least not while I was online the first couple of months after it's release as far as I could tell. If you went to Natimbi and did a /who, you saw tags from all the EP/Time guilds, and then a couple of smaller raid guilds who hadn't entered EP only because of RZ. And, of course, the occasional unguilded sort.<br />
<br />
 I'd go with my guild, but my guild en masse refused to buy GoD, because it was perceived as being for the EP+ guilds. Even after all this time, I STILL think there's only two people in DA who did buy it.<br />
<br />
 I'd go pickup, but pickup groups don't want undergeared tanks when EP/Time tanks are a dime a dozen in GoD. So I've pretty much resigned myself to the fact that I've got to nearly double my HP and get another 300 AC before I can step in there and hope for a pickup slot.<br />

I'm not suggesting that there be no &quot;alternate&quot; route to progressing through zones.  Lord knows side quests would make life easier in terms of backflagging if you miss an event.<br />
<br />
Or even adding in Elemental quality LdoN gear (armor in particular).  I'm Game for that.  Lord knows i could use a set of legs and a new bracer.<br />
<br />
There are numerous non-visible slot upgrades through quests, etc, but very little in terms of Armor (High AC/HP)<br />
<br />
What I AM saying is that unless you revolve your game around NEVER joining a raid force (open or in guild), then advancement IS possible and easily feasable even with the smallest amount of play time.  It does however require work, and dedication.<br />
<br />
/joining the open raid channel or just showing up at BF raids and hoping for some pity flags. It's not perfect but it's what I've done.<br />
<br />
A full LDoN/GoD through Tipt geared tank who spent much time questing and T-skilling could easily break the 10k mark through the gear available and be a perfectly viable tank in tipt and a groupable tank in KT.<br />
<br />
Nothin outstanding in my gear and I have little fear tanking the heartstriker with or without a pet. (2 healer classes w/o a pet since defensive nerf).  So it is possible and my AC caps out at about 1750 w. full AC buffs including Niv's Harmonic.</div></div><hr />

Transcript from this evening. I'm lfg with a note that says GoD, Hard LDoN, Sol Ro.<br />
<br />
I get a tell from some untagged ranger lfg in barindu. <br />
him: hp/ac?<br />
me: 6k/1300<br />
him: no response<br />
<br />
No he doesn't bother to ask if thats buffed or unbuffed or if I've won hard ldons or sewers before. But you can bet he won't be with me next time I go :) The fact that finding a pickup group is hard in GoD (particularly for warriors IMO)  is a whole other can of worms, which doesn't really have any bearing on whether or not theres actually a progression available there.<br />
<br />
<br />
/joining the open raid channel or just showing up at BF raids and hoping for some pity flags. It's not perfect but it's what I've done.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah I've done it too, and it sucks hard. I'm about to be elemental flagged after several months of the bullshit, and now I've got to figure out a way to get the gear. It's not been challenging, fun, or generally worthwhile up to this point. It's just a matter of rolling the dice that the right group of 'raiders' (and I use the term loosely)  is around at the same time the mob is up and someone willing and able to lead is around. Most flag events I've done 4-5 times, after which time I refuse to go unless I lead. It's just not rewarding explaining max melee for the hundredth time, or arguing with people about whether or not they should use a ch rotation on rd.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah, my armor is very good compared to what a casual player can obtain, but I've &quot;earned&quot; it by fighting a lot of brutal battles, not by clicking a Purchase button at a Wayfarer Merchant. Besides, Casual Players, how many times have you been hit for 4000+ damage from a single reposte in a fight? If you aren't fighting the most brutal mobs you do not require the best or second best armor in the game.<br />
<br />
<br />
BB I seriously doubt any of us that are actually carrying on the argument with you are looking for easy ldons to yield EP level gear. I for one do not have the patience for that many ldons. Please drop it.<br />
<br />
That doesn't, however, mean that it wouldn't be appropriate to add something to the progression between ldon/ornate and elemental, or to make it possible to get to the elemental plains without going  through the open raid hell i'm almost done with. Like vigdis said, we're ALL ABOUT tanking the most brutal battles, but a lot of them just aren't viable without the proverbial 72 best friends helping you through a stack of flags.<br />
<br />
I certainly hope you aren't trying to argue that the Demonic Destroyer and Jhiru aren't the most brutal battles, and we don't need to be geared up to tackle them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u181"><b>Sythrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p181">Nevertheless, there IS a glass ceiling here and there are arbitrarily locked zones behind which we could prosper. <br />
<br />
I won't ever agree that the zones the way they are currently designed should ever be unlocked.  Perfect examples of this is certain areas where loot drops like candy, as a reward for progressing through content.  Qvic, Plane of Fire, and other end game zones reward the raiders for their hard work.  If anyone can step into these zones there would be absolutely no point to progression.<br />
<br />
As has been stated before, I think there should be alternate routes of progression, however in a completely different style.  If you want to be a non raider and  return to the 6 man groups, that's the way alternate progression should be designed.  They should have instanced or new dungeons, that get progressively harder and unlock new ones as you progress.  <br />
<br />
There's actually a ton of potential that just hasn't been touched with the ldon idea.  The current dungeons are just so lack luster and don't have any real originality to it, just a complete randomness that made the whole thing boring within a week.   What happened to all the tailor made dungeons?  When was the last time we had a GOOD dungeon? Velious?  Kunark? Three years ago?<br />
<br />
They could have dungeons with quests linked to them, opening up new content or additional rooms with new encounters.  They could have boss encounters after collecting items in the dungeons (this was done in Veksar, albeit the boss was a raid encounter).   There's just alot of different ideas you could use with 6 person groups that just have not even been considered or touched.<br />
<br />
Balancing these two types of styles, you would still have to have the raiders with the better quality loot drops, and in the end I think that's what alot of players pay attention to.  If better quality loot dropped off the 6 man group encounters, it would kill large scale raiding.  Some would say that's a good thing, but after near 4 years of dedicated raid content I don't see the game all of a sudden turning in a different direction.</div></div><hr />

Yes, of course, how silly of us.  Raiders aren't adequately rewarded by the gear they've acquired off the boss mobs of the planes, they need to have exclusive access to zones where loot drops like candy on a continual basis. /nod Oh yes, raiders have earned a continual pinata of loot just cascading at their feet.

<br />
Doing ldon 700 times over like I read in someone's previous post isn't risk vs. reward, it's doing mindlessly boring random made dungeons over and over again until you finally have the points you need for an item.  Casual players have never recieved hand made content specifically made for them.  You want content, you want to see content, that's great I think you should get it.  But ask for content that's tailored to your style of play.<br />
<br />
There's never been 6 man group progression content in this game, and there should have been years ago.  They wasted alot of energy with expansions like LoY that could have been better spent focusing on this.<br />
<br />
But to see zones that you worked long and hard for, spent time devising strategies, devoted even more time to backflagging, yet more time to gearing up your guild to get to these zones, and then have it unlocked to the masses is a slap in my face amigo.  It's like you spent 6 months to get into that hot chicks pants, only to see her banging some guy she met off the street the next day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u186"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p186">Doesn't really matter so long as I got inot her pants. lol<br />
<br />
I wasn't saying 700 LDoN was risk vs reward, I was saying that expecting rewards for single group encounters from raid progression is not risk vs reward. Your doing the same thing in a different locked zone that others do in unlocked zones. Same risk vs reward is the same, rewards should be the same.<br />
<br />
You implied that your raid progression allowing you to move into locked zones somehow afforded you better drops (reward) vs similar content (risk). That is the slap in the face. Thats not how it works. Also note that difficulty is relative, a group A fights Mob A that drops a Loot A. A beter geared group, group A+1 fights Mob A+1 that drops Loot A+1, not group A+1 fights Mob A+1 that drops 2 A+1, or A+2.<br />
<br />
Raiders have a certain level of gear that reflects the level of content that they are facing. Simliarly, a casual players gear reflect the content they are facing. The problem comes in when raiders bring that advantage to single group settings. I have no problem with raiders being better equiped for all lesser content, I do however have a problem when they recieve better rewards in comparison to the content they are facing.<br />
<br />
Is this an arguement for opening up EP zones to casuals so that they can challenge themself similarly, sure it can be, but thats not the point I'm trying to make. I think the problem is that SOE decided to place higher ZEM experience content in primarily raid zones that are locked behind raid flags. And then have the nerve to base AA point costs off of the experience gained in those zones. Zone which the vast majority of players will never see, nor can the zones support that majority. And then go and design a later expansion's single group content based of of gear obtained from at the very least a median level of raid gear.<br />
<br />
I have no problem with raider having a blast and pushing the envelope. However when that play style begins to significantly effect my play style, we have a problem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hey, you know what, I can relate.  And if SoE could pull it's head out and actually make 6 man progression content like you describe, then maybe unlocking old content wouldn't be necessary.  But let's be honest, do you see them doing this in OoW?  I'm dubious.  So, people are supposed to cross their fingers and hope like hell SoE gets it right in the expansion after OoW, the one that is at least a year away?  Yeah, sounds promising.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u188"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p188">Actually there has always been a single group progression path. In the original release it got you Crafted, but not Indicolite. Later it got you Thurgadin Quest or PoG (but the BP took more than a group), or Cobalt (but not the BP or Legs), but not ToV, Skyshrine or an Epic.<br />
<br />
Now it gets you LDoN and some Kizrak (not the BP or afaik, the legs), but not Warlord's or Vadd's.<br />
<br />
I can see a non-progression quest to get a ToSoRo key, but not an EP key. Give non-raiders access to Kizrak, not Warlord.<br />
<br />
That's how thae game's always been - Crafted and a SSoY with a group, Indicolite and later an Epic by raiding.<br />

<br />
 In my case, it's entirely valid. No groups = no loot, period. I could always grind out my VT shards, too, but without a raid force, I won't be seeing VT loot either.<br />
<br />
 But ya know what? VT I understand; that's a raid zone. GoD first half is, by all descriptions, a bunch of XP zones and a few single group trials to get to the raid stuffs. Somewhere along the way, a good XP tank went from being around 4k+ in Tier 2 PoP to around 6k in hard LDoN's to GoD, where 6k won't even get you a reply. 4k was pretty doable in early PoP. 6k was hard but reasonable in LDoN. 7k+ in GoD is, while not impossible, pretty damn improbable for the casual player. And I see no signs of the trend discontinuing anytime soon - if anything, I'm betting the only tanks people will be looking for at all in OoW will be 8k+. And, of course, no one has YET figured out a way to get 8k unbuffed from casual progression.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u190"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p190">I don't even thing, from the decription of the EPs that they can even support mass experience groups while not getting in the way of raids. That is the single reason I have for not opening up the EPs, but like I've said before, I haven't been there. I'm just going off what I've read from somewhat reasonable posts made by others here at TSW.<br />
<br />
Baseing AA point costs off of those zones is IMO unacceptable. Unfortunately, I don't don't think anything can be done about it.<br />
<br />
Baseing GoD single group progression off of an assumed EP gear level, whether from EP or near EP fully augged LDoN armor sets, is just plain bad design. I'm going to make a couple of assumptions, take them with a grain of salt if you wish. When GoD single group progression was designed, it appears to have assumed the casual player to have farmed LDoN out and obtained a full suit of the highest tier of augged LDoN, or equivalent, gear. They seem to have forgotten to factor in the time it takes to obtain that set of gear. I think it safe to say that obtaining a full suit with even the most hardcore players, that actually would be benefited by the gear, was unrealistic due to the armor costs/point rewards currently implemented.<br />
<br />
In short, I think they goofed, just like the level 70 thingy. this is something that I think should be corrected.</div></div><hr />

So the risk is that you will waste your night?  Thats the risk vs reward.  Seems to me its a time committment.<br />
<br />
Nothing to do with risk vs reward anymore.  If anything the single group god stuff is more risk then most raids.<br />

Btw I am the opposite of a casual player.  I raid 5 nights a week and I have for years.</div></div><hr />

SoE is all about least effort invested for maximum dollar return.  They really could give a damn if EQ was all raid all the time if that wasn't a money maker for them,  Right now they think it is.  And partly they're under the delusion that the non-raider is meekly happy with the status quo.  When they wake up to the cold cruel reality that raiding isn't what keeps the majority of people playing this game and realize that they're losing dollars like nobody's business, you'll see them scrambling to make some changes, oh yes you will.  And it won't matter a tinkers damn what they may have said in the past.  They've shown us more than once that words from SoE are just that, words.  They have no particular meaning and you really can't expect to be able to hold SoE to them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u200"><b>Groovdog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p200">Brutul the problem was never that this caliber of loot would be made available ... it's that loot quality must reflect difficulty of content or everything goes to pot.<br />
<br />
***Should a person be able to get EP raid quality gear killing mobs which hit for 300 (LDoN easies) no matter how long it takes them?<br />
***Should a person be able to level to 65 off moss snakes in EC no matter how long it takes them?<br />
<br />
The answer is a pretty clear ... no they should not.  Content must be balanced or everything is fucked up.  I would support EP quality LDoN gear only if the LDoN's required to get them were about as difficult as trials 5 and 6 in GoD.  This is the only thing I've ever really said .. content must be balanced.  Notice this is why i have no problems with EP gear dropping off 1groupable GoD runs ... because it's fucking hard no matter which way you look at it.<br />
<br />
The infamous risk vs reward, no offense but there is no risk in this game for anything GoD- due to graveyards and the trivialization of content. IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN TIME VS REWARD. The only risk inherant in the vast majority of this game since likely Kunark/Velious (and definitely in the PoP world) is the loss of alot of time associated with a CR. GoD has modified it somewhat without GYs but the backup graveyard (cant remember name now) still makes sure you can NEVER lose your equipment unless you choose to. You may not be able to play for a week if you cant get someone (or a guild) to help you get your corpse but that is it.<br />
<br />
There is a hell of a lot risk in a guild farming an encounter that is has successfully completed than a pickup (or non semi-permenant) EP- grp doing a hard LDoN. The first couple tries till you succeed are risky (risk losing time) but after that its the occasional wipe.<br />
<br />
In the end this game is all about time and quit using the &quot;uber&quot; argument that their stuff is risky (it is definitely harder but that translates directly into time spent), its not. More challenging, yes, risky (i.e. time consuming) not necessarily. Especially when you factor in the non-hardcore access to xp is so much worse that they waste more time on AAs than a fire capable character does.<br />
<br />
Oh and BB I love your quote about a raid going for one piece of loot that might rot. I guarantee you the vast majority of those people raiding are not getting that kind of return. If you are seeing 50% rot than you are likely doing trivial content on your way to better content or you should be bitching to SoE about drop rates. And your risk of the guild imploding is the same risk of my grp or casual guild imploding thereby limiting my non-hardcore progression. Your argument is one of broken content (and I wont disagree that likely ours is too) not of risk vs reward.<br />

Now it might seem to bolster your argument that's it's Time Spent, but you are really making any point you might have seem idiotic.<br />
<br />
Players aren't equally skilled. They aren't equally intellegent even at maximizing the reward for time spent. Harder boss mobs drop better stuff. Minor errors in a raid can kill 50-72 people. A minority of players that effectively make the effort are equipped better than others. I know quite a few players that are guildless or in lower level guilds not because of Time Spent, but because of how they play which is a direct result of what they have done.

I think LDoN is hella cheap. I'm not above getting the 0 risk augs and pumping up my Adventurer's Stone. But in all honesty, if you could get a DBoW there, I'd question why I even bother to play the game.<br />
<br />
Afaic level 65 WARRIORS fight brutal battles against the most fearsome mobs in the game they can manage to find. While I might admire the patience of a player in LDoN armor, I'm not impressed with their Warriorly appoach to getting the tools of the trade. I have exactly the same attitude towards the Bazaar Warrior that makes a couple million pp and twinks a Warrior with twin SoD's and full Kizrak.<br />
<br />
Yeah, my armor is very good compared to what a casual player can obtain, but I've &quot;earned&quot; it by fighting a lot of brutal battles, not by clicking a Purchase button at a Wayfarer Merchant. Besides, Casual Players, how many times have you been hit for 4000+ damage from a single reposte in a fight? If you aren't fighting the most brutal mobs you do not require the best or second best armor in the game.<br />
<br />
I hope you can see where I'm coming from. There's a tendancy for &quot;high&quot; level Warriors to take progression and our equipment pretty seriously. It's often that focus and determination that made us &quot;high&quot; level players and not casuals in the first place.<br />
<br />
BB<br />
I dont disagree with any of this except the last sentence where you imply focus and determination = hard core raider. That is simply not the case and is the CRUX of this entire theme.<br />
<br />
I respect your achievements and always feel that you should be a serious cut above any non-raider, that being said I am not sure the gap should be as large as it is especially if SOE doesnt develop any level 65 content that is harder than PoV but easier than the worthwhile GoD stuff (defined to me as the trials and KT mostly). The time vs reward in GoD outside of those is not comparable to LDoN/PoV for equipment/xp. My time in Barindu/Ferubi etc has shown me that they suck as xp zones compared to PoV (PEM probably the real difference but the higher hp and bigger hitters makes a difference too, that and mitigating slow).<br />
<br />
You do miss one the points, namely that casuals dont get riposted for 4k because they cant. They cant get the armor (they dont raid) so they dont even try. A better question would be how many casuals have failed the GoD trials miserable as MT (no pooka) because they have a very hard time gearing up.<br />

I get a tell from some untagged ranger lfg in barindu. <br />
him: hp/ac?<br />
me: 6k/1300<br />
him: no response<br />
<br />
No he doesn't bother to ask if thats buffed or unbuffed or if I've won hard ldons or sewers before. But you can bet he won't be with me next time I go :) The fact that finding a pickup group is hard in GoD (particularly for warriors IMO)  is a whole other can of worms, which doesn't really have any bearing on whether or not theres actually a progression available there.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah I've done it too, and it sucks hard. I'm about to be elemental flagged after several months of the bullshit, and now I've got to figure out a way to get the gear. It's not been challenging, fun, or generally worthwhile up to this point. It's just a matter of rolling the dice that the right group of 'raiders' (and I use the term loosely)  is around at the same time the mob is up and someone willing and able to lead is around. Most flag events I've done 4-5 times, after which time I refuse to go unless I lead. It's just not rewarding explaining max melee for the hundredth time, or arguing with people about whether or not they should use a ch rotation on rd.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
BB I seriously doubt any of us that are actually carrying on the argument with you are looking for easy ldons to yield EP level gear. I for one do not have the patience for that many ldons. Please drop it.<br />
<br />
That doesn't, however, mean that it wouldn't be appropriate to add something to the progression between ldon/ornate and elemental, or to make it possible to get to the elemental plains without going  through the open raid hell i'm almost done with. Like vigdis said, we're ALL ABOUT tanking the most brutal battles, but a lot of them just aren't viable without the proverbial 72 best friends helping you through a stack of flags.<br />
<br />
I certainly hope you aren't trying to argue that the Demonic Destroyer and Jhiru aren't the most brutal battles, and we don't need to be geared up to tackle them.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This really gets my goat.<br />
<br />
Lets take a closer look at what you said:<br />
<br />
this evening. I'm lfg with a note that says GoD, Hard LDoN, Sol Ro.<br />
<br />
So instead of building a cohesive group of other casual/nonraid friends who have the same playtimes and goals as you to group with when you log in every night,  you're putting on /LFG and hoping that you'll get to where you want to go based on the willingness of total strangers?? <br />
<br />
This is a losing strategy.<br />
<br />
I get a tell from some untagged ranger lfg in barindu.<br />
<br />
This ranger was rude ... but look, he has no credentials ( guild affiliation ) and is also is trying to get where he wants to go with /LFG.<br />
<br />
These are the kind of people you're likely to encounter with a strategy of relying on strangers to group.<br />
<br />
It's just a matter of rolling the dice that the right group of 'raiders' (and I use the term loosely)  is around at the same time the mob is up and someone willing and able to lead is around. Most flag events I've done 4-5 times, after which time I refuse to go unless I lead. It's just not rewarding explaining max melee for the hundredth time, or arguing with people about whether or not they should use a ch rotation on rd.<br />
<br />
Ahh ... the problem comes into focus.<br />
<br />
If you play with the same small ( or large ) group of folks every night when you log in these problems go away. If you relay on total strangers to find you and want to help you get loot...  you're dreaming kiddo.<br />
<br />
If Haas, with his abrupt, confrontational mannerisms, and his poor language can have a dedicated group of players to fight with , there is no reason you can't.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Players aren't equally skilled. They aren't equally intellegent even at maximizing the reward for time spent. Harder boss mobs drop better stuff. Minor errors in a raid can kill 50-72 people.

<br />
BB<br />
<br />
As long as a person isnt stupid (i.e. walk into aggro range by accident and wipe the raid) and isnt so on a consistent basis then this argument has no value. And I AM SURE you boot those that dont fit the above. One mistake in a trial group and the grp wipes too (death by pooka for example). Hell one bad mistake in a hard-ldon with a less than attentive evacuer and the grp can wipe thereby putting the only real reward (AP) at risk (talking non uber here, ubers means 45 mins instead of 35. And as far as pookas and paths of least resistance I agree but that means you need a very good chanter and some means of controlling it (pally stun, etc.) to make sure its doable. I would ask how many EP- chanters can effectively handle a pooka for extended periods and would answer that the number is small. My chanter is EP flagged and decently equipped and the pookas make me nervous although I do use them and hasted hard LDoN charmed pets as well.<br />
<br />
And BB you are arguing with a lot of people who raid (either did or do) and who see both sides. Many of us cant anymore and didnt really appreciate the gap until we didnt and also its gotten worse.<br />
<br />
I love how it all comes back to skill, I guarantee some of the best players in this game are non-raiders, they HAVE to do more with less whereas I have fed off the gravy train as warrior #5 and know that regardless of my skill that the raid (so long as no one did anything REALLY stupid) could survive the occasional mistake made by myself or warrior #4 or #7. Now if #1 or #2 screwed up then we bit the dust but that is where skill really matters.<br />
<br />
I begrudge no MT/MA/puller/cleric/raid leaders (try managing a relic raid of over 250 people on 10 locations simultaneously - DAOC - I know what its like to coordinate and its why respect the hell out of good guild leadership) their gear (and situationally others as well) as there is no doubt that they earned it. The other 52 people in the raid however have different levels of skill as I have so recently learned when getting through the trials with my warrior. Its impossible to 6box (well for me at least) these so I went in 2 boxed and was suprised by the skill level of some of the harder core raiders on my server. Some amazing, some far less so. I, unlike so many of the people we are talking about, had no problem getting into grps  with 8k unbuffed and a DBotW. For most its not so easy.<br />

Several times I've provided a link that shows the total AC and HP's from complete armor sets. It does not show what can be achieved by a non-raiding hardcore player by mixing and matching. But it's better than doing LDoN alone.<br />
<br />
Look at the Top 500 Magelo's for Warriors on EQRankings. Heck, look at mine. Raex armor surely is pretty cutting edge indeed. 75% of what you would call &quot;uber&quot; Warriors wear some of it.<br />
<br />
Not cutting edge? At my progression level a Raex's Chestplate of Destruction is the best obtainable BP in the game - it drops from Quarm for goodness sake lol. How many Warriors on your server have one? What percent?<br />
<br />
Gerick,<br />
You don't &quot;get past&quot; those see invis guards, you kill them. You slow the mobs with a ToD and kill them with a Sword of Ssra (or a Black Acrylia 2Hdr) with a lifetap aug to minimize your need to heal.<br />
<br />
BB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u217"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p217">Battleblade, I always respect your opinion. And, I think raiders always have to see the best gear first. I think that's obvious. Since the day Vox first dropped haste, it's always been that way.<br />
<br />
But the assumption that casual players want 100-day grinds through easy LDoNs as a character advancement path merely so that they can avoid risk is just not the case.  I actually prefer to hunt riskier mobs. They're out there, but they don't drop as nice a gear (for the most part) as LDoN points will eventually get you. That's why the adventure camps have a bunch of characters with LFG over their heads but there aren't too many people getting groups together to quest Thurg armor in their late 40s. Yet it's a hoot to take a group of level 50 players over the see invis line in Kael. Well, up until high level farmers train you.<br />
<br />
Just as hardcore raiders have always had the best gear, it's also the case that eventually non-raiders (or very casual guilds who might &quot;raid&quot; with three groups) also have a chance at what was once raider-only level gear. The question is not does this happen, but when? <br />
<br />
The issue with some of the zones that casual players are talking about is that they are always going to be locked. SONY obviously wants to make even second- or third-best gear tough to get, as well they should. But particularly with PoP zones, some levels of this gear was designed to be risky for 72-man raids. It's going to take a lot of mudflation before two or three group raids can deal with that.<br />
<br />
hence the easy LDoN path for gear upgrades: oh, you might die to a perfect storm of &quot;D'oh!&quot; moments or bad LD timing, but it's pretty low risk; also the adventure merchant stuff is not a rare drop: if you have the points, the drop is 100%. The trade off is that it's a long, long grind. There's a sort of stealth tradeoff too: getting used to no risk hardly makes people better players. <br />
<br />
And don't say &quot;do hards.&quot; that's not always possible, given that a warrior needs a group and the group will want a warrior that's already well geared for a hard.<br />
<br />
Here's your own assessment of the highest risk raiders face:<br />
&quot;There's even a greater risk - faced with multiple failures guildmembers either don't log in or retire, threatening the continued existance of the guild and the potential loss of 4 years of hardcore raiding by other members that retire in the aftermath.&quot;<br />
<br />
I'm not sure you realize the implications of what you are saying here: that the worst thing that can happen to you is that you essentially become one of the best equipt casual warriors in the game.<br />
<br />
You're saying that casual players should be happy spending 150 days getting to a place that you would consider the worse thing that could happen to you?<br />
<br />
The good news for you if this happens is that apparently you would have a perfectly satisfying character improvement path.<br />
<br />
You have become better at rhetoric (201)!<br />

Worst equipped, best equipped casual player what does it matter? I've been unguilded for as long as 4 months. It sucked for me. I'm a hardcore raider. Yes, during downtime (that unfortunate period of time between raids) I get for now needed LDoN augs or get experiance, but I'm just as likely to solo for no real purpose whatsoever. Not raiding is not playing EQ. It's playing Doom or something.<br />
<br />
Oh, I've had fun in groups, don't get me wrong. But the number of groups wanting to knock off a Fabled mob (no longer exist), Trak, KT, AoW, a dragon, clear ST or VP (ruined now I expect) are minimal.<br />
<br />
Grind extra LDoN AP point for possible use in OoW? Are you nuts? I'll beg a spot in a public raid H2Hding an EP flag mob first.<br />
<br />
No thanks, unguilded doing group stuff in a Masively Multiplayer game with MAJOR raid targets up? I'd rather pull nails with my eyelids.<br />
<br />
Y'all are the one's that choose to deny yourselves, not me. Pickup raids and guild alliance raids aren't all that difficult to organize.<br />
<br />
Group only players are no more &quot;entitled&quot; to a progression path that results in raid quality gear than someone who solos. Where the soloer's progression path at 65?<br />

Verant/SoE calls it risk or challange and always has. Fine, be &quot;the voice of reason&quot;, but Quarm loot should not drop from Moss Snakes or the turn in of 3000 Moss Snake Fangs. There are such quests, but not a lot and they certainly aren't the game's central theme.<br />
<br />
There is a progression and more difficult boss mobs drop better loot. Boss mobs that require more players to kill them drop better loot. That's the way the game is designed. That's the way FFXI is and WoW, and D&amp;D and I rather expect most successful RPG's.<br />

You're such a fool.  It's no more challenging for you to do what you do than it is for me to kill a moss snake.  You turn on auto attack and press your buttons like the trained monkey you are, and at the end of the day, we've both done the same shit, with different rewards based upon how many people you run with.

I didn't suggest that raiders are talentless thugs.  All I said was that raiding, for those not leading the raid, is no harder than exp grouping.  Being a kickass raider is nothing more than paying attention and pushing a few buttons at the appropriate time, just like exp grouping.  People who suck on raids, suck in exp groups too, and for the same reason.  They don't pay attention and haven't gone to the effort to learn how to play their class to it's full potential.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And how many expansions was that ago? And how many zones in that expansion required guild level raids to enter? And it cockblocked a true raid-only zone (one of the true few ones in the game although I supppose you could one grp pieces now but why) vs xpable content. Also VT represents the APEX of the equipoment in its time so I have no problem with being blocked out of it (until such time as the raiders have moved on an expansion or two).<br />
<br />
But wait if we opened up VT more than people would rip through it and then go to EP/Time and then competition for the content at the high end would increase, cant have that. Nowadays guilds that are starting in VT (or lower) rarely make it to Time and if they do many are burned out. We had a guild go from VT to EP in like 10 days recently. They disbanded shortly after (still havent heard why). We havent had a new Time guild in a long time and very few new EP guilds (but that is just my server so who knows). Its far easier for people who aspire to Time to backflag into a Time+ guild than to ride the whole progression path so this is becoming symptamtic.<br />
<br />
In short, one example doesnt work, try again. In those years Sony has shifted from using time as cockblock (which frankly I am more ok with) to using raids as a cockblock on content (which I am not ok with).<br />

Not in terms of the gear where it has always been large (compare your epic to a palladius axe and even epics were real raids in that era).<br />

But having the next expansion not-tiered. If they would only make it a 'real' place with make-sense geography and raiding content in amongst that.<br />

I agree with Groovdog... the VT/VP style key quests were much better idea than the flagging that came in with PoP.<br />

Turning raiding into a pecking order of tiers (like PoP/GoD) and then giving non-raiders their own rat-race in LDoN is just bound to create the kind of unhappiness we see in this thread.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm 37 and about average age in my guild.The friends I have often grouped with for 5-10 hour xp sessions from LDON to EP to GOD normally find it relaxing and fun.They are seldom fatigued over much by playing in groups no matter how much we die.These same folks(most a bit older) usually need a break after even a 3 hour raid because it takes far more out of them than grouping.Generally,their effort,concentration and stress levels are much higher during raiding.LDON is one of the easiest,most relaxing types of grouping we do.We've had several players app who primarily leveled in LDON and had the themes down to a science.Very predictable stuff.However, they couldn't adjust well to raiding...to ummm think outa the box.<br />
<br />
Guilds progressing through content face all sorts of challenges that most members who carry their own weight share to a degree.It forces raiders to adjust to new challenges in a faster paced more intense environment.Often things are not as one dimensional as in a group and more situational awareness and flexibilty is required.<br />
<br />
In it's simplest form a group is fighting a single mob.It arrives at the group the warrior tanks mob gets debuffed and the single cleric heals the tank.Other people dps.There are no real choices to be made and few adjustments to worry about through the fight.During raiding things are often in flux ,requiring everyone to adapt to changing circumstance.Healing is more complex,cc is much busier dangerous adds need fast ,efficient off tanking named mobs have more added abilities etc etc.All this has to happen roughly in sync with 50-72 people and often many mobs.The leader can't cover every single move of every person in the fight, so inititive and decision making is important to many individuals.Overall,the ability to progressively raid well requires more skill and effort than grouping.<br />
<br />
This does not mean that I think I am &quot;leet&quot; to any degree.My wife and I are relative newbs to eq and the internet in general.I have met some very highly skilled players with my guild who can do things beyond the average players capability.I'm not one of those folks.With the experience I've been lucky enough to add with the last year of raiding with great people I feel I'm a solid tank for my content level and that's about it.I'm sure Haas and his friends have all the game skill I do and probably more.However,I don't believe they expend the same effort &amp; energy or are challenged similiarly by group content as I am by raiding.Personally,I think the experiences are light years apart.<br />
<br />
Everyone that I know who finds it easy to overcome the latest groupable content and quests given the right gear is obviously far more stressed/challenged by our raiding.Sure Tipt is stressful in a way,but,there's only so much you can do and letting your group down is not equal to letting your raid down.How about chasing those bloody trash reds through the midst of your raid in pow omg.Or the bloody spider ring in poa,or clearing earth rings at 90+ kphwith unmezzables and blur mobs lumbering through the raid.It's just not the same for me or the people I know.<br />
<br />
Being a raider doesn't make you a better than anyone else it just works you harder more consistently imo.Guilds have to pick themselves up and surmount challenges in ways groups just don't face.Heck..they crack under the strain all the time.<br />
<br />
I am for more paths of progression for non raiders.This is an adventure game that pits players against content tho.If I help kill gods of immense power the rewards should be far greater than anyone see's from killing weak repetitive trash in LDON.If not whats the point?Might as well scrap all the raid content and we can all pound on those moss snakes by ourselves.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The sad thing is alot of non-raiders want to feel that way but cant because much of the content that would really challenge them is flagged behind somewhere they cant get to, geared past them, or takes 3+ grps which is not always doable. Those of us who are arguing (I hope at least) on many of these issues want it to be that way and wouldnt support better LDoN equipment for those people crazy enough to do 40 easy LDoNs. Maybe if they capped the theme, maybe, but I would look for a requirement of hard LDoNs as well or maybe a minimum completion time to qualify (demonstrating skill and maybe a little luck). Who knows just thoughts on how to implement the &quot;difficult/challenging&quot; piece once its agreed that its a need that is out there.<br />
<br />
In the end I can beat my head against content with the best of them (I lost 10 straight 1hr30 hard LDoNs before I could work though the details of how to 6box them successfully without a real puller to ensure single/doubles), the difference is that a raid is likely to be able to adapt/learn more from others that can help whereas I and my grp can only do so much alone if I am not close to geared for it, especially if we are not a routine grp (vs a pickup grp).<br />
<br />
Oh and BB havent seen anyone argue against VT shards, other than that it is stupid to make it something so trivial. Make me farm 10 parts from something that is semi-challenging and can give decent xp/loot and I wont bitch, I will just execute. Oh and make the zone something I can use in 1 grp too. Maybe 2.

<br />
Coming from a non-raider, something like that would be easy to implement, and attainable, while keeping the raider-beloved EP planes locked. <br />
<br />
Or create a new set of armor molds that drop from these new Vxed type trials that are below elemental armor in quality (in the way i described above).  These one group trials are perfect for people like me who have pretty much maxxed ldon except for a few random augments and have moved on to GoD.  The current drops in GoD are too close to LDoN armors to provide a difference in tanking in upper tier zones.  <br />
<br />
If an 8k elemental tank is getting his ass handed to him in Tipt, with his group of elementally focused/ac/hped/mana-ed group, please explain how an LDoN tank with an LDoN group will be able to do it.  The only answer I can see is, &quot;You aren't supposed to be in Tipt&quot;.  Well if I'm at the end of LDoN progression, and I can't do Tipt/KodTaz, then what should I do?  Hey WoW, here I come.<br />
<br />
Doing this will close the gap between non-raiders and the elemental crowd, and allow a bit more equality when these two types of groups attempt to do Tipt and beyond.<br />
<br />
Either that or create some some new armor in LDoN that you can only buy if you do Hard LDoNs.  But that prospect, personally, is not too appealling since after so many LDoNs I've already done, grinding out another 200-400 leaves a bad taste in my mouth.</div></div><hr />

In normal ldon you get 52 points for a win<br />
an Ldon normal mob has 9000hp <br />
you kill 45 per win on average<br />
total hp killed is 46.7million<br />
A moss snake has 40 hp<br />
each takes 30 seconds to find and kill<br />
you need the same amount of hp killed to get the piece (46.7m)<br />
=&gt; you need to kill 1.2m moss snakes <br />
1.2m snakes would take you 406 days played =)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u250"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p250">I am all for a set of &quot;close to EP&quot; armor obtainable by groups as xwraithx describes - about 110-130hp 50AC on most slots.  However, I suspect that the people asking for it would not be happy with the difficulty involved in getting it.<br />
<br />
Sony's recent content additions illustrate two avenues to obtaining this quality of gear: <br />
<br />
1) Tipt-style trials, designed to always have a significant chance of failure, with Jhiru-type mobs giving guaranteed drops of such gear.  (If Jhiru = bracer, imagine what kind of mob would drop a breastplate...)<br />
<br />
2) Time-intensive quests with rare mobs and long spawns, as per the new VP quests.  (Raising multiple factions, competing with farmers for Zlandicar, farming ultra-rare tradeskill components...)<br />
<br />
To me, both of these are more difficult than grinding 20 hard LDONs per piece of armor, and I would be surprised if most non-raiders end up preferring them to the LDON model.</div></div><hr />
