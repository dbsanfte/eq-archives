<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">05-12-2003, 03:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Woot we had our first kill of vindi yesterday. Failed on first attempt with 18 people got about 7 more and killed him on the second try.<br />
<br />
I do have a couple of questions though. I was the secondary assist because i have AE taunt in case we needed to do a tank switch and i tagged vindi on the incoming. I then found that i was taking quite a bit of rampage damage on the first fight. On the second fight we assiged a cleric to me but something went wrong and i dropped, so the MA had to fight through after defensive wore off.<br />
<br />
Im curious though - how many other people does vindi rampage or is it just the one. Also, should perhaps someone else be made the rampage tank if we are intending to do a tank swop because we dont have the numbers/dps to do it under 3 mins.<br />
<br />
Also, on the first fight we were very lucky and were able to split his guadsman and so we had vindi singled. However on the second fight we couldnt so pulled him and the guardsmand and had someone OT on the guardsmand and this caused a few more deaths. Are there any tips/tricks to getting consistent single pulls on vindi?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arantius</div><div class="date">05-12-2003, 04:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lots of good information on pulling Vindi in the monly business forums.  As for rampage, that's one of the things I'm yet to solidly know.  I'm rather certain that an NPC keeps a separate rampage list, and will always hit the first person on that list that is still alive and is in melee range.  I've heard that list is established only by order you are added, and does not change based on amounts of aggro, but I am not sure about that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would suggest someone not on the tank rotation be the rampage tank.</div></div><hr />
