<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nayl</div><div class="date">11-12-2003, 04:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So we go to Tactics tonight to do a little backflagging and hopefully drop a BoW.  As has been usual the last few runs at this event, Vallon Zek spawns with no adds.  Also, I believe he used to split at 50%, tonight he did it at 40%.  Then the fake RZ despawns at 60%, not 50%, we punt out with only one death.<br />
<br />
But the real cherry on the watered down cake:<br />
<br />
We move down to the arena to do RZTW.  As we are setting up, one of our late arrivals forgets his brain at the door, and aggros RZTW on the raid.  MT spots his Badness inc, and runs over to engage.  I take one look at the position (basically right in the middle of the casters and healers) and figure we are screwed.  But then...<br />
<br />
No AE ramp.  None.  Nada, zip, zero, bubkus.  We successfully manuever RZ into the corner, never lose the MT, and beat him down in about the usual time.  Only difference in the end is that our kiters get mulched and we have to do the old punt out and train the mobs out of the way routine.<br />
<br />
I've seen lots of threads speculating about RZ being gimped, less HP, etc.. But this - unless this was a bugged event, this is opening the door to the elementals big time.  Consistent with SoE practice I suppose, but can't say I like it.<br />
<br />
Ah well, I suppose its better than them just opening them to anyone who can reach level 65...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Madronedorf</div><div class="date">11-12-2003, 05:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">RZ seems really random now sometimes itsl ike omg anyone can do it, and sometimes tons of adds spawn making it really hard (espically on fake warlord part)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ODB</div><div class="date">11-12-2003, 07:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The script is seriously fugged up. A few nights ago anothr guild on Inny went for him and some other other guild decided to train RZtW on the other guild's clerics. They wiped =/ but the thing is, isn't there a non interference code now to prevent that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grobble</div><div class="date">11-12-2003, 07:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Must have been a buggy script... we tried him sunday and none of that was true.</div></div><hr />

The script is seriously fugged up. A few nights ago anothr guild on Inny went for him and some other other guild decided to train RZtW on the other guild's clerics. They wiped =/ but the thing is, isn't there a non interference code now to prevent that?  <br />
<br />
The 'one raid agro' feature worked fine for us a week or two ago when a couple of guilds on our server thought they'd be cute and try to snag RZtW after we spawned him. A member of our raid got first agro and their people mostly got ejected from the zone or killed.<br />
<br />
He's still a stingy bastard on BoWS too :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tricsun-Drinal</div><div class="date">11-12-2003, 01:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">just a question, do the adds still run at bard speed or were they slowed down?  Tried him first time last night and got to 22% before adds killed us so was just wondering.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Snowz</div><div class="date">11-12-2003, 01:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This has been that way for quite some time. Ever since the zone wide lag started the script has been whacked out. Rallos Zek and the Warlord not ramping or maybe ramping once a fight is common now, which is sad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Danadur</div><div class="date">11-12-2003, 05:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">we do him a lot now...doesnt seem too bugged. i mean adds are spawning and stuff he AEs for sure and Rampages also...adds are still gimp tho cuz u can kite them so easy. but anyways one time we did him he rampaged once, no aes , 5 adds...thats it...but a 15min fight becuz of the fucking zone lag =p<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dagginb</div><div class="date">11-13-2003, 11:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We had a guide watching us for one attempt, because we had a questionable person in the zone that has a bad history with us.  Anyway, while we're getting set up in the pit, the guide is moving around, then all of a sudden, the guide drops dead, and RZ rushes us.  Heh, we managed to get RZ under control and pushed him all over our clerics before he went in corner, and killed him.  Was kind of funny listening to the guide say that he did'nt get aggro, that the AoE killed him, but he died in 2 seconds after RZ rushed him....<br />
<br />
RZ does seem pretty weak now, rampages 1-3 a fight is norm, and only getting anywhere from 6 to 18 adds per fight instead of around 30 makes a huge difference too.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arathena</div><div class="date">11-13-2003, 01:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They do. A guide's Avatar has no particular abilities above and beyond yours. Further, where you're wearing your Gauntlets of Dragon Slaying or whatever, they've got 12 AC gaunts with 'Effect: Customer Service Ressurection'.. No excuse though, they have instaclicky CS Invuln. =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ODB</div><div class="date">11-13-2003, 01:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">omg11!!! maeby he was eBay~z</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dagginb</div><div class="date">11-13-2003, 02:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">He swore that there was no way he could have gotten aggro and trained us either.  Is a guide non-kos to all at all times?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gallerus</div><div class="date">11-13-2003, 03:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think guides have the ability to make themselves &quot;invisible&quot; to mobs so they wont get agro (might also clear them off agro lists too, I dunno)...but its sorta like pet casters with that pet hold aa - if you dont turn it on it dont do too much good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mystaviant</div><div class="date">11-14-2003, 03:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had the privilage of becoming a gm for about 7 hours approx a year ago.  Just logged in, named was green, and said &quot;GM&quot; when you did a /who on me.  Every mob I could find was indifferent to me.  Walked happily thru many zones exploring the unexplored and such.  Found out that GM's make GREAT pullers.  You should get one in your guild if you can...<br />
<br />
While being indiff to all, you can still aggro things like normal, just as if you aggroed a regular, indiff con mob when you are a normal player, with one exception, all the other nearby mobs will NOT assist.<br />
<br />
I am 100% that is how guides work as well....it is entirely possible that he did aggro RZ, but highly unlikely as he would have to attack him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Niafix</div><div class="date">11-14-2003, 10:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Think about last year, my guild was doing HoT, and a GM accidentally trained Zemm and his guards on our raid. After being beaten on for a good 20 seconds He FD'd and rezzed the kos people. :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Snowz</div><div class="date">11-14-2003, 12:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the best death to a GM was Aradune in Kedge because Brad forgot to equip enduring breath.</div></div><hr />
