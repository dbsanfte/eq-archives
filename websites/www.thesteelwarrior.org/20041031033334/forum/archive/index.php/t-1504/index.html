<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zerapheus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, due to the Knight's Mace that drops in the Jopal's village, I actually have a slew of support for the camp in Fire from my guild(lots of paladins and SK's in my guild who all want that to go with their Basalt shields from the Captain), so I have a few questions about that camp.<br />
<br />
As I understand it, the nameds spawn in the huts on the island.  But do they only spawn on the big island in the center?  Or can they spawn on any of the offshoot islands as well?  Any specific hut give a better &quot;chance&quot; at spawning a name?<br />
<br />
Secondly, does anyone know what PH's should be killed?  Or just kill everything in the huts and around them?<br />
<br />
Lastly, I know the mephit nameds can spawn there, but can the named Obsidian Spiders spawn there as well? I have some people who want the FT3 belt as well.<br />
<br />
Thanks for whatever assistance you can offer.</div></div><hr />

I could be wrong, but any spider spawn can have the chance of spawning the Obsidian War Spider. I have seen named in a lot of locations on that Island. Last one was the Seer on the island by its self. (mace =p )<br />
<br />
Any named in the Island area has the chance of dropping Sword or Mace. I believe the FT3 belt if from the field mobs only, Belt/Ranged/BL pet weapon.<br />
<br />
It has been discussed that the best way to obtain the Sword is to kill a named right after the servers come up.</div></div><hr />
