Bard Song Info<br />
<br />
To bring some light to the bard part of your problem the three most common songs for a MT during a raid and their effect would be (bare with the long explanation):<br />
<br />
Warsong of Zek<br />
1: Increase Attack Speed by 60% <br />
2: Increase STR by 36 (L62) to 37 (L65) <br />

<br />
Psalm of Veeshan<br />
1: Increase Damage Shield by 14 (L63) to 15 (L65) <br />

Correct me if I'm wrong please, this will go on my guild webpage when finished :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">08-06-2003, 06:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Holy crap Baadan, that's borked.  All that crap doesn't stack.<br />
<br />
I got a spawn to kill tho, i'll be back in a few and correct it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">08-06-2003, 06:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, here we go.<br />
<br />
Haste:<br />
Vallon's Quickening (ENC L65)<br />
2: Increase AGI by 52 <br />
3: Increase DEX by 33 <br />
4: Increase ATK by 41 <br />
5: Increase Attack Speed by 68% <br />
<br />
Captain Nalots Quickening (Eyepatch of Plunder)<br />
1: Increase Attack Speed by 20% <br />
<br />
Nalots effect and VQ don't stack.  The icons do, but you're not going to get extra haste.  So Nalots is useless.<br />
<br />
Rhino and Raptor don't stack with Focus, so those are scratched too.  In addition, Wrulan is completely useless because anyone who's grouped with a 65 shaman is going to max AGI with Ferine Avatar.  I'm not sure how Diaku stacks because I don't own that POS spell, but see above.  Completely useless with Avatar.<br />
<br />
I'm also fairly sure dain ring doesn't stack with shaman potion, so that cuts down your DS a lot.<br />
<br />
It's not as incorrect as I thought it was, but it does have a lot of extra crap in there, mostly the stat buff part.  Focus/Boar is about all you're going to get from a shaman unless they're bored, and I haven't even touched the Wrulon buffs since I scribed FA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vigdis SangCaru</div><div class="date">08-06-2003, 06:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, the easiest answer is it changes depending primarily on your unbuffed stamina versus max stamina.  I mean, there is a set amount of HP you can get from kazaad, blessing, Fo7 and brells.  Those HP are 2402, derived from:<br />
 <br />
Kazaad - 910<br />
Blessing - 618<br />
Fo7 - 544<br />
Brells - 330 <br />
<br />
<br />
Above and beyond that it all depends on how high you still need to go to reach maxed PP stamina.  Some of the warriors in my guild have almost maxed stamina so their Magelos are pretty sweet.  I'm a woodelf with okay, but not fantastic gear, so my stamina still has a long way to go.  The high-stamina warriors get very little HP upgrade from Boar;  I get significantly more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wolveren</div><div class="date">08-06-2003, 07:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You forgot Call of the Rathe, ranger spell: 10 damage shield and 34 AC, doesn't stack with Coldain ring buff which is annoying since I use that as insta clickie.<br />
Also the amount of hps you get from stamina buffs goes up with gaining natural/planar durability and physical enhancement AAs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baadan</div><div class="date">08-06-2003, 10:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fixed my post.<br />
<br />
And here is a question, given the choice, which one of these two would you choose?<br />
<br />
Call of the Rathe (RNG L62)<br />
2:  Increase Damage Shield by 10 <br />
3:  Increase AC by 34 <br />
<br />
Kilva's Skin of Flame (Potion)<br />
2:  Increase Damage Shield by 1 (L1) to 33 (L65)<br />
<br />
Also, does anyone know just how much Bards can up resists?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vladimoir</div><div class="date">08-07-2003, 01:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Given your 3 choices I use Call of the Rathe 99% of the time for the extra AC.  Rarely I use shaman DS potion against unslowable fast quad hitting mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vigdis SangCaru</div><div class="date">08-07-2003, 01:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally, I often go with CoTR and:<br />
<br />
Girdle of Living Flames, Spikecoat<br />
1: Increase AC by 23 (L39) to 25 (L44)<br />
2: Increase Damage Shield by 4</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">08-07-2003, 01:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Diaku stacks with everything.  It's actually somewhat useful for the average level 65 guy if you believe str/dex actually does anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taminy</div><div class="date">08-07-2003, 01:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A few buffs you are missing:<br />
<br />
<br />
Ferocity is nice. 150 ATK, 65 to all resists, and 40 to stamina. Only lasts 6.5 minutes and costs a peridot though.<br />
<br />
Also Spirit of Bih Li (shaman sow) adds 15 raw ATK. Not much, but could be substituted for resists if they aren't needed. Outdoor only though of course.<br />
<br />
Also some smaller clickies that can be used such as: grim aura (gobbo earring and other items), clicky aura of battle (fear shoulders + others), thorny shield/icicle aura (ntov/vt cloaks + others). <br />
<br />
Really I think trying to find a &quot;best buff setup&quot; is going to be impossible. There are too many buffs out there and many are quite situational.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rolsdar</div><div class="date">08-07-2003, 02:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ferocity is nice. 150 ATK, 65 to all resists, and 40 to stamina. Only lasts 6.5 minutes and costs a peridot though <br />
<br />
Ferocity doesnt cost a peridot anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baadan</div><div class="date">08-07-2003, 03:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Changed again.<br />
<br />
Added Ferocity.<br />
Added Spirit of Bih'Li.<br />
Removed 10th Ring and all other item effects. Item effects are too complicated, there are too many and not very mana people have access to them all, so sticking with Spells only gives everyone an equal chance at them.<br />
<br />
One more question: Do you go for 15 buffs or leave slots open?<br />
I know that if you have 15 and get dotted or something by a mob it overwrites your first buff. The buffs listed seems like all there is, but with them all it is 16 buffs, which could be trimmed by not having Bih'li or some of the resists or even the 60sta buff.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Daiku stacks with Focus, for whatever reason.  Pretty sure FA overwrites it though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Menia</div><div class="date">08-07-2003, 05:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Diaku stacks with both Focus and Ferine Avatar, that' the whole evil of it: At that point, it helps you only when you're naked, maybe, and takes up buff slots. First Buff to click away once it hits, even C5 has more use :)</div></div><hr />

all of these are group taps with fairly short duration stacks with ??? seen degeneration blocked a few times, but ac and atk seems okey, just dinged 56 so haven't tested that one much.</div></div><hr />

Heals over time, Spirit of the Wood (the dr001t AA), bard procs as a minimum. As mentioned, you may want to leave more open for mobs that have DoT/Debuff effects.</div></div><hr />

Too bad if you're the only one dead because you missed that MGB elixir.</div></div><hr />

Add that with:<br />

but in my experience if you have the buff slots free, the compiled BST buffs at 63+ beat Fo7 for HP.<br />
I am currently at roughly 4380 Unbuffed, and I can get to 7156 so far max buffs,and thats with a 65 BST(not sure if he has all his 65 buffs yet) buffs, Kazad/Pot9.<br />
Thats more than 2400 hp.<br />
Now yes with Fo7 instead of BST buffs I lose around 200 hp <br />
Go figure</div></div><hr />

Most shamans that I know did not go back and get IoS but most beastlords seem to have it.  According to Lucy IoS stacks with the traditional stamina buffs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
IoS is gotten by turning in an ethereal parchment to the Beastlord PoP spell guy.<br />
<br />
They will only outbuff a shaman if you're not stamina capped from normal stamina buff, that's where all the hp comes from, the 45 stamina on IoS, and Spiritual Vigor if you don't have a paladin.  Their highest hp buff is 395, but SV also adds 225 (same as BMB).  However if you have a paladin with BSS, you can't count that as it's in the same line. (All hybrids have a line of hp buffs that don't stack with each other, and casters can't touch)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kromagnon</div><div class="date">08-15-2003, 03:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As far as AC setups go you are missing a couple things:<br />
<br />
Until I get an Aegis of Earth, I am hardpressed to go over 2K AC.  So when I tank Xegony/FRo/Gintolaken/etc, I am in AC mode; a tiny bit of extra ATK/DS/AGI means nothing vs. survivability against a nearly untransitionable mob.<br />
<br />
Speed of the Shissar   (Xegony's AE overwrites SoV/VQ anyway.)<br />
Slot Description <br />
1:  Increase Attack Speed by 66% <br />
2:  Increase AGI by 40 <br />
4:  Increase Stamina Loss by 0 <br />
5:  Decrease Stamina Loss by 3 <br />
6:  Increase AC by 12 <br />
<br />
Niv's Harmonic <br />
Slot Description <br />
1:  Increase Absorb Magic Damage by 10 <br />
2:  Increase AC by 24<br />
<br />
Bard mods are capped at 3.6.  Ayonae's Tutelage will allow a bard to raise that cap, up to 3.9 (It might be 4.0, can't confirm).<br />
<br />
For singing, you can stack:<br />
- 1 instrument mod (epic, mask, etc)<br />
Epic is 0.8 mod<br />
Abalone Mask is 1.0 mod<br />
<br />
- Resonance (Voice of the Serpent) or Harmonize (Shadowsong Cloak)<br />
VoS is 0.6 mod <br />
ShadCloak is 0.9 mod <br />
<br />
- Amplification<br />
Amp lvl 60+ is 1.0 mod<br />
<br />
- Singing Mastery.<br />
SM3/IM3 is 0.6 mod<br />
<br />
base mod is 1.0 = 100% normal mod. <br />
<br />
With Bard epic + Singing Mastery 3 + Amplification + Harmonize<br />
1.0 + 0.8 + 0.6 + 1.0 + 0.9 = 4.3 mod<br />
 <br />
With Abalone Mask + Singing Mastery 3 + Amplification + Harmonize<br />
1.0 + 1.0 + 0.6 + 1.0 + 0.9 = 4.5 mod<br />
<br />
With the above and AT3, a bard will be over the cap, giving Niv's an effective 24 * 3.9 = +94 AC<br />
<br />
To compare, Psalm of Veeshan would only give me ( 7 * 3.9 ) = +27 AC...Plus Niv's has a longer range (75 vs. 50), keeping the bard out of AE/ramp range.  Let the other bards play resists if needed.<br />
<br />
With Nine + CotR + WoG + SoS, I gain 132 AC from buffs + bardsong (your milage may vary) for a total of +226 AC (we have good bards).<br />
<br />
Also, with maxxed STR/STA/DEX/AGI, I find the bard is more useful playing Niv's and CHA song.  Solon's Charismatic Concord is also singing-based, so it reaps the same benefits from Harm/Amp as Niv's (45 * 3.9 = +176 CHA).  Add Unfailing Reverence (SHM) for us oogly ogres and you are looking at +231 CHA, to help those Divine Interventions fire.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Learned about the bard cap, added mod infoz.</div></div><hr />

Edit : oops you edited sorry</div></div><hr />

<br />
When people say bard epic is 1.8 it's short hand for base + instrument.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Siilmaril</div><div class="date">09-01-2003, 08:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thought I'd add some more expert testimonial about bard songs:<br />
<br />
With IM3/SM3/AT3/Shei Cloak/Drums of the Rathe/Amp, the best AC twist is as follows:<br />
<br />
Psalm of Veeshan, for 23 AC<br />
Niv's Harmonic, for 89 AC<br />
Guardian Rythms, for 50 AC<br />
<br />
-----------<br />
<br />
162 AC total...<br />
<br />
On top of that, a bard can give you Nature's Melody for an additional 30 AC. However this doesn't stack with Spirit of the Wood, so beware when you use it.<br />
<br />
Total with NM click :<br />
192 AC total<br />
<br />

- Increase All Resists by 73 (L63) to 75 (L65) <br />
