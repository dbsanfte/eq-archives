<br />
<br />
This is what i notice ... i can hold aggro through slow with no procs (something i cannot always do with my duel wield), so i know the aggro with 0 procs is a good bit higher.  I plan on 150dd yak augging it to use as an offtank weapon ... low aggro grouping weapon (ie nobody in the group is generating much hate), while reserveing my duel wield for raid tanking and high dps/aggro groups where my hate is crucial.<br />
<br />
Normally i would beat myself up for even suggesting turning a dps weapon into a semiaggro weapon for semi-tanking, but i'm just plain in love with the BoWar look .. and people wet themselves when they see it after asking for a link.  i mean seriously ... imagine landing a successful quad followed by a flurry all in one round ... SICK!<br />
<br />
<br />
the questoin ... for this particular weapon would it be better to go flurry or PB first?  for aggro and for dps which is best?  i will get both eventually, but i'm looking for the best bang for my buck.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
and with removable augs on the horizon, i dont consider the larger yak proc to be a waste.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bardeil</div><div class="date">06-10-2004, 12:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My un-informed opinion says get flurry, because it'll work with your 1-handers as well. That being said, I believe it requires you to get CF3, as well, so PB might be the more economical route to eye-candy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">06-10-2004, 12:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">PB is better for the 2 hander imo,but, of course won't help you dualwielding.I'd like one with a yak aug for assisting too hehe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The general consensus I've found is that, assuming you're using one type much more often than the other, go for the hand-specific one.<br />
<br />
If you find yourself dual wielding much more, get Ambidexterity, then flurry.<br />
If you find yourself going 2h much more, get PB, then flurry.<br />
<br />
If you use them both an equal amount, get Ambidex and PB, then flurry.<br />
<br />
While flurry in and of itself is going to be a better skill once its maxed out, it requires you to get CF first, then has 6 levels to work on.  You'll get more bang for your buck, and sooner, if you do ambidex or PB (or hell, do em both! 2+4+6+9 &gt; 2+4+6+3+6+9+3+3+3)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Omnus</div><div class="date">06-10-2004, 04:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ferocity is prolly hands down the best offensive aa. Helps with 1hander and 2 handers, while being the best increased dps comapred to aa cost of any ability. So go ferocity before all other offensive aa, most of all when you use alot of both 2hand and 1handers.</div></div><hr />

flurry will cost more but benifit both.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agree with above: Ferocity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">06-11-2004, 11:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I prefer ferocity, simply because it works with every weapon type. I then went towards flurry until I got my BoW. Then I stopped and maxed PB. If you're not absolutely sure what you're going to be using, raise the AAs that add swings to both DW and 2handed. I chose ferocity before flurry, btw, because it's a heck of alot cheaper with no prerequisites. It sucks to get CF3 before investing any points into flurry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daabu</div><div class="date">06-11-2004, 01:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I didn't look at the magelo of the original poster before I answered.  In the thread above that I linked, Ferocity is listed #1 for DPS, and #2 for aggro (behind weapon affinity).  Ferocity clearly comes before Ambidex/PunishingBlade or Flurry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">06-11-2004, 01:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">with max flurry aa's .. how common or rare is flurry?</div></div><hr />

If not, given a 1-handed setup, would not ambidexterity be a better first choice?<br />
<br />
Ferocity for a 2hander user seems like a sure thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daabu</div><div class="date">06-11-2004, 02:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes.  Extra attacks means extra procs.<br />
<br />
Procrate is determined by your haste, dex, and your weapon delay, but not by your AAs (with the exception of Weapon Affinity).<br />
<br />
You will notice an increased procrate going from 0double attack to maxed double attack.  You will notice an increased procrate getting ferocity, flurry, PB/Ambidex.<br />
<br />
To answer the other question, this is just an eyeball figure, but flurry seems to go off about as often as a mainhand proc (twice per minute).  I havent parsed or seen any parses saying such.</div></div><hr />

It'd be cool if someone without any attack AAs could parse and compare to someone with the AAs, with the same dex and standard proc rate weapons, and see if there is a difference. All or nothing would suffice in a test like this.</div></div><hr />

Since when does extra attacks mean more procs?I am not aware of anyone *ever* suggesting that the bonus attacks from AA's are cancelled out of the proc rate.<br />
 <br />
Your *attack rate* is cancelled out of the proc rate. That means weapon delay multiplied by your haste percentage. That's all.<br />
 <br />
If you could point at a place where it was demonstrated that AA's are factored out of proc rate, I would be interested. To my knowledge nobody has ever done so.<br />
 <br />
My own experience suggests that extra swings from double-attack skill are not factored out, either. I have not parsed it, but from playing twinks, it appears to me that proc rate ramps up linearly with double-attack skill.<br />
 <br />
Edit - Daabu's Sassitranslator is working, read his post :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Extra Attacks does contribute to increased proc-rate.  Nobody ever really said it didnt.  PB will increase your proc rate, as will ferocity and flurry.<br />
<br />
<br />
Am I right, Sassinak?  Were you just agreeing with me?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">06-11-2004, 05:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For all we know about procs, it could be a random chance based off of the relevent statistics, set up as a point in time, and rounded to the attack round nearest to that time. We don't actually *know* that procs are based off of any per swing chance. We generally assume that, based off of the relevent numbers, each swing is given a likelyhood of proccing. It doesn't HAVE to be that way.</div></div><hr />

After ambidex, offhand procrate went from one proc every 77seconds to one proc every 48 seconds (going from memory, too lazy to click again)</div></div><hr />

<br />
After ambidex, offhand procrate went from one proc every 77seconds to one proc every 48 seconds (going from memory, too lazy to click again)<br />
<br />
There's only one problem with this post: the original parses are no longer available at the links it provides, and the math in the post (unless I am very much mistaken) is flat-out wrong.<br />
<br />
You'll note that in the first parse the off-hand proc (non-melee) fired 732 times over the course of 02:11:36 which is an off-hand proc every 77 seconds.<br />
<br />
In the second parse, the off-hand proc fired 1476 times over 04:02:50 which is an off-hand proc every 47 seconds.<br />
<br />
But 2:11:36 is 7896 seconds for 732 procs, or 10.79 seconds/proc. or 5.567 procs per minute.  Given that the normal offhand proc rate is 1 PPM at 305 dex, I'm simply not believing that he was getting over 5 PPM from his offhand.  And given that, his whole assertion becomes questionable.<br />
<br />
Similarly, 4:02:50 is 14570 seconds for 1476 procs, or 9.87 seconds per proc.  That's 6.07 PPM.  <br />
<br />
His numbers show ambidexterity changing the offhand attacks from 45.24% of all attacks to 47.37% of all attacks (9086/(9086+10999) to 11865/(11865+13185)).  That's a 4.7% increase in offhand attacks ((47.37-45.24)/45.24), or a 1.5% increase in total attacks ((1.4737-1.4525)/1.4524).  Unless I screwed up my math somewhere (which is entirely possible).<br />
<br />
Yet the author describes a 7% increase in offhand attacks.  So once again, we have a disparity of numbers.<br />
<br />
In any case, I find it difficult to believe that a 7% increase in offhand attacks can move you from an offhand proc every 77 seconds to an offhand proc every 47 seconds. <br />
<br />
The numbers just don't add up.  Unless someone can provide either the original parses, or point out where my math is wrong, I think we're going to have to move this back to the &quot;unproven&quot; category.<br />
<br />
Any help?<br />
<br />
Take care,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mokor Leadheaad</div><div class="date">06-12-2004, 01:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">from my understanding thats probably way rong.<br />
<br />
you get a set chance per swing averaging out to a normal 2pp excluding any mods or &lt;305 dex. haste lowers your chance per swing to proc slow increases it, but you also attack more = out to the 2ppm. pb flurry fero should do the excact same thing more swing in the given time = 2ppm. a side benifit is you may get that proc early though hitting the rng proc spot sooner.<br />
<br />
also it seams to be attack round based thats why rampage makes bunch a procs go off at once 30-50 attacks at the same moment. unless the aa's mentioned cause a seperate round they shouldn't affect ppm.<br />
<br />
i could be way off as stated though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yep, I have PLG and it does dumb dps, way under greatstaff. I've only used mine for Duels, and some discs.  Greatstaff would be better for aggro and dps in any situation.</div></div><hr />

Think of the first swing as an extra aggro proc or something (If it's even near this much aggro, I don't know). Getting 2 rounds in before a slow might actually keep aggro on ya. Sure, it wouldn't be more aggro over time, but it might be interesting to think about whether or not the initial swing aggro would justify switching in a heavy hitting, slow weapon on incoming.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. i like the way it looks<br />
2. i like the 45ac<br />
3. i like the way it looks<br />
4. because i want too ...<br />
5. because relative newb jaws drop when they see the link<br />
6. .... you get the idea?<br />
<br />
i know it wont beat my gsofw for dps.  i know it wont hold aggro like my duel wield.  its actual dps is very low unless i have some mad attack buffs, but i HAVE noticed that with 0 procs it ALWAYS holds aggro through an almost immediate tash + slow.... my greatstaff cannot do this, and i dont know why because the staff does better dps 90% of the time.<br />
<br />
over time my aggro setups are ranked as such (with no PLG proc)<br />
boc/gbos (anger3) &gt; gsofw (yak) &gt; PLG (no proc)<br />
<br />
with absolutely no procs my aggro is as such<br />
PLG &gt; GSoFW &gt; Duel wield<br />
<br />
bottom line:  i spent a long time getting it, and i like it very much.  because it holds aggro very well with 0 procs (especially through a fast tash and slow), this weapon is nigh on perfect for offtanking stuff.   i imagine the aggro on it with a yak proc might even be better than my gsofw ... and with enough 2hander aa and the right attack buffs, i bet it might even outdamage it now and then.<br />

<br />
couldnt have said it better myself.  this is a situational toy for me and nothing more.  i'm not pretending it is anything other than such.<br />
<br />
ps- its cool to have a pretend BoWar and get inspected every 10 seconds.<br />
<br />
*edit- to date i have parsed at max 150dps with my gsofw with 0 offensive aa's (my luckiest run with bard overhaste).  on my very best PLG parse i hit 165dps ... <br />
<br />
average PLG parse is 90-100dps<br />
average GSoFW parse is 110-120dps<br />
its all luck with the big badass ... and generally it sucks ... i just think it would be cool to land 6 hits all for 500+ in the same attack round (ideally possible).... and 45ac + decent reliable (no procs needed) aggro makes it useful in limited situations.</div></div><hr />
