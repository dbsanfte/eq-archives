The seedlings are apparently unstunnable now, and seem to continue to spawn rapidly.  We managed to get him down to 60 with about 30 people.  Also, we never could get him split from his 2 guards, we tried pacification and I think we avoided one of them.</div></div><hr />

As he grows he hits harder so you and healers need to be aware that healing requirements increase as the fight progresses.<br />
<br />
On a seperate note, I have never been able to corner this piece of crap even with Gnome Illusion, anyone else had problems cornering this mob or better yet, been successful cornering it?<br />

Choppin, I know they depop when he's dead, are you sure that AE mez still works?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FulorianC</div><div class="date">02-17-2004, 12:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Acoyle of Affliction hits for like 200. Burn him down. Uh. Don't let your pullers be fucktwats and agro him before your ready. Don't agro him at all until your ready, if he comes with adds, so what.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomos</div><div class="date">02-17-2004, 01:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We are a small guild, our usual raid force is 30-35, we can't burn anything down.  It takes us 13-14 minutes to kill AOW.<br />
<br />
AA creates tons of level 60 seedlings during the fight that swarm over the healers and kill them.  We don't have the DPS to kill AA fast enough to just blow him up, so we need a strat to control the adds.<br />
<br />
BTW, AA hit me for a max of 579.  This is pretty gimp compared to some of the other stuff in the zone, and especially for a miniboss, but it's more than 200.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lady Tarnia</div><div class="date">02-17-2004, 01:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">AE mez worked Sat night.  Went in with about 24 folks, short on DPS.  Lost our bard that pulled AOA singly, 2 clerics and a druid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grendonbb</div><div class="date">02-17-2004, 01:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't even need to use ae mez... just have encs mez them /shrug we've done him with 36ish peeps, and never had problems.  But if you can't take him down, I'm curious as to how you plan to take out Mareeq...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bigchest</div><div class="date">02-18-2004, 12:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah i was thinking the same thing as grendon, mareeq is signifigantly tougher than anything else in the tower, id say about as hard as saryrn and if you dont either have tons of dps or tons of zerg hes gonna be tough</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VerangVF</div><div class="date">02-18-2004, 11:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">iirc Maareq also summons about 10x the adds that AoA does... not to mention about 3x more HPs.  Might want to recruit some more DPS...<br />
<br />
yeah, 579 is gimp... but, Ta'Grush will wake some healers up with 2k trips (</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bulbog</div><div class="date">02-18-2004, 08:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Eh haven't done saryrn clear in a while but Acoylte's adds actually will hit people while Mareeq's adds just walk up to him and heal him.  Could be wrong though, can't remember.  Best mini is the one that hits for like 3500 hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomos</div><div class="date">02-18-2004, 09:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My info on Mareeq says that stun no longer works on the little mombs he spawns.  However, these don't attack people, instead they are absorbed by Mareeq.  Generally, we plan to just tank him, with a RT set up from the start for when he starts to get his melee abilities.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nergal</div><div class="date">02-19-2004, 10:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">How do you kill Acolyte of Affliction (PoTorment) Why bother?  The mini's aren't worth the effort, just clear/lull past them and go gank Sarynn.<br />
<br />
My info on Mareeq says that stun no longer works on the little mombs he spawns. However, these don't attack people, instead they are absorbed by Mareeq.That is correct.  Mareeq's little buggers are completely non-interactive.  You can't do anything to them (although I guess an ogre wall could block them...dunno).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bigchest</div><div class="date">02-19-2004, 10:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">you need serious dps on mareeq though gnomos, if youre having trouble with the acolytes low hp youlle have no chance against mareeq with sick regen, tons of HP, and ae rampage</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FulorianC</div><div class="date">02-19-2004, 11:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">IIRC, you cannot open the door to Saryrn with minis up. Or did they gimp that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bigchest</div><div class="date">02-20-2004, 10:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">probably, alot of guilds on bertoxx commit suicide at the zone in, get dragged by saryrn tower keyed rogue and get rezzed into the far side of saryrns room</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jakle Attakle</div><div class="date">02-20-2004, 01:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How exactly did the rogue get through if you cannot open the door?<br />
<br />
and did they use staff of rites when there?<br />
<br />
/el boggle-o!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FulorianC</div><div class="date">02-20-2004, 01:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe they camp a rogue and cleric there. Who knows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crystara</div><div class="date">02-21-2004, 03:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just the front door is locked, just need A Screaming Sphere on your keyring to open it.  You can drag through it easily also.  Can either use a rez stick or have a cleric camped there.</div></div><hr />
