<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Roorni</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">HI I upgraded a few things, but still need to raise my HP and AC and possibly my Dex.  <br />
<br />
I usually group with a pally, cleric and beastlord.  We work well together and I usually manage to hold the agro.  But I think I still need more HP and AC.  I finally made some plat and am wondering what I should get to raise my HP and AC.  Have around 150k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Heh, you are in a similar situation to where I am, although in most slots my gear is a bit better.  I would say level to 55, get some ornate.  Bracers would be a huge upgrade for you and they are fairly inexpensive as far as ornate goes.  Replace your orc fang earring with either a bloodmetal earring, or a blood earring of rage, or an iron scream.  I would also look at upgrading your cloak to something like a fine dark cloak, or cloak of greater pernicity.  So I'd recommend new earring, new cloak, and some ornate, specifically bracers.  You could also go with a CoF and sell your soulscream and get a HRG and probably still have some pp to pick up one of the above.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bonequest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">At your level, you should do everything you can to increase hit points because you are probably going to be fighting in places like PoS and BoT etc. to level up and you want to be able to absorb as much damage as you can so that you can survive mobs that hit 400+.<br />
<br />
I would replace the neck item with a velium black saphire necklace first off.  Its like 65 hp and 15 AC is not nearly as useful when your unbuffed hit points are under 3k.  You need to raise hit points above all else.<br />
<br />
To get the best total hp increase for your plat, go to the bazaar and look at items one slot at a time.  Write down whats there how many hp, how much AC, how much it costs.  Then when you have a list for every slot, look at various combos (write down on paper) and come up with the best combination that increases your hit points.  Use AC as tie breaker only for now, it is secondary to hit points now (later on at higher levels it becomes a bit more important than it is now).  Take your time, look at what is availiable and don't blow all your plat on an item that increases just 1 slot hp when there might be a combination of 4 other items for less plat that will give a bigger total hp gain.  <br />
<br />
As Telen noted, consider your chances at getting ornate from raids and exp groups.  In BoT for example, ornate wrists and arms are fairly easy to get while you need to go to places like plane of tactics Sol Ro tower for the other slots to drop fairly commonly.  Don't buy the ornate if you have a chance of it dropping for you, I got 2 ornate wrists in 3 hours in a BoT exp group and it would have cost like 50k each to buy them on my server at that time.</div></div><hr />
