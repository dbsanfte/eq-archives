This is as interseting to create a parse from a warrior which us defensiv every 3 minutes out of 10. You will call such a parse interesting?<br />
<br />
Stun migration come near defensiv and can be even better as lower the mobs is. But it is more limited because level/resists and immunmobs.<br />

While stun mitigate goes from 0% to 100% depending on the mob.<br />
<br />
But what makes Arbosh so angry is that while the def disc 's power scale naturally with the power of the mob. the stun mitigation don't. it goes to 0% as soon as the mob is above lvl 65 or is stun immune. and a Paladin can actually reach 'stun lock' only on mob lvl 61 and under (they have 78% at best for a lvl 65).<br />
<br />
this is the reason why a paladin in exp group can plow through trash easily and get smached on the final miniboss, while the warrior will have a slower progression trough trash (he won't use his disc because it  give weak mitigation agaisnt weak mob) and in the final fight he will take it easy with the disc.<br />
<br />
Arbosh, if a warrior chain def disc as soon as it refresh in the trash clearing, he won't have more than 10% mitigation and he takes the risk to be oblage to wait for the disc refresh or worse for the end regen for the final miniboss. rmember that Paladin's stun use mana (thus FT, fucus, ...) but disc use endurance (+3 via AA, lol).</div></div><hr />

If you think knights can migrate 100% you have no idea how stuns work. There dont exist a single mob in this game where i can avoid 100% damage with stuns. <br />
If you really think this you simple dont know how stuns work. I have to keep the mob stunned the full time. If he get out of stun for 0,0001 sec. he will hit me. The mob do an attack asap when he get out of stun. Allso stuns only stun between 0 to 4 sec. No stun will keep a mob stunned for longer then 4 sec.<br />

Stuns make trival stuff even more trival and nothing else at the moment. You can talk as much you want. That is the effect they have. <br />

yes you can but they are unatractive to a lvl 65 (worst exemple being a decaying skeleton :) ).<br />

then cast another stun so that their effects overlap.<br />

OK they have a huge recast time, and the lower one are even shorter than a casting time, but they number allow a Paladin of lvl 65 to chain cast them from far away not to be hit during the few milisec inbetween. after it's the DPS group to take care to kill the mob before you run out of mana. And once again it doesn't work all the time, it's mob dependant.<br />

Stuns make trival stuff even more trival and nothing else at the moment. You can talk as much you want. That is the effect they have. <br />

Yes that's what I said, the power of stun is inverse to the power of the mob thats why you whinne so much.</div></div><hr />

Like i said you dont know how stun work. It say it has 10 sec. duration in the descritption but every stun is hardcoded to break after 4 sec. So if there stay 1000sec. or 4 sec. ingame the effect will be the same. If it is a stun he is hardcoded to break after 4 sec. So you see there is no way that i can stun even a level 1 mob for 100%. <br />

It was the VAST majority, but SoE reigned it in a little bit when Knight complaints caused them to look at the trials and some of the zones again. A group with both a Paladin stunning and an Monk with a SoT was a bit overwhelming.<br />
<br />
Yes, if stunning wasn't a huge advantage, then SoE wouldn't have bothered reducing the population of stunable mobs and Paladins wouldn't have complained bitterly when they did so.<br />

Damm i am ready to give them up. If they are balanced against defensiv if knights get stuns removed and warrior defensiv we should be balanced or?<br />
<br />
This is what i want. Have defensiv and stuns remove from the game. Then everything is great because both have there tools removed which are equal and so we are balanced.<br />
<br />
Please make clear what stuns mean for you.<br />
<br />
Form your posting i have the feeling that you guys think stuns are as powrefull as defensiv. But when i will give this as powerfull tool as defensv you call it way less powerfull. So aslong we have it it is more powerfull but when we will remove this more powefull tool you call it way, way less powerfull. Sound strange.<br />
<br />
Oh and spelldescription != reality. Stuns are hardcoded. You will not see a 10sec paladin stun land for 10sec. They are hardcoded to last 0 to 4 sec. Then a mob will break the stun. Odd that you gus dont know that our 10sec. stun only last 4sec. Dont make this this stuns way less powerfull? That only make them 4/10 as powerfull then you guys think they are. Odd or?<br />

OK I /bow , but still 7 stun spell with a casting time inferior to 2.5s and a duration of 4s or above (even caped at 4s) with the longest recast of 24s. given you have 8 spell gems. you theorically can be able to lock 100% of the time a mob so if you stay away from it you should not get smached. Actually you only need <br />
Ancient Force of Chaos (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4977&amp;source=Live) 4s/65 (1s/12s) @ lvl 65 , Force of Akilae (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3245&amp;source=Live) 4s/65 (1s/12s) @ lvl 62 , Force of Akera (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3975&amp;source=Live) 4s/61 (1s/12s) @ lvl 53  and Stun (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=216&amp;source=Live) 4s/55 (1.5s/12s) @ lvl 30 to create a chain stun 100% effective with between 2.5s and 3s for  your reflexe time plus game's recovery time plus moving to the next gem time plus click time. you would consume (without focus) 290 mana every rotation so 12s.<br />
so ok it works only on lvl 55 and lower and it assume no resist no immunity and no fizzle (Game part) plus a good timing and a good experience with stun (player part, in which I don't fit ;) ) and a large mana pool and a nice fucus/FT combinaison to be able to sustain it few minutes.<br />
<br />
So once again I say it's theorically possible. But on practice It's at best unusefull. Nevertheless the thread Stun Mitigation on trash mob in Tipt by an ealy EP Paladin (http://p202.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathfrm13.showPrevMessage?topicID=2736.topic) show that the DPS reduction is between 41% and 77%  (with a 64% in average) compared to a charmed pet, so compared to a early EP warrior it would change a bit. but still the stun mitigation exist and can be very powerfull (it was the question on the first post). this is why it's has such huge flaws built in.<br />
<br />
So Arbosh, we all know, since july 2003, here on the TSW that you are a very  baised person. As a proof, you could have explain the stun mitigation yourself , starting from the theory to end on the field experience on single/multiple Paladin(s) chain stun. You could have explained the power of your spellbook and then point out the flaws. And then finish with a propositon to help doing your role with your spellbook. But you are just trolling and whinning here for one year.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">07-16-2004, 06:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If there is no defensive warriors would just mitigate 10% more than anyone else (or more) by default and you'd be complaining about that instead.  Knights seem to have this warped vision that everything is somehow supposed to be equally tankable.  That's not how this game works.  A Warrior tanks better than a Knight absolutely and it doesn't matter if it's defensive or if a Warrior just takes 10% less damage off everything.  <br />
<br />
Of course it is not balanced on tanking.  Warriors are the best, like the way it is supposed to be.  To be asking for balance is asking for imbalance against the Warrior class, which sacrifices utility for being the best at tanking.  You're supposed to be balanced by the things you do besides tanking.  Now maybe you think what you do besides tanking isn't sufficeint and that's open to debate but you're never supposed to be a Warrior's equal in tanking in ANY circumstances.  Be happy that for a class that started out as 75% melee you have around 95% of all encounters (as in, all encounters from yard trash to mini boss to ubers) where the usage of tanks is indifferent due to gear inflation.</div></div><hr />

Defensive/evasive/stonewall have all been parsed extensively.  Yes it would be interesting to see a stun parse, odds are it would end this debate (possibly in your favor as well/possibly not).<br />
<br />
Do you have any non subjective reference (parse etc) that shows that stuns are hard coded for 4 secs (I'd guess most of us here are fairly in the dark regarding this as warriors)?  Or is this purely subjective observation on your part?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Good question. but i think he might be partialy right on this one. Now that I think about it, I remember tha SoE nerfed partially stun not to be uber powerfull for tanking, they putted a &quot;root like&quot; nerf : ie every 4s (root is every tick I think) the mob has a chance to break stun if he has received domage. Making thus long stun still usefull for &quot;RUNNNNNN&quot; and for little CC but less effective for tanking. But as I said, the multiplication of them has breaked this nerf (at least for the lower lvl mob) cause 100%  DPS reduction is available again.</div></div><hr />

It's Spellbook and Knight Disciplines vs. Warrior Disciplines. Knights chose a spellbook, not 100% focused tanking. Are you willing to give up your spellbook and become a Warrior?<br />
<br />
I would guess the amount of time needed to PL a Warrior to 65, get 120ish AA points for the most necessary abilities, and get flagged would take a month or two at most. The amount of time needed to find a Warrior already beyond that state on Player Aucs is even less.<br />
<br />
No, some Knights expect to tank just like a Warrior (except for a Warrior MT preference on raid day on the raid boss mob only) AND have powerful spellsbooks. They don't want to be Warriors, they had gotten used to being in almost all situations being Warrior+ and would like that restored.<br />

Whether theyre 10sec or 4sec has no effect on the state of the classes imo, mobs werent meant to be stun tanked. I still dont believe theyre 4sec unless you show me some proof though. Actually, I'll check it myself.<br />
<br />
edit: Couldnt test myself but had a friend test it with me (he wasnt sure if it had been changed since he never uses it because of the dmg component), lasted 6-7sec the 3 times we did it.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trilith</div><div class="date">07-19-2004, 12:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Battleblade, you make it sound like the warrior is the tank class with every other class being something else and the occasional one able to fill your role.  Knights, especially modern ones, do not fit in that idea.  You have three tanks who do their jobs in slightly different ways, but they are all tanks.  Modern knights did not trade tanking (I'm talking about it in the broader sense, not strictly mitigation) for the ability to play a poor cleric.  It could be argued that most modern knights decided that tanking purely through mitigation was not fun enough and they wanted to deal with the problem of tanking through a variety of tools.  <br />
<br />
Stuns, healing, buffs are all tools for tanking, even if they do not deal with mitigation in its purest sense.  The knight spell book is overwhelmingly slanted in favor of tanking tools, so it is unrealistic to say they *traded* tanking *for* the spellbook, their tanking *is* their spellbook.  Or, atleast it should be.  <br />
<br />
I would, however, be interested in seeing the numbers play out in the initial question.  Preferrably on larger platform.  I don't really care too much which way things end up being showed, but I have no doubts that both extremes will be negated.  The idea that knights are constantly cutting the dps of mobs from 900-300 and the one that knight tools are completely ineffective.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The original post was about a discrepancy between Paladins and Shadowknights. We all know that warriors tank the best. We had our bar raised recently enough and I know some of the warrior community seethe at the mention of the other two tank classes but there does seem to be some truth to the Paladin vs. SK argument. Changes are coming for much of EQ and while a seriously doubt SOE would give any other class a &quot;defensive&quot; disc there will be changes to the way our tank-cousins mitigate damage. If stuns put Paladins ahead of Shadowknights and we do not want to see anyone else get a semi-defensive disc perhaps we should try to start a constructive dialog about how that discrepancy could be fixed. If we offer nothing to the argument other then bickering and lashing out about knights tanking we may just end up seeing our &quot;class defining disc&quot; given out to them. <br />
<br />
So, other then removing all the SK's from your guild and ignoring their calls for more tanking and defined raid abilities how would you alter the current status quo?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">07-25-2004, 04:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It seems to me, reading the SK Class Description, that one obvious change should be a crippling debuff that is unique. This combined with a new and more effective lifetap and a new pet could easily accomplish the same thing add tanking or in an experiance group.<br />
<br />
As to Trilith's comments - changes are coming, but I don't believe SoE is going to re-invent the game at this point. Traditional roles will be preserved. There are no &quot;modern&quot; Knights. There are Knights that have alternately exceeded or lagged the capabilities and roles outlined in their Class Descriptions.<br />
<br />
SoE will be re-evaluating Class Descriptions from a class definition standpoint. I think SK's may find themselves an equally acceptable experiance group tank but with a cripple the mob, high DPS from a variety of sources, Add Tank/CC, puller support role in raids more than perhaps being able to duplicate Warrior tanking under Defensive by another means.<br />

I think a Medium Tank/support raid add tanking/CC role will be ultimately defined and..... Knights will turn out to have many of the capabilities needed to perform it superlatively.<br />
<br />
Add tanking does not require a Knight has a part of the Warrior defining class ability that has been theirs alone among frontline tanks for four years. A 12 second &quot;ut-oh&quot; autoparry disc would more than suffice to give healers a chance to turn their attention to an SK in trouble.<br />
<br />
Classes will be distinct and have roles which justify their existance as unique classes. &quot;Class blurring&quot; (good riddance) is dead.<br />
<br />
If not, and we end up with 3 different and equal raid tanks (2 with spellbooks and one a specialist with no specialist's advantage), well there are other games.<br />
