<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone else think its a bit unnecessary to be forced to wait half an hour to retrieve a corpse in GoD instanced zones?  Frustrating as hell after two hours of dungeon crawling to have to wait with your thumb up your ass for 30 minutes because someone in your group made a stupid mistake or something.<br />
<br />
Yes i know it was the same in LDoN with instanced zones, but LDoN was a piece of shit expansion rivaled only by legacy of yekesha (I think the trolls at least would agree the bank space wasnt worth it.)<br />
<br />
Is it too much to ask to have a regular GY like in good ole PoP?  Im guessing there is some ridiculous programming bullshit involved, like it would take 30 minutes to program a regular GY but only 10 minutes to program a GY that would annoy every player that doesnt have the entire collected series of fucking Different Strokes to occupy them in those magical Barindu moments of pure suck that they can pop in the old VCR while everyone in their group decides....well guys its getting past my bed time and my grandmother needs to tuck me in soon, /wave enchanter.....Sooo guys think im off to feed my fish, /wave cleric....Soon all you are left with is your trusty necro, who was so amazed that he even got a group that he forgot to FD so that he could rez your asses.<br />
<br />
Also, im actively looking for chimp that sony hired to create natimbi so that i can tie him to my computer desk and use him as a new ashtray.  Ok /rant off, time to own GoD...for the trolls!<br />
<br />
oh and P.S. if you post about how you think LoY was an amazing experience, or about how you love to have necros in your groups on a regular basis (i do too actually) plz make your own topic so i dont have to look at it.</div></div><hr />

I for one will never be doing any Barindu hard missions with a weak group just because of the hassle of a CR.  Nothing like running to Barindu and realize the body isn't coming out in 30 minutes and then get killed in Barindu while waiting for the instance to finally end.<br />

Graveyards are one of the worst things that ever happened to EQ.  <br />
<br />
If there was no GY in PoP zones, where would the dr00ds pull mobs to then.(j/k) I LOVE LDoN, can't get people to be online much anymore, so I will never get flagged or raid in PoP. In fact ranking them:<br />
LoY sucked the worst<br />
PoP sucked second worst<br />
GoD sucks too<br />
At least for the 100+ people in my guild, when we get 20 maybe to a raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Derrict</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Many forget the CR experiences we've had before graveyards were implemented.  Yeah, it stinks when your rezzer dies several times trying to get back but it's part of the game.  PoP and LDoN has spoiled us into making things take less time.<br />
<br />
My only beef is the lack of a bind point closer to some of these zones along with backspawns in the instanced zones.  Add in see invis mobs to the instance and you're going to have a problem getting the rezzer back to the group if you don't have a mage available.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>cuedyen2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">If there were no GYs, how many low level peeps would there have been in PoP zones dying where they should not have been?<br />
<br />
GYs eliminate some of the need to be careful...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Back in the day we actually fought back to our corpses when we died.  If you couldn't do that, you probably shouldn't be there.  But on the bright side, you have a few hours while you figure out how to get a necro to summon you out to think about what you did wrong.<br />
<br />
The death penalty needs to be in the game.  Everyone hated it while it was in, but now that it's gone, it's quite obvious why it needs to be there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Khumak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I couldn't disagree more.  IMO graveyards are one of the biggest improvements to the game thus far.  Graveyards encourage people to try stuff that's more dangerous than they otherwise would.  Before graveyards you pretty much never did anything dangerous without a cleric and a rogue or necro.  With graveyards there's no longer a class restriction.  <br />
<br />
If I go try something risky and we wipe, we wait 20 minutes, loot up and either try again or go do something else.  Without graveyards if the same happened we'd have to either try and fight our way back to the area in CR gear and somehow succeed at fighting through an encounter with crappy gear that we failed at with our usual gear or sit around with our thumbs up our asses til we could find a rogue to drag our corpses or a necro to summon them.  All that did was encourage people to shun anything that had an element of danger.<br />
<br />
I remember falling down the well in Karnor's Castle once and having to wait almost a week before I could get a necro to summon my corpse.  I could care less about the xp loss but a death should not deprive you of the ability to play the game for days at a time.<br />
<br />
I also remember going LD in Howling Stones when my ISP was having issues and waiting over a week before I could get help doing CR.  Yeah those were the good old days... NOT!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Sure all of us have an extra set of elemental gear to help us fight back to where we die.  Right.<br />
<br />
There's no challenge at all to fight back to where you died in CR gear.  Actually with how tough stuff are in Gates you'll just get shredded in the process most likely unless you actually have a set of EP gear in the bank (I do, but that's not the point).  <br />
<br />
And I'd seriously like to see someone fight back to their body in any of the quest instance zones.  You and what gear will get through the double 1200 mobs that abound?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">All that did was encourage people to shun anything that had an element of danger. <br />
<br />
No offense Khumak, because I don't intend any, but I take issue with this.<br />
<br />
People who were skilled were always doing things that had an element of danger just because they were dangerous.  It was the crowd that had to sit on the zone wall or the zone line and pull to there. <br />
<br />
Not having a graveyard never stopped me from doing anything I've done, and I've done it all.  Yup, sure is a bitch to get a corpse outta HS or the Crypt in Seb, but Bloodpoints and Hiero cloaks were worth A LOT of money for a long time. <br />
<br />
It used to be Risk = Reward.  Now it's just reward.</div></div><hr />

<br />
lmao<br />
<br />
 Yeah graveyards suck.  Sorry but as many have said, without graveyards there isnt any 'real' risk.  Worst case is you lose 20 mins.  Oh no whatever will we do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I hope this was the first week of kunark or something.  It's not that hard to get to the KC basement :p  Any half-way competent monk should be able to get it out of there.  Hell with IU you can probably drag it out of there yourself without aggroing a single mob.  Waited a week for a necro?  <br />

<br />
And yes, I have had to do corpse runs with multiple deaths, and yes, I know what it was like before Graveyards and necro summoning.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ah well,  I'm glad 3 hour corpse runs are gone from newer zones.  Because personally, spending the time to get my group going again isn't fun compared to whatever exploring I can do. <br />
<br />
Everquest just isn't dangerous anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">No one should ever say &quot;At least there is a graveyard.&quot; <br />
<br />
I was responding as to how the original poster was miffed for having to wait to get their corpse. I've been at this since just before Kunark, and I know all to well what a corpse run is all about. I wasn't advocating the introduction of graveyards, but rather pointing out what seemed the obvious.<br />
<br />
and...<br />
<br />
I may sound like a pussy, but I like graveyards. Just for the fact that I personally dislike spending 2, 3 hours getting my corpse back after dying. <br />
<br />
I can relate to that statement also. It's not like I enjoy the downtime associated with a corpse run given my limited play time. If I log in with 3-4 hours to play I don't really like spending the majority of it on a CR.<br />
<br />
edit:<br />
<br />
LDoN was a piece of shit expansion.<br />
<br />
Even though LDoN is boring as hell I've gotten more groups, upgrades, and AA's with that expansion than any other to date. This new expansion reminds me of LoY, but with mobs that run at Cheetah speed, and hit like bosses. 1022 hits from yard trash that dropping nothing of worth, what's up with that? I'm still waiting to see what GoD has to offer atm. Right now it looks like gate and invis potions, or a wiz/druid are needed to do much grouping. It's so spread out with a ton of mobs in the way. Getting a replacement will be difficult, and running back to the wayfarer camp doesn't appear to be a viable option either. Seems to require a solid group to even play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Dafrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I'm one of those people that like difficulty I suppose. I'd like to see some high end content without graveyards. There's a rush knowing your decisions each step of the way have a measure of consequences above just waiting a few minutes for your body to pop at your feet. Some of my favorite times was also acquiring my corpse deep in a dungeon basement. I remember a Guk CR that really took some planning and was a fun challeng.<br />
<br />
Ofcourse I like quests also. I guess those can be considered painful at times as well. Getting exp to me is not the only reward EQ provides. My reward can also come from things which provide no experience at all, but provide a challenge i.e. acquiring my body.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">i liked the GYs in that it allowed for people to pick up the peices and move on without hampering (and training) another group<br />
<br />
what i didnt like was no ability to opt out when you planned to be ressed, REALLY bad when your doing raids and someone cant hail the flagging NPC.<br />
<br />
im sorry some of ya like to eat nails for breakfast or get enemas for fun but i like the option of NOT getting another group killed or making 3 or 4 more corpses, think of BoT without one, TRAIN TO ZONE, TRIAN TO SAVE SPOT&lt;damn monks&gt;!<br />
<br />
the thing is it stops alot of chickenshits from gating, or running when they have 40% health, and more of a zone can be used because there isnt a need for a train to zone super highway to be clear at all times</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">If there were no GY that just means eventually everyone would find a necro (or maybe get a necro bot) to summon corpses.<br />
<br />
I don't see anything challenging about that.  As a warrior when running back to my corpse if invis falls I'm dead, and there's no challenge nor skill in having invisibilty not fall.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I prefer to do shit that is challenging, pushing the group.  But if you wipe, cr gear rarely is good enough to live in that kind of place to get corpses back.  Take Ferubi, decently difficult trash mobs, harder than LDoN high risk mobs, but easier to pull.  However, it takes a while to move far with just a group.  There is also these wandering mobs that see invis and even see rogue SoS.  They pretty much wander everywhere.  To wipe with just one group there means getting a necro basically.  Even if you have the cr gear in the bank, it takes a long time to clear that stuff.  A gy in this zone would be nice heh, but it's also a raid zone, so maybe thats why it's not there.  Anyway, just an example of how some zones are these days, where a cr isn't really a challenge it's just get a necro.  The game has changed since when we all did our long cr's with gear from the bank and it was a worthy challenge.  Back in the day, I was damn good at cr'ing, and thought it was good for the game, but it's just not the same anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I personally would like to see no GY but a dude to who you can hand in 1kpp in high end zone (lower ammounts depending on lvl requierment of a zone) and he will get you your corpse. No time limit at all but the danger is loosing 1k if you screw up. I hate waiting for 15min or 30 min. Waiting sucks period I'd rather be sending tells to necros to get CR going then wait.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Minna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I have to say I like the graveyards, heck I think every zone should have them.  When it comes down to it, ever since coffins were introduced, there was no real penalty or risk to dieng if you had friends.  Doing an hour long CR is not fun, doesn't make me think about what happened, it just makes me want to quit.  And as for the original topic, I agree as soon as you leave the instance, your corpse should pop.  There are enough time sinks that we all need to work our way through without the unproductive time of cr's.  And for those that say GY brought idiots to zones where they shouldn't be, think back on it, hard.  They were always there anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Doing an hour long CR is not fun, doesn't make me think about what happened, it just makes me want to quit <br />
<br />
Huh, it made me want to play better so I didn't have an hour long CR to do tomorrow.<br />
<br />
Funny that when some people are faced with the choice of learning how to play the game or quit, quitting is the easier thing to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">The challenge is from the encounter not the time it takes to CR.  As long as you have friend who can summon the challenge is effectively 0 if you're willing to pay, and most of us certainly am, so the only bottleneck is waiting/finding for a summoner even in the worst possible wipeouts.<br />
<br />
If whenever you die in Plane of Valor your corpse is lost forever, this doesn't somehow make Plane of Valor yard trash challenging.  It just means you'd be stupid to fight there.  And I'm starting to feel like this about Gates instance dungeons.  It's just stupid to fight with anything other than a stacked or at the very least a compentent group (and such groups are harder than one might think to find) because of how difficult it is to CR if you screw up.</div></div><hr />

A lot of deaths are simply unavoidable but if there's a cleric to rez it's a lot more painless.  <br />
