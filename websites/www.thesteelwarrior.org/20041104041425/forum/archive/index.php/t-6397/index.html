<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Karog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I would appreciate it if someone would help an aspiring warrior with equipment suggestions. I am lvl 37 Orge Warrior.<br />

Thanks in advanced.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">get levels .. your gear is fine for now ;) <br />
<br />
once you get closer to 45 start saving up for a full set of fierce heraldic .. and if you find aggro to be a problem you can always buy a frostbringer or a pair of yak short swords (cheap alternative)<br />
<br />
<br />
cheap upgrades you can make now are a pair of 65hp 6ac jewlcrafted rings, and a full set of crusty armor if you can swing it.   youre good on haste and weapons, but i would look to replace any items with no or low ac/hps and start replacing them with cheap items with more ac/hps ... or in the case of crustacean armor, raw stamina.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Karog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks for the advice, I'll get some lvls and post my progress. <br />
<br />
I really appreciate you taking the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Fro what it's worth, I agree with Apolyon. Your rings are a good spot to start looking for the cheapest upgrades, but really you're not in bad shape: go kill stuff dead.<br />
While you're in the bazaar searching for upgrades you can afford, do start searching for the Fierce Heraldic armor and get a feel for the price of it on your server, so you know what sort of pp you need to be saving up. It's a big jump from crusty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>zito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">As the other posters have said, keep levelling up, and start thinking about upgrading to fierce heraldic gear.  You might also want to think about upgrading your weapons as well, as you'll soon be at the level where good agro weapons will make a difference.  A good one might be Frostbringer, usually pretty cheap in the bazaar (right now on D Ro, they go for about the same, or maybe a few hundred pp more than your centi LS).  Also, again like others posted, your jewellery as well.  A vah shir claw earring might be not too bad, depending on the price.  If you have a bit more pp, you also might want to check out an Earring of the Solstice package.  Decent stats/hp/saves.  As well, keep doing the LDoN's, both to build up your point totals for some of the very nice LDoN gear that's available, and as well to increase the stats on your adventure stone.  Every bit helps.</div></div><hr />

I am also a lvl 37 Ogre war/diety-Rallos Zek/Server- Fennin Ro. I would have to agree with everyone else except for the Fierce Heraldic gear. Better off with Crimson Darkscale. <br />
Of course I don't know how the economy is on Saryn but on Fennin Ro Crimson Darkscale is cheaper than Heraldic with better AC. On Fennin Ro CD sells for around 5k to 7k per piece. I was lucky enough to be in the Bazaar when someone auctioned helm/arms/bracer X2/ and legs for 2k each because he was about to delete his War. I asked him if he would give me a price break if I bought all 5 pieces and he sold it all to me for 9K. Since then I have picked up the BP for 7K and the boots for 5k. <br />
<br />
See my magelo for my complete setup.<br />
Good luck.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Karog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I just wanted to thank you all for your suggestions, I am now lvl 43 with a few Fierce Herldic gear. And a great earring i just picked up, I dont know why mageloos isn't working for me right now but i'll get it figured out. Thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ohbb's comments suggest two really important things for young warriors to keep in mind when they read gear suggestions here: first, different servers have different economies (and one server's economy will shift a bit over time). Thus, there can be some variability in relative prices of gear in the same general level of functionality.  Much of the standard gear recommendations (crusty/crafted, LDoN armor, player-made cultural armor such as Fierce Heraldic and Tundra armors) should really serve as baselines for your bazaar searches. Search by slot, your race, class, religion and budget to get the best bang for your buck.<br />
Also, here's a tip: LDoN armor such as gothic, sandblasted etc. often ends up being sold to the vendors in PoK that are right next to the forge. For example, vendors there will sell the 27 AC breastplate for around 95-110 plat depending on your CHA. You will be hard pressed to find a 27 AC breastplate for less in the bazaar, but it can happen. The main thing is to check both places and get the best bang for your buck.<br />
Also you should check your server's price on opal encrusted steins. They give you 25 CHA. Even if you buy no gear at all from vendors, the steins will eventually pay for themselves if you equip them when you sell your vendor loot.</div></div><hr />
