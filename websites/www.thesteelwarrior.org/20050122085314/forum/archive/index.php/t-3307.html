I asume this is what I need, because alot of creature in POP I am unable to hit with what I am making currently, so I guess my plan with just making the cheap long distance low damage pulling arrows is out. So if you could please tell me what I need as in compnents for making the cheapest magic arrows :) thanks..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sivok Kovis</div><div class="date">09-29-2003, 03:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Any arrow made with the bladed tip, or what is now referred to as the Silver Tip, is now (as of 1-20-2000) considered magical, and will hit magic-only creatures such as ghouls and willowisps. <br />
<br />
Found my own answer :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">09-29-2003, 03:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The absolute cheapest are mage-summoned arrows.  Next cheapest would be made in a fletching kit using silver tips, wood shafts, large nocks, and round fletchings.  Trivial at 182 fletching.<br />
<br />
You can improve their range by using small nocks and parabolic fletchings for a very small additional fee.  Increasing the damage rating, on the other hand, can dramatically increase the cost of the arrows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">09-29-2003, 03:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A really cheap method is the new arrow summon bag.  Bloody Ancille's Pouch.  After first purchace (fairly cheap cause it's common) it costs 5gp max for the component and you get 20 arrows for it.  They are only 1 damage and 25 range, but are the cheapest method short of a mage.  NOTE: They do not say magic, but they DO hit magic mobs (even PoP).  Many, including myself, have tested it and proven it so.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for info.<br />
<br />
But for kicks, where do I get one of those bags? :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
In bazaar for 5-8k or they drop in normal Mistmoore adventures in LDoN and are fairly common, I had 2 drop in one adventure and have seen a couple more since then despite not doing much LDoN.</div></div><hr />
