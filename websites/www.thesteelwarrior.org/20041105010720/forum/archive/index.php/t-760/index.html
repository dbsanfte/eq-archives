<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Compo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My friends and I (Chanter, Cleric and Warrior) have been hunting in HoH for a while. HoH is really a quiet and peaceful place to hunt in. Plenty of static spawns and extremely easy to pull after pacified. The only complains I have is It gets boring fast and loots are kinda poor. We have gotten 1 spectral parchment and 1 Defender's lightblade. For the time we spent, we may have gotten slightly better exp and better loots (metallic Liquid) from PoV golems. Anyway, it's still a good exp-grinding zones. <br />
<br />
Recently, we moved to Tactic just to give it a shot. I was disappointed with this zone even more. The Oggie hits harder and I notice they quad (vs triple hit in HoH and PoV) and mitigate slow. But they seem to have less AC as I was doing more dmg on average to them. Again, it’s a quiet and peaceful place. We also tried the pit. Mobs are easier to handle down there except for ADDs. In terms of loots, we have yet to get any worth-mentioning loots. <br />
<br />
I was wondering if anyone can share their experience of these zones like any named mobs and loots.<br />
<br />
Thanks in Advance.</div></div><hr />

 Theres a couple of easy named there( the piglet from the stampede and a named wraith thing) who can drop some ok items and specs/runes, and also apparently ornate armour which I've never seen heh. War Boars can drop the gold tipped boar horns used in the Cloak of Greater Pernicity too.<br />
<br />
Also theres DC pets for your chanter there (Young War Boar or something)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">farm ogres for earring components, sell for 50k. easiest runes are off the 65 named in bot, they drop nothing but a key container most the time, but one group doable and spawn daily.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Heh, pull pit same as HoH, use pacify =)<br />
There is a named for each type of mob in the pit (wraith, zek initiate, boar, etc).  Loot is rare though, which is pretty annoying.  Watch for the stampedes, they are fairly blind, so keep tight on the wall when they come through.  If you get aggro from the stampede, you don't have much of a chance.  The piglet spawns with every stampede also, but takes some work to get used to how to get him without the rest.<br />
There is also BoT, which is a pretty enjoyable zone, except that it's turned into KCv2.0 on most servers.  But if you can ignore those people, the exp is pretty good, and the named can drop some loot.  But, BoT is like every single other PoP zone I've been in... loot is rare!  There is a boss per each wing, on a 6 hour spawn timer, they have the best chance of loot (though are often empty).  The minor named rarely ever drop anything.  Also, use pacify to pull here also, works well.</div></div><hr />
