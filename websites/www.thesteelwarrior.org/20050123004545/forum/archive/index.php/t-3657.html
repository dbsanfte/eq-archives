So far Ive been strictly in BB(Mistmoor).Should I be somewhere else?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xenephex</div><div class="date">10-14-2003, 05:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are 5 different levels of the various armor types, each costing, respectively, 1492, 760, 442, 150 and 48 Adventure points.  The five different warrior sets are in 5 different camps.  <br />
<br />
The best (1492) set is in Takish-Hiz, the 760 is in Miragul's, the 442 is in Guk, and I don't remember where the other two are.</div></div><hr />

Buy. Love. Buy Augs. Love more. Replace someday. Cry, but not hard.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dugman</div><div class="date">10-15-2003, 04:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was curious about comparing ornate to fully augmented LDoN armor.  Here's a sample:<br />
<br />
<br />
Ornate gloves:<br />
AC 33, STR 4, DEX 5, STA 8, AGI 3, HP 60<br />
Fire 6, Cold 3, Poison 6<br />
Miraculous Visions (30% haste buff spell)<br />
one type 7 slot<br />
(example: +12 hit points aug)<br />
<br />
<br />
Royal attendant gauntlets of sand<br />
AC 34, STR 8, STA 6, AGI 5, HP/MANA 75<br />
Fire 7, Disease 7, Cold 7<br />
Two type 2 slots, one type 3 slot<br />
(example: Vengence IV aug and two +40 hit point augs)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Note that without any augments the two armors are pretty close.  But because type 2 and type 3 augments are so nice compared to type 7, if you fully augment the LDoN armor it probably beats the ornate.  In the example of gloves, I'd say Vengence IV and +80 hit points is better in a group than a haste buff spell (not a worn effect) and 12 hit points.  After all, how often are you in a group and not already hasted with a better spell?  The ornate is better if you're solo or have no haster.<br />
<br />
<br />
I guess bottom line, though, they're both really, really nice and I wouldn't turn either one down short of something like elemental armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draganetti</div><div class="date">10-15-2003, 04:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The above poster is fairly off.  The max hps you can add to either of those gloves now is 40hp.  One is a type2 40hp aug from tak, the other is a type7 40hp aug from ruj.  The newly patched LDoN armor has type1, type2, type3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dakryn</div><div class="date">10-15-2003, 09:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah, a fellow [Karanian?] <br />
<br />
Anyway, if you check my Magelo you can see that pretty much the only upgrade is going to be the royal attendant armor...The next step down may be a SLIGHT upgrade,havent seen links, but not going to waste points on a minimal upgrade.<br />
<br />
So basically the max hp is 40,plus maybe the ability to tack on some Vengence or other neat toys such as see invis or EB or whatever.<br />
Still better the the HoT BP I currently use</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Partha</div><div class="date">10-15-2003, 09:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Still sounds like a pretty equivalent tradeoff in terms of time invested, tho. I mean, 1492 points still ain't chickenfeed unless you're already EP/Time geared, and then more points for augs.....might be less time consuming just to go farm up an Ornate BP.<br />
<br />
 Hell if I know, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dakryn</div><div class="date">10-15-2003, 09:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh,easier said than done.Ive tanked for more than my share of Icestorm raids but have I ever gotten a Ornate BP ? noooo.<br />
Worst kind is the increasingly noob infested Open Raids.<br />
40 plate wearers all show up for just the Ice Raid(which of course means there is no DPS and he winds of taking 10+ minutes to kill),and though [I] may be the one doing the majority of the work every time,still comes down to the random roll of the dice,and my dice are the worst on Karana(if you dont believe me ask my friends,they will tell you my dice suck lol)<br />
So despite the numerous Ornate BPs I have seen drop,I have yet to aquire one.I have a better bet amassing the points.<br />
At least I will get exp at the same time,although not much(Im spoiled by PoP AA exp)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draganetti</div><div class="date">10-16-2003, 05:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">By all means, if a piece of takish armor is an upgrade for you without any augmentations, then it's a great buy.  You just can't stack as many hps on them as before the patch.  The brestplate originally was 210hp max.  Reducing this to 170hp max would have been fair in my opinion (40hp aug plus a 30hp aug, both type 2). . .but they nerfed it down to 140hps max.  I would say now that the LDoN bp is pretty equivalent to an ornate BP.  I think knights, clerics, and bards are going to find the takish armor much more appealing than warriors due to the mana and higher AC than they are used to normally seeing.  For myself, i'll be getting one bracer, with 40hp aug, 8% dodge aug, and like charisma or something.  Type one is the suck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">10-16-2003, 02:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As usual, SOE screws the pooch when trying to balance new items. Has they made the augment changes and left the armor alone, then LDoN would be a step above Ornate and old world armor, but a step below elem+ armor. It would have given the casual player pretty good armor to work for and the ubers an option to fill in weak spots with decent items. The nerfed armor is equal to ornate at best.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wudedorm</div><div class="date">10-16-2003, 03:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Id have to agree, I had wanted to upgrade a good chunk of slots with Tak armor and was pushing my points at resonable pace9was busy on emp key/shards during same time). Then nerf hit, now I am looking at just using augments to upgrade any armor I own/get soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dakryn</div><div class="date">10-16-2003, 07:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">At least you get what you earn...not bound over to fate of the dice &lt;grin&gt;</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think it is actually inferior to the bracer/boots.  Why?  Because you can double stack Veng on these (the ornate have native VENG) with Ornate and not with LDoN.  Sure you get a type 1/2 with LDoN but on those pieces is the &gt; than the normal Veng?<br />
<br />
To be frank: SoE really screwed the pooch on this nerf.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dakryn</div><div class="date">10-17-2003, 04:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Only ornate I have is the 2 bracers(drops all the time is why)<br />
So not worried about the bracers</div></div><hr />
