My guild is pretty much capable of the other agro weapons(ie. BoC Bloodfrenzy Hategiver)<br />
<br />
what weapon should i sorta hold out on? We have plenty of active warriors so i doubt i'll get both or something so if i had to choose one to set my eyes on which should i do?</div></div><hr />

Hes right but for the wrong reasons.<br />
<br />
riposte mod does diddly<br />
<br />
25 AC is nice, but its maybe a 1-2% overall increase in your tanking ability<br />
<br />
125 hp is nice, but its maybe a 1-2% overall increase in your tanking ability depending what its replacing<br />
<br />
The real reason you should hold out for a bloodfrenzy, is because no other 1h proccing weapon in game comes anywhere near the aggro a BF does due to its high innate proc rate.<br />
<br />
Bloodfrenzy procs 50% more per minute than a BoC or Hategiver.<br />
<br />
Bloodfrenzy + boc or hategiver offhand = top aggro in game (yes more aggro in the long run than Blade of War, although your relying on procs rather than DPS)<br />
<br />
Getting a bloodfrenzy if you currently have say BoC+ primal or some other combo will up your aggro by 50% or more.<br />
<br />
Hold out for the bloodfrenzy, there is no replacement for it on fights where guild DPS (and therefore MT aggro generation) is key.<br />
<br />
Edit: forgot to add, now that ripostes have been tuned down, dual weilding seems to be a little bit better opetion on 2K+ hitting mobs.</div></div><hr />

Cursed is slightly contested on most servers as well, if not rotated. if you have the chance to take a superior agro weapon, you should.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brudal the Fat</div><div class="date">04-23-2003, 01:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use a Boc now but as soon as a Bloodfrenzy drops again I will be bidding on it. Boc is a great weapon and better than Hategiver but its no Bloodfrenzy.<br />
<br />
Out of our 24+ Cursed kills we have had 1 Bloodfrenzy drop. Out of maybe 10+ AoW kills we had 4 Bocs. Finally out of 30+ XTC kills we had 1 hategiver to give you an idea of drop rates.<br />
<br />
If you want my personal Advise I would say take the first one you can because holding out may screw you in the end. Rather have 1 of the 3 than none of the 3.</div></div><hr />
