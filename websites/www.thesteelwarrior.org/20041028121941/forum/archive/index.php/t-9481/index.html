<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rueeliar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been unable to find any parses showing how much of an increase procrates over 305 would give, and what kind of advantage we would be looking at for warrior aggro when 440 Dex becomes the raid standard.  And so, I did a short parse to gauge it... and was very shocked by the results.<br />
<br />
WA5, CE 0, 435 Dex, parse length 60.00 minutes. Journeyman's Walking Stick, auged with a Warm Emerald Shard.<br />
Tashani procs - 147 (2.45ppm)<br />
Heated Blade procs - 147 (2.45ppm)<br />
Shroud of Discord procs - 120 (2.00ppm)<br />
Touch of the Cursed procs - 115 (1.92ppm)<br />
<br />
Only had 62 minutes on the Wunshi's when I arrived after running to get the aug from the Nro camp. My only two-proc weapons are 2handers, and I have no desire to kill Exterminator Glurg. That makes for crappy parses when your test mob dies.<br />
<br />
WA5, CE 0, 340 Dex, parse length 60.00 minutes. Journeyman's Walking Stick, auged with a Warm Emerald Shard.<br />
Tashani procs - 163 (2.71ppm)<br />
Heated Blade procs - 167 (2.78ppm)<br />
Shroud of Discord procs - 130 (2.17ppm)<br />
Touch of the Cursed procs - 123 (2.05ppm)<br />
<br />
First of all, I admit that this sample size is small. 60 minutes leaves a standard deviation that is rather high... but even so, these numbers disturb me.  I would write this off to bad strings in the RNG, except that across four different procs, they all demonstrated exactly the same trend.<br />
<br />
MORE procs at 340 Dexterity than 435.  9.73ppm versus 8.82ppm. A difference of 54 procs per hour in favor of 340 Dexterity over 435 Dexterity. This is wrong. This should NOT be how it works. Dexterity has long been accepted as the basic way of determining procrate. A higher Dexterity meant more procs. However, this would make it appear (across the board for weapon procs, augment procs, buff procs, and AA procs) that increasing Dexterity over 350 creates a DECREASE in procrate.<br />
<br />
If I had the time, I would have repeated this test at exactly 355 Dex and again at 305 for perfect control sets, but I do not find myself with the luxury of that much time.  Also, I would prefer if I could manage to make these parses longer for greater reliability, but the mob doesn't have the hit points to take extensive testing (these two hours with a weapon chosen for low dps left him at 22 percent, which means a single eight-hour parse per 4 days or so with his weak regen) and is conveniently placed for ease of access, ease of push prevention to avoid OOR messages, etc.<br />
<br />
If possible, I would appreciate it if someone else could test this as well.  I would be pleased as punch to be proven wrong about this.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>R27</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Those numbers look odd. Dexterity shouldn't matter for your self imbued proc(shroud of discord) rate. Should always be 2 procs per min.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>WaardarMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">2.0 vs 2.17 on shroud of discord, that's just standard deviation for a 60 minute parse.<br />
<br />
I've been wondering about this myself. Anyone with the ability to sustain max dex wanna parse this?</div></div><hr />
