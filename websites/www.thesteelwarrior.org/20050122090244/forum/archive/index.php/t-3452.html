<br />
I could use some help from you guys. Ive seem to have been stuck at this ac hp level for a while now. I would appreciate any ideas you had for bumping up my hps to about 5k plus. <br />
<br />
Ive also been having a hard time seeing how i can get my ac up to about 1300 unbuffed.<br />
<br />
currently my guild is only about 20 plus, all around lvl 65s. we can do vindi doom etc but haven't really been able to progress further than that although if we can get a few more peeps i think we will try and hit places like NToV.<br />
<br />
i know theres a few items i should change - like the rings and get some valorium rings, im just saving the pp for em. but even that wont make a big diff ac/hp wise imo.<br />
<br />
i know i could get more ornate, or the new ldon drops too, but i was wondering whether there are any other options available.<br />
<br />
thanks for any help you can give<br />
<br />
click my name for my magelo link. thanks</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sam DeathWalker</div><div class="date">10-06-2003, 12:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My magelo is basically &quot;best of bazzar&quot; items. Find out what polished gems sell for on yur server (random drop in PoTactics) - used to make the bloodmetal ears and just hunt Dakiua (or however its spelled) all day, gets very very solid EXP and at 8Kpp or more per 50 or so kills for the gem you can bankroll yur purchases. Thats what I do and looks at the stuffs I gots.... Im a 250 JC and can turn those into the ears though.<br />
<br />
Umm yur level 65... both ears gots to go for the bloodmetal ear, and rings for the valor - you have 2 ornate already which is a big plus. Just improve in yur worst slots, some of your stuff is really good and some is junks. <br />
<br />
You need to do some raids and get the charm for the planes, you have nothing in your charm slot.<br />
<br />
And the bracer gots to go.<br />
<br />
Then you want to get the BP I have for the 300HP (and some 35 AC) self sheild that and upgrade all the jewerly slots should meet yur goal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GSW</div><div class="date">10-06-2003, 12:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heavy Rubicite Girdle, Mithril Boots/Boots of the storm, Valorium Rings, Bloodmetal Earrings, new shoulders - Chokidai Hide Shoulderpads, Horn Spiked Shoulderpads, etc. If you have the money, get an Obsidianwood Compound Bow for the 100hp in range slot. Also, probably try getting ornate greaves. Ornate bracers stink IMO, they only cost 50k because it's FT2 for clerics - don't get them. <br />
<br />
Your guild might be able to do BoT towers, or at least some of them. Many guilds go there to get lots of gear easily and get geared up for higher planes and such. You can get an ornate breastplate, greatblade of storms, and probably some other stuff there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would say his bracers are fine on HP, I really wouldnt sacrifice HP for AC on a cultural. I *think* the Ornate bracers are better than the Benevolence on both HP and AC plus they have Vengeance, they often drop off Thangbrand (if my memory serves me well) in BoT.<br />
As far as the BP, 2 groups can do just fine in HoT and maybe you get lucky with a SS BP to replace your Thurg.<br />
Blood metal earrings of Engagement are good replacements for your earrings, somehow Diaku Armsmans seemed to drop the gems in my experience, tho I think it can be of any Diaku. You also have Blood Earring of Rage, but it has less HP than your current earrings.<br />
Eyepatch of Plunder has more AC/HP than your current mask if you are planning on questing it.<br />
Valorium rings went down on price (at least on my server) and are more accesible to poor warriors (like myself :p ).<br />
As for the Range item, I quested one from PoHate (check my magelo) which has more HP but less AC than yours, the quest is not hard and you just need 4 drops off mobs in Hate (all lvl60 and lower).</div></div><hr />
