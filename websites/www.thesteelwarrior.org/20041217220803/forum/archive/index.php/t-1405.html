or<br />
Furious Taunt IV<br />
<br />
would the answer to our aggro problems be a decrease in taunt delay?<br />
<br />
saye make a few low level Furious Taunt I warrior only focus armor. then add some higher up for sk's and Pallys but keep the class balance and warrior only the 3-7. Seeing as pallys and sk's dont need help with aggro but we do.<br />
<br />
haow about retro-fitting some of the thurg/hot/kael helms with FT1?<br />
<br />
better armor better FT.<br />
<br />
donno but that sound simple to me..<br />
<br />
They dont have to change the way taunt works<br />
they add a few items to the game that lowers your taunt time and everyone is happy.<br />
<br />
then again i could be smoking crack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">landrain</div><div class="date">06-21-2003, 08:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">how about melee focus items?<br />
<br />
quickened taunt? - decrease taunt time<br />
<br />
extended range taunt? - increase taunt range<br />
<br />
irritating blow? - add hate<br />
<br />
range conservation? - ranged attack doesnt use ammo<br />
<br />
I am really disappointed that the melee version of FT is Vengance, How can they even think that V compares to FT and its effects? Casters have focus items for just about everything...</div></div><hr />

<br />
this is good suggestion :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Choppin</div><div class="date">06-21-2003, 01:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah sure... i'd take +aggro focus on armor but,<br />
<br />
remember that a ton of armor that warriors use, also other classes use (VT/ssra gear) and they might not want to have those focus effects on them.<br />
<br />
/shrug I'd rather see a hate modifier added to Bash/Kick *as well as* adding +aggro on Warlords/Myrmidons/Champions/Berserkers/Kizraks/Raex armor. Or maybe create a new AA skill with the same usage timer as bash/kick,  hate modifier increasing with level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bunnie Burner</div><div class="date">06-21-2003, 06:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd love a vast range of melee items.<br />
<br />
<br />
Stuff like, Irritating Blow that only affect 1hb weapons.<br />
Deep Puncture that only affect piercers.<br />
Clean Cut that only affect slashing weapons.<br />
<br />
One of the things that horribly overpowered casters over melees were the focus items.<br />
<br />
And I think that all the warrior problems could be easily solved by intelligently designing melee focus items.<br />
<br />
Furious Bash was a start.. a crap one... but a start.<br />
<br />
<br />
We could start a thread with a compendium of possible Focus for melees? :)<br />
<br />
<br />
example:<br />
-----------------<br />
Frenzied Cut I, II, III, IV, V<br />
<br />
heightens the chances of a proc off a Slashing Weapon by 10%, 25%, 45%, 70%, 100%<br />
------------------<br />
<br />
Irritating Blow I, II, III<br />
<br />
Gives every 1hb weapon a Hate bonus of 10, 25, 50 hate.<br />
-------------------<br />
<br />
Soluzek's Devastation I, II, III, IV<br />
<br />
All DD oriented procs deal 10%, 25%, 50%, 75% more damage!<br />
<br />
-------------------<br />
<br />
Stunning Kick I, II, III<br />
<br />
Lengthens the stun off a Kick by 1 second, 2 seconds, 3 second<br />
<br />
<br />
etc etc......................<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I would be extremely happy if these were the only changes made for melees :),<br />
as long as they are WELL made and Balanced!... but that might be asking too much :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raaj</div><div class="date">06-21-2003, 08:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Melee focus items are a good idea, and fit in with the idea that warriors are so dependant on gear. I can see that happening, since Furious Bash is already put in, albeit broken.<br />
<br />
If they added a quickened taunt though it might also be useful to add some aggregate value to a taunt. A successful taunt could be Max agro+50, a failed taunt just the 50 hate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then perhaps they ought not to use the item?<br />
<br />
You know, Rangers and Paladins can WIELD a Blade of War. Doesn't mean they should be running around bidding hard earned DKP's or cybzoring their guild loot officers for a shot at the Blade of War does it?<br />
<br />
It's not outside the realm of possibility that some Warrior centric gear actually make it live is it?<br />
<br />
:-)</div></div><hr />

<br />
but I am a firm beliver that the sussess/failure of taunt past lvl 60 is fine.. before that its crap(this would help lower levels as well)<br />
<br />
a hastened taunt focus effect &quot;furious taunt&quot; should be added. <br />
<br />
if you add hate to the taunt you basicly make taunt too powerfull.<br />
<br />
personally if the shammy goes &quot;what i only threw 4 dots on it and am meleeing it too&quot; he needs to <br />
<br />
1. be able to take the hits<br />
2. control his aggro.</div></div><hr />

Well actually I meant for SoE going back and adding aggro focus on already existing items that multiple classes can use, is a bad idea... I have 5 VT items that also many other non-warriors in my guild use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">landrain</div><div class="date">06-22-2003, 09:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye... but for one thing.<br />
<br />
Every other class has some form of aggro control to lower their aggro....<br />
<br />
Pal - root<br />
SK - FD<br />
Monk- FD<br />
Ranger - jolt<br />
Rogue - evade<br />
Nec - Fd<br />
Wiz - Concussion<br />
Enc - all kinds..<br />
Cleric - root<br />
Shaman - root<br />
Druid - root<br />
Mage pet/root<br />
<br />
warrrior.... uhhh arent we the ones supposed to be hit?</div></div><hr />

At 100% chance to proc wouldn't the weapon proc every single swing? That screams of inbalance to me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
by &quot;heightens the chances&quot; it means it will proc 100% more.  as in, at level 5, if you already proc 100%, then you will proc 200% with the added effect.<br />
<br />
twice the procs, not consistent procs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Thing that is great about Focus items,<br />
is it will be a possible fix for ALL melees out there. Not just warriors.<br />
<br />
You could have DEaggro focuses too for rogues and monks.<br />
Or Kick focuses for monks, or backstab focuses etc etc....<br />
<br />
The possiblities are infinite!!<br />
<br />
<br />
And I do believe that submitting a whole list of usefull and interesting Focus ideas for melees, will have a FAR greater chance of entering the game, then any other possible idea.<br />
<br />
Reason:<br />
It's using an idea that is already ingame, and it's flattering to propose it as a fix for us.<br />
<br />
<br />
The only problem, would be adding Focus items to all already existant items... <br />
but they have already done it with great success for casters..<br />
<br />
Now its our turn :)<br />
<br />
<br />
And Tasso,<br />
but I am a firm beliver that the sussess/failure of taunt past lvl 60 is fine <br />
<br />
As it is now, a warrior can go on with 5 taunts, without getting aggro back from a slow.<br />
That is 30 seconds, aka a whole fight....<br />
<br />
A WHOLE fight where you can't get the mob off the shaman,<br />
and we are level 65, veteran warriors with big experience in combat...<br />
yet we can't insult a mob good enough for a whole 30seconds?..<br />
<br />
Either Taunt is horrible now... we need a 90% success rate.<br />
OR give us other means of getting the aggro back (and no, high end uber weapons that proc EB like hell don't count).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tasso</div><div class="date">06-22-2003, 02:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As it is now, a warrior can go on with 5 taunts, without getting aggro back from a slow. <br />
<br />
hmmm ill have to set up a 2 hotkeys and a channel and do some testing<br />
<br />
1. /doability 1<br />
/6 taunting<br />
2. /6 taunt failed<br />
<br />
with that ill try to get some solid numbers for the sucess rate.. at this point it is 90% by what i see.<br />
<br />
as an example<br />
bot exp group<br />
giant inc with soft aggro (proximity)<br />
shammy assists and malos on incoming<br />
starts casting slow as soon as the gem lights up<br />
slow hits the mob turns on the shammy i hit taunt and its on me 9 times out of 10. solid aggro lock and it never hits the shammy.<br />
<br />
<br />
now this bring up times you cant taunt somthing off sombody. I think that has somthing to do with the hatelist.<br />
<br />
When do i notice i cannot get taunt to work? When the slower<br />
chain casts slow and its resisted, after 2 reists the shammy needs to hold off a sec becasue that 3rd one will get him aggro that I can fail on. <br />
<br />
We are all under the understanding that taunt is top of aggro list + 1<br />
<br />
but when sombody does somthing insainly stupid (like chain cast 3-4 slows on the mob) this opens up the window for a fail. (we are warriors we can handle 2 64th lvl mobs beating on us unslowed. thats what defensive is for)<br />
<br />
I think that fail is due to a hatelist cap. say the max number is 10,000<br />
<br />
if you are at 10,000 hate nobody can taunt it off of you because a success would mean 10,001 and that cant be so it fails.<br />
<br />
like tanking a mob and you want to switch out defensive warriors. at 2 min into the defensive cycle, a non aoetaunt warrior has to start taunting in order to switch to him by the time 3 min are up(from the few times i have seen it)<br />
<br />
The first time i did it i turnd off attack at 2 min 30 sec and the other warrior who did not have aoe taunt barly got it off me. He was taunting a good 60 sec before it would turn to him.<br />
<br />
So the hate cap looks like it could be a possibility at that point.<br />
<br />
Aoe taunt might reset the hatelist or do somthing else to allow you to get aggro even if sombody is currently at that cap.<br />
<br />
But in a normal situation (like my shammy friend who loves casting posion dots because the mobs drop to fast for disease) i can see that taunt working 99% of the time..<br />
<br />
turns on him on the dot tick<br />
hit taunt and its on me<br />
6 sec later it turns on him<br />
hit taunt and its on me<br />
6 sec later it turns on him<br />
<br />
its annoying but if my jbow dont proc i see that happening. But i also see taunt working fine. <br />
<br />
100% aggro lock with no risk to the group is not what I call fun. Thats boring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hulanta</div><div class="date">06-22-2003, 02:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What about a focus effect that takes away 50% of the agro established by the other 5 people in your group and applies 10% of that agro onto the person with the focus item?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">06-22-2003, 05:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;Well actually I meant for SoE going back and adding aggro focus on already existing items that multiple classes can use,&quot;<br />
<br />
Ah, my bad. I read that wrong then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bunnie Burner</div><div class="date">06-22-2003, 06:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hulanta, such a focus cant exist ;)<br />
<br />
I would be way too easy to exploit it. (Have wizards grouped with a warrior, and voila!.. warrior could just go afk, and all the wizards will have their aggro reduced by 50% :/.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bellringer_zeb</div><div class="date">06-23-2003, 09:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is a pet peeve of mine, and a reason warriors have a heck of a time getting groups over knights.  Barring the higher end weapons beyond epics you have a heck of a time with agro.  It is easy to lose and hard to regain for the typical warrior.<br />
<br />
So far I like some of the ideas in this thread, I would really like to see warriors as THE tanks in the game again, others can do the job if we are not available, but we are primary picks.<br />
<br />
*to the trolling knights*<br />
I know you do not like that above statement, pm instead of derailing thread if you feel you have to say something to me about it.</div></div><hr />
