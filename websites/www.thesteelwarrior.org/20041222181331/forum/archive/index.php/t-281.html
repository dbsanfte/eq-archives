<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 04:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We all know PoP is sevely fooked up on max hit (3000+ are common)<br />
<br />
We all know 2H is THE WAY TO GO, both for DPS and AGRO<br />
(but not for HP)<br />
<br />
But the question :<br />
<br />
We have all head about the &quot;riposte rate Change&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Is it true ? im not looking for data (unless u have some)<br />
<br />
Mostly input from XP groups and personal feeling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grimmlokk</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 04:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1: If it was changed it's not a &quot;nerf&quot; as people keep saying. It's a fix, and a positive one.<br />
<br />
2: I notice zero difference. When I'm not tanking I'm generally still in the frontal arc of the mob for balance purposes and I seem to get riposted as much as ever. Couple of our other wars have said the same things. Mostly &quot;tested&quot; in PoAir.</div></div><hr />

I haven't fought much anywhere else since the patch, so I won't comment on other areas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nevian</div><div class="date">04-25-2003, 07:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been having my usual cleric watch my health in xp groups with duel wield and 2h.  So far he has noticed minimal damage taken differences in PoV(desert and inner/outer), PoS(mini's included), BoT giants and tactics (both roaming through ogres and pit).  Im inclined to say atleast in tier 2 and 3 it appears to be greatly reduced for duel wield.  haven't parsed it, just what i have noticed.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">04-26-2003, 09:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Riposte rate has been noticably different on mobs in Plane of Disease, Nightmare and Innovation.<br />
<br />
My monk has dual wielded and off tanked some innovation mobs, and survived. In the past the mitigation problems and the ripostes would eat him up in seconds.<br />
<br />
My warrior has dual wielded and done just fine in the other two tier 1 zones I've been in since the patch.<br />
<br />
So tier 1, I've noticed things have changed.<br />
<br />
Plus they don't enrage anymore, which is nice.</div></div><hr />

But if ya say that your all getting riposted less, I say ...........................         ROCK!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Choppin</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 03:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm going to say that they have not reduced riposte rates in PoP (at least on bosses) and I will stand by that until anyone proves different.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomb</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 04:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is quite a difference from when i started in PoV/S and BoT to today.<br />
But hard to prove as there are 4 levels and almost 70 AA difference since then to what caused this.<br />
I only can say i seem to take a lot less ripostes now than back then.<br />
But with maxed avoidance (CA3/LR5) it should be that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zaos13</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 04:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">riposte is insanely gay for exp groups. i went back to primal/epic 2hander cause CHSD and red epic put more riposte dmg on me than the monster would normally dish out alone. this is patheticly lame....<br />
<br />
i almost died in a PoS giant group with a 1handers cause i got 3 ripostes in a row, NOT NICE</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaldanm</div><div class="date">04-29-2003, 07:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">SOE should do that riposte activate only on main hand attack, depending on a ratio rate specific to the mob, not on the weapon delay (just like proc rate per minutes does not increase if you're hasted)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cily</div><div class="date">04-30-2003, 10:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Only problem with regulating riposte rates is once you do, you might as well remove the ability entirely because it no longer serves a function.<br />
<br />
The big bad named guys make good use of it, making any fight rely on at least a little luck. The problem is with XP mobs really.<br />
<br />
Too bad they didn't make Tactical Mastery a useful tool for limiting the impact riposte had on you. Could have been nice.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lens314</div><div class="date">04-30-2003, 04:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They have not removed enrage from all mobs in PoN, hobgoblins and the gloom nightmare still enrage, found out the hard way...almost! :D  But in my PoS/PoV hutning which I do more of than PoN/PoD/PoI, im so glad they dont anymore.</div></div><hr />
