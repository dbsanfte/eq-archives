<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aabe88</div><div class="date">04-21-2003, 02:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am a L45 Warrior, fairly well-equiped (about 2300 hps).  I have SCHW for haste (if Swiftblade not equipped), a Wurmslayer in Main hand, and the following weapons for choices off-hand:<br />
Velium Swiftblade<br />
Centi Longsword<br />
Slarlungh Spear (sp?)<br />
Bloodpoint (I don't think it procs yet)<br />
Centi Warhammer<br />
<br />
What are your suggestions?  A friend said to stick with the Wurmy/Swifty combo.  What do you all think?<br />
<br />
If necessary, I have about 5k to upgrade.  Thanks for your help.  My link below.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">04-21-2003, 03:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">you're just about the right level to put that wurmslayer away ( tell ya why in a minute ) and find yourself some decent  1H weapons that are a bit faster.<br />
<br />
Back when we had the Wurmslayer discussions; most people decided that in the mid to upper 40's the damage bonus on most 1H weapons actually caught up; if not surpassed; the wurmslayers dps and having the faster weapons there with more hitting going on proved the most beneficial.<br />
<br />
probabally one of the most decent 1H weapons hat are reasonably priced and can give you the most &quot; bang for yer buck&quot; are :<br />
<br />
1. Bed Leg Club ( basically a warr only lammy blunt clone; the +magic bonus is nice ) - price: dirt cheap well, on terris they sell for 100pp~ and i think they're primary hand only; but you can move your primary hand weapon to offhand if you think it'll be more beneficial<br />
2. Guard Captain Mallet - really nice offhander and even a decent mainhander if you don't own a less than 20 delay weapon. I used one right up to my epics for pure DPS.<br />
3. Jagged Blade of Mourning - another very nice offhander in the 1K~ price; nice MR and dex and AC. ratio is good too for an offhander<br />
4. name Velium weapon - these are the weapons from Dragon Necropolis...most are of a 1:2 ratio if not better...consider though as the ratio gets better the price goes up..see paying 500pp - p for one of the graded velium weapons.<br />
5. For Aggro specifically and not much else...Black Blade of Tormenting is a solid weapon for situations where you need cheap aggro and can't afford the frostbringer yet...or if you're a good race or have seru faction do the Praetor Blade of Debility quest....guaran-damn-tee you for a free weapon that takes longer to run between zones than to complete you won't find a better weapon ( stat wise it blows but the proc is devastating )..until my epics I MT'd mobs from Black Golems in CoM up to Dozekar/HoT nameds/ Lend/Telk/Derakor/KT/Dain/Inny/PoG named trees with them and they performed exceptionally for the relative cost/time they took to obtain and were only replaced by my Epics.<br />
<br />
IMO though the velium swiftblade you're a bit too old for; sure they're nice for the haste but I feel you're losing too much DPS for it to pay off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smakz</div><div class="date">04-21-2003, 04:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Keep the Centi Longsword.  Sell the rest of the junk, buy a frostbringer.  Mainhand Frosty, Offhand CLS<br />
<br />
those should hold you till mid 50s easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aabe88</div><div class="date">04-21-2003, 04:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, but if I sell off all the other weapons, what about skilling up in Piercing and 1HB?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Friedrick</div><div class="date">04-21-2003, 04:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What Smakz said except I would keep the bloodpoint though for piercing and situational use (farming greens with the lifetap and piercing raises) and sell the Centi LS.  The rest you can say good bye to now.  If you can swing it, I would try to pick up a Frostbringer and a Guard Captains Mallet by using what you have saved and selling the rest.  If not, shoot for Frostbringer and Bedleg Club.  This will allow you to keep 1hb skill going up.  The Centi Longsword is a decent weapon for offhander and situationally a decent DPS weapon mainhand at your level but the Guard Captain's Mallet has a better ratio and faster.  This should mean better DPS and aggro.<br />
<br />
I am not personally convinced that your Wurmslayer has run out of usefulness but there are many people who percieve that it has.  This I think will hurt you getting groups.  Too many people think that a Lammy is better for a lvl 20 warrior than a Wurmslayer /shrug.  Not trying to start an arguement though :)<br />
<br />
Anyway, Frostbringer and Guard Captains Mallet are solid aggro, dps weapons for your level and many to come.  Much better than many of us had at that level.<br />

<br />
Naah, actually i should have emphasized it more in my post; but the wurmy is a solid weapon for any fledgling warrior up to around level 45 or so; after that your damage bonus for the faster weapons actually adds more DPS....but less that 40th+ level all the way down to level 14 or so the Wurmslayer is a top dog weapon for the price.</div></div><hr />

<br />
look for a cheep improved damage 2/3 item till you go for hp gear the extra dammage from it's alitle agro. if the proc is a dot look for the extended afliction one. look up the lvl of he proc to see what you need. they also boost boon/tricksters procs</div></div><hr />

<br />
Or is my comprehension that pathetic =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aabe88</div><div class="date">04-22-2003, 10:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bought a Bed Leg Club, 50pp.  I thought that was a great deal, next cheapest in bazaar was 100pp, as advertised.<br />
<br />
Guard Captain's Mallet was 4k.  I didn't buy *YET*.<br />
<br />
NO Frostbringer for sale, AND it might be a bit pricey for me atm.<br />
<br />
BUT, on another note, DING, Welcome to level 46! :)<br />
So I got to equip my Nightmarewood Compound Bow, though I do not posses the willpower *yet* for the proc!  woot and :(<br />
<br />
Also, Bloodpoint would not proc at 46.  Anyone know what level it does?<br />
<br />
Thanks again all for your helpful information. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gaylon</div><div class="date">04-22-2003, 12:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If i recall correctly, Bloodpoint proced at level 50.  I still have fond memories of DW Bloodpoints. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">04-22-2003, 01:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">than offhand that centi longsword and keep at them levels....you're still getting anice chunk of hit points off of it and the ratio is great as an offhander...keep saving the coins and look into a frosty soon i'd go with since oce you're into your 50's you're going to be better off with an aggro weapon with the proc..DPS+Aggro becomes a whole 'nother game when you really start progressing towards MT-related fighting when you become the MT.<br />
<br />
Grats on 46 too !!  Good Luck and Good Hunting !!</div></div><hr />

<br />
and as a testimant to the power of the praetor's blade, one proc of that baby can hold taunt off of a lvl 57 shammy's slow, at lvl 50, and a second proc will allow that shammy to sit down, tried and proven several times in PoJ doing the exit duo, its incredibly nice for its ease, anyone know what lvl it procs? im thinking about making a lil warrior alt project</div></div><hr />

And i still use my willsapper when dualboxing in PoS or CoD with my cleric.<br />
But getting a willsapper is another story, back then it was a 3 to 4 group effort to get to Vaniki in DN, not to mention he is on a 3 day spawn timer (never kept timer, just tracked if he was up).</div></div><hr />

If you can ever get the bastage to proc *smirks* .. I only just sold mine, cos I haven't dual-wielded in longer than I can remember<br />
<br />
I'm with Shik. Wurmy good up to 45. I dumped mine at 49 for a Lammy hehe. Got a frosty at 55 and used it all the way up.. Well, I only stopped using when I stopped dual wielding in Tier 2 and went to 2-hand epic.</div></div><hr />

I'd be interested in seeing logs if this is true.  I had thought it wasn't, but I could be wrong.</div></div><hr />

Piercing... /ignore<br />
<br />
Blunt, i would keep a crap blunt weap to keep it maxed, just toss in yer main hand for a few fights or raids per level to keep it maxed. There are some nice blunt weaps u may see later on in game.. (PoI  weap, Blackout off HP in SSra, etc...) as for peircing?... its useless.<br />
