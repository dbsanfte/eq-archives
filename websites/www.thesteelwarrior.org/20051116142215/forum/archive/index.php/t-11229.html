<br />
1-mid 50's is 90% solo, and some very light grouping for quests. Some, but not a lot of time in instances. <br />
<br />
Mid 50s to 60. Slightlly more serious grouping as far fewer quests are soloable. Some &quot;raiding.&quot; Of course raiding in WOW is easy mode. So far for me it has involved what are technically 1 group instances with 2 groups. Basically is farming for gear as the instance quests aren't completeable with a raid.<br />
<br />
The next step is having geared up (at least some) in the instances--say some Valor gear--you do the isntances you have been &quot;raiding&quot; as a single group. <br />
<br />
And then the end game--back to raiding. I guess it would consist enterily of MC/Onyxia's Lair. <br />
<br />
Just seems odd that (very broadly) the logical progression is solo-raid-group-raid.</div></div><hr />

Sometimes, I think I'm the only one who reads what I write.  And I even wrote it on your thread!<br />

You know a game is fundamentally flawed when a player can happily and easily level to 60 solo or with a small group of friends of any random class assortment. The game is designed for casual play. Casual players praise the rested state, the fact that they can log on an accomplish something in a matter of minutes, the fact that quests are broken into quickly-completed steps. Even the instances are all completed within 2-3 hours, tops. <br />
<br />
But wait, those casual players reach 60. Here is what they will see. They cannot complete quests at all unless they five-man instances (with the right assortment of classes) some of which that take a solid 2-group raid 3-4 hours; with a five-man it takes minimum 5 hours. They cannot log in and immediately feel a sense of accomplishment because even in solid guilds, which our happy casual players probably do not have, getting the right numbers and classes takes time. <br />
<br />
We are looking at two radically different games. And unlike EverQuest, where at least players sort of learned the score as they leveled, here the &quot;end game&quot; will come as a complete surprise.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have no idea where you get the concept that the progression goes from solo to raid to group to raid.  Where exactly in the 50-60s do you raid aside from &quot;final&quot; instances (BRS/Strat/Scholo/MC/Ony)?  I would hazard a guess that &quot;gearing up&quot; in those instances never ever ever involves single groups.  You don't single group, for instance, BRS unless you need quests finished - and you'd do that before you gear up.  In any event, if that's been your progression, so be it.  I don't think that's the typical experience.  I think its solo/group ---&gt; raid  with absolutely no inbetween.  Which is the problem that serious players have been bitching about since beta.  The game simply doesn't teach people how to be useful or efficient in a group/raid so by the time we get to level 60 and we have to group ... some of us end up with real fucking wacko losers in our parties with zero etiquette or skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">04-07-2005, 07:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">*blush* actually I usually do read what you say--and know you are usually in agreement with me. Don't know why that one didn't register. Please don't beat me :-p. That said the topic focus is quite different in that thread.<br />
<br />
Having sat out for 6 weeks or something like that I find it much easier to find raids going into any of the end game instances with a group. So far I think I don't really have any of the end game in instance quests done. <br />
<br />
Why slog though any of the end game instances in no better than fair gear, and new to the zone rather than getting to know the zone and not having a solid understanding of your class's role in groups.<br />
<br />
Right now I have 1 piece of Valor, and 2 of the plate set from Scholo (and about 400 more AC from Milli's Shield). I also have 12-15 dungon quests. Also since raids, at least on Kargath, are the norm, you can hit Scholo, Strath, etc at a lower level as you are not on nearly as tight a budget. <br />
<br />
So yes I do see the typical advancement going in multi-group raids into instances, getting geared up and then completing the quests.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I tend to agree it's more solo &gt; group &gt; small raid &gt; Max cap raid for doing content though, which kinda sucks.  You really end up with a lot of nimrods who as stated are clueless because there is no requirements to actually learn anything.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not exactly! If you are not experienced player coming over with a guild or friends progression is more like this:<br />
<br />
solo &gt; solo with four others &gt; solo with 9-14 others &gt; solo with 39 others and complain how hard MC/Onyxia/Kazzak/Azuregos is and blame everyone else.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't find it that sad.  I have friends who have done Scholo 30 times without getting their hat (Also know one crazy-ass paladin who did BRD 40+ times to get his pally gloves before he just gave up and made do with Valor like every other paladin).  I have done Scholo about 15 times and have yet to get my hat and I know I'll keep going until I get it. <br />
<br />
Frankly, I'm more than happy to slog through this shit and waste most of waking day a couple times with a single group.  It's fun and challenging the first couple times. But I think its fucking insane to expect players to put away 4+ hours with a single group 30+ times to get a single peice of gear.    That may be &quot;hard core&quot; but it sure as shit isn't the least bit fun by that point.  On my fifteenth Scholo run two days ago I no longer sought a challenge - I just wanted my goddamn hat.  :p <br />
<br />
For the most part, I think the folks bringing this issue up were too tied to the EQ model of misery (Not necessarily that you are, Greysen, but that's my impression from reading the main forums).  I think Blizzard struck a pretty good compromise requiring folks to single-group this content in order to complete quests but allowing them to raid when it comes to going through it umpteen million times for gear.  Plus, for lots of people, myself included, this will be the only &quot;raiding&quot; they do in game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If ya want to talk about progression issues...<br />
<br />
How do they expect guilds to jump from 15 man raids to 40?  This game desperately needs a 25 man raid zone.  I thought someone said that the next instance &quot;Blackwing Lair?&quot; is going to be a mid-size raid zone, but I hope they release it sooner than later.<br />
<br />
It is frustrating to have a slowly growing guild of around 20 active raiders.  Too many for one raid, not enough for two.  Ends up in a lot of frustration when we have to tell guildies that the raid is full.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greysen</div><div class="date">04-08-2005, 03:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, Scholo is the only instance I'll griep about, because there is no real &quot;midpoint&quot; that you can drop into like you can with every single instance.  So single group you're looking at a 4+ hour run every single time.  Thats just poor design.  On top of that, the loot is piss poor for the amount of time you put in, unless you're looking for some very specific pieces.<br />
<br />
Irreguardless, there is no good loot a 5 man group can get that you can't chump out and get with 10 (or more in the past).  I'm not stuck in the model of misery, there is just nothing to differntiate the good from the bad based on equipment (DM has good stuff, but it's spotty.  It's not even really a &quot;hard&quot; instance) .. unless you raid onyx/core + instances.<br />
<br />
I'll be real happy if they keep the new strath/scholo+ instances straight 5 man.   This will be an excellent way to distinguish the crap from the cream.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Strath/scholo should be lowered to 5 man caps.<br />
<br />
Blackrock Spire should be lowered to a 10 man cap. (I only wish lower could be made a 5 man cap without effecting upper, but alas!)<br />
<br />
Dire Maul is so easy it scares me. It's a good progressions from Black Rock depths, and leads into Strath/scholo.<br />
<br />
After that they just need more content!<br />
<br />
Impliment 1 more 10 man raid zone about Lower BRS in difficulty.<br />
<br />
Impliment a couple 15-25 man raid zones.<br />
<br />
And for the love of god put in some truly difficult 5man zones!</div></div><hr />

<br />
really the best would be to split LBRS and UBRS into two instances. LBRS cap of 5, UBRS cap of 15, and move the ogre event to UBRS. you could tweak it even further; everything through Rend is possible with 5-10 people.</div></div><hr />

<br />
People use to scream baron was impossible to 1-group, but he's so trivial with 5 now, kind of silly really.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, but just getting gear from the earlier bosses in the zone would give you the dps, or from the 5 man zones like strath/scholo. To me that's pretty logical progression, why I'd rather see him a fard fight for 10, then a trivial 1 for 15, would make the content last longer ;)</div></div><hr />
