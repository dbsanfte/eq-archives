The current client can be downloaded at fileplanet. Stress testers will have a reserved position available for open beta when it starts. See the WoW site for the official announcment.</div></div><hr />

I got like 3 friends that tried it before I got home from school.  They all said its just like going in a circle... none of them can DL any thing.  They just keep getting to this place saying they have to sing up for fileplanet, which they already have done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lorre</div><div class="date">11-02-2004, 08:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">They are totally bogged down.  Also they are charging to DL and signup for the free Blizzard Beta Stress test.  It took me around 3-4 hours to be able to even sign up for the thing, all the servers were slow.  I called in to customer service and their message was that it will eventually get to you.</div></div><hr />

I bought the 3-month FP subscription when the first stress test came out back in August.  My membership was still active so I was able to just log right on and start downloading the game.<br />
<br />
Granted, it took 14 hours to download the whole thing.   :eek: <br />
<br />
But ... I was finally able to install the game and get logged in and create my first character this morning ... right before I had to come to work.   :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
You should be able to pay for one month (that is 7.90).  Not sure it's worth it since open beta is likely to begin quite soon anyway...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">11-02-2004, 11:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">strees test is planned to be between 5 and 7 days long. so if you don't already have your FP account the time you've already loose plus the time to get your account on the overwhelned account server plus the time to download the game you will just have two-three days for stresstest.... <br />
<br />
smells good!<br />
 want a cookie?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lorre</div><div class="date">11-02-2004, 01:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its $7.90 to start playing this week.  My bro and I signed up but he did it 4 hours before me.  He got his Key last night and is already lvl 3 while Im still waiting.<br />
<br />
$7.90 ensures you access to the stress test which will end this week.  But you keep you key and can use it for open beta once that starts up.  Not sure how long open beta is, but it should be worth $7.90 for early access.  I think the 1st month of retail is free anyways right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikken</div><div class="date">11-03-2004, 12:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, no. You bought the game. The activation subscription is included. So, the first month is included, not free.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nazgrub</div><div class="date">11-03-2004, 12:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As a side note, I signed up for the stress test at 10:30 p.m. on Monday night, didn't get my email until 6 p.m. on Tuesday, ugh.</div></div><hr />
