<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rasma</div><div class="date">10-28-2004, 01:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My wife was just in the BB wayfarer camp, and was attacked by a skeletal footsoldier, and a skeletal conscript. I tried allakhazam, and they were not in the database anywhere, even after searching for thier names, and partial names. Both died easiliy to her enchanter pet, and her enchanter is only level 30. Dropped bone chips, nothing else, and no coin. Just wondering if this is new, or old, or what, since I did not see an announcement anywhere on everquest.com, or in thier forums about this coming out. This was on Stromm btw, if that makes any difference. Anyway, thanks for any ideas, and hopefully I am not making a fool of myself for something that has been in for years :P</div></div><hr />

In true SoE fashion the itemization seems exactly the same as the 5th anniversary.  I was kinda hoping for something new for my twinks.</div></div><hr />

Wouldn't put it past sony to just add all the same stuff as before  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crathsor Gnawbones</div><div class="date">10-28-2004, 04:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Only Halloween event I remember is the werewolf attack in West Commonlands.  Had to be at least a dozen running around killing people.<br />
<br />
Once we heard about the skele's some people went back to Lower Guk, alas no Fabled wandering about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redleaf</div><div class="date">10-28-2004, 05:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I still remember the First Halloween event.  Kithicor went from a nice place to hunt to death on two legs. =P<br />

i remember that one... haha  :D <br />
<br />
so many corpses at LR zone  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kellaen</div><div class="date">10-29-2004, 04:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">They're nothing more then newbie raping mobs that drop total shit for loot of proper level in todays game. Don't see why they even bother doing this unless scaring newbies away is a fun thing to do on halloween.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">10-29-2004, 07:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah, i'd love to leave some corpses at LR zone-in again.....besides the first GM event I ever attended ( Mayong Mistmoore chalenging Vox in her lair ) .. the LR Halloween GM event was thee most hands-down bestest ever deathfest I ever encountered in a game.<br />
<br />
Who even cared about teh lewt. I was too busy trying to just survive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Senthiele</div><div class="date">10-29-2004, 10:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I imagine this is something of a halloween event.  I also would like to see them turn on some of the older stuff, at least for the weekend!<br />
<br />
Of course, I am also aware, that whatever they are planning for or have, it's probably already turned on and will have to be scripted.  After all, most of Sony is in New orleans for fan faire.  So i'm really not expecting too much to be honest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hittachi</div><div class="date">10-29-2004, 09:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only item worth it for twinks are the bows that they drop. Can't find a good bow in baz without a req/rec level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maghe</div><div class="date">10-30-2004, 12:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So nothing worth bothering with I take it?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">11-01-2004, 07:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well, i got owned 7 times at this GM event ( i thought i'd die more but now with jboots i can outrun them bad guys! ); although i did take a commander down and got....sh*t.<br />
