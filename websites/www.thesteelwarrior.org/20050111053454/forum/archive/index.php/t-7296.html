<br />
I'm drooling with all the discoveries AO &amp; Talisman &amp; DH &amp; the others are making.<br />
But most importantly i am wondering if anyone has any idea (or some parses)<br />
that try to analyse worn effects.<br />
<br />
I know its very early but with some luck these might prove usefull ....<br />

Do you think it is a raw increase ? Or some shitty effect like +8% Dodge.<br />
<br />
Because +16% Parry could be nice. Its almost an entire point gained<br />
(Assuming We parry 5% of attacks , +16% of that is , 0.8% point so 5.8%)<br />
<br />
It probably should be unparsable exept maybe for the dual attack one.<br />
<br />
Thanks :)</div></div><hr />

That's my assumption, but it's just that - an assumption.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mighty Strike Discipline  <br />
Slot Description <br />
1:  Chance to Critical Hit(10000) <br />
 <br />
Indicates they use a 1-10000 scale for chance to crit, 10000 being 100%<br />
<br />
Cleave I  <br />
Slot Description <br />
1:  Chance to Critical Hit(20) <br />
2:  Chance to Critical Hit(20) <br />
3:  Chance to Critical Hit(20) <br />
4:  Chance to Critical Hit(20) <br />
5:  Chance to Critical Hit(20) <br />
6:  Chance to Critical Hit(20) <br />
7:  Chance to Critical Hit(20) <br />
8:  Chance to Critical Hit(20) <br />
9:  Chance to Critical Hit(20) <br />
10:  Chance to Critical Hit(20) <br />
11:  Chance to Critical Hit(20) <br />
 <br />
As I understand it, those repeated values are meant as blockers rather than additions, hence per 10000 hits, 20 of them will crit as a result of the bracer, or you will crit on 0.2% of melee hits as a direct result of this bracer, but this DOESN'T stack with crit enhancing discs such as the rogue disc: Twisted Chance.<br />
<br />
The direct % ones listed above however are direct reported %s, so I'm guessing your above assumption is correct.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'd like to see some parses, but we (DH) don't have any yet to parse ourselves, since the day after we reached Qvic they changed the Qvic armor mobs from 1 hour respawning single group mobs to 6 hour respawning small raid mobs, changed the Inktu'ta instance farming by adding a 2 hour lockout, and moved all the loot from the zone-in namer to the final boss heh. Such is life.</div></div><hr />

That earring is nice though, it didnt drop off Norqfield for us, we got Muramite BP + 2 conservation necklaces and a earring with no stats but good HP and ac.</div></div><hr />

I suspect Phantron is correct. The SK discipline Leechcurse includes a +100% to hit bonus, and while we still miss under /disc, it's a -very- noticable effect overall. All in all, it takes me from roughly a 50% hit / miss ratio to close to a 95% hit - miss ratio. With various debuffs / modifiers, I think they were simply still attemping to guarantee the crit/dodge/riposte on the various pure melee /disciplines.</div></div><hr />
