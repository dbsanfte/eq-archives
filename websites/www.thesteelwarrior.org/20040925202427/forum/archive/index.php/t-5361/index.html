<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gromlok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My guild, Pak'cafan on Tarew Mar, has been blocked from raiding PoTime for three weeks now because of the &quot;instancing bug&quot;.  SoE refuses to give us any help besides saying &quot;wait 5 days and try again&quot;.  We have done that three times, enough is enough.  Now we are losing members, they are quitting the game - canceling all accounts.<br />
<br />
Here is a log of our latest round of ineptitude:<br />
<br />
Keep in mind, this is after the escalation to the GM, which was a few hours of Guide talks, that i will post later/tomorrow: <br />
<br />
[Fri Jan 23 22:59:52 2004] Vaylin tells you, 'Greetings, I am GM Vaylin. I understand you are having trouble with the plane of time and instance issues. Unfortunately we are aware of this issue as you are also not the only guild having this problem. We can not help you with this issue as there is no ability GMs have to fix this. I ask that all those effected leave the zone for 5 days and do not come back as doing so will further this problem for you. I also ask that you /bug this matter with full details.' <br />
<br />
[Fri Jan 23 23:00:15 2004] Vaylin tells you, 'There is nothing we can do for you on this. I do apologize to you.' <br />
<br />
[Fri Jan 23 23:00:48 2004] You told Vaylin, 'Thank you for responding, but can I ask how 'staying out of the zone for 5 days', when we have done that for 3 weeks going on 4 now, and in fact, stayed out for 9 days last week is going to be different this time ?' <br />
<br />
[Fri Jan 23 23:01:43 2004] Vaylin tells you, 'It may not do anything however if it doesnt work then sadly nothings changed however if it does work then at least you can use the zone.' <br />
<br />
[Fri Jan 23 23:01:49 2004] Greang tells you, 'You are the leader of the guild correct?' <br />
<br />
[Fri Jan 23 23:01:50 2004] You told Vaylin, 'Can i also ask why the zone has been reset for other guilds on this and other servers who were not blocked from the zone for 22 days as we have been ?' <br />
<br />
[Fri Jan 23 23:02:17 2004] Vaylin tells you, 'No ones reset that zone. I'm sorry who ever gave you that information is misinformed.' <br />
<br />
[Fri Jan 23 23:03:00 2004] You told Vaylin, 'and because I dont want to push that issue.. its not about 'fairness'... its about not cancelling our accounts, can I ask that I have the email or name of someone who is your supervisor so I can explain the dire nature of the situation and possibly give you more power to correct it ?' <br />
<br />
[Fri Jan 23 23:03:30 2004] Vaylin tells you, 'The only resets that have been done on that zone have been due to them taking it down to attempt to fix this issue. We do not offer any customer service except the basic assistance in plane of time as developement has has asked us not to.' <br />
<br />
[Fri Jan 23 23:03:32 2004] You told Vaylin, 'please Vaylin... we have been locked out of Time for 22 days.. do you think we don't know when an instance is reset by this point on our server, or that we are unaware of Drinal server time reset last night ?' <br />
[Fri Jan 23 23:03:55 2004] Vaylin tells you, 'I'm sorry but theres nothing we can do to help you with it' <br />
<br />
[Fri Jan 23 23:04:47 2004] You told Vaylin, 'Ok, I can accept that answer.... I am sorry for implying anything shady.. but I would like to have a contact of your superior so that I can enforce how big an issue this is for our guild. We are on the virge of loising 80+ accounts and a guild i have been in since day 1 of EQ' <br />
<br />
[Fri Jan 23 23:05:11 2004] Vaylin tells you, 'You can email eqcs@soe.sony.com however please be aware they will not reset the zone for you.' <br />
<br />
[Fri Jan 23 23:05:37 2004] You told Vaylin, 'I dont even want a reset anymore, I want someone to know why a guild and 80+ accounts cancel their subscriptions' <br />
<br />
[Fri Jan 23 23:06:22 2004] Vaylin tells you, 'Then contacting my supervisor or any GM supervisor is not the correct course of action. As this is a developement side bug you need to voice your concerns about this zone not working to development.' <br />
<br />
[Fri Jan 23 23:06:23 2004] You told Vaylin, 'i want a guarantee that something is done on Sunday after 4 weeks of being told to 'wait 5 days'.. I dont think that is unreasonable, and I dont think it is impossible or unprecedented that the 'bug fixes' be attempted for the guild who has endured it the longest' <br />
<br />
[Fri Jan 23 23:08:46 2004] You told Vaylin, 'I just don't know what to do anymore... I want answers more then anything, I dont want special treatment, I've never asked for it before. We've been so good with this.. we've stayed out of the zone.. we've allowed the server time rotation to continue even though we have been blocked. It is monumentally important and I guess we need more communication on the issue then 'go ahead and try in 5 days and be disappointed again'.' <br />
<br />
[Fri Jan 23 23:09:39 2004] Vaylin tells you, 'I'm sorry you dont like the answer I've given however its the only answer we can give you. As I said you want the correct people to know how you feel about the problem in time let developement know. You can reach them by going to everquestlive.com and posting on the fourms there, doing /feedback in game, or emailing eqfeedback@soe.sony.com. All I can do is tell you I understand your situation your not the only one going through it. We sadly can not help you.' <br />
<br />
[Fri Jan 23 23:10:42 2004] You told Vaylin, 'And, sadly, as much as I'd like to really be irate with you, I believe you... However, I am deeply saddened at what is about to happen with my guild, and I just can't express the anger of this guild disbanding and cancelling in words, really.' <br />
<br />
[Fri Jan 23 23:11:22 2004] You told Vaylin, 'I fear what will happen, and I fear the crap you may have to put up with with 80+ people at their wit's end, because it is likely to come through the petition queue and be a pain that maybe you don't deserve.' <br />
<br />
[Fri Jan 23 23:12:54 2004] Vaylin tells you, 'I totaly understand you and know how annoying this is. I've spoken to many people about this I do know their working on the matter and this week alone have attempted to fix the matter at least three different nights. Let developement know thats the best I can say.' <br />
<br />
[Fri Jan 23 23:13:51 2004] You told Vaylin, 'I would love it if a simple status could be relayed to me or one of my officers, either via email or via game as they work.. it would help me to keep my people in order and to help me in keeping them from cancelling.. is that even a possibility ?' <br />
<br />
[Fri Jan 23 23:14:33 2004] You told Vaylin, 'Something I could use to keep them from going crazy, official word, something.. if i say 'wait 5 days and we will retry' one more time, they are going to lynch me' <br />
<br />
[Fri Jan 23 23:14:59 2004] Vaylin tells you, 'I'm sorry that wont be able to happen. I can tell you game masters are very busy as most of us are currently covering two to three servers.' <br />
<br />
[Fri Jan 23 23:16:19 2004] You told Vaylin, 'You have to forgive me then if I say that is completely and totally unacceptable that noone can even communicate to a guild who has been bugged and blocked from enjoying a game they pay for for almost an entire billing cycle of 1 month.' <br />
<br />
[Fri Jan 23 23:17:25 2004] You told Vaylin, 'I can understand if you tell me you can't reset the zone.. but I absolutely demand communication on what is being done... absolutely demand it.. and whether or not that matters to you, I absolutely know something as simple as a status report is not unreasonable and something that, frankly, I cannot accept.' <br />
<br />
[Fri Jan 23 23:17:45 2004] Vaylin tells you, 'I understand your feeling here best I can say is check the offical website.' <br />
<br />
[Fri Jan 23 23:18:06 2004] Vaylin tells you, 'there will also more than likely be a patch message as well when they fix the problem.' <br />
<br />
[Fri Jan 23 23:20:33 2004] You told Vaylin, 'Nothing I say at this point really matters, but im deeply saddened that you would take the position that you won't communicate a status report to us and lose, conservatively, 30 accounts and possibly up to 80 and a PR storm as well... It seems ludicrous to me.' <br />
<br />
[Fri Jan 23 23:24:06 2004] Vaylin tells you, 'I'm sorry that you feel that you are not happy with us contacting you personally on this matter. However we just do not have the man power to contact ever time enabled guild personaly about the status of this bug. As I personally have three servers that I do look over. The only thing we can do and that is up to developement again is post something on our web page and or patch message.' <br />
<br />
[Fri Jan 23 23:25:29 2004] You told Vaylin, 'I think you do, at least, owe at least a status to the guild across all servers who has been bugged the longest.. .maybe working with people on Drinal is better for the dev team, and as a programmer, I wont say it isn't.. but you do owe the guild who has the longest time blocked from the zone at least something.. can let us handle the communication from there if ya like.' <br />
<br />
[Fri Jan 23 23:28:10 2004] Vaylin tells you, 'Again I am sorry thta you are not happy with the whole situation. However as I said you'll need to contact the developement team on any dissatisfaction with how the fixing of this zone is going. As for communication the best we can do for you is to ask that you check the offical website and patch messages. I am again sorry and I do hope you have a better night.' <br />
<br />
[Fri Jan 23 23:29:59 2004] Vaylin is not online at this time. <br />
[Fri Jan 23 23:30:12 2004] Players in EverQuest: <br />
[Fri Jan 23 23:30:12 2004] --------------------------- <br />
<br />
[Fri Jan 23 23:30:12 2004] There are no players in EverQuest that match those who filters.<br />
<br />
EQ customer service has always been pretty bad but now they have reached an all time low.  Many people that have been playing this game since beta will now be leaving it for good, who can blame them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gurgeh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I completely agree and I do sympathize, for having suffered the same problem for 2 weeks. CS is at best useless on raid issues, at worse irritating to the point of just quitting the damn game right after getting one in tell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>TaiilChayser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Jeez I know you guys feel hosed and all but whats with the message board jiahd.. I've seen this on every board I frequent.<br />
<br />
Hosed PoTime instances suck, but Server drama is teh suk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Binnamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It's just like the warrior stand down. Trying to get their voices heard, because frankly that shit sucks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gromlok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It's not drama, we are shouting from the roof tops about this now.  The SoE customer service has screwed us for three weeks and we are sick of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">How exactly has SOE customer service screwed you?  I'll readily admit they have a lot of problems in the CS department, but I don't see anything wrong here.  They've told you they are trying to fix it immediately, what more do you want?  This jihad is simply drama, as there is no possible way to please you, which is evident by the fact that you've been told what is happening as much as the GM can tell you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Benlin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I would agree with you Hussar, if it was a case of the first time they went into plane of time, seems to be a period of a Month but....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well, the problem is that they really can't do much about it. It's not a CS problem, it's a bug. If it's a known bug, all they can tell you is &quot;Sorry, we're working on it&quot; which is exactly what happened. That's one shitty bug, but it's not the CS's fault. What did you want them to do? You even said the only possible thing they could do, which was resetting the zone, wouldn't be enough now. I'm not disagreeing with canceling accounts over the bug, but that was as good as customer service gets. Place the blame with the people that didn't fix the bug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gromlok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Guys... get off your drama kick, not interested.  All that we have asked for from CS is communication.<br />
<br />
Week 1: Instance bug appears for our guild.  We are told to &quot;go play alts&quot; until fixed.  Nice.  We stay out of PoTime for 5 days as suggested by another guild that has already had this issue fixed for them.<br />
<br />
Week 2: We are told to stay out of PoTime for 5 more days when bug persists.  Nothing more is said to us, no emails are answered, no communication from the dev team.<br />
<br />
Week 3: Still bugged.  We are told to stay out of time for 5 days.... broken record.  This time we stay out for NINE days straight.  Still bugged so we get the above conversation.<br />
<br />
This issue has been fixed on other servers for other guilds, all we ask is the same.  Developers have contacted guild leaders for others that were affected to try and hash it out, all we ask is the same.  One of our officers has emailed CS and the Dev team every week and heard nothing..... nothing at all.  I don't think we are asking too much.<br />
<br />
Those looking for drama go elsewhere.  We are simply tired of trying to use all of the proper channels to get this handled so now we are screaming it to the void that is the internet.  Not gonna help you say?  Fine, makes us feel better to vent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gromlok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Oh, one more thing.  It's not the inability to raid PoTime that has caused two officers and half a dozen members to cancel all EQ accounts.  It is the lack of interest SoE has shown to make this right.  It can be fixed, it has been fixed for others.  They just have not shown a desire to help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Timmok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I for one dont blame you for trying to generate some publicity on this issue, its been going on long enough on several servers and they need to fix it.<br />
<br />
I dont think anyone not in a time guild can fully understand how damn boring EQ would be if the one and only zone that have any worthwhile stuff in it is unavailable. <br />
<br />
For many guilds PoTime is the only raid of the week, because LDON simply isnt worth wasting time on and they dont need more rotting EP junk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Morticea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Sony Customer Service <br />
<br />
Sony....<br />
<br />
Customer Service....<br />
<br />
/e shakes head<br />
<br />
Sorry, those three words in one statement do not go together.<br />
<br />
I doubt the word 'Customer' is in SoE's vocabulary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I'd bet on it.<br />
<br />
To them:<br />
<br />
Customer = $$$$$$$$$$$$</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">afaik what they need to do to fix it is bring down time specifically (patch the zone on server)... this resets spawns and i guess instancing (i'd think that instance stuff would be stored by char but maybe its on zone file?)<br />
<br />
we were having this problem on drinal, on the patch of the 22nd or 23rd, when we logged in mobs in timeA were untargetable (which menas quarm hasnt been killed, aka reset)...<br />
<br />
so far my guild has done half of time and another has cleared it and works fine, tommorow we go back will update if we get our own instance back...<br />
<br />
while it might not be as simple as just reseting the zone, what stinks most about soe CS is the absolute refersal to talk to the customrer base, GM afer GM would say probably scriped things but couldnt do shit...<br />
<br />
if they say hey there is a problem with time, we dont know how to fix it (i think they do cause they seemed to do it here, but thats not point) we're working on it or something....<br />
<br />
my guess is they want to find out  what caused it so they are testing different servers with different approachs to see what works best and what caused it....<br />
<br />
saying that or whatever is up amd refunding a month for players affected wouldnt hurt bottom line much at all and would buy them good needed crediability at least imo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Frax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">As it turns out our 'fix' was something we were partially able to correct ourselves, but there *was* a bug of somesort where some people were in the incorrect instance, if this is fixed we have no idea.  A Gm/Guide couldn't even explain the procedures on what the messages mean when you zone into potimeb, our officers had a discussion with the other 2 time guilds on our server and learned (IMO, i'm not an officer) a key bit of info we didnt know before about how to tell if your instance is 'respawned' or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Lauthar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Now I hate to be a bugbear but I would just like to add something in SOE's CS's defence.<br />
<br />
Having worked on a customer support line for a fair while, customers always seem to think that because you happen to work for the company in question you have the absolute authority and power move the heaven and earth for the caller.<br />
<br />
It doesn't work like that, take this case for example, the GM stated early on that he was unable to do anything to alter the situation ' he probably wasn't lying ' giving the poor guy grief over something out of his control doesn't help anyone.<br />
<br />
One of this things you are told if you work for CS is that you never bad mouth the company in any situation, you never achknoledge bugs or problems unles specifically told to do so, and you never agree to let the customer speak to a manager or give out contact details unless abolsutley necessary. GM's are the supervisors of the guides and the chances of it going over a GM is extraordinarily unlikely.<br />
<br />
All you can do in situations is supply as much information as possible in a calm collected e-mail to SOE.<br />
<br />
And you are absolutley right <br />
Customer = $$$$$$$$$$$$<br />
But if $$$$ coming in is &lt; $$$$$$ going out paying wages and expenses then EQ = Shut Down as unfinancially feasable.<br />
<br />
<br />
So make your choice world class CS or get to play EQ for another 2 -3 years.<br />
<br />
just my 2 cents<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Frax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">you are saying SOE cannot afford to have good quality service?</div></div><hr />
