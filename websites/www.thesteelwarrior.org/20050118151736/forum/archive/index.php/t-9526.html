The BF I knoew drops in Ssra.  Do you need a raid to get this or can a good group of Time folks to take the mob down?

You have to hold the other snakes mezzed away from the HP or they do a CH on him.... So it takes numbers, not just uber ppl<br />
<br />
Same for XTC....<br />
<br />
Maybe the cursed could be done with an uber group, but on most servers he is on a rotation, so it has to be a guild thing.<br />
<br />
From Alahkazams<br />
We are mostly timegeared and do him easily with 10-12 people. Semi-Long and very fun fight.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Never really wanted to try HP with a small group, but I've done XTC with 11 characters (3 people), it's just a really, really long fight.  You do need to have a certain number of people, just a group of 6 time flagged people might be pushing it, but at a minimum you wouldn't need much more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">10-26-2004, 05:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cursed cycle drops the BF. And yes, a group could probably take him down though it would be a long fight.</div></div><hr />

Cursed = BF<br />
XTC = Hategiver (though personally I think it's a myth even if I do have a warrior in my guild wielding one)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">10-26-2004, 07:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have done the Cursed script with 13 people total, all of which were elemental (or less) equipped.  You have to realize that, unlike most PoP and even a lot of [early] GoD encounters, Luclin encounters are glorified endurance fights, and when you're fighting these Ssra named with only two groups, they take a long, long, LLOOONNGG time to kill.  The biggest difficulty for us when fighting in the Cursed script was not so much Cursed himself, but actually Exiled.  As most of you know, Exiled death touches, and it requires you to recycle your members, putting extra strain on the already limited resources that you have (rezzing/buffing = resources!).  We beat him, but just about every single one there tanked him.  Tank down?  Paladin tanks.  Paladin down, rogue tanks.  Rogue down, second rogue tanks.  Second rogue dead, fuck... the bard is tanking!  Meanwhile, the second cleric is rezzing up and buffing the fallen, all of which are jumping right back into the battle for a second round of death touches.<br />
<br />
Cursed himself reminds me a lot of fighting Quarm for the first time, where the emphisis isn't really about keeping your tank alive, it's just about keeping your raid alive in general!  In this case with so few people, you can't afford to lose a single one.  <br />
<br />
The fight is doable.  I've done it.  It's pretty hard despite being pretty old content now, but goddamn, it was also some of the most fun I've had in a long time.  It's a refreshing challenge from mobs that assrape you before you can even count to... 1.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">10-26-2004, 08:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are only 2 mobs at XtC that need to be tank mezzed, 1 knight can hold them np. HP has a shitload of mobs in his room, 8 (I think, I'm always fighting HP so don't hang out in the jail area) need to be mezzed/tank mezzed, the rest can banished by a cleric or necro.<br />
<br />
My guild usually kills Exiled before he can get a 2nd DT off after the inital pull (That's less than 120 seconds to kill him). We have about 35 ppl on a raid average, no elemental gear yet.</div></div><hr />
