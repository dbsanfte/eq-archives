<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Trong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, I'm 57 and I have tanked in PoD, PoN, PoI, PoV. Just wondering if my gear is good enough to lvl up, or should I try and get some better gear and which slots do you guys recommend the upgrades in. I do have a few K pp I can spend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dalbe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Level up. Your gear is will last you for along time</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You're definitely on the right track so far with a good mix of AC, Stamina, and overall HP gear.  I would imagine when fully buffed, you're pushing over 6000hp, are you not?  <br />
<br />
You look just fine to continue onto level 60.  Upon achieving level 60, I would do a few things:<br />
<br />
1)  Finish that Dain ring buddy!  That ring should last you until the elemental planes for sure.<br />
<br />
2)  Look to eventually start replacing that Champion gear with Kizrak much like you did with your gauntlets.  I wouldn't focus on getting the Kizrak breastplate to much as the Champion breastplate it's still a mighty fine piece of equipment.  It's expensive stuff, that's for sure, but they're worthwhile upgrades.<br />
<br />
Other than that, I think you're well on your road to warrior stardom.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Trong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">ok, managed to get Kizrak's Battle Helm last night, saves me from changing out my Stone Visor with eyepatch of shadows so I can see at night. You see, us Barb's are blind as bats at night and in dark places.<br />
<br />
As far as HP's, I push 5800 when fully raid buffed, with AC close to 1300 now.<br />
<br />
Working on getting forces required for the 10th Ring.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your advice. I think I'll go and start hunting for groups in PoT and lvl up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kiya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Wrists:  Swap out the PoG and thurgs with Bracers of benevolence, fine heraldic or Kizark's, whichever you can get your hands on first.<br />
Waist:  While aura of battle is nice, I'd ditch the turtle belt for a kylong girdle, putrid belt of rotten hide or a heavy rubi (if you are VERY lucky or have the plat).<br />
Feet:  SS quest boots, vindi boots or kizark's, whichever is obtainable for you first. <br />
<br />
You are in very good shape.  Level to 60 and bang out ND3.  :)</div></div><hr />
