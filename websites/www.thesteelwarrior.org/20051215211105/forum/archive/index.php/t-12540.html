You'll need to go north to that ramp down to the couryard area, jump up on the left edge of and remain aggro free while sneaking over to the door.<br />
<br />
There are 2-3 patrols uptop to watch for, and 1 on the bottom.  Exiting will require a hearthstone.<br />

If you time it right and get good at it, you can dodge all guards along the way. Try this: Enter Dire Maul North, then scout out the area and make sure there are no patrols (dog or ogre) coming. If it looks clear, head towards the down ramp towards the first guard. As you start heading down, you can jump on the left wall of the down ramp, at which point you can jump all the way down to the bottom and bypass any of the immobile groups.  It's an easy trip the library at this point. Just be careful when you jump off the ramp, sometimes a dog patrol roams through that area too. It's not difficult to do this, you just have to know what to look for--maybe try watching patrol patterns if you're &quot;really&quot; wanting to be on the safe side, but I say just go for it. You might take all your armor with Durability off the first time you do it too, because if you get caught you're probably going to die anyways.</div></div><hr />
