Like hell we would.<br />
<br />
There is one problem and that needs to be addressed by solving the problem itself and not by some crappy gimmick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aakla</div><div class="date">09-21-2003, 12:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got 1285 mana so that would be 128 more hp for me, woo hoo hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ealsur Helevorn</div><div class="date">09-21-2003, 02:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Imo, I disagree with that Mana to HP AA, well, not with it but with the % it gives.<br />
<br />
There are several threads stating that the same Plate armor piece has 100hp 100mana and the hybrids benefit more from the stats on them. Then why would we get only 2%-5%-10% mana to hp??? it should be 20%-40%-60% or something along those lines. Its still unfair if you compare 110hp with 100hp 100mana, the 100mana still weights a lot compared to those 10hp.<br />
<br />
I know these AAs came from nowhere, but just felt like giving my opinion :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varalla</div><div class="date">09-22-2003, 12:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Shouldnt be an AA and shouldnt be a percentage.<br />
<br />
Should be automatic for any warrior who dons the item to get a one for one exchange mana to HP.<br />
<br />
Wouldnt be a gimmick, would effect warriors as a whole and not just 65 warriors with 248AA's, wouldnt balance much, but it would solve the all/all armor issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cily</div><div class="date">09-22-2003, 12:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1 to 1 ratio would not only be WAY too powerful, but it would toss itemization even further down the path of broken.<br />
<br />
Your uber 8500 HP unbuffed warrios over night would suddenly have 11K unbuffed, and no one would go after +HP loot anymore. Every warrior is going to compete with mana users on HP/MANA gear and even the Raex set is going to rot. The BP being the only item even close to what wars could achieve if this were implemented.<br />
<br />
There should be some sort of pay off for the wars, but it has to be balanced, and it has to be a much crappier ratio than 1:1<br />
<br />
Heck, if it were 1:1, NToV and Ssra gear would become about 10 times as uber as it is now. heh.<br />

As apposed to Paladins/Rangers/Bst/SKs/Shaman going after HP only gear right at this moment?  Ya, that doesnt happen.  /snicker  Besides, SSRA and beyond almost everything that has HP has Mana.</div></div><hr />
