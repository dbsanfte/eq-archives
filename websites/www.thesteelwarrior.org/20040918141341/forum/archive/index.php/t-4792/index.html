<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Biggwinz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">While is understand the why we have had all the downtime as of late it would be nice to know about it ahead of time when possible.<br />
<br />
You created a nice front page with news and highlights how about throwing up the downtimes that you know are coming a little bit ahead of time!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>sHORTY</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't know when they are coming.. the server had a failing hard drive which was causing hard locks.<br />
<br />
The hard drive was removed and we should be in the clear now, hopefully.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Biggwinz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">np, like i said... for the downtime you know about! It has just sucked to come looking for TSW and find it down with no idea what is going on.<br />
<br />
For example I was browseing the forums the other day and got a mssg that it was going dowin for maitence when trying to read a post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>CasEci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Whelp, since I work peripherally in the IT field I can tell ya, sure it would be nice to be able to schedule un-scheduled downtime, but then again, thats an oxymoron. My boss likes to say SHDWI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Did you guys reset it to like Tuesday?  Seems like a lot of stuff is gone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>sHORTY</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I had to reset it to a backup from Wednesday morning around midnight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rheven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hi.<br />
<br />
It must be hard for you. I saw we were missing some posts and realized you must have been forced to step back to a backup. You have my sympathy for the troubles.<br />
<br />
One thing the system is tearing me up over is this avatar I added for the left margin. I loaded it from my hard drive and it shows in options and also every time I log in but when I make a post I get a pic error. It's really confusing me. I must be doing something stupid.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Oh well, I can't remember what I was bitching about anyway.  Now, why the hell aren't the servers up?  I gotta go find me some tomes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Biggwinz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">You created a nice front page with news and highlights how about throwing up the downtimes that you know are coming a little bit ahead of time! <br />
<br />
I never said, to predict the crashes but when there is a down time comeing like moving to a new server...<br />

*** and that is just an example ***</div></div><hr />
