<br />
I'm a 61 warrior who has fallen in love with his guild, however they're tradeskillers. I have sponsors from some of Bertoxxulous' upper level guilds for when I hit 65, however I'm not planning on taking any of them. My current guild is somewhat new to raiding (like herding chickens, I swear), however myself and a few of the upper-level members are trying to get some easier raids together to outfit some of our members.<br />
<br />
I'm currently planning a small group raid for Kedge Keep this weekend (for my Strength of the Elements quest) and I was wondering if you guys had any suggestions of where else we could raid just to let the guild get farmiliar with how it works.<br />
<br />
Told you that to tell you this:<br />
<br />
As far as my own equipment goes, my plan is to grind out some NRo LDoNs with guild members (they're level 65+ and we'll begin once I'm 65) for the armor available there. Do you guys have any other suggestions on armor? Since upper-level raid mobs are more or less out of the question (we only have about 15 members on at the time ranging from levels 50-70) where can we raid? If possible, include suggestions that don't just yield good warrior gear. I've got a 58 Monk, 58 Bst and 53 Cleric I generally group with.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance. You guys are always a big help.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Athrias</div><div class="date">10-06-2004, 02:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Your guild should easily be able to do the quest for the Loyalist Shield of Honor, which would be an astronomical improvement at this point. Also take a group to Veksar and maybe camp some Kylong Darkmail Gauntlets, as they will yield 3 more AC, 10 more stamina and 45 raw HPs.<br />
<br />
Buyable options that I can think of offhand:<br />
<br />
-Bloodmetal Earring x2 or Bloodmetal Earring/Earring of the Solstice.<br />
-Fierce Heraldic Vambraces, Magnetic Vambraces or Armguards of Repentance<br />
-Despite the loss in Stamina, another Fierce Heraldic Bracer would boost your AC significantly, without much of a loss in resists. <br />
-Blindeye's should be cheap. Good bow with good stats and a pretty nice effect as well.<br />
<br />
Also don't forget tribute. You can get 41% haste, 150HP and 47 AC for around 600 points an hour. That would free up your belt slot for a Fierce Heraldic or Heavy Rubicite Girldle (buyable or campable in Cazic Thule), as well as give you a nice DPS increase which would result in better aggro as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">10-06-2004, 02:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i second the Veksar motion; there's stuff for your other groupmates, the ZEM is good (last time I was there, anyway) and even if you can't use something several of the drops are sellable. Kylong stuff and soulscream belt (31% haste, better AC, STR, STA and hps than your current belt).<br />
I wouldn't mention this because it's not a big/long-lasting upgrade, but you mention sta, so if you have decent Skyshrine faction, I think you could pretty quickly do the draconic spaulder quest. Ac 15, STR 12, STA 12 FR/CR 6. Of course, FH might be a possibility there, too.<br />
And, yeah, LDoNs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">axxeman01</div><div class="date">10-06-2004, 03:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The dragon in POI is also a very good source of decent loot for a new guild.  Fun event as well.  Other mobs similiar to that level include the prototypes, also in POI.  Between these 2 (actually 4, because there are 3 prototypes), you can outfit the tank with a good aggro weapon, and your healers with vastly improved healing all in one stop.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slassh</div><div class="date">10-06-2004, 04:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Start doing some higher end Luclin, working on VT key. I can't imagine these targets being extremely contested, and most are simple encounters. If your guild truly knows no better then they will have a rewarding expierence.<br />
<br />
Also paves the way to embrace Pop by its balls.<br />
<br />
edit: I suggest this too because your ac is really nasty for anything beyond Luclin's lower softcap and resists start becoming really important in lter expansions.</div></div><hr />
