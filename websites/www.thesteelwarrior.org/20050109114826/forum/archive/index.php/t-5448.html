My guild has cleared VT twice now, but every time we go this mob is down.  Anyways, just out of curiosity, how hard is this guy?  I know he grav fluxes and does the anti-ds spell on you, but what's this guy's dps/hp like?  Probably 600k hp or more, I'd wager.  I just really want to know what kind of damage output he does is all.<br />
<br />
Any takers?</div></div><hr />

<br />
He hits hard enough, can't remember exact numbers but 600-800 iirc...can tank through disc...HPs are fairly high, but can't give a real estimate cos we kill him with varying numbers..30 ppl I'd say its a 5 min kill roughly..i know ive gone through def disc with him and still had to tank a while....</div></div><hr />

Aye, it's my own mage that's camped there. ;) :D</div></div><hr />

Doesn't hit hard, really, just lots of hp.  And watch out for getting grav fluxed into the door that leads out of his room if you just coth to him, that can bring adds.</div></div><hr />
