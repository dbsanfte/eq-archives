<br />
They passed us and started taking out mobs to get to him, We set back and pulled the other bird from the LONG tunnell. Then we pulled the Huge ass frog Prysomething.. We killed him and then went on into castle2, We set back and let the other guild have ther shot at Fennin, Well they WIPED OUT completly, Our monks pulled Fennin passed them up the the ramp and we engauged him at 100% of health. Then all the the sudden a GM showed up &quot;due to them /petitioning us&quot; ..The GM waited tell Fennin was at 80% of health and told us to stop killing him &quot;wtf let us wipe&quot; We didnt stop the GM then ported  our healers out one at a time and let us wipe...After all was said and done an officer of ours ask the GM why he waited so long to tell us this and NO PRE WARN us. HIS REPLY &quot; I WAS OUT OF MY SEAT GETTING A DRINK OF WATER&quot; ..My question is has this ever happened to any of yall. We were also informed that if a nother guild started the  event NO other guild can come and and take him down..&lt;3   ..Btw we play on a PNP server..I was just wandering if this has happened to any one else on your server's..</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. You LET another guild pass you while wasting yor time on trash<br />
2. You make no reference as to attempting to resolve the issue with the other guild.<br />
3. Since no accomodation was made, you should have rolled for spawn or petitioned beforehand and ended up rolling for spawn anyway.<br />
<br />
The fact that the GM intervened when he/she did has no bearing on how badly you folx messed up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, it's more than a little cheesy to pull fennin as soon as another guild wipes, a hour or so of clearing to him should buy them the right to him for that spawn.  He'll spawn again..and again..and again..and again... in 12 months he'll be the Arch Lich Rhag'zadune of POP.</div></div><hr />

I would have demanded a CS rez, and forwarded it up the chain of command if not given one and an apology.</div></div><hr />

Your posts are so entertaining.   Let's see if i got this straight.<br />
<br />
You go into PoFire to do Fennin, Another guild comes in and heads straight to Fennin, you stop, kill 2 charm birds + quavoinis + pyronis while being passed up by another guild, then you take the triggered mob that your guild did NOT spawn and are upset because the GM found a creative way of ensuring you didnt' get the kill?<br />
<br />
God it sounds like my favorite GM in the history of EQ, Hakosako who was canned from his position for poofing two mage pets when the mages were working with Lum the Mad's wife exploiting a trigered mob AFTER getting warned about it.  That GM deserves a medal of honor for porting out your healers one by one, not a trashing.<br />
<br />
I've seen some sick stuff on my server, but nothing of this magnitude.<br />
<br />
I'm serious when i ask this question, did your guild get into the EP's through one of those crazy alliance type kills where 200 people got flagged?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">08-21-2003, 08:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1 more proof Slammer's guilds are a bunch of retards.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey FR is up ! Lets Go Gank him&quot;<br />
&quot;Some Trash is up too ! Lets waste time on the trash&quot;<br />
&quot;Doh someone beat us to FR trigger&quot;<br />
&quot;Hey lets Leapfrog them&quot;<br />
<br />
Pathetic.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm really starting to believe slammer is a troll just here<br />
to entertain us, how the fuck can you not recall the name<br />
of 1 elemenal mini &quot;Prysomething&quot;.<br />
<br />
Dunno Frodin, but you'll need 400 500 slammers to zerg RZTW.<br />
200 retards like him &amp; his guild just wont cut it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomb</div><div class="date">08-21-2003, 09:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not sure, but it sounded like the other guild was the one doing the leaping in the first place.<br />
Common courtesy is usually, if a raid force is in zone and has numbers to take a mob and is not biding their time trying to get more on(like everyone sitting at zone in), you should not even enter zone.<br />
This usually worked very well for NToV and VT, so why not for elementals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wychway</div><div class="date">08-21-2003, 10:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Elementals are way different. Fire especially, you don't need to clear through to get to things. If you stop to kill something, you're damned straight other guilds will take other available targets in zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomb</div><div class="date">08-21-2003, 10:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, that explains it, i am flagged for elementals except fire, so dont know the zone yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slammer</div><div class="date">08-21-2003, 11:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Frodlin, i didnt ask for a bashing of my guild i just asked it anyone else had this happen to them....<br />
<br />
As for killing RZW give me a fucking break ..We killed the fucker with 54 thats right 54 peps. As long as i have played EQ and been in guilds &quot;2&quot;, If a nother guild wipes to the MOB is Fair game back the Velious,luclin, and now its different in pop...Check the rules there is NOTHING about script mobs...I recall our 1st attempt at SOlRO we tried to take him down &quot;we wiped&quot; another guild came in and take him down &quot;NP&quot; we learned from it and went on  did /petition and beg for a GMs help &quot;hell no&quot;..As for leaping frogging &quot;comeon&quot; killing the mobs t get to Fennin is quit easy you all know that as well as i do..<br />
<br />
Now off the subject to make things clear my guild is not a ZERG guild we have strats on the way we kill stuff we have Earned our way to where we are at by working together the same as all of the guild that are in the elements..<br />
<br />
My guild &quot;retards&quot; i think not come up with something better why not just read the thread give an opinion on what the Gm did and move on...</div></div><hr />

on that same subject show me where it is written and it stats that .../beg please show me ...I think your going to find its not Written anywhere ...</div></div><hr />

<br />
You had your choice to A) kill minis, or B) kill Fennin.<br />
<br />
You chose A, why would you then feel like Fennin was yours after another guild did the 1-2 hours of work to spawn him?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slammer</div><div class="date">08-21-2003, 12:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">'Solinar&quot; im sorry bro that was not my call there in not an officer of my guild...But i think that the reason we went down there is A.<br />
the guild that was going after had NO chance of beating him it was just do make him despawn and make us wait &quot;i say this because they had never tried him before and to my understanding they got the strats on how to kill him from the &quot;afterlife&quot; website..B. why should we sit back and let another guild RUB in our face when they NEW they could not take him down it was just an attempt to &quot;cockblock&quot; us..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ladas Sindarin</div><div class="date">08-21-2003, 12:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;it was just an attempt to &quot;cockblock&quot; us..&quot;<br />
<br />
Wow... so any time a guild fails to kill a triggered event on their first attempt, they are cockblocking all other guilds?  Interesting logic.</div></div><hr />

[Wed Jun 25 17:19:38 2003] Everyone in Highkeep is now PvP Flagged<br />
[Wed Jun 25 17:19:50 2003] So if you aren't going to play nice, kill each other.<br />
[Wed Jun 25 17:26:31 2003] You may petition after you leave the zone to have your PvP flag removed.<br />
[Wed Jun 25 17:29:16 2003] Player says out of character, 'GM's are retarded?'<br />
[Wed Jun 25 17:29:44 2003] Player has been slain by the gods.<br />
[Wed Jun 25 17:35:49 2003] I'll unpkill everyone... If I have to come back here I will not be so nice.<br />
[Wed Jun 25 17:38:46 2003] does anyone still have a red name?<br />
<br />
Devs don't like playing babysitter.<br />

Keep in mind Test is a no customer service server, there are no real GMs, but the Devs will help you out if you have a real problem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd rather not.. thanks though.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;...I was not saying that at all..&quot;<br />
<br />
You said specifically:<br />
<br />
1) the guild that was going after had NO chance of beating him it was just do make him despawn and make us wait<br />
<br />
2) i say this because they had never tried him before<br />
<br />
3) they NEW they could not take him down it was just an attempt to &quot;cockblock&quot; us..<br />
<br />
The implications you are making are they because they had never done the event before, their sole purpose for doing it now was to keep you from doing it.... like I said... nice logic.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;READ think then post just dont type what ever comes to your mind&quot;<br />
<br />
Mental note to yourself?   Perhaps you should write this on a sticky and put in the middle of your monitor.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;This post is Mainly about the GM and what he did &quot;reread&quot; my 1st please sir.&quot;<br />
<br />
This stopped being about the actions of the GM the second you started trying to find a scapegoat for your guilds inability to think clearly about target selection.  Your guild screwed up.  Can't blame the other guilds for taking advantage of your lapse of reason, any more than I blame other guilds when we make a mistake.</div></div><hr />

So you would agree with us that if you're doing 2 small birds, quavonis and pyronis, any other guild has the right to do Fennin?<br />
If you don't agree, you're an ass.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, you would agree with us on the fact that a Guild doing Fennin for the first time, has as much right to him, as a guild doing Fennin for the 50th time?<br />
You should agree of course.<br />
Since your guild too has passed that part of &quot;Trying Fennin&quot;... even if you fetched the strats on a board like this one.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for the taking over of the mob, after that guild's first wipe....<br />
If you finish the Fennin cycle in 2 hours, you still have 3 hours ahead of you for trying and retryting Fennin. Enough time for at least 4 attempts.<br />
They worked their asses to finish the cycle, to spawn Fennin, while you were busy getting molds for your guild.<br />
It may not be a written rule....<br />
but any respectfull guild would have the decency to recognise such a thing.<br />
And it is recognised by GMs.<br />
<br />
The GM was right,<br />
your guild was wrong.<br />
<br />
Dont do it again.</div></div><hr />

You have no place to bitch if you were screwing around with mini-bosses in the zone instead of Fennin. Stop whining. And about you guys jumping in after the guild failed.. wtf? No one on my server has done that to my knowledge. There are 5 Elemental guilds and not one of them felt the need to steal someone's triggered mob. You deserved what you got.</div></div><hr />

LOL, Wychway come on now lets play fair. Umm i PROMISE YOU yes &quot;i promise &quot;you&quot; by the end of next month ill be decked out in ALL element stuff..Im not cluess some people see my point &quot;read above please&quot;..I am not saying that i am right and who is wrong i made a simple statement and you want to Mock my gear give me a break...<br />
<br />
A month to be decked out in ALL elemental stuff?  If you have plate boots, a breastplate (they don't exist in the elemental planes... except off of the last mob in PoEarth B), a pair of rings and earrings, a necklace (only one decent one)... if you can fill all of those slots with elemental armor in one month, that means that your other warriors (you said you were 4th out of 6) are passing on everything, as well as all the plate wearers not wanting any of the elemental molds.<br />
<br />
I have been in the elemental planes since April, we are pretty much the only guild farming the elemental planes on Maelin Starpyre (guilds are in Time, or still are just getting started in the elementals) and I am only about halfway decked out in elemental armor.  And I am one of the top 2 tanks in my guild besides.<br />
<br />
So Slammer.  If you get in ALL elemental armor by one month from your original post, I won't think you are uber.  I will think you are very greedy and in a guild of people who want to see YOU, the 4th best warrior in the guild, to be decked out first in all these items...<br />
<br />
GOOD LUCK</div></div><hr />

Your problems are frankly semi-off topic....if it wasn't for the fact that any complaining is allowed here it should be booted.<br />
<br />
It appears to me your guild didn't have their priorities straight.  Your guild either was gambling that they could take it all or were more interested in minis than Fennin Ro.  Either case you should have been gracious and let the other guild have a full shot at Fennin.  No monster is worth a lot of ill will and trick pulling.<br />
<br />
Why burn bridges?  It sounds like these guys thing they have a shot so you may want to be at least on speaking terms with them if you need to handle a rotation with them.  Or do you enjoy having your two sides constantly racing?</div></div><hr />

&quot;why&quot; &quot;do&quot; &quot;you&quot; &quot;talk&quot; &quot;like&quot; &quot;this&quot; &quot;?&quot; Anyways. you're bitching that you &quot;got&quot; &quot;leaped&quot; &quot;on&quot; &quot;fennin&quot; but you were killing other shit at the time? No place to whine. Then you try to STEAL the mob from another guild after a wipe... wtf? lol. You make me laugh.<br />

Btw, good luck on that full elemental armor thing. Really, good luck on that.</div></div><hr />

My guild has never even seen plate boots drop yet...<br />
<br />
I don't hate you at all Slammer.  I just think your statement is funny.  My guild farms like crazy and our plate classes all had 1-3 drops after the first 6 weeks in elemental planes... leather and silk drop way more than they need to.<br />
<br />
If you meant that you would be basically outfitted in all the gear that drops in Fire, it is still incredulous.<br />
<br />
I by no means think that you are a loot whore.  I was just stating what would have to happen to get just 1 person in a guild fully outfitted in elemental armor in one month with next to no competition from other guilds.<br />
<br />
I think you are an okay guy, Slammer.  I just think you don't take the time to think about how you say things and it leaves you open for full assaults.<br />
<br />
So, if you meant, &quot;in one month I will be equipped with quite a bit of the armor drops that are possible in Fire,&quot; then TYPE THAT, not what you did type:<br />
<br />
Umm i PROMISE YOU yes &quot;i promise &quot;you&quot; by the end of next month ill be decked out in ALL element stuff</div></div><hr />

Thats due to having 3 elem flagged guilds since May, 2 on north american time, 1 on aisan time, a 4th just recently gained access a month ago thats on north american time.

<br />
You said hey Big target in fire is up, another guild has fire access, but lets do all the minis first because they can do minis too, then we'll do FRO...<br />
<br />
GUild trackerB zones in, hey look guildA is doing minis, lets try out FRO, we probably wont beat him, but we need to learn the spawn...<br />
<br />
GuildB zones in, kills trigger, spawns FRO, tries out their strat, wipes naturally...<br />
<br />
GuildA WTF omg those assholes are blowing fennin spawn<br />
<br />
runs over, tries to engage fennin, guildB petitions..<br />
<br />
We beat GuildA to a triggered mob... its still up we wiped..<br />
<br />
GM says, hey thats lame as fuck fuck you guild A and has some fun...<br />
<br />
/applaud GM..<br />
<br />
people who take triggered mobs are lame<br />

Unless you think it would be cool if guildB all camped near arbitor spawn spot while your doing rings, you spawn him then they log in and kill him?!</div></div><hr />

We set up last nite to take him down, Along the way we set up camp to take out the 2 birds at C1, As we were taking them down a different guild zoned in and headed to take out Fennin.<br />
<br />
They passed us and started taking out mobs to get to him, We set back and pulled the other bird from the LONG tunnell. Then we pulled the Huge ass frog Prysomething.. We killed him and then went on into castle2, We set back and let the other guild have ther shot at Fennin, Well they WIPED OUT completly, Our monks pulled Fennin passed them up the the ramp and we engauged him at 100% of health. Then all the the sudden a GM showed up &quot;due to them /petitioning us&quot; ..The GM waited tell Fennin was at 80% of health and told us to stop killing him &quot;wtf let us wipe&quot; We didnt stop the GM then ported  our healers out one at a time and let us wipe...After all was said and done an officer of ours ask the GM why he waited so long to tell us this and NO PRE WARN us. HIS REPLY &quot; I WAS OUT OF MY SEAT GETTING A DRINK OF WATER&quot; ..My question is has this ever happened to any of yall. We were also informed that if a nother guild started the  event NO other guild can come and and take him down..&lt;3   ..Btw we play on a PNP server..I was just wandering if this has happened to any one else on your server's..  <br />
<br />
Gonna make this brief because I know you're a retard.<br />
<br />
The other guild started the Fennin Script. The other guild engaged Fennin. The other guild wiped. You low life pieces of trash then engaged Fennin, the very same Fennin the OTHER guild laid claim to by (1) Triggering, (2) Killing the mobs within the script, and (3) Wiped to?<br />
<br />
The GM should have given everyone in your guild a warning if not outright disbanded you just on grounds that (1) What you did was reprehensible and (2) You're in the guild.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hulanta</div><div class="date">08-22-2003, 06:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Slammer, the only thing that separates you from me or anybody else who posts here is what you post here.  People choose to &quot;h8&quot; you or to like you based only on what you choose to say.<br />
<br />
Therefore, you have a few choices:<br />
<br />
1)  Status Quo.  Continue what you are doing and expect similar results.<br />
2)  Stop posting.  If you feel that everybody hates you and that you don't get the information you need from this forum, why keep coming here?  Unless you enjoy the &quot;battle&quot; and that is why you post here?<br />
3)  Post better.  Use better grammar.  Spellcheck.  Use better paragraphs.  Organize your thoughts.  Don't ask for information that you know you won't get here.  Don't attack others (do unto others as you would have them do unto you).  In other words, put some efforts into your posts.  Even this last post above mine here has lack of capitalization, bad grammar, swearing, an attack on other warrior, sarcasm, lack of proper punctuation, split infintives and more.<br />
<br />
I am not saying other people don't do some or all of these things on the board.  They do and they get similar results.  I am not trying to &quot;slam&quot; you.  Rather, I am giving you helpful tips.<br />
<br />
If you choose option 1 of the options I listed, don't be surprised if you continue to get ripped on by the other members of this community.  If you choose option 2, I am not sure if you would be missed, even if you guild leader wishes he could have 10 Slammers as you posted in the &quot;read&quot; post.  If you choose option 3, I bet that people might just come to your side and start respecting you.  You probably won't get everyone on your side, but you should see better results.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Wychway&quot; Maybe that is the way it is on your server, But on ours If u wiped to a Mob, and another guild kills it &quot;props to them&quot;<br />
on that same subject show me where it is written and it stats that .../beg please show me ...I think your going to find its not Written anywhere ...  <br />
<br />
How many ppl do you need to tell you your guild fucked up? It's very obvious that you knew they were new in PoFIre and would most likely not kill FR on first try. So you decided to farm some minis for gear while they clear the path past the trigger mob for you for NO loot, while you get some. And after they wiped you leapfrog<br />
This is a a whole lot different than your pathetic sol ro example</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brudal the Fat</div><div class="date">08-26-2003, 04:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">But the other guild &quot;new&quot; Slammers guild was going to do Fennin. Also you should stop judging him &quot;bye&quot; his posts here.<br />
<br />
But yeah, as stated already Slammer you CAN claim triggered mobs YOU triggered. Epic mobs are a great example anyone understand. GMs will get involved if someone takes your epic triggered mob and tell you that if you didn't trigger it, its not yours. Check that out if you like to verify for yourself.<br />
<br />
But to the point of the thread. If you want FR and he is up don't fart around with other named goto FR  and start the script. If the other minis are up when Fennin is dead, Yay you and your guild. Otherwise understand if you choose to take out easy targets and loose your priority for the day you have to suck it up and be adults. The GM was right and thats all there was to it, share your candy or sit in the corner on your hands.</div></div><hr />
