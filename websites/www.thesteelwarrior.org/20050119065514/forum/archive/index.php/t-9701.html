<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gargen</div><div class="date">11-10-2004, 09:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have one simple question fo you.  If you can answer it, without doging the question by stating your opinion but not actually addressing the question (or any other such dodging), I will forever run through the hills proclaiming that monks should enver get their mitigation back.  Just one simple question...<br />
<br />
<br />
If warriors with more AC/HP than knights couldn't get groups over knights because of poor aggro, what will make a monk with restored mitigation, although less HP/AC than knights and worse aggro than pre-aggro disc warriors, any threat to warriors?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: adding my further comments so they can be addressed in one quote and to hopefully avoid people saying what I'll freely admit instead of the part I don't understand.<br />
<br />
<br />
My point is that &quot;warriors, pre aggro disc&quot; &gt; monsters too, but &quot;warriors, pre aggro disc&quot; aggro &lt; dps aggro or debuff aggro which slowed the killing down and made them undesirable as tanks. I realize that monks would be able to stand up to monsters better, probably even as well as knights (although we'd still have less HP), but warriors themselves proved last year that standing up to the mobs isn't enough.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Point taken, but by the time monk AC has that much of an advantage over monster atk, healing either of them isn't a problem and the issue of aggro becomes even bigger. If an Anguish equipped monks takes less damage over time than a Anguish equipped warrior in BoT (or even PoFire), but the group kills slower because the Anguish equipped dps has to hold back... who's going to tank?<br />
<br />
I've been in groups where rangers with less AC/HP than me that everyone in the group would have admitted would take more damage than me were the tnak because they held better aggro and the healer was fully capable of healing them. Same thing with knights and warriors for that matter.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
First... tanks have never been picked based on aggro? Then what was all that warrior whining for 10 months last year over?<br />
<br />
On the subject of DPS, warriors have strikethrough AAs that help to both increase DPS and reduce damage taken while attacking from the front. Os that enough to counter the bettr ratios that monks get? I'm not sure, but it would certainly cut in to the 20% advantage that monks have. Since I don't have any parses that show how much difference those AAs make, avoid assuming the worst... but what you probably didn't realize is that before Time gear, monks can't have dps weapons and aggro weapons at the same time. In fact I'm positive, without even parsing, a pre Time monk using stun proc weapons would have worse dps than a pre Time warrior, maybe even when not tanking. We do start getting goood dps+aggro weapons in time, but that's when warriors start to recieve a whole new level of aggro weapons (such as DBotWL). It also doesn't address the fact that we don't get any snap aggro or aggro on demand and would need to rely completely on luck. I'm sure if I was inclined to do it, I could find 20 posts from warriors buried in the back of this board that talk about how how inadequate relying on proc aggro is... and this is from warriros that had better options for aggro weapons then than monks have now.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I said *before* Time gear... as in I was admitting that Staff of Trancendance (which is just as tough to come by as DBotWL) and the GoD weapons Ronnan has are good aggro, or are realative to warriors 2-4 expansions behind (depending on how you count it), but complaining about that is as rediculous as a monk saying that warriors shouldn't out dps monk 2-4 expansions behind.  We still don't have any reliable initla aggro either.  As for the other stuff...<br />
<br />
Tactical Mastery lets you strike through an opponents defensive, but in the case of riposte the riposte still hits through.<br />
<br />
Less ripostes = less damage taken, but even if it doens't affect damage taken it still counts towards the next part...<br />
<br />
<br />
 To do so, though, you are forced to do what every warrior has had to always do: sacrifice your dps for aggro. Boo hoo?<br />
<br />
First off, I personally don't really plan or even want to be a tank, but I'm not so niave as to think that if it won't happen.  Becasue of that, I'm also not only fine with loss of dps to gain aggro, I would actually advocate it to keep monks off warriors and knights toes.  The reason why loss of DPS to gain aggro matters is because it discredits this:<br />
<br />
If Monk gets enougth mitigation to match our power than we loose our role because of Monk's superior DPS.<br />
<br />
A tanking monk won't have superior dps.  Even if they don't need to swap in worse weapons, they don't have the Tactical Mastery AAs.  At most it will be a neglible difference.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Dude, come the fuck on.<br />
<br />
Nothing has changed from when Monks were tanking and warriors were useless except your mitigation.<br />
<br />
Except:<br />
Removal of the AC hardcap<br />
Itemization changes so Monks have signifcantly less AC relative to warriors<br />
Incite line of discs<br />
Increase in Mob DPS/PC HP ratio for all new content<br />
Increase in mobs that can 1 or 2 round a PC<br />
AE Taunt<br />
Tactical Mastery<br />
Heck all AAs<br />
Warrior only Aggro augs from LDoN<br />
Much more readily available aggro weapons (I think the best warrior in my guild was mainhanding a frostbringer for aggro when the nerf happened.)<br />
Min/Max play style (isn't really new, but certainly MUCH bigger than pre-PoP)<br />
Pulling being trivialized in all non raid content<br />
<br />
(And don't even try to pull some &quot;But that's crappy DPS&quot; bullshit on a class who's best non raid aggro weapons are 13/20 and 12/19)<br />
can easily be respoded to by this bit from my last post<br />
I'm also not only fine with loss of dps to gain aggro, I would actually advocate it to keep monks off warriors and knights toes.<br />
<br />
Fuckin face it. You needed a nerf. You got one, there's nothing you can do about it, so stop crying about it. It's been almost 2 fuckin years for christs sakes.<br />
I will fuckin face it that we needed a nerf.  I'd have told you that back when it happened.  I've argued it against other monks.  I'd argue it still today.  You need to fuckin face it that we don't need it any more.<br />
<br />
That is exactly the kind of post I was hoping to avoid needing to respond to.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Since when did leather have the same ac as plate armor?<br />
Leather isn't as strong as plate so you should take more damage, but it enables you to maneouver faster, than plate classes, so you should be able to avoid damage better. But when you get hit, it *should* hurt.<br />
<br />
Basically it comes down to three things:<br />
<br />
1. All armor in EQ is magic anyway so from a &quot;realistic&quot; point of view the magic is already making the armor stronger.  Of course trying to interject realism in to anything with magic is kinda silly, but I accept that magic plate should be stronger than magic leather<br />
2. A monk and warrior both wearing a Phase Spider Carapace (plate) or an Ancient Wyvernhide Tunic (leather) still wouldn't have the same defense.  Despite what you're claiming, it has nothing to do with what type of armor we wear.<br />
3. Leather armor *IS* weaker than plate armor as shown by the fact that leather armor always has lower AC on it (from PoP on at least).  We have lower AC to reflect our typically leather armor.  The 5th highest monk AC on EQRankings is 2059.  The 5th highest Warrior AC is 2878 (took 5th to avoid the fakes that are usually on top).<br />
<br />
However, monks are NOT tanks, and SHOULD NOT take the same average damage per round as one, period... they come almost too close as it is.<br />
Monks are not tanks, why do you need the mitigation if your not going to tank?<br />
You've got to be dreaming mate. Seriously, monks aren't tanks.<br />
Cor, monks are not tanks<br />
<br />
Can't argue with the the statement that monks aren't tanks.  We're not.  I could pull up quote from myself earlier in this very thread that basically says that already, however, I don't see how that translates in to us needing to have poor mitigation.  The people I quoted just said &quot;you aren't tnaks so you shouldn't get it&quot; but didn't fill in the logic between those two.  I can fully understand the logic of &quot;You aren't a tank so you shouldn't be taking tanking jobs&quot;, but we wouldn't take the jobs due to our lack of aggro.<br />
<br />
It boils back down to what I was trying to get at with my original question.  If we aren't a threat to warriors with more mitigation, then why are you so opposed to it?  Is it a &quot;I have it and you don't&quot; pride thing?  Still bitter over the pre-nerf situation?  Afraid that we may get tanking jobs in easy content when kill rate isn't important and there aren't any knights or warriors around?  I garuntee you that if a knight or warrior is available while somebody is looking for a tank, even for easy content, they will get the job over a monk.  What is it?<br />
<br />
<br />
To answer the question of &quot;what will it do for monks?&quot;  <br />
- First, it would help with pulling.  Yes there are other thigns that would help too, but that doesn't make mitigation any less helpful.  <br />
- It would help us on AE rampage mobs.  On a lot of AE rampage mobs you can avoid it at max melee, but some have a rampage area wider than that and there are the occasional hits<br />
- It would help us with soloing.  It wouldn't make us solo gods, we'd still be way behind most classes, but it would probably be enough to make it so monk soloing wasn't a joke.  I realize that warriors can't solo, but at least you guys are desired in groups, and if they were going to give warriros the ability to solo just a little bit, I'd support it (even for Pumilio and Apolyon)<br />
- I personally would hope it would give groups a reason to at least consider me over a rogue or wizard when looking for DPS because I have emergency offtanking ability.  It's not good enough tanking ability to be the main tank, but it's good enough if the MT goes down or an add comes around.  We can do it now as any class that can survive a couple rounds can, but we certainly aren't good enough at it to have anybody consider it when filling groups.<br />
<br />
In short, it would help us just a little bit in almost everything we did.<br />
<br />
If monks getting better mitigation would help a class that I hope even the folks here would admit really needs some love, and it would do so without taking anybodies job away, then I ask you this.  Why shouldn't we get it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why not just ask, how can monks be a problem for warriors with increased mitigation?<br />
<br />
The answer is you do not need to match, or exceed another class to be a threat you only need to exceed the monster, because of this a monk could be a better tank than a warrior on the same monster because they get hit less (no damage) while still mitigating<br />
<br />
I'm sure you will shoot holes thru this, but Frod probibly has a less fractured all inclusive version to shut ya up :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
In otherwords, since mitigation and avoidance are differnt you can end up being a better tank than a warrior, which should never happen... then again this is because sony likes to monkey with mob attack rates so it works this way :/<br />
<br />
basically I can have 1700 ac and the monk may only have 1500, but the monster has an effective attack of 1400.. meaning that we I may take 3 or 4 less damage then you do, while avoidance does not suffer diminishing returns, infact it gets better the lower the attack rate is of the monster (not sure about this, dont grill me if I am wrong)<br />
<br />
so you can be tank+avoidance while we remain tank+nothing</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for aggro? there is a wide range of stun weapons that monks may use, while you may not be the best DPS thats just one of the tradeoffs for being a tank.<br />
<br />
I am not trying to be an ass, but the only people to consider monks a tanking class in everquest was monk players themselves, I do not know where this idea comes from for sure but I think it mutated from a wish to get mitigation nerf reperation to the current wish to mitigate at a tanking level.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">11-11-2004, 04:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1. tanking power<br />
Tanking is being able to reduce mob DPS to survive its repeated blows. Warrior is, up to now, defined as the best tank. <br />
If Monk gets enougth mitigation to match our power than we loose our role because of Monk's superior DPS. if they match knights power they will kick them out of their group-tank role because of Monk's superior DPS. If they get subpart tanking role from knights (or better up to whatever you want), Monks will greatly increase their soloability and SoE don't like solo meleer.<br />
<br />
2. on aggro power for a tank<br />
yes the more aggro tanks generate, the better is fight ends. but Tanks have NEVER been choosed by their aggro power but their ability to survive best. I mean that are ordered by their HP/AC not by their hability to ease DPS class. Knights are generally better than us on locking aggro but they aren't choosed to MT often because we have a better survability.<br />
Thus if Monks get strong tanking tool they WILL be a threat for the existing tanks (us, but not only us). Monks already have strong DPS and better swing hate generation than knights, thus they can get high on the aggro list if they really want to (WA5+5 x stun procs).<br />
<br />
3. personnal notes<br />
I think that a tanking monk with its mend ability will out tank everyother tank, and will be an ultimate solo class and I don't want it to happen. Moreover I think it's nonesense to say that a silk armor can mitigate naerly as well as a plate armor. just by this specification monks have to mitigate like a deep shit and get smashed whenever they get three hits straight. Sure they are specialized in avoiding blows, I would mind to see them avoiding 95% of a lvl80 Mob, but if they get hit more than two or three times by this given mob they must fall down in pulpe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First part right second part wrong.  Tactical Mastery lets you strike through an opponents defensive, but in the case of riposte the riposte still hits through.  It's an offensive aa only.  We have other aa's that help us avoid in defensive ways (slippery attacks etc).<br />
<br />
Time gear, monks can't have dps weapons and aggro weapons at the same time<br />
<br />
Umm ...<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=592&amp;resize=true<br />
<br />
The other monk has stun.  JoS = very good aggro and would work wonderfully in the offhand paired with this.  If i'm not mistaken the staff of tranc. from Time is also a stun proc weapon with an amazing ratio.  Can we say BoWar 1.5 for monks?  VDD is also decent aggro, and i know monks with it.<br />
<br />
Is your aggro as strong as an endgame warrior?  I hope not.  Is your aggro as strong as an endgame paladin if you want it to be?  Immediately no, but over time it's probably stronger.<br />
<br />
If you want aggro you can go out of your way to get it and still maintain strong dps.  Duel stun augs + innate stun and debuff + WA5 = lots of aggro.  Unless a warrior is lucky enough to get a DBoTWL or a BBoB, i'd dare say you could match him almost toe to toe in aggro generation minus incite and taunt.<br />
<br />
Prior to time you could buy 2 SoD's with yak augs or a CHoS + yak aug .. there are a few different weapons you can have with decent aggro on them.  To do so, though, you are forced to do what every warrior has had to always do: sacrifice your dps for aggro.  Boo hoo?  If you want to tank you have to pay the price.<br />
<br />
The end.</div></div><hr />

Nothing has changed from when Monks were tanking and warriors were useless except your mitigation.<br />
<br />
You can still bust out a Tstaff and hold aggro (And don't even try to pull some &quot;But that's crappy DPS&quot; bullshit on a class who's best non raid aggro weapons are 13/20 and 12/19).<br />
<br />
The smart monks still use the skills they have when they need to get aggro (And if you don't think anyone used Instill Doubt to their advantage, you're ignoring that too).<br />
<br />
Fuckin face it.  You needed a nerf.  You got one, there's nothing you can do about it, so stop crying about it.  It's been almost 2 fuckin years for christs sakes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Respond to it or not ... but tactical mastery does not let you negate the riposte itself.  You will hit through the parry persay but the counterstrike will still land on you.  It is an offensive aa only.  Anyways they are a perk for the warrior class alone.  They're an offensive based aa assuming that the user is tanking.  Since you're not a tanking class why should you get our toys?<br />
<br />

<br />
And this was in response to your reference to pre-Time monks.  No i did not simply ignore what you said.  Since you are a dps oriented class, in order to hold aggro over a class which is geared towards aggro and tanking you have to give up something ... your dps ... in just the same manner that I, a non dps class, would have to give up something to put out respecatable damage (which i'm not intended to do) ... which is my ability to tank.<br />
<br />
It goes both ways.  We've been giving up dps for aggro holding abilities since the dawn of everquest (well almost).  Up until time our aggro combos are generally inferior to other combinations which yield substantially higher dps.  Once at time level our aggro weapons are dps weapons ... but then again so too are your dps now aggro weapons.<br />
<br />
In regards to your tanking weapons being inferior to what warriors had 2+ expansions ago ... the best warrior weapon is still 2+ expansions ago.  It's not like warriors have moved past the DBoTWL here.  While everyone else's weapons have moved forward in dps and utility, warriors are technically *stuck* 2 expansions ago if they want the best aggro available.  DBoTWL &gt; everything as of right now.<br />
<br />
As to your last post:  to each their own.  If you want an answer from Frod only i strongly suggest using PM's.<br />
<br />
It's the same fucking whine/argument that's been rehashed 1000 times.  It's nothing new, so please do everyone a favor and shut the fuck up and spare us another 20 page thread.  If you really want to pursue the issue you could have easily raised from the dead one of the hundreds of monk-instigated posts already in this forum.<br />
<br />
Bottom line though:  you're not intended to tank, therefore don't complain that you have no bonus for tanking over a warrior (albeit more hps ... mitigation ... or frontal dps).  It's not your job.</div></div><hr />

Nothing has changed from when Monks were tanking and warriors were useless except your mitigation.<br />
<br />
Except:<br />
Removal of the AC hardcap<br />
Itemization changes so Monks have signifcantly less AC relative to warriors<br />
Incite line of discs<br />
Increase in Mob DPS/PC HP ratio for all new content<br />
Increase in mobs that can 1 or 2 round a PC<br />
AE Taunt<br />
Tactical Mastery<br />
Heck all AAs<br />
Warrior only Aggro augs from LDoN<br />
Much more readily available aggro weapons (I think the best warrior in my guild was mainhanding a frostbringer for aggro when the nerf happened.)<br />
Min/Max play style (isn't really new, but certainly MUCH bigger than pre-PoP)<br />
Pulling being trivialized in all non raid content<br />
<br />
(And don't even try to pull some &quot;But that's crappy DPS&quot; bullshit on a class who's best non raid aggro weapons are 13/20 and 12/19)<br />
can easily be respoded to by this bit from my last post<br />
I'm also not only fine with loss of dps to gain aggro, I would actually advocate it to keep monks off warriors and knights toes.<br />
<br />
<br />
Fuckin face it. You needed a nerf. You got one, there's nothing you can do about it, so stop crying about it. It's been almost 2 fuckin years for christs sakes.<br />
I will fuckin face it that we needed a nerf.  I'd have told you that back when it happened.  I've argued it against other monks.  I'd argue it still today.  You need to fuckin face it that we don't need it any more.<br />

The aggro differential is just too large now. Not to say that it would never happen or that it's not possible for a monk to rep a tank with increased tanking ability, it just would be the exception and not the rule.<br />
<br />
However, monks are NOT tanks, and SHOULD NOT take the same average damage per round as one, period... they come almost too close as it is. The problem of taking too much damage when pulling unslowed and un-debuffed mobs can be addressed in other ways, such as improved avoidance of damage taken from behind, increased running speed and the like. Increase monk tanking ability, and you just go from monks having a beef, to knights having a beef... knights already complain that their tanking ability is too close to nontanks, they'd be up in arms if a nontank got their tanking abilities increased.<br />
<br />
I reinterate, monks are NOT tanks, so they should not take the same average damage per round (or even anywhere close) as one.</div></div><hr />

Leather isn't as strong as plate so you should take more damage, but it enables you to maneouver faster, than plate classes, so you should be able to avoid damage better.

pre Incite-Bellow discs.  This was during POP and before Time gear<br />
<br />
Reason, I play a Shaman.  And I will tell you for a fact, that between Slow, and then Landing Bane (420 Tic Dot) and Poison Dot (320 Tic + double agro from poison counters) ((or back then 2 Poison Dots)) no warrior was good enough to hold agro over me.<br />
<br />
With just 2 dots, even a Blade of War warrior, wouldn't hold agro over me trying to do max dps.  A paladin or SK could.<br />
<br />
So I always picked Paladins and SKs over Warriors.<br />
<br />
Fast Forward:<br />
With SCS3,<br />
With Warrior Improvements:  More Anger Procs via Augments, and WA5, and Snap Agro.<br />
<br />
A warrior now can grab agro as I debuff.   And they can hold agro as I lay on the Debuffs and Dots.   Knights can too.  But of course, War &gt; Knight for mitigation<br />
and for some of the nastier named and MPG trials I like to play in.   So I will pick a War over a Knight 9/10s of time.   And all is right with the world.<br />
<br />
--------------<br />
<br />
If you repeal the Monk Mitigation Nerf in its entirity.   You will create a class that was like the old version warriors..   A Monk Alive doesn't exist that will grab agro on incoming over my Debuffs.   A Monk Alive doesnt exist that will maintain agro for 50%+ of the fight when as a Shaman I lay out the dots.    Yes some stun weapons help.  But it's not even close to the Agro I create as a shaman.<br />
<br />
Even if Monks close the gap in mitigation with Warriors and Knights.    Even if against trivial content where everyone is way more AC than the content ((Anguish Chars vs say Walls of Slaughter))  the truth is that War &amp; Knights will still be preferred by me (and 90% of groups) because of Agro.<br />
<br />
What repealing the nerf will do however, is allow monks to off tank better in groups.   Allow monks to fill in for groups LFtank that can't find a better tank.<br />
<br />
IE: it will make monks the equivlent of shaman healers.  Doable in a group in a pinch, but far outnumbered and outdesired by druid (knight) and cleric (warrior)</div></div><hr />

Leather isn't as strong as plate so you should take more damage, but it enables you to maneouver faster, than plate classes, so you should be able to avoid damage better. But when you get hit, it *should* hurt.<br />
<br />
Basically it comes down to three things:<br />
<br />
1. All armor in EQ is magic anyway so from a &quot;realistic&quot; point of view the magic is already making the armor stronger.  Of course trying to interject realism in to anything with magic is kinda silly, but I accept that magic plate should be stronger than magic leather<br />
2. A monk and warrior both wearing a Phase Spider Carapace (plate) or an Ancient Wyvernhide Tunic (leather) still wouldn't have the same defense.  Despite what you're claiming, it has nothing to do with what type of armor we wear.<br />
3. Leather armor *IS* weaker than plate armor as shown by the fact that leather armor always has lower AC on it (from PoP on at least).  We have lower AC to reflect our typically leather armor.  The 5th highest monk AC on EQRankings is 2059.  The 5th highest Warrior AC is 2878 (took 5th to avoid the fakes that are usually on top).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
However, monks are NOT tanks, and SHOULD NOT take the same average damage per round as one, period... they come almost too close as it is.<br />
Monks are not tanks, why do you need the mitigation if your not going to tank?<br />
You've got to be dreaming mate. Seriously, monks aren't tanks.<br />
Cor, monks are not tanks<br />
<br />
Can't argue with the the statement that monks aren't tanks.  We're not.  I could pull up quote from myself earlier in this very thread that basically says that already, however, I don't see how that translates in to us needing to have poor mitigation.  The people I quoted just said &quot;you aren't tnaks so you shouldn't get it&quot; but didn't fill in the logic between those two.  I can fully understand the logic of &quot;You aren't a tank so you shouldn't be taking tanking jobs&quot;, but we wouldn't take the jobs due to our lack of aggro.<br />
<br />
It boils back down to what I was trying to get at with my original question.  If we aren't a threat to warriors with more mitigation, then why are you so opposed to it?  Is it a &quot;I have it and you don't&quot; pride thing?  Still bitter over the pre-nerf situation?  Afraid that we may get tanking jobs in easy content when kill rate isn't important and there aren't any knights or warriors around?  I garuntee you that if a knight or warrior is available while somebody is looking for a tank, even for easy content, they will get the job over a monk.  What is it?<br />
<br />
<br />
To answer the question of &quot;what will it do for monks?&quot;  <br />
- First, it would help with pulling.  Yes there are other thigns that would help too, but that doesn't make mitigation any less helpful.  <br />
- It would help us on AE rampage mobs.  On a lot of AE rampage mobs you can avoid it at max melee, but some have a rampage area wider than that and there are the occasional hits<br />
- It would help us with soloing.  It wouldn't make us solo gods, we'd still be way behind most classes, but it would probably be enough to make it so monk soloing wasn't a joke.  I realize that warriors can't solo, but at least you guys are desired in groups, and if they were going to give warriros the ability to solo just a little bit, I'd support it (even for Pumilio and Apolyon)<br />
- I personally would hope it would give groups a reason to at least consider me over a rogue or wizard when looking for DPS because I have emergency offtanking ability.  It's not good enough tanking ability to be the main tank, but it's good enough if the MT goes down or an add comes around.  We can do it now as any class that can survive a couple rounds can, but we certainly aren't good enough at it to have anybody consider it when filling groups.<br />
<br />
In short, it would help us just a little bit in almost everything we did.<br />
<br />
<br />
If monks getting better mitigation would help a class that I hope even the folks here would admit really needs some love, and it would do so without taking anybodies job away, then I ask you this.  Why shouldn't we get it?</div></div><hr />

Warriors have 1 more agro tool that monks do not have, the incite line.  We do also have taunt, but that is only usefull for when we loose  agro, and is prone to failure.  Other than this, monks can use agro weapons, can generate DPS, can stand close to the mob...all those tools warriors use for agro, monks have too.  With the mitigation penalty removed, you would be able to tank...not as well as a plate tank, but certainly well enough for most situations.<br />
<br />

Simply put, I do not see a repeal of the nerf as needed.  I do not think it would solve monks problems, and would take away from working to find real solutions for monks.  Making tanks better able to tank will not help monks get groups, because monks are not tanks.  How about looking for things that will help make monks better monks?  I know this is harder than whining about monks favorite older grievance, but it might actually do you some good.<br />

Let me lay it out for you.  As has been pointed out repeatedly here, monks are not tanks, and should not be able to fill a tanking role.  Period, end of story.  This includes tank mezzing/off tanking.  Tanking is not a monks role, and monks should not be able to do it any more than a wizzy or a druid can.   Instead of asking for things you do not need, you should be asking for things that will help you in your role, to further that role, and thereby make you more desirable for groups.  If you do this, I will back you 100 %.</div></div><hr />

A couple reasons I oppose monk mitigation nerf being repealed.  1)  I remember back pre nerf, when even at level I was playing(low 50's level, EXPing in KC/Chardok/Seb) monks seemed to almost want to tank.  'Oh, I don't FD agro cuz I can take the hits same as you, and it costs me DPS', or not wanting a new tank to replace one leaving, cuz we would be better off with a DPS class and the monk tanking.  I want to take no chance of going back to that type situation.  2)  Simply put, I do not see a repeal of the nerf as needed.  I do not think it would solve monks problems, and would take away from working to find real solutions for monks.<br />
<br />
I refer you back to post 13 where 90% of that was already adressed and remind you that at any given point of the game, warriors always have superior aggro weapons available.  Don't forget that the main point of incite/bellow is not to give you uber aggro over time, but to give you some form of initial aggro on demand to keep the mobs off the debuffers.  Monks still have nothign for that (and they shouldn't).<br />
<br />

So what you are saying is that a monk cannot get stun proccing weapons?  Of course thay can, and if you will look around this board, you will see that the consensus is that stuns are the best procs for agro.

This is true, that is the point of the Incite line, and it works fairly well.  What you seem to forget tho is that while pre-incite, knights where preferred for exp groups, warriors where certainly able to function.

If you want to play a tank class, roll one up.  Till then, realize that a monks role is as puller/DPS, and this is not likely to change.

I've actually read that enitre thread and I think I may have even posted in it.  While there were certainly some people that believe that stuns are the best aggro it wasn't anything near a consensus.  I got the impression most warriors didnt' agree with it by the end.  A monks can get stun proccing weapons, but a monk with stun procing weapons has worse dps than a warrior, no initial aggro, less HP.  Still the last man on the list.<br />

<br />
2059 is not almost as high as 2878.  Monk DPS is not better aggro than warrior aggro because I don't steal aggro off warriors.  Any monk weapon with stun procs either A) completely negate any dps advantage (while still not giving us any instant aggro or more AC) or B) are only available at the point of the game when warriors have much better options (including better aggro augs)<br />
<br />
If monks got their mitigation back and a group was looking for a tank and a Paladin, Shadowknight, Warrior, and Monk, all from the same guild, are LFG... who gets the first tell?  Who gets the last tell?  Why not let monks be the last man down the line? Is it a &quot;I have it and you don't&quot; pride thing? Still bitter over the pre-nerf situation?

Well... I think this thread is to the point that that there isn't anyhting else left to say and all I'll do for the rest of it is repeat myself (which is typically the case on page 3 on any message board) so here's a summary.<br />
<br />
<br />
Assuming you don't compare classes from different progression levels...<br />
<br />
Monks always have less HP<br />
Monks always have less AC (which would be somewhat countered by avoidance in tough situations, mostly countered in average situations, more than make up for it in easy situations) <br />
Monks never have better aggro procs available to them than warriors<br />
Monks never have on demand aggro<br />
Monks don't have AE taunt (which I've seen save many groups from a wipe)<br />
Monks mostly or completely lose their DPS advantage while tanking<br />
Monks would be the last in line to tank if they got mitigation (and in some places it still wouldn't be viable and for min/max players probably wouldn't be picked if it was content where they could tank)<br />
Monks wouldn't take any tanking jobs from warriors or knights if they got better mitigation<br />
Monks would be helped in many other ways if they got better mitigation<br />
Monks need help somewhere<br />
Better DPS won't help (we'll always be worse than those above us... just like we are right now, mitigation gives us new tricks which allows for gain without taking from anyone)<br />
The hardest part of pulling (groups or raids) is minimizing the damage taken while pulling (to save healer mana or to not die)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
There you have it.  All in one nice neat bundle that is much smaller than monster my first post has become.  With that I'll probably go to only browsing the thread.  Unless somebody comes up with a new argument, I agree that there's no point in wearing out my typing fingers any more.  ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
No shit? its intended and not an excuse to be powered up, as a class that is NOT a tank they do not need them, it is also important to note that this only matters in a raid set up as once you get enough aggro you can xp tank just fine<br />

<br />
No shit? its intended and not an excuse to be powered up. when you fight it is eather to tank or to do damage, you have to choose just like us and the fact that you even try to do any sort of tanking is retarded<br />
<br />

<br />
No shit? its intended and not an excuse to be powered up. MONKS ARE NOT MAIN TANKS, OFF TANKS, 87TH in LINE TANKS OR ANYTHING AT ALL LIKE THAT. (yell at the retarded children, it helps them learn)<br />
<br />
Monks wouldn't take any tanking jobs from warriors or knights if they got better mitigation<br />
<br />
No shit? its intended and not an excuse to be powered up, not to mention bullshit, I can already see the uber guild monks doing just fine in casual groups.<br />
<br />
Monks would be helped in many other ways if they got better mitigation<br />
Monks need help somewhere<br />
<br />
Maybe, but a dodge bonus would help them in their job as DPS and for the rare times they get aggro on accident (which proves that they can get aggro over a warrior)<br />
<br />
Better DPS won't help (we'll always be worse than those above us... just like we are right now, mitigation gives us new tricks which allows for gain without taking from anyone)<br />
<br />
How would you know? if monks did more DPS I would take em, gain without taking from anyone is the most retarded thing I've seen, mudflation and the trickle down effect does its damage<br />
<br />
The hardest part of pulling (groups or raids) is minimizing the damage taken while pulling (to save healer mana or to not die)<br />
<br />
Umm do what they did in ADnD and give monks a runspeed bonus that stacks with everything, and a skill that allows them to avoid most melee damage from behind on pulls (tho they call these attacks of opertunity or however ya spell it)<br />
<br />
I'd rather take no damage than half damage<br />
<br />
You will never be a tanking class, you were never ment to be a tanking class, your a leather class who sits behind berserkers and rangers in the pecking order so JUST DEAL WITH IT, why doesn't the monk class just unite under one banner of something that will help them do their job as pullers and DPS instead of fighting on every pure melee/hybrid class balance battle field, perhaps you will get something done except make yourself look childish for wanting a ball that looks shiny and holding an old grudge.<br />
<br />
The only 3 classes with bitching rights IMO is enchanter, shaman and paladins.<br />
<br />
enchanters because they are almost useless in OoW, shaman because they are useless in OoW and paladins because sony is saying they want them to be a crowd control class instead of a tank in omens, using roots and stuns.</div></div><hr />

If Frodlin's is the only opinion you sought, you could easily PM him, no?  Do you honestly think ANY warrior is going to advocate monks getting more mitigation?  Seems to me all yer doing is the equivalent to throwing a rock into a hornet's nest just to see what happens.  Well...in case ya didn't know, that pisses them off.  That's the only motive I can see behind yer post-again....PMs if you just wanted to talk to one person ;).  <br />
<br />
Second-why not come up with ideas that will help monks excel at certain things they are already good at, such as pulling or dps?  I'm sure that would be met with much more support-not only from the posters on this board, but by the devs and decision makers at SoE.  Although from what I've seen in your copy/pasted responses to other posters, you have no desire at all to do that as you're stuck on this mitigation thing, so I'm probably wasting my time with this post.<br />
<br />
Finally, If you decide not to take the advice offered by me and other posters, please just keep it on the monk boards or use PMs.  Or I dunno-original idea-copy and paste your first post, which you're apparently so fond and think has flawless logic, and send it as an email to SoE-see what they think of it  ;) .</div></div><hr />

<br />
This has been hashed over and over before, increasing your mitigation is placing your ability to tank above all the classes it should be behind. (not talking about war/pal/sk) but RANGERS (you know the chain class with a taunt button) Berserkers, hell bards should tank better =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daemonwynd</div><div class="date">11-12-2004, 11:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">See, this is where Gargen's agenda becomes painfully obvious.<br />
<br />
Monks constantly use the justification of being able to pull better, to justify a mitigation increase.<br />
<br />
The fact is, a mitigation increase isn't necessarily required.<br />
<br />
There is zero justification for asking for increased mitigation given present monk tanking abilities, with the understanding that the increased ability to pull can be given with several other additions and changes to the class, changes that are incidentally far less harmful to present class balance.<br />
<br />
You already take damage like, if not better than a ranger, a TRUE light tank, who have a taunt button and all.<br />
<br />
Taking damage like a ranger, when a ranger is a light tank and a monk is not, already shows monks to be borderline overpowered.<br />
<br />
And, not only do you out tank chain wearing (IE the next class of armour UP) rangers, you out tank PLATE wearing bards and CHAIN wearing rogues, as well as beastlords. You out tank EVERY class in the game, with the exception of the 3 primary tanks alone. And you want to be able to tank even better yet? How freaking greedy are you?<br />
<br />
<br />
I reiterate. Monks are NOT tanks, and should not take damage like one. <br />
<br />
<br />
I've almost had to reach the conclusion that some monks just are pursuing the agenda of regaining the ability to be as good of tanks as they used to be, and will make any argument they can that supports their position, regardless to the truth of the argument used. Note how this monk utterly ignores the other suggestions for improved pulling ability that I've made, and is single mindedly pursing mitigation improvements. That shows the only thing that matters is the mitigation upgrade, obtained by any means possible.<br />
<br />
<br />
In answer to a question posed above: Why must monk mitigation be as low as it is? The answer, is that that is the balance to their unquestioned advantage in avoidance ability. If monk mitigation were NOT lower, the combination would be overpowered. Such was the case before the nerf, and because of it, the present balance will in all likelyhood remain.<br />
<br />
Gargen:<br />
I *DON'T* want to be a tank class. How many times do I need to say it.<br />
Simple answer here: Your actions speak much louder than your words. In this case your actions in calling for significant mitigation upgrades (which would make you a tank level damage taker), speak much louder than your words stating that you do not want to be a tank.<br />
<br />
There is much truth to be found in old sayings.<br />
<br />
Additionally, your own words contradict themselves. On one hand you say you don't want to be a tank, on the other hand you're asking for the ability to offTANK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">11-13-2004, 03:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why not let monks be the last man down the line? Is it a &quot;I have it and you don't&quot; pride thing? Still bitter over the pre-nerf situation? Afraid that we may get tanking jobs in easy content when kill rate isn't important and there aren't any knights or warriors around? I garuntee you that if a knight or warrior is available while somebody is looking for a tank, even for easy content, they will get the job over a monk. What is it?<br />
<br />
(and yes that last part is word for word from a previous post because it still doesn't address it.)<br />
<br />
Since, even tho these have been addressed by people here, you refuse to see that, I will adress these one by one for you.  <br />
<br />
First, 'Why not let monks be the last man down the line?':  Wait a minute, you also said 'I *DON'T* want to be a tank class. How many times do I need to say it.'  So which is it, do you want to be a tank class, or do you not want to be one.  Please make up your mind.  As far as why, because Tanking is not a monk role (bolded since despite numerous repeated comments here to this nature, you still have not gotten it).  That spot rightly belongs to rangers.  They are part tank(hense the taunt button).<br />
<br />
Second, 'Still bitter over the pre-nerf situation?'.  Personally, probably a little bit, but that does not effect the arguments here, except that I do not want a repeat.  Note also that implied insults to people you are asking for support from is not the best route to go.<br />
<br />
Third, 'Afraid that we may get tanking jobs in easy content when kill rate isn't important and there aren't any knights or warriors around?'.  I see the issue here a bit different.  What is easy content?  Easy content for me is challenging to a more 'casual' 'family guild' type player.  Should high end monks be able to take tanking jobs from casual players?<br />
<br />
To repeat a point:<br />
<br />
I *DON'T* want to be a tank class. How many times do I need to say it.<br />
<br />
You specifically state that you want to be able to offtank, that you want to be a tanking choice when warriors and knights are not around, and you want an ability that will let you tank.  You complain about the circular arguments, but you then argue two different ways, depending on which is most convienient.  If we say you are not a tank, you say you don't want to tank, if we say that mitigation is not the solution to your problems, you say it would let you tank in some situations which leads us back to saying you are not a tank.<br />
<br />

<br />
I bolded those I want to comment on.<br />
<br />
'Monks never have better aggro procs available to them than warriors' -  But you do have access to good enough agro procs.<br />
<br />
'Monks don't have AE taunt (which I've seen save many groups from a wipe)' - Nor do knights, but they function as tanks quite well.<br />
<br />
'Monks mostly or completely lose their DPS advantage while tanking' - This is simply put your weakest argument.  Tanks are not chosen for DPS, so it is pretty irrelevent.  Also, I disbeleive that monks would fall behind the tank classes in terms of DPS while tanking.<br />
<br />
'Monks would be the last in line to tank if they got mitigation (and in some places it still wouldn't be viable and for min/max players probably wouldn't be picked if it was content where they could tank)' - Monks tanking almost any content is simply wrong.  You are not tanks.  Get that simple fact thru your head.  Just because you would not be able to tank hard content does not mean it is ok for you to tank easier content, because(repeat it with me) you are not a tank.<br />
<br />
'Monks need help somewhere' - Holy shit, we agree on something!  I do think monks need help, but to repeat a comment you keep overlooking(inconvienient to you?):  Mitigation is not the answer, and all the effort you are making trying to get it repealed is taking away from finding real solutions that would actually enhance a monks role in groups.<br />
<br />
'The hardest part of pulling (groups or raids) is minimizing the damage taken while pulling (to save healer mana or to not die)' - and there are other, and probably better, ways to address this other than increasing monk mitigation again.<br />
<br />
It is time to get off the mitigation bandwagon.  It is going nowhere, nor will it, nor should it.  Look for real solutions, real things to help monks...things that will help you to be better pullers, better DPS, better monks .  If you do that, I will support you with no qualms.</div></div><hr />

The short version is simple:<br />
<br />
You're not tanks, your role is not tanking.  The fact that you WANT to tank is clear indication that the line of crap about &quot;waaa, we only want to survive on pulls&quot; is a pile of shit and indicates that you shoudlnt' get any upgrades just because you're a pack of ravenous liars.<br />
<br />
The &quot;choice&quot; of tank doesn't come when there's 2 available toons, each of whom is measured against one another, it comes when the available pool of players is assessed, and if one is completely sufficient to take over the role without being motivated to add a 'real tank', then you've taken a tank's job.   <br />
<br />
The fact is monks can tank just fine for what they are, and don't need a thing, either aggro OR mitigation improvements, they are defensively PERFECT.   Currently a group in omens can survive uncomfortably using a monk to tank.    That's EXACTLY where it should be, with the group motivated to seek a real tank, but able to do &quot;ok&quot; with the monk tanking in the interim.<br />
<br />
You aren't tanks, you shouldn't be a valid choice for group tanks, but you should have a measure of survivability, which you have now.<br />

And shaman can heal outside of a pinch too, don't bs a tanking class over tanking, we know what it takes fairly well :p<br />
<br />
hell, berserkers come before you do.<br />
<br />
Actually, I think from a historical standpoint you are wrong.   I think many people made monks and played monks for YEARS because they were the 4th Tank Class.<br />
<br />
Those are the people who when this nerf hit, it hit them hardest.   And those<br />
are the monks who quit/scaled back a lot.<br />
<br />
And I wouldn't call Pal/Sks = to shaman healers.   Druid or better for sure.<br />
<br />
Again in comparison, standpoint<br />
Tank: War - Knight - ??<br />
Healer: Clr - Druid - Shaman<br />
<br />
I'd put the monk where the ?? belongs.<br />
<br />
As for the whole Plate vs Leather vs Chain.  Its an old tired Cliche.   Most importantly please explain with any rough level of realism why a 30 AC EARRING<br />
on a monk is worth less than the same exact ear on a Warrior.<br />
<br />
Warriors/Knights will have higher AC due to Magic Plate &gt; Magic Leather.  Sure<br />
But I don't understand why the best monk with full Gates/Omens gear and 1900 ac should tank worse than a far worse equipped elemental tank with 1800 AC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">corlathist</div><div class="date">11-15-2004, 12:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you want to play a tank class, roll one up.  Till then, realize that a monks role is as puller/DPS, and this is not likely to change.  So work on solutions for being a better puller/DPS, and within the context of the monk role, to improve monk group desirability.  Whining about the mitigation nerf is not going to help the monk class one bit, and even ifthe nerf was removed, it would not fix monk problems.<br />
<br />
Here's where i think you are being shortsighted and definging others in such a way that doesn't hurt you, but rather hurts them.   <br />
<br />
Monk's role used to include: make due tank until better comes along, and off tank capability.   These were WELL DEFINED and usable roles until the nerf.<br />
<br />
-----------<br />
<br />
Let's try some reverse logic:<br />
If you believe that these were never roles for the monk....<br />
Can you explain why so many guilds lost monks en masse to retirment due to this issue?<br />
<br />
If it was NOT a role, you wouldnt have so many people feelign cheated and nerfed even years later.<br />
<br />
-------------<br />
<br />
As for your agro stuff.  And that Stun &gt; all agro.<br />
<br />
What game do you play?   Again, I play a Shaman.   And I will tell you for a FACT<br />
that a Monk with a Staff of Transcesence with a Guk Stun Aug vs a War with DBOW &amp; EE with Anger Augs.<br />
<br />
The monk can't hold agro over me a shaman for 50% of the fight.  Agro will bounce like mad, and I will tank quite a bit.   CHs are out on healer as they will be assist spotting.   All in all, a bad XPing situation.<br />
<br />
The warrior will hold agro.   Often with Bellow, I wont take a single hit.<br />
<br />
And yes, this is instantly noticible especially cause I often use a ST 1 Pt Rune 2 FT<br />
clicky.   With a good warrior I can go mob after mob with the 1 pt rune in tact.<br />
With a monk, I wouldnt even click it.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Back to Roles for a Sec.<br />
<br />
Monks should be better tanking class than other DPS classes like Wizards, Rangers, Rogues, Magicians for the simplest of all reasons.  They bring less to a group.<br />
<br />
Wiz/Mage/Rogues &gt; more dps than the monk<br />
Ranger &gt; more utility than the monk<br />
<br />
Yes Monks Pull, but I hate to tell you pulling isn't a very big role now a days in many many places because of outdoor spacing and because of lull classes.   Being able to pull doesn't make up for the &gt;&gt; thats always against the monk above.<br />
<br />
The irony is that its the same logic Warriors hug and rely on in comparing themselves to knights.   is what they refuse to accept and help out a fellow melee class with.  Monks suffer from lack of utility/dps compared to other dps classes.<br />
<br />
Off tanking, and poor man tanking, would add thier utility.</div></div><hr />

Monk aggro is honestly not too shabby. I use a VDD with ykesha aug for aggro, in MPG/ele exp groups, potime raids, etc etc. I have very very few problems with aggro; not getting a proc of any kind for 30 seconds tends to end with a dps class getting hit a few times.<br />
<br />
VDD+Ykesha, WA5, Combat Effects gear, offensive AAs... all of this monks can get and use, and if it works for me without using bazu on every single pull in MPG, monks could do it also. Hell, they have more dps than my lousy sub-1600 atk and ~20 dps AAs, so they could do it better.<br />

pre Incite-Bellow discs.  This was during POP and before Time gear<br />
<br />
Reason, I play a Shaman.<br />
Sorry dicked up shaman poison dot aggro is not the benchmark by which tanking is measured. My wiz could outdamage you all day and still not get aggro from a monk tank.<br />
<br />
How do I know?<br />
<br />
I routinely tank my ranger who has no problems tanking most grp content in OoW (MPG/RS is albeit tougher). His dps along with procs (max AAs dps/aggro aas for ranja) is more than sufficient to hold down a mob. Is he perfect? Hell no, but given that he can challenge my warrior (DB/CScim anger3 augged with WA5, SoP, etc. etc. etc.) with his dps/procs/aas alone is quit interesting.<br />
<br />
They are often fighting (when warrior tanks) for aggro till 75-80%, assuming warrior doesnt pull a lucky string of procs relative to ranger. Only advantage ranger has is pull aggro.<br />
<br />
And for the record debuffs occassionally pull aggro but less than 5% of time and ranger just as likely to lose as warrior (I cast debuffs 1 sec after first hit with tash/slow coming from chanter/shammy at same time).<br />
<br />
Just because you play a certain way doesnt mean that it cant be done another way.<br />

<br />
By that logic, EQ only needs 4 classes, and monks are not one of them.  All you need are warriors, clerics, bards, and rogues/wizards.<br />
<br />
Also, I don't think your fellow warriors would be too happy with you, posting blatant locker room prep talk fodder for SK and Pallies who are clearly obsolete compared to a warrior's superior tanking ability and dps.<br />
<br />
Bottom line, your thinking is detrimental to a game in which there are no archetypes.  Your thinking would work quite well in EQ2, which is an archetype based game, but not in EQ1, which is not an archetype based game.  You really shouldn't confuse the two, because you won't like how warriors in EQ will turn out.<br />
<br />
The only possible end result, according to your ideas, is to have Warriors and Paladins nerfed down to SK tanking levels.  Warriors and SK will be nerfed down to Pally dps levels.  Pally and SK will be nerfed down to Warrior utility levels.  Not only that, but &quot;light tanks&quot; such as rangers will be given a significant tanking boost, enough to actually be a light tank for ALL experience areas of the game and to be an off-tank in raids.<br />
<br />
Now, I don't think you really want this all to happen, so let's assume, for the sake of arguement, that your words were in error or in jest.  What you really meant to say is that there are a number of factors that make a good tank, and that EQ is a hierarchy based game so naturally there is a hierarchy between ALL classes with respect to their tanking ability.<br />
<br />
There are many factors that contribute to the ability to tank: HP, aggro, mitigation, avoidance, and other factors that are hard to lump together (shielding mod, stuns, innate DI bonus, discs, and whether or not other abilities of the class are hampered if they tank).  A knowledgeable player will notice that every class in EQ can be ranked in each area to form a hierarchy.  These hierarchies can then be compared, with the &quot;tank classes&quot; being the classes that are high on every individual hierarchy.  So let's rank some classes.<br />
<br />
Hit Points:<br />
1. Warrior<br />
2. Knights<br />
3. other plate classes<br />
4. chain classes<br />
5. leather classes<br />
6. silk classes<br />
<br />
Aggro:<br />
1. Warrior<br />
2. Knights<br />
3. debuffers (Shaman, Enchanter, Druid, Ranger, Mages, Necro, Beastlord)<br />
4. dps classes<br />
5. healers<br />
6. Bards<br />
<br />
(In reality, chain casting debuffs could be the best aggro.  However, in practice, this never happens except for kiting groups.  Also, the rankings are at my stage of the game, where warriors with DBoTW, Echo of Anger focus and access to incite upgrades are common.  I do empathise with warriors before this stage, as access to those 3 things revolutionize warrior aggro abilities.)<br />
<br />
Mitigation:<br />
1. Warrior<br />
2. Knights<br />
3, other plate classes<br />
4. chain classes<br />
5. leather classes (not incuding monks)<br />
6. silk classes<br />
7. monks<br />
<br />
(There is some speculation as to whether or not enchanters have hidden class based mitigation bonuses.  The ease at which they tank PoTime and other raid mobs certainly lends some weight.)<br />
<br />
Avoidance:<br />
1. Monks<br />
2. Beastlords<br />
3. Warrior<br />
4. Knights<br />
5. other melee classes<br />
6. caster classes<br />
<br />
Other factors:<br />
It is impossible to rank classes in this manner, so this will just be a listing of class strengths and weaknesses.<br />
<br />
1. Casters cast, bards sing, melee dps hit from the back.  Casters/bards can be interrupted by tanking.  As such, these classes primary abilities are impared by tanking: cleric, bard, shaman, druid, enchanter, wizard, mage, necro.  Melee dps classes suffer a dps penalty when tanking.  The higher the dps, the more total dps that is lost when tanking.  Rogues suffer the most, followed by berserkers, ranger, monks, warrior, SK and then Pally.<br />
<br />
2. Shielding mods are the realm of the plate class.  I'm not sure if any non-plate class can attain the 35 shielding cap.  Even within the  plate classes, shielding for warriors is easier to attain than shielding as a SK or Pally, with bards and clerics falling much further behind.<br />
<br />
3. Innate DI bonus.  Solely the realm of warriors.  The DI bonus does almost nothing for a min hit, but has substantial benefits for a max hit.  In other words, the deadly affects of a bad round of 4 max hits is significantly reduced.  So much so that warriors don't really have bad rounds.  At least not like other classes have bad rounds.  A bad round for a warrior is an average round for every other class.<br />
<br />
4. Discs.  Warriors have the only long duration defensive based discs in the game.  Monks and beastlords have very short, but very effective defensive based discs.  Rangers have the king of riposte based discs due to it's length.<br />
<br />
5. Stuns.  When they work, stuns are awesome.  They stop a mob from melee combat and interrupt spells.  However, a stun that is actually long enough to stop a slowed mob from melee combat rounds is pretty rare and many mobs are immune or highly resistant<br />
<br />
All in all, warriors do very well in this &quot;other&quot; category.  The only area they suffer in is lack of stuns.  The only area monks are good at are the disc abilities and mend.  Monks are average at not suffering a penalty from tanking.  Monks are poor at all the other areas.<br />
<br />
So, with every class ranked, lets see what the average is.<br />
<br />
Warrior (1 + 1 + 1 + 3)/4 = 1.50<br />
SK (2 + 2 + 2 + 4)/4 = 2.50<br />
Pally (2 + 2 + 2 + 4)/4 = 2.50<br />
Beastlord (5 + 3 + 5 + 2)/4 = 3.75<br />
Ranger (4 + 3 + 4 + 5)/4 = 4.00<br />
Monk (5 + 4 + 7 + 1)/4 = 4.25<br />
Cleric (3 + 5 + 3 + 6)/4 = 4.25<br />
Bard (3 + 6 + 3 + 5)/4 = 4.25<br />
Berserker (4 + 4 + 4 + 5) = 4.25<br />
Shaman (4 + 3 + 4 + 6)/4 = 4.25<br />
Rogue (4 + 4 + 4 + 5)/4 = 4.25<br />
Enchanter (6 + 3 + 6 + 6)/4 = 5.25<br />
Druid (5 + 5 + 5 + 6)/4 = 5.25<br />
Mage (6 + 3 + 6 + 6)/4 = 5.25<br />
Necro (6 + 3 + 6 + 6)/4 = 5.25<br />
Wizard (6 + 3 + 6 + 6)/4 = 5.25<br />
<br />
And you know what, that order is pretty much dead on as far as the desirability of tanks.  Groups always look for warriors first, then knights, then everyone else is far behind.  <br />
<br />
Improving monk mitigation won't change that.  Monks could be given greater mitigation than warriors and they still wouldn't be first picked for tanks.  In fact, they wouldn't even be picked in front of knights, though they would be a solid #4 choice and a viable offtank or emergency tank for when the main tank dies/goes LD.<br />
<br />
Improving monk mitigation to be equal to the other leather class's mitigation, which is what most monks want, would move monks up to be on par with beastlords and slightly better than rangers, yet still far behind warriors and even knights.<br />
<br />
But anyway, back to your origional quote.  There are only 3 primary abilities in EQ: tanking, dps, and healing.  Monks are the only class that are not top tier in at least 1 of those abilities.  Yes, our DPS needs to be increased to reach the lower part of the top tier dps and to separate monk from warrior dps.  However, that still leaves monks lacking.  For example, look at shaman.  They are the bottom of the top tier of healing, and yet they are almost in the top tier of dps.  Also, look at yourselves.  Warriors are the undisputed top tier of tanking, and yet are almost in the top tier of dps as well since, at present, they do similar dps as monks if they wanted to.  <br />
<br />
By logical analogy, monks, even after a dps boost to put us into the bottom of the top tier of dps, we would also need a mitigation boost to put us at the top of the second tier of tanking.  Of course, we probably wouldn't complain if we were given second tierhealing ability instead, on par with beastlords, paladins, rangers, etc.  Given how defensive warrirors are about anyone near their tanking spotlight, I wouldn't be surprised to see warriors coming out in favor of giving monks secondary healing roles (group mend anyone?).<br />

They bring less to a group.<br />
<br />
Wiz/Mage/Rogues &gt; more dps than the monk<br />
Ranger &gt; more utility than the monk<br />
<br />
Yes Monks Pull, but I hate to tell you pulling isn't a very big role now a days in many many places because of outdoor spacing and because of lull classes.   Being able to pull doesn't make up for the &gt;&gt; thats always against the monk above.<br />
<br />
The irony is that its the same logic Warriors hug and rely on in comparing themselves to knights.   is what they refuse to accept and help out a fellow melee class with.  Monks suffer from lack of utility/dps compared to other dps classes.<br />
<br />
Off tanking, and poor man tanking, would add thier utility.<br />
<br />
Monks sould not  be better tanks than rangers at the very least.  Rangers are part tank, and should most definatly be better able to tank(and more desirable in that role) than a monk.<br />
<br />
So, let's look at what you are saying...pulling is not a big role any more, so instead of pushing for more need for harder to pull content, you just would rather be a tank.  What you seem to fail to realize is that you are going to get no support, zero, none for this from warriors here, for all the obvious reasons.  You cry for help, but then offer only one possible solution, and one that is obviously not going to go over well.</div></div><hr />

Cor, shaman are the second healer imo because the amount of buffs they give out improve the group effinceny to a point that I would not want a druid as my only healer.. as far as groups go this is only impossible in the hardest area's and druids can not function there eather.<br />
<br />
what about rangers? I don't care how much training you get, if a sword slices your gut then your dead, at least rangers have some protection.<br />
<br />
Why is 30 ac worth more on a warrior? simply because we have had the training with armor to know that if we can not avoid a hit we need to try to brace/posistion ourselves so that our armor takes the blow, not a joint or exposed skin.<br />
<br />
As to why you should not tank better than an elemental tank, its because you are not a tank, just like I am not a cleric so I can not go around being a better healer...<br />

basically your saying that a class can be the biggest newb to a job, as long as it can afford the best armor it should work better.... *laughs at the thought of nobles in the best armor getting killed and stripped of it*<br />

<br />
Yup, you're right, they did.  That doesn't mean that was the design intention.  It just means that was what happened.  If, for example, wizards could tank like a ranger due to itemization, and therefore lots of people rolled up wizards because they wanted to play a &quot;fourth&quot; tank class, and that was never the design intention, or if upon reflection the developers realized that they'd made a mistake along the way and gotten away from what wizards were really supposed to be, then it really should come as no surprise when they fix it.</div></div><hr />

They got rid of the ridiculous AC itemization on pure melee items which slaps warriors very badly too (pure melee item = leather AC, pure hybrid item = plate AC) so you actually have some 50AC items that a monk can wear as opposed to 15AC, so it is quite possible for a monk to hit at least chain-like AC (and possibly plate if you spend some time decking out in all melee gear) and they're never supposed to mitigate as well as a chain class, so the AC nerf is still needed.  They still have their avoidance as always.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What the hell kind of convoluted crap is that?    <br />
<br />
Let's see... I'll get my bullshit detector out and count the number of serious asinine statements I can find in a single post full of unconnected statements.<br />
<br />
Asinine statement #1:<br />
<br />
By that logic, EQ only needs 4 classes, and monks are not one of them. All you need are warriors, clerics, bards, and rogues/wizards.<br />
<br />
Happens to be the first paragraph.  I got a newsflash, EQ doesnt' 'need' monks, they don't 'need' anyone, they provide 16 classes to play, it would be really clumsy if all 16 classes were 'needed' in each group, considering a 6 man limit on groups.   Warriors are no more 'needed' than monks or Paladins or anyone else.   They're good to have, but in single group content they're not 'needed'.   <br />
<br />
Next asinine statement (#2)<br />
<br />
<br />
Bottom line, your thinking is detrimental to a game in which there are no archetypes. Your thinking would work quite well in EQ2, which is an archetype based game, but not in EQ1, which is not an archetype based game. You really shouldn't confuse the two, because you won't like how warriors in EQ will turn out.<br />
<br />
Newsflash, EQ1 has ALWAYS had archetypes, to claim this late in the game that there arent' archetypes is insane.  Anyone who has a taunt button is a tank... guess who that leaves out....<br />
<br />
<br />
Asinine Statement #3<br />
<br />
<br />
The only possible end result, according to your ideas, is to have Warriors and Paladins nerfed down to SK tanking levels. Warriors and SK will be nerfed down to Pally dps levels. Pally and SK will be nerfed down to Warrior utility levels. Not only that, but &quot;light tanks&quot; such as rangers will be given a significant tanking boost, enough to actually be a light tank for ALL experience areas of the game and to be an off-tank in raids.<br />
<br />
What the hell are you talking about?   Different tanking types are more robust than others, and if you reach a damage output on a mob that exceeds the robustness of one tank, that's not a problem, you move up a tier.   Even monks can fit into this little description.  How you come to the conclusion that because groups look for available players and use non tanks to tank while they are still motivated to seek a more robust tank to increase the rate of killage or decrease the danger, that you must have absolute identicality in those tank classes?   <br />
<br />
Oh I know, you pulled it out of your ass because you want that to be the case.<br />
<br />
Your figures are all arbitrary, pretty much correct in those categories, although leaving out craploads of other nuances and roles, and your analysis that there's only 3 roles in EQ, and therefore you want one of those 3, while retaining all of the roles that make you unique (High DPS melee, Pulling, Survival/CR, etc) is nothing but oversimplificationand obfuscating the subtleties that make EQ different.  <br />
<br />
My favorite phrase you used though is this:<br />
<br />
By logical analogy, monks, even after a dps boost to put us into the bottom of the top tier of dps, we would also need a mitigation boost to put us at the top of the second tier of tanking. <br />
<br />
What the hell is a &quot;Logical analogy&quot;, and where's the &quot;analogy&quot; part of that statement?    No, typing a bunch of words and then summarizing with &quot;We need more mitigation&quot; is meaningless.  You dont' need more mitigation than you have.   Your mitigation is fine for what you are... a pack of ravenous liars who claim you want mitigation for &quot;pulling&quot;... lies... nothing but lies.</div></div><hr />

You know as well as I do that SoE is not going the make a puller mandatory in experience groups.  It really never has been, so no reason to start now.  Can you imagine the outcry of players when they find out they need a tank, healer, slower AND puller?  No, not gonna happen.  Instant death of EQ.  EQ is already dying because of the unnatural need for the existing holy trinity.  The &quot;best times of EQ,&quot; by most consensus, was back when the holy trinity was NOT needed for a normal experience group.  For the most part, that was Kunark, Velious, and to a lesser extent, Luclin.  <br />
<br />
The other argument against making expansions harder to pull is that class-balancing by expansions DOES NOT WORK.  Warriors at the end game today are just fine on aggro, but that requires DBoTW, Echo of Anger focus, and an upgrade to the Incite line.  Many warriors at this stage don't even bother with a stunning offhander, anger augs, or stun augs, since, in their own words, &quot;That much aggro is wasted.  I'd rather do more dps.&quot;<br />
<br />
Those aggro upgrades come courtesy of new expansions.  Are bazaar and pre-elemental warriors happy that warriors get nice, new aggro upgrades that they have no hope of getting?  Hell no!  Take a look at your own boards and you will see the &quot;casual&quot; warrior just as unhappy as monks because they lack the necessities of being a good tank in high level experience zones.  That is exactly what using expansions as class-balancing tools will do.  It just doesn't work and you still manage to piss off half the player base for whom the upgrade is intended for.<br />

<br />
Those casual warriors that are unhappy about aggro USE those augments that you try to have people believe are not used, to make themselves an Enraging Blow level aggro weapon that you used to have to be in a raiding guild to get. With the addition of incite, which any warrior can get, casual warriors are in a far better position than they ever have been before.<br />
<br />
Secondly, I haven't heard of a single warrior that said they'd rather do more DPS than do better aggro. Every warrior in my guild for example has aggro procs on any weapon they tank with, NOT DPS. If they have any concern with additional DPS whatsoever, they use a FoY proc, which incidentally does 125DD along with the aggro.<br />
<br />
You take a look at the top 20 on my server for example, you will notice that contrary to your BS claim of &quot;not bothering with aggro augments&quot;, &quot;because they'd rather be doing more DPS&quot;, nearly EVERY SINGLE warrior has aggro augments on their weapons, on top of the innate procs. Read: You're full of it.</div></div><hr />

SOE has done a damn fine job of 'rising tides lifting all boats' lately. Class balancing by content works. GoD destroyed my SK. In OoW, my SK is so much more powerful that I wonder if I am even playing the same game. I am fully capable of tanking, though there are places that I don't have the gear for yet. Yet our warrior was an order of magnitude more effective, with only slightly better gear than me - The way it should be. The squishies are squishy. The way it should be.

Gotta love people who exagerate what some one says, then argue against that exageration.  I never suggested making pullers mandatory in experience groups.  Never said it.  '...so instead of pushing for more need for harder to pull content...' is what I said(and mangled gramatically...I was in a hurry).  Harder to pull does not = FD puller required.  There should be ways to handle the situation without an FD puller...but having one would help a great deal.  Currently, monk pulling is often slower than a Paci class pulling, and frequently, anyone can pull singles in a zone(MPG as an example).  If instead content was made that the easiest way to handle was to have an FD puller, but that other methods worked...why this might help monks out.  Note this is just one example of how you can work for improvements within  your classes role(and probably by no means the best one).<br />
<br />
As usual tho, instead of looking at other solutions for monk issues, you see only the repeal of the mitigation nerf.  Your arguments are so weak that one monk here keeps flip flopping over whether or not he wants to tank, while you can't even argue against what people have said, but have to exagerate and argue against that.</div></div><hr />

I'm not sure where where you got the supposed quote, but it was not by me.  I'm sure the real author would like to receive the real &quot;credit.&quot;<br />
<br />
Happens to be the first paragraph. I got a newsflash, EQ doesnt' 'need' monks, they don't 'need' anyone, they provide 16 classes to play, it would be really clumsy if all 16 classes were 'needed' in each group, considering a 6 man limit on groups. Warriors are no more 'needed' than monks or Paladins or anyone else. They're good to have, but in single group content they're not 'needed'.  <br />
<br />
You are absolutely right that EQ does not need monks.  Monks could all be deleted or changed to some other class and NOTHING in EQ needs to be changed, rebalanced, retuned or modified in any way.  Expeience groups will get just as much experience and have just as many places to hunt.  Raids will still have ample pullers, mobs will get there just as fast, wipes will still be rare.  If anyone can come up with a situation where EQ needs monks and needs to be re-designed if monks were erased, please let me know.  At least then I will know how to advertise my services.<br />
<br />
However, the same can't be said of warriors.  How many single group encounters require a warrior unless you want to have multiple healers?  The answer is lots.  Knights still make piss poor tanks for Hearstriker Jhiru in tipt, even rangers are better thanks to weaponshield.  Many new epic battles are, for the most part, cake with a warrior and yet can still lead to wipes with a Pally or SK because they lack defensive.  Those encounters are 1-3 group affairs.  And raids?  The entire raiding design will have to be overhauled becase warriors are THE raid tank, no exceptions.  The devs will spend less time cranking out several new expansions than overhauling EQ to get rid of warriors.<br />
<br />
(Just to pre-empt the counter-arguemnt I know is going to come:  Giving defensive to Pallies and SKs will *almost*, but not quite, eliminate the need for rebalancing and retuning EQ in the absence of warriors.  Many raid mobs will have to be slightly retuned to account for the HP disparity, the DI-1 disparity, and the lack of SK and Pally to keep and hold aggro via spells on mobs that interrupt and stun back.  Rebalancing and re-tuning is still required, though much reduced.)<br />
<br />
<br />
Newsflash, EQ1 has ALWAYS had archetypes, to claim this late in the game that there arent' archetypes is insane. Anyone who has a taunt button is a tank... guess who that leaves out....<br />
<br />
I don't think you are using archetype as used by the gaming community.  If Monks, SK, Paladins, Warriors, and Rangers all took the same DPS, had the same aggro, and had the same HP, then they would be said to be a tanking archetype.  The key is equality.  If you don't notice the difference between the class that is tanking, then they can be said to be archetypes.  If you do notice a difference, then they are not archetypes, but a hierarchy.  Hierarchy means that one is better than another.  Archetype does not.  EQ is clearly not an archetype game.<br />
<br />
<br />
What the hell are you talking about? Different tanking types are more robust than others, and if you reach a damage output on a mob that exceeds the robustness of one tank, that's not a problem, you move up a tier.<br />
<br />
Again, it proves that EQ is not an archetype game.  If EQ were an archetype game, then anything a warrior could do, a SK or Pally could also do.  How they accomplish the task will be different.  What they can accomplish will be the same.  So if EQ were an archetype game, then if a SK can't tank Heartstriker Jhiru with 1 healer, then neither could a warrior.  There would be no more tiers to move up to.<br />
<br />
Your figures are all arbitrary, pretty much correct in those categories, although leaving out craploads of other nuances and roles, and your analysis that there's only 3 roles in EQ, and therefore you want one of those 3, while retaining all of the roles that make you unique (High DPS melee, Pulling, Survival/CR, etc) is nothing but oversimplificationand obfuscating the subtleties that make EQ different.<br />
<br />
The figures are arbitrary you say, and yet they are pretty much correct?  That doesn't sound so arbitrary to me.  And what about the final list?  Did you at all deny the order of desirability of tanks?  Did you at all deny how far down the list monks are compared to warriors?  No.  How can you possibly be so adamant against moving monks up to rangers or even beastlords when you know damn well it won't affect the desirabilty of warriors?<br />
<br />
Also, I said that there are 3 primary roles in EQ, not that there are only 3 roles.  There are numerous secondary and tertiary roles.  <br />
<br />
Slowing is a secondary role, though many arguments can be made that it should be a primary role.  For the high end zones, slowing is pretty mandatory.  However, many casual player zones can still get by without a slower.  In addition, enough dps or a well equipped warrior can significantly reduce or even eliminate the need for a slower.<br />
<br />
Pulling is a secondary role.  A good puller will make the group more efficeint but in todays game, a puller is anyone who knows a little bit about pathing, aggro radius, and timing (aka, anyone who wants to learn).  <br />
<br />
Corpse recovery is at best a tertiary role.  Would you rather look for someone who can recover from a wipe or look for someone who can eliminate the wipe in the first place?  <br />
<br />
Buffing is a secondary role since so many buffs last for hours.  If the buffs lasted seconds or minutes, it might well be a primary role.<br />
<br />
Your mitigation is fine for what you are... a pack of ravenous liars who claim you want mitigation for &quot;pulling&quot;... lies... nothing but lies.<br />
<br />
If monk mitigation actually scaled up since &quot;The Nerf&quot; then our mitigation might actually be fine.  Unfortunately, that is the problem: it hasn't.  Our mitigation potential has remained the same yet the potential of every other class has gone up.  AC on armor is useless if you only need 16 to 20 AC on each armor slot to reach your soft cap, and above that is meaningless.  If we were balanced at the begining of PoP, we certainly are not now since our mitigation potential has not gone up.<br />
<br />
Imagine if the AC on warrior armor is the same now as it was at the end of Luclin.  There would be no doubt such on oversight would be on the warrior top 10 list.  Such an oversight would be on EVERY class top 10 list. Why then do warriors get so bent out of shape because the monks want their oversight looked at?<br />
<br />
Perhaps warriors are afraid that if monks, a non-tanking class, can get their mitigation looked at, then SK and Paladins, tanking classes, will get theirs looked at as well.  Warriors are not afraid of monks taking over the tanking spot in groups so much as they are afraid of SK and Pallies doing so, which they are afraid might happen if monks get their wish, and in turn SK and Paladins get theirs.<br />
<br />
Oh, and don't kid yourself.  Even with a significant mitigation boost to make them mitigate just as well as warriors, monks would still not replace warriors or knights as the wanted tank for experience group.  The aggro difference and the hit point difference would still be too great for a monk to make up.  Maybe if monks were given superior mitigation over a warrior.... but no one is talking about that, not even close.<br />
<br />
And for the record, there are many situations where an increase in monk mitigation does not interfere with tanking classes.  <br />
<br />
1. AE Rampage mobs are the bane of my existence.  I die more to AE Ramp (as a percentage of encounters) than to pulling.  Since the DX9 patch, there is no longer a spot where we can do melee damage and still be out of range of rampage.  In fact, the opposite is true.  It is quite easy to be in rampage range and yet out of melee range.  My guild is at the Txevu stage right now, which means AE rampage mobs.  Lots and lots of AE rampage.  I hear Tacvi is even worse and Anguish just as bad.<br />
<br />
2. Rampage tank for single group mobs.  Less damage taken is less damage taken.  Monks are usually the default puller (even if other classes would be the better choice), which means they usually take the ramage damage.  Anything that reduces healer mana spent on players who are not the main tank is a good thing.<br />
<br />
3. Pulling.  Any mitigation increase will help survivability on pulls.  Anyone who says otherwise has no idea what they are talking about.  True, other solutions may also help survivablity on pulls.  Namely, avoidance can.  Special new monk only abilities can.  SoE devs are reluctant to hand out new class only abilities but it does happen so special new monk only abilities might be possible.   Monks are already the best avoidance class and  SoE Devs are also reluctant to give the best class of XYZ an improvement in XYZ.  But again, it has happened (warriors given the DI-1 bonus) so maybe it's possible for monks.  But you know what?  I still bet that the devs will increase monk mitigation before they increase our avoidance or give us new unique abilities.  Not only does it fix many problems, but it doesn't interfere with other classes (if balanced properly) and is an easy fix.<br />
<br />
4. Corpse recovery.  Monks are not like rogues.  We don't have SoS.  We do have FD, and are safe as long as we are FD, but moving corpses involves moving, which can't happen if we are FD.  At some point, we have to stand up.  Even fully geared, moving corpses in many areas is a crap shoot.  It all depends on how fast mobs run (thanks to GoD and OoW, mant mobs are faster than run5), whether or not we get lucky with stuns (I'm sure glad the anti-kiting code affects monks more than kiting classes), and whether or not mobs see regular invis.  Mitigation can only help the corpse retrieval process and can mean the difference between wating 6 minutes for mend to refresh or being able to get the corpses quickly.<br />
<br />
I don't think that warriors are against monks receiving upgrades and benefits in these areas.  Mitigation happens to be a weak area for monks and happens to offer a solution to each of those four areas.  It also happens to be the easiest solution for the devs and programmers to implement (which seems to be the only real factor in many cases).  <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, for some reason, warriors see mitigation as the only difference between themselves and monks.  Warriors are afraid, for whatever reason, of giving monks a mitigation boost.  However, the reality is that the mitigation disparity between warriors and monks is so vast that there is more than enough room to give monks a boost, even a significant boost, and still be far behind warriors in mitigation let alone tanking ability.  <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, nothing short of thousands of hours of parsing will convince anyone otherwise.  I would like to undertake such an endeavor (I parse everything) but I don't have the time nor can I even tank in places such as Kod'Taz, Qvic, MPG, or Riftseekers without 2 healers and a slower.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sear</div><div class="date">11-16-2004, 05:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Secondly, I haven't heard of a single warrior that said they'd rather do more DPS than do better aggro. Every warrior in my guild for example has aggro procs on any weapon they tank with, NOT DPS. If they have any concern with additional DPS whatsoever, they use a FoY proc, which incidentally does 125DD along with the aggro.<br />
<br />
You take a look at the top 20 on my server for example, you will notice that contrary to your BS claim of &quot;not bothering with aggro augments&quot;, &quot;because they'd rather be doing more DPS&quot;, nearly EVERY SINGLE warrior has aggro augments on their weapons, on top of the innate procs. Read: You're full of it.<br />
<br />
<br />
I never said the warriors were not concerned with having aggro.  On the contrary, they were testing how much aggro was needed at a raid and in experience groups.  In their own words, there comes a point where they do so much aggro that more is not needed.  It's not possible to eliminate the over-nuker syndrome but at least for experience groups, casters don't have the mana regen to overnuke on every single mob.  A good caster will spread out their nukes, not get aggro, and still do maximum damage that mana regen will allow.  That leaves aggro by heal, slow, debuff, and backstab.  It is entirely possible for a warrior to not use any anger or stun augs, and yet have more than enough aggro to overcome these events.  In this light, there are some situations where dps at the expence of aggro is a good thing.  If a tank says they don't need anger or stun to keep aggro in experience groups, and I can see with my own eyes that others don't steal aggro from them, I will take their word for it.<br />
<br />
Gotta love people who exagerate what some one says, then argue against that exageration. I never suggested making pullers mandatory in experience groups. Never said it. '...so instead of pushing for more need for harder to pull content...' is what I said(and mangled gramatically...I was in a hurry). Harder to pull does not = FD puller required. There should be ways to handle the situation without an FD puller...but having one would help a great deal. Currently, monk pulling is often slower than a Paci class pulling, and frequently, anyone can pull singles in a zone(MPG as an example). If instead content was made that the easiest way to handle was to have an FD puller, but that other methods worked...why this might help monks out. Note this is just one example of how you can work for improvements within your classes role(and probably by no means the best one).<br />
<br />
No exaggeration on my part.  All that content exists today, but groups are so trained they don't go to those spots that need a puller.  <br />
<br />
PoEarth has spots that need some type of puller/mezzer/kiter and yet you can get single mobs all day long.  PoFire is singles all day long.  So is PoWater.  Vxed and Tipt are mostly singles but a mezzer or kiter is sufficient for the few spots that are not single and when a puller is not available.  Kod'Taz has many temple areas where a puller is needed but experience groups don't go there.  Yxtta and Qvic have areas with nothing but singles and groups stick to those rather than hunt in places where a puller is needed.  They stick to the wide open fields of roamers where singles are easy to pick off.  WoS is all singles except for raid targets.  MPG is all singles except for a few circle rooms with 3 mobs in aggro range but groups don't touch those.  Groups stay at the Taskfiend, Blind, or Odium camp.  Riftseekers is all singles as well (the parts I have been to).  All it takes is someone half attentive to watch out for roamers.<br />
<br />
The one area that I have not mentioned before, LDoN, deserves special attention.  Level 65 normal adventures are so easy that groups just pull entire rooms.  No puller is needed since the mobs are so weak, and the warrior is often the puller.  Level 65 hard adventures, at one time, needed crowd control in the form of mezzing or pulling.  Thats fine, lots of classes work as pullers in this situation: monk, SK, necro, bard, enchanter, mage, cleric.  What made hard LDoNs special for monks is that lull pulling, except for the monk version, was nerfed.  Bards, Enchanters, and clerics had a double resist check, which made their lulls more than twice as likely to fail and cause a train.  Monk lull was still unresistable.  Green pet pulling and mez pulling still worked, but are less well known, for whatever reason.  Therefore, hard LDoNs marked a high point for monk pullers.  If more content existed like that today, we might be a wanted class again.  However, note that bards, enchanters, and clerics complained about nerfing lull pulling in hard LDoNs just as much as warriors are complaining about any possible mitigation increase for monks.<br />
<br />
So, in summation, yes, there are locations where a puller is wanted and even needed.  However, groups don't go there.  I maintain that unless EVERY location and EVERY situation requires a puller, then groups will just migrate to the areas where no puller is needed.  If groups just migrate to the area where no puller is needed, then pulling will never be a primary ability.  Urging for more pulling content is pointless unless you go all the way and urge for nothing but pulling content.  And as I said before, that will not happen, so it is not a viable solution.<br />
<br />
As usual tho, instead of looking at other solutions for monk issues, you see only the repeal of the mitigation nerf. Your arguments are so weak that one monk here keeps flip flopping over whether or not he wants to tank, while you can't even argue against what people have said, but have to exagerate and argue against that.<br />
<br />
Monks have many issues and will require many solutions.  DPS is the biggest problem, in my mind, and in the stage of the game that I am at.  Lack of pulling content in raids and groups is the second (yes it is my number 2 concern, although I can't, in good conscience, recommend any changes for groups).  Survivability on raids is third.  However, only one of those issues affects warriors: survivability on raids, and only if increasing mitigation is the answer.  We both know that mitigation is the only monk issue what will be discussed on a warrior forum.  <br />
<br />
I can only speak for myself, but I don't want, nor expect, a repeal of the mitigation nerf.  I do want an increase though.  The two are not the same.  First of all, the mitigation nerf was a change from hard caps to soft caps.  Soft caps are not going to go away, so the &quot;mitigation nerf&quot; will never go away.  <br />
<br />
However, the soft cap numbers can be adjusted to return monks to their PoP (post nerf) mitigation numbers.  If monks were returned to the numbers shown in Brodda's parses (X% worse mitigation than warriors or Y% worse dps than warriors) I would be thrilled.  That would be a monumental increase but I don't expect such a large jump.  I would be happy with some smaller increase, provided we don't have to be rebalanced in the next expansion when AC values go up, but monks don't see any increase because of overly harsh softcap values.  The soft cap isn't very soft.<br />
<br />
Monks say, &quot;we need our mitigation returned&quot;.<br />
<br />
Warriors say, &quot;you don't need your mitigation returned&quot;.<br />
<br />
Monks say, &quot;yes we do, because we need to be able to pull better&quot;.<br />
<br />
Warriors say, &quot;there are other ways to improve your pulling, mitigation will have the side effect of making you better tanks&quot;.<br />
<br />
Monks say, &quot;we don't want to be tanks&quot;.<br />
<br />
Warriors say, &quot;then you don't need improved mitigation, you need better pulling tools&quot;.<br />
<br />
Monks say, &quot;we have asked for better pulling tools, but they haven't given us what we want&quot;.<br />
<br />
Warriors say, &quot;what have you asked for that you haven't gotten&quot;?<br />
<br />
Monks say, &quot;our mitigation returned&quot;.<br />
<br />
Warriors slap their foreheads with their open hands, pulling their hands slowly over their eyes, and begin to curse under their breath.<br />
<br />
That is pretty good.  :) <br />
<br />
And yet, it represents the underlying problem.  I'm sure we are all familiar with the recent bard AE DoT kiting changes/nerfs.  I am so jealous of that.  Not that they were nerfed, but that the devs came to the bards, opened a line of communication, and worked out a solution which was better than the origional solution the devs wanted to implement.  The nerf went though several iterations as players voiced their concerns and offered suggestions.  <br />
<br />
I wish the same could be said of monks at the time of the mitigation nerf.  The monks knew what the problem was (high AC all/all gear).  The players knew what the problem was (AC hard caps).  The players knew which situations in which to make the most use of a monks talents (exploiting the rampage list through FD).  So instead of talking with monks and players to identify and fix the specific problems, a rushed blanket solution was forced on us.  Oh, a &quot;solution&quot; that didn't quite affect the target audience at the time of the nerf and a &quot;solution&quot; which effectively froze effective AC on a monk at pre-PoP levels.<br />
<br />
If discussion like the bard AE DoT kiting nerf discussion took place so many years ago, monks would not still be here today calling for a change.  Be lucky you are a warrior, an essential class that forms the base of the tanking pyramid.  What you want will be heard, will likely be implemented, and all other classes will be balanced to you.  Be lucky you have a correspondent that plays the game, posts on your class forums, and is actually level 70.  No one can question the lobbying that Frodlin does on behalf of the warrior community, even if it results in a worse game for other classes (Shadow Knights, Paladins, and Monks come to mind).<br />

Monk aggro is honestly not too shabby. I use a VDD with ykesha aug for aggro, in MPG/ele exp groups, potime raids, etc etc. I have very very few problems with aggro; not getting a proc of any kind for 30 seconds tends to end with a dps class getting hit a few times.<br />
<br />
VDD+Ykesha, WA5, Combat Effects gear, offensive AAs... all of this monks can get and use, and if it works for me without using bazu on every single pull in MPG, monks could do it also. Hell, they have more dps than my lousy sub-1600 atk and ~20 dps AAs, so they could do it better.<br />
<br />
Now, back to your regularly scheduled mitigation bitching<br />
<br />
Your looking at it though from a Monk vs Warrior arguement.<br />
I'm not playing either class.  I'm playing a Shaman.   And I'm quite honestly an Agro Magnet.   I will tell you that using your VDD you will not hold agro reliably over me as a shaman going all out.   Borrow a shaman, ask them to slow, land 2 poison dots, and 1 magic dot and see how well your VDD holds up.   <br />
<br />
Not very at all.   Hell to be really honest, as a shaman, I can and do get agro when I go full out on Boss Mobs.  Sure Wizard 004 is droping 3k-8k chain nukes, but no the mob is going to eat my shaman instead.<br />
<br />
The truth is, Agro is more important than many accept in the &quot;tank/mitigation&quot; debate because simply put, other members of the group have to hold back, often significanty, when they have a lower agro tank.  <br />
<br />
in the end, no matter what you do to the monk mitigation, I can guarantee as a shaman I will NEVER pick a monk tank over a Knight or Warrior.    I will be tanking every mob on Incoming as the Monk has no snap agro that can compete against Slow.   And the monk can't sustain enough agro to keep the mob off me.<br />
<br />
Nor can the monk ever snap agro a 2nd add and tank 2.  <br />
<br />
Even if you give a monk its mitigation back, it never ever will be a tank of choice<br />
because of agro.  At least not from the point of view of high agro classes like Shm and Enchanters.<br />
<br />
Speaking of Enchanters: you get an Add, you mezz it.   You mezz it for 30 seconds.<br />
Now WTF is a Monk going to do?   Your going to have to memblur it, unless you want to tank the damn thing forever.</div></div><hr />

My wiz could outdamage you all day and still not get aggro from a monk tank.<br />
<br />
How do I know?<br />
<br />
I routinely tank my ranger who has no problems tanking most grp content in OoW (MPG/RS is albeit tougher). His dps along with procs (max AAs dps/aggro aas for ranja) is more than sufficient to hold down a mob. Is he perfect? Hell no, but given that he can challenge my warrior (DB/CScim anger3 augged with WA5, SoP, etc. etc. etc.) with his dps/procs/aas alone is quit interesting.<br />
<br />
They are often fighting (when warrior tanks) for aggro till 75-80%, assuming warrior doesnt pull a lucky string of procs relative to ranger. Only advantage ranger has is pull aggro.<br />
<br />
And for the record debuffs occassionally pull aggro but less than 5% of time and ranger just as likely to lose as warrior (I cast debuffs 1 sec after first hit with tash/slow coming from chanter/shammy at same time).<br />
<br />
Just because you play a certain way doesnt mean that it cant be done another way.<br />
<br />
GD<br />
<br />
VOTE NO ON MONK MITIGATION UNNERF!!!<br />
<br />
 I also play a ranger.  And a ranger is again an AGRO magnet.   With Flame Lick and Snare, they outagro knights.   <br />
<br />
Im not really sure what point your trying to make here?<br />
<br />
Ranger vs Monk?<br />
Ranger = Snap agro galore<br />
Ranger = Agro lock galore (perhaps more than any class)<br />
<br />
What you seem to be saying is that groups can adjust to a lower agro tank like a monk.   Which is of course true.   I've played with plenty of Monk Tanks and Ranger Tanks.    But by adjusting what that really means is that the whole group has to hold back.   The Wizard for example is Concusioning Twice as much<br />
for the Monk Tank which means the Wizards DPS might be down 20-50%.  <br />
<br />
This kind of &quot;hold back&quot; phenomen is going to be true REGARDLESS of monks mitigation and ability to stand in front of a mob.   And it's going to already be a significant penalty on the group for using a Monk Tank.   And it's going to mean that monks will never be preferred for tank.  So again?  the problem?<br />
<br />
Truthfully, I believe a Monk shoudl be a better tank than a ranger.   they are a pure melee class and bring far less utility to the group than the ranger does ((sound familiar warriors?))  as it is now, they arent.   <br />
<br />
The Agro Advantage of  ranger &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; monk  is far more than any punishment/tanking advantage of monk.    As such, there needs to be a clear advantage for Monk Taking Punishment &gt;&gt;&gt; Rangers to balance out vs Utility/agro.   <br />
<br />
God this sounds so scarily familiar...   Its 100% the same arguement that Warriors use in balance vs Knights.</div></div><hr />

Can you come up with something that holds water? It is an old tired Cliche  ;) <br />
<br />
Why is 30 ac worth more on a warrior? simply because we have had the training with armor to know that if we can not avoid a hit we need to try to brace/posistion ourselves so that our armor takes the blow, not a joint or exposed skin.<br />
.<br />
<br />
Heh, hey let me turn my head just so, because my EARRING has a whopping 30 AC<br />
and as a warrior I know that my earring underneath my helmet will deflect that big nasty blow from exposed skin.   Likewise, I'll take that hit on my 3rd finger because of this neat ring underneath my gauntlets.    <br />
<br />
I'll never get over how people try to justify stuff like that.   Go back to any RPG just about.   Go back to granddady of them all.   D&amp;D.  AC was AC in every RPG I've ever played.    Sure that super low neg 5 AC was far easier to get for Plate Wearers, but once receached, but EQ is the only game Ive seen that tries stuff like that,.</div></div><hr />

If you haven't already figured it out, you will get zero sympathy on this issue.  Many a pop-flopper have come here to change minds with no success.  This thread is no different, and to my knowledge these are all old curve balls everyone here has seen a hundred times before.  You are wasting your time, because quite frankly, everyone here knows (or at least believes) you to be dead wrong.  If you feel you are out of balance then rally for better pulling techniques or more dps/utility.  Mitigation is not and has never been the answer to your problems.  You are not a tank.  You will not and should not tank anywhere close to that of a plate class, and preferably should not even be anywhere near that of a ranger (a class you are already far more powerful than).  Until you change your position on this you will get no support from other eq classes and will subsequently have no changes made to better your situation.  Change your focus and you'll probably win the support of the warrior community.<br />

I wouldn't stereotype :&gt;  I'm a shaman &amp; a druid not a monk and I'd say most casting classes would support Monks.   It's the other melees like War, Knight, Ranger  who throw up and fight against it.<br />
<br />
But explain to me why a Pure Melee Class shoudl tank worse than a Hybrid Casting Class like Ranger.<br />
<br />
You know again, and again, having played this game for years and years,  as casters primarily.   I do get a great kick at this thread from a historical standpoint.<br />
<br />
I would say that almost all the arguements you use against monks were once dead weight around Warrior necks.  Snap Agro in particular.    Hell if same arguements you use were turned against you, you do realize the Incite/Bellow Line should and perhaps would be removed again?   I wonder what would happen if a year from now they put out a patch and removed it and said &quot;Warriors created a balance issue, they were never meant to have snap agro.  It was a test that failed and Im sorry you have had it for years, but we need to remove it.&quot;<br />
<br />
This after all, wouldn't be a nerf ala the Mitigation one right?   This wouldnt gut the class into retirments ala the Mitigation one right?  You wouldnt feel betrayed<br />
and that a role (snap agro) was removed right?  <br />
<br />
Much of the support for the Incite Line sure as heck didnt come from your fellow tanks.   I know for sure Knights didnt support it, and even Rangers hated the Incite Line.   Where did it come from then?   Warriors arguing they needed it to compete with Casting Hybrids and getting support from Casting Classes especially debuffers who were tired of getting beat on with sucky Warrior Tanks.<br />
<br />
The same issues and parallels exist here, whether you want to admit it or not.<br />
Pick up any mirror.   <br />
<br />
Every single arguement used to argue to Warrior Improvements, by warriors with support of casters and argued against by Knights and Rangers apply to Monk.   Gotta admit as a caster it amuses the heck out of me to see a Flip Flop of Kerrying Proportions from so many people.<br />
<br />
&quot;I support the war.&quot;  &quot;I dont support the war&quot;<br />
&quot;I support Pure Melees need more than Hybrids&quot;  &quot;Sorry Monks but Rangers &amp; Knights are more than you.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Here, I'll give it a nudge. Bards are supposed to be the best pullers in the game. Leezard Monks are included only because they die easily and leave nice luggage behaind. The only reason Human Monks exist is so Leezard Monk have someone in the game they can feel superior to.<br />

I was amazed to see such a question as this. The answer is two words, design intention.... just because you're a pure melee, doesn't mean you are or should be a tank. Just as just because you're pure caster, doesn't mean you're a nuker. Or a buffer. Or a healer, or should do ANY of those better than any hybrid, since you're  a pure caster.<br />

Wrong. We required snap aggro to do our job of tanking to bring us in line with the other classes. Monks do not REQUIRE more mitigation to do their job of pulling. Some minor help may be needed, but that can be addressed with other improvements such as run speed, FD improvements, defense from behind (already added, could be improved) and lull (already added).<br />
<br />
The comparison of monk imigation increases to warrior snap aggro improvements is simply comparing apples to oranges. The problem had been in place since Velious, when the dev's acknolwedged the problem and EB weapons were put in the game as a TEMPORARY solution. It took until PoP or GoD for the problem to actually have a permanent solution. The same can CERTAINLY not be said for monk mitigation improvements being called for by monks.</div></div><hr />

If anything is apples and oranges its your 20-20 Hindsight rewrite of history of the game.<br />
<br />
Warriors DIDNT require Snap Agro.   I used many many warrior tanks over the years without Snap Agro.  Sure it was harder, and group had to hold back ((the whole dont start nuking to 80 mentality)) but it was doable not required<br />
<br />
And if you go back to any knight and ranger board.  You will see plenty of arguements that Knights were supposed to be better XP group tanks than warriors.   It wasn't until the last year or so that Warriors &gt; Knights in xp groups.<br />
<br />
The original vision was warriors dominate on raids (hail defensive) and Knights<br />
place was to be the best tanks in groups.<br />
<br />
None of the warrior improvements were liked or supported by the knights.<br />
In fact much of it was argued that Warriors &gt; Knights in all forms of tanking because of the fact that Warriors were pure melees and thats what they did/should do.     But thats a recent phenomen in the game not a historical one.<br />
<br />
((its one I agree with btw.   I think that warriors were one of the classes in need of the most improvement.   And Anger Augs and Incite Line were essential and needed.   However, I still maintain as an outsider to both classes that Monks are now the warriors of a year ago.  Sadly undervalued.   Probably the single most undervalued class now in the game.))</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I've of course stopped playing EQ, so my perspective could very well be behind the times.  But when I played, I indeed felt lucky.  I felt lucky when I could find a half assed decent group that didn't include a Knight, Ranger, or many times a Monk, who felt like they had to show how uber they were by routinely stealing aggro and then, many times, crowing about it and rubbing my nose in the fact that taunt's success rate sucks ass.<br />
<br />
I indeed felt lucky in PoP when I could occassionally keep a slower alive through an entire playing session even though I had worked hard on improving my character through expansion after expansion, even if my progress was not uber guild caliber, because normally grouping with me was basically a death sentence, sooner or later, for any slow casting character.<br />
<br />
I indeed felt lucky that not only was I being passed up by pick up groups as a Warrior in PoP and LDoN, but frequently even by guildmates.  Guildmates that weren't just passing on me, but on all but the very best geared of the guild Warriors.<br />
<br />
I indeed felt lucky when I could occassionally find a light blue that I could solo that wouldn't beat the ever loving bejesus out of me or out right kill me before I could manage to finish it off.   And this became pretty impossible as new expansions were released.<br />
<br />
I indeed felt lucky  when I and other Warriors fought and argued for close to 18 months for some kind of additional aggro generation beyond damage output, taunt, and procs that were only available on exceedingly rare weapons that frequently reduced our DPS in exchange marginal aggro generation.  I can still hear the cries from the Knights that no one would ever use a Knight as a tank again if Warriors could actually perform their role in the game half way decently.  Because of course Knights were the only tanks intended to actually be reasonably functional.<br />
<br />
I indeed felt lucky when I somehow or other managed to escape near certain death because of an unexpected encounter while alone, when my group was inadvertantly trained, or something else unexpected occured where escaping was the better part of valor, while the Monks simply pushed a button and most of the time got away without a scratch.<br />
<br />
Yeah, I felt lucky when I played EQ.   Really lucky.  Which of course is why I stopped playing EQ.  Because when luck begins to be the primary factor in success or failure and being a competent player is only a secondary consideration, that's the time when I know that being lucky just isn't consistant enough to be fun.</div></div><hr />

Who are these mystical 'they'? You have an entire thread of people telling you you're wrong.<br />
There is no such thing as 'too much agro' on your tank weapon setup. Sure for pussy party members who cast a spell every minute, yeah, there is, but if you play at that level your points arent relevant.<br />
Your comment about dps/agro shows you are very poorly informed, and have no clue as to the main reason agro augs are used. (Hint for feebleminded: it's not because of total agro production.) Back to school.<br />

No one can question the lobbying that Frodlin does on behalf of the warrior community, even if it results in a worse game for other classes (Shadow Knights, Paladins, and Monks come to mind).<br />

No your holding back.  Im doing a lot more DPS than you.<br />
<br />
I haven't cast a Disease Dot in forever.   Im landing Bane at 420 a Tic, and Blood at 320 and often nuking (even chain nuking) or throwing 2 poison dots or 2 magic dots throwing in Cripples on certain types of mobs (flurries/rampagers).    Using Pained Memories, Can5, Horse, so I have tons of mana.   I also tend to use balance on incoming or malos followed by TA to elimite recast delay.<br />
<br />
With what you say you do with your shaman, Im not surprised your warriors agro<br />
is sufficient.  But you are pumping out probably less than half the agro I am.<br />
Landing Malos, then Slow, then 1 High Agro Dot, then 1-2 tiny agro things.<br />
While I'm Landing 2-4 High Agro Dots, Landing Slow 2-5 Seconds faster than you<br />
((Malos/TA or Balance)) <br />
<br />
Thats exactly what I mean about Agro is relative and others have to hold back<br />
to match the tanks agro.    VDD is good agro but its not enough for an actively<br />

<br />
Load up Bane, Poison Blood, and Even your 56 Poison Dot.   Land those 3 on a mob and see what happens.    Test it for yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">11-16-2004, 02:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No exaggeration on my part.  All that content exists today, but groups are so trained they don't go to those spots that need a puller.  <br />
<br />
PoEarth has spots that need some type of puller/mezzer/kiter and yet you can get single mobs all day long.  PoFire is singles all day long.  So is PoWater.  Vxed and Tipt are mostly singles but a mezzer or kiter is sufficient for the few spots that are not single and when a puller is not available.  Kod'Taz has many temple areas where a puller is needed but experience groups don't go there.  Yxtta and Qvic have areas with nothing but singles and groups stick to those rather than hunt in places where a puller is needed.  They stick to the wide open fields of roamers where singles are easy to pick off.  WoS is all singles except for raid targets.  MPG is all singles except for a few circle rooms with 3 mobs in aggro range but groups don't touch those.  Groups stay at the Taskfiend, Blind, or Odium camp.  Riftseekers is all singles as well (the parts I have been to).  All it takes is someone half attentive to watch out for roamers...<br />
<br />
So, in summation, yes, there are locations where a puller is wanted and even needed.  However, groups don't go there.  I maintain that unless EVERY location and EVERY situation requires a puller, then groups will just migrate to the areas where no puller is needed.  If groups just migrate to the area where no puller is needed, then pulling will never be a primary ability.  Urging for more pulling content is pointless unless you go all the way and urge for nothing but pulling content.  And as I said before, that will not happen, so it is not a viable solution.<br />
<br />
Sear<br />
Five Rings<br />
<br />
If, as you say, that no one goes to these places that require a puller, does this not suggest to you that maybe rewards for these area could be tuned up to encourage people to go there?  People will go to places if they want something from them, and if the easiest way to get it is to include a puller in your group, well then pullers will get more groups.  The logic you used to exagerate what I say is faulty, and you then argued against this faulty exageration.  Again, I repeat, this is not the only possible solution for monks, or even the best(as there are certainly potential problems with the idea I suggest).  But if I can think of something to help monk group desirability that does not involve repealing the mitigation nerf, then many others can as well, and there are some bright people around.<br />
<br />
If discussion like the bard AE DoT kiting nerf discussion took place so many years ago<br />
<br />
It is too bad that it took so long for the open lines of communication to develop between Dev's and players.  I really wish it had started much sooner(maybe the PoP era where warriors had such a rough time would not have happened).<br />
<br />
But explain to me why a Pure Melee Class shoudl tank worse than a Hybrid Casting Class like Ranger.<br />
<br />
Because rangers, like knights, are part warrior(the parent tank class).  They are, be design, tank classes, monks are not.<br />

If a monk using a VDD with an agro aug(ykesha) is not generating enough agro for you, 80 %(at least) of warriors in EQ are not going to as well.  VDD is better agro than pretty much anything a casual, non raid warrior has access to.  Note that casual/non raid shaman who are going to be grouping with these warriors most likely have lower regen, lower mana regen, fewer hp's and other toys...and are therefore going to be doing correspondingly less DPS.  In fact, most non raid/casual shaman do not have Balance, which as you point out, slows down the amount of DPS they can do alone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've been told VDD is stronger aggro than a BoWar.  I know SoTrancendance is stronger aggro than a VDD.   You do the math, there are several weapons at all levels of the game a monk can use if he/she/it wants to hold aggro, and given weapon affinity 5 and ldon augments, they can do so better than all but the very best pre-LDoN warriors could possibly dream of.<br />
<br />
Pre LDoN warrior DBoTWL + EoE:<br />
2.5-3 anger procs a minute = ~3khate<br />
1 stun proc a minute = 450 hate/min<br />
Total= 3500ish hate<br />
<br />
Pre LDoN warrior BoWar:<br />
2 EB procs a minute= 1400 hate/min<br />
<br />
Pre LDoN warrior BF + HG<br />
4 EB procs a minute= 2800 hate<br />
<br />
Current SoTrancendance + yak hate + WA5 =<br />
Superior dps aggro<br />
3 stun procs a minute innate = 1500<br />
3 stun procs a minute = 1500<br />
Total= 3000+ hate/min from procs + some extra dps aggro.<br />
<br />
Warriors made do back in the day just fine and dandy with the right tools.  True, you'll never be able to hold aggro quite like a tanking class ... but then again you aren't intended too either.  If you're not endgame and want an aggro setup go get yourself a pair of SoD's ... or a CHoS ... or hell evenone of them old stun clubs and yak aug em.  9 stuns a minute = 4500 raw aggro before dps aggro is factored in.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Revisionist history? Not likely.<br />
<br />
You're right. they DIDN'T require snap aggro. But that's the operative word there, they DIDN'T require snap aggro up to PoP. <br />
<br />
Once PoP came out with the mobs that hit a ton harder than they ever had before, snap aggro became a necessity, as the mobs hit hard enough to severely or hurt casters. Casters that were getting aggro got really sick and tired of getting beat on, and so they started to choose classes that were good at snap aggro... knights. This is why the snap aggro issue BECAME an issue.<br />
<br />
The original vision was warriors dominate on raids (hail defensive) and Knights<br />
place was to be the best tanks in groups.<br />
You say that like it was the EQ Developer's vision of the game. That's not necessarily the case... in fact it sounds a lot more like the KNIGHT'S vision, not warriors, the rest of the community, or the dev's.<br />
<br />
None of the warrior improvements were liked or supported by the knights.<br />
In fact much of it was argued that Warriors &gt; Knights in all forms of tanking because of the fact that Warriors were pure melees and thats what they did/should do.     But thats a recent phenomen in the game not a historical one.<br />
<br />
It's an expected reaction. Classes who are in direct competition with each other for a role are never happy to see their competitors get an upgrade, as it gives the competition a leg up.<br />
<br />
 However, I still maintain as an outsider to both classes that Monks are now the warriors of a year ago.  Sadly undervalued.   Probably the single most undervalued class now in the game.))<br />
<br />
I agree, to an extent, to this statement. If reasonable non mitigation improvements were suggested to monks to improve their DPS or pulling role (the traditional role of monks), I would more than likely support them. But there's no way I'll support a mitigation increase. It's just not necessarily needed to improve the class, and has the potential to do far more harm than good.</div></div><hr />

It's not accessible to bazaar level monk.  So why are you saying a VDD Time Geared Monk can hold agro from lesser shm/wars?<br />

<br />
<br />
CHoS - yes<br />
SoD - no<br />
<br />
Sure SoDs are droppable, but even on my server (Xev), the last of the blue servers that was around when Velious went live to kill the sleeper, the server with probably the second most SoDs (second only to RZ), SoDs are just about never for sale and go for 250-350k.  I'd imagine somebody on one of the servers that has less than 10 SoDs would find them significantly harder to come by...<br />
<br />
...but ultimately it comes back to my origianl point in my very first post.  I'll quote Daemondwynd because he said it best:<br />
Once PoP came out with the mobs that hit a ton harder than they ever had before, snap aggro became a necessity, as the mobs hit hard enough to severely or hurt casters. Casters that were getting aggro got really sick and tired of getting beat on, and so they started to choose classes that were good at snap aggro... knights. This is why the snap aggro issue BECAME an issue.<br />
Becasue of that monks will never be as good at tanking or even get serious consideration as a tank from any group that isn't desperate.  I just don't understand why warriors are so opposed to it.  I don't understand what warriors feel they will lose.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
P.S. - Just as an extra note, if you read my posts over at the EQLive board, you'll see that I'm not even a mitigation fan boy, I do suggest other monk improvements (I've even had an alternate improvements thread stickied there for many months).  I don't however consider better pulling anything that will help us out much.  I have a level 70 cleric &quot;alt&quot; that I play when I don't want to go lfg with my level 68 monk &quot;main&quot; so I know what it's like in a group without a monk.  I know what it's like with all kinds of classes pulling.  Pulling is just so efficient these days by several classes (with smart players) that unless monks are given a reverse Call of the MOB ability that doesn't aggro it's friends, there is no room to improve their efficiency to the point that it will make a difference, and even bards with selos and FM get hit while pulling in OoW (and probably GoD, but I haven't been there much) so faster monk run speed (even to selos) will only help just as much as mitigation.  Likewise, our potential dps increase is capped by rogue dps since rogues have virtually zero to offer other than dps.  Selo speed (possibley tied to low weight) + improved dps to be near rogues would make me happy, but I think mitigation would help me get a group just as much, infinge on other classes less, and is more likely to be implemented than the combination of what I mentioned above.<br />
<br />
P.P.S. - Saying a monk in Anguish gear shouldn't tank better than a monk in Elemental gear becasue &quot;they aren't a tank&quot; is like saying a warrior in Anguish gear shouldn't out dps a monk in Elemental gear because they aren't a dps class.  I suppose it's a matter of opinion (as all class roles are), but I'm pretty sure an unbiased outsider (ie nobody in this thread) would find it a bit rediculous one way or the other.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes they will be expensive, but then again so are the top-dop buyables for warriors.  Next to BoC/SoD, CHoS are the next best pre-OoW buyables for aggro.  As i'm sure you already know CHoS's are a staple for aggro that most warriors use till they can find raid quality aggro weapons.<br />
<br />
In the end, though SoD's are only marginally better aggro weapons than the CHoS ... slightly more dps aggro and slightly more aggro per proc (although not a whole lot more).<br />
<br />
Monks have always been and will continue to be aggro magnets ... enough so that any group of roughly equivalent players can get by decently well with a monk tanking (assuming the mobs are not at the extreme threshold for the group of players gear-wise in which case a tank is a must).  Before i had duel anger3's, WA5, and my current weaponsetup monks in my guild could steal my aggro without trying too hard thanks to superior ratio's alone.  If said monks were to go the extra mile and aug with yaks it would have been really ugly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's extremely simple logic.  First off, in the past Monks have taken tank spots away from Warriors.  It's a fact, it happened.  So to say that it could never happen is to reject what history has already shown to be true, it can in fact happen if the circumstances are right.<br />
<br />
Secondly, if you feel that even with a mitigation improvement you will never in a million years ever get a tank spot, then what good does the mitigation improvement do you?  Monks claim it's to improve pulling, yet reject out of hand numerous suggestions for improving pulling without a mitigation change.  So obviously it's not just to improve pulling, or you'd settle for other tools.<br />
<br />
And finally, Monks claim it's to improve their survivability in general.  Well that's dandy.  Every class would like to improve their survivability.  Chanters pull with lower mitigation than Monks, I bet they'd love a mitigation increase.  Rangers pull with somewhat similar mitigation to Monks, I bet they'd love a mitigation increase.  Every class in the game can and does pull under at least some circumstances, should they all get a mitigation increase so as to improve their general survivability?  Obviously not.  So why are Monks special?  Because they've bitched about it for the last 2 and a half years?  I don't think so.<br />
<br />
If you want to improve your pulling, settle for tools that aren't a mitigation increase.  If you don't want to be a tank, then accept that you're not getting a mitigation increase.  If you feel like you need a general survivability increase, then consider the many classes in the game that can't just fall to the ground when things go wrong and have the bad guys completely ignore them.  Monks are one of the most survivable classes in the game already.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry, but your missing his point.   <br />
Your saying in the Past Monks took Tanks Slots from Warriors.<br />
This was a FLUKE of a BROKEN Past for multiple reasons non of which still exist.<br />
Ergo, Monks wouldn't be taking  tank jobs now.<br />
<br />
1) Snap Agro<br />
<br />
in the past, neither class War/Monk had snap agro.<br />
in the past, snap agro wasn't a huge deal<br />
<br />
currently, warriors have snap agro<br />
currently, groups need snap agro with yard trash that hits 600 to 1400 and named that can hit 2k+ in zones as low as WOS.<br />
<br />
Result: monks won't take jobs<br />
<br />
2) Pathetically Low AC Soft Caps<br />
<br />
in the past, due to all/all gear Monk AC was close to Warrior AC<br />
in the past, due to Low Soft Caps Monks AC &amp; War AC was both way above the soft cap, creating no virtual difference in Mitigation.<br />
<br />
currently, AC matters.   even if you unnerf Monk AC to be normal AC.  There is a definite difference between equally geared monk/war.   War will ahve 600 to 1000 more AC, and as a result mitigate far better.<br />
<br />
3) Fungi was King due to Low Mob DPS<br />
<br />
in the past, most non-monk melees (war inc) were plain stupid.   The single best BP in the game for a warrior in Luclin was the Fungi Tunic, not the Vindi, Erad, etc.<br />
Because even wearing the fungi, the warrior would still have been above the soft cap.   As such 15 Regen &gt;&gt;&gt; 100 hps when it came to healing in xp groups.<br />
<br />
in the past, monks tanked better (needed less healing) because monks didn't have as many BP options so tended to go for the fungi.   A lot of the difference<br />
in tanking was a result of the 15 regen.<br />
<br />
currently: 15 regen means squat.<br />
<br />
For all 3 reasons, monks will never again approach taking tanking jobs from warriors.  even if they get thier unnerf.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wow, I think a lot of warriors are missing this point, or would like to hide from it.<br />
<br />
Logic:<br />
War = Tank Class.    Monk = Non Tank Class<br />
So even an elemental warrior &gt; anguish monk<br />
<br />
Same Logic<br />
Monk = DPS Class.   War = Non DPS Class<br />
So even an elemental monk &gt; anguish warrior.<br />
<br />
Fairs fair, right?<br />
You realize this support for a monk mitigation nerf could well imply a DPS nerf of Warriors ((and then knights who would have to be nerfed below warrior))?<br />
<br />
So no matter what weapons in Anguish/Omens/Tac/etc....  a warrior should never do better DPS than a Monk with say a Staff from POF or Sol ro?  or dual wielding 18/20 HtHs?<br />
<br />
Also same needs to apply to AAs.   OF courses it is obscene to think that a monk with all 2/4/6*2 Arch, 3/6/9*2 Luclin, 5,5,5,5,5*2 Omens = 24+36+50=106 defensive AAs should come too close to a warrior with Zero.<br />
<br />
So likewise, a Warrior with all offensive AAs should do less than a monk with zero?<br />
<br />
---------------------------<br />
<br />
Truth is, monks needed the nerf back in Luclin and before.    But the game has elvoved and fixed all the problems that required the nerf through Itemization.<br />
<br />
Monk AC and War AC too close<br />
--- Problem: Fixed.   They arent anymore<br />
<br />
Both Monk AC and War AC were both over softcaps making zero difference<br />
--- Problem: Fixed.  Even warriors arent generally over the soft cap and no monk<br />
will ever get close to it.<br />
<br />
Low DPS mobs that made regen more important than HPs for tanking<br />
--- Problem: Fixed.<br />
<br />
There's really no reason left for monks to mitigate on a seperate table outside of thier AC.  a 1600 - 2000  AC monk should mitigate 1600 - 2000 AC worth, not <br />
a pathetic 1300ish AC where they appear capped.</div></div><hr />

Monks and Rogues aren't Tanks. They will not be able to combine high melee DPS and tanking.<br />
<br />
The top Monk killers:<br />
Failed FD<br />
Nuke damage/heavy DoT's<br />
Mobs summoning<br />
<br />
coupled with getting snared or rooted.<br />
<br />
Melee mitigation doesn't make the list. Monks can do heavy damage for a melee and this is offset by the fact that if they get too carried away they can get aggro and since this is not desirable for long - they FD and lose DPS. Like Rogues, they have a way to get rid of aggro, not a way to stand there and take the heat, nay to welcome it.<br />
<br />
None of the high melee DPS classes handle melee damage very well. That's what not being able to be a Tank is.<br />

<br />
BB<br />
<br />
I agree with this in theory 100%.    But I also apply it both ways.<br />
<br />
Pre-POP, when AC didnt matter Monks did need reigning in.<br />
Now a days, I still dont see why a Monk with 1600 (Timeish) to 2k (Anguish) AC<br />
should mitigate like a 1300 AC Monk (preelemental).<br />
<br />
Warriors DPS is pretty damn impressive too.   Perhaps they need the same reigning in.  So that a Warrior with a Matchless Silvery Claymore can't do more damage than a Warrior With a Windblade.<br />
<br />
After all, warriors aren't dps, they will not be able to combine tanking with high melee DPS.?<br />
<br />
The whole Monk Mitigation Debate boils down to the Fact that Monks seem to have an AC Cap of 1300ish.<br />
<br />
While they have an Equipment Based AC of up to 2k at highest end of gear.<br />
<br />
No one is saying Monks should get warrior mitigation.  Thats impossible.  Any warrior worth a damn is going to have 600+ more AC than monks in thier guild.<br />
<br />
All that is said, is that monks should be able to get the mitigation that raiding has earned them through AC instead of hard capping it at 1300.<br />
<br />
Does that mean that an Anguish Monk of 2000 AC can mitigate as well as a Elemental Warrior of 2000 AC.  Sure.   But even then they wont tank as well <br />
due to Agro Issues.   Just like Im sure an Anguish Warrior does DPS equal or better to a Monk of Elemental level.<br />
<br />
Let Gear be Gear be Gear.    <br />
The reason for the Nerf:  All/All Similiar AC items across Leather/Plate divide and Low Mob Attacks so High AC was softcapped are both long gone.   The Nerf Should be too.</div></div><hr />

 Because (for the eighteen millionth time) mitigation ain't your thing, avoidance is. And your avoidance ability for a Time/Anguish monk is lightyears beyond the avoidance of a pre EP monk.<br />
<br />
 You're not going to get mitigation boosts, Sony has said that. Quit tilting at the windmills.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Crap Logic Sorry.<br />
Again, apply your logic to your own class and see how it holds up.<br />
<br />
So as Time/Anguish Warrior, your shielding is lightyears beyond the shielding of a pre-EP warrior.   As such, the fact that your AC is capped at the same level<br />
wouldnt matter?<br />
<br />
So if Warrior AC was soft-capped at about 1700, leaving shielding as the only upgrade method, could you imagine how much less fun the game would be?<br />
That if you prooved your 2800 AC was meaningless?<br />
<br />
Part of what keeps EQ1 going, is the perpetual drive to improve your char.<br />
Look in Overlords Sanctuary and other forums here about how the drive to AC<br />
numbers and pride and camping AC, all plays a huge part of why people keep playing.<br />
<br />
Yet of all melee classes, only the monk really seems artificially capped at numbers attainable 3-4 expansions ago.<br />
<br />
The reason so many monks have been lost to retirement, is largely based on the mitigation nerf and artificial AC cap of 1300 AC that renders one of the major categories of judging improvment gone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nor do I care if there is sympathy for Monks, or from warriors because Im a third party spectator totally unaffected by the debate.<br />
<br />
What intrigues me about this debate is how utterly hypocritical more warriors are on this issue, and how bad the logic used in arguements.   If the same arguments were applied to warriors,<br />
<br />
in fact if you took most of the warrior posts here, and simply cut out words like &quot;Monk&quot; and &quot;Tank&quot;  and turned them in to sony for evaluation with words like &quot;Warrior&quot; and &quot;DPS&quot;  you would nerf yourselves into oblivion.<br />
<br />
or the fact, that every anti-monk arguement proposed, was once used by knights in an anti-warrior turn ((snap agro))<br />
<br />
or the fact, that from a historical perspective you'd be much worse off as a class<br />
if you went by previous views of class.  ((warriors not being xp tank of choice cause they were raid tanks for example))<br />
<br />
Anyway...   <br />
Back to the point, lets see more examples of hypocritcal logic:<br />
DPS classes shouldnt benefit from AC improvements because they are not Tank Classes.<br />
<br />
Okay<br />
Tank classes shouldnt benefit from DPS improvements like Strikethrough, ferocity, and cleave, because they are not a DPS class right?<br />

So you claim.  Which is nice and all.  But doesn't reassure Warriors that you're right.  All you are expressing is an opinion.  Obviously not one shared by everyone.  So if Warriors don't agree with your opinion, then it really should come as no surprise that they're not willing to risk you being wrong.  After all, you wouldn't be the one standing around with your thumb up your ass groupless because of it, now would you?</div></div><hr />
