<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>brutall</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">With the guild summit we saw the creation of a message board designed operated and paid for by SOE.  <br />
<br />
This board allowed people who attended the summit to have faster access to candid developer discussions which can include confirmation of bugs,  bug fixes/non fixes and also discussions on game play.  While more information is usually better these boards with all of the collective information within remain closed to the public.<br />
<br />
While certain people being privy to information may not be something totally new to EQ we have not seen a board set up and ran by soe facilitating the transfer exclusive information from developers to a few selected guild leaders until now.<br />
<br />
Next SOE extended beta invites for entire guilds in order to test content with a group that is used to working together.  From my understanding being a summit guild is a prerequisite to be a part of this testing if not the only determining factor.  <br />
<br />
We have guilds leaders being given information by developers that nobody else has access to and then giving the exact same individuals exclusive access to beta testing raid content.<br />
<br />
It's a real blow to the fun factor for me,  I enjoy competing with guilds on my server and on other servers.  Knowing certain people for what ever reason have access to better, faster, and exclusive information via SOE developers really affects this.  I know some of you may think this to be very petty on my part and say &quot;if you don't like it, don't play&quot; but I love this game and hate to see it tarnished by irresponsible community managers.<br />
<br />
I've brought this up to brenlo and not only did he seem to not care, he locked my thead on the eqlive forums.  <br />
<br />
Here is what a community Representative, with access to the forums, had to say about this matter-<br />
SOE doesn't care about everyone being equally informed.... some folks are on the &quot;in&quot; and some aren'tSwampfunk<br />
<br />
<br />
I posted this here because it effects every high end guild in the game.<br />
<br />
<br />
here (http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Veterans&amp;message.id=19927&amp;view=by_date_ascending&amp;page=1) is the thread that was locked by brenlo.<br />
<br />
I don't post this to cry or whine about it but to inform everyone that this activity is going on and that it is sponsored by SOE.  I'm sure I'll be attacked for saying it and nobody will have my back,  but I do care about the game and about keeping it fair.</div></div><hr />

Sure if they couldn't afford for a euro member to go there we could've sent one of our american members.. But well, I guess we should be used to getting the shaft on AB.

It's an unfortunate fact of life that some players and guilds have more access to information than others. IMO in some cases this advance access has been used to create an advantage that would not have otherwise existed.<br />
<br />
But SoE isn't about to hire 500 beta testers and pay them to acquire expertise playing EQ.<br />
<br />
It isn't a battle you are going to win.<br />
<br />
Inferna,<br />
Yes, but I understand player Beta testers don't get to see or test everthing. In some cases they MAY even be able to identify a method of beating an encounter that wasn't intended and wasn't reported. This COULD allow them to easily beat an almost impossible encounter within weeks of release with SoE dutifully closing the barn door and patching after they advance. In two cases, I believe either Verant or SoE took this potential advantage away or prevented the guild from suceeding before the encounter was patched.<br />

My guilds not euro but we are the #1 guild on our server and have been since the day the server opened, yet a different guild got invited to the summit and supposedly OoW beta simply because Moorgard works for SoE now and that was his previous guild. Talk about suck, hes not even on the EQ1 team, I hope to god we dont end up on the same server in EQ2.<br />

In defense of any sekret boards though, you cant have calm, concise, rational discussions with 100k people contributing, its just simply impossible, especially since being a dick or a rebel is considered cool on the interweb. A lot of posts get lost and not read simply because of the volume of posters vs. the developers also.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can appreciate those reasons and add a few more on why they shouldn't let anyone post, I think read only access is a viable option.  <br />
<br />
They have certain guilds who were invited to the summit and have a forum with exclusive access.  Then give those same guilds access to beta, this would lead one to believe that the summit forum will inevitably turn in to beta type board.  If this is the case then limited participation in beta won't matter because access to much more information will be available via the summit forum/beta board.<br />
<br />
It would seem to me that instead of inviting summit guilds they would want to do just the opposite and say &quot;you participated with the summit so we can't invite you to beta test.&quot;  I'm not understanding why selected guilds are getting the preferred treatment over and over again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ciae Redemption</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">FoH sold out and Afterlife quit, so Sony gave the leet beta infoz to someone else. The only difference here is that it's actually confirmed by Sony.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Timmok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Brutall:<br />
<br />
I agree 100%. A read-only version of the board would be nice.<br />
<br />
But I can also understand why they dont do it, at that being because people would start threads on the other boards, discussings the very threads on the summit board.<br />
<br />
And personally I dont even think that the summit board is the &quot;worst&quot; when it comes to inside information. <br />
<br />
Plenty of guilds apparently have direct communication with devs, and basically know when and what changes will be pushed live to the endgame zones. This does constitute a competitive advantage, because it allows them better to schedule their time/raid days.<br />
<br />
Let me give you an example:<br />
<br />
Before the recent Inktuta patch I was talking to someone on another server that had basically a run down list of all the exact changes that would occur to the Inktuta encounter BEFORE they went in: from the new minimum amount of people required to be near exiles, to very specific and detailed information about the changes to the final Noqufiel encounter, in particularly information about the fake version becoming stationary and stop summoning when it is about to explode. And that players would have 5 seconds to move away to avoid the explosion damage. That is the kind of information it otherwise might have taken a raid or two to notice.<br />
<br />
I dont know the origin of that information, wether it was from summit board or leaked to a guild, but I do know that at the time it was hugely valuable at least for me, since I then could stop scheduling inktuta raids knowing that the &quot;toned down&quot; version would be going live with next weeks patch.<br />
<br />
So basically there are 2 types of competitive advantages you can get:<br />
<br />
A) Knowing when patches/changes to zone go live, allows you to make more effective use of your raiding time, than guilds that are not privvy to such information<br />
<br />
and<br />
<br />
B) In the case of very specific encounter information such as the above, you can formulate a tactic for dealing with the encounter before even having seen the changes.<br />
<br />
Personally I think A) should be information privvy to all. It was good how Rashere gave public notice on the eqlive section when the Tacvi zone was patched, this is the way to do it. I think they should extend that concept, and maybe make an area of the board where they can also post when minor zone patches go in.<br />
<br />
Information of type B) I dont EVER think anyone should be given. It should be enough to state that a zone is being patched, nobody outside SOE should need a spoiler list of the exact changes before they go live.<br />
<br />
But generally speaking its a balance act. I think its cool that devs talk with players through summit boards and other forms of communication. They just have to be aware what kind of information they share, and not go overboard with details(and if they do, it should be on a public forum where it is for all to see).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Brenlo locking that post was a smart thing to do.<br />
<br />
Having summit forum access does not accelerate or cheat the progression of any guild with that knowledge. It is simply used to communicate changes created by the devs and the receiving of feedback of said changes and/or results by the guildleaders. Making it read-only would negate that. There is no preferred treatment.<br />
<br />
Denying beta would be shooting themselves in the foot. Since there is already a line of communication, its better to keep that one than instead of making multiple ones. People are going to learn the new content in beta. You can't have a beta without learning it. What do you think will happen when WoW beta is finished and the game goes live?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Paen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Even if they did open the boards to read only then 1000's of people would bitch about paying the same amount of money per month and not being treated equally etc.. so then they would either have to open them to everyone or shut them down totally. Both would be bad, if they opened them up then it would turn into a shitfest and if they closed them down players as a whole would lose the only direct link they have with some of the only people who care what we think.<br />
<br />
I dont have access to the beta boards or the summit boards but I know they exist, and I'm glad they do. Would I like to have access? sure, but not at the expense of having every jackass that plays EQ get access also. Keep them closed imo, only good things come from them.<br />
<br />
I also agree with Timmok that any finalized changes should be publically posted and not privy to an elite few though, feedback and discussions are fine in private but information that would save guilds time and trouble should be public.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think this will blow over rather quickly as SoE won't &quot;defend&quot; itself on this issue and guilds with the access believe that they deserve the access.<br />
<br />
There is one interesting way of testing the fairness of the situation however - each release, rotate 25% of the participants out of Beta testing, and put other guilds from their servers into Beta testing. If no one currently Beta testing objects, then it's not the major advantage we imagine. If SoE were to impliment such a program, then it would be percieved as being a relatively fair system and not favortism.<br />
<br />
Oh, I'm not suggesting players should push for this. But I am insisting that turn about is fair play. If there are no major advantages gained by Beta testing and SoE doesn't play favorites, then the suggestion above wouldn't be objected to by anyone.<br />

Sometimes I want to just throw my hands up and say fuckit all. what would make you happy? That you were in beta? Pretty greedy there. BETAS ARE NOT SNEAK PEAKS AT GAMES. Other games (You know who) have tried this route and it simply is not as in debth. Nowadays people are more interested in getting &quot;leet beta infoz&quot; before the game  is released.<br />
<br />
Just a few things to keep in mind:<br />
<br />
1 we will be in the PoK, and ported directly to where we need to go<br />
2. we will be ported back to the Pok when it's finished.<br />
3. They are going to attempt to use placeholder names/ae names so that spoilder information is not givent out.<br />
<br />
EVERYONE on the summit board agreed that the spoiler-potential was far too high for our likeing, and thus it was changed.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">the pb is that : <br />
1. the original post is on given or not reading access to more poeple at the guild submit forum.<br />
2. the Beta testing by few lucky person makes jalous other that could/should have been there too.<br />
<br />
On the #1 I would say that the best thing would be to divide the forum on the different 'locked' zones, and give read access to peaple that can get in this zone (have the flag), and write access to their guild officier (public raid being desavantaged by the fact they don't have guilds thus no guild leaders). <br />
so that everebody that can face a bug, either because it hasn't been discovered, either because it isn't patched yet, will know that there is a pb and the progression to its correction(including date of patch). <br />
if Guild_01 is ported in beta zone_01-&gt;05 and guild_02 to zone_05-&gt;10 they won't know info from these other zones (this help even futher the ask for no spoiler). and they would both be able to comment on new abilities (AA, spells, disc, ...) without the intervention of non-tester. <br />
but this would be too heavy to implement so it won't be. <br />
the best would even be to add a forum in game (a forum not a channel) so that it would be accessible directly from the game, and it would to easier to use the keys and flags system to limit access to some part of the forum. doing this, evereboby could be able to access them if they  match the requierement and not just if there were chosed by SoE. (but there is still the read only / write allowed limitation so that it's less likely to turn into flaming contest).<br />
<br />
on the #2, the fact they choosed arbitrary (at least it seams to) who will be part of guild submit and who will be part of beta testing team. I aggree that if they don't use all the uber guild across all server, they should at least establish a rotation like for mobs :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Solanthious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">the Beta testing by few lucky person makes jalous other that could/should have been there too. <br />
<br />
Wrong. One of SoE's biggest mistakes was making the previous beta's open, and the casual player base testing raid content / raid level zones, or zones they will will only see after they have been nerfed to shit.<br />
<br />
Seriously, the people that play this game for their own personal enjoyment, 1-2 hours a day should &quot;not&quot; be testing the content, the very reason we (the upper end player base) play the game for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Lopeclaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">My view on this is rather simple.  Using the guild sumit folks to do the raid testing for upper tier content is how it should be.  No I am not one of those lucky few but will greatly enjoy the game more because of it.  The new content will actually be tested by people that know what they are doing and monitored by SoE to actually fix things early vice later on.  <br />

<br />
I think giving the same guilds access to exclusive beta information and all the information that is contained in the summit forums is wrong.  Their are many guilds with txevu access and taciv access that were not invited to the summit,  they more than qualify as competient to test things as a group.  I see no reason to extend more privledge to guilds who already have a leg up from the forums.</div></div><hr />

I'm sure they'll do a dandy job.. hell they are retesting the end zones of GOD still 6 months after release.  :rolleyes:  :rolleyes:  :rolleyes:   :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

It is simply used to communicate changes created by the devs and the receiving of feedback of said changes and/or results by the guildleaders. Making it read-only would negate that. There is no preferred treatment. <br />
<br />
Let me give you a hypothetical example of how this can be an advantage.  Lets say I'm not in txevu but I'm part of the summit forums(yes their are guilds like this).  Next the devloper &quot;communicates a change created by the dev&quot; such as &quot;we made some changes to the light switch on the high priest encounter.&quot;  Now A guild not in txevu already not only knows that their is a llightswitch, but that this switch has something critical to do with the encounter.<br />
<br />
This alone can save 1000's of man hours.</div></div><hr />

Figuring out the light switch on their own would not take that long at all, even by going in blind, or doing research and speaking with other guilds who are/have doing the encounter. Thousands of man hours is bull.<br />
<br />
To invite everyone in the high-end game would cause exactly what has happened with a forum with the entire community. But if they invited everyone, where would they draw the line at &quot;high-end&quot;? Uqua? Inktu? Qvic? Txevu? If SOE drew the line at progression_y, you'd have a bunch of guilds that would say &quot;Hey, we are only a week away from that, and we don't get in when we'll be in the same boat as guild_x ahead of us wah wah wah.&quot; What was their method for selecting these guilds? I have no idea. But if you had listened to Apostate on the EQLive forum, you'd know that there isn't that much of a difference in the progression race. Period.<br />
<br />
You say that second-hand information is just a hand-me-down of info being posted with relevant information being held back by the greedy guild and forum leaders with the intent of using said information for themselves... but that isn't happening at all.<br />
<br />
Bottom line: SOE creates a way to effectively communicate the changes made to EQ by conversing with a select group high-end guildleaders and forum leaders. People who obviously spend alot of time invested into EQ. These people have better methods to effectively communicate what they know to their readers... which in-turn can be sent out the to entire community for view/feedback. That is something SOE cannot do on their own. Graffe tried to tell you this on the EQLive forums, and Raaj even posted his contact info here for the same purpose. We should be fortunate that these people have taken it upon themselves to take the time to do just that.<br />
<br />
This is something the EQ community has been begging for SOE to do for years, and when it finally happens, you're just pissed off because you weren't picked.</div></div><hr />

Very well, and I didn't.<br />
<br />
- If the summit forums were limited to fansight forum owners only that would be the situation.  What we have now is specific guild leaders with access to candid honest information from developers and the rest of us feeding off what they decide we should know.<br />
<br />
- When other guilds have access to candid honest information from developers and i rely on second hand, edited, incomplete information it  puts me at a competitive disadvantage.<br />
<br />
- I think you missed my point that that information is never as good as first hand information.  With information being transcribed edited and summerized their is an opprotunity for details that i may find benifical to be left completely out where guilds I compete with will have access to this information.<br />
<br />
Why do you think it's so difficult to create a level playing field with respect to player information from offical sources.<br />
<br />
Because creating a forum for community interaction already exists, and it is exactly where you're post was locked. The interaction with forum and guild leaders, limiting the number of contacts possible to maximize the distribution of information through the efficient channels (ie: summit members) is exactly why the forum exists.<br />
<br />
Like I said before, why did they picked those guilds? I have no idea. From what I am reading on some servers, they probably could have made a better choice in regards to guild selection, but that is out of our hands.<br />
<br />
<br />
We are not going to see eye to eye on this I don't think and you have every right to have your opinion, but turning my words around and useing slippery slope arguments won't leave people with more respect for your angle.<br />
<br />
Judging from what I read and quoted from EQLive... I didn't.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Frax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">The bottom line is SOE had a shitstorm of public image problems on their hands, and this is their attempt to remedy the situation, so they essentially bought some public relations goodwill by schmoozing select uberguild leaders and promising them the moon.  I have yet to see anything come from this guild summit in regards to game issues that wasn't already brought up by hundreds of players in open forums. Of course the people invited will defend the process.. they are now part of the process. Sony failed to collect this information effectively for the last four years, and when the account cancellations started rolling in, they pushed the panic button.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Wrong. One of SoE's biggest mistakes was making the previous beta's open, and the casual player base testing raid content / raid level zones, or zones they will will only see after they have been nerfed to shit.<br />
<br />
Seriously, the people that play this game for their own personal enjoyment, 1-2 hours a day should &quot;not&quot; be testing the content, the very reason we (the upper end player base) play the game for.<br />
<br />
he, Solanthious, I wasn't ever thinking about casual, and even less to a open beta. I was referencing to some uberguild that haven't been invited to participate to it. I really don't think that a casual player could have been able to test high end content, thats why I said `other that could/should have `, I thought it was obviously referencing to other uberguild, looks like it wasn't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Celeritum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">I just worry that the information discussed will solely be based on the raid game, and thusly, focus future content entirely on raid gaming with little if no casual gaming aspects.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">If the expansion isn't 100% geared towards the '.5%', who are they going to use to test the lower end content?

&quot;...the rest of us feeding off what they decide we should know.&quot;<br />
&quot;...i rely on second hand, edited, incomplete information it puts me at a competitive disadvantage&quot;<br />

What would be better?<br />
<br />
1. For Brenlo to post on 15 different message boards, and then have to sift through thousands of posts that become of his visits to filter/sort to find any relevant information.<br />
<br />
2. Or for Brenlo to receive the results in a summerize PM or email from the 15 forum leaders.<br />
<br />
If you voted for #1, then you have the problem that's been going on for years on EQLive. Whereas #2 is why the summit forum was created. It was also created so that anything the devs say would then be passed on to other forums (I'll say it again) via efficient channels, the forum leaders. To hear something out of one voice as opposed to a thousand saying the same thing, because it is difficult to find anything you are looking for in the thousands speaking. Whereas the one voice representing everyone else is speaking to you directly.<br />
<br />
If my boss wants to find out something from each of my staff. He isn't going to send out a mass email, and wait for a large number of emails to return with varying answers. He's going to have me pass along the requests, and they return to me their answers. I summarize it, and give it to him in one email. In this case, replace boss with SOE, replace me with forum/guildleaders, and staff with EQ community.<br />
<br />
Graffe tried to tell you that he posts regular updates about what goes on on the summit forums, and Juwel does as well on therunes.net. Nothing edited out, nothing held back.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">My pre-post was a little incoherent.<br />
<br />
The deal is simply this -- 90% of players think a &quot;beta&quot; is a demo. It  is NOT. A beta if for finding and testing bugs to release a final product. The guilds of today completely blow the developers minds in terms of strategic thought and ways around their tricks.<br />
<br />
Was there perhaps some people chosen that shouldnt' have been? I wont answer that, but you try being perfect.<br />
<br />
If this expansion comes out buggy as the rest, then you have a reason to bitch. Until then, this entire thread is a whine-fest about who did and did not get in, and it's absolutely rediculous.<br />
<br />
Competition died in EQ with instancing. Brutall, take a step back, remember the GoDbeta? Were you there? Did you help to test Inktu'Ta with prathun on an open raid when the entire thing was spoiled by releasing the info on how to defeat the stonemites?<br />
<br />
Look, I'm not saying anyone is better than anyone else. What I'ms aying is you have people trying to improve your hobby and you bitch at every move SOE makes to try to better that. What is the real reason your bitching?<br />
<br />
If I had to bet, I would say it's jealousy and spoiler information. Let me fill you in on a little something: when the idea was first introduced EVERYONE agreed that they would be interested, as long as the spoiiler information was kept to a miinimum. This includes fake mob names, fake ae names, porting from one place to another, freezing mobs, hell maybe even fale mob models and zone names. <br />
<br />
You're not number 1. Nobody is number 1 anyone due to isntancing. This is a game, and these people are trying to make it better for you. Instead of flaming them for having something you don't, you should be offering suggestions on how to make it all the better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So many insane things being &quot;issues&quot; in this thread.<br />
<br />
Brutall is pissed because his guild is at a 'disadvantage&quot; because someone sees an unfinished encounter before him.  Who cares?   There were quite a number of people on the InktuTa beta that had &quot;inside infoz&quot; who have yet to pass it.   Hell, there were quite a number of people there who have yet to SEE it.<br />
<br />
Partha is curious about how &quot;the ubers&quot; can beta test something for the &quot;casuals&quot;.    That's the biggest farce ever.   Every &quot;casual&quot; I saw on the LDoN beta immediately betabuffed to 65 and tried to get in on time level adventures so they could go to the &quot;merchant malls&quot;.   They didn't give a rat's ass about their own demographic, they wanted the goods.   As a matter of fact, the most humorous thing ever was seeing the &quot;newly uber&quot; (those who were teal ogres with time gear) announcing smugly that they wouldn't accept &quot;betabuffs&quot; into their &quot;uber&quot; groups.<br />
<br />
I /betabuffed to level 40, and never once found a group to test shit.   My betabuff level 40 warrior is still on the server, along with Frodlin and Frodlinx.   It amazes me that of all the people I ran into who wanted to thoroughly put stuff through the paces at various levels happenned to be my peers in the &quot;upper end&quot;.  People like Raaj, Grongl, Brutul.   <br />
<br />
During the melee changes beta, I personally spent HOURS and HOURS and HOURS standing in Freeport beating on the exterminator, Myself and Grongl spent HOURS in Marus Seru with level 30 characters (warrior and cleric) testing things, I could log onto beta and see... Raaj, Grongl, Myself, Furor, Hobbun, and Behemoth at pretty much any time.   We werent' there getting &quot;leet infoz&quot; but trying to make sure this fucking game was enjoyable.    Of course, people pooh poohed the openings changes and got em hosed, which is a damn shame because they were fun, but it certainly doesn't alter the reality that those testing were testing for the benefit of everyone.  <br />
<br />
I for one trust Raaj when he says that the beta is being done with confidence and with tact, because I don't believe for a damn second that Raaj would sell ANYONE out for some infoz.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Demorgoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">My guild is in the 'sekrit forumz', and were invited to beta OoW raids. We're currently in Tacvi, and I'm an officer, though not the one who went to the summit, due to being non-US.<br />
<br />
Forum: There's little to nothing 'unique' that we get from there in terms of information. More info comes from contacts in simlar levels guilds, and personal contact with devs, often pre-existing. The majority of info that comes direct from the forums is 'XXX is broken and will be fixed YYY'. I've personally heard this info from Xserver channels before hearing it from our 'rep'. There is no info about 'To beat XXX you gotta use YYY trick'. It's basically a glorified bug report forum that targets the high level game, ignoring the 'This door in freeport doesn't swing right' stuff. I'd still love personal access to the forums, but I don't have it. Yup, I'm jealous. Shit happens.<br />
<br />
Beta: It's unlikely we'll be betaing OoW in any serious way (if at all). In order to find out what's 'wrong' with an event, you need practice at it. Repeated days raiding it. That means harming our own progression for the sake of 'advance info' on OoW events that will probably be changed beyond recognition by the time we see them live. The amount we'll lose, both in terms of GoD progression and gear equipment upgrades, by spending several days a week raiding in OoW, far outweighs any benefits for us as a guild. If anyone else is willing to hinder their own guild progression/power in order to make things better for the rest of us when we get there, they have my respect, as they're better men than I. <br />
Note: I'll happily test outside raid times, but with attendance the way it is, if we can get 50+ people online at the same time, I want them pushing the guild forward.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">After reading all these posts, I still have some questions.<br />
<br />
Most of us are convinced that at least in the past, players invited to beta test have gotten themselves betabuffed and ran around trying to see the highest level content possible. They weren't testers assigned to a zone, a mob, a task.<br />
<br />
Between this and SoE limiting access to some content, we the players got content tuned for level 70's, DX9 bugs, broken scripts, etc.<br />
<br />
IF beta testers and SoE's beta test program is intended to ship high quaility product without numerous readily apparent bugs, it's failed miserably. Sure some content might get fixed, some bugs reported, etc. BUT, the aim is commercial quality product.<br />
<br />
Frodlin, would you have put the DX9 changes in the game the way it was done? OR, as I suspect, are many of your criticisms of SoE not put in the strongest possible terms and not shared with the community because you don't want to run the risk of losing access.<br />
<br />
Privately communicated concerns didn't cause OoW release to be delayed and SoE to focus on existing bugs and improving current content - declining subscriptions and general discontent caused that to happen. Privately communicated concerns didn't cause the Melee Phase 1 Update to happen - general concern widely expressed with a persuisive argument did.<br />
<br />
Having liked the Openings system, you supported it publicly. Do you report back to SoE things you know have gneral player support and climb on board enthusiastically although you may not be all that favorably diposed?<br />
<br />
Understand, I'm NOT questioning your motives at all, but I am calling to your attention that your motives are yours - not mine, not Brutul's, Partha's, etc. They may not (or may) be representative of what players in general want. I'm SURE you try to be a great Warrior Correspondent, but do you act as a conduit for ideas at all times or sometimes do you act as a gatekeeper? I assume you are human and some ideas never will be reported. I'm certain that in your opinion the Ikkinz trials were tuned exactly right, they kept out the riff raff. Did it occur to you that perhaps anyone below your capability or your guild's is in your mind riff raff?<br />
<br />
Understand, I'm NOT calling you or Raaj or anyone else out. I AM saying that open communication with the player community is a benefit even if it's read-only. Even if dev's read TSW without replying. Even if players can only read the summit forum without posting.<br />
<br />
I apreciate players Testing. I don't appreciate the betabuffed trotting around in new content that has gone on in the past.<br />
<br />
I've been the Producer on software products in the past (MANY of us have). Frankly, given the bugginess of GoD I would have without hesitation reworked the ENTIRE testing process and removed the beta access of many of those that had it. Beta testing and testing in general did NOT serve the general player population well during the DX9 patches and GoD release. I have personally encountered bugs in every single instanced encounter in GoD I've been in - some have been subsequently fixed. But beta testing did not insure they didn't reach the consumer.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Demorgoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">Frodlin is TWO things simultaneously. The warrior 'correspondant' and a warrior EQer. Those two are seperate. The correspondant part simply involves sorting the 'wheat from the chaff' in the 100s of warrior related posts on several boards, and passing on the distilled concerns. You will NEVER find a 100% objective person, purely because someone can't be a casual player AND a hardcore player, nor a fulltime raider AND a devout non-raider. NO-ONE would be immune to accusations of bias.<br />
<br />
Whoever did the job would only have one perspective, because you're only playing one warrior. That has no relevence to the job whatsoever. Frod passes on '... feels Tipt needs re-evaluation', or '... thinks there should be more warrior specific itemisation in the 50-55 bracket' if it's posted, regardless of whether it effects him directly or not. Regardless of whether he agrees with it or not. He's posted specific threads asking for input on 'casual' warriors, because it's something he's not as familiar with.<br />
<br />
Frankly, Frod has done more than most correspondants in trying to cover all the bases, but he's also a player. Unless he's specifically posting with correspondant related requests, or passing on correspondant related information, he should be free to post his opinion without reproach. He gets NOTHING (afaik) for doing this job, and shouldn't have to give up his opinion on everything, just because he volunteered to collate and pass on information.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">Demorgoth,<br />
<br />
Please understand that I'm not suggesting Frodlin is doing a poor job. I in fact think he's doing a good one.<br />
<br />
The same is true with Raaj, Brutul, and the DH player/s that went to the summit or those beta testing.<br />
<br />
What I am saying is two things:<br />
<br />
1. A filter is a filter. Everone is human. Graffe's reports on the summit forum will be incomplete or interpreted. Sometmes there's a reason for a filter - 10,000 posts a week (personally, if I worked as a designer or dev for SoE, I'd be commited enough to the prduct to read every singl post in all the forums - it's really NOT all that much material) or to avoid flaming. Sometimes there is not - the summit forum seems to me to fall in this catagory.<br />
<br />
2. The Beta test program did not serve players well with the introduction of DX9 (maybe they didn't participate - I don't know) or GoD. I suspect many of the participants aren't funtioning as hardcore testers sending an extensive buglist each and every session. IMO it's too much a preview opprotunity for some and too little a testing responsibility. Players not participating in Beta testing are going to tend to judge it's effectiveness by the results they get when they play a new expansion.<br />
<br />
I personally know a large number of players that threw in the towel when RZ and his loot disappeared in PoTime twice in a row after being killed and Quarm couldn't be accessed or when for months content could not be beaten because of mistuning, script bugs, and collision problems.<br />
<br />
EDIT: it occurs to me that my concerns might generally stem from my understanding of what a Beta is, what Beta testing is, what resolving all outstanding bugs prior to shipping is, and what ready to ship product means. My expectations of what consumers should pay for and what isn't ready for prime time may be different from SoE's. Not so much a failure of Beta testers at all - maybe they reported the bugs and SoE didn't fix them.<br />

Failure in this side of OoW could very well kill the game as 70%+ of the population is likely wary as most of them dont feel they got anything out of GoD given EP type aaxp for the AAs, and zones that are beyond the capabilities of many.<br />
<br />
I think GoD created a perception gap that OoW has to fix. If its not tested at the lower end then the gap will continue.<br />

Without coming up with anything more specific, the answer is a more open line of communitation between the community and the class/guild reps. People are going to bitch no matter what, but the less people think is being hidden, the less bitching about lett beta infoz.</div></div><hr />

I think it was a great idea for them to give access to people that are still in the elemental planes. They already stated that there is going to be content for all levels of play, these guys are the ones that will be able to test the average player content and the raid content that they are capable of, so what if they have info to the &quot;l33t b3t8 Inf0z&quot; posted on those boards to zones they are well beyond getting to without a ton of legwork.<br />
<br />
You guys are whining and bitching for nothing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">I think it was a great idea for them to give access to people that are still in the elemental planes.That's not the point. The point is that the way that the participants where picked, SOE could have ended up with incompetent people who are not qualified to do the job. For example (this is not a diss on Raaj, we go way back, this is just for the sake of discussion) - Raaj is an admin on a big warrior board. What makes him qualified to represent the warrior class? Maybe Raaj is a really good IT guy and can administer a web site, but that in no way qualifies him to be a warrior class rep now does it? In this case, Raaj is obviously qualified, but that may not have been the case with the other class/guild reps that were chosen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">My opinion, for what it's worth: thumbs up for Raaj's harsh post.<br />
<br />
Frodlin, about this: &quot;Every &quot;casual&quot; I saw on the LDoN beta immediately betabuffed to 65 and tried to get in on time level adventures so they could go to the &quot;merchant malls&quot;. They didn't give a rat's ass about their own demographic, they wanted the goods.&quot;<br />
<br />
and: &quot;I /betabuffed to level 40, and never once found a group to test shit.&quot;<br />
<br />
and: &quot;Myself and Grongl spent HOURS in Marus Seru with level 30 characters (warrior and cleric) testing things...&quot;<br />
<br />
If getting true casual players who would act like adults to test zones like this is a problem, I know at least one player who, if asked to test lvl 40 and 30 content (and if he would agree to do so), would keep his word.<br />
<br />
He knows a lot about the game at those levels, from drops to quests to fighting to faction, and would have the capacity to make and communicate mature judgements about what things he was qualified to test and what he was not. His top character is a chanter too, so y'all could still play your warriors, heh.<br />
<br />
Needless to say, it's not me (lol).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">For the love of god, I can't believe that this is even an issue.<br />
<br />
So many insane things being &quot;issues&quot; in this thread.<br />
<br />
Brutall is pissed because his guild is at a 'disadvantage&quot; because someone sees an unfinished encounter before him.  Who cares?   There were quite a number of people on the InktuTa beta that had &quot;inside infoz&quot; who have yet to pass it.   Hell, there were quite a number of people there who have yet to SEE it.<br />
<br />
Partha is curious about how &quot;the ubers&quot; can beta test something for the &quot;casuals&quot;.    That's the biggest farce ever.   Every &quot;casual&quot; I saw on the LDoN beta immediately betabuffed to 65 and tried to get in on time level adventures so they could go to the &quot;merchant malls&quot;.   They didn't give a rat's ass about their own demographic, they wanted the goods.   As a matter of fact, the most humorous thing ever was seeing the &quot;newly uber&quot; (those who were teal ogres with time gear) announcing smugly that they wouldn't accept &quot;betabuffs&quot; into their &quot;uber&quot; groups.<br />
<br />
I /betabuffed to level 40, and never once found a group to test shit.   My betabuff level 40 warrior is still on the server, along with Frodlin and Frodlinx.   It amazes me that of all the people I ran into who wanted to thoroughly put stuff through the paces at various levels happenned to be my peers in the &quot;upper end&quot;.  People like Raaj, Grongl, Brutul.   <br />
<br />
During the melee changes beta, I personally spent HOURS and HOURS and HOURS standing in Freeport beating on the exterminator, Myself and Grongl spent HOURS in Marus Seru with level 30 characters (warrior and cleric) testing things, I could log onto beta and see... Raaj, Grongl, Myself, Furor, Hobbun, and Behemoth at pretty much any time.   We werent' there getting &quot;leet infoz&quot; but trying to make sure this fucking game was enjoyable.    Of course, people pooh poohed the openings changes and got em hosed, which is a damn shame because they were fun, but it certainly doesn't alter the reality that those testing were testing for the benefit of everyone.  <br />
<br />
I for one trust Raaj when he says that the beta is being done with confidence and with tact, because I don't believe for a damn second that Raaj would sell ANYONE out for some infoz.<br />
<br />
I'm thankful for the information, and I'm not suggesting that anyone here is solely doing beta for the s33kr!+ infos. I just remember that when GoD came out, one of the betatesters stated quite plainly that pretty much every group he saw was /betabuffing 65 and doing the top end encounters. I'm also sure that some testers are simply going for the advance peek at encounters for their guilds. I would just hate to see everyone /betabuff 65 on this one, test all the broken high end stuff that will STAY broken until Sony decides it's time to patch it, and all the nonraid content gets shoved out the door without a decent looksee. That said, I'm glad to hear ya'll DO look at lower end content. Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">Raaj is obviously qualified, but that may not have been the case with the other class/guild reps that were chosen.<br />
<br />
Just to clarify, I am NOT a class representative, and never even applied for that position.<br />
<br />
And I still think this discussion is silly. We DO look at lower end content. Frodlin is 100% correct in that during the combat system beta there were probably a dozen people who spent hours daily banging away at different levels, different areas, different everything.<br />
<br />
I'm under an NDA for OoW, but just rest assured you won't be forgotten about because you arent 0.5%<br />
<br />
And, like i've said numerous times, if you have questions talk to me. Wandor and I have been in rival guilds for years, and he's still on my aim buddy list - i can't be all that scary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">I think you guys are overestimating the advantage you get from testing.  Anything you learn during testing, any other guild will know within 2 or 3 attempts at the event.  If it's a highly contested spawn or an event with a long lockout on failure then I guess that's an advantage.  For most mobs, it saves that guild a day or two of dying to a mob, but they still have to gear up for it, work out the strat on their own, and execute it.  <br />
<br />
A couple nights on test helping with encounters doesn't turn a pack of newbies into FoH reincarnated, and every night they spend on test is a night of raiding and progression that they lose on their regular server.  Some nights you show up and die a few times with no idea what's going on at all and the devs will say &quot;Ok we got what we needed, thanks for your help&quot;.  They won't tell you what you need to do to get to the event or trigger it, so at most you will find out what the mob hits for, what it's AEs are, what kind of adds are coming, etc.  Any other guild will get all of this info on their first attempt on the encounter, and there's no guarantee that the event will go live in the state that you tested it.<br />
<br />
Finally, as Raaj said, from Plane of Time on there is very little content where guilds have to compete.  Progression in GoD is almost entirely instanced, so a guild having 2 or 3 nights worth of head start on you will not effect your advancement at all, and if their testing makes the encounter more balanced and bug free for you when you get there, it's hard to see how you are losing out on the deal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Drep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">I have no idea what the other guilds are getting, but we were only slotted for 2 days of raid testing.   Since we have specific play times due to work or what not, that pretty much only leaves a half day per day to actually test.   total that up and we get a whole 1 day to test.   Im not complaining what so ever though.    <br />
<br />
There is no way we will learn all the big scoops that would make it unfair with just 2 nights of testing.   Some other guilds may be getting more time but like I said, I have no idea what anyone is getting besides us.    <br />
<br />
I see it as kind of hard to have proper raid testing and give good feeback with this short of a time frame.</div></div><hr />

He did however speak with a few selected guilds and said that it was buged,  guilds that happen to be part of the guild summit.<br />
<br />
This is the type of situation i'm talking about,  I see no reason to facilitate this type of activity with a private forum.  Why give specific guilds privied information repeatedly.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">Ok, through all the bitching and such I hope people have realized a few things about soe and their relationship with select people:<br />
<br />
 There are many buddy-buddy situations going on<br />
 Often times this constitutes &quot;insider&quot; information<br />
 Yes they get into closed betas before anyone else (friends and family anyone)<br />
 Less often times in the past this has meant &quot;unnatural&quot; happenings in the game (/gmsummonSayWhat)<br />
 It hasn't been addressed in the 5+ year history of eq<br />
 It won't be addressed in the next 5 years of sony gaming, as frankly they care less about it<br />
<br />
And the big one: It happens in every single game when you mix human players with human devs. If you think it will be any different in WoW, think again. <br />
<br />
My days of caring are long gone, tho it was 'fun' if you want to say that during late release / pre kunark.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u76"><b>Kaltek_Eci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p76">People bitch if other guilds get leet infoz and people bitch if the game isn't tested by competent raiders which most agree that Sony and it's testing team is not qualified to test their own game.<br />
<br />
Too much knowledge of an event ruins it for testing. You have to go in blind and actually test it and rate it to provide tweaks to the content that is realisitic for the gaming population to achieve and for it to be somewhat fun in the process.<br />
<br />
Ya just can't have it both ways so there is no use agruing it over and over. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Best bet if you want to complain about something is perhaps they shoudl make sure those guilds that participate in these tests should be rotated and not always the same guilds in a sense of fairness.<br />
<br />
In the end it's all about enjoying your content and not worrying about everyone else. It's like my kid... She wants to leave early in the morning to be the first at the bus stop. Who the hell cares if she is first or not... does it really matter? To her it matters sure but only because she lets it matter.<br />
<br />
In this time of instanced content just let it go and focus on enjoying the game and each others company in the game rather than being there first.<br />
<br />
Comparing your own progress to others only sets you up for defeat in the end because there is always going to be someone who beats something first or better than you did.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>Tamener</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">People against public boards are (A) In a guild with access (B) Don't get it.<br />
<br />
If one guild knows that an encounter is broken they can stop working on it waisting time, farm some more gear and as soon as its fixed OMG its posted on the &quot;sekret&quot; board ...ONLY 2 or 3 days ahead.  Nope that doesn't ruin the spirit of competition, which for those of you keeping score at home was the driving force behind things like going to the moon.  You can play your stupid &quot;competition is macho BS&quot; mind games all you want, but when people have something to prove stuff gets done. And its more fun that way.<br />
<br />
High end EQ is plain and simple, competition.  Who gets it dead first!  Ok so what are we talking about here? ONLY guild leaders can even friggin post or see it? HA! Every guild in Tacvi AT LEAST should have their GL in there.  OH NOz!! We might have 30 or 40 people (non-dev) posting in there with that requirement....and it makes PERFECT sense, these are the people with the most work, knowledge, and passion for the game.  They are the ones who take the forefront and try the things that have not been tried, these are the people that DESERVE to be in there. If nothing else they EARNED it, through putting up with dev roablocks for god knows how long.<br />
<br />
Anything less is F***'ing insulting to the community as a whole.  We want our best , brightest and most knowledgable in there.  Not the people who steal their strats the next week.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u78"><b>Tamener</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p78">And furthermore, public &quot;read only&quot; access would not ruin the board as many have suggested.

The driving force against making it public is 90% protection of vested interest and 10% misguided folks trying to do what they percieve is best.  <br />

Or are the things they say that bad?  If there truly is nothing in there that displays dev incompetance to content, then there is nothing to worry about.

<br />
Hell E'ci's public crew is the farthest on the server last I recall anyhow. If they aren't in Tacvi already they are darn close. Why might you ask? Well they have access to a large playerbase so they can easily suit their raid to whatever is needed for the event and don't have to worry about player X had a date tonight etc.<br />
<br />
Progress in EQ unless yer guild is totally full of idiots is simply this...<br />
<br />
People X to do encounter Y amount of times till you figure it out. Face it none of them are that hard... If you have the right classes around all the time you will win. Personally I can't be that proud of just that because I don't feel it's special enough to warrent respect from everyone in EQ... Perhaps like the first person to finish an Epic or something is a bit more deserving.<br />
<br />
Anyone remember who killed Vulak first? How about 3rd 4th 5th etc and do you care anymore?<br />
<br />
Can 60 people show up at the local hangout every day/night of the year and jump rope for X amount of time? Sure there is a bit more talent to many things in EQ but in the end they are much the same imho.<br />
<br />
While the game is fun I don't think beating something first or in the first 50 guilds gives you a badge of honor that everyone should bow to. Just enjoy the game and don't worry about one-upsmanship.<br />
<br />
Striving to do the event flawlessly and faster than your previous time is great fun why do you have to know how well guild X did? Beat yerself it's more rewarding since yer constantly trying to do your best regardless of how good it is compared to others.<br />
<br />
PS-&gt; A forum for those actually doing the encounter with limited members to make sure it stays mature and the discussion's move in a productive manner makes sense. Course we all know that many of these boards are simply strat exchanges for people who feel that guild X has qualified as their peer and aren't feeding info to &quot;inferior&quot; guilds.

Not even close. It has nothing to do with me, it has to do with the requests of the developers not to leak certain things until they are ready for them to be. Some things they allow us to, some things they don't. I release what I'm allowed to, but thank you for calling my character into question based on rumors and the need to believe in conspiracies.</div></div><hr />

I think your character is wonderful and your concern about EQ being a great game is unequaled. I say this without reservation.<br />
<br />
Let me ask two questions:<br />
<br />
1. Rather than you offering to answer any questions we might have reqarding the quild summit boards, would you concider just passing on any information you concider significant enough to note.<br />
<br />
2. There is a NDA in place now. At some point there won't be. Do you really think those that have learned things while beta testing will be sharing? Will there be a post, for example, by you of things you felt were of major importance that you confirm are true as the game goes live? An outpouring of information?<br />
<br />
The concerns I've heard range from the ought not to have happened - how to defeat the Stonemites &quot;leaking&quot; to some and not others - to some guilds having a pretty clear idea how to get traction in a new expansion on day one and others without prior exposure flailing around for a month. The first set of info should not have been shared with anyone. The second set IMO should be known by all or known by none. Beta testing should not be a leg up on new content.<br />
<br />
I'm not intending to be confrontational. But other than Lucy-type info, I've yet to see a trickle of info about a new expansion much less an outpouring once the NDA is lifted.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u86"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p86">1. Rather than you offering to answer any questions we might have reqarding the quild summit boards, would you concider just passing on any information you concider significant enough to note.<br />
<br />
The offer about questions is incase anyone has something that may not have been addressed yet, or that they want to make sure is brought to someones attention.<br />
<br />
<br />
2. There is a NDA in place now. At some point there won't be. Do you really think those that have learned things while beta testing will be sharing? Will there be a post, for example, by you of things you felt were of major importance that you confirm are true as the game goes live? An outpouring of information?<br />
<br />
No, there won't be a post by me about the OOW beta because I haven't had a whole lot of time to play it or anything else lately. I wouldnt do it justice because I simply haven't had enough experience with it to do something like that. As to whether or not people will share what they know - i don't have an answer for you. That'll be something to wait and see I guess.  When I mentioned not being able to tell people about some things, it's more based on the forum than the beta (since thats what the thread was first about). <br />
<br />
Just to make it clear however, it's not common that we're given information on the boards and not allowed to share it. I pass on what I can. There hasn't been a whole lot of new information lately with the fine tuning of getting OOW ready to launch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u87"><b>Tamener</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p87">If you think devs tell us everything they're doing 2 and 3 days in advance, you're delusional. At best, we get a patch message 24hrs in advance which is still at that point subject to change -- therefore not something to post for the masses. <br />
<br />
I didn't say everything.  Aside from that, a 24 hour advanced notice on a patch saying &quot;Hey, this encounter is broken, we are fixing it.&quot; That not everyone has direct access to is complete BS.  Guilds not in the summit then have to depend on the kindness of other guilds to tell them or fan sites to post it. In essence being placed in a 2nd class role.<br />
<br />
I havent done the low level content in years, and no matter how well I can get around lower guk or solusek b those places are outdated. I can't get to Shar Vahl from nexus without a map to save my life simply because i've never had to. There's nobody better to ask about the specifics of any level of content in EQ than the people directly playing in that content. They may not know the mechanics as well as I do, but they sure know the specifics a lot better. <br />
<br />
Personally, I think I know most of the content below me, better then the people doing it now.  I remember spawns points in everything from Lguk to ToV, pathing routes, traps, and named and thier loot tables, not to mention drop rates.  AE's, procs, melee dmg, etc...Why? Cause I have done them, and I had to learn it, learning it is what allowed me to beat it.  Granted I have always been one to lead raids, and do the research, but these are the types of people that are guild representatives on those boards....or at least they should be....would you disagree with that?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't think there is any gratification in winning things first in this game either.<br />
<br />
Hell E'ci's public crew is the farthest on the server last I recall anyhow. If they aren't in Tacvi already they are darn close. Why might you ask? Well they have access to a large playerbase so they can easily suit their raid to whatever is needed for the event and don't have to worry about player X had a date tonight etc.<br />
<br />
Progress in EQ unless yer guild is totally full of idiots is simply this...<br />
<br />
People X to do encounter Y amount of times till you figure it out. Face it none of them are that hard... If you have the right classes around all the time you will win. Personally I can't be that proud of just that because I don't feel it's special enough to warrent respect from everyone in EQ... Perhaps like the first person to finish an Epic or something is a bit more deserving.<br />
<br />
Anyone remember who killed Vulak first? How about 3rd 4th 5th etc and do you care anymore?<br />
<br />
Can 60 people show up at the local hangout every day/night of the year and jump rope for X amount of time? Sure there is a bit more talent to many things in EQ but in the end they are much the same imho.<br />
<br />
While the game is fun I don't think beating something first or in the first 50 guilds gives you a badge of honor that everyone should bow to. Just enjoy the game and don't worry about one-upsmanship.<br />
<br />
Striving to do the event flawlessly and faster than your previous time is great fun why do you have to know how well guild X did? Beat yerself it's more rewarding since yer constantly trying to do your best regardless of how good it is compared to others. <br />
<br />
You missed the point completely, its not about being remembered, its about the competition of doing it first.  Do you remember who won the 400 meter relay in the 1904 Olympics (Held in St. Louis USA btw), no? not so surprising....does that mean it was not worth the effort? Of course it was, its not about being remembered!  Its just about some fun competition in a game we enjoy, and like life it has its drama mixed in, but thats part of the risk you run with multi-player games.  But none of those things means we shouldn't compete for the fun of competing.  And ruining the competition in this fassion is the same thing as another athlete using steriods in the Olympics.<br />
<br />
PS-&gt; A forum for those actually doing the encounter with limited members to make sure it stays mature and the discussion's move in a productive manner makes sense. Course we all know that many of these boards are simply strat exchanges for people who feel that guild X has qualified as their peer and aren't feeding info to &quot;inferior&quot; guilds. While it's fine we don't need to spit on our neighbors who love the game also =) <br />
<br />
First of all, nobody is suggesting it be opened for everyone to post....just for everyone to read, so your first sentance has no validity to this debate, since most will if not all will agree with it. Second, nobody thus far is suggesting guilds are using this to pass on l33t beta inf0z and in1der str@ts to one another.   What is being eledged (and supported by those with access I might add) is that Devs are giving patch, and OoW information to a select group of guilds and not to the rest of the community.<br />
<br />
Nobody has really come up with a decent reason for the boards not to be read-only to the EQ community. The responces they are trying to avoid is the &quot;feedback&quot; they are trying to collect when you think about it.  But we all know the density of morons EQ has in its population, so I can agree with restricted posting access completely.<br />
<br />
 Also as I stated in a previous post, and Raaj you know this to be true, if people don't have a valid argument it will be dead or get tossed  into the R&amp;F section of whatever board they decide to whine about it on, within 48 hours. Furthemore, without one clear cut place to post, arguments will be spread thin and be rather pointless. <br />
<br />
You currently have two classes within the EQ community, those &quot;Chosen&quot; to be in on the info ahead, and those waiting for someone above them to pass it on.  <br />
<br />
On the other hand you could have a community all on the same page, all getting it straight from the horses mouth as they say.<br />
<br />
I really don't see what the big deal is.....</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're reading into things. I said &quot;at best&quot; we get that.  Even then it's rare, and they have matched the real patch messages in the past. It's not something saying &quot;Hey guys stay away from this because it's broken&quot;. I agree that if it were that would be an advantage.<br />
<br />

<br />
Again you're focusing on raids. Not everyone in EQ raids, but it seems that the more you raid the more narrow your focus gets. We tend to forget that there's a lot more people out there doing other things and that they shouldn't be ignored. I think that the people who have access to the board do a  good job to make sure that everyone's voice is heard. The majority are high end raiders, but definately not everyone.<br />
<br />
Anyway this thread isn't really a high end issue so I'm moving it to the tavern.</div></div><hr />

<br />
it's the availability and opportunity of being uber with enough $$$'s that makes the low end of EQ  (which is STILL fun; i'm in the middle of doing it again ) that makes people who can see the upper end feel that it's not being presented to them too.<br />
<br />
Hell; if we had HALF the shit in EQ back in 1999 that people this day have to start with; I don't think EQ would be where it is now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u93"><b>Tamener</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p93">Again you're focusing on raids.

<br />
Actually, its you who missed the point.  Who in this game is capable of doing every aspect of the game.<br />
<br />
The aspects being.<br />
<br />
1) High End Raiding<br />
2) Mid Level Raiding<br />
3) Low End Raiding<br />
4) Casual Raiding<br />
5) Casual Tradeskilling/Socializing<br />
<br />
<br />
The answer? High end raiders.  They are the ones who are most likely to have incite on all of these different areas.  Are they the ones with vested interests in them? Nope.  But thats why you have fan site people involved also.  To cover that other aspect.  <br />
<br />
So you might ask then what is the difference between the 2?  There is no such thing as a &quot;High End Fan Site&quot; there is not much in the way of competing for &quot;First Kill&quot; for those sites.  Point being the topic of discussion here is the negative impact the boards are having on the community in a number of ways regarding raiding guilds.  Thats what this discussion is about, thus thats what I am talking about.<br />
<br />
The negative impacts it has are creates the at least the appearance of favoratism, hinders competition, and adds another tier to the social structure of the EQ community which alienates people.<br />
<br />
But lets ignore all that and get down to the heart of the issue shall we?  The EXACT argument Raaj uses to say we shouldn't worry about it, is the best reason why it shouldn't matter if they open it to everyone.  Raaj along with others have repeatedly portayed the info within the site as &quot;nothing new&quot; and &quot;not helpful&quot;.  If its nothing new guys there is no reason for you not to support the rest of your ciommunity in having access.  You cannot have it both ways, not matter how hard you try.<br />
<br />
You are either getting advantage from the info which I am sure everyone agrees is unfair.<br />
<br />
Or you are getting nothing new from it and it wouldn't make a spit worth of difference if everyone could read it.<br />
<br />
Which of those two is it Raaj?<br />
<br />
Oh and.....<br />
<br />
Hell; if we had HALF the shit in EQ back in 1999 that people this day have to start with; I don't think EQ would be where it is now. <br />
<br />
I think this will prove to be true of all succesful MMORPGs, for the simple reason that it is a byproduct of progression through the game. On some levels it is sad that people cannot experience the game as many of us once did, I am sure plenty of us remember the first time we hit quadruple digit plat.  But at the same time, its required for people who are just joining the game to not feel so hopelessly far behind that its not worth playing.  Just my 2cp on that subject.</div></div><hr />

If that isn't the single most tunnelvisioned view of what there is to do in EQ I don't know what is.<br />
<br />
I don't give a flying rip about the rest of this argument but to say that raiding is 4 of 5 &quot;aspects&quot; of the game is really just saying there is raiding or socializing and nothing inbetween. <br />

<br />
God, what a boring fucking game you must play. <br />
<br />
<br />
Ok so what parts of the game have I missed?<br />
<br />
There are several different levels of raiders, and there are people who play it for socializing.  What game do you play?  Your problem is that your assuming that each of those aspects has nothing more to them then what is directly associated to the words, when in reality High End raiders do things like tradeskills and socialize....thats just not the MAIN portion of their EQ play times.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Now as to raiding being 4 of 5 aspects, take a look around you 80% of the EQ population raids in some form. Easily.  They don't raid Tacvi, but they DO raid. There are guilds on my server who do Kael Arena for armor.  Thats low end raiding.  <br />
<br />

<br />
For those who still don't get it, GUILDS SHOULD NOT BE TESTING RAID CONTENT IN EXPANSIONS BEFORE RELEASE!! <br />
<br />
WHY ARE WE TYPING IN CAPS??? <br />
<br />
OH YEAH SO PEOPLE WILL READ IT AND THINK WE ARE KEWL!!!<br />
<br />
Nobody has a problem with them putting together raids on the beta server, but to bring in an entire guild and put them into an encounter is a clear cut advantage for the guild when they do that encounter.  And then people say &quot;well sometimes the encounter doesn't even go live the way we test it.&quot;  thats all fine and well but then you didn't test the encounter anyways and you didn't help them.<br />
<br />
A group of beta testers can test if an encounter works. Any information from devs that an entire guild is given access to should be information available to everyone.<br />
<br />
And finally....<br />
<br />
NO ONE IS OUT TO MAKE YOUR GAME PLAYING EXPERIENCE SO FOOKING HORRIBLE AND MISERABLE AS YOU MAKE IT OUT TO BEING. <br />
<br />
Please quote me where I said this was a deliberate attempt to make my play experience un-fun. You can't.  Don't put words in my mouth just because you can't formulate an argument without it. <br />
<br />
Fact is there are a lot people who put a lot of work into making this a fun game, then some people post their concerns and feedback on one aspect of how they are doing that, and all of the sudden we are the bad guys for trying to be on a level playing field. Right gotcha......<br />
<br />
Still waiting for a good reason, the NDA thing is BS since thats the reason why we want access.  If guilds have to sign an NDA to get thier rep on the board then obviously the devs think they are getting some info from it that the rest of the EQ population is not.  The NDA is detrimental to the argument against public boards.  Its almost silly how little you thought that through. <br />
<br />
I will say it again plain and simple:<br />
<br />
Select guilds should not have access to information directly from Devs that the rest of the community does not have.  <br />
<br />
Beta testers can do anything a guild can do to test, without giving a guild an unfair advantage.</div></div><hr />

Anyway, that aside, I've pretty much explained everything I can explain in this thread. Obviously I'm not the one who can give you what you want (read only access). I never thought of this thread as an argument, but it's a shame that some people have to have everything as &quot;Us Vs Them&quot;. I attempted to explain to you what the board is, since you can't see it. I don't personally feel that it creates any unfair advantage. You can either choose to believe the hearsay, or you can believe those of us who have access to the forum and therefore have an opinion based on fact. It doesn't bother me either way. <br />
<br />
It's their board, they have their reasons, and this is something you should take up with them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u107"><b>Tamener</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p107">&quot;The NDA is BS.&quot; - some idiot on TSW. <br />
<br />
Way to take that out of context.<br />
<br />
The true context of it is that the NDA is a BS reason for not allowing access to the boards since the fact that you need to sign an NDA to get on the boards is the reason we are objecting to it...SWEET IRONY!!<br />
<br />
This is where someone quotes me and complete missunderstands that so let me explain a bit more:<br />
<br />
The NDA signifies that there is information about they're product that would be considered &quot;spoiler&quot; and therefor they don't want the public to have access to that info.  But then they give said info to a very select group of guilds and fan sites, in effect giving spoiler info to some guilds but not others. This info including actual raiding within the new content.<br />
<br />
Thats about as simple and plain as you can make it, if you can't understand why thats bad then you probably are still pondering what wonderous luck it is that a stage is a good place to put on a play.<br />
<br />
We have people who have access who have taken a lot of positions now, we have<br />
<br />
1) There is no new info on the boards anyways so don't worry about it.<br />
2) There is not much info on the boards, and they don't get very specific so don't worry about it.<br />
3) The boards don't talk about new content, and they only give patch information about encounters out in advance.<br />
4) Ok maybe they talk about new content a little bit and they only give patch information about encounters out 24 hours before everyone else finds out.<br />
5) There is good information on the boards but you should just be happy that someone is getting the info at all and &quot;STFU&quot;.<br />
6) And now we have -  There is an NDA so we can't tell you.<br />
<br />
Not to start a political argument, but Flip-Flop much?<br />
<br />
You just answered your own question bro. NDA is what they agree to. It's NOT up to Raaj to re-write the NDA that HE AGREED to because of you and a few other jacktards who think that they are the second coming of the lord jesus christ and DESERVE THE FACTS on name alone. <br />
<br />
Not asking anyone to re-write an NDA, GD your fuggin dense.  Where did I say i deserved facts because of my name? And where did I compare myself to christ? Nice attempt at putting words in my mouth though.<br />
<br />
 Go bitch to SoE about their NDA man. We can't re-write it. I dare you to go bark up SoE's tree and tell them their NDA is bullshit and you deserve to know. <br />
<br />
See this was already done, which is why the post is now here.  Its a thread, people are posting their opinions yourself included in that. And as far as your little comment here on the NDA, once again you take it out of context and completely miss the point. The NDA itself is FINE, the fact that they are giving entire guilds as a group access to things where an NDA is needed is NOT FINE. And once again, a nice attempt at putting words in my mouth.<br />
<br />
 Or just get over it. YOu're not in the Beta, and to even get as much information about is as you have now is a gratuity in itself. <br />
<br />
Your the one still reading the thread, if you don't wanna hear it just don't read it. BTW I am in OoW Beta, but asshats run around making it a train-fest and thus unfun, so people who know WTH we are doing can't test content.  Oh n0z did i break the NDA by saying that? It is sacred &gt;&lt;<br />

Trying to put words in someones mouth to try and win an argument is pathetic, and it only goes to show how weak your position is in the first place.</div></div><hr />

Anywho.. the reasons we have guilds testing contect...is so the content is tested before FOH/Trion gets to it and its tested and marginally not buggy live. One of the things that EQ has needed to do for a long time.  And in fact one of the things that WE (the players of EQ as a whole--at least on the higher end) asked for.<br />

You have a choice:<br />
<br />
1) Buggy, unblanced content.<br />
2) Guild testing of content.<br />
<br />
Choose one.</div></div><hr />

Well, it may be quite awhile before Fires of Heaven gets to it all things concidered. I'm not at all certain what Triton is up to, so can't comment about that.<br />

Um I think there are more than two choices. Ya see, there's this software engineering discipline called testing. A lot of companies actually have departments that will make a list of bugs and as software is revised insure that the fixed bugs are fixed.<br />
<br />
When players complained that they could get stuck in terrain or sink up to their waist in the floor, an SoE employee was forthcoming enough to volunteer that the collision system needed variables used to define cylinders employed in the collision system. This work was incomplete. Any kind of testing at all would reveal it.<br />
<br />
Yes, once debuging produces a Beta that doesn't contain show-stoppers (bugs that normal companies would concider unacceptable in a shipped product - usually those that mak a major feature or section of the application unusable), player testing can serve a useful purpose.<br />
<br />
But let's not kid ourselves, high-level guilds were play testing and forwarding bugs in GoD. They just did it after release. I suspect inviting guilds to beta test is just as much a matter of making them happy after the GoD debacle as getting some free manpower pounding on betas and reporting bugs.<br />
<br />
Further, some players from high level guilds have always play tested betas and had special access - I believe some members of FoH and even perhaps Afterlife did. This did not result in releases not containing show-stoppers or a product that motivated the general membership of either guild to continue playing EQ.<br />
<br />
Professional testers test professionally. The choice you left out was:<br />
<br />
3) Professional testing and the repair of all show-stoppers prior to shipping.<br />
<br />
I'm not at all opposed to players beta testing the product. But many of the problems in GoD were not because this wasn't done - players did beta test. The problems in GoD existed despite player testing.<br />
