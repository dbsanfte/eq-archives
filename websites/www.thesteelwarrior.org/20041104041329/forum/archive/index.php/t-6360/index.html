Basically, i have 1000pp =( I recently bought an Anger 3 proc for my Club of the Mad Researcher, and noticed aggro is much easier to get, so i am happy i got that, and currently looking for a good secondary.  I currently have 759 ADV points, thinking of getting Malevolent boots(1700 points of mine came from Miraguls).<br />
<br />
I am also sort of a secondary(original owner of account was a guildee and gave it to me), my cleric main is in an Elemental flagged guild, but i play Grogle 90% of the time when not raiding.  Soon the Ornate Greatswords will be going to alts, and was thinking of picking up one of those if i got a chance. <br />
<br />
<br />
So, basically, budget=LDoN points and 1k+whateve ri get overtime from LDoN, any suggestions =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Replace your earrings asap, get a lupine frenzy earring (mistmoore adventure drop) and there is a nice 5 ac 5 sta 40 hp earring from north ro you can buy with points.<br />
<br />
Replace the champions bracers and boots with malevolent or royal attendant and you'll be set for a while.</div></div><hr />
