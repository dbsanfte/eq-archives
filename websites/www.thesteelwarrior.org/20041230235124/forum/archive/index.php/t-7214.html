<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gorlab</div><div class="date">05-18-2004, 03:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">AC and Hps will always give you a significant benefit, stats will almost alway give you much less benefit.  If you concentrate on AC and hps before stats then you will be fine.  (Recognize that sta directly translates into HPs so until you cap it you can see the tradeoff easily.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abividad</div><div class="date">05-18-2004, 03:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Early on, especially for twinking purposes +HP &gt; anything else. Then AC becomes important next. For stats, stamina should be first priority since it translates into more HP the higher level you become, then followed by Dex for some weapon proccing help, strength, then agility. Strength and Agility might be flipped, since defensive skill-ups check off your agility if I remember correctly</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">05-18-2004, 03:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only really important decision is to pick<br />
1. A warrior<br />
2. Sumpin else.<br />
<br />
Congrats! You chose the correct answer!<br />
<br />
Seriously, if you focus on AC/hps most of the time you'll be best off. In the upper levels of the game, the armor with good AC/hps tends to max your melee stats out. But until then, a lot depends on what sort of armor is available to you (according to your budget and whether you are in a guild, etc).<br />
STA is nice because it adds several hitpoints per STA; DEX is nice because it helps govern how quickly you gain skill with a weapon and, later, influences the proc rate of weapons.<br />
But for the most part, the armor with the best AC is the best armor.<br />
There are a couple of exceptions to the AC &gt; all rule early on. Two classic young warrior armor sets -- crafted and crustacean -- are an example. In some slots, crafted has slightly more AC, but the crusty armor has so much STA that it more than makes up for the AC difference.<br />
Other than that, early on try to make sure that your stats rise above 75, or you incur a noticable penalty.<br />
Very occasionally, you might face certain casting mobs that require some sort of resist gear -- magic, cold or fire, typically -- but those are special cases.<br />
<br />
Good luck with your new warrior!</div></div><hr />

<br />
You couldn't be bothered to look THAT far?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ducky222</div><div class="date">05-18-2004, 04:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">look, dam dude sorry to piss you off, didn't realize it so back off. this is a) my first time on this website and b) my first warrior, so sorry u didn't like my post.<br />

<br />
Please check your ego at the door please.<br />
<br />
It is also good practice to search threads before posting a new question, gets old answering the same thing over and over, which I think you could understand.<br />
<br />
This was even more evident when the same post basically was answered just 3 posts below yours.<br />
<br />
Unlike Haass I woudln't have brought this to your attention, I just wouldn't reply, since I replied to the first one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frostpaw</div><div class="date">05-18-2004, 04:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thats the spirit ducky!  Don't let Haass push ya around :)<br />
<br />
But search is cool once ya learn how the site is laid out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ducky222</div><div class="date">05-18-2004, 04:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok, sorry, i gues i have a hot head, but after he meantioned that i didn't see the post anyways and just rechecked to the bottom of this page and still don't see it, i see questions about lvl 60+ upgrades but other then that nothing about new warriors.<br />

<br />
Titled &quot;Do any stats REALLY matter other than AC/HP? &quot;<br />
<br />
Sure, it's not EXACTLY specific to you, but it's exactly what you need to know. Look for information before posting, there is about a 0% chance you will bring up some question that hasn't been answered many times before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">05-18-2004, 05:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You also have to understand that's just how Haass is.  He tends to know what he's talking about when he posts, and has done a lot of work parsing to prove/disprove various theories about tanking, so we generally try to forgive him for being an ass. :D<br />
<br />
Search is your friend young padawan.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">05-18-2004, 06:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not really an ass, I just play one on TV.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vamcoy</div><div class="date">05-19-2004, 03:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No you are haass but I dont think anyone here would have you any other way. You're like the kid in school we got told see if youre not nice youll end up like him:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">05-19-2004, 04:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Even for low levels, AC is still more important than HP.  Unless you have someone who can heal you or you have significant regen capabilities you eventually still have to sit down and get those HPs back, so it'd be better to have less HPs but losing them slower.  Of course if you have someone to heal you then it's not horribly important either way since your chance of dying is very slim.</div></div><hr />

I have a special program that translates Haass.<br />
Let me run it here...okay:<br />
The translation of his post is:<br />
Good morning, sir. For further information, look at the other AC/hp/stat thread in this forum. It is always a good policy to read up on issues that concern you, and it is very likely the case that a good deal of information on those issues will be somewhere on this site. Although it may not be entirely obvious to you, AC/hps are critical at every phase of the game, whether your stats are maxxed or not, just as that thread implies.<br />
<br />
What's lost in the translation is another bit of information that almost every Haass post has behind it: to be a very good warrior pay attention to everything around you and, particularly in your own actions, stand for no slacking, tolerate no errors, let no one do your work for you, and above all get the job done. If Haass didn't hold himself to this standard, his sig would say something else, and you'd only be able to see it in old posts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">05-19-2004, 08:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey now, sometimes an ass is just an ass.  Lets not try to read into it too much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">05-19-2004, 10:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pffft. <br />
I did a search for &quot;Haass&quot; + &quot;ass&quot; in all open forums.<br />
Only 5 matches, and you do have 2741 posts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gimmel</div><div class="date">05-19-2004, 12:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Haass = Ha + ass.<br />
I have no idea what that means, but it looks significant to me. Maybe he laughs while being an ass? I don't know, this stuff is way too deep for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ducky222</div><div class="date">05-19-2004, 12:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i think i will buy him the gear, buff him with temp and my druid and send him out to kill..... then around lvl 10 start pl'n him a little, at least till 25 so i can start doing ldons and at 25 a few zones open up so it will be easier to find a group.<br />
