On one account I have my main, a 65 druid. On the other a 52 war...question is...at like 60+ is it possible to duo in the planes? pov / pos or even pon / pod / poi? I'm gonna level my war up either way...just wondering. I think with tod it's doable, maybe not the fastest exp, but better than nothing.<br />

Use druids charm, it is truly pathetic it comes to that. The mobs have 10k+ hps and double for 200 in ME, PoP is even worse, what warrior has a chance with that?</div></div><hr />

I think the toughest mobs I've tried are those sk spiders in PoD, not too tough once ToD procs. My war is at around 5k/1250 w/ druid and cobalt arms buffs and my druid has around 3800m unbuffed but usually still have KEI from the previous night's raiding. But really like was alrdy said probably the easiest xp you're going to get w/ that combo is charm and fear kiting.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kiya</div><div class="date">06-29-2003, 04:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye, the best way I've found with my 57 (2 ticks to 58 *twitches*) druid to duo with a melee is to fear kite or aggro kite.  My favorite spot for that right now is Western Wastes.  Fear kite animals til we get bored, then proceed to aggro kite Ice Burrowers. /cackle</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarelin</div><div class="date">06-30-2003, 12:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is feasible to duo, but as said above, its quicker exp to just root/dot, charm kite, quad kite with the Druid while the Warrior eats exp. I myself am a 65 warrior with 150aa's and its STILL faster for my 65 Druid to do this for me when I can't find a group!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kuvil</div><div class="date">06-30-2003, 12:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye, my old main was a 63 druid that  I have on another account.  After using him to get 1-50 out of the way, I went ahead and got group for 50-65.  Once you hit the planes, it starts to get to the point where mobs almost have to be slowed if you want to fight them, unless your like to med to regen mana alot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">06-30-2003, 02:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I get xp just fine 2 boxing with warrior tanking on anything that hits less then 600 quad ei potactics is great fun to box for me. Sol Ro tower mobs I can not. do dont have elemental flags yet.<br />
<br />
k for me xp is frigging good I am talking about about same xp rate as druid could get pre charm nerf solo its a lil worse then that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">06-30-2003, 05:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I could 2-box a 56 warrior and 53 cleric in Nightmare, it just took forever and was crappy exp.  I think as others have said, fastest way to get exp with that duo would be to just kite with the warrior in the group.  If someone was actually playing the warrior they could run along and beat on the mobs back while you did it, but you would have to be a much better 2-boxer than me to try to do that while kiting so just set the warrior on a wall someplace and make sure you're close to him when the mob dies.<br />
<br />
If the warrior was the main and the druid was a bot you could probably do it, but a 52 warrior in droppable gear isn't going to tank unslowed pop mobs very well.</div></div><hr />
