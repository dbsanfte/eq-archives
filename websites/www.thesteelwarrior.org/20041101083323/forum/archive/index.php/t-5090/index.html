<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bloodslake</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello<br />
<br />
I am looking to lead a raid to do Paffa.....if I can get the bad boy located and there isn't guild #265 already there.<br />
<br />
How do you check if Paffa is up in CoD?<br />
<br />
Is he trackable from ZI?<br />
<br />
What is the respawn on him from death?  <br />
<br />
Any special advice on the encounter?<br />
<br />
Thank You</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Slav</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Use eye of zomm to see if he is up. go left at first intersection and he is at the end in the last room.<br />
<br />
Advise DONT Step on the ramp to his room before you are ready to begin pulling.  Not even a SOS rogue.  it will trigger the ring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dubb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes, he's trackable from the zone, for any class that can track. Give it a try. If you fail, it will reset in ~30 minutes or less and you can try again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You'll find him a delightful encounter.  My prediction will be that, as your first try is wiping, someone will say, &quot;WTF?!?! Where did all those Greater Puslings come from!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bloodslake</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thank you for the replies.<br />
<br />
Any idea respawn time from death?<br />
<br />
I frequently obtain information on death time.  So I could at least be sure it will be up at a given time.<br />
<br />
Inny has some overcrowding issues.  Everything is contested it seems.<br />
<br />
Anyways, thanks for the replies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Findra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Pretty sure Paffa is a 24 hour respawn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ejryu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Paffa's 3 days, almost certain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bloodslake</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well, 1 or 3 days he was up last night.<br />
<br />
We gathered the forces and got in CoD to buff.  Crawled our way toward Paffa.<br />
<br />
We set up in the room outside his lair.<br />
<br />
When we pulled we got 10 puslings.  Well, we killed 7 before we were effectively wiped.  Thank Agnostic for SOS rogues.<br />
<br />
Anyways, Paffa &amp; da boys reverted back to the untouched state (the way they were supposed to be) and we reassembled.<br />
<br />
5 warriors were tanking w/ cleric on each tank.  When Paffa got targetable we rushed on him.<br />
<br />
It went very well as now the guild is Tier 2 on Innoruuk.<br />
<br />
Thank you for the information.:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grendonbb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hes 24 hours, we farmed him for like 2 months for his veil and earring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sikkorak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">24 hours.<br />
It's fun, and one of those things you can do with less and less people as you learn it well, and it will still stay challenging.<br />
<br />
Earring ? what earring ?  Done him 30 times + and 3 or 4 capes, rest all masks.  Not one earring.<br />
<br />
Poor necros.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>QuirtEvans</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Sounds like Lcea and her mask.  It's a theoretical drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Grendonbb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Yeah its a fight that I despise now... musta done him 40 times... veil dropped about 6 times, earring all of twice.  Rest of time gloves, shit cloaks.......... blah.</div></div><hr />
