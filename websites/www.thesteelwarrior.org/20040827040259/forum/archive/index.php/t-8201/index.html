<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Frig Coldheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I remember reading after the guild summit that SOE was considering putting in some solo or duo based LDoN adventures ? I am wondering if there has been anymore news on this ?<br />
<br />
I personally would like to see the adventures scale relative to the number in your group as well as the level of it. I think this would be nice for those people like myself that sometimes work odd hours and can play for maybe and hour or so early in the morning or late at night.<br />
<br />
It has been discussed in several other threads that LDoN is a usable way to progress for casual players and I think this addition might really help those people.<br />
<br />
What I was think is something like a normal LDoN slaughter type mission is kill around 60 mobs. So if you have a 3 persom group make it like 30 or 35. A 4 person group 40 or 45 etc.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
While we have stated that we are interested in the idea of solo adventure zones, there are no plans to add them in the near future.<br />
 <br />
Thanks all.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Frig Coldheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks for the replies guys. Sorry to hear this though. Just will have to get full groups all the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Northerner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Concept was amusing, but there really is no chance in hell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You dont need full groups to do adventures, we do normal LDoNs with 3-4 people, I did one with a shammy and a druid once, sometimes we have a BST or a ranger along, sometimes we do get a full group, but doesnt mean you need a full group :)<br />
<br />
Problem with solo adventures is that for a warrior to do one, you would need to put all green mobs :p</div></div><hr />
