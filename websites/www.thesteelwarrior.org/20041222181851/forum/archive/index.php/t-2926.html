<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kiztent</div><div class="date">09-08-2003, 09:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, based on some comments in this thread: http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=2814<br />
<br />
I decided to try a test.  Was in the deep with my enchanter, warrior ran out of arrows, so I said, hey, sure, I'll pull with slow.<br />
<br />
Huge difference.  Taunt was pulling off me cleanly, and more importantly, when I sat down afterwards, it was safe to sit.  Unlike landing a slow after pulls and wondering if you can sit safely.<br />
<br />
On a side note, with the shiftless deeds (level 44 slow - 61 percent slow at 56), no tash, a single GSoT proc locked aggro in any pulling scenario.  Once I saw the skulls, I sat down, no problems encountered at all.<br />
<br />
Mobs in the deep are all dark blue to 62 (as well as 56), hit in the 150s, no other abilities (except for a few casters).<br />
<br />
Second piece of information:<br />
<br />
I got to play warrior in Droga Saturday.  That is, no mana regen (KEI), I have the lifetap AAs so I don't use the mana proc, and I had to conserve mana since we were on an extended stay with a lot of fast pulling.  Since I was slowing, it made timing taunt easy.  Wacking taunt as soon as slow lands is a very effective tactic.  About half the time, you can count on the mob turning and that being the end of your aggro problems (was grouped with 2-3 necros, me and bot shaman and a druid for healing - didn't have any aggro problems with the necros and they were crowing about stacking 500 points per tick on every mob.  Frigging lunatics).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nothing new. Thats what each normal warrior will do ( taunt wenn mob is just slowed).<br />
<br />
And the Damage the necros stick is not really important.<br />
<br />
When I take my 62 necro (BA3) and cast funeral pyre ( 275 dmg ) , Pyrocruor (120 dmg) and Saryn's Kiss (191) I will rarely have aggro problems while dealing near 600 dmg/tic.<br />
<br />
But when I cast Envenomed Bolt (160 dmg ) and Cessation of Cor (113 dmg) I will nearly always grab aggro from a warrior and sometimes from a Knight for only 275 dmg/tic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomb</div><div class="date">09-08-2003, 10:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What you did is basically piggy back agro off the enchanter.<br />
The idea isnt really that new as it rather commonly used when several tank classes are in a group.<br />
Works usually very well for me when paladin's stun and i taunt off them (usually no agro problem for that fight).<br />
There are exceptions of course like a wizard landing a 6k+ crit right at the beginning but thats rare enough and if he is bright he will wait 6 seconds after i got agro assuming my taunt is up then.<br />
There are some problems with the concept though.<br />
<br />
1. Mobs that run faster than PC's or later on run 3.<br />
I think everyone loves NPC's using spirit of the wolf while PC's cant (and thats not that rare).<br />
<br />
2. Caster type mobs<br />
Dont you love getting dotted, snared or rooted on pulls ?<br />
<br />
3. Mobs with high resistance<br />
Try pulling in Plane of earth for example, a beastlord (we had no other slower and no debuffer either at least at first) had to try slow up to 8 times til it sticked.<br />
Our chanters were complaining a lot about resisted slows as well.<br />
<br />
If you taunt off the chanter you will have a sure agro compared to the rest of the group except the chanter who will have to try slow again.<br />
<br />
I have basically no problems with agro in Tier 1-3 or sol ro.<br />
Elementals are another matter though as described earlier but its depending on your group setup.<br />
<br />
If you watch your chat spat closely for the slow, tash, malo messages, you can make almost certain you have and keep agro.<br />
What you cannot see though is resists and thats where warriors usually have problems.</div></div><hr />
