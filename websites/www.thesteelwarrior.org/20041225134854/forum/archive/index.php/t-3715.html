My hp unbuffed is around 4500. I think im lacking a little more than 700hp?<br />

please help )</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ac is widely varied but I would say around 1250?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dugman</div><div class="date">10-17-2003, 10:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">On the other hand, not every warrior is in a guild, let alone a guild with Vex Thal access.  I'm unguilded for instance, level 63 with a full set of growth armor, PoP jewelry and some good auxiliary items.  I've seen ornate drop in BoT, so it's possible I'll have a piece or two by the time I'm 65, but not guaranteed.  And I've been having fun getting AAs along the way, so someone else who just races to 65 unguilded wouldn't even have that.<br />
<br />
For reference, worst case with no equipment upgrades, with ND3 at level 65 I'll have about 4550 hits and 1180 AC.  Odds are I'll have a few upgrades by then, though, so the actual numbers would be higher.<br />
<br />
<br />
Whether I'm average or not I don't know, but I can tell you I've seen people my level with worse equipment.  Heck, one guy posted here a while back who was 65th level with like 3600 hits!  So I wouldn't just assume everybody is running around in VT/Skyshrine/Ornate.  <br />
<br />
By the way, as a side note, at 63 with about 4200 hits I can tank just fine in BoT groups assuming I'm somewhat buffed.  So certainly if you're 65 with 4500-5000 hits you should be able to tank anything in that zone.  I don't think I'd want to try tanking the elemental planes, though, without some ornate or equivalent upgrades.</div></div><hr />

If you want to buy the RZ cultural armor.. and you can wear it, you can boost your HPs AC well.  There are other items you can get that are not VT raiding guilds items that will help.  The new items in LDoN are nice an can be augmented well.  I am sitting at about 5500 hps and 1326 ac, but have been extremely lucky to get an ornate BP on a guild BoT raid and a RZ helm.  I know I am below most of the warriors in my guild as far as stats go.  Plus my HP AA are almost maxed only short PD3.</div></div><hr />

If you take out pop and take out VT, yes it will be lower, that should be obvious.</div></div><hr />

You can check out my magelo for the numbers.  They are close minus a few augmentations....dropped not purchased.  This is in mostly ornate, FH, and the Thurgadin quest BP....at least until I finish out the points for the LDoN one that is. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dracillion</div><div class="date">10-17-2003, 11:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm probably a good example of an average 65, in a pre elemental gear, and in a fairly active raiding guild.  I don't play or raid as much as our hardcore folks, so I don't have the DKP or items that a lot of them have.  I'm also a tad behind as I took off 8 months and just came back in July.  I have 1431AC and 6030 hps unbuffed.  I have 3 VT items, and some nice stuff, but in NO way is my stuff insane.  My hp AAs are maxed except for PP.  So I'd agree with Myst, maybe around 1300-1450AC and 5900-6200 HPs would be an average, pre-elemental Warrior.  (this is assuming your in a guild that does VT, Luclin Bosses, AoW, PoP pre-elemental gods etc.) <br />
<br />
I guess the question is what type of guild you are in and what your play style is?  If your not in a VT/raid type guild, you probably won't reach 6K hps unbuffed pre-elemental.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm in a VT guild (still haven't gotten a single VT loot yet though), and I'm running about 6100-6250 unbuffed hps (1330ish AC) depending on weapon selection. I do have Emperor neck, Seru BP, and Agnarr earring though.<br />
<br />
Click my magelo if you want to see how I did it. Note there is still plenty of room for improvement as well.<br />
<br />
Also note I count food items (Halas pies and Grobb Liquidised Meat) because I use them all the time. They really aren't that expensive when you consider how long they last. I just pick up some in the bazaar when I run low, I don't bother with the trade skilling itself.</div></div><hr />

Actually Im equiped in High-end luclin with no VT (though we do have access) and I reach 6640 unbuffed or close to that....just look at my magelo.  Its about maxed pre-VT.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Non raiding guild I would say 5khp 1250AC is possible.<br />
<br />
NToV/ST warrrior is about 5300HP 1300-1350AC<br />
<br />
SSRA/VT 6100-6500HPS 1400AC<br />
<br />
PoP 7khps + 1500ac+ depending on where at in PoP youre at.<br />
<br />
These are just numbers off the top of my head, and from looking at magelos of warriors at different spots in the game. They will vary based on diety and whether you have any Ornate etc.<br />
<br />
Im in a guild at NToV/St level with 5600hps 1280AC. I also have RZ armor and Ornate mix so my numbers will be a bit inflated for this stage of the game.</div></div><hr />

I have a stamina aug that boosts my magelo a little bit, but not to much.  1212 AC unbuffed as an Iksar so that may help me out a bit, but with my gear, SkyShrine, I plan to top out 5k unbuffed once i get 65 and some more AA.  Although if I can get my hands on some ornate, that will boost me close to 6k.</div></div><hr />

This set up will get you around 5550hp and 1265ac. Everything can be 1 grouped or bought in the bazaar. The only item you would be forced to buy if you are not flagged would be the neck since it drops in Sol Ro. Everything else anyone 62+ should be able to camp themselves.</div></div><hr />

This quote matches the warriors in my guild, we're pre-VT but done with NTOV, doing mostly Ssra-equivalent POP stuff at this point.  Average equipment slot probably has 65-70 hp, some more, some less.<br />
<br />
As Terrorus and Mofu said, you can do better than this from pre-VT/elemental targets and probably reach 6700 hp or more (TZ mask, Agnarr gloves, VZ neck, AOW helm, acid bracers, bloodfrenzy, etc).</div></div><hr />

I just looked at your magelo. Your legs,earrings and bow are  POP tradeskill or drops.<br />
<br />
So you are in line with the comment I made. Notice I said VT and POP, you have pop gear and tradeskill items.<br />
<br />
Make sure you check the details :) Nice Magelo though.<br />

EDIT:And technically the charm is POP as well.</div></div><hr />

Well if you want to get technical, you can get +100hp legs from shei and seru, you can get the iron cog earring from the gnome event (100hp and droppable) and the lizard bone earrings from CT (75hp).  Cursed drops a 110HP ranged item for all melee.  All are better than mine and still pre VT and PoP.  :)<br />
<br />
And thanks for the compliment :)<br />

EDIT:  Seru is a fricken gold mine..farm the shit out of him.   14day respawn is the suck though.</div></div><hr />

Everything on my warrior is obtainable by one group, either via fighting or simply plat purchasing.  I also did HoT single group and in about 1-2weeks of 4 hour nights managed to deck 6 folks in complete SS armor (minus a couple of pieces, but nothing big).  Almost a complete set of plate drops every other raid.<br />
<br />
I now have PE and planar durability maxxed, putting me over the 5K mark.  A guild should be able to achieve much more than I have, so it is all up from my magelo.<br />
<br />
The only pieces, which I just added, my mask and off-hand were done while tagging along with another guild.  I had grimling contraption on my face before, which is not much less HP wise.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
This is pretty close to the set up I'm doing.  Just one comment, though - I wouldn't call camping a full set of ornate armor &quot;not too hard to come by&quot;.  So far in BoT I've seen one piece of ornate drop in about 8 or 10 mini-boss kills, and I lost the roll.  And there's enough competition for these minis that I can't always get into a group killing them.<br />
<br />
You're correct, though, that after a very long time camping you can get most or all of the ornate pieces from BoT/HoH.  You can also get equivalent LDoN armor for about 40 adventures a piece.  For someone playing a couple hours a day, both prospects will take a long time but can be done.</div></div><hr />

I'm in a guild that has just started HoT, and while I've got a few nice items from raiding with a friend's guild (Breastplate of Eradication) most of my stuff is Kael/PoG gear, nothing special. I have ND3 but that's it for HP AAs. When I had ND2, I was sitting at around 4500 unbuffed, so assuming you're not in an high end guild and that you don't have the money for ornate or the nicest gear, you're probably a little above average.</div></div><hr />
