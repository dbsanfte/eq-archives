<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ayash</div><div class="date">09-09-2003, 08:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Warrior and Magician epic changes –– A new version of these two epic items is available to accommodate the new item augmentations. Both of these epics are basically summoned items, and therefore they would lose any augmentations when used or unsummoned. Players wishing to change these items into &quot;permanent&quot; versions in order to augment them should do the following:  <br />
<br />
<br />
 Warrior Epic - Talk to Gartrog Smitehammer in East Freeport. He will replace your Red Scabbard and Jagged Blade of War with augmentable versions of the Jagged Blade of War, the Blade of Strategy, and the Blade of Tactics. You will not receive the Red Scabbard back, as it will no longer be useful to you. <br />
<br />
Interesting, looking forward to this</div></div><hr />

I want to thank SoE for addressing Warrior concerns. While others thought you had abandoned us, I knew that these things take time.<br />

Wheeeee, I'm soooo happy!!<br />

Rotfl, that was exactly what I was thinking.<br />

Is that really how much we've been negleted? lol</div></div><hr />

I know you're being sarcastic, and was funny, but the sad truth is that this is the only upgrade we've gotten in 5+ months. In fact, I dare say that the last warrior upgrade was /shield....<br />
<br />
And I would be one of the &quot;Bad Warriors&quot; that does not use this ability. Not because it is not useful, as a warrior who actually takes the time to get used to it and explains to every exp group and every raid how it works and actually gets them to listen, could actually save some lives. But because it was a sad excuse of an attempt at balancing, when other class continue to get cool shit.<br />
<br />
If I had my way....<br />
Endless Quiver<br />
Feign Death<br />
Innate Aggro<br />
A line of Taunt Skills, not just one and an AA version<br />
Hand to Hand weapons<br />
AA ability to duel weild 2h weapons and/or 2h weapon/shield<br />
<br />
And I would also revamp bind wounds, along with putting a type of bandages on the Global Forage Table, because with the amount of people on each Norrath, Luclin, and Heavenly Plane, there has got to be ALOT of old wrappers from food and junk laying around.</div></div><hr />

You need to turn in the Red Scabbard and the 2HS version of the epic and not have the 2 1HS versions in your inventory anywhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draxus Diablus</div><div class="date">09-09-2003, 12:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That assumes that the swords will be identical.  They will not, one will be the augmentable version &amp; the other will be summoned.  That's no guarantee they will not be considered lore, but that's no guarantee they will either.</div></div><hr />

I destroy the summoned blades and turn in the Red Scabbard and the Jagged Blade of War and in turn receive The Jagged Blade of War (2HS), The Blade of Stratagy and The Blade of Tactics. These 3 swords will be augmentable.<br />
<br />
Correct.<br />
<br />
Just got my epic a few months ago after 18 months of working on it and just don't want anything to go wrong on the turn in :-)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Useless now apparently with LDoN but you could make your epic 2HS then get a summoned sword of runes from a mage, stick it in the red scabbard and combine to make the two 1HS epics and have all three without carrying the scabbard around and combining every time you wanted to switch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You just make sure you have both 2hs and the red and blue before you do hand in. After the hand in, you have 2hs, 2 reds, and 2 blues.</div></div><hr />

They just should have made the 1H 14/20 and the 2H 41/41, which is a marginal upgrade but it is Kunark after al.<br />
<br />
An other solution would have been to add 2 augmentation slots.<br />
<br />
Anyhow non of the two very obvious upgrades took place. Again a missed chance.<br />

I bet I'm gonna be doing a lot of trying to equip my 2h in my secondary slot now.  They could have at least made the icons reflect the colors on the blades, rather than just make them all look similar.  Disappointing.</div></div><hr />

This was the chance for making the Epics on par with the weapons from Droga (also Kunark).   Technically, SOE has had the past 3 years to make epics good...<br />
<br />
But the weapons coming out of Droga could hardly be called &quot;Kunark&quot; weapons.  While the zone does reside in Kunark, the whole zone has been updated recently, and pretty much all of the equipment that drops in there beats the pants off of equivalent level stuff in the same expansion...except MAYBE some of Sebilis and the other Kunark zones that have been revamped.  I'd consider them more PoP/LDoN era weapons instead...one of the weapons has &quot;Planar Strike&quot; as the proc for crying out loud. :D<br />
<br />
Any chance of getting a picture of an iksar with both red blades? :cool:</div></div><hr />

If you still use epic, you get a great offhander (caus blue sucked bigtime)<br />
If you dont use epic, it doesnt concern you (you have better).</div></div><hr />

Same as any poor ratio combo: Even with chain procs I lost aggro in 15 seconds.  Still looks owny with 2 red or 2 blue though $$.</div></div><hr />

I now have 5 epic reward swords... the effects on the blues stack, whoopie,... the 2 reds didnt seem to proc enough to make up for the 24 delay, so back in I switched my bloodsworn. <br />
What i want to know is this... <br />
these weapons can now be &quot;augmented&quot; once slot each. will any of the augmentations available be, say, 10 magic dmg added to 2 hand weapons.... or effect &quot;Engulfing Darkness&quot; (combat).... or -5 delay... ? <br />
what can we actually do to them, is what i want to know... the 2 hander is weak dmg, the 1 handers are too slow.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyhow, on the off topic, topic... of EQ... god I want that AA SO BAD.  I have to constantly beg mages for arrows.  Lately I've been asking rangers to make me arrows in their exp groups... but guess what... 100% of rangers over lvl 60 do NOT have Tolan's Bracer anymore and can't make arrows! WTF!  <br />
<br />
I've been watching the bazaar just so that I can buy a Tolan's bracer, so that I can force rangers to make me arrows... but they've been around 10k lately... which seems like quite a lot...</div></div><hr />
