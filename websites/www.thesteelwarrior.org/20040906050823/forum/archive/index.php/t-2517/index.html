<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>CATEIRE</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, I’ve read through these posts the last few days until I, actually, could not blink my eyes. Of course, there has actually been absolutely no progress in the debate of warrior balancing. So, I decided to come up with a healthy number of simple yes or no, fact or fiction statements and, questions. Mind you I am referring to the average player here, not the end game player, nor the occasional player.  First I’d like to begin with my facts. <br />
<br />
	Fact:Warrior’s taunt is broke. <br />
<br />
	Fact: Having to depend on chanter + hate spells or weapon procs is a crutch.<br />
<br />
	Fact: In an experience setting, our disciplines are hardly used enough to be considered as a utility or group benefit. <br />
<br />
	Fact: The average Warrior DPS is nominal in fact quite laughable at times. <br />
<br />
	Fact: If a Warrior is not tanking he is dead weight and can be replaced by ANY class.<br />
<br />
	Fact: Perception is everything, if it is perceived that the Warrior class are second rate tanks and has less than adequate agro management, they will get second rate exp.<br />
<br />
	Fact: Warriors have no utility thus killing any sort of “plate” stacking unless it’s a group of friends or there is no other option at the time of group creation. <br />
<br />
	Fact: Warriors are COMPLETELY group dependant for any kind of exp. <br />
<br />
Ok, a few fictions.<br />
<br />
	Fiction: The only job, in an experience setting, for a Knight should be to tank. Numerous roles are out there just the knights are primarily selected for the tank slot. <br />
<br />
	Fiction: A Knight’s spell book doesn’t land them groups. (I have been in countless groups that have enlisted a Knight for their utilities be it the SK FD or the Pally Heals.)  <br />
<br />
	Fiction: Knights need to be nerfed. <br />
<br />
	Fiction: All Warriors get to tank Boss Mobs.<br />
<br />
	Fiction: All Warriors have access to the weapons or PP needed to effectively tank in an experience setting. <br />
<br />
At last a few Questions. <br />
<br />
1.	Why when grouping with a War should the other members of a group have to hold back.<br />
<br />
When I play my 65 warrior with 70+ AA I get to play ALL OUT I am holding nothing back because if I do I lose agro and players Die. But in order for the group to function correctly and smoothly the other players have to hold back. Yet when they play with a Knight tanking, they get to enjoy the Full power of there class by going all out on every mob.  <br />
<br />
2.	How does nerfing the Knight class fix Warrior agro? <br />
<br />
Nobody likes a nerf; the Knights in this game pay the same amount of money every month to play this game just like me. I chose the path of a Warrior because it was my choice no one made me do it. But as this game has evolved there is a disparity in the two classes that have given the knights an advantage that is what needs to be addressed. Warrior agro needs to be increased some how, smacking the Knights with a nerf bat will NOT fix this.  <br />
<br />
3.	Why is it now harder for me at 65 with 70+ AA and slightly above average weapons to hold agro than it was at 40 fighting Drolvargs in DL?<br />
<br />
  <br />
And finally a summary:<br />
<br />
I love playing my warrior I have slightly above average weapons average AA and I have been playing for quite a while. There have always been class disparities between the plate tank classes. But, the current state of affairs is simply frustrating for the Warrior class. Why is simple. The uncontested agro management of the Knights has left the Warriors far behind when it comes to exp groups. Even grouped with skilled players it is a chore for a warrior to get and keep agro. The warrior can only maintain agro IN AVERAGE SETTINGS at the expense of the rest of the group members holding back. A warrior brings NO utility to a group if it already has a tank. All MELE only characters are completely gear and group dependant.  It is time for the war class to be addressed by the Developers. We need to put down our silly pre pubescent petty arguments and seriously come up with a tangible fix that would address our core needs as warriors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Mostly I'd go along with that except the statement that the only way to go forward is to increase warrior taunt to knight like levels.<br />
<br />
The disparity between knight and warrior aggro generation needs to be addressed. This can just as easily be accomplished by a nerf as by a boost. <br />
<br />
Group members having to hold back a little is not a great evil :p<br />
Why do group members have to hold back in an exp group? Same reason slow aggro is supposed to be a factor in a group. Balance. <br />
<br />
Being able to burn down a mob in nought seconds flat and raking in the massive exp sounds great on paper but if your actions have no consequences and the mob sticks to the tank like glue then the whole exp. situation becomes a pretty pointless dronefest (surely it's 'bad' enough already? ). Granted that isn't quite the case with knights yet but it's getting close. Too close imho.<br />
<br />
My personal opinion is their needs to be a bit of both - unassisted warrior taunt needs to be boosted some perhaps providing 'slightly' more personal control, whilst knight aggro needs to be toned down to a more 'appropriate' level wether by hate reductions, increased mana costs, changes to the situation that alter how hate is applied, whatever. <br />
<br />
/shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Just to add what Val said, as far as group members holding back.  I have a 63 mage alt, and I prefer to group with her as opposed to solo, and I can tell you without question that I do the same damage, and cast the same spells, with either a knight or warrior tanking.  I time them differently, but I still get them all in.  It takes very little skill to manage your agro.  Mages can nuke fairly well, and get no form of concussion to reduce agro.<br />
<br />
I will admit that DoT classes might have to be a little more carefull, but necro's have FD, and can stack on their DoT's, take a couple hits, FD, get up and life tap back to full health.  See it frequently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">thing is agro isnt broken on warriors in the conventional sense, the problem is intangable and requires drastic changes to our class to fix,<br />
<br />
the problem is when grouping with a knight, a group may go all out, when grouping with a warrior they must hold back, now holding back means less exp so since the only thing that changed is the warrior in place of a pally, we are not as effeciant as a paladin, there by obsolete, balance in this game used to rely on the multifaceted abilitys of a class, warrior arnt multifaceted so if anyone steps on our tanking power, we are SoL.<br />
<br />
we have to be put on top of the pile, or the pile has to be boiled down to our level for us to be of any use<br />
--<br />
<br />
red, it doesnt matter what the mage/wiz does, as far as PoP groups go, thats a enterchangable slot, now all that is truly required is a cleric and a BL, or a shaman and a cleric, or a shaman and a post 62 druid.<br />
<br />
thing is when they get agro from their dots/slows or heals, they die really fast, slight exception with the shaman, but then your main healer heals the shaman and boom, s/he is down now, shaman is next and then the mob picks at left overs.<br />
<br />
want to fix groups?(not gameplay)<br />
up warrior agro, or bring down slow agro, because its usally the shaman and his/her healer that is upset with you and also the group leaders, i play with many people and i can only think of 2 shaman's that know their jobs, and im glad to say they are in my guild :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Gerick, let me reiterate...when playing my caster, I do not  have to hold back, I simply adjust my timing.  Mana regen is a greater limiting factor(even at the ungodly rates mana can be regenerated these days) than agro.  I can also tell you from my experiences playing a caster that mobs do not  die significantly faster in exp groups with a knight tank.  I cannot give you an exact count of how many mobs do die per hour with each, but I am willing to state that the class tanking has no significant impact on kill rates.<br />
<br />
The one major reason knights are preferred to warriors is that I do not have to worry about timing my nukes with a warrior.  Cast Mal on inc, then my rain spell, then one or two strait nukes, and sit and play with the cat, or talk on the phone while group finishes mob off.  With a warrior, I have to space them a bit, and it takes a bit more attention.  <br />
<br />
Knights are also a lot safer than warriors.  I am far less likely to get summoned in and hit on with a knight tanking, tho if I am paying attention, it usually is not an issue.  Slowers do not have as much luxury, but a good slower will either plan to get hit, and be ready to do what is neaded to stay alive, or learn to time things so they do not often get hit.<br />
<br />
thing is when they get agro from their dots/slows or heals, they die really fast <br />
<br />
Note the comment above, they can eaither time things better, or plan for it.  A good slower will rarely ever die, a bad one will often.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gyrfalcon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Redhenna, you have illustrated perfectly for us why Knights are now the preferred tank.  It has been many a time when I have joined a pickup group to see the comments in group tell go something like this:<br />
<br />
caster1: Did you get a pally? Please tell me this guy is a pally.<br />
caster2: Nope, all I could find was a warrior<br />
caster1: Suxxors<br />
<br />
And I have to proceed from there and earn the trust of the group I am in, time my taunts as well as possible, and be ready to shield if my taunt doesn't pull the mob to me. Our problem is as much perception as reality, perception that we are a gimped tank class because of our limited agro generation capabilities, and the reality that our agro generation capabilities has NEVER BEEEN UPGRADED since this game was created other than through item fixes that less than five percent of us are able to see.<br />
<br />
It takes a little more skill these days to play a warrior in PoP zones, and a hell of a lot more patience waiting to get a tell for a group. Truth be told, those warriors who say there is no problem are probably in big guilds where there is always an xp group with a spot for him or her. Half the time I play, this is the case, but for the other half of the time, I am whoring myself in PoT begging for a group spot, competing wih Knights 2 or 3 levels lower than me and watching them get groups before I do. Hell, I have even resorted to joining tier 2 and tier 1 groups in PoP because I got tired of waiting, or have logged on to an alt (my monk is 35 now) just to combat boredom.<br />
<br />
How do we fix he problem? Don't nerf Knights, then we will be back to where we started, with Knights screaming bloody murder. Instead, give warriors the agro generation tools that we should have had at the beginning of SoL, and make sure it isn't an item fix that only a few of us will get. Upgrading anyone with a spellbook is easy, give them new spells. Upgrading anyone who doesn't have a spellbook requires more work. Item fixes usually suck because then the drops are farmed (sorry SOE, but you may not believe in player camps, but that does not make them go away) and the only way to find what you need is to spend your horded cache in the bazaar, which depletes the funds for other upgrades. I personally don't have 350Kpp to buy an EB weapon, and my guild is not strong enough yet to go fight a boss that drops an EB weapon (if Uber Guild X hasn't already farmed the boss in question). Besides, I would be third or fourth in line if we could. No, the fix needs to be an innate ability in warriors, maybe a new skill or discipline.<br />
<br />
I think I have said too much already on this, and really, I don't think SOE will ever fix this problem. All I can say is that I have spent over three years leveling my warrior, only to see that in my post-50 experience, that the casters around me leveled twice as fast as I did while I sat waiting for groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Gerick, let me reiterate...when playing my caster, I do not have to hold back, I simply adjust my timing.<br />
<br />
This may be true, as a Mage.  But my reading leads me to believe it's not true with classes that use dots as a primary form of damage, Necros and Druids as prime examples, they have to hold back a great deal.  And I hear tell, read it in a thread on PoN, that there is a dot being released in LDoN that will being doing something like 530 damage a tick for 6 ticks.  Now, who will be able to use that when grouped with a Warrior?</div></div><hr />

Could be close to 500 with Focus's and the what not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">By all indication Taunt is working as intended.  There is no skill in the game that can turn a monster quicker onto you than Taunt.<br />
<br />
The problem is the mechanics of Taunt allow for a 50%-60% failure.  Waiting for refresh is the killer.  Its not broken so much as it is unkind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">i call bullshit on that aeka, wanna play cards sometime? because your yet another cuddled paladin who never had to rely on it totally, you dont see the flaws, the only class with out a alternate method of getting agro is warriors, we have 1 way to do it that is built in, and as such we pay ALOT more attention to weather its &quot;working as intended&quot;<br />
<br />
and red, i wasnt disagreeing with you, i was talking about priest classes that use dots, i didnt go on to say much about mages and wizzies.<br />
<br />
Sad thing is the good cleric, the good shaman, the good (insert here) is rarly in your group, and most people in pick up groups are chuckle fucks who think that its the warriors fault THEY pissed the mob off to much</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Gerick, try actually reading what people are saying before simply attacking them because of the class they play. You just end up looking like an ass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I've recently been able to play casters in XP groups, and I tell you one thing, it's really opened my eyes as to how bad warriors really are. At the beginning of the fight playing a chanter against a BoWar wielding warrior just as an example, I was consistently getting aggro. Or if I wanted to not get aggro, I needed to spend a lot more mana, and/or wait a lot longer to cast. Against hybrids, there were no problems.<br />
<br />
GD LDoN NDA... I got more to say but I can't say it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Well, got to agree with the Cleric on this one.   My reading of what Aeka was saying is that taunt does what it's supposed to do, it's just that what it's supposed to do isn't really enough anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Graal the Dorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I really, really think they should just up the success rate of taunt dramatically and lengthen the refresh timer. 85% chance of success (as opposed to 55-60%) and a 10 second timer (as opposed to 6) would make the taunt skill 3 times more successfull but also make it slightly more painful for mistiming a taunt or for those who just mash. Or, if people don't like the increased refresh timer, just raise the success rate of taunt to 75%. that would be about a 45-50% reduction in failures of taunt.<br />
<br />
Personally, I don't like no cost skills with very quick refresh timers. The only cost to those skills IS the refresh timer.<br />
<br />
The taunt skill itself is the best method for gaining aggro in the game...assuming it is successfull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sivok Kovis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Well even that sucks, we will still have a chance of failure where knights wont. We would only be less of a pain to group with, but still not the best choice overall. (speaking MT wise here)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Apothes Drudoll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The taunt skill itself is the best method for gaining aggro in the game...assuming it is successfull.<br />
<br />
I would disagree with that statement because if the person that had previous aggro sits then aggro goes back to them, where as 2 stuns guarantees aggro stays on me even through the person that had aggro sitting. So spell aggro is best for gaining aggro in the game.<br />
<br />
Although it can be a toss up if the people in the group know how to control aggro then the person that had aggro will not sit right away. But judging from all the posts I have read people want to be lazy and want aggro lock the the best way to get aggro in the game with the current thinking now a days is through spell aggro.<br />
<br />
As we all know ther eis no chance for spell aggro to fail no if's and's or but's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">My reading of what Aeka was saying is that taunt does what it's supposed to do, it's just that what it's supposed to do isn't really enough anymore. <br />
<br />
I'm afraid I disagree on that &quot;doin what it is supposed to do&quot;.  <br />
<br />
I think the on-going science project on taunt contained on this thread <br />
<br />
http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=1811<br />
<br />
Has really uncovered alot of strange functionality in the workings taunt.  Clearly there are elements of taunt that are not working correctly from a real world mechanics level (for example the mysterious &quot;4 taunt pattern&quot;).  <br />
<br />
I submit (once again) that taunt is broken possibly not only from a design sense but from an application sense as well.  Without a thorough review of how it is implemented technically there can be NO meaningful tuning of the design.  Without this tuning/assessment there really can not be any meaningful discussion of class balance (which entails a change to the design or at least an evaluation of how the design is performing against its intended performance).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I really meant no disrespect.  I seriously see Taunt as working exactly the way as it is designed.  The problem is it isn't good enough any more.<br />
<br />
The only reason Taunt exists in the game is because the original EQ engine doesn't support server side object collisions.  All collision detection the player sees is done by the client (which leads to some early specular hacks).  There is now som rudimentary enforcement of &quot;space&quot; but it is far from complete.<br />
<br />
So what does this have to do with Taunt?  Well the very idea of tanking goes something like this....<br />
<br />
<br />
Burniator ---&gt; &lt;----Aeka {some distance behind}  Glassjaw Enchanter<br />
<br />
<br />
Simply put as a tank you want to put yourself between Burniator and Glassjaw.  How do you accomplish this when &quot;space&quot; is not enforced?  Enter Taunt!<br />
<br />
Taunt simulates blocking the monster from reaching whatever it is it really should be attacking.  In a sense offering yourself as the only target.  Taunt failures represent &quot;misteps&quot; in covering your friends.<br />
<br />
Because of SOE's &quot;black box design&quot; philosophy on Melee no one is really sure of the mechanics of Taunt.  Best fit description of Taunt works something like this.<br />
<br />
1. The monster remembers who did what on an agro list.  It is ordered by who does the most anoying stuff.<br />
<br />
2. Players as they interact (read: try to kill the monster ^_^) they can move up and down this list.<br />
<br />
3. The monster selects a target to attack from the top of the list.  If the monster can move it will close the distance.  If the monster can summon at the moment then it will summon.  If that target is &quot;unavailable&quot; it will select the next one on the list.<br />
<br />
4. What does Taunt do?  Taunt if successful will make the monster ignore the list and replace the Taunter at the target to attack.<br />
<br />
Taunt itself appears to not appear to add hate.  It only tells the monster to ignore the agro list for a moment.<br />
<br />
This may not be exactly what happens behind the scenes but it seems like an accurate model and accounts for a lot of behavior seen in the game.  It isn't perfect because it doesn't explain certain choices the monster makes (when does a monster summon?  when does a monster move?  where does low health figure in?).  In any event Taunt is a powerful skill.  We take it for granted every day a skill that basically rewires the simplistic AI of monsters.<br />
<br />
However even as powerful as Taunt is it sucks that Warrior's mainline strategy is to use it constantly.  It should have been a &quot;last resort&quot; instead of a &quot;first attempt&quot;.<br />
<br />
edit: bleck...I hate it when I hit submit too soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Nice summary of taunt, but I have one question as to why you said something..maybe I am just being dense.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Taunt itself appears to not appear to add hate. It only tells the monster to ignore the agro list for a moment. <br />
<br />
It has always been my understanding that taunt in fact did add hate, enough to place you on top of hate list, pus a little bit.  Why do you say that it does not actually add hate?  Note, I am not trying to be argumentative, just curious.<br />
<br />
Gerick, as Aeka was pointing out, taunt is working(at least mostly, the new taunt tests don't seem to show it broken, only that it works slightly different than we thought, and there is one possible area that hate itself might be at issue...least last I looked, no one had confirmed or disproven the possibility of hate wrapping) as it was designed.  It is not broken, it just can be a most frustrating skill, especially the way the EQ RNG works.<br />
<br />
Glatius, DoT classes do in fact have to watch what they are doing more(I don't play a druid, but have a druid best friend who tells me that she gets her DoT's in no prob with a warrior tanking, not sure if druid DoT's are lesser agro or not...but anyway, necro's and shaman have more of an issue).  Necro's can FD their DoT agro off, and shaman simply can take a few hits from a slowed mob from DoTing, Q themselves, and canni and still be running good for mana.  The basic comment I was working for is that, when I play my caster, exp moves at about the same rate with a warrior and a knight MA.  Kill rates are not significantly faster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">There were ancient posts which I've long lost that covered this topic.<br />
<br />
The setup was a caster (a Wizard with a tash/debuf/spam stick) would anoy the heck out of a low risk monster.   The Wizard should have a huge amount of agro yet a Warrior would be able to come up and hit Taunt to make the monster turn on him.  The interesting side effect was noticed that after a bit (remember no one was doing damage) the monster would go back to chasing the Wizard which seems to imply that agro levels are preserved (the Warrior had none while the Wizard had a ton).  The model I described was used to explain this behavior.<br />
<br />
I would love to see this experiment run again.  It would be great to reaffirm or see if there are differences in agro performance now as opposed to then.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">The reason why the experiement was run this way was to show the difference in agro level which simulates in game fight conditions.  A caster has high agro.  Your tank has lower agro.  What does the monster do?  How useful is Taunt?<br />
<br />
The thing I took away, reguardless of the interptation of the model, is that Taunt can over come huges amounts of agro but the effect is brief.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I am not aware of any abilities that only modifies the hate list on a temporary basis.  I have never heard of anyone taunting a mob successfully, and then if everyone does absolutely nothing, the mob somehow decides to go switch to another target.  There are fights where I inherit a lot of hate from the previous people via AE taunt.  I have never had a case where the mob spontaneously decided to go hit someone else which would happen a lot if the hate I inherited runs out.  I have seen warriors freshly rezzed taking aggro with AE Taunt and able to hold aggro for a while (they eventually lose it to rez effect typically).  This would not be possible if aggro inherited from Taunt is temporary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Did you turn off attack right when you Taunt?  Many forget that they attack in melee while using Taunt which generates hate.<br />

That is the reason why the experiment was conducted this way.  Neither the Wizard or the Warrior were doing hate generating actions after the initial setup in an effort to perserve different hate levels(the Wizard with high hate, the Warrior with low hate).  One question asked was to see if &quot;hate decay&quot; through inaction happens as a natural function of time or because others leap over you.<br />

Of course this was way way way back when.  I think it was around the first changes to Taunt due to problems.  This is the reason why I would love someone to rerun the thing to see if anything changed.  If nothing else it can confirm what players think about agro and how it relates to Taunt in a slightly different setup than &quot;one on one&quot; fights.</div></div><hr />

I really, really think they should just up the success rate of taunt dramatically and lengthen the refresh timer. 85% chance of success (as opposed to 55-60%) and a 10 second timer (as opposed to 6) would make the taunt skill 3 times more successfull but also make it slightly more painful for mistiming a taunt or for those who just mash. Or, if people don't like the increased refresh timer, just raise the success rate of taunt to 75%. that would be about a 45-50% reduction in failures of taunt.<br />
<br />
Personally, I don't like no cost skills with very quick refresh timers. The only cost to those skills IS the refresh timer.<br />
<br />
The taunt skill itself is the best method for gaining aggro in the game...assuming it is successfull.  <br />
<br />
there is just so much i want to say in regards to this...<br />
<br />
upping the success rate... no other skill, ability, spell if they failed as often as taunt would EVER be acceptable. ON GREEN TRIVIAL mobs, it has been shown to FAIL 40%+ or non trivial blue,yellow, red mobs, I would hate to see the fail rate. SoE convieniently has left any good way to test this as all the 'GoD' mobs are too dumb to talk anymore...<br />
<br />
Refresh timer increased... LOL one fail and the cleric/shamn/slower is dead for sure in PoP. 10 secs with an unslowed PoP mob... LOADING PLEASE WAIT... followed shortly by.. You have left the group... If Anything the refresh timer should DECREASE with skill/level. Hell let me get AA's to lower the timer by 10/2050%<br />
<br />
Other classes have recieved aa's to lower their refresh times, why not warriors and taunt? Hell Rangers get innate camo 5 sec refresh! Monks get Rapid Feign... why not rapid taunt?<br />
<br />
You want to increase our Taunt timer... that would GIMP us even more compared to knights, with taunt + 3 stun spells...</div></div><hr />
