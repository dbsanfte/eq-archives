<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Behemot</div><div class="date">05-06-2004, 07:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
I have a question regarding aggro, I hope someone can answer it.<br />
<br />
I usually dualbox an enchanter. I pull a mob on plane of fire with incite from 2nd castle. Incite generates 400 aggro, it takes 3-4 ticks while the mob gets to the camp, so it's 3x70=210 more aggro. So, I'm supposed to have 600 aggro on the mob.<br />
<br />
While the mob is coming, my chanter casts Tashani on the mob. It is 500 aggro. I have a focus which reduces Tash aggro by 20 percent, also have spell casting subtley which reduces aggro further by 20%. So the Tashani generates a total of 500 x 0.6 = 300 aggro.<br />
<br />
In all cases, my chanter gets on top of the aggro list.<br />
<br />
And, this is going on since 1 month. All before, when incite was introduced, I could safely incite and tash, and chanter never got the aggro.<br />
<br />
So what's wrong here? Incite is bugged/nerfed? Or aggro does not work as I would think?</div></div><hr />

I'd suggest that as being the most likely culprit. Other than that, there is of course the possibility that aggro reductions could have been borked at some point, though I have no idea on that. You might want to try pulling with an arrow, then inciting and seeing if that helps as well. I've noticed that the initial hate of incite seems to be lessened when you use it to initially aggro a mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neksnappa</div><div class="date">05-06-2004, 08:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pulling with incite usually means you get within range of something, and hit incite so it runs to you. I'm not positive if any parsings have been done, or even if they are necessary, but it is the consensus of many that incite generates very very low aggro when not used in melee range. If you want to get tash off as early as possible and not get the chanter beat on, either have the war run right up to a mob, smack it once, and incite before returning, or maybe root the mob as it is running towards you with the chanter (not sure if root is viable/possible though, sorry).<br />
<br />
Edit: I've tried tagging with an arrow for initial aggro, and then using incite while the mob is still a ways off. The first spell cast still causes the mob to ignore me however, so I think it's probably just the range issue with incite aggro, not just initial hate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Buuhmann</div><div class="date">05-06-2004, 08:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I also pull with incite / bellow of the mastruqu in fire field2 / castle2 and i have 90% of the time  agro over the tashing chanter (she has sublety too and is standing like 50 feet behind me when i tank). <br />
But remember: If i pull with incite and somebody tags my mob with a non agro spell (dispell) or   an arrow, he usually is agro when i run over him and stop behind him, out of the mob's melee range.  Also if my bard puller pulls with anull, runs to the camp, i incite and he stops in front of me, his agro proximity agro is always bigger than bellow + my proximity agro. However if he runs past me and stops out of the melee range of the mob, he never gets beaten.<br />
<br />
Don't underestimate proximity agro. <br />
<br />
And yes, I think incite agro is the same numbers, regardless in what situation you use it. In the above PoFire situation my ench tashes when the mob is still running and begins to cast slow when the mob gets in my melee range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">05-06-2004, 01:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Part of the problem is proximity I would imagine, but the other part is that your math is wrong. 3-4 ticks to pull a mob?? Are you pulling mobs across the zone or what? I can't think of any place in PoFire that take 18-24 seconds for the mob to get to you once you have agro. I'd be surprised if the 2nd tick of incite hits before the mob is in camp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">05-06-2004, 02:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would suggest using an arrow to pull the mob then tagging the mob again with incite once it gets closer to you.  This might be more agro than just simply using incite to pull. Also wandor is right, 3-4 ticks is 18-24 seconds that is a long time to spend running a mob back to camp, so i think your math is wrong there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
From what I can tell, incite doesn't give you the &quot;initial bonus&quot; hate you gain when you agro the mob via traditional methods (arrow, proximity, melee, spell) so you would need to arrow firsts.  I find if you incite and wait for the mob to get close (and melee you), you do as well as shooting an arrow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lokkak</div><div class="date">05-06-2004, 04:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also, I can say for sure, that an arrow, then turn around (facing camp) and slam incite until it no longer gives &quot;OOR&quot; errors, then run to camp is significantly more likely to overcome tash than pulling with an arrow, running to camp and hitting incite when the mob is in &quot;melee&quot; range.  By leaps and bounds even.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pulling with incite and then tashing (have SCS3 but not the tash hate mod) the chanter will have agro ... if I hold the tash until after the 1st round of melee the chanter doesnt pull agro.  SKs will report similar effects from the Terror line of pure hate spells.  Pure hate (like incite) builds on melee / spell casting agro, but wont stand up on its own.<br />
<br />
No parsings, no hard data or facts, but my experiences support this and what I have read in alot of posts from others (both warriors and SKs) support this aswell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Utaldain</div><div class="date">05-07-2004, 04:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Parsing has been done about hate generation.  <br />
<br />
This thread  (http://www.shadowknight.org/forums/showthread.php?threadid=18154&amp;highlight=thule+and+disarm)shows the testing done with various weapons, and given fixed amounts of Hate generating affects.  <br />
<br />
Couple notes from later in that shed light on the question here, but <br />
<br />
Initial Hate is capped.  Meaning whatever you agro the mob with, not matter what it is, will produce a maximum amount of hate.    <br />
<br />
Lesson here, pull with arrow, then incite as it closes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">05-08-2004, 04:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's a certain amount of aggro you must have over everyone else before you can move a mob to you and it varies from mob to mob.  Incite by itself is never enough to move a mob to you as long as anyone else has aggro.<br />
<br />
So let's say you incite a mob for 400 hate, someone does 1 hate (say, boggle), but he is closer to you than the mob.  The mob checks its aggro list, you have 400 hate, but the person with 1 hate is closer and 400 isn't enough to move it, so it stays instead to beat the person with 1 aggro.<br />
<br />
I'd estimate the amount of aggro you need to move a mob is around ~700 (an EB can usually move a mob).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Behemot</div><div class="date">05-10-2004, 05:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you very much for your answers, really appreciated!<br />
<br />
Thinking it over, I must admit the pull time was rather 1-2 ticks, but the pure math should still work. I pulled with incite from range, then run back to camp. I was standing in front of the enchanter. I have the Target's Target Health leader AA, so I have seen that the chanter got the aggro the moment he cast tash, and we were both at roughly equal distance (me a little closer). Also when the mob reached me, it run directly for the chanter who was standing well behind me. So I think it wasn't proximity issue, rather, what you also wrote - that the incite's aggro is modified, it was not 400, but much less. Either initial aggro is capped (however, sometimes I pulled with arrow, cast incite later, so incite wasn't initial aggro - and still, the same thing happened), or the aggro generated by incite is decreased if you use it at a distance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lokkak</div><div class="date">05-10-2004, 07:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the aggro generated by incite is decreased if you use it at a distance.<br />
<br />
I don't believe distance has anything to do with this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Read the info posted.  You will see that distance does play a part and that pure Hate effects suck at range because of that.</div></div><hr />

Pull the mob using the Bow. <br />
Once the mob is in range of the camp and heading to the chanter who has used Tash THEN use the incite.<br />
Order of agro is also a factor as agro &quot;dissipates&quot; off of mobs over time.<br />
