<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hormadrune</div><div class="date">12-31-2003, 03:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm babysitting a now 54 cleric for a friend who has semi-retired. I'd love to duo him up and get the cleric xp'd while getting some very modest aaxp for my main warrior.<br />
<br />
Warrior is 65 with 65ish aas. Has ToD and snare whip for utility weaps, as well as ornate bp, gaunts and 2 DS clickies (11 DS total) for relevant self-buffs. Magelo is up to date but this is the important stuff. Has all flags up to Sol Ro tower. I think he's about 8k with temp and ornate buff.<br />
<br />
Cleric is 54 with 3k-3500ish mana (no magelo for him handy so I'm guessing) and FT6. I have an ornate bracer mold for when he dings 55 so he'll be FT8. No flags yet.<br />
<br />
Is this a practical endeavor or am I simply wasting my time by trying to 2box them? I did PoN for a spell last night simply because I knew I could solo mobs down even if I managed to get the cleric killed. Pulled with warrior, slowed with ToD, switched in snare whip/emp sword, snared, switched in agnarr sword for snare whip. Cleric DS'd the mob, cele healed the warrior, nuked a bit, CH'd warrior at end of each fight. I'm a servicably good 2boxer but I'm no pro, so I'm sure I could be more efficient.<br />
<br />
XP for both was *painfully* slow it seemed. Is there a better place to do this or is this about as good as it gets given the level of the cleric? I like playing the cleric by himself but my main needs AAs and I'd feel guilty to neglect him completely.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?</div></div><hr />

Bugs camp there is still good pp, and you'll level cleric up too. Not sure on aaexp though, it's been a while since I've been in seb.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kamidari</div><div class="date">12-31-2003, 03:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd try punishers/enforcers in the PoJ basement.  They barely hit my warrior (which is geared worse than yours, with 90-ish AA), and they don't run so you can skip the snare portion of your routine.  Some are light blue at 65, but you can mow them down fast enough that the exp isn't terrible, and the loot doesn't suck, either.  You will sometimes get 2 on a pull though, so be ready to root with your cleric.  To keep that to a minimum, whenever there are 2 across from each other, con them both.  If one is light blue, pull the other one, and it'll come solo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slammer</div><div class="date">12-31-2003, 03:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kamidari has a good point i did the same thing with my cleric, I also found that going to KC and pulling to entrance was fun. I used heals over time and pulled 3 to 4 at a time and owned them was good exp for my cleric when she was 43 to 53..Be sure and save your AE taunt, incase you get in trouble and have to cheal with your cleric..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azunias</div><div class="date">12-31-2003, 03:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would agree with the KC camp too. Just be wary of some of the fools that fail an announce of a really BAD train that's inc.<br />
<br />
KC's a blast .... but not to keen on the rez duties 'cause of some fool.<br />
<br />
**passing note .... I do wanna give PoJ a go .... seems it would be fun**</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raivene</div><div class="date">12-31-2003, 03:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with Kamidari about mauvin hall in PoJ.  It's about the best xp you can see.  <br />
<br />
To avoid double pulls the majority of the time just pacify with the cleric.  I believe the one you have avail at 54 will work down there.<br />
<br />
If you really want to rack up the xp down there for the cleric do the following:<br />
<br />
don't group the two<br />
<br />
Pull mob...melee to 10%<br />
<br />
Root it...<br />
<br />
Atone it...<br />
<br />
Nuke it for the last little bit and get full xp on the cleric.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kamidari</div><div class="date">12-31-2003, 03:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh, good point about pacify...  I duo with a shaman, so don't have that option, and didn't think of it.  That should make it nice and easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slowmotionz</div><div class="date">01-01-2004, 07:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My advice is to PL the cleric up... Beat it down then have the cleric use ATONE or whatever higher level mem blur there might be one or two times then nuke it dead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rylaa</div><div class="date">01-01-2004, 08:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, enforcers camp is pretty good, and not bad cash either. <br />
<br />
I leveled my cleric and enchanter up there a lot. <br />
<br />
Pacify to split mobs works quite well, although I did get the occasional resist. After I got comfortable with the camp I just started pulling 2+ at a time, and I didn't bother slowing them with ToD or my enchanter even as they don't really hurt unless you got a nice train. :)<br />
<br />
I haven't run into too many camps that work as well for a warrior/cleric duo actually. The exp will definitely be slower than if you were grouped up but it's nothing to sneeze at either.</div></div><hr />
