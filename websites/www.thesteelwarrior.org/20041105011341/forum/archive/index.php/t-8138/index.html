<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">probably will boost 2h damage by 5 percent. i guess it depends how often you use 2h. if like me you use it 5 percent of the time then your average dps goes up by 5 percent of 5 percent = 1/4 percent. not worth it. if you use 2h a lot then it may be. depends on your cash position of course.</div></div><hr />

Have the great sword, parses better but not hugely noticeable so. What is nice is the 4/7 slot so have permafrost/FT2 in it (this is my pally). Sword loooks literally like a sword (dont have any comps. It looks reasonable, not sexy but not stupid either. Size is little smaller than I would have thought. It looks kind of small in my dorf pally's hands. I bought becaue of slightly better dps (pally is 2H dps only for my box) and the slots.<br />
