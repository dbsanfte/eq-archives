<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Coriakin</div><div class="date">11-20-2003, 12:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Granted, the quest is significantly too hard, but I think it will be worth it now that we can add a proc augment to it.  At least, I know I'm not giving up on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">11-20-2003, 01:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can add a proc to any weapon that already has a proc.  Take the CHoS and SoTB for example.  They're both better than the epics.  Aug them, and they're both better than aug'd epics. And infinitely easier to get.  Don't get me wrong, I'm probably going to finish my epic just for the satisfaction of finally finishing the damned thing. (and I started before there were droga weapons and GSoT's)  Sadly, I already have better weapons in my bag.  So, if you want to do it just to be doing it, go for it.  If nothing else, the blades look cool.  It's a badge of honor.  If you're doing it to get a better aggro weapon, you could probably save you and your friends/guildies a lot of grief and just buy or camp droga weapons and anger/ykesha aug them.<br />

For the weapon itself, there are better 1H and 2H (both aggro and DPS) available for far less effort in either camping or raising coin to buy in bazaar... and like Beornegar said all of em can be augmented.</div></div><hr />

If they are going to PoAir anyway, extend the vacation and get the drop.<br />

Going to those places specifically to get a warrior epic drop?  Nyaaa.<br />

I am pretty sure my guild would have contributed to a BOC fund in order to NOT have to back to PoA.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bonequest</div><div class="date">11-24-2003, 03:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think it is worth it just to say you did it, as a sense of accomplishment because it really is very hard to do.  Of course, the Vex Thal key quest is also relatively hard and the benefits from that are potentially far more than from getting the epic.<br />
<br />
Its definitely not worth it if you just want a better weapon because it really sucks compared to much easier to obtain alternatives.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Peorth12</div><div class="date">12-04-2003, 09:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I personally think it is worth it.  It looks pretty cool, and its pretty good for holding agro.  CHoS and SotB are a dime a dozen it seems, so having epics are kinda unique.<br />
<br />
Plus, if u have 50k u can pretty much just buy the entire epic.  (Well, not Chardok piece, but that piece isn't too difficult to get since so many clerics go down there to get epic and just kill the queen for fun.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sterix_VA</div><div class="date">12-05-2003, 01:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have had epic for..I dont know, year now?<br />
I have been off-handing it with SotB and it has worked pretty well. I just recently got CHoS because I got tired of red epics proc being resisted in Sol Ro and other fire resistant places.<br />
<br />
It is great damage combo. But epic is better aggro in my opinion. It is not a main hand weapon, but for off-hand it is tough to get better weapon easily.<br />
<br />
I am nowadays in raiding guild and am expecting to get BoC soonish, when that happens my raiding setup will be BoC and epic for aggro.<br />
<br />
So shame on you people who are saying epic is useless. It is still a very good weapon for aggro.<br />
Now, is it worth the effort? That is questionable, epic quest is very hard and frustrating.</div></div><hr />

Every time we went for another class and I was there I got the Warrior piece, due to nobody else wanting. As of right now all I need to get for Epic is the frozen heart and a Red Dragon Scale. I will get these and get the Epic even though I have better already. I am not getting it for the sake of having the weapon, rather for the sake of pride. Our Epic is one of the toughest to achieve, and I respect all the warriors I see who wield it.<br />

Anyway was a bit upset with the whole quest but after a month to think about we took one group and did it on a sunday afternoon.<br />

What I need is -&gt;&gt; anyone have a wingblade for sale MQ (CT), I dont really want to goto poa to get one?</div></div><hr />

**shrugs and grins**<br />
<br />
No point in arguing with them over it. It really is too bad that it has no useful purpose like, say, the cleric epic.</div></div><hr />

it's such a freakin cakewalk these days hell, it's a good buisness proposition to go farm as many wingblades as ya can.</div></div><hr />

I took my guild up there for the first time last week to get an epic piece for a ranger in my guild.  I was expecting a whoopass straight out of all the horror posts you read on some of the sites, but frankly, it was trivial.  If you don't know, the ranger epic piece drops on the Isle directly before the Spirocs, and with 15 people we were able to clear up to that point easily.  In fact, I'm convinced one group of 60+ could do that much with a little more time.  Also on the bright side the keys no longer disappear after you log so its possible to work an isle at a time when you get the chance.<br />
<br />
Dig up the info so you know what to expect and it should be a breeze, and take a few more than one group for the spirocs, preferably a ranger or gnome to eat a few DTs, thats what they were created for :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">01-05-2004, 01:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got my epic when it was a good weapon for warriors, this was back when Velious had just came out and only 1 guild on our server was just starting NToV. I used it all the way until Luclin when better weapons were available without having to kill uber mobs. I don't use them anymore except to show off when I'm not fighting anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azrael</div><div class="date">01-05-2004, 02:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did my epic quest simply for the pleasure of completing after starting it back when it first went live and because the epic has got to be the best looking weapon in the game.  It may not be the best weapon out there but they look great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spots da Cat</div><div class="date">01-08-2004, 01:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got mine last night as sort of a pride/determination thing.  I took over a year off and much better weapons are available for a heck of a lot less trouble.<br />
<br />
Found green scales in the bazaar for 10k, a friend had the maestro hand, a guild cleric needed king, so it kinda fell into place for the last 3 pieces.<br />
<br />
My question, is the rumors about turning them into 14/20 vice 14/24 anywhere near true?  Im just returning after a year as mentioned, and knowing SOE's history I dont see it happening.<br />
<br />
But looking at it another way, swapping them to 14/20 would make them marginally acceptable compared to other weapons, very nice for folks who arent that far into areas where better drop, and it would generate a lot of interest in Chardok, Hate, Fear, Air, red and green scales in zones that arent utilized as other zones.  <br />

No were near true.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ThornyEQ</div><div class="date">01-08-2004, 02:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That is the one thing that would make the epics worth getting, IMHO, improving the ratio to 14/20 or so.<br />
<br />
Alternately, they could leave the epics as they are and add a second layer to it: do some additional quest, maybe kill some PoTactics baddies or some other ubah-warrior mobs, and turn their heads in with the epics for 14/20 versions of the blades; that sort of thing...not yet another PoAaaagggh!! camp.<br />
<br />
The sad truth is that for what they do, the warrior epics are some of the worst epics in EQ, and until that is addressed (and no, I have no particular hope that it will ever be addressed), they are simply a fashion statement. :(</div></div><hr />

b: Impressing the noobs. I never bothered to unequip after doing a (see above) and was just hanging around. Got a LOT of oohs and aahs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tsaotsao</div><div class="date">01-12-2004, 06:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the warrior epic is still a good weapon for progression. The blue epic comes in very handy for stats, and I find I am using the red epic a good bit for a secondary agro weapon. <br />
<br />
Could it be better? Absolutely. <br />
<br />
But it dam fun to have. <br />
<br />
And though I rarely have effects turned on, when I do, it just looks so dam good!!! Even on a dwarf, where it looks like a set of glowing steak knives.<br />
<br />
Will I always use my epics? No, probably not... but for now, they are fun to have and play with.  It's always good to have an assortment of weapons to mix and match to meet your situation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goradain</div><div class="date">01-22-2004, 12:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did my Epic about a year ago.  I still use my 2H Epic quite a bit when tanking.  It holds aggro damn well and is even better now that you can do Furious-&gt;Defensive on unslowables.  I have a GSoT and it doesn't even come close to holding aggro as well as JBoW.  Until I get Xanas hammer (any day now...) I will probably continue to use it as my primary tanking weapon.  I will likely still use it to cut my riposte damage down on the hard hitters, though.  The 1Hers are totally not worth it, though.  They are pretty worthless.  I don't even carry them anymore.<br />
<br />
I'm really happy that I did my Epic and nowdays it's not even that hard to do anymore.</div></div><hr />
