<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So, I get up this morning about 3am, and after some shenaningans and reading and whatnot, I decide to head to FG to do the caller cycle for a lil AAXP.<br />
<br />
For those not familiar with the drops, one of the items is a &quot;Pod of Blue Fungus&quot; which is consumable, 1 charge of Invigorate, the 100hp heal. <br />
<br />
As those who have all of their bag slots full know, to use a consumable or clicky item that's not equipped, you have to pick up the item, click on a bag to swap positions with the item, click the item, and then put your bag back down.<br />
<br />
Well, apparantly, I've found a serious bug.  I was looting the pile of corpses, and found a Pod, I stood up, with my inventory screen closed, clicked on my Treasure Hunter's Satchel that is hotkeyed in my UI, dropped the pod and clicked and .......<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
My dragon bag was consumed instead of the pod.<br />
<br />
I immediately look down and take some steps back.  It's nowhere on the ground.  I didn't destroy it, I have confirm destroy on, and my destroy button wasn't even on the screen anyway.  I didn't drop it...there is actually no way I could have dropped it, because my Willsapper was in that bag, thereby making the bag no drop.  It is physically impossible to drop a bag with a no drop item in it, and I had multiple no drop items in the bag.<br />
<br />
I immediately petition, and log out my shaman to head into chat.  I ask if there's a GM who can be bothered to stop watching pr0n and get his ass on CT.  I'm told I have to be patient, but they'll get to me today.  Riiight.<br />
<br />
So this was at 05:29:20AM CST.  Right now, it's coming up on 11:30.  Anyone wanna wager when/if I'll finally see a fucking GM?  I'm fairly sure I'll get my bag back, that doesn't concern me so much.  What concerns me is that I have to sit around all day and can't play the game because all of my utility gear is gone, and there's no point in even trying.  Still think SoE is trying to make your online experience better?  Well, we'll see won't we.  <br />
<br />
By the way, here's the list of what was in that bag, for the curious.<br />
<br />
Silken Whip of Ensnaring<br />
Sword of the Bloodsworn<br />
Windblade<br />
Shrunken Goblin Skull Earring<br />
Blazing Vambraces<br />
Velium Coldain Insignia Ring<br />
Incarnadine Breastplate<br />
Willsapper<br />
Earthshaker.<br />
<br />
It's basically impossible for me to do anything until I get that bag back.  We'll see how long it takes someone to actually do something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dinklehimer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">And here i thought i was weird for carrying around so much stuff. Looks like im not so weird after all lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Alisdahre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">And here i thought i was weird for carrying around so much stuff. Looks like im not so weird after all lol<br />
<br />
Not wierd at all :)  Utility utility utility.  Can't beat it.  Especially for a class that has none innately.<br />
<br />
I've got 3 bags full of utility on me at all times for everything under the sun, right clickies, potions, useful procing weapons... and wouldn't have it any other way.<br />
<br />
Out of any bag that could go poof, that's definatly the worst one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yikes.<br />
I'm going to empty out a sewing kit or some such and drink some water to see what happens. I'd not remain calm if my weapons bag went away.<br />
this a hotkey thing, or also with inventory open, I wonder.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I had this issue a few months back where every time I'd log in my main EQ would crash.  We have six EQ capable PC's in our house, so it wasn't a PC or install issue.  It was an issue with my char, and I needed a GM to log in my main and move him from the zone he was in.  I went through the same crap, I petitioned, logged to an alt and played my alt for over four hours.  I then gave up and logged and came back figuring maybe I'd have better luck later.  Three hours pass and still no luck.  I have my wife login her char and petition for me.  I am doing a /who all gm the whole time and nothing.  Finally I log out to chat and start asking what the hell is going on, and why do I have to wait so many hours.  A GM in chat says that someone will be there soon.  So I log back to the server and within 15 minutes I do a /who all GM and there are no shit, 5 GM's online.  WTF?  So you have to log to chat and bitch to hell to get GM's to show up?  Then a GM responds to my wife's petition and I find that my petition is gone from the queue.  Pretty freaking sad....  I am just so so grateful I haven't had any issues since then that have required me to contact a GM, it is so incredibly painful.  My advice is to have other hobbies, because if EQ is your only hobby and it goes down then you are really in a world of hurt.<br />
<br />
I also keep tons of gear for utility...  still need to get myself an incardine bp or cobalt greaves tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Oh, I have plenty of hobbies...but I've already paid for them.  I'm paying for EQ right now, and I think a 24 hour response time on an in game issue is bullshit.<br />
<br />
Up to 7...will I get to 24?  We'll see.<br />
<br />
Also, I just logged in to chat to start rattling some cages, and it's quite obvious that I could talk circles around this dude all day and it's not gonna get my Satchel back any faster, so why bother.  He's just a dude who's job happens to be sitting in EQ chat all day, not really doing much of anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Pumilio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I made a ticket indicating I wanted my bracer of rage turned into a royal attendant, so I could sell back for points.<br />
<br />
Reply was something along the lines of &quot;make sure you check your skill before you buy a item, make sure confirmation is up, make sure it's the item you want blah blah blah.&quot;<br />
<br />
Right, like I knew they were going to sell armour for points later or that the rage stuff wasn't a effort to help players get armour they need by freeing them from having to do a ldon everyone hates (south ro anyone) just to get a leather bp, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well, before 1pm Pacific Time, the issue was resolved,  Guess that's not too bad since the issue basically happened in the middle of the nite.<br />
<br />
I guess I'd expect at least ONE guy on around the clock on a game like this, but I'm not too terribly disappointed.  It's definitely better than when I was trying to get my guild tagged...fuckin took 2 weeks to get a GM online with me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Better than lots of times. Glad it got taken care of so relatively quickly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Callon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ahh.... utility bags.  I had my big bag o' weapons for a long time, but I've branched out.  <br />
<br />
I still have...<br />
<br />
1. silken whip of ensnaring (never use it)<br />
2. greatstaff of the four winds (seldom used, but for when I'm not supposed to get aggro)<br />
3. goblin skull earring (little atk buff insta click)<br />
4. velium coldain insignia ring (8 pt DS insta click)<br />
5. dark phylactery (+5 regen, whoopee, but it's inventory insta clickie)<br />
6. gnomish minimizing device<br />
7. cobalt vams (for that hardly ever used now crappy ass lesser shielding buff... why oh why haven't I bid on an ornate bp for a decent self buff when no shm/bst around? heh)<br />
8. cobalt boots (+25 str when no buffer around, woo woo! lol)<br />
9. EB neck item<br />
10. stock of invis potions (no one sells vanishing devices these days!)<br />
<br />
hmm... what else do i need in my packs?  I carry way too damn much mysterious quest crap, especially with oow out.  i r packrat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Ok, here is my list of utility stuff.<br />
<br />
Anklesmasher - use it quite often actually as my usual group is me, shm, clr, ench and we hit places where we need snare.  Ever hit the PoJ basement bugs, those things run like you wouldn't believe.<br />
<br />
Truncheon of Doom - slow, use it when my wife isn't boxing her ench/shm and I box the cleric.<br />
<br />
Cobalt bracer - shaman is too lazy to shrink usually, but now that she got the group buff she's better about it.<br />
<br />
Blazing vambraces - 9 pt damage shield all the time isn't too shabby.<br />
<br />
Fishbone earring - EB, rarely used.<br />
<br />
GSot4W - DPS 2H.<br />
<br />
GSOT - 2H aggro, I usually use SoD and CHoS, I prefer dual-wield.<br />
<br />
Sotb - for stunning higher level mobs.<br />
<br />
Monstrous Flamberge of Alacrity - for 2HS, but mostly for looks.  :)<br />
<br />
Other stuff not in bag -<br />
<br />
Kizraks' gauntlets - Haste<br />
<br />
Shroud of Fallen Defender - AC buff<br />
<br />
Kizrak's BP - shielding HP/AC buff<br />
<br />
Stuff I still want for utility - <br />
<br />
Cobalt Greaves/Incarndine BP - but my wifes enchanter is a tinkering so we may do a PoI run soon so she can get parts for a vanishing device so I have something for invis, but I'm rarely alone anyways<br />
<br />
Shrunken goblin skull earring - just need to get one I suppose for the atk buff<br />
<br />
edit: left out the ToD   :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Calinthalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">A few months ago, a guildie of mine logged into his toon, and the name floating above his head was in bright green.  And yes, when you /who'd his name, you got a GM tag affixed......but he didn't show up when you went /who all GM.  He tried to do neat GM stuff....but couldn't figure out the proper commands, or they wouldn't work.  After a couple of days, the green went away, and he was booted from our guild in the process.  Not sure why, so I tried to throw him a guild tag, and I got the message &quot;You have to remove this person from the guild before you can re-invite them.&quot;  So, it wouldn't let me remove him (as that he wasn't in the guild) and it wouldn't let me tag him either.<br />
<br />
He immediatly petitioned.  Every raid I would try to toss him another guild tag, and I would get the same message.  This went on for about a week.  Finnally, when we were setting up for a RZtW kill, I lost my cool with it.  I had every member of the guild that was online to immediatly petition.  We had a GM in about 10 minutes.  He complained about all the petitions, but of course, everyone basically said, &quot;Dude, it's been a week already, we've been patient enough already.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>czai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I got used to EQ's slow ass GMs until I played DAoC... where getting a CSR took 5 minutes to an hour, tops, and you could track your appeal through its queue and see its progress.<br />
<br />
In EQ... you just wait, and hope.  It's a pretty ass system.  They have the technology to program it to a more user-friendly system, but I doubt they ever will.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I had a bugged mission in City of Heroes about 2 weeks ago. It was the first time I actually had need of GM/Customer Service help.<br />
<br />
It was like 2 a.m.<br />
<br />
FIVE MINUTES. That's all it took. FIVE MINUTES and the GM had come into my mission. Said hi. Read my petition. Looked right at the spot where I had the bug, and boom, fixed the problem.<br />
<br />
I was used to Everquest. So needless to say, I didn't quite know how to respond. I eventually blurted out quite a long string of thank-yous.</div></div><hr />
