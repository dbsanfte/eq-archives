<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bulbog</div><div class="date">01-26-2004, 07:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, it's just cheap really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ODB</div><div class="date">01-26-2004, 09:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">40AP For the augment, I think most ppl grab it after their first adventure just to say oww wow I have 50dd fire augment. At least, that's what I did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ahz</div><div class="date">01-26-2004, 11:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got it so I could see how well augments worked.  By the time I replaced it with Anger3, I got my value from it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telen</div><div class="date">01-26-2004, 02:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">At level 48 I was only getting 10 points per adventure and doing 1-2 adventures a week, so I felt like it was worth the 40 points to get the aug now because I knew I'd get a lot of use out of it.  Once I am higher level and getting more AP per adventure I'll start looking at ykesha/anger procs.  Heated blade is not great aggro, but is a nice dps increase and is a bit of additional aggro.<br />
<br />
Edit:  Also the spell effects are kind of cool, fire dripping down.  Goes nicely with the lightning effect on the CHoS.  Fire and lightning.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Derrict</div><div class="date">01-26-2004, 05:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good bang for the buck augment.  Should be worth about 1.5-2 dps on a primary weapon with 200+ dex.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TaiilChayser</div><div class="date">01-26-2004, 08:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I bought it after one adventure just to see how it worked. I don't do many adventures so I have kept it to this point. I regularly parse it at ~2dps with 285dex. 50dd proc for 40 points is really hard to pass up, even if it is only used temporarily.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mokor Leadheaad</div><div class="date">01-27-2004, 04:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">aye and compared to the other 50 point dps aug it's a flat out steal. it and the 20pointer from guk are very nice for lower lvl wars who can't amass points fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ulic</div><div class="date">01-27-2004, 04:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Interesting thoughts...I've been sitting on my points for anger 3 but I need about 600 more points in EF to unlock them. Maybe I'll pick up one of these cheapies to tide over the boredom ( warriors need their toys ).</div></div><hr />
