<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>felgarmcewan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok I have a Scepter of Destruction right now.  its a <br />
<br />
MAGIC ITEM<br />
Slot: PRIMARY SECONDARY<br />
Skill: 1H Blunt Atk Delay: 18<br />
DMG: 12 Dmg Bonus: 13<br />
STR: +10 DEX: +10 STA: +10 HP: +50 MANA: +50<br />
Effect: Anarchy (Combat)<br />
WT: 0.2 Size: SMALL<br />
Class: ALL except NEC WIZ MAG ENC BER<br />
Race: ALL<br />
Slot 1, Type 4<br />
<br />
Ok the Anarchy is a 288 damage proc.  <br />
<br />
<br />
What raw damage/delay would offset the damage potential of a 12/18 with a 288 damage proc?<br />
<br />
Would a 15/19 add more DPS?  of not, how far do I need to go to get a better weapon?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">a 15 19 without a proc at all is definatly worse than a SoD if you want to tank. The slash dps will be higher by good amount though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The proc on the SoD mainhand alone adds almost 10 DPS to your combo, so you'd have to be looking at a pretty stellar ratio  for it to outdamage it.  15/20 won't for sure.  I dunno what 15/19 you have in mind, but I'd be guessing that wouldn't either.<br />
<br />
SoD is a good weapon, not much reason to upgrade it if you don't know what the upgrades to it are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Most two handers will outdamage it handily.  GSo4W definately will, windblade might</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bonequest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think GBoS will out dps it and is easy to get if you can get 3 groups (less if better equiped) to go get you one in BoT.  The 14/18 ratio is a lot better and the 179 dd + stun is  only going to be 3.6 dps less assuming 2 procs a minute.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Most two handers will outdamage it handily. GSo4W definately will, windblade might <br />
<br />
Windblade won't outdamage SoD/Copper Hammer, at least with the AA's I have.  PB may change it, tho I doubt it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>felgarmcewan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Actually, looking at elemental/Time upgrades.<br />
<br />
I have been serving in Iraq since April 2003.  I will  be comming home soon, well about May 2004.  Anyway, my guild went from just getting to the door of the elemental planes to being a Tier 5 POTime guild.  When I get back, I have a bit of catching up to do :)<br />
<br />
Anyway, I am using in my mainhand a Blade of Carnage, in my offhand I use my Scepter of Destruction.  <br />
<br />
I am just wondering what the magic damage/delay would be that would compensate for the loss of the proc.  There are a lot of weapons that will be available to me once I get back seeing as most of the guild has upgraded thier weapons already.  I just dont want to go in for something that will be only a marginal upgrade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Daramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You're talking about going from the gold standard in Velious to Time? You've got *lots* of catching up to do, more than you seem to realize. Honestly if I was a warrior wielding your weapons and suddenly found myself in Time, weapons would be the least of my worries. You probably don't break 8K HP buffed, and most of your guildmates are hitting 8 and maybe 9K *unbuffed*.<br />
<br />
At any rate, the weapons most people consider gold standard in Time are Darkblade of the Warlord and Edge of Eternity.<br />
<br />
[edit: Ok, looked at your Magelo, and as I suspected you're doing ok for bazaar gear, but *any* drop in Time is going to be an upgrade for you. Your weapons are fine for where you are HP-wise, you could do easy EP xp camps even. Start upgrading your AC/HP so you can handle the increased agro that better weapons will give you.]<br />
<br />
p.s. if you're just looking to do DPS, SoD/BoC are the wrong combo. You will want a 2h most likely, preferrably one without an agro proc, since agro will result in your being splatted. Not sure what you would be looking for in Time, but SEWS is a good choice from the EP's, and later you can augment it for a 2h agro weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>felgarmcewan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">True, I buff up to 8.9K and with 210 AA.  I know I am behind, but you tend to get a bit of time to sit around and plan out wishlists in the desert :P<br />
<br />
My merit isnt going to approach those weapons for a while once I get back, so im figuring something in the meantime.  I am guessing I will be getting scraps for a while once I return, but hell those scraps are substatial upgrades to me at this point.  <br />
<br />
Just dont know what kind of damage/delay to shoot for as a solid upgrade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Chance are that you won't be doing much raid tanking anyway, so I wouldn't be in a huge hurry to get new weapons. Take anything you can get your hands on, everything is going to be a good upgrade. Right off the bat you should get a ring, earring, neck from tier 1 since those are likely rotting. If you really want to duel weild, you might consider a combination of Cudgel of Wrecking (Tier 2), Ethereal Destroyer (Tier 3), or Edge of Eternity (Saryrn). If you prefer 2hers then go for either a Timeless Coral Greatsword (Tier 3) or Vanazir, Dreamer's Despair (Terris Thule). VDD is a fine weapon with good agro that can be used for DPS or tanking, you might hold out for one.<br />
<br />
Other than that, Tier 1-4 should be a gold mine for you. Most of the drops are fairly common so they start rotting after only a few months in Time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">^^ what wandor said.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>felgarmcewan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Thank you for the response.<br />
<br />
Being deployed for a year has a way of putting you a bit behind the power curve :)  <br />
<br />
Its very nice to see how well my guild has been owning Plane of Time.  They killed RZ in a very short time after gaining access. <br />
<br />
Sounds like getting a good 2hander is going to be the best way to go, then try and pick up an EOE to replace my SOD for when I am tanking.  BOC/EOE seems to be the combo I will aim for to use tanking for XP groups or EP mobs.  Dont see much reason to replace the BOC unless its for a DBoTW.  <br />
<br />
But from what I am hearing, people are tanking just fine with VDD or Timeless Coral Greatsword.    In which case it might just be best to bag the 2 1 handers.  dunno, for now its speculation until I leave Iraq.  But it helps to pass the time :)</div></div><hr />
