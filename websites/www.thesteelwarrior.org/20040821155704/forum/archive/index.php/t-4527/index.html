<br />
Well,<br />
<br />
between the so far announced melee changes... <br />
New skills and Abilities..<br />
Unhooking Disciplines..<br />
Increased DPS..<br />
Increased Utility..<br />
<br />
and then we see them...<br />
<br />
Adding Taunt message on Test... <br />
Adding an apparent 5% increase in warrior pure mitigation... <br />
<br />
It sure looks like a lot of things we have been asking for are getting into the game.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
now if they would just nerf nights, &quot; there would be much rejoicing! yaaaahhh!&quot;  JK!<br />
<br />
Fix itemization some.. and I will be very happy...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Darkoan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Months ago we would have been happy with any of these things being given us.  Let's not get greedy, ok?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sorguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">months ago we hadn't waited months.......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>victatious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">imo for warriors as least they wil make this &quot;new&quot; consecpt to freaking complicated and it will not work right.... all we need really need for now is SNAP AGRO vis a vie ...... kick slam stun SHOULD BE unresistable with 500 hate added to it and the way it can be attained is thru new AA also make it a 3 sec reuse time plan as that give us snap agro and we will rule again ..... isnt that hard to program and it can be implemented in next patch with out all this new hype (IMO is BS)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Months ago we were in the same situation as today.<br />
If you think we deserve more power, for having waited so long... then you don't know what Class Balance is.<br />
<br />
And Victatious... don't take balancing so lighty.<br />
If you think giving Warrior more power, is all that is needed.. then you seriously need to think again.<br />
The GREAT thing about this change, is it brings us to a caster's level in all departements.. not just &quot;power&quot;...<br />
Having endurance on items will indirectly fix itemization,<br />
having quests for skills will fix the inequality in overall content,<br />
giving warriors the possibility to do more things can fix inequality between classes,<br />
and giving us this sort of system allows to fix, upgrade, tweek things, in the futur...<br />
<br />
Now if they just &quot;fixed&quot; Taunt, or gave us a button with 500hate, we could mash for aggro...<br />
ya, we'de be more powerfull, yay.... and would cause certain unbalances,<br />
but the rest would still be crap and boring.<br />
And within the next expansion, when knights get a ton of new spells, and aas linked to their mana and spell casting..<br />
what do we get?<br />
more hp and an aa or two that allows god knows what silly things..<br />
<br />
I never thought SOE would have more intelligence in their melee changes, then the warriors themselves...<br />
if you really think that &quot;fixing&quot; taunt, or giving us one single new skill to mash for aggro, is better then SOE's fix..<br />
then please.. promise me never ever to go work in the MMORPG market.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>ODB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Some warriors DO HAVE SNAP AGGRO. Every time a warrior here mentions how we should have snap aggro, or that it is one of or complaints that we do not have, and feel they are speaking for the warrior community when saying we want it, receieve 2k hate from me whenever they post it. Gratz, you have aggro'd me on inc~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>landrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Snap Aggro, and Aggro Lock... should never be considered for warriors when balancing classes. <br />
<br />
If you cant see that these are out of balance no matter what tank has them, then you arent being honest about the game. What these fixxes do is help warriors immensely in areas now, and give tools to upgrade melee in the future. That is a HUGE bonus. <br />
<br />
Giving us aggro-lock etc would not 'FIX' anything or fix balance, it would BREAK the system more. I think SoE knows they need to fix this, but are very hesitant to change anything before they at least correct warriors and pure melee in general first. After the new melee system is in efect I see them addressing aggro  lock in a more pro-active fashion. <br />
<br />
The taunt message is a huge step in the right direction. Does it change taunt? NO, but it now gives us something to work with. At a fan-faire a monk said they shouldnt fail FD 10 times in a row, and the Devs said send us info we will address it... Tradeskillers said they shouldnt fail so much that is trivial, they said send us info we will look at it.. Tradeskills have been fixxed. FD I dont hear as many complaints as I used to, so I would assume it has been adjusted.. Well now when I send a Log of 23 failed taunts in a row.. they have something to look at... We now have a way to PROVE what we all have believed for a long time. Before there was no way at all to be 100% sure that taunt was working, now we get a message.. thats a great step forward in my opinion...<br />
<br />
Itemization is the only place that I dont see addressed to some extent regarding our problems, and its something that we need to find out why it isnt addressed...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Pumilio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">aggro lock is never what a warrior is/was  they are the supreme tanks,  I could care less if you have troubles grouping cause it says war next to /who all you<br />
<br />
Wars should be the best tank, and should be best in weapons, not DPS but definatly in a battlefield postionn they need abilities that define them as a warlord.  Aggro lock ain't it.  <br />
<br />
Leadersrhip shielding attack styles and most importantly the ability to take dmg better and more of then any other class in the game.  that's what defines us.<br />
<br />
..i..  if you don't get it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Vikos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">We dont need aggro lock. But we do need means of reliable aggro gain. A skill that allows us to proc hate  on demand(costing endurance or having a refresh time of 15 seconds) could solve many our deficiencies in exp groups.<br />
<br />
There is nothing more frustrating than having a caster in the group tank the mob for a while because I was unable to proc and taunt failed twice(thats 12 seconds).   Beastlords, Necros, Wizards and Druids being the most problematic. <br />
<br />
And sometimes when you do get a succesful taunt and no procs, the mob turns back to the caster because your melee dps alone is not enough to get a good lead in hate.<br />
<br />
I have a BoC augmented with anger and Blade of Storms(stun proc) in offhand. Sometimes I get a lot of procs 3-4 right after the other. But sometimes I can go dry of procs during a whole fight.(talking exp group wise)<br />
<br />
Casters can still take aggro of the knights if they are sloppy. But the Paladin can aquire it back by casting 2 spells before their taunt button refreshes.  I am not asking for something on that level, but at least something that can assist me when my procs wont go off and taunt fails. Yes there is AE taunt, but I can only pull that card once every 10 minutes 30 seconds(Thats around 10-15 mobs later)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I logged on for the first time in a month or so yesterday. Did a LDoN easy adventure, no 'major' problems with aggro, lost it a few times as is to be expected but only one incident where taunt failed obviously (four failed taunts while a mob beat on the chanter) and in anycase the group dealt with it, nobody died due to aggro concerns (nobody even came close, chanter was joking about her tanking skills) and we finished with plenty of time to spare on a collect 25. All in all not a bad adventure, i felt pretty happy with my performance and nobody was bitchy about the occassional blip. <br />
<br />
I had to log afterwards, so I'm sitting down and camping and the very last sentance i see before the screen goes blank is the wizard (who to my knowledge NEVER got hit by lost aggro) saying, about getting a replacement<br />
<br />
'as long as it's not another warrior, lol' <br />
<br />
Given the generalisation of that comment I don't believe my personal ability as a warrior was behind that remark. <br />
<br />
It's not just dumb people who notice the differences, the clever ones adapt but they don't LIKE adapting. Either they need to have the situation presented to them such that they know there is no choice but to control their aggro or the warrior has to be seen to be giving similar levels of 'service',  else all the bells and whistles won't mean a damn thing as far as they're concerned. I personally HATE aggro-lock as a concept but that doesn't change the truth of that matter. <br />
<br />
Lets hope this does get addressed or all we get is some consolation utility (and yes that's all very nice I'm sure, although i do wonder if we're going to be providing anything significant to the group over the other pure melee's) as we act as DPS classes - unless we raid (you don't want to get me started on the half arsed arguement that raid mob tanking means I should be crap in exp. tanking. Especially given I don't raid much and haven't MT'd a raid mob in around 6 months). <br />
<br />
You want to call me 'Greedy' for first and foremost wanting to be viable as an exp. tank? I fart in your general direction ~<br />
<br />
P.s. My weaponry is a BoC and Vallon scimitar, not the best anymore but far from the worst aggro set up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Blah, i had promised myself i wouldn't get caught up in this again until after the chat at the least, F**k you all :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">&quot;You want to call me 'Greedy' for first and foremost wanting to be viable as an exp. tank?&quot;<br />
<br />
I've been called greedy, and self-centered for fueling a crusade to have endurance regeneration &quot;abilities&quot; be only available to melee classes.<br />
<br />
Seems shamans and enchanters and clerics feel that melee enhancements ought to include them.<br />
<br />
So not surprising you're taking heat for wanting the melee changes to actually address the PROBLEMS of your own particular melee class.<br />
<br />
People just can't accept that there are some problems, ya know?<br />
<br />
It's like every time I read a post by a caster or a hybrid, it starts off with<br />
<br />
&quot;I think warriors need help&quot;<br />
<br />
and then here comes the word ...<br />
<br />
&quot;BUT&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think monks need help&quot;<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
&quot;BUT&quot;<br />
<br />
And then they proceed to deconstruct any and every good idea about melee help.<br />
<br />
/sigh<br />
<br />
Cynicism ... taking over ... help!</div></div><hr />
