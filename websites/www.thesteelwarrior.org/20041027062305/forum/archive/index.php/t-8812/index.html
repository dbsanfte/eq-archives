<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I can't seem to find any good info on the Loremaster Piza' that drops the Anklesmasher in Chardok.  Is he behind a locked door?  What type of force does it take to drop him?  My regular group is four players, 62-63 war/clr/enc/shm, decently geared.  Can we take him?  Do we need a lockpicker?  Should I just pay 50-60k which is the typical asking price for one, if it's even for sale?<br />
<br />
Should I just stick with my silken whip of ensnaring?  It seems to work fine, but it is slow and the -AC sucks.  I just hate to mainhand that slow puppy to get a proc and the snare doesn't last near as long as anklesmasher.  People also say anklesmasher procs a lot, does it have an increased proc rate, or is that a myth?<br />
<br />
Thanks for info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Khabok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">He is found in the Library area, past the locked door so you need a rogue to get to him. I am pretty sure mobs in there see through invis so you will need to clear to him, hard to say what group can do it. Also he has a PH so isnt always up, and he doesnt always drop the Anklesmasher when he is up.<br />
<br />
    Anklesmasher has the same proc rate as all weapons. But in a low DPS group, and with weapon affinity AA's it will usually proc during a fight. I use mine a lot when Duoing in places like Tactics or Droga. Start fight with the aggro weapons till the shammy can  malos and slow, then swap anklesmasher in to main hand till I see it proc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Khazzuz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">He's on the bottom level of the library, spawns right next to the second locked door in the royals area.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Pig</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Duo'd the room easy with a 65cleric/65 warr. (pacify pull).  Ya you need a rogue<br />
to open the door  =(<br />
<br />
Tried to have the mobs open it for me, but they just magically warped thru it<br />
when i pushed them up against it.  Was gonna try something absolutey insane<br />
like pushing the mob thru it, have it summon my warr, then try to get my cleric<br />
enuff aggro so he gets summoned thru too (I was frustrated) but thankfully<br />
a rogue and his 2-box wandered by and opened the door.  I went thru, named<br />
up in the library visably holding Anklesmasher in his hand, better to be lucky<br />
then good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Saeborne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The Loremaster stands right next to that &quot;Hole-in-the-floor&quot; Trap, that lands on the king's head.  So obviously, it would be recommended to pull the mob away from his spawn point.  As a side note, it is possible to aggro the king and his lacky's by fighting too close to the hole trap.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hmmm....ouch?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Saeborne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">ouch indeed...  It hurt bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Khabok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hehe, Aggroing both the King and Queen and all of the guards with them and in back room and hall, into the library makes for a nice train, and usually a fast wipe, or at least back when we were low 60's and less it did for a 5 group raid.<br />
<br />
   And in case you dont know, the top of the stairs, just inside the first locked door, is still a safe spot and a good place to drag corpses for rezzing. Even though what used to be known as the Safe Room there is now full of mobs on the sides, they are far enough out to not aggro if you stay on top couple steps.</div></div><hr />
