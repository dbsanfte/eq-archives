<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Qest</div><div class="date">03-18-2004, 06:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The one highest-tier thing I've soloed is one of the black worms in Valor.  Lead with Truncheon of Doom and then swap to GSo4W for DPS.<br />
<br />
When I feel like soloing, I can solo my way all around the new Droga.  I lead with Truncheon of Doom and then follow with Anklesmasher (usually with Prismatic in off-hand) and then with GSo4W.<br />
<br />
Weapon Affinity makes it a lot better since I get the important procs in quicker and can thus switch to DPS sooner.  The 10th Coldain ring is also very useful.</div></div><hr />

<br />
dispell pots , 300+ Cr , and decent equipment <br />
<br />
the 300hp 10charge heal pots help too , and a crazy ds.. dont slow ,</div></div><hr />

Ran into some Giant in EW just off of GD also that was probably the toughest without having slow. Without AA's there would of been no way I could of survived. Light blu and could only get him 5-10% less health than me for the duration of the fight even with defensive and I think using precision.</div></div><hr />

<br />
hardest was the named sarnak in Chardok that drops the mage dagger, i keep thinking Pizz'Tak but i'm sure that's not him. that was with 6 other sarnaks+dogs beating on me.</div></div><hr />

Couldn't slow them with ToD,so i switched Tormax Axe, Hit Furious, after that hit agressive, then mightystrike.. Was only level 64 at the time though. I think i got down to 5ish% before he died.

Mobs hit weak, you normally only get one or two at a time.  I can usually kill about 6 mobs before needing to use Healing Will and bandaging for about 2 minutes and then go again until I need to do it again.  The best thing is the level 50ish clerics at zone in who will normally throw me a CH when they see me bandaging.<br />
<br />
Good use of disciplines goes a long way here.<br />
<br />
As far as an individual mob:  I soloed a trash mob in Plane of Fire by myself and had 32 hps left when the mob died.  It wasn't soloing, it was stupidity!</div></div><hr />

Kinda a toss up.<br />
<br />
Dont have much specialized soloing gear, I just throw AA's at the mobs</div></div><hr />

You would be amazed at the damage you can do with furious + plankton to an old world quad mob.  Plus if you wait until you hit zerk you add about 20% onto that.</div></div><hr />

Cazel in oasis. It was very close--I had like 20 hp left and I had all raid buffs including haste when I started.<br />
<br />
Err Cazel's like, umm, a PUSSYCAT! Found him up on the way to an LDoN the other day and smacked him about. Took 2 mins tops to solo him and I was still around 75% health. His regen is nothing special these days.<br />
<br />
I was going to try to solo Gorenaire - and felt confident I would win - until I realised they had nerfed the 300pt heal potions I was planning on using. <br />
<br />
An amusing solo... a Qua in VT. Was a massive pull of 12 or 15 mobs and I quietly pulled it off to one side and beat it down without any assistance.</div></div><hr />
