Does this still generate the same amount of aggro as if it were not resisted?  I seem to get it quite a bit more if I am tanking in PoS, or other 2 tier planes, and I need to know if I should be swapping out my 1hs for GSoT on certain mobs to keep aggro better.</div></div><hr />

Yes.<br />
<br />
Does this still generate the same amount of aggro as if it were not resisted?  <br />
<br />
If not the exact same amount, close enough it does not matter.</div></div><hr />

<br />
mainly summoned/undead dd procs.<br />
<br />
i.e. such and such spell only effects summoned creatures.</div></div><hr />

Did some research here on the boards and switched it out for SoBS.  Granted aggro is held either way, just like that I have a better chance of getting a stun in before the mob CH's or gates on me</div></div><hr />

Wouldnt that be nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">03-03-2004, 11:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">indeed, that would. so if kick/slam/bash is only good for a chance to interrupt at best and some minor dps... what a waste of a button.<br />
<br />
still, gotta wonder how the code tells the difference between an NPC receiving a melee stun versus magic/spell based stun (either has the same result on me as PC, I quit swinging).</div></div><hr />

I don't remember the last time I fought something I could interrupt with kick in an exp group.  In Beta GoD there was an AA skill to raise the mob level cap that our kick could interrupt, but they took it out.  That sucks.  It would have been more useful than the crappy kick damage upgrade they left in.<br />
<br />
Against a really hard hitting mob, it does so little that I'm not sure kick is even worth the risk of a riposte.  :p</div></div><hr />

I assume you are talking about raid level mobs? Cause in BoT I am able to interupt casters all the time.</div></div><hr />

fearsome earthcrafters in PoE can be interrupted with a kick</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">03-04-2004, 04:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can interrupt up to 65 with a kick, but it seems to vary from mob to mob.  Some mobs just won't get interrupted by kick at all.<br />
<br />
Also, if Enraging Blow can be resisted, then a resisted Enraging Blow wouldn't give as much aggro.  This only happens with Anger (-400 MR) on very rare occasions (Bristlebane, Emperor Ssraeshza, etc).</div></div><hr />

<br />
They sure do. Why do you think a Paladin's best friends are Cease and Desist. They cost almost no mana, never stun, but it's the bread and butter of aggro control.  I'm not saying that they don't use the other stuns available, but they don't have to if the intent is purely to gain aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">03-04-2004, 05:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As far as I can tell, slam/bash works pretty well at interrupting casters, at least in xp situations.  Of course, that assumes you actually hit with it, and it's not uncommon for a mob to &quot;regain concentration and continue casting&quot; after a successful slam/bash.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">03-04-2004, 07:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As far as I could tell, in the days of the level 60 cap, I could not kickstun any mobs that were over 55.  Once POP came out and I dinged 61, my kicks started having a chance of stunning mobs above 55.  It's not a guaranteed stun, but a chance of it.  I figured that any blue con mob was stunnable at 61+.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">03-04-2004, 10:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A warrior's kick either stuns the mob 100% or not at all from my experience.  I have never had a case where I kick something and that didn't interrupt its casting, and then it did later.  It's either the kick always interrupts, or it never interrupts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">03-04-2004, 11:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A mob can't regain concentration from a stun.  Regaining concentration is what happens from moving around.  Kick stun is basically like Phantron said, seems to vary mob to mob.  It'd be nice it if was a bit more reliable on blues / whites since I still miss or the mob blocks it some how most of the time, and it's dps is so pathetic it's not worth mentioning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">03-05-2004, 12:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also, as unreliable as our kick is at stunning, I am by far the most active stunner in my group on anything that CHs or gates, even when grouped with classes that can stun.  Our nemesis, the Paladin, seems especially lazy on the stuns.<br />
<br />
Perhaps an AA that, when maxed out, gives 100% chance kick will stun anything 65 or below that's not immune to stun would be pretty cool.  There's still only a 50% chance the kick will land.  Right now, with a very rough eye-ball estimate, I'd say it's 50/50 on level 65 mobs, and quite a bit higher on anything lower.  Seems like anything in the low 60s or lower always gets stunned by kick (unless immune of course).</div></div><hr />
