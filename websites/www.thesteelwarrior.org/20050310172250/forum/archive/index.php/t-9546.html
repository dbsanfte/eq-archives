Basically, I would like to plug a webcomic I've followed which is starting again and is looking for new people to read it. :D<br />
The exact word from the webartist in his newsblog was :<br />
<br />
<br />
That's right, next week marks the triumphant return of your favorite off-beat fantasy comic strip. I'm throwing a Slip-and-Slide party. Please come. <br />
<br />
As you know I've quit my job and am looking to make S&amp;W my full-time thing. Until Suzie View takes off, though (and it will. What you ain't heard?) it's gonna be some slim pickins around here. This thing needs to grow legs and now. Here's a few ways you can help if you are so obliged: <br />
<br />
1) Holla - Give S&amp;W a shout out at all the boards you frequent. Especially the ones you feel would enjoy the strip. If you want to shout me out at Fortune Cookie fortune writer's board then be my guest. Every little bit helps. <br />
<br />
2) Read or Die! - check the site every day for strips and news updates. Those visits show up on the Extreme tracker which makes the site more attractive to potential advertisers.<br />
<br />
And since it's in a fantasy setting, where the &quot;hero&quot; has to find a group (he's basically LFG), I thought of TSW instantly.<br />
So if you like online webcomics, click the picture and have at it. :)<br />
