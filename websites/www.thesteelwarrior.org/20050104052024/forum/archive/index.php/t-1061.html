BUT. Im interested to know if those of you  that have tried epic blade in Elementals, notice that it is very heavily resisted. Is the epic just so out of date that its useless to proc aggro in PoP? BoC works fine. Does anyone have any aggro information for using a SoD on elemental mobs?</div></div><hr />

But you're right, most people tanking in Elemental planes already have much better weapons than epics.</div></div><hr />

Sorry to say, this statement is sort of false. If the spell is resisted (fully) the hate portion is nil. If it is partially resisted, then yes, the hate portion gets through.<br />
<br />
I would have to say the SOD would actually work rather well seeing how all pop mobs hate stun.</div></div><hr />

Actually, most PoP mobs are immune to SoD stun so the agro is crap. The only people weilding SoDs in my guild are bards because they need the great DPS from the proc. I have yet to see a bard pull agro even when they rapidfire proc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even fully resisted procs generate aggro. You're right in that the fully resisted Rage of Vallon doesn't get 500 hate. But it certainly generates aggro.<br />
<br />
Or did you never notice when shamans or enchanters try to slow a mob FIVE straight times and it's resisted each time, they somehow get the mob's attention?<br />
<br />
;-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Snowz</div><div class="date">06-06-2003, 03:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">From my experiences when using epics, even back to back full resisted procs, I would not gain any agro. <br />
<br />
Though I cannot make comments on how well a SoD will gain agro, I can comment on using a BBotE. The proc (sanity warp) indeed has a tremendous amount of agro. The key is the 0.0 second stun (anarchy has this as well) which most high end pop mobs are immune to (stun). Why is the Great staff of thunder all the rave if stun did not play a part in gaining agro?<br />
<br />
Would I solely rely on using a stun weapon? No.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">06-06-2003, 12:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am retracting my comment on stun immune mobs. Apparently our warriors just have way better agro generating weapons than a bard proc'ing an SoD can overcome. I had the chance to off tank a Prot of Zek last night when we did Vindi and that sucker was glued to my warrior weilding a GSoT even though I got the stun immune message.<br />
<br />
Incidently, when the PoZ added, 2 warriors jumped on the add - me on my 2-boxed 55 war w/GSoT and another 2-boxed 61 war dual weilding epics. Since both where 2 boxed, they basically whacked away unattended. Both warriors where in my group so I could watch who was taking damage and other than getting initial agro which took about 5-10 seconds, the 61 war never dropped below 100% health.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Injektilo</div><div class="date">06-06-2003, 02:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I used a SOD with my BoC before i got a Blade of War for a couple months while we were in the elementals.  Honestly its still a decent taunter if you dont have dual hates, ive got a slew of other weapons to pair with the BoC and realistically the only combo that i could keep aggro with was the BoC / SoD.  SoD still has its uses in the elementals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GSW</div><div class="date">06-07-2003, 08:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So...does the epic work on in tier 3, or does it get resisted there also? I have used it in tier 2 and don't see a problem, really hope it still works in tier 3 :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spinetwist</div><div class="date">06-07-2003, 12:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh dont get me wrong. It works in elementals, its just heavily resisted making it very less efficient.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tenakha</div><div class="date">06-07-2003, 12:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;Is the epic just so out of date that its useless&quot;<br />
<br />
The above statement is correct.  You can sell the dropable parts of the epic quest for enough plat to easily buy weapons &gt; the epic in the bazaar and hence it should never be used other than for looks or RP reasons.</div></div><hr />
