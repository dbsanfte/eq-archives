Okies, embarassed to post that, but I've been visiting here regularly for about a week and think you guys are all great! (even the sk's) Anyhow, I've been playing eq about 6 weeks now, i started on a blue server, raised a warrior to 20 in my noob armor, and decided that the real fun would be in PvP, so here I am on Sullon Zek. I played a rogue on sullon for about a week on the neutral team, and ended up making alot of friends on the good team. So, I decided to reroll a good warrior, sell all my rogue gear, and see what I could do. One thing I kept in mind was MR is critical in pvp, though it seems now that my ac is severely lacking. I have a very low budget (about 500pp) at the moment, though more is added everyday. my current wish list includes Silver Chitin Handwraps, and an Acrylia BP or Iksar regen BP. I started leveling in Gfay, moved to Crushbone, (can solo emperor crush now = P) and for the last 5 levels have been in Unrest, where I am at this point the prefered tank, and tanking seems easy in a group of 4+ here. I have set high goals, any input would be helpful. I only included inventory items i switch in for when needed. One thing i am missing is LDoN expansion, have all others, havent been able to find it in stores. Good exping option when unrest runs drie, and gear help = ) Thanks!</div></div><hr />
