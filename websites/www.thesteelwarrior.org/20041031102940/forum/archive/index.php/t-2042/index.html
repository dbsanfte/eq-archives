<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mastoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What are a good set of primary / off hand 1hs that <br />
I can use from 35 to 51.<br />
<br />
So if you had to say:<br />
<br />
Sword a and b til 51<br />
<br />
Sword c and d til 60 etc.<br />
<br />
I'd like to see the diff opnions to this question to see if theres a consistency or a wide range of answers.<br />
<br />
**Edit**<br />
<br />
So from 35 to 51, this warrior , who is a barbarian btw, is going to be mostly grouping, just getting slow steady xp. Maybe MT a raid here and there. So DPS would be his primary concern I'm assuming as well as keeping skills maxed. After 51, he'll be moving more towards Raid MT status slowly but surely. My main is a 65 druid and is capable of raising funds for the most part but I know what ubah shit is, i'm trying to find out more variety from people more experienced than I am.<br />
<br />
The onlyl thing I'm goig to try and farm for him is a Vindi BP.<br />
My guild may do AoW and random off the loot for our alts but I never win randoms so I'm not going to count on that any time soon.<br />
<br />
Also just to TOTALLY show my noobness. What do the following items go for , roughly.<br />
<br />
a) SBoD b) Bloodfrenzy c)Windblade<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You will probably see about a million different answers, particularly since you are not specific about what you plan to use these the weapons for - whether you need agro or DPS will change answers greatly. Also the availability of weapons will change answers a lot. If you have a high level main capable of a) farming a ton of plats or b) killing some named for nice NO DROP gear then your options are going to vary greatly from a guy who has 5k to spend and a guild that hasn't killed Vindi.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Frostbringer will last you a good while whether you want it for DPS or aggro.   Prices vary so much from server that it's tough to say what things sell for, but if it has a hate proc and is droppable, expect to pay through the nose for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Truelove</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">SBoD on TT goes for 120K ish I hear - but its a PoS imho and you will be lucky to sell, BF is no drop - if it were droppable it would be worth 2-3 times a BoC maybe - its a hypothetical question. Windblade is down to 30K on TT.<br />
<br />
Dont take this the wrong way - but even the top guilds dont /random BoCs to alts, you might get a helm but I would suggest flogging that and getting a full suite of SS armour MQs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Hyardgune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Don't go all 1hs, work up your other weapon skills too.<br />
<br />
Other than that, go for the old favorites, Jade Mace, Lammy, Frosty, Reaver.  Find a decent 2hb as well, never hrts to practice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mastoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm going to be working on 2HS as well....<br />
<br />
Unfortunately time and money are not going to allow me to max all skills i bet though.</div></div><hr />
