<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gaspie</div><div class="date">09-19-2004, 02:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, get me one too. But the best armor you can buy won't help you unless you level fast. Helmet or Rallos Zek doesn't have a required level though...<br />
<br />
With so many new items coming out I'm not sure what to suggest. =\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rhyls</div><div class="date">09-19-2004, 03:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A BoC for 165k would be gone in minutes on my server.  <br />
<br />
Gaspie is right, with all the level limits in place, I would not spend big on outfitting your warrior until at least 55, or you will end up buying and selling more than you would want. <br />
<br />
I also agree that a Helmet of Rallos Zek would be a great purchase, not just due to the lack of a level limit, but also the fact that you (probably) won't replace it for a very long time.<br />
<br />
Edit: I don't think Boots of the Storm have a level limit either, that might be worth a look....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">milloeq</div><div class="date">09-19-2004, 06:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Get a good set of weapons and some haste, and dont bother with high end armor till you get to at least 50, or else like others said you'll be buying and selling too much.  I'd recommend the newer plate smithed armors, like sandblasted or gothic steel.  Or perhaps some Crustacean shell, for the mega stamina boost.  And either a Fungi or Ceremonial Iksar Chestplate works wonders, the Regen makes you unkillable through the lower levels.  Just get solid AC and some HP rings/earrings to round it out.  All this is cheap stuff you can level quickly with and save your cash for when you can get full benefits out of the recommended levels.<br />
<br />
Edit:  check out this magelo of a warrior i just threw together in about 20 minutes.  22% haste from the SCHW (3k or less)  and almost 500hp at lvl 1... weapons as personal preferences dictate, but none of the gear on this character costs over 5k, total prolly about 12-15k worth of gear depending on the weapon expenditures, or you can substitute a regen tunic for the Velium BP.  This set up will easily get you to 40, when you can start substituting out for more expensive lvl 50+ recommended gear.<br />
<br />
lvl 1 warrior (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1112248) check him out</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frostpaw</div><div class="date">09-19-2004, 07:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A full suit of Helanic Tundra, the BoC, SCHW, and some Velium Fire wedding rings would leave you a small fortune in the bank to gear up with when you hit 50's. I'd buy the BoC now and get 65 levels worth of use out of it versus waiting till you level 50 and getting 15 levels of use from it. Its still great ratio/stats/hp's that will work really well even without it proccing.</div></div><hr />

165k - buy it<br />
Make him RZ Believer for sweet deity based armour<br />
<br />
just use a formula of about 10hp per AC <br />
dont waste too much cash at start , try to get ornate when its cheap for later levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frostpaw</div><div class="date">09-19-2004, 08:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pass on ornate unless there are no other buyable upgrades for you.</div></div><hr />
