<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sonan</div><div class="date">11-16-2003, 09:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was lfg in BB a few weeks ago I actually heard that in OOC. With the ease of LDON adventures and classes overlapping, I didn't think there was any such thing as a NEEDED class anymore. After reading the posts on Pallys, only one thing really needs to be done and a couple of things I would like to see done.<br />
          The thing that would solve the aggro problems is not give us more but give the Pallys less. Increasing ours would probably screw up some high level raids from verants point of view at least. When a 58 pally can keep aggro from my 63 warrior and by keeping aggro I mean glued, something is seriously fucked. <br />
        Stun needs to take away aggro instead of increasing it. Of course the mob will beeline to the girly man in the shiny armor but then the battle changes. The mob gets hit by stun and in a semi-conscious state recieves a moment of clarity. He thinks to himself &quot;was that a shammy that just slowed me?&quot;, or &quot; Did someone just heal the guy that I was beating on?&quot;, or &quot;Is that a rogue behind me or is someone just glad to see me?&quot;. The mob would refocus his attention on the people who are making the battle go bad for him. This would penalize a chain stunning MT and make him fight like a man. Stun would have to be used in an emergency like a gating mob or Ch'ing one, but they should not be rewarded for using it.<br />
          Actually, the way taunt is set up for warriors seems to be ok. Using proximity, I can usually get back aggro in an aggressive LDON group in one refresh of taunt. This should keep the casters on their toes, keep roots memed, keep backup healers prepared, keeps everyone awake. The way the pallys have it now is just plain too easy.<br />
          Two other things I would like to see added is a melles ability to pacify and maybe a rez potion. The mellee pac could be like an entice or something that would lead a mob from his post without alarming any mobs in chain range. &quot;psst c'mere&quot;. This could have a limited effect in that you could use it only from a short range from real aggro range. If mob came within real aggro range while still in chain range, then the chain would activate. Using this would take some skill and practice but I don't know if it could be coded in a patch. I think it would be a less effective pacify but at the same time take away from the Pallys NEEDED status. <br />
          Rez potions would be cool to have but I don't think they would ever happen because they would make difficult raids easier by letting someone with fd have some potions instead of camping clerics. In any case this would take some utility from our Pally friends. I'd like to see some profit margins built in for the shammys like 80 plat to make or something but really I think clerics would have fits if this went thru.<br />
         I know that overlapping utility is the desired effect for LDON and it is very nice that i can whip up a sucessfull group in 10 minutes from a myriad of classes. but the fact that a warrior is this good at getting groups together should emphasize the fact that we need to regain our MT status. LFG/on and pray.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mystaviant</div><div class="date">11-16-2003, 10:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What you may not realize is that with a decent 2 hander, and a few spells, that pally will waste your dps on undead. Its what they were meant to do, same reason you see pallies as the pretty much exclusive tanks in CoD.<br />
<br />
Also, the group could have had 5 peeps in it, as follows<br />
<br />
druid<br />
shammy<br />
dps<br />
dps<br />
dps<br />
<br />
while that group would do fine with a pally, any other tank would pull 5 mobs at a time in places, and lead to a sure wipe, as pacify is the way to go on some pulls.  <br />
<br />
Now if that group was like this:<br />
<br />
cleric<br />
chanter<br />
shammy<br />
dps<br />
dps<br />
<br />
and they still &quot;needed&quot; a pally, then, yes, they need strung up by thier toenails and beaten with a wet noodle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">11-16-2003, 11:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The current agro on stun is a fix for a different problem.<br />
<br />
Chain stunning. It is possible to keep mobs chain stunned for a significant period of time, the only thing that is stopping clerics and wizards from chain stunning is the agro on the spell. Now they are used in a balanced way by those 2 classes...as interrupts and not ghetto slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">11-16-2003, 04:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe they already had a warrior tank and a druid healer and they wanted a pally in their group for buffs and rez and better DPS than a cleric.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deadalus</div><div class="date">11-16-2003, 05:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Let's not get so focused on stuns as to forget that a hybrid can get agro with many other spells too, they just use stuns cause they're easiest. Flash of light is terrific agro; it acts like a fear if EVERYONE moves out of a blinded mob's melee range, but how often does that happen? Same goes for heals, they agro great too. Calling for a stun nerf won't work, because they're far from the only agro machine in a pally's spellbook. <br />
<br />
Only two approaches I see working are: <br />
1) increase warrior agro to match, or <br />
2) rework hybrid spells so that they're all separate, paladin-only spells and then make them generate vastly reduced amounts of agro. You can't change the spells as they are because the change would affect a lot of other classes<br />
<br />
Option 1) seems a lot easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jynn Tlespirit</div><div class="date">11-17-2003, 02:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not sure why this is so far fetched.  I often hear groups asking for one specific class to round out their group.  Without knowing who else they had in group it's rather difficult to assume they needed a pally to chain stun their way through the adventure and thereby knock a warrior out of a job.  I do several groups with warriors as main tanks and me as a filler.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">11-17-2003, 09:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm pretty sure a Paladin cannot pacify anything on LDoN, even normal.  Everything is higher than level 55 (minus the trap mobs which are exactly 55) which is their pacify limit I think.<br />
<br />
There's a lot Paladins can do but pacing in LDoN isn't one of them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wyvernwill</div><div class="date">11-17-2003, 10:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Paladin pacify is completely useless in LDoN.  Just to clear that up.<br />
<br />
A lot of times, groups find themselves in very dangerous positions when they don't have people focusing on stunning a gating/CHealing mob.  Clerics *can* along with Wizards, but the problem is when you add in healing, that can create a dangerous situation.<br />
<br />
For a side note... if I were given the ability to chain stun with losing agro... It would just make me more apt to lock down a mob with stuns so it can't move and just not let it hit anyone at all.<br />
<br />
They very well could have wanted the paladin in the BB adventure simply for DPS.  Blackblade of the Rain + Ward of Nife + Slay Undead ends up being extremely high amounts of damage when you factor in a 300 DD proc, 125 DD proc and Crits from 400-2400 damage.  Two handers are nice, but end up actually making Slay undead a lot less effective.</div></div><hr />

Really, please think about these things. The original poster never made a distinction about what level the group was or the level of the pally they were looking for.<br />
<br />
In a group that is roughly level 55, a paladin could reasonably pacify the entire dungeon since you'll never see a critter over level 54.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Adarian</div><div class="date">11-18-2003, 12:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For all I care as a paladin you could strip the whole pacify line out of the game even on chanters and clerics and I really would not see a single bit of difference on any day of the week. I have never used my pacify line for anything usefull. It was a broken spell for so long that by the time it was fixed it would work on about nothing i hunted. Wish they would justt take the line out of the game and be done with it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Adzar</div><div class="date">11-18-2003, 11:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have grouped with several pallies and they have pacified and pulled. If they had no puller and limited crowd control that could be a potential reason for needing a pally. Not to say they needed him to tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Carwenst</div><div class="date">11-18-2003, 11:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just a thought on this, the group could also have needed a pally to grab aggro fast for slows and debuffs to land and then allow another tank to take over. I've done this in LDoN to maximize speed and healing efficiency and I did it all last night in PoV. It works wonders when people realize that this is a group game and people could and should rely on their group members. I hate that fact sometimes, that's why I keep my necro alt :) .</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, the original poster didn't, but the Mystaviant did imply that, which is who Phantron was replying to. The fact is that it isn't until SU and perhaps Deny Undead that a paladin will &quot;waste your dps on undead&quot;. The assumption that he was talking about 60+ players is a fair one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smohg</div><div class="date">11-18-2003, 11:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yesterday I had the day off. Trying to get a LDON group I was told twice that the group wanted a knight for a tank - although aggro isnt a problem for me. The people that tried to get me in a group knew me but couldnt convince the group that I could hold aggro. I have all major offensive AA, BoW, BF/primal combo, elemental/VT gear, but ANY old level 61+ knight would be better than me?<br />
<br />
Well, I got news. That isnt a problem SOE created because I can tank the crap out of stuff but a few idiots just wont group with warriors. Oh well.<br />
<br />
I did get a group though. A pally guildmate grabbed me for the DPS spot. I did get to off tank though /rolleyes</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jynn Tlespirit</div><div class="date">11-18-2003, 12:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Regardless of how balanced the classes are, there is no cure for stupidity of the people playing the characters.  I almost always play back up tank to our warrior in adventure groups and we whip right through them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Steenky</div><div class="date">11-18-2003, 01:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hell, I play back-up tank to rangers nowadays since noone knows how to, or rather wants to control their aggro. Btw, in a normal LDoN adventure the ranger tanked just fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Boleslav</div><div class="date">11-18-2003, 02:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the break point for a level 65 LDoN adventure is having an average group level of 63+.  If the average group level is under 63 a Paladin will be able to Pacify pull most, if not all, of an adventure.  Meanwhile if the group level is 63+ the Paladin will not be able to pacify anything except perhaps a DC mob.<br />
<br />
Paladins are formidable tanks, and the perception of them is even greater for undead environments.  It is not surprising that a group felt they needed a Paladin, even though it is quite unlikely that they actually required one to succeed.  In this case perception is greater than reality.  The amount of undead in the Mistmoore adventures has been significantly reduced recently.  Shadows and 'zombie rats' are no longer undead.  I find the mix of undead in most Mistmoore adventures to be under 50% now.  I don't even load my undead proc or damage spell there any more.  So the reality is that a Paladin is not required for a BB (or any other) adventure, yet the group felt that they needed one.<br />
<br />
I can see how this is infuriating to Warriors.  Let's hope the upcoming changes help balance the situation a bit.<br />
