Valdoon has an AE Drunk ability. With max or near max AT you are immune to the effect. It's a PoTime level LDoN raid (albeit probably by far the easiest of them all).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Krassus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">thats some shit, i was just joking about AE drunk =D guess good guess. I was a little saucy too getting ready to go out and see a bunch on naked EP geared people drinking mass alcohol and duelnig each other and was like WTF</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jinaabi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">From my experience, there are chests with this trap on it. It is 2 fold. First, it is a curse which drops all your stats down to the same level as if you had wulfed down 20 short beers. The second part is the actual 'drunk' effects. Eventually, the 'drunk effect' will where off like a normal drunk will. However, if you do not cure the curse, your stats will remain at 1 even though the tunnel vision/sway, and slurred speach will go away.<br />
<br />
I think the main reason to have 200AT is for the drunk effects to be nulled. The curse would still need to be cured or your stats will be at 'suck'.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grimmlokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The main reason to have 200 AT is to prove you have a massive wang and a hairy chest. But that only works if you had 200 AT before Kunark. Anything later and you're obviously just trying to fit in at parties. You probably dump the booze over your shoulder half the time, pussy!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zackulle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I think im the only person I know who had max alc tolerance at like lvl 20... waaaaaay before kunark... *shrug*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Chatja ogre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You probably mean level 39 )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zynth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">i heard some where looong ago that AT decreases the duration of posions that hit you. anyone else comfirm this, or is it just a stupid rumor? i never bothered to find out if it was true or not, besides, why would i look for a reason to drink less :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Chatja ogre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">That's a rumor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>zaos13</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">they are on a set number of ticks(6 seconds)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ylander</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Next they will put in a mob that requires max begging. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Remf da Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Hope they use a good character model for it- lots of polygons in the right places, etc. ;)  And no damn butterfly wings...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Back in the day we used to camp the bandits in butcherblock while drunk.  Was me, another barb warrior, a dwarf cleric and a dwarf paladin.  Occasionally  others of our friends would join us. Nothing like being 14th level, pounding down about a stack of gnomish spirits, and pulling Peg Leg over to your group.  (sometimes things went south if the cleric overdid the drinking though).  <br />
PS: Never drink with a dwarf that brews his own booze.</div></div><hr />
