<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Slammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What are your thoughts???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Coray</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well it depends on the situation but I will say that lifetaps are virtually useless and there is no situation in which they are of any value.<br />
<br />
The reason is that at the stage where you're considering augmenting a sews with anything, a 75 point lifetap is a tiny water molecule in a huge bucket of water.  In a situation when you are tanking, 75 hitpoints is nothing and same if you aren't and snag a round of rampage or an AOE lands.<br />
<br />
The question is, do you want/need more aggro, then yes go with ykesha but you must remember that it goes both ways.  You may generate some more aggro when tanking, but you will also when not tanking.<br />
<br />
I put the ruj 510 point 125 poison based dd on my bow because I don't have any aggro issues when I am the main tank and I don't want aggro issues when I'm not main tank.  Works good and lands on just about everything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Slammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes at times my problem has been Aggro, Just on start of MTing a boss such as MM,Grummus, and Bertox..At the start of the fights its taken me a good 15 - 20 secs getting them LOCKED down on me. I know i could hold off on Calling Assist. But, I dont like to do that, that is one of the reasons I posted this you are right in alot of ways thanks for your thoughts. I will be going with Ykesha on it.When i am just assisting our MT i will just use my Norge tal..( I am a 2hs freak &lt;3 )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tinmari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">While you folks are giving advice, I could use some.<br />
<br />
So far, I don't have a decent PoP 2h, but I know I should get one soon.  I use jagged shard of frozen flame and a BoC most of the time.  I switch hands based on how badly I need to get aggro.  Lately in the elementals, I've been using BoC in main hand and a fb3 shield in the offhand.  Aggro has not been too bad.<br />
<br />
The question or advice I need is that I have almost enough points to buy the 125dd ykesha proc.  Which weapon would be the best to put it on?  I was going to put it on the BoC, but everyone I suggest that to seems to cringe at the idea. <br />
<br />
There is also a rumor that type 4 augments can not be removed.<br />
<br />
Any advice would be appreciated :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>dethvegi1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You can remove type 4 aug's ...  Look for the slot 1 solvent at any Magus in the ldon camps.  They sell for 15p iirc.  put the solvent and the weapon you want to remove aug with into the birdbath and combine. you'll lose the augment but it will be off the weapon at least ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Coray</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I was going to put it on the BoC, but everyone I suggest that to seems to cringe at the idea. <br />
<br />
The BoC.  The reason is similar, in that ykesha proc is there to get more aggro, since there are cheaper ones that do just as much damage.  <br />
<br />
In two of your three setups, the boc is in mainhand and responsible for generating aggro, so it only makes sense that it gets the augment and then is able to do its job better. <br />
<br />
At the same time, this leaves the shard for DPS duty in mainhand.<br />
<br />
This is similar to the other one in that you need to examine the complete picture.  If you put it on the shard, you instantly have two aggro weapons and no, or lackluster dps ones, and in the case where you use a shield with the boc, the ykesha proc is absolutely useless since it's in your bag.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Splaktar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You would only put lifetap procs on your DPS weapons that you use when not tanking.  That way you could improve your survivability, especially for AE mobs.<br />
<br />
If you are going to use the weapon for aggro, then put Ykesha on it for sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mepje</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I still have 2 blood points in the bank. The have an 80hp lifetap already on them. In combination with another lifetap it would be very interesting to see how a warrior would handle himself.<br />
No question that it is not to usefull as an agro set of weps or against highly resistant mobs but in dungeon crawls and normal single group events it will be of great assistance to the healers in your party.<br />
<br />
Just a thought and wondering what you guys think about it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ladas Sindarin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Just for some reference...<br />
<br />
My Acrylia Handled Broadsword proc (100 unresitable tap), combined with Spell Casting Fury 3 (10% chance to crit blast for 2x damage) and Healing Gift 3 and Healing Adept 3 averaged about 3 to 5 HP/sec regen as a non-tanking class.  5 HP/sec was at the upper end and usually only when I was consistantly taking damage (hits on riposte, pull, AE, etc).  Obviously, if I haven't taken any damage then there isn't any healing.<br />
<br />
Since Warriors don't have any healing AAs, with Ingenuity, you at best, with a 75 point tap, would be looking at around 2-3 HP/sec regen equivilent, assuming no resists.<br />
<br />
I doubt that truely adds as much survivability as implied by some people.<br />
<br />
Granted, I'm a ranger, but after considering the choices, I have ruled out the Tap proc and looking for the 150 DD or the 125 DD.... spending less points for a bigger DPS improvement.  And I have Advanced Healing Gift 3 and Avanced Healing Adept 3 to at least give my taps a bit bigger boost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Spliskin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If we used the &quot;average&quot; proc rate of 2x per minute, wouldnt a 75hp proc give you 150hp, or 15hp per tick &quot;regen&quot; as you prefer to call it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jateki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well it depends on the situation but I will say that lifetaps are virtually useless and there is no situation in which they are of any value. <br />
My Emp sword easily procs 2-3 times per minute. I'll use 2 for the sake of arguement and lets say 2 of those procs are crits. Typical boss fight is 10 minutes on average. That would equal 2200 healed over 100 tics or a regen of 22hp per tic. <br />
<br />
I want to add the 75pt lifetap to my Emp sword. If I can manage to get the to augment to proc once per minute and lets say 1 of those is a crit that would add 825 healed over 100 tics or a regen of 8.25 per tic. Bringing my new total to around 30hp per tic. Not a bad situational weapon at all.<br />
<br />
Emp Sword - 30hp<br />
Current gear- 27hp<br />
Spiritual Dominion - 9hp<br />
Blessing of Replenishment - 25hp<br />
------------------------------------------<br />
Total - 91hp per tic<br />
<br />
That would equal 9100hp healed over a typical 10 minute fight. That's hardly useless, but it is very situational. It's not a bad way to add dps in some of the current AE situaltions. I could add another 20 from a bard twisting Chorus of Marr and then another 15 from slapping on my fungi but that just wouldn't be normal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>KaoraEci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Those were my thoughts exactly Jateki. <br />
I like to solo a lot for fun and farming/faction, so i tend to use my emp sword in favor of bow, for the lifetap. I added the 75 lifetap to it as well and I love it. Works very very well for staying alive while not MT and for farming greens and light blue mobs. Even works well for PoI or PoN soloing.<br />
<br />
Now to just keep a look out for an AoE aug ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
I cut out a lot of stuff that doesn't relate to what I'm going to say.  I'm going to assume you meant 1 of the 2 crits in your first line instead of 2 of 2.  Either way of course that is significantly flawed because you won't see anywhere near a 50% crit rate, you'll see a 7% crit rate.<br />
<br />
The 75 point lifetap proc will go off around 2 times a minute which does in fact come out to healing around 15 damage a tick.<br />
<br />
But that's making it something it isn't, and when you look at it for what it actually is, a heal for less than 1% of your total hitpoints, it's a little different story.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jateki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">It's pretty easy to understand what I said by looking at the math.<br />
20 * 100 = 2000 + 200(from 2 crits) = 2200<br />
<br />
I used 10% as the chance to crit on a proc.<br />
<br />
Then you say:<br />
The 75 point lifetap proc will go off around 2 times a minute which does in fact come out to healing around 15 damage a tick. <br />
Hell, I would be happy with half of that. Which would be:<br />
<br />
10 * 75 = 750 + 75(from 1 crit) = 825<br />
Either way of course that is significantly flawed because you won't see anywhere near a 50% crit rate, you'll see a 7% crit rate. <br />
I was using 10% for my crit rate, hardly that far off from your 7% crit rate. I have no idea where you came up with a 50% crit rate. If anything, my estimate was on the low side of the potential value.<br />
But that's making it something it isn't, and when you look at it for what it actually is, a heal for less than 1% of your total hitpoints, it's a little different story.<br />
That just confused me. What exactly am I making it into other than a situational weapon?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ladas Sindarin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Errr... that should have read 2-3 regen per sec, not tick.  Thanks for the catch.  I was working with the DPS change in a 150 DD versus a 75 point tap, which is the same as the healing per sec.  I mentally switched from DPS to the way regen is normally expressed (per tick), but forgot to multiply by 6.<br />
<br />
But that doesn't change my opinion.  I would still rather do an extra 2-3 DPS than regen an extra 2-3 per sec considering how hard mobs hit, how long raid targets last and the size of the AEs, and the cost in LDoN points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Spliskin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The perspective of warriors on weapons with lifetaps is a bit different than a Rangers I would think, since we can't heal ourselves or regen ourselves.  Nice to have for farming stuff where you would eventually slowly lose hp and would have to stop to bind wound otherwise.<br />
<br />
I do think the price of the 75hp lifetap is excessive, which is why I went with the 50hp lifetap for my Palladius axe at 1/3 the price.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Draganetti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Perhaps I'm simple minded.<br />
<br />
Put +aggro procs on your aggro weapons.<br />
<br />
Put +damage procs on your dps/low-aggro weapons.<br />
<br />
If you want to solo farm green mobs with lifetap procs, do that on your own time.<br />
<br />
The logic of putting a DD proc on a BoW mystifies me.  Of course, people that use a BoW while someone else is supposed to be tanking mystifies me too.  Just two nights ago I had nearly double the dps of another warrior, neither of us were MT, he was trying to use his BoW, turning off attack to avoid dying repeatedly.  I was using some crappy 35/24 2h.  He parsed at 17k for the fight, i had 30k.  So put yak on your main aggro weapon and put a high DD proc on a non-aggro weapon.  Halleluja.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gerald</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I don't think I'd ever waste extra points to have a 75 HP life tap over something like a 150 DD proc for half the price. I pretty much just raid and sometimes group for exp. The 150 DD improving my DPS is a greater benefit for me. If your situation is different, then so may be your choice. Personally I'll be putting the either the lowest Ykesha proc or the 125 DD ykesha proc on my BoWar when I finally win one though. I'll mostly want it for agro's sake, and I'm not sure if I want to spend the extra points for a little bit larger DD portion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">currently vamp proc suck you into the mob not a good idea if trying to stay at max melee or swiming.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I've used an Acryla Handled Broadsword and Jaelen's Katana (switching in a Stone Etched Mallet when I'm at 100%) as non-aggro weapons in raids, groups, and soloing.<br />
<br />
Reposte damage usually negates any benefits from healing in raids. In LDoN Normal I can switch stuff in and out with my aggro weapons and prop up my HP's quite a bit, but frankly I'm not a mana burden to heal in the first place. They're useful when soloing I suppose - I can solo in a couple of zones for experiance non-stop, but the kill rate and exp is so low (one blue tick a kill) that it's not worth doing.<br />
<br />
I am starting to think about an augment for my Ornate Greatblade. Since it's my usual non-aggro weapon I want a non-aggro augment. Are the Vampire augs the ony choice??<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Jateki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">They fixed the push back in the last patch. I added the 50pt Vampire Talon (340 Points in BB) to my Emp sword and so far I think it gets resisted too much. I'm glad I didn't spend 1150 points on the Vampire Kiss augment. <br />
<br />
In my opinion, they need to make these lifetap augments unresistable for them to worth the points they cost. The Vampire Kiss augment does have a -25 resist check but I really think it would need to be around -200 to worthwhile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Stikka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">As a Rogue I like lifetaps, they are low aggro, ok DPS and help as for obvious reasons the tanks get the healers attention.<br />
For a tank I would say that a lifetap is less than ideal.<br />
<br />
A guildmate has a Yak augmented SeWS and he loves it, as do I as I have to work really really hard to drag aggro off him and his Yak proc snaps it back.<br />
<br />
Yak-SeWS from a roguely perspective is very satisfactory for my tank :D</div></div><hr />
