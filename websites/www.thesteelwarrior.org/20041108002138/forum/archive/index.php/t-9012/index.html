<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The three Plate tanks each have the ability to add a proc buff to their weapon. Excluding items which may be right-clicked to accomplish this, we now have;<br />
<br />
Paladins<br />
Ward of Nife:  ~300DD vs. undead/1 hour duration<br />
Pious Might: 90DD + stun/1 hour duration<br />
<br />
Shadow Knight<br />
Shroud of Chaos: 65 lifetap (much more with appropriate AA?)/1 hour duration<br />
Shroud of Discord: 115 lifetap (much more with appropriate AA?)/1 hour duration<br />
<br />
Warrior<br />
Aura of Runes Discipline: When it procs, it puts a 400 HP damage absorb buff in the Bard song window for up to 5 ticks.<br />
Duration 1 minute/Reuse 15 Minutes<br />
<br />
Both Paladins and Shadow Knights have a weapon proc self-buff that can be kept on the weapon for all practical purposes at all times and is arguably as good as procs generally found built into weapons or obtainable with augments.<br />
<br />
This Warrior weapon self-buff is available only ~7% of the time and although the 400HP absorb is more powerful in the amount of absorption than is found on most weapon procs (BBB, SEWS - Rune III/230 HP),mobs do hit a little harder since we moved on from Ssra and PoEarth. And the persistance of the Rune Effect buff is patheticly short (Rune III ~1 hour) vs. 5 ticks.<br />
<br />
Compared to the weapon proc self-buffs the other two Plate tanks recieve, it's pathetic.<br />
<br />
Compared to weapon proc buffs Warriors could do with 2 or 3 year old right-clickable items like Gloves of the Crimson Sigil and Symbol of the Planesmasters, it's pathetic.<br />
<br />
Compared to the 100% of the time availablity and persistance of buffs like Rune III available on weapons from previous content or procs from augments, it's pathetic.<br />
<br />
Concidering that Warriors have only 2 disciplines that can be obtained from single-groupable mobs the drop Muramite runes, I'm shocked something as weak as this that's only available ~7% of the time would even be put in the game.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">you'r right in essence ... but warrior disc has always been like this.<br />
since you can't use this and def at the same time so you will still use your right click when tanking boss.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Defensive, Furious, Provoke, etc. aren't like this.<br />
<br />
We get so gdf little flexability in the first place, you'd think SoE would excercise just a little thought.<br />
<br />
Pah! I'm going to log in my 53 Paladin, grab my Fabled Ghoulbane, buff with Instrument of Nife and solo the KC basement for an hour. Sometimes I just can't stand the cavalier attitude that SoE displays toward Warriors - here's a useless discipline, give it to Warriors. They're such stupid meatshields they won't even realize half of their only two single-groupable OoW disciplines is a joke :mad:.<br />
<br />
BB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Darkgecko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think I understand your point, and agree mostly.  <br />
Maybe I dont understand the purpose of this ability.  I read it as a great way to build aggro, and mitigate some damage.  It sounds to me like you wanted this to be just more dps?<br />
<br />
The Paladin's Pious Might line has no stun portion, and (fine with me) is fairly low aggro.  These have a set proc rate, and add ~2dps.<br />
The Shadowknight Lifetap line is, for the most part (from reading sk.org mostly), dps more then anything.  The healing is fairly minimal compared to mob dps these days, and like the Pious Might spells, isn't that high aggro.  I have not seen dps parses of these spell procs, but they will have a set proc rate as well.<br />
<br />
I suppose what really matters is, what is the proc rate on this?  If it's going to proc 10% of the time for that 1 minute, it's pretty nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">all the OoW disc are jokes espacially when the end cost is add in.<br />
but, as I said this summer, I didn't expect any usefull disc with OoW.<br />
yes a rune proc of such power would have been usefull on low hitting boss if it would have stayed longer (3min like our other def disc) and if it would have been a fourth proc (not a replace of the third).<br />
<br />
EDIT : or  if it was procing a 1000damege rune on every swing for 12s it would replace the furious</div></div><hr />

I appreciate that you understand some of my bitter disapointment with half of my non-raid obtained disciplines.<br />
<br />
Please understand that within the limits of a Warrior's ability to grab and hold aggro, we've already got it - even Bazu's Bellow is a marginal upgrade. I'm very unlikely to weild a weapon that proc'd a Rune III that persisted, certainly not for aggro (Rune IV and I might say screw aggro/gimmie Rune!!). That's part of the point - 7% of the time availability is just plain ^%$#.<br />
<br />
I'm not terribly interested in DPS either. Our other non-raid obtainable discipline's not huge DPS, but at least I'll be able to do something when the raid leader says, &quot;Offensive Disciplines Now!&quot;.<br />
<br />
It's really just somewhat disapointment over something that could have been worthwhile and isn't. Change the the discipline to add a Rune III proc buff and have it last an hour and it's better than this. Now I feel like I have only 1 discipline I'll get outside of raids (and therefore sometime in the next 3 months).<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Archonfire</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It is worthwhile.<br />
<br />
Procs a decent amount of time, and is not on either Furious, or Defensive, timer. This is a perfect disc with which to end the classic furious &gt; defensive chain.<br />
<br />
Previously insane mobs will become much more palatable with this disc.<br />
<br />
Further, 1 min/15 reuse is one of our best recycling times, barring defensive/stonewall.<br />
<br />
Have you even tried this disc out yet?<br />
<br />
Bazu Bellow is a HUGE. With just the Bellow alone (no melee, nothing else), you have just created enough agro to counteract a slow on incoming. You just became a frigging paladin! Hello, this is SoE, we just gave you Enraging Blow with 100 range, a 30 second recast, and a dot component that kicks fucking ass. Are you happy?<br />
<br />
HELLZ NO THIS SUKX WE NEDE UTUILITY. ALZO OUR DISCS SUK TEHEHEheheheheh<br />
<br />
Come on guys, this is getting ridiculous.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For starters, the only Rune I have not seen drop off single group content so far (and I bet I will see one) is the lvl70 rune. The Lvl69 is more rare, but that is what I expected.<br />
<br />
With the recycle on the disc, this one is not bad. Not great, but I now have 3 defensive type dics I can chain when I need to. And better yet the Rune should act as a taunt to all the mobs in camp.<br />
<br />
Just got mine last night (damn them casters with their good rolls) so I'll be trying it out today.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Daabu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'm inclined to agree. Stop bitching about how useless it is.  i'd like to see a few changes, but whining like a little girl with a skinned knee isn't going to get us there.<br />
<br />
I'd like for it not to overwrite clicky proc buffs (even though I don't have one, and don't plan on getting one in the future).<br />
<br />
I'd like for it to proc more than 4ppm.<br />
<br />
That said, it doesnt suck.<br />
A 400pt rune *IS* significant, even if it's only 4 times in a minute.  YOU may not think RuneIII is a worthwhile proc, but I'd wager that my Rune3 weapon is mitigating better than you dual wielding your DBoW and EoE.<br />
<br />
That one round where you almost got 1-rounded? Rune will give you an extra 400hp.  Soloing and not quite sure if you're going to survive?  Runing while stonewall is not up will help.  Need to tank, but defensive just wore off?  Enjoy taking 20dps less.  Sure, it's not phenominal, but every little bit helps</div></div><hr />

....whining like a little girl with a skinned knee isn't going to get us there.<br />
Yes, sitting around with tears in yours eyes and blubbering incoherrantly isn't going to get you anywhere. But, like the initial post, making a persusive argument might - providing someone doesn't post a retort intended ONLY to puff themselves up and deflate the issue. I know it's hard to believe, but there are asshats that do such things.<br />
YOU may not think RuneIII is a worthwhile proc,<br />
You might check how long a Rune III proc stays on your buff bar and compare it to the 5 tick persistance of this effect. Make it proc Rune IV or even Runic and stay up for an hour once it hit and I might agree with you. Then there would be the possibility for it to be carried over unused from the end of one fight to the start of another - that's been obviously taken into account and the miniscule advantage it would confer side-stepped neatly.<br />
<br />
I'd go through the rest of your points, but the only thing you said I agree with is:<br />
...it's not phenominal...<br />
Quite the understatement.<br />
<br />
BB<br />
&quot;...it's not phenominal...&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Archonfire</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If all you can think of for this disc in terms of its usefulness is how well it will carry over into another fight after the one you initially use it on, I don't see any hope of re-educating you.<br />
<br />
Let me just ask you this: have you used it? Do you even have it? What data are you basing your &quot;objections&quot; (glorified term imo) upon?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>GraniteMG</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Being on a seperate timer makes this useful,  but everyone keeps mentioning the aggro capability of the disc, which as I understand it from everyone that has it so far, is almost non-existant. It goes in the short buff box window, and short box buffs produce a lot less aggro than real buffs. So from everything i've heard, don't count on it for more aggro.</div></div><hr />

What data are you basing your &quot;objections&quot; (glorified term imo) upon?<br />
Good point. While my concerns are based on the information in the first post, you are correct - I don't know for a fact that in actual use the proc doesn't go off regularly.<br />
<br />
Right again. I should document the &quot;as-used&quot; benefit of this. My concern is basicly that when soloing (for example) the issue is not having something like Rune III dampening down the damage I'm taking. It's having Serpent's Bite and Vampire Kiss go off enough to prop up my HP's directly - you know<br />
<br />
like a Paladin healing himself and having Knight's Blessing going off or an SK with the improved lifetaps going off.<br />
<br />
So, while I might look at the weapon self-buffs of other Warrior based classes like:<br />
Call of Fire<br />
Instrument of Nife<br />
Pious Might<br />
Improved lifetap<br />
<br />
and assume the Warrrior 7% of a Real Weapon Self-Buff sucks, maybe it's awesome.<br />
<br />
You are right - it may go off all the time, Warriors will be, just like Knights,  (for example) soloing up a storm and this will have just as much class defining impact as the Knight weapon self-buffs do for them. Awesome! It's my next AA buy!!!!<br />
<br />
Oh wait, unlike Knight weapon self-buffs this can only be put on our weapons 7% of the time. My error. Given this fact alone, it sucks. Unless of course &quot;data&quot; from Lucy doesn't count as data in your mind. 7% of the time. 7. And it's not even a heal, it's a rune. Wait, not even a real rune, it's a 5 tick maybe it's a rune/maybe it's not.<br />
<br />
BB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>GraniteMG</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">You keep pointing out the duration of the spell, but you'll get the full effect of the 400hp mitigation everytime where it matters... there's no way the rune is going to last 30 seconds fighting anything of appropriate level.<br />
<br />
The thing I think you're doing wrong here is comparing this to their line of buffs. It's not suppose to be a buff. You made this imaginary comparison with their buff lines but that isn't, and wasn't ever suppose to be what our disciplines are.<br />
<br />
We have access to buff spells, there are now quite a few items that lets us right click and get a proc buff, Call of the Sky, Call of Fire, Pestilence Shock, etc.<br />
<br />
The usefulness of this ability lies in what it is, a 3rd defensive discipline we can run.<br />
<br />
Furious - 12seconds of non-melee damage<br />
Defensive - 3 minutes of highly increased mitigation<br />
Aura of Runes - 1 minute of minimally increased mitigation<br />
<br />
When Aura of Runes wears off pop your right click back on, and if you don't have a right click be glad you got to run an extra proc that enhanced your defensive capabilities for a little bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Looking at it as better than absolutely nothing, you are correct. I suppose on those rare occassions when I don't need a good defensive discipline like Furious or Defensive, I might break this tepid thing out. Although it's a shame this is a level 66 discipline and not a level 50 one as it should be. At level 50, prior to getting Defensive, this would actually be used and appreciated. At level 70, it's really a &quot; I might as well use it since I've got it&quot; discipline. A garnish, not a main dish. To obtain this kind of capability I have a weapon that procs a Rune and has Vampire Kiss - I assure you I don't use it much on level appropriate mobs.<br />
<br />
Comparing it to the Weapon Self-Buffs other Warrior based classes get (or do you believe only Warriors shouldn't have a Weapon self-buff?), it's pretty gd awful. Here it is boys, the long awaited Warrior Weapon Self-Buff. Click it on when you start an experiance group in WoS or clearing trash in Uqua and yer all set for an hour just like the other warrior classes. Wheee!!!!!! Sorry, yer 1 minute of having the same weapon self-buff capability of other warrior-based classes is over. Please wait.<br />
<br />
I honestly can't think of when I'd bother using this unless it's vs. single-group mini-named in OoW or golems in Inktu'Ta - when real defensive disciplines aren't needed and you want to reserve them.<br />
<br />
/shrug what should have been a level 50 defensive discipline given to level 66's that's their last choice to use in  most circumstances or 7% of a Weapon Self-Buff. Either way of looking at it, it's not much.<br />

<br />
That is my ONLY complaint with Aura of Runes, as personally I like it.  Even if it is a gimmick disc, its still not that bad.  Back to my complaint however....it OVERWRITES all of our self proc buff clickies, and to me that is just plain wrong and is a pita   :mad:   But I can live with that I suppose.    As far as aggro and proc rate, their is an aggro component to the rune proc, albeit I havent tested it so far as to know its general amount but I must say its similar to the AE aggro effect of such weapons as the BBB and SEWS and I have gotten no less then 5 rune procs each time Ive used it (yes that could be good fortune but Im up to use #23 as of this writing and it could be you just have bad luck) and on at least one occasion has saved me where defensive would have been unable to. All in all....its better then nothing  :p<br />
<br />
p.s. Quote added in solely due to my lazyness in typing a line of our self proc buffs. ;)<br />
<br />
~edit~<br />
p.p.s. Another thing that seems to be a glitch is the amount of endurance used by the discipline, sometimes its not a whole lot and I could chain furious+stonewall+runes+mighty and on occasion runes by itself will massively drain me to the point I cant use bellow even.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I now have it and have used it.<br />
<br />
In fights where I don't need a discipline at all, it's ok I guess. I use it on the &quot;tougher&quot; mobs to give the Cleric a break kinda sorta maybe. I'll use it soloing, but the places I can solo for useful loot and experiance have narrowed a whole lot now that I'm 70. And the mobs in such places aren't going to be impressed by this. In fights where I do need a discipline I've used it after Furious and then Defensive. In those fights it didn't do enough really to warrant using it, but why not use it?<br />
<br />
Somewhere I read that SoE decided to give out generally weak disciplines in OoW. I suppose this would be a PvE tuning concern. Still, this and the offensive one (crips instead of crits) seem awfully weak to me. Maybe they are both intended to boost casual Warriors and do next to nothing for higher level Warriors.<br />
<br />
BB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Callon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">It could use a bit better proc rate.  I think I get around 3-4 per use on average.  A couple times when I've used it, I didn't get a single proc for the first 30 seconds of the discipline.  Like anything based on a random number generator, you'll have some streakiness.</div></div><hr />

Though it is fine if you do furious-&gt;defensive-&gt;aura of runes. <br />

He should be one groupable for you easy, looking at your magelo.  We've done it with 3 groups, and I'm just under your unbuffed HPs while &quot;buffed&quot;.  The only thing that might be a problem are the adds.  As you fight him, 2 mobs from his room are triggered to add on you about every 30 seconds.  They are easily mezzable/rootable however.</div></div><hr />
