if it's the right person she is the lasy up in the tower to the right hand side of the zone-in; swim under the water a bit to the right than go up.</div></div><hr />

I'm just starting to look into the revamped zones ... some of which I never spent much time in on my way up the ladder.  But I am seeing some very nice gear here and there (for example, my STA aug'd Grand Pauldron of Study (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=23120),  was an upgrade from my Draconic and snap easy to get) - and I think most of us know about the weapons drops in Droga :D.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">PoM revamped simply put has some damn nice plate drops. Check my shoulders, gloves and arms, and if only I had gotten the damn boots, the 20AC bracer with all the HP, etc., I'd be a happy homer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>zcao</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hey guys I am a level 51 WARRIOR, decently set up.<br />
<br />
currently have 3400 life and 1100 AC<br />

Wield copper hammer, bloodsworn, war marshall, or shadowflame<br />
<br />
I was wondering how many people of low 50s i need to take with me from my guild to take out the whore &quot;Mistress latazora&quot;.<br />
<br />
I have never been to the zone siren grotto, or cobalt scar or wester waste.<br />
<br />
Please treat me like an idiot and give me step by step direction going from POK.  and please let me know of any obstacle i would meet along the way.  Also if there are any high level on FV server who would help, it would be nice.<br />

 I gouped with you last night, with my alt, in LDoN. I got to tell you that you need to work on being a warrior a whole lot before you try something like this. <br />
<br />
In my opinion, if you go in without a raid force you will cause total group wipe. Sorry. Please peruse the library for some tips on aggro, targeting, pulling, and general mob placement. I feel that would be a much better use of your time rather than going after more equipment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bonequest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Don't even bother to go deep into SG and hope to farm it with a group of low 50's.  It would be suicide unless you are twinked beyond the point where what drops there would be an upgrade (ie. you got full VT gear or something).  Go farm Kael or Halls of Testing in ToV if you need armor at that level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shmashed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">So folks, what kinda group are we looking at minimum to put an end to this sorry little woman then?  Was your group overkill Fruzuk?  Is a very nice looking item, cant wait to get my hands on one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gabriel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">We did her with a 65 Shaman, 65 Beast and my 65 Necro.  She is easy if she is casting a lot and you got the resists.  She did charm my pet once (Necro) but thats it.  She wasn't as hard as these guys lead you to think.  We had the whole room and bridge area cleared though before she popped (did have to ST one add for a min or two).  If you break the room right and space out the repops, you will be fine.<br />
<br />
Good Luck.</div></div><hr />

Ok well i took your advice and bought the facemask for 25k on FV server, is that a pretty good price fora face plate like this?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>ThornyEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Considering it's a no-drop item for the rest of us not on FV, I have no idea. It seems about right, maybe a bit less, closer to 15-20k, if it was droppable. But with the bazaar the way it is these days, I'm not sure.</div></div><hr />
