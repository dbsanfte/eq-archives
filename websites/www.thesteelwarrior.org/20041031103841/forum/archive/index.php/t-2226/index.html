<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zakneffan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What do you guys think about Greatstaff of the four winds?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Greyslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'd like to get my hands on one that's what I know :).  Looks like an awesome weapon can't talk about agro though I don't have one maybe soon though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hyardgune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have one and use it constantly.  I bag it if I'm Defensive or raid MT.  I'll also bag it if I'm in a group with people who just pile on every aggro spell in the inventory.<br />
<br />
In general dps is very nice, aggro is acceptable for most xp groups.  I rarely need to taunt if I have a semi-capable shaman slowing.  I lose aggro to chanters doing tash + slow, but I often lose aggro to that with the GoT so it isn't a big deal.<br />
<br />
Pretty easy to get, provided you can find Auliffe up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wulfran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I love it and use it all the time. Only time I had aggro issues was when I was with a friend who was using Hategiver and CHSD... and if his haste dropped, my DPS aggro was enough that I was pulling past his hate procs. I honestly can't see anything replacing it before my guild can kill Rallos for a BoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zakneffan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I just got mine and I'm lovin it 8) pwnz in pvp Lol I beat my friend using emp 2hs with it !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It's a great weapon.  I use it always, including tanking defensive.  With PB3 it is amazing imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I wouldn't trust it for mt duty, but it rocks for dps situations. Hard to beat for the effort / risk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jedediah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Holds agro just fine for me, although I lack EB weapons.  I'd say it's at least equal in agro to my GBoS/CHSD combo, which I very much like to begin with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grendonbb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Holds agro just fine for me, although I lack EB weapons. I'd say it's at least equal in agro to my GBoS/CHSD combo, which I very much like to begin with. <br />
<br />
This is an exaggeration imo, or at the very least a bad analogy.  GBoS/CHSD combo is going to work much better with an enc slowing, or even a over zealous shaman, because with a single proc you are pretty much in shape to tank through tash/slow.  GSoT4W has great agro over time, because it is a very fast hard hitter.<br />
<br />
I find for endurance agro (in a longer fight), Greatstaff of the four winds is equal to my GBoS/CHSD combo, but when in exp groups with enc or bad shaman slowing, I find myself relying on taunt a little too much for my own liking.<br />
<br />
With that said however, in general exp groups and when not MTing on the raid, it is very rare to see this weapon out of my hands.  It is one of the best warrior dps weapons that I've ever seen pre elemental, and can hold its own with emp sword and seru sword.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Zakneffan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">well I mean there isn't different types or levels of aggro , you either have it or ya don't , and with Greatstaff of the four winds Ya have it so whats the difference...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zakneffan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">My bad on the last reply I stoped reading where it said ' I think this is an exageration'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I wouldn't trust it for mt duty <br />
<br />
It's my prefered weapon as MT.  It works better than most seem to give it credit for in that regard.  I rarely lose aggro once I've gotten a round or two in.  Sure an early proc would be more aggro at the start, but how often do you proc right at the begining?  As is, I don't lose aggro to slow usually anyway (even while def) with slow going in fairly early, and when I do, I get it back in one round without even taunting almost every time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jedediah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I stand by what I said :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Bloodheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Damn fine weapon for whatever you are using it for. This is pretty much common knowledge but definately get PB(1-3) if yer gonnna use a two hander, expands it's dps lots :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">nothing holds agro when any mob is debuffed right off unless its an extremely high proximity agro mob. DPS is going to get agro off a debuffer faster unless u get a lucky early proc. im sure the DW combo would gain agro faster overall, but it doesnt make much difference if you are slowing right off.<br />
<br />
honestly on several zones, we use a pally/sk MA, poa stuff hits too hard not to slow asap and remedy draws too much agro heh. unless you need defensive, knights are the way to go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Zakneffan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Pallys suck a$$ k thx . hands down end of story.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Wolveren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I prefer my Basalt Greatsword of the Protector because of the 40ac on it though agro seems a tad better on the staff, still use the staff in SolRo and PoF when I'm not tanking cause the dot from Greatsword won't land there.<br />
Just wish the staff didn't look so fragile. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Zakneffan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">dude imagine the ball at the end having the power of the winds huge force BOOM into your Gut , fragile , I think not , ok I'm tired and being stupid.</div></div><hr />
