I am hoping someone can offer me suggestions on what to upgrade my Ribcracker (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=28808) with.  I have about 60k to work with, and this is a weapon that goes in secondary.  I am hoping for somthing with more ac and hitpoints than current.  <br />

Thanks, <br />

Both are fairly inexpensive and will last a while because they have stun procs on them.</div></div><hr />

Copper Hammer is always a good place to start though</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">11-30-2004, 03:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">sorry guy but ribcraker is one of the weakest aggro weapon...<br />
both your weapon are weaker than Honed Blade of the Ykesha (troll smith) so basically you should pick up / buy the two first weapon you see with either a stun or an AC debuff.<br />
the traditional CHoS / SotB would be great for you untill you can get nice 1Hers (you have 2 reax slots so I assume you are a new recruit of a top guild or so. And I assume you are getting for now all the rotting stuff, right? so you can probably have much better weapon soon. But untill then you have to be decent and stop putting shame on us, warrior).<br />
and while you are at getting new armors, resell your royal att and augs for dual ykesha or dual A3 procs; and stop getting sturd untill SoE change its cost; and focus on WA as soon as you have changed your weapons.<br />
<br />
EDIT : actually, your DW combo is so weak that you should look after 2Her to get a cheaper but strong upgrade, get a GSoT (or maybe even a WMBS would be better) and you will do fine untill a rotting EoE or JOS or GBoS or ED or ...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Be cool to upgrade your arms with Armsmaster's or Raex ar whatever and use the LDoN points for AC and agro augs.  The stun aug from BF would also be a nice addition and its free.<br />
<br />
Although not part of your original question, I'd try to find some new bracers and a belt soonish.</div></div><hr />
