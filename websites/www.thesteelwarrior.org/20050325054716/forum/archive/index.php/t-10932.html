Is there any good tips / tricks ya'll would sugest to pl her up?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">03-14-2005, 04:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Besides running her through all the quests you can run her through, her best bet's gonna be to solo for exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iskandar</div><div class="date">03-15-2005, 04:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">not really; priests can't solo for shit for a while. getting her through quests will help a lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">corlathist</div><div class="date">03-15-2005, 07:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">WOW is much much harder to PL than Everquest.<br />
<br />
Since even if she hits it first, and does grey it out, if you do most of the damage she will only get a small fraction of the xp.<br />
<br />
About the only PL that works is via quests.   You should be able to knock out all the quests in an area each level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">recurse</div><div class="date">03-15-2005, 09:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Things we've tried:<br />
<br />
- grouping: we knew that the penalty would be bad, but we were unable to find any docs that tell us how close in level she needs to be to get exp (thats worth our time).<br />
<br />
- tag mob, me out of group: works okay, find a place with a very high density of mobs, and use something like a low refresh wand or instacast / low mana spell.<br />
<br />
- quests: mongo can push newbs through quests like mad, works pretty decent, only downside is either of the above killing methods gimp about half of the exp you would of picked up solo.<br />
<br />
- instanced zones: mobs yield alot of exp that will trickle down, even if you are grouped with the twink (it's not great, but it's not 0).</div></div><hr />

All of that sounds like work to me.  Probably be more fun and almost as efficient to just level up a new toon with her.</div></div><hr />

Bingo, make an alt rogue or something and lvl WITH her.<br />
<br />
Priests are tough to PL, if it was the other way around it would be 10x easier.  Just twink her with some gear, get her some summoned water from IF or a nearby friendly mage, and tell her to use Smite and spec shadow if she's soloing.  If you are lvling with her as a rogue or a dps class, she just needs to heal ya.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cotred</div><div class="date">03-17-2005, 08:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the best thing u cand do is make another char and go along with her...  and while she isnt playing then u use your main char..<br />
<br />
when you both reach you main char lvs then is up to you wich ur gonna use more..<br />
<br />
its my opinion..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">recurse</div><div class="date">03-17-2005, 11:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Quickest thing we've done so far was to push her to around 14ish and then start plowing through all the XR quests. Being able to do a level 20 quest at lvl 15 was 2-3k exp (I forget I wasn't watching her machine).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cyberfire2k4</div><div class="date">03-22-2005, 08:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">have her attack a mob that is still green to you (she has to be able to grey out the mob) then just kill it... she will get the full exp... just make sure the mob is not to high or she will not be able to do enough damage to grey the mob out...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greywing</div><div class="date">03-22-2005, 09:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">good idea to make alt to lvl w her.  Also don't forget that XP increases a lot if u rest awhile.</div></div><hr />
