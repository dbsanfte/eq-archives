<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Twalin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">ok so yeah this is my first post on this board but i have been playing a warrior for over a year my first character and also my main character.<br />
<br />
ok now to the issue at hand, all this class balance talk has really got me thinking what is it that makes people prefer knights in exp groups in PoP (since this is where most people agree balance became a problem) well the fact that most mobs hit very hard and very fast but have minimal hps makes slow important and the fact that slow makes the mobs spike damage much less it makes knights a much more viable tank, add this to their superior aggro generating capabilities and well bam there you have it, knights are more desirable than warriors for exp.<br />
<br />
the argument really has very little to do with hp/ac or mitigation and notice almost everyone will agree that warriors are superior in this area(how much superior is however) the only thing really affecting this problem at the time being i feel is itemization and yes it is really bad and has been for awhile<br />
<br />
so a fix? well 2 ideas... nerf the hell out of slow or remove it from the game entirely.... please tell me what is not broken about casting one spell and removing 75% of a mobs dps.... also note this spell is not that mana intensive or have that long of a cast time.  How to compensate classes that this is their main function? very simple actually increase shaman dps and maybe enchanters to a lesser degree (I have been in plenty of groups with both groups with both classes to know that enchanters will still be desired b/c of their utility)<br />
<br />
so any thoughts?<br />
<br />
oh and apologies if this has been posted already but have been reading here for quite some time and had not seen this issue brought up</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fruzuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It is too late to remove slow from the game. Too much of the game has been designed around slow.<br />
<br />
Slow is not the only thing that has screwed EQ up. Complete heal , defensive and slow have lead us to where we are today.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Marshall</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">How about decreasing the aggro generated by slow (and tash etc.), so that warriors can handle the situation better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'd say make it so that warriors can Tank mobs unslowed, as easily as hybrids tank them slowed.<br />
<br />
It fixes basically everything.<br />
We're not sick of the shaman slowing early, because we don't need the shaman to begin with. (though it makes it easier)<br />
We got our huge advantage in tanking, which we should have.<br />
Hybrids keep their unbeatable aggro, allowing wizards to dumbingly nuke.<br />
<br />
-Hybrids are loved for groups with shamans, though warriors can fill in there if no hybrids are available.<br />
-Warriors are loved for groups that have yet to be considered much, ones with no slower. (though ldon makes it available)<br />
<br />
Best solution for this?<br />
again... unlinking discs.. and allowing warriors to chain their defensive/evasive/any other new defensive type discs.<br />
Hardly changes anything on raids, except maybe not HAVING to wait 5mins for the maintank to be able to reuse disc.<br />
improves DRASTICALLY everything else about the warrior,<br />
and paladins are still preferred in groups with a slower, yay them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">wha? it's a bold idea in theory but jesus...warriors would mitigate/avoid 75% more damage than knights? hello trivial content. ^_^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Twalin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Fruzuk i am afraid you may be right but at this point im not so sure that changing something like this isnt almost necessary<br />
<br />
Marshall i dont really think that slow is all too much aggro really since if my CHSD procs once i usually dont lose aggro to slow and almost always get it with one taunt if i do....<br />
<br />
hmm bunnie i really dont know what to say about your idea although sounds good in theory but probably a bit overpowered  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I like what Bunnie Burner suggested there - reduce the agro from tash and slow.<br />
<br />
I think this could be taken further to have agro scale depending on how the mob con's to the caster.<br />
<br />
Mobs 4-5 levels blue (PoV mobs to a lvl 65) tash would be considerably less agro than to a lvl 65 even con mob, and a red con mob would react the same to tash as they do now so as to not take all the fun out of sacrificing a chanter at raids.<br />
<br />
By making this change we would leave the raid situation as it is while removing or atleast seriously reducing the need for it in XP groups.<br />
<br />
One of the best suggestions Ive read in a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Iskandar, we already do it. Except now it's plagued with ridiculous timers to avoid any overpowering.<br />
<br />
Having to switch between Evasive and Defensive sort of eliminates any overpowering aspect in raids... because usually, mobs that require defensive, would hurt you badly if you used evasive... and vice versa.<br />
<br />
Take Reparm, he seems pretty nasty, but defensive on him hardly does anything. So once your evasive is down, you're in trouble.<br />
<br />
Like I said, we already do it on raids... how could it trivialise content? Might make a few things a bit easier, only a few things though.... since paladins can easily tank 99% of the content anyhow.<br />
Scared that now we dont necessarily die when our discipline runs out?.... are Tank switches really that much a needed thing?<br />
They can still tweak up a few encounters (like they did in velious for caster resistance), and make it so that either evasive or defensive are rendered useless on the mob.<br />
That way... when our first discipline runs out, and we switch to the second type... we still have high chances of dying...<br />
making everyone happy.. not me though :p<br />
<br />
<br />
Groups?<br />
Well frankly.. defensive and evasive don't do THAT much on group type mobs.<br />
It will allow us to realistically tank unslowed mobs, that's about it...<br />
and at the same time it stops us from making any real damage.<br />
<br />
We have 0 spells, we're completely dependent on other classes... we can't do SQUAT alone...<br />
don't you think we should at least have SOME sort of REAL advantage?<br />
<br />
And I still fail to see how being able to switch between evasive/defensive indefinately, at the cost of seeing our dps reduced by a lot, can be overpowering in groups...<br />
Frankly... if a shaman or enchatner were free.. I'd still prefer taking the slower along with a hybrid, to allow my group Full Power dps.<br />
Instead of having a warrior with less then decent aggro, manage to tank an unslowed mob....<br />
<br />
Only difference for groups, Slowers lose their state of omnipresence. And that is a good thing.<br />
<br />
<br />
---------<br />
<br />
edit: Eoden, that wasnt my idea :p.<br />
And I personally dont like the idea of reducing tash/slow aggro, as a fix.<br />
Because it's not addressing us... we still suck..<br />
but the fix would make it so that other casters cant see how badly we suck?<br />
Once tash and slow aggro is reduced... how about reducing nuke aggro? so that paladins dont have a sick advantage on us..<br />
and heal aggro and rune aggro and ...........<br />
<br />
The warriors need a fix, im sick of seeing other classes tweaked to make way for the warrior's crap.<br />
How about a exp bonus? or extra ldon points for having a warrior?? That way we could get groups! we'de still suck ass, but who cares?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>landrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You are absolutely correct in you assesment as to the lynchpin of the problem being slow. <br />
<br />
Slow is needed in PoP.<br />
<br />
Slow Is Huge aggro.<br />
<br />
Slow kills chanter/shaman when the  tank looses aggro.<br />
<br />
But that is not the source of the problem. The source is much deeper and older. Changing slow will only minimize the problem for now.. until the next time when something else happens to bring the problem back into the light.<br />
<br />
the problem is that warriors are no longer the BEST tank in a MAJORITY of situations. <br />
<br />
You can say all you want about our better DPS, better Mitigation, both which have been reduced signifigantly in the last 4 expansions. But neither one of those abilities will make us the best tank in a MAJORITY of situations. The reason? Aggro. <br />
<br />
Much has been said about a 20k hp tank who cant hold aggro as being useless. The essence of that argument is essentially true. If the Tank cannot maintain the mobs attention, he is a useless tank.<br />
<br />
Sure we have been able to hold aggro before, and sure we 'can' do it now, but nowhere near as effective or as consistent as a Knight. <br />
<br />
The problem is with KNIGHT Tanks that its a 'no brainer' <br />
<br />
Little to no thought is needed when a Knight is the MT vs a Warrior<br />
<br />
There is a new generation of EQ players. No longer can you expect 90% of the people you meet to be 'Roleplayers' and be experienced in games such as D&amp;D. Now a majority of the players are PS2 kids.. They play for the fast action instant gratification. Having a Knight as a MT allows them to achieve that.<br />
<br />
Everyone who says we can hold aggro in Kunark... Velious.. Luclin... PoP.. you just suck as a warrior, whats wrong with you. Are either too egotistical or too proud to look around. Yes it 'IS' possible to hold aggro, but the likelyhood of losing aggro is greater  now than ever before.<br />
<br />
Essentially the whole problem comes to the fact that through 4 expansions, ALL casting/hybrid classes have seen their power level increase increadibly. More mana, more hps, more focus, more mana regen, more dps, more spells, more efficient spells, more gear, more AA's... more more more.<br />
<br />
And during that same time melee have gotten? more hps, more gear (of course 95% is usable by caster/hybrids), more AA's (melee AA's are shared with hybrids)<br />
<br />
The aggro-generating capacity of every class has increased, they do much more dps and detrimental spells than ever before. During that same time the aggro-holding capacity of Knights has also increased dramatically.<br />
<br />
Some say knight always had this advantage, partially true. However they did not ALWAYS have huge mana pools, and high mana regen abilities that essentially allow them to cast at a high rate for extended periods of time with virtually no down time at all.<br />
<br />
To compound this, the gap in tankability of Knights vs Warriors has decreased dramatically. in Velious what used to be a 1000 hp gap between  warriors and knights is still a 1000hp gap, even though the hp's of both have doubled. No matter what math you use, the gap has decreased, add to that the increase in knight skill caps to equal our own. Has made Knights virtually equivalent tanks as warriors.<br />
<br />
many things have contributed to the problem. Mobs that REQUIRE SLOW on INCOMMING only have brought it to light.<br />
<br />
Melee need extensive overhaul and upgrade to bring them up to the level of the casters/hybrids. <br />
<br />
Until that happens, we will continue to experience the same problems.<br />
<br />
IF/When we do get this upgrade, we need to STAY on the devs that no longer will every expansion ignore melee needs.. Or else they will be doomed to repeat their mistakes.</div></div><hr />
