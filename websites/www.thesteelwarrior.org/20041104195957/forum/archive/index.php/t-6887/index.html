<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tinuvil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You can roughly compare the proc with a Frostbringer aggrowise...<br />
<br />
Its not THAT bad - but any Stunproc would be better</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Seraz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">am i much better going with the GBoS or would the OSoW do me fine? it'll be anger 3'ed tho..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>GorfinML</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i recently replaced my anger2 auged CHOS with a OSoW(no anger yet).  with my CHSD+anger2 in my off hand, my aggro is roughly the same as with the CHOS....once i get aggro, its pretty solid and hard to lose, but not impossible..i'm sure with anger3(which i'm working on) would make it much better</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Seraz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">well if the OSoW(no anger aug) has the same aggro as a CHoS with anger 2 then that sounds pretty damn good to me especially when it's augged with anger 3, and plus it's got a increases proc rate of 25%, looks like ill be getting one of those  babies then! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>GorfinML</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i didnt mean to make it sound like ithas the same aggro<br />
<br />
a stun proc is diffently more aggro than obsidian shatter....add in anger 2, and its much more...<br />
<br />
but osow +anger 3 would prob be more aggro than chos+anger2</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Seraz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">got any idea how much aggro exactly it generates? like stun being 450?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>GorfinML</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">i think in another thread, obsidian shatter was said to be ~300 - 350<br />
<br />
with the better ratio, and the 25% proc rate increase, you might be able to assume the osow closes the gap in terms of aggro with the chos, and with anger 3, would surpass it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Neksnappa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I've had my OSoW for a while now, and would say it is comparable to a GBoS. As I've said before, if I get any combination of incite, obsidian shatter, anger2, or taunting blow, I can pull aggro off a slower. Since slow is right around 700 hate, and 2 obsidian shatter procs out-aggro it, I believe it to be right around 350-400 aggro. With WA4, it procs considerably more than my anger aug in it, due to the enhanced proc rate of obsidian shatter. If I got a GBoS tomorrow, and put in an anger2 aug, I would not mainhand it over the OSoW. Their procs are both enough hate, along with incite, to keep aggro when a mob is slowed, which is pretty much the only time I ever lose aggro. Since the OSoW has the increased proc rate, my odds of getting a proc on the first several rounds of melee is higher, which means the slowers are happier.<br />
<br />
Looking strictly at aggro-per-proc of OSoW, GBoS, and any Enraging blow weapon, the order is this: EB(700 hate), GBoS(400-450ish), OSoW(350-400). But without any WA, a GBoS procs twice per minute (mainhand) on average, for a total of 800-900 aggro. The OSoW procs 2.5 times per minute, for a total of 875-1000 aggro. OSoW &gt; GBoS in my opinion, go with what works for you though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Lessiter1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I bagged my offhanded GBoS for an offhanded obsidian scimi about a year ago.  With the 25% proc rate mod, it generates roughly the same agro as the GBoS, and it has considerably better stats and a better ratio.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Seraz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">kool, thanks guys im definately gonna start working on getting OSoW, it just looks so damn uber! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">it looks sweet and has cool stats .... it has a modified proc rate.  the aggro is somewhat less than a stun proc, but with incite, early procs are more important than stron procs.  i wouldnt ditch my GBoS for it, but i would glady pick one up if i lacked the GBoS</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Dozan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I have both an OSoW and a GBoS.  When I was using my BoC in primary (no longer have this though, returned it to guild when I got my BoW), I used my OSoW in secondary.  There are probably parses and scientific evidence that one is better than the other.  Honestly, I couldn't tell.  So either or is probably fine.  OSoW has better stats and ratio though /shrug.  That is why I went with the OSoW in my secondary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Omnus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I would go with the osow over gbos simply because I would prefer more chances for the proc. More often than not you just need one snap agro. Plus it has better stats. Although personally i think the osow looks horrible and I would not want one. The GboS would probably deal more damage as a mainhand weapon, and the osow prolly better off hand damage (not counting procs). <br />
<br />
2.5 procs per minute on a 350 agro, or 2 procs per minute on 450 agro. <br />
I would prefer more procs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">the lower amount of hate that it generates is offset by the increased proc rate which would put it about the same as GBoS for aggro, plus the stats are better on OSoW, id say go for whichever you could get first or like the look of more</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>zcao</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">&quot; 2.5 procs per minute on a 350 agro, or 2 procs per minute on 450 &quot;<br />
<br />
2.5 * 350 =875<br />
2*450 = 900<br />
<br />
So gbos is still better! plus obsidian scimitar of war has a really shitty proc, the aggro mostly come from the debuff, while great blade of storm is a stun proc that has good DD.  If you have no armor to upgrade, sure go ahead get the scimitar to try it out, but i think it is not worth the money while you can get gbos for cheap or already have it.  My opinion on pricing of the two could be wrong, i am on FV server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">GBoS and OSoW are both no drop on regular servers. And I personally dispute stun being 450 aggro, I think it's more like 400! The point is that they're close enough that it doesn't really matter over time, and the OSoW will get more early procs and therefore more reliable aggro than a GBoS. There isn't much difference in my opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Dags</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I use the GBoS and Osow combo anger augmented.  I dont have to much of an issue with agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Daabu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">When the hate values are so close together like they are (350, 450?), it seems like 3 procs will certainly be better than two, even if mathematically the hate per minute is slightly lower.  People have seemed to state that a Dual Wield combo has crappy aggro until the first proc.  First proc comes faster when you have a higher procrate (clearly).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">thats generally the same argument people use to advocate the BBotE over BoC</div></div><hr />
