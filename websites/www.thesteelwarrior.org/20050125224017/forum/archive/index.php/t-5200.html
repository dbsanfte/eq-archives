<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">01-14-2004, 10:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well courtesy of mudflation which causes weapons that used to be rare drops coveted by high level warriors to now be bazaar / twink trash there isnt really anything weapons farmable at your level that you are likely to want to use.  (I remember lvl60 warriors running round with dual Lammys, would you even twink with them these days?) <br />
<br />
That means you are going to need to save up to buy upgrades if you want them.  I recommend farming spiders / spiderlings for a few hours then selling silks in the bazaar to tradeskillers.  Once you've saved up a couple of hundred plat you should be able to afford a few decent 1 handers for your level - centi shortsword, jagged blade of mourning, lammentation etc all go pretty cheap these days.</div></div><hr />

If you were on my server, I'd give you a Lamentation.  Can't sell the darn thing, and since I actually farmed it myself I'd be heartbroken to sell to a vendor.</div></div><hr />
