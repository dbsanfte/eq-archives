<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>terminator24h</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was just looking at the epic quest guide over at Allakhazam and I realize that it's actually a fairly easy quest to do.  Everything is a pick up or easy kill except for the two dragon scales, the Hand of Maestro, and the Spiroc Windblade.  I can easily line up one group to take down the queen if necessary and I score a nice Incarnadine BP if the king is up as well.<br />
<br />
Given, my current weapon combo of CHoS + SotBS, is it worth it to complete my epic quest?  I'm in a raiding guild in which I could probably get a CHSD and a GBoS within a few weeks.<br />
<br />
Another consideration is the arrival of Epic v.2.0 which may drive up prices on MQ's of epic pieces and/or dragon scales necessary to complete the original epic.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />
<br />
Edit: I forgot to mention my magelo is located at http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=340202&amp;alt=233681 if there are any glaring problems with my equipment :D  Also, please have a look at the short-term goals - are those good upgrades which I have proposed?</div></div><hr />

Up to you man. these days tho Warrior Epic is just a status symbol compared to knowing that for ~ 20K ( price of a green scale on my old server ) you can have a weapon set ( greatstaff of thunder, copper hammer of striking, and a sword of the bloodsworn ) that will last you a LOT longer in usage than the epics would.<br />
<br />
but you still won't have your epics. they're dated weapons at best; a reminder of the days of old in EQ where their completion was something that set the world on end.</div></div><hr />

2 easy items you might consider as upgrades are Grand Pauldrons of Study and Loyalist Shield of Honor - Pauldrons I duo'd with a shaman in about 4 hrs, and Loyalist Shield took about 2(hardest part is getting named vamp to spawn), with me, druid, necro, mage.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
Actually, he loses 50 hitpoints. He gains 43 AC though. I'd trade 43 AC for 50 hps every day of the week, unless I was a lvl 1 woodelf with just the newbie shirt on, in which case losing 50 hps might make me dead.<br />
He'd also lose a bit of dex and some cold and fire resist, although there would be no law against him banking the old stuff in case he was not MT on some mob with nasty AOE cold damage. he'd gain 5 MR, which is marginal, but he can use it since he's at 70 MR right now.<br />
<br />
Eventually, he'll need more DEX and more hitpoints (if the Magelo is correct, and he made this change, he'd have about 1300 AC and 4200 hitpoints, which does seem a fairly high AC/hps ratio, not sure whether this is partly a function of him being agnostic or that it's very damn early in the morning my time and I can't think).<br />
Anyway, I don't know that he'd suffer greatly if he doesn't do these quests right away, but they would produce upgrades, and he did ask.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Brabble, what do you mean by a high AC/hps ratio?  I assume it means that I have a lot of AC given my HP... what's a more reasonable ratio if I'm off?  Oh and by the way, agnostic sucks.  I'd have so many upgrades for my cash which would be way more money efficient than anything I'm looking at buying right now.  Worst mistake I've made on this character so far is to make him agnostic, otherwise he's pretty perfect to me :p<br />
<br />
Thanks for all the replys everyone - I'm going to go keep my droga pair and go after a GBoS and CHSD.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Very well put. I still remember the first time I saw the warrior epic , in GFay. Very memorable. <br />
<br />
If you play EQ to min/max everything, don't do epic. If you simply want good agro weapons, don't do the epic. However, if you also enjoy some of the storylines and a nice sense of accomplishment, do it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, bleh, it was early. I was trying to ponder the fact that I was used to thinking aobut tribunal cultural armor, which is STA + hitpoint heavy and I'm now not actually sure you are &quot;off&quot; at all. Haven't spent as much time thinking about agnostic problems with gear.<br />
I'd suggest that some LDoN might be the next step. But probably first for anger augs, then armor. You'd pick up some dropped augments here and there, though.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Callon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The epic is only worth if it ends up being a signficant shortcut toward earning epic 2.0 when OoW comes out.  In and of itself, it's been a piece of utter crap for years.  I'd get no sense of accomplishment from it as the only thing challenging about any of the mobs is perhaps finding the green dragon up and not falling asleep while you clear to isle 6 in Sky.  I think you can do a turn in at permafrost now though to change another colored scale to green.  Not sure on that... haven't paid much attention.  Maybe someone else knows.  The fights are a joke.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Rorekil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I plan to finish my epic. Only a few parts from being finished. Reason 1 its a symbol type item as others have said, and reason 2, you never know what epic 2.0 might be like. So if ya have it and epic 2.0 turns out to be a useful item, you'd be that much closer to having it. Just my 2 copper, GL. :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Tamener</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Epic IS a prestige thing these days, and its quite sad if you consider warrior epic has 100 HP (2 1hs 50 HP each or 1 2hs 100 HP -- either way) and the zerker epic has 125.  Whats really sad is how difficult our epic is, compared to other classes epics and how ours is obsolete (ie clerics, zerkers, rangers, druid, shaman, etc..)  I have personally done Cleric, Zerker, Warrior, Shaman, Enchanter, Rogue, and Beastlord epics.  And put in a lot of help on mage, druid, and necro epics. And between the many years I have been playing I have prolly done quite a bit with every other classes epic.  Personally, I don't even think mages have it as bad as warriors (save one piece, aka PoSky Crown of Elemental Mastery),  but it depends on how well the 7th Isle likes you the day you go up.<br />

<br />
 Retnaburn,  just curious, how did you pick up Talisman of Vah Kerrath w/o access to VT or the Emp Key needed to complete the VT key?  Normally wouldn't ask but, the rest of your gear seams sort of odd around that piece and considering the other upgrades that would of been available to you in VT I would find it odd you chose to get that first.  I am guessing you were just playing with your profile and forgot to set it back =)  I myself am guilty of it from time to time =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Sirek Saron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Hehe I myself did 3 epics, and almost 4<br />
<br />
Rogue epic, a joke, half can be done in ONE day, after that, if luck is with you it's the end, if not, you need to get the robes.<br />
<br />
Paladin epic, kinda useless (althought I like the stun proc), but fun, and not really easy.<br />
<br />
Monk Epic, not hard, just many many camps, but a great weapon considering you have nothing pre-EP to upgrade the hands slot.<br />
<br />
Warrior epic, almost ended (missing chardok and PoF only), not that hard, in fact, just need a gooood focus, green and red scales can be done with raid (if mobs are up yes =/), Posky is just a camp, as you can chain-pop the spiroc lord, Hand of the maestro is a joke, mountain giant patriarch too (camped him 2 time, got 2 monocles, less than 2h camp each time), chardok is just a little more hard because many high end player work on faction, and PoF is: go back in the DTers.<br />
<br />
Anyway i heard green scale drops in SolC, was that right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kiya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Heh.  I still wield my red epic when I dual wield.  Not the best offhander, I know.  I have had absolutely zero luck on seeing anything like a CHSD, GBOS or BoC drop, but not for a lack of trying!  (That and someone wanting me to pay 400k for a BoC can kiss my butt.)  I picked up my epic bits piece by piece on raids when working on epics for other guildmates.  It was a slow process, taking the better part of 2 years.  If you are hoping this will be the end all and be all of aggro, you are setting yourself up for dissappointment.  <br />
<br />
Short answer: If you want it for prestige, go for it.  If you want it for aggro, stick to the droga combo or a GSoT.<br />
<br />
That being said, a few ideas on armor.  You did not mention your budget.<br />
Pants: Fine Heraldic, EF LDoN plate, Hardened Serpent Scale Greaves (Riwwi), ornate<br />
Shoulders: Strength of the elements, Draconic pauldrons, Grand pauldron of study<br />
Range: Blindeye (Riwwi) would be nice on hps, AND take away your night blindness without having to switich out for a bow.<br />
Wrists: Fine Heraldic, Mana threaded bone bracer<br />
Arms: Fine Heraldic, EF LDoN plate, ornate<br />
Ear: all sorts of nice stuff to be found, better ones would be Bloodmetal Earring, another mosquito leg or maybe a rotting iksar claw<br />
Helm: LDoN plate helm or ornate would be best<br />
<br />
Well, just a few ideas I got with a once over on your real magelo.   ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Saeborne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Varalla, how do you have two red swords?  That looks WAAAAAAAY better than a red/blue combo.<br />
<br />
I realize that it's actually a fairly easy quest to do.<br />
<br />
I have to dissagree on this point.  I thought this quest was a HUGE pain in the ass.  Sure, none of the mobs are all that difficult by today's standards, but the aggrivation factor is HUGE!!!  Camping the green dragon?  Countless public Fear raids to see IF the golems are up, and even IF they are, IF they drop the Golem Balls.  Sure, Isle 6 of PoSky is not difficult, but that can be a 5 hour raid, because certain Island bosses don't spawn until after a fixed amount of time.  Corpse summoning to isle 6?  Any time saved is out weighed by the enormous pain-in-the-ass factor.  The quest to change colors of the dragon scales is also a pain.  <br />
<br />
I'm not trying to dissuade the original poster.  If you truly want the light sabres, go afer them.<br />
But please understand that this quest comes with a ton of aggrivation.<br />
<br />
Personally, I still off-hand the red light sabre, for 3 reasons:<br />
1)  Comprable aggro to off handing the SotBS.<br />
2)  I really like the way it looks.<br />
3)  I worked SOOO hard to get that fooking thing!!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">These days, dragon scales and spiroc wingblades are fairly inexpensive in the bazaar.  They'll still cost you more than a CHOS/SOTBS combo, but perhaps not by too much.  Fear golem balls are generally available for MQ for a small price since they are so common.  The queen blade is the only real stickler in the quest, since you can't multiquest it, and you can't buy it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Quarg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">pretty sure that to get 2 reds you aug one, then use the mage-sword trick in the scabbard to make another</div></div><hr />

I won it at a Stormhammer GM event. My best item and I can't aug it. =p<br />

Varalla, how do you have two red swords? That looks WAAAAAAAY better than a red/blue combo. I posted how here: http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=7416. Scroll down to my post. It requires you to have the original items you received from the quest (the un-augmentable weapon/s and the scabbard).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I didn't know Spiroc Wingblades can be bought in bazaar? And if you can get it in bazaar good luck on getting one. Nowadays noone likes to go up to PoSky.<br />
<br />
Anyways, if you can get it, why not do it? If its fun for you then do it. Play to have fun  :p</div></div><hr />

&lt;Rashere&gt; The original epics are not required in order to do the quests for the new ones, but possessing one of the original epics will allow you to skip some of the earlier steps.&quot;<br />

No, a red epic will not generate anywhere near the aggro of a chos. &quot;feels like it does&quot; is crap. Parse it, read the thousands of posts pertaining to it.<br />
<br />
And taking 2 hours to get zefer to spawn for the loyalist cloak/shield is amazingly lucky. Don't show up at the castle expecting to get him your first camp session. Or your second. Or before SolRo freezes over.<br />
<br />
IMO, if I hadnt MQed my wingblade months ago, I'd probably do the epic just to get it done and make the epic1.5 that much easier to get. As it is, getting a raid together to do whatever I have to in OoW for the new epic is probably easier than getting people to raid oldschool, worthless mobs.</div></div><hr />

The only thing that shows up using the parameters &quot;epic&quot; and &quot;parse&quot; is this thread, and &quot;epic&quot; and &quot;chos&quot; brings up alot of conflicting opinions. Maybe you can tell us what to search for, or link the thousands of threads you're talking about.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When I asked  the question earlier, I was told that the Red Epic in off hand will generate similar aggro to a SotB...  No one said it was equal to main handing a CHoS.<br />
<br />
At anyrate, I tried the mage sword in the red scabbard trick yesterday, and it appears it does not work anymore.  And to be clear, yes, I have the original epics + scabbard pre-LDoN.</div></div><hr />
