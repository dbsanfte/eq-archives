<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">11-10-2003, 01:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A number of people have posted on these boards that PoP mudflation is entirely responsible for Paladins being able to tank like Warriors and cast spells with near abandon.<br />
<br />
Actually, it can happen whenever there is enough Plate/All items with mana, FT and focus effects in a tier.<br />
<br />
While these are probably not well constructed (I don't know Magelo good enough) take a look at what was possible pre-PoP, no AA's, and at level 62.<br />
<br />
Warrior - Lucky Dogg - 5512HP 1575AC<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=853928<br />
<br />
Paladin - VeryLucky Dogg - 4904HP 1568AC 4608Mana and nice FT<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=853934<br />
<br />
No matter how much a Warrior raids and farms, nothing will give him aggo control as good as a Knight.<br />
<br />
Knights CAN have very nearly Warrior HP and AC while having powerful spells and plenty of mana. The gear is out there.<br />
<br />
With LDoN, even a non-raiding Knight can can purchase with Adventure Points and at the bazaar sufficient equipment  to be a powerful tank and a powerful caster. 69AC BP's, 48AC Legs, FT augments, Narandi's Helm, Earring of Solstice, Jurglash's Legacy, Spiritmaster War Beads, AoTC, and KIE will do the job nicely.<br />
<br />
I agree that SoE shouldn't make radical changes based just on PoTime mobs.<br />
<br />
But even at lower raid tiers and using LDoN:<br />
<br />
Warrior = survivability + aggro control<br />
<br />
Paladin = near equal survivability + suprior aggro control + spells + mana + mana regen<br />
<br />
I don't advocate a nerf. But let's not try to pretend there isn't any class imbalance. Now, without a nerf, give all Warriors aggro control up the the standard set by Knights and real (not more inferior pseudo-spells) compensation for not having a spellbook.<br />
