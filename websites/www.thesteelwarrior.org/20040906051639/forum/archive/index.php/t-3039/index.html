<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wumamdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all,<br />
<br />
New to this board.  Trying to see if anyone in the game is geting a download of 23 hours? Bought LDoN online today.  Went smooth till I logged on for the 2nd time.  What I'm looking at now is a 23 hour donwload.  Is this all due to LDoN? If so, can I just buy CD in the store and DL files I need straight from CD? I know I would pay double, but I can't tie up phone line for 23 hours.  And a cable modem is not in my budget! :) <br />
<br />
<br />
Thx<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">yeah the CD version should be in stores now try EB or Best buy they might have it.  I know you can order the CD version from www.ebgames.com not sure if they have it at the store</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Merkell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah do that it will save you 2 and a half hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">What kind of connection do you have?  I downloaded LDoN on my 2nd computer in 30 minutes.  You might just want to try it at another time because it shouldn't take that long.  Maybe the server was bogged down or something.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Brutal, was that a fresh download?  By fresh I mean you didn't download the mini-patches every time you logged in previous to the date LDoN went Live?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>OlavSkulcrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hmm, would that CD maybe save me from having to download 7 months worth of patches just to run the game at all? Dial up is the sux. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">well I have to do a complete reinstall of EQ and XP caused I got haxxored. I couldnt weed out the corrupted files and Norton only found a few.  So tommorow is the day I will do this (luckily I like doing this stuff call me a geek I find it fun).  Luckily I got a cable modem so the complete patch should only last about and hour or a half.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I suggest doing it overnight for a few nights.  Would be quicker than ordering it offline and easier than leaving the house to go buy it, two birds with one stone!  :D <br />

Yea, I had pre-downloaded on my main comp but not the 2nd one.  Main computer didn't have to patch more than a minute.  2nd one took 31 minutes to download everything.  I have cable though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Thalzaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I just did a re-install on my 2nd comp and it took me ~50 min to download all the patches and updates, LoY and LDoN on DSL.</div></div><hr />

Plus, one expansion is 20 bucks, high speed is 20+ more every month. Please tell me this doesnt really boggle you.</div></div><hr />

Heck, I'm just happy to have any internet access at all.<br />
