<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KnomeEatter</div><div class="date">08-13-2003, 07:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I'll start with the basics.  I just returned from a rather lengthy EQ vacation, probably about year total in the past year and a half.  Before I left I played a level 55 Troll Warrior and posted on the old Steel Warrior board.  I sold the character to my father because I needed money (and he sadly hasn't left Bazaar for anything but 1 flag, I forget what).<br />
<br />
Now, after tinkering with a bard and not liking it, I remade as another Troll Warrior.  I'm level 25 (Verant made it too easy, still have 13 of my newbie food left) now and have no idea where to hunt.<br />
<br />

<br />
I have an Ikky BP to regen with.  And yeah, all that stuff except the Lammy is off a Human bard so it's not as great as it could be, it's all I could do with what I had.  I have some Halas 10lb meat pies in the bank for when I finish my newbie food.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions on where to hunt?<br />
<br />
I hate HHK, too many morons.  I was soloing in Mistmoore but it was slow.  I don't really like outdoor zones, so if you can suggest a dungeon type atmosphere that would be great.  I'd go to an outdoor area though, as long as it's not for too long.<br />
<br />
Also, are there any places to make decent plat at this level?  I know HHK guards can drop a fair share, and plan on killing those around 30.<br />
<br />
Sorry for such a long post, and thanks for the help.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Personally I would duo with a druid of about same level and fear kite cougars in Iceclad.  Great thing is you can bind right there too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">booyaki</div><div class="date">08-13-2003, 10:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can always try Splitpaw, pretty good with the xp bonus, and you should be ok with the regen bp, but if u brought along a similiar lvl healer you could be raking in the xp.   Also, each gnoll drops around 2-3 pp so, you could get decent money while you're there.  <br />
<br />
hope that helps</div></div><hr />

<br />
took a good group in there not too long ago, all around lvl 25...<br />
<br />
2 rogues, 2 necros, 1 cleric heh<br />
<br />
the rogues had fun because whoever had agro, the other got to BS, so they just swapped off.<br />
<br />
I have also duoed in dalnir, two necros can lay down some serious DPS with dot stacking.<br />
<br />
Just if you go to Dalnir, you MUST have someone to snare, either a necro with darkness or a druid/ranger with snare, runners will get you dead in a hurry.</div></div><hr />
