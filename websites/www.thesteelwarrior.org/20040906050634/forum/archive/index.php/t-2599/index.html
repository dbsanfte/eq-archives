<br />
Last month if I recall correctly we averaged just shy of 300,000 hits per day here, and our cost is significantly less.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wychway</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The ranger posts were amusing. Like 'we all rode the shortbus over' amusing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Soupy is a fucktard.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Oh and if you want the truth - Soupy wasnt banned from the Crucible for disagreeing with Sunmoon. He was banned IIRC because he kept posting the same thread over and over again until the moderators were forced to ban him. Then he made new user names and continued to do it. I suspect he's also one of the people who keeps making up user names and posting the same stupid question threads 3 times a day also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Wulfran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">There weren't some bad flames but I mean wtf? <br />
<br />
OK, I'm a little biased in that I do know Sunmoon and meet up with him in game on occasion and he's not a bad guy. Can't the SKs get over the fact that they have their own boards away from his Ranger ones? I mean its been a year+... get over it. Be proud that they have their own boards that are thriving and move on.<br />
<br />
As far as the engagement ring thing, well, its not something I would have done but thats his business not mine. He says his finace/wife knows about it and was OK with it so... who cares?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Sunmoon is a fuckin scammer, plain and simple.<br />
<br />
2000 dollars every 6 months for hosting?  and he's not on fuckin ezboard?  He's the biggest crock of shit the EQ community has ever seen.  That doesn't even include that fuckin wedding ring scam..holy shit.   Any woman that is okay with you TAKING FUCKIN DONATIONS to buy her a wedding ring isn't worth marrying.  Jesus christ, have some fuckin self respect.  My wife wears a fuckin silver band because it's what I could afford at the time, and she's perfectly happy with it.<br />
<br />
I've been banned from the crucible a couple of times now because I called him on his bullshit....it's not really a huge loss tho because the crucible is easily less useful than the fuckin druid's grove these days.<br />
<br />
It's just too bad that everyone else is so busy slobbing his internet knob to notice that he's pulling the wool over their eyes.  Wanna know why no one donates to his site?  Because he lacks the ethics to be responsible with people's money.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The funny thing is that he ADMITS he buys beer and jewerly with the money.....I have NO idea why people would pay for that when most could use the money themselves :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">10 pages into it I had to quit. There was some pretty good stuff mixed in with the trash. Nothing great, but some worth a read.<br />

Call us sheep again and I'll fucking hunt you down IRL and fucking dump your garbage can out all over your driveway you dumbass. <br />

I could just see this nimrod beating his chest and flailing his arms inbetween smaking the keyboard.</div></div><hr />
