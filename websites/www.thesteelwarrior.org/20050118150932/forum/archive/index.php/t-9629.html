<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Guy</div><div class="date">11-04-2004, 03:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Friend of mine from a while ago is leaving his bank account to me, which consists of about 300k, give or take. I'm kind of at a loss as to where I should upgrade. I've been using the droga combo for a while now, but when we're raiding it doesn't do me much good because the copper hammer has push and is forbidden on our raids. Should I go for weapons or armor? BoC is clocking in at around 200k on my server these days, but SoMV, BBC and MoM are all around 50-80k depending on who is selling. Have also seen some HoRZ, boot of the storm/bloodied boots of dark rights, and horn spiked shoulder plates around. My guild is currently broken into the elementals but won't start raiding until we can get more people to finish up their flags. Any suggestions are appreciated.<br />

Since you're in eplanes I'd particularly recommend the BoC unless you're expecting to see a SEWS/BoW soon. <br />
<br />
You could also look at buying crystallized acid bracer and a mana-threaded bone bracer. I'd try to replace that jagged bone hoop, too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
HoRZ and BoC are good investments because you can always resell them.  If you could get both of them for your cash i would do that.  Perhaps you could snag another bloodmetal earring as well.<br />
<br />
Lots of potential things to buy ... my suggestion is make a map of upgrade potentials and see what gives you the best bang for your buck.  Remember, though, that you can't resell anything attunable, so buying alternative droppable things might be optimal.</div></div><hr />
