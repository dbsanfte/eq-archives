<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Talena Waterflower</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Does anyone know of a good list with accurate Skill Caps and levels?  I looked at Casters Realm but that is obviously out of date.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Level 65:<br />
<br />
1hb, 1hs, 2hb, 2hs - 250<br />
offense, defense - 252<br />
piercing - 240<br />
riposte - 225<br />
dodge - 190<br />
bash - 200<br />
archery - 240<br />
parry - 230<br />
dodge - 190<br />
kick - 210<br />
double attack - 245<br />
duel wield - 245<br />
<br />
For level 1-39 it's: 5 * Your level + 5<br />
Once you hit level 51 your skills start going up again, usually at 2 or 3 per level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cuclain MacLlir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Bash is higher than that, 230 iirc, but it caps higher than kick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Talena Waterflower</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ahh the 2 or 3 a lvl was what was confusing me, guess I am pretty close to capped then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Squizer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Slam-Bash: 240<br />
H2H: 100</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I kept a warrior at lvl 52 for quite some time to fight Vox/Naggy. I'm pretty sure the numbers below are capped for that level:<br />
<br />
1HS--210<br />
1HB--210<br />
bash--208<br />
defense--220<br />
dodge--150<br />
double attack--213<br />
D. wield--218<br />
offense--220<br />
parry--206<br />
riposte--206<br />
taunt --206<br />
<br />
Not sure, but i think 2HB &amp; 2HS are the same as the 1HS &amp; 1HB.<br />
Also not sure but I think bind wound caps at 183 at lvl 52.<br />
My throwing skill at level 52 was 32. Quite certain that's *not* the cap, lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bedan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Talena,<br />
<br />
I think this is what you are after. I cut and pasted it from an earlier thread. I hope this answers your question.<br />
<br />
Bedan<br />
<br />
A few notes before I get to the numbers. I will list the skill name and then nine or ten values after each. The first value represents the max skill you can have at 51st level. The second value represents the max skill you can have at 52nd and so on. All skills reach class max at 60th but there are a few that max at 59th and some even earlier. You of course can still increase skills that are not at the class max beyond 60th but if you max your skills at each level like I did you will not be gaining any additional skill-ups after 60th. Maybe the new expansion will allow higher skill caps. Here's hoping.<br />
<br />
For me Hand to Hand (100), Disarm (200) and Swim (200) all max'd out at or before level 51. As I stated earlier I did not really start tracking it until then so I'm not certain at what level these three skills can be max'd. Also a few of the bind wound scores below are estimates (183, 187 and 195). It was the only skill that I struggled to max at each level before advancing. Other then those three scores I believe everything else is right on.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Xarilok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The Bind Wound Values are off.  You max at 200 before 51.<br />
<br />
Then it goes 202, 204, 206, 208, 210.  With 210 being reached at level 55.<br />
<br />
Also, going from 200 to 201 skill alters the amount you BW for by a LARGE amount, somewhere close to doubling it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Higher soon. ^_^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">My numbers at 52 are exactly the same as Baden's. Strangely enough, our Bw numbers at lvl 52 match at 183.<br />
If Xarilok got his warrior's Bw to 200 before lvl 51 I'd believe him, but also even if you BW a lot I wouldn't be shocked if you don't cap the skill. My Vox/Naggy warrior was 52 for four months and in the first couple weeks he went from 179 in BW to 183 and then spent 3 1/2 months at 183 despite running through many many backpacks of bandages. I should note, however, that his WIS was sub-100, so if gaining skill is based on the best of WIS/INT then you can run for a while with no skill ups in something like that.<br />
The RNG is the debil.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Talena Waterflower</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Awesome!  That was exactly what I was hoping for!  Thanks!<br />
<br />
I really need to work on a few, bind wound for one, and archery/bash.<br />
<br />
How do you manage to get bash so high?  do I pretend I am a pally for a while while groping? or just &quot;help&quot; another group for awhile?<br />
<br />
Glad I have a mage to summon backpacks of bandages/arrows hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Slam = bash for large races, so no need for Ruatha bashing.<br />
But, kick stuns too eventually, so if you're a small race I wouldn't sweat it (I haven't played a small race war, though).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>heymu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I am a lv65 war..<br />
and My Pierce skill is 248 now<br />
Because when I tank POV Golem and low HP , I change The Horn of Hsagra for more AC ...<br />
then ..... I see my 1hp skill up message .... <br />
SOE make Pierce skill cap the same with other weapon now ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Xarilok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Yes, Piercing caps at the same as other skills now, for warriors and for beastlords both.  Someone said on steelwarrior that piercing capped at 250 while others went to 270 at 70, I have a hard time believing that, due to the fact that I heard similar things about BLs that were also wrong...IE, someone said BLs got H2H to 270 and 1HP/1HB/2HB were raised to 250, but they were not, they all cap at the same now, I would only think they did the same for warriors too.</div></div><hr />
