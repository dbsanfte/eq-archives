Out of the way spot so there's rarely anyone there too.  Katta Castellum is right next door if you can sell there, or the Vah Shir fort in Grimling Forest isn't too far if you're not so friendly with the Combine.<br />
<br />
As a 67 warrior you could put on your DPS set-up and easily clear both caves.  Just doing the west cave (I'm lazy) I net about 250-400pp per hour in vendor loot (gems and runes) and 4-10 bricks of acrylia.  No cash drops there but the acrylia runes add up pretty fast plus the weapons they drop sell for 4-6pp each.  Just bring lots of bags with you, the more bags the greater the profit.<br />
<br />
If you are waiting for respawns the wandering alien mobs (Gor Taku, Cral Ligi, Meeda Hune) also drop gems, acrylia and essence of wind.  The weapons they drop (spiny) aren't worth carrying out though.<br />
<br />
I'm sure you could do a lot better with player tradeable stuff but if you just want some quick cash with little hassle it's an idea.</div></div><hr />

I sell them easily for 50p a piece but I guess that just depends on if there's alot of people tradeskilling at the time. Usually not a problem on Bertox for me.</div></div><hr />

I can clear all of the general guards, go into the hidden tunnles in the paladin guild, kill all of them, get back to zone in and Heal myself back to full before next spawn. 20-30minute respawn, i make a good 300pp per spawn cycle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Atkins</div><div class="date">12-08-2004, 02:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Probably Quicker to level a necro as a farmer.  My necro (main toon) is 67 and I have my warr alt that is a lot of fun to play.  Necro has just become my cash cow.  A 59 necro can make more pp than a 70 SOLO warr can kill for.  Have necro solo nobles causeway, vxed, natimbi, veksar, yada yada pretty much any friggin zone and sell the loots: slugworms, discordant scoria, trean flies, soulscream belts, highly polished gems in POV, the list goes on forever pretty much.  Necros will do these feats with shit gear, and 2300 unbuffed hps.  Warriors were not made to make money SOLO Im not talkinc 2 boxing or 6 boxing, SOLO.  My 54 warr is well equipped thanks to my necro.  Bottom line, You wanna race to 1million banked pp after being fully geared SOLO as a warr, make a necro.  You wanna tank x uber mob make a warr, thats just how it is.  I, myself like a little of both.  Warr and necro on the same account works for me :) Leveling a necro to 65+ SOLO, is not too tough or time consuming if you know the game, they make a great ALT or main to a warr toon.  I feel sorry for the warriors needing to kill giants and shit for pp, that just saddens me.  Erase your level 26 druid or ranger and roll a necro you got 8 toon slots per account for christ sake, and hey you learn a lot about aggro gain/loss/hold by knowing warr and necro.  Im sure some may agree.  <br />

<br />
My suggestion is always this : Highkeep. As a 55 warrior I was able to make 300-600pp an hour. This of course depends on whether anyone else is in there with you. You can kill guards that drop up to 6pp and always a fine steel weapon. You can also kill nobles at level 65 NP; they drop gems ringmail and such. <br />
<br />
Anyway you mentioned you wanted to rampage something. I think you could easily do that there. The only problem I see is the pathing would mess it up, all the stairs and such. Ive thought about going there and trying to clear everything (Goblins, Nobles, Guards) with just furious. One full clear of that zone would easily get you way over 500pp.</div></div><hr />

  I used to do this too for a while, but sometime recent, the guards in the back zone became such that they cannot be attacked.  Used to sweep the 8 or so up front, then hit the 6 in back, but now the back zone is different.  You notice this too?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ichkabibel2</div><div class="date">12-09-2004, 02:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i dunno about your guys' server but on drinal flawless rockhopper hides sell for about 300pp each, superb for like 150.  the rockhopper caves in DSP are a really good farming spot if not too many people are xping there.<br />
<br />
also, spider silk farming in east K / upper guk is very easy and can get alot more money than you can farming plat drops off guards and stuff imo.  same goes with othmir fur farming in cobalt scar, tradeskillers pay 150-200pp each and they're pretty common.<br />
<br />
<br />
look around in bazaar to see what this stuff sells for first, it might be a whole lot less depending on how many people farm it for selling.</div></div><hr />

LoY zones are pretty good.  Dulak is decent if you can handle it.  If you get a partner (preferably some sort of healer), hit up Hate's Fury, I found the cash there to be worthwhile, plus random drops from nameds can be turned in for tribute or sold for petty cash.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grumbam</div><div class="date">12-10-2004, 09:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Go to Sanctus Seru<br />
<br />
Go to the second level (upstairs area) on the outer wall.<br />
<br />
You can go around in a big circle killing the green guards for 15-35 pp each + vendor loot gems occasionally.<br />
<br />
I'd reccomend doing this while your mind is occupied on some lengthly distracting task so that you don't get so board you want to shove a spoon forcebly up your own ass.<br />
<br />
Watching all 3 LoTR movies back-to-back is a good chioce.</div></div><hr />

shove...a spoon..FORCIBLY...up your own ass...<br />
<br />
jhc.  what is the world coming to?<br />
<br />
anyway...not to derail...but  the Ice Giants outside Permafrost Keep are a good source for plat and vendor loot as well.  only three giants and they're on i think a five minute timer.  not *too* much downtime, and no PH.<br />
<br />
another suggestion is crystal caverns.  if you get on the city faction there you can sell the gems off the geonids.  can also get ore off the orc miners which can be sold in bazaar for around 50pp each.  then there's also the named drops you can sell in baz or even not bad selling just to the vendor.<br />
<br />
but really.  the best advice is don't solo -- get in a WoS group.  the item drops there (runes if all the casters have already gotten one) will yield FAR more plat/hour than any soloing would.  plus you get exp there too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I disagree and here's why:<br />
<br />
If your aim is to farm plat, and you do it in a WoS exp group.....<br />
<br />
1. the 5 or so runes/loots from the named that would drop in a typical 4 hour session will be rolled on by everyone weather they need them or not. Expect to get 1 ...these can still fetch decent prices, but saturation has made them difficult to sell (on my server at least, there are 8-12 of every possible droppable or attunable item from WoS on sale in the bazaar at all times)<br />
<br />
2. I Guaranfuckingtee there will be a tradeskill assclown in your group who will demand any tradskill items that drop. (omg! HI! I have 280 skill in every tradeskill, I'll take those things k?) if you protest, he'll promise to make all of the others in the group (except you)  +5 Vorpal Asswhackers and you'll be outvoted.<br />
<br />
3. Any droppable quest pieces you might aqquire will be gobbled up by necros who have ally Children of Dranik faction that they managed to solo running a macro while they were at their pillates class. If you offer to roll on them they'll tell you how that item is needed for their &quot;Robe of Involuntary Sodomy&quot; and it should be NBG.<br />
<br />
So you might stand to come away with 475pp worth of loose cash and an edge of enveolpment you can put up for sale in the bazaar with the other 14 or so that are already there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Riggor</div><div class="date">12-10-2004, 02:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dunno you can make a decent amount of money soloing in Dranik scar. And get the Dronik loyalist faction, and aug drops. <br />
<br />
If your really lucky the Gem of the chosen ones will drop for you. You will need buffs, resists, and regen if you want to solo non stop. <br />
<br />
Mobs proc about 410+ kyv's proc the most. Its not big raw pp, but gems drop often and you can sell augs for 1k at least. Get one of your friends to cut it to 12 for stats, they make great twink items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hildarm Iceblade</div><div class="date">12-10-2004, 02:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">LOL, OMG LOL.  Even more funny cause I've seen shit like this with my own eyes.<br />
<br />
My 2cp:  Highhold Keep, Ice Giants outside of Permafrost Keep, or being quick with those rare Bazaar deals and re-selling.  I aim to try that Sanctus Seru idea though [minus the 3 LoTR movies, I'd rather watch them fully.]</div></div><hr />

<br />
well to each their own i guess.  I have had no problem whatsoever getting items/runes in WoS OR selling them in the baz, for that matter.  Never ever had a &quot;tradeskill asshole&quot;.  Never had touble with quest pieces.  Guess I am a rare exception that gets good groups in WoS and has the patience to play the baz...</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Fishing Supplies Vendor in Dulak is possible to sneak/sell to. So bag space not an issue if you can sneak. I wonder if you can sneak if you only have a Vah Shir illusion?<br />
<br />
Also, Acylia Caverns is a bit harder than the Grimlings in TM, but they drop weapons that sell for 142p each.</div></div><hr />

Whack him, loot his pouch. It's the &quot;rare&quot; part of the rallic pack quest. You'll have to hit up the owlbear cave and get some shade silk, but the pack is nice.<br />
It's also lore, but you can have the pack and loot another pouch. <br />
Used to sell my extras for 850 pp (those I didn't give away to guildmates/alts).</div></div><hr />
