<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nord</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've seen a number of warriors using what looks like a velium swiftblade in their secondary (and more often than not, one of the Droga weapons in the primary).  Would it be worth it to put some form of aggro proc aug on the swiftblade?  Or would it be better to give up the haste for a different weapon entirely?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">they prob are using a katana of pain and not a velium swiftblade :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">it's okay; especially if said warrior is one of the smaller races fresh into or out of ToVN; 99% of the time it's a katana of pain<br />
<br />
why it's so nice for us? +50 stamina on it. teh suck about it is that it's negative 10 to all resists.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yea, if you see someone with a Jaelen's equipped these days, it probably means they're ebayed or they quit in velious and just came back to the game hehe.  Probably not more than 10 of those things per server or so, and most of the people that have them wouldn't use them these days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">shame, too, Verant did a wonderful job with that weapon model - it even has an accurate hamon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I sometimes used an Acryla Handled Broadsword main and Jalean's offhand to recover HP's after slowing with a ToD when soloing. The lifetaps double with Critical Spell Blasts.<br />
<br />
I then decided fear kiting (Polished Obsidean Great Axe and Silken Whip of Ensnaring) cut down my exposure to damage and the lifetap weapons let me recover any lost HP's<br />
<br />
Finally I learned that with decent regen it made more sence to slow the mob and kill it as fast as possible pulling out the lifetap weapons when it walked away.<br />
<br />
It's a shame really that 1Hdrs do such low damage in PoP and make you catch more repostes. I wouldn't mind using them when doing general melee.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Serameth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I use jaelen's in my offhand with BoC.  may not be much aggro but it procs tons<br />
<br />
Oh, I got mine from the 3rd Ring of Vulak victory, so its very possible some people may have it.  RoV is a fun and still a challenging encounter.  One of the few they did correctly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Crystara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">AHBS is a small whitish sword, Render from cursed is what has the same graphic as Bloodfrenzy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Deadalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">As far as I recall, the way to make a japanese sword so it's both hard to break AND sharp was to combine two types of steel.<br />
<br />
See, steel grades vary based on carbon content. Low carbon steel is difficult to break and flexible, making blades made from it sure not to break when struck with other blades in combat. However, the flexibility means a sword made from it won't hold an edge and will go dull fast. High carbon steel, on the other hand, is hard and will hold a sharp edge very well, but is brittle.<br />
<br />
What the japanese swordsmith would do would be combine the two types when making a blade. The japanese sword is, simply put, a high-carbon, hard steel core wrapped inside a low-carbon, flexible steel jacket. Wrapped on 3 sides, of course; 1 side has to be exposed to form an edge which would be sharpened. A sword like this was strong, flexible, and difficult to dull.<br />
<br />
The hamon is where you can see the two metals meet; it's a line that runs down the sides of the sword and marks the point at which the hard core peeks out from under the soft steel jacket. It becomes prominent and easy to see during the heat tempering of the sword. <br />
<br />
Since the two grades of steel used have different properties, they can't be tempered the same way; the core needs to cool at a different rate than the jacket. The swordsmith would wrap the blade in a special mix of clay before heating and then cooling it, leaving the edge exposed. That way, when he dunked the heated sword in a water bucket (some sick bastards used blood of their enemies, thinking it would give the sword added strength) the edge cooled fast, while the clay-wrapped outer layer cooled slower.<br />
<br />
Anyway, that's it for katana making. A bit off topic, but this is a warrior forum, I figured some warriors would be interested in swordsmithing techniques ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Pretty much. The edge of the sword is hard so the cutting point is sharp, while the back is soft as to absorb shock. Note that the clang-clang-clang of repeated blocks you see on Highlander are entertaining but inaccurate. Most sword fights were over in one, two, perhaps three passes, and smart swordsmen parried or outright dodged incoming sword strikes. No matter how well-made a sword is, full-impact blocks will leave chips and dents.<br />
<br />
end tangent =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Solanthious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Heh, I use Jaleans Katana in my offhand as my BF is in my main, when I use to use 1hs that is.<br />
<br />
And I got mine for Ring of Vulak before we started doing Emp &gt; VT &gt; RZ so they do still drop, the risk getting them though is ass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">yeah; to an eastern swordsman; swords hitting each other in combat was considered &quot;poor skill&quot;</div></div><hr />
