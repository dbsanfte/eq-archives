<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>aspit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">so i log on today right before coirnav raid and preorder lost dungeons of norath.  I lost connection last nite in th emiddle of sol ro and couldn get back on.  So when i log on i train to ent and die so it will be an easy cr.  Little did i know when i preoredered lost dungeons it apparantly wiped all other expansion registration information from my account and immediately deleveled me to 50.  As my corpse is still in sol ro and a gm is nowhere to be found im stuck at level 50 as mt and fucked because they let chimps make their fucking registration system.  My advice to you, dont fucking order this bullshit for  a few weeks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Eep! 50th??!! ouch! I have not been 50th since the day before RoK camp out on Kailyn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Damn man sorry to hear this.  The irony is the EXACT SAME THING happened during the PoP expansion (de-level to 50 thing).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grendonbb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Heh I remember this happening an expansion or two ago... nothing quite like deleveling to lvl 50 and being stuck in PoK for 9 hours...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Apothes Drudoll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">LDoN Pre-Orders (7-17-03)<br />
Folks that pre-ordered The Lost Dungeons of Norrath are no longer seeing their other expansions.  This has caused some players to be unable to access expansion zones, caused them to be unable to see or use AA abilities and other such things.  We are working to correct this right now.<br />
<br />
Logging out and logging back in will fix this problem.<br />
<br />
Our GMs will be restoring characters that suffered a loss due to this issue.  Please use /petition and tell them what happened.<br />
<br />
Until we can get that corrected, we have turned off the ability to pre-order.  This will not affect those that have already pre-ordered, those pre-orders will remain.<br />
<br />
Thank you for pre-ordering LDoN, and thanks for playing EverQuest.<br />

GO OUTSIDE AND RESERVE LDON.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kaldanm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">well... with all your passive AAs, you could solo vox...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Menia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">You mean the AAs that were wiped from the Char as well? ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gnomb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Yeah, that was an effect some of the peeps in guild had as well.<br />
level 65 with 0 or single digit AA.<br />
Happened to our casters first of all and someone in guild was joking if that was part of the melee/caster balancing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The most fun is having to bag 3/4 or more of your gear because it has a required level of 65 or so. Dont think i have enough leftover gear in the bank to re-equip if i went down to level 50. Thank God im a procrastinator and didnt pre-order yet :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">You know what the good majority of people did when this happened? They went to go kill Lady Vox.....</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>aspit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">i relogged like they said and since i got exp since the time i deleveled all it did was give me my aa back and expansions.  So only having passive aa working and about 6500 hps fully buffed since all of my raex was banked, i decided to have some fun.<br />
