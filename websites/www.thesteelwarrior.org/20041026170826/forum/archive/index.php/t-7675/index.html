<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>lokkak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Please don't post pro/con statements about the changes.<br />
I would like this thread to contain facts.<br />
<br />
Facts like:<br />
1) The emote says &quot;blah&quot; when triggered.<br />
2) The blue trash hit for upto 978 DPS now.<br />
<br />
I have not been in tipt or any of the single group trials since the patch.<br />
<br />
I would like to hear from people that have been before and after, with details of the changes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>bargran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">can't talk about the named since patch, as i couldn't get through the trash.<br />
<br />
parsed 780 dps on a SLOWED trash mob. had to mez on inc and slow prior to engage mobs, and still dying every 2 mobs. group gave up fast.<br />
had more than 10k hp and 1k8 ac buffed.<br />
<br />
at least i have my flag, i have done it few weeks ago</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grendonbb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Wow.... I think I lucked out.<br />
<br />
Got flag two days before patch... been on vacation since.<br />
<br />
I heard from a guildy, however, that due to the supreme bitching of the Knights about defensive, SOE has answered their call.  The boss will ignore you while defensive-line disc is up, and will instead cleave through your group while you stand there and say &quot;wtf?&quot;<br />
<br />
YAY!  Thanks knights, you sure fixed the problem!  And you still can't tank the trash to get to the final boss that is still going to kick your ass!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The boss will ignore you while defensive-line disc is up, and will instead cleave through your group while you stand there and say &quot;wtf?&quot;!<br />
<br />
<br />
What in the fuck. If this is a fact, sony is stupid as hell. Destroying warrior tanking? I mean wth. I want a spellbook now. I DEMAND ONE. <br />
 :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Holywrath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I pushed 4 people through these trials since the patch.<br />
<br />
I did notice that mobs were kinda owning me when I was tanking them, but didn't think to attribute it to the patch.   Normally though, we just have the pet tank.<br />
<br />
On the boss, I wen't Furious and slowed the mob as usual, and I switched to Defensive after Furious wore off.  I didn't notice that I lost aggro.   The only thing different on that encounter for us was that the boss dropped the SILK bracer, TWICE in a row.  I've flagged MANY MANY people and have never seen the silk bracer.<br />
<br />
<br />
On a side note, last night we tried the Diabolical Destroyer.  After a good 30minutes of talking out a strat, since we had a bard for CC, we engaged.  I wen't Furious, ... had aggro, after it faded I switched to Defensive.. At this point it *thought* I had aggro, until the DD starts taking shots at other members.  They are all asking me WTF is going on, and I'm totally oblivious and answer with &quot;WTF I don't know, I SHOULD have aggro.&quot;  It would take a few rounds at me, then a few rounds at someone else and kept doing that until It killed the bard, then we all died.<br />
<br />
<br />
Since both bosses were supposed to have been nerfed,   I can only account for the variations in behavior by the enormous amount of DPS on the Tipt boss due to the pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">this is a joke?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>lokkak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">this is a joke?<br />
<br />
What do you mean?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Holywrath, you description of the DD's behavior matches what was described.  Supposedly, once per tick, the boss moves you to 2nd place on the hate list if you are defensive or evasive.  I haven't tried it myself since patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">i mean sony cant possibly be this retarded ...  they've pulled some fuckwit maneuvers in the past but this is just plain unbelievable ...<br />
<br />
basically, is this for real?  tipt was a little rough when i went through, but taking away my defensive on the Boss is not only suicide, but absolutely retarded.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bulbog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Heh there's a whole other post ranting about the changes to post in.  Ideally keep this one to straight forward info about the changes rather than  rants.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The DI was lowered of him, not sure how they adjusted DB though,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>seveirn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">guild members have been having some probs few things:<br />
<br />
1. Defensive warrior, Kyv will ignore him<br />
2. Kyv will ignore anyone Bestow DAing a pet whos tanking<br />
3. Ignored a DAed Pally tank. <br />
<br />
list goes on</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ariakkas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">mobs have always ignored a DA pally/SK since the change went in a few years back.<br />
<br />
<br />
you can still RT under DA, so i assume you'd be able to defensive while RTing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Dinekus Aleswig</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I can't comment on the tipt boss but I also have noticed the same pattern on the DD.  When I went into stonewall, he ate both my healers as soon as they landed a heal.  Gonna try him without disc tonight and see how we fare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Pumilio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">so basically having two warriors if he puts you at 2nd place aggro wise might be best?  have em both stonewall and bounc aggro around with a charmed pet doing the dps =p<br />
<br />
so when lead war gets at 2nd place aggro 2nd place war will be first, both defensive couldn't hurt hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>czai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I did this today.<br />
<br />
10.2k, 1945 ac (no focus or BSS).<br />
<br />
War, Rng, Rng, Dru, Clr, Enc  -- Time geared except me.<br />
<br />
They ramped up the trash, it now hits me for 1280 (with 2% shielding) while they hit the rangers for 13xx.  A lot of stuff is now yellow.<br />
<br />
I logged the fight with Jhiru and will post it below.  Note I engaged with furious after eating 1 round.  When it seemed to become a bit dicey I popped defensive figuring I had AET up and could click it off if I lost aggro.  I didn't lose aggro.<br />

Now the trash, I don't know, I haven't done Tipt after the change but the general consensus is that stuff has high attack again, but that's no different than pre GoD nerf I'd imagine.</div></div><hr />

also dont complain about not being able to use defenisve. these one group  encounters were desigend for level 70 so hybrids would have been able to tank them but since things happened differently the one group encounters were only passable by decently equipped tanks +super equipped hybrids. if you dont think hybrids should tank those 1 group encounters then blah blah</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Remf da Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Hola-<br />
<br />
Did another TIPT adventure last night, got creamed.  I'd swear they coded something in there to cause charm breaks at the worst possible times, and I know for sure that they coded the casters there to dispel pets to get rid of charm.  Very annoying.  Anyway, 2.3k+ AC, bit under 11k hp, and a single cleric w/o fast GoD heals couldn't spam fast heals or land CHes reliably enough to handle the 1.3k hitting yellow trash.  Stuff that used to hit for 300ish was now hitting for 900+ regularly, and proc'ing every other round (and sometimes multiple times per round).<br />
<br />
Did okay on crag beast mommy with just disc furi (pooka pets are serious blenders of destruction when dual wielding) as it barely lasted past disc.  Boss kyv slightly slowed (5%?) but dished out serious DPS, and wiped us after the aforementioned worst-possible-time charm break.  I did hit defensive then, and it did cause the boss Kyv to ignore me, so I can confirm that they have infact nerfed warrior discs on them.  Don't know the reoccurance time on the aggro blur/loss cause I didn't last long enough after everyone else got mowed down by the named and the now-free pet...<br />
<br />
Grats SoE designer idiot who &quot;rebalanced&quot; that zone, it's now my least favorite event/trial EVER, which is saying something as I *really* hated some of the previous ones... quite an annoying way to waste 1-2 hours of my life on it just to get a stupid quest drop.  What would make this trial reasonable?  Get rid of the yard trash respawn, or make it significantly weaker/slower/non-see-invis.  And have the kyv boss drop at least 3 power cells.<br />
<br />
Summary:<br />
-caster mobs (mainly snakes) dispel pets<br />
-more yellow yard trash, significantly higher DPS<br />
-defensive disc does blur/lower aggro significantly.<br />
-zone now sucks even worse than it did before.<br />
<br />
RdT.<br />

It seemed like there was less trash clearing to the 1st bridge, most of the mobs were yellow or white so we didn't pick up a pet till just before the cragbeast clearing (used a hynid for a pet).<br />
<br />
I didn't really notice that mobs were hitting me any harder, can parse it when I get home tonight and compare with previous Tipt runs but I was seeing very few max hits, most in the 3-500's. <br />
<br />
On the named at the top I used Furious  then Stonewall and didnt have any problems for agro.  Pet DPS was huge though, so probably only tanked for about 10secs past furious anyway.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>korgo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">tipt is definitely harder to tank.  Not having defensive makes it an extreme challenge to keep aggro off a cleric spamming with Holy Light and a druid (not as bad) spamming infusion.<br />

I've never done Tipt with an enchanter pet as I don't have much truck with enchanters.  Get on my nerves and got nothin for me or any group in GoD.<br />
<br />
I will say that what makes it harder is not necessarily the non-defensive it's that the healer/back up healer have little or no time to spot the fellah on rampage.<br />

If you ever want to beat ikkinz1, you better get over your dislike for chanters right quick :p<br />

Not having defensive does not lower your aggro.  If you're worried about it, open with furious, then use the aggro-disc immediately afterwards, and spam incite the whole time.  Unless you're wielding a rusty dagger and a fine steel long sword, you should be fine.  Using a 2h is definately going to help you more in this fight (at least while going furious) aggro-wise.</div></div><hr />

It's much more forgiving. But, your group has to be on it's toes. With a crisp group - every heal landing on time, good pulling/splitting, slow on time, etc. this seemed to me to be awfully easy.<br />
<br />
I felt that everything was hitting for less. Certainly not anything to be intimidated by if you've tanked in PoTime, Q'Vic, or basicly ever MT'd any raid quality mob in the last few expansions. I doubt if a bazaar Wariror could handle it, but any properly geared Tank should have no problem at all.<br />
<br />
Lost, but not because of tanking. Could have won it without miscues in about 1 1/2 hours - it's that much easier.<br />

If you are EP, this might be a challange for you. But since it's  progression content, it should be.<br />

Last time I did Tipt was before the &quot;Great GoD re-tuning&quot; and I had a good idea of my healing requirements at the time. I'm a stronger tank today. I had done the nerfed-difficulty Vxed, and it was quite easy. This weekend I finally did Tipt again.

How has charm been neutered?  I was in Tipt a couple weeks ago and charm was still stupidly overpowered as usual.  We rode a charmed pet from near zone in to the end boss.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Callon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">When was dps of trash cut down?  Last I heard, right after defensive was nerfed, trash dps appears to have been boosted back up to it's original GoD release levels.  ie. it's brutal.  I was also there a couple weeks ago and dps seemed as brutal as ever.  And was dps of charmed pets specifically cut down or do you just mean lower mob dps means the pet has lower dps? (obviously)<br />
<br />
on the 'it's to hard /cry' : same story as PoJ Trials last year...<br />
<br />
This is one of the most moronic comparisons I've seen.  Let's see... a trial that can take hours and have a good chance of a wipe at the end boss along with numerous deaths along the way to massive dps yard trash... a trial where the majority of groups get through by having a gimp ass overpowered as hell charmed pet kill everything for them and often even tank everything but the end boss for them because despite the risk it's better than having their player tank try to do it... <br />
<br />
And you're comparing that to a trial that from start to finish takes about 10-15 minutes and did not need high end gear on anyone at all or any stupidly overpowered abilities to beat?  Gimme a freaking break.  GoD trials today bear about as much resemblance to the trial of execution when PoP had been out a few months as Mt.

<br />
this is kind of a stupid question, but... <br />
by the way, he said the mob was slowed.  Does it still have to be annulled first to keep the haste from helping it?  It seems like when a mob slows me that I'm sooooooo slow that even my haste isn't working, as though slow took me down to X% of my unhasted speed where X is the percent effectiveness of the slow.  I guess I should parse it sometimes and see.  It's just my impression... that slow also in effect cancels out the haste.  I don't get slowed often enough to check it.</div></div><hr />

This is one of the most moronic comparisons I've seen....<br />
And you're comparing that to a trial that from start to finish takes about 10-15 minutes and did not need high end gear on anyone at all or any stupidly overpowered abilities to beat?  Gimme a freaking break. ..<br />
<br />
Here is your freaking break than..<br />
when PoP was new and most people where barely level 62 with &lt;50AA everyone was crying out loud about PoJ Trials beeing such a bottleneck, while everyone who pushed to 65 and/or was VT equipped went through them like a breeze..<br />
<br />
nowadays it's Time-equipped and 350+AA and the trials start in Barindu.</div></div><hr />

by the way, he said the mob was slowed.  Does it still have to be annulled first to keep the haste from helping it?  It seems like when a mob slows me that I'm sooooooo slow that even my haste isn't working, as though slow took me down to X% of my unhasted speed where X is the percent effectiveness of the slow.  I guess I should parse it sometimes and see.  It's just my impression... that slow also in effect cancels out the haste.  I don't get slowed often enough to check it.<br />
<br />
it's not a stupid question.<br />
the time it takes to slow him, he is dishing out a shitload of damage, including (with bad luck) multiple rampages etc. if your healer have anything else to do than mok/mor/ac debuff/slow/cripple him before furious runs out, you might be in trouble. and if slow does not stick on first cast, you are for sure.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For PCs slow will cancel haste.<br />
<br />
For NPCs they will stack. So yeah the mob was slowed (25% or whatever after mitigation) but he still had 70% haste on.<br />

This is from all the shaman and Chanters in my guild, and from what I remember playing my shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">KT will never be as bad as bot for one simple reason - it takes effort to get there, even if the trials become trivial.<br />
<br />
The only time the bot key was &quot;hard&quot; was when you needed to kill the Lords for the key, who were ~AoW difficultuy or so.<br />
<br />
Once they made it so you just needed two minits - it was really easy to get bot key, however it still was a decently private zone, because a lot of people who are the worst players in EQ absolutly abhor any type of 'work' to get to a zone. 6 trials, even if really easy, would keep out a lot of people, just because its effort to get the groups, and complete them.<br />

I havnt done tipt since patch but the mobs (trash) should be like what they were after the first revamp of GoD, aka like how vxed is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">The Furious/Defensive (Or Stonewall) nerf is ridiculous.  We weren't using a pet (no chanter), yet we were more than confident we could take on the boss.  Boss is inc and mows through the rogue.  Then he mows through the bard.  Then he mows through my goddamn cleric.  Then he mows through the shaman.  Finally, he mows through me because there's nothing left to heal.<br />
<br />
Why?  Because of his fucking goddamn emote that changes his agro to someone NOT using discs.  Great, why even bother tanking this guy cause I know I can't initially outagro my cleric who is chaining the fuck out of her Supernal Light button.  <br />

Charm something and they lose their dual wield ability.  They will still triple, but not very regularly.  Give them weapons and they go from ~650dps to ~1100dps.  I just LOVE a mission that is balanced around this kind of firepower.  /sigh</div></div><hr />

<br />
My friends and I regularly beat the trial of execution within a month or two of PoP coming out with almost no raid gear and around L62ish characters.  Our AAs would have been around 50ish back then.  <br />
<br />
That's nothing like the trials for Kod'Taz access that take hours each and in some cases (Tipt in particular) are virtually impossible for a player to tank without a lot of elem+ raid gear.  I won't say impossible because someone always comes along with the exception, but close.  People without a time/elem tank follow a charmed pet through and hope to survive the boss.  The time required, the risk level, etc. blows away where PoJ trials ever were.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Behemot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">Dispel is your friend in both Tipt and Ikkinz. Dispel the mobs on pull, their dps will be lowered more than by the slow, because many mobs are hasted. We have also noticed in Ikkinz on Kyvs that Annul Magic was of no use, it dispels 2 buffs, prolly the kyv had the haste in 3-4. slot. When a chanter dispelled the kyv with recant magic (4 buffs dispel), it became easy.<br />
In Tipt, trash dps was indeed increased greatly since the patch. If anyone didn't notice it, then it's because he had someone in the group dispelling the mobs and/or he had very good healers.<br />
The charmed pooka for the final mob is good for both the dps, and because it will take the rampage damage. Tash malos the pet before each recharm to make sure the charm lasts for the longest duration. If you have a ranger to WS the final Kyv, 20 secs later the war takes over with furious and AE taunt, and a pet is beating on it meanwhile, there is little possibility for wipe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's how we won a couple days ago.  I hadn't read this though and we pulled with annul magic and didn't do anymore dispels.  The ranger WS tanked.  Then I AE taunted and riposte tanked.  I died within 5-6 seconds of riposte disc dropping.  Fortunately before I even zoned on death I saw the pet finish off Jhiru.  What a pain though... guildie is trying to tell me Tipt is easy.  He doesn't play a tank.  :p  I assume he's been going with elem/time geared tanks and not even realizing it.</div></div><hr />

unless the chanter gets out of the area as fast and as far as he can, it is him that will take the rampage, not the pet.  And Rampage range on Jihru is huge.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">The surprise hasted mobs are what makes tipt chew through people from my experience.

Grp was War, SK, Clr, Enc, Dru, Bard - and it went like this:<br />
<br />
Bard dispelled/fade, HoS/fade, RoT/fade (slow resisted), pulled again with HoS and backed Jhiru to group (on right side of room), bard disced and tried slow again, Warrior jumped in with Furious (Pet engaged by this point) - was looking good until Furious expired, War hit Stonewall (thinking defensive was nerfed), and got emote something like ' I'm not going to waste my time beating down your defenses.....I will feast on your companions' Jhiru ate pet (cleric didnt notice), Sk jumped HT and died with Jhiru at 27% summons finished the rest of them. Actually cleric never got aggro and rezzed everyone (yeah he must of been sleeping I'm thinking), but without pet and little dps there was not much to do, but decided to test defensive on Jhiru just to see what emote I got - didnt get one with defensive up.<br />
<br />
So what gives, what discs are nerfed? and what is the best strat for engaging him with the given group. I am sure if pet had been properly buffed and cleric had healed him we would have won, but still want to know how the warrior should have played this one.<br />

Oh yeah I was boxing the warrior so its not that I am dissing him!- I think its stupid that warriors can't use their given discs, they are supposed to have defensive discs for  big mobs, it is what they do.</div></div><hr />

It is very stupid, but basically Verant cannot make Jhinru tankable by paladins, while remaining challenging to warriors if they allow warriors to use defensive.<br />
<br />
Riposte however is still a huge factor on him, so warriors still have the edge, but it is kind of a lame nerf.  I actually think he is harder to tank for warriors since disc nerf.</div></div><hr />

<br />
sorry, late response... actually I'm not quite in KT yet.  I did vxed/tipt  before I did most of the sewers because a friend was doing the mountains and kept inviting me.  Sewers are definitely easier and granted the loot sucks (no named spawning at all!  spawn rate must be nerfed all to hell.), but I'm happier actually being able to do my main tank job.  The tough  thing is getting a good group who can play for a long ass trial.   <br />
<br />
One more to go... Sewers #4... and then I'm in Kod'Taz.  btw, it seemed like even a couple weeks ago when I beat #1 (hardest sewer, IMO), the sewers were harder.  And I hadn't done The Lair since shortly after  GoD was released when it was really hard for me.  My AC and hit points have gone up since then, but not by a huge amount.  The mobs just aren't hitting as hard when I did the Lair this week.  Like those unslowable abandoned workers that beat the hell out of me before with numerous over 1k  to 1.2k hits... they were a non issue.  They barely ever came near their max hits on my 1700ish AC.  Not sure if they are even hitting for a lower max in the Lair than they use to, I didn't parse it, but the difference was very noticeable.  Maybe they're still brutal in the Plant?  *shrug*<br />
<br />
Tipt is definitely still brutal.  I still say you need elem/time gear to be a good tank there.  The rest of us follow the damn pet and watch most of the time.  I'm afraid that means I'll have major difficulties tanking KT when I get there.  <br />
<br />
But the sewers definitely seem even more directed at pre elem tank AC levels now, and that includes the harder trials there, though the Plant will probably still be pretty rough for many.   I just wish the named actually spawned.  Maybe we're unlucky, but we're not seeing any named now.  In around 13-15 hours of steady sewers killing, we've gotten one good random trash mob drop and no named.</div></div><hr />
