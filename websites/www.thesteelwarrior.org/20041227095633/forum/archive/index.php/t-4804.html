<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Carnatus</div><div class="date">12-18-2003, 06:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe someone can explain to me why the discipline timers are so long.  I can under stand the power built into furious, but over all most of the disicpline are not totally devastating.  Basically I see them as having to ends to the spectrum of their use that SoE would be concerned about: <br />
<br />
1) How many time could disc001 be used during a UberMob001 fight (you know the mob with HP just shy of a bizzilion) <br />
<br />
2) How badly would they effect Minibossmob001 (the less than uber types.)<br />
<br />
In the case of number 1, a warrior getting 30 seconds of crits is mouse nuts compared to the overall amount of damage needed to take these guys down.  You could riposte Seru for a minute and and a half and not see his HP move much. So does it really break the game if disciplines are down to every few minutes with a cost to endurance? rather than these long ass delays?<br />
<br />
IN the case of number 2, if you are talking a 32k hp mob, the content may be come a bit more trivial for the melee types if the disc refresh was lowered, but for a large portion of the population 32k hp encounters are pretty trivial at this point anyway.  What difference does it make if my disc is ready again in a few minutes if the miniboss001 is dead? should I use my disc again on henchman001, who will die before the disc is even done?<br />
<br />
It just seems to me that the disciplines are overly guarded due to a few of them having rather powerful implications, when in practice most of them are either useless due to long timers, or just flat out useless.<br />

You have to consider the implications in an xp group though. If you could be totally invulnerable to melee attacks for half the duration of a kill every couple minutes, it would no longer be an 'oh, shit' or situational discipline, it would be used every opportunity you get.<br />
Further trivializing already-bordering-on-trivial encounters is not cool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ealsur Helevorn</div><div class="date">12-18-2003, 09:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Right now, at lvl65, try chaining Furious, Stonewall and Fellstrike, while you use Incite once. Now go and sit, cause your endurance bar is empty. Why do you want disciplines to pop every 5 minutes if you wont be able to use em? Healing Will has a 5 min reuse time *shrugs*. I find the current setup of reuse times pretty decent, keep in mind that now you can use several disciplines one after the other (if your endurance bar holds it).</div></div><hr />
