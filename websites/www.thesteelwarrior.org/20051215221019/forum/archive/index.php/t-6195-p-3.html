Roughly a 20 minute spawn, has 2 PHs if I recall correctly (one being the normal Drelzna), easy kill. I spent roughly 6 hours there yesterday and we had 4 drop.</div></div><hr />

The list was 3-4 pages long.  Would've taken me a lot of hours waiting in line to get one.  Maybe Ill try next week when the crowd dies down a bit.<br />
<br />
I wonder what this will do to the server economy?  Hmm . . .<br />
<br />
Also there is a fabled Ring of the Ancients.  Maybe that leads to the fabled JBoots?</div></div><hr />

I thought I would mix it up by trying to pull the fabled king to frenzy... and it worked. Got myself a fabled mith2h. Only worked once though.<br />
<br />
The problem I ran into is that after killing the guards in his room (was dumb of me since king can be single pulled) a shaman popped and sowed him when he respawned and I got owned trying to get back to dead side. I'm sure if I had some pumice on me I could have dispelled him on the pull. Oh well, was fun :) Got fabled fbss, exe axe, mith2h, and ee bag wute!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crour</div><div class="date">03-23-2004, 02:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So far i've got the fabled jboots twice ( once for alt ), Fabled mithril 2 handed sword, fabled bag of sewn evil eye, and fabled<br />
short sword of yekesha (spelling?). today i'm gonna do see if I can get the fabled mithril breastplate would love to have that 61 ac ). oh for those with questions on the mobs fabled drelzna (spelling?) hits for about 100 damage not bad at all for her boots.<br />
the fabled king in lower guk hits for around 1000+. the fabled frenzied ghoul hits around 700+. I never got smacked by the fabled evil eye so i cant tell yall how much he hits for. the fabled ghoul lord hits for about the same as the king. they all have (except drelzna.) around 50k hp so they are pretty tough but when u have lots of people helping it isn't bad.</div></div><hr />
