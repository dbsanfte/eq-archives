Is there a value available in Lucy, EQMu, or elsewhere that lays out how much hate a given proc will generate?  I've heard stun (assuming all stuns are equal) procs generate about 500 hate, but of course there is no hard data I've seen and there are a lot more procs then just stuns.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anger - 1100 (650 + stun)<br />
enraging blow - 700<br />
anger 3 - 600<br />
Rage of Zek - 500 (used to have ac debuff)<br />
Rage of Vallon - 500 (used to have ac debuff)<br />
Force Shock, Planar Strike, Planar Stun, Rocksmash, etc - 450 (common agreement on stun hate)<br />
taunting blow - 450<br />
ac debuffs - 400 (not confirmed)<br />
anger 2 - 400<br />
anger 1 - 200<br />
<br />
The only ones that you can determine actual numbers for are the anger procs, enraging/taunting blow procs, and epic procs. And they are all listed in lucy.<br />
<br />
Anger (DBotW) (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3624&amp;source=Live) <br />

Basically pure hate procs are best, then stuns, then rune/debuffs, and dd procs are ass for agro.<br />
<br />
Anyone see something I missed?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is this based on observation and experimentation or on hard values from some place?<br />
<br />
So something like Muddy gem of lifetapping (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=26562) would be kinda crap for aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">04-28-2004, 06:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Muddy Gem would be considered a dps proc.<br />
<br />
The hate values I listed are pulled straight from everquest's spell file. I can't speak for where the 450 hate from stuns came from, but it's been general consensus (sp?) for a long time now.<br />
<br />
That's why CHoS and SotBS are excellent weapons for agro for the average warrior, because they both proc stuns. It's also why paladins have np stealing agro with their stuns they can cast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">04-28-2004, 08:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The relative amount of hate that stuns generate was derived from many hours of testing stun agro from pally stun spells (the unknown variable) to SK hate spells (the known constant). I forget who did the testing now, but the evidence was conclusive and can be easily reproduced. They where able to come up with ~450 hate for a stun, which also seems to match the &quot;feel&quot; of a stun proc.</div></div><hr />

would be .. except i notice its a type 7 aug. and some weapons have a slot for both type 4 and type 7 although im not aware of any such weapon that already has an inate proc.<br />
<br />
anyone know more about it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gaylon</div><div class="date">04-30-2004, 10:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nice info..thanks :)<br />
<br />
Is there any similar info about the amount of Hate generating by certain spells...i.e Slows?.<br />
<br />
It may just be me but it sure does seem that Chanter slow is less hate than Shaman slow?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">04-30-2004, 11:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm fairly certain slow agro is dependant on the % slowed.  So, an enchanter slow (70%) will probably be a little bit less agro than the shaman slow (75%).  <br />
<br />
Just my guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kelvon</div><div class="date">04-30-2004, 04:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What I notice when playing my 62 shaman is that I seemed to generate less hate for slow (succeed or fail) then an equal level chanter did, whereas the chanter would generate less aggro for cripple then I did.<br />
<br />
Maybe it just seemed that way and isn't true.<br />
<br />
Also notice that failed slows generate a lot more hate then a successful one.<br />
<br />
So what I need is a 1hs that always fails on slow!!!!  :D</div></div><hr />

taunting blow - 450<br />
<br />
So based on that, my CHoS(anger2) would be better then CHSD unaug'd right? Would it be better then an Elporn's Cleaver (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=28810)(anger2)?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hmm...does this mean that the only difference in hate between the 2 Ykesha augments is the dps difference?  Also, is the only difference in hate on the procs for the CHoS and SoBS the dmg difference in the procs?  (I realize the wpn ratios affect overall hate...I'm only talking about the expected hate from the procs on each)<br />
<br />
That doesn't sound right, especially considering the procs have different maximum levels they can affect.  BUT - I haven't done any parsing or testing...it just seems odd to me and I wanted to make sure I was reading the post correctly.  (i.e.:  I'm not questioning the validity of the statements...I'm only making sure I've read them correctly)<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Spells and procs generate the same aggro whether they land fully, are partially resisted, or are fully resisted.  I believe this was proven first over on Graffe's, but it's been backed up by many other people.  Paladins and Shadowknights, for example, often use low-level spells to draw aggro even though they have little chance of landing.<br />
<br />
I agree, though, that this doesn't make much sense.  You'd think that the mob would be happy that it was resisting spells instead of getting angrier, heh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm pretty sure that is correct.<br />
<br />
That doesn't sound right, especially considering the procs have different maximum levels they can affect.<br />
<br />
Planar Strike and Planar Stun work on mobs upto 65, while Force Shock only works on mobs up to 55, but you still get the agro even if the mob is immune to the stun effect. At least that's the way I understand it, anyone care to back me up or shoot me down?<br />
<br />

<br />
Yes and yes.<br />
<br />
Anger from DBoW is NOT 1150.<br />
<br />
Its 700ish like a normal EB (actually we think the stun component has zero agro)<br />
<br />
DBotW Anger proc is 650 pure hate per lucy so it's actually less than Enraging Blow. I don't know if the stun causes agro (don't see why not since the weapon is obvisouly designed to hold agro), but if it does then you would get around 1100 hate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DG-Slider</div><div class="date">04-30-2004, 06:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What aggro do you think DoTs come in at like Boiling Blood? I love the Ornate Greatsword I have and thought about putting an aug on but I doubt it will ever be an Aggro holding weapon. I may use it for when I off-tank or want to minimize ripostes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">04-30-2004, 07:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would assume dots go with debuffs since they linger on the mob for a while, but don't quote me on that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rookz</div><div class="date">04-30-2004, 09:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know from my years as a shaman that the type of DoT matters greatly... if it's a poison based dot, the agro is pretty damn good...  magic based dots are somewhat inconspicuous, and disease based dots don't seem to bother anyone =).<br />
<br />
As for bounced spells yielding the same agro, I can vouch that this is true.  I have been in plenty of situations where I had to pull agro with my shaman (either no tank was available, or I was just temporarily pulling agro off the chanter till the tank could get it back) and used the level 14 dissempower spell (lower version of cripple).  I could pull agro whether or not it landed.  I haven't parsed this per se, but after playing a shaman for way to long,  I do know it takes 3 casts to pull agro off a chanter who tashed and mezzed twice...  3 casts whether or not it lands.<br />
<br />
As for it being silly that a mob would be equally pissed that the spell bounced, this actually makes sense to me...  If we have 3 mobs in camp, and one of the adds suddenly bounces slow off our MT, all else being equal, I'm almost inclined to call for a target change to kill the damn caster before it manages to land a slow on our tank, or other melee classes.  (not saying that this is always tactically advantageous, just saying that sometimes it makes you want to =P).  If the dang thing already managed to slow everyone, then the damage is done, and the mob can wait it's turn for the guiliteen (sp?).  hehe, at least that's my perspective =D</div></div><hr />

<br />
might need to do some test with tigir's insects though to see the agro per counter thing (-200 hate component of spell vs. 50% slow and 16 counters)<br />

450 hate plus procs<br />

third (not a bad spot many ar very close to second place or exceed in some intastances but as a whole catagory tend to lack more then exceed)<br />

non counter debuffs and dots<br />

What would give someone the idea that the stun component would have zero agro?  I've always understood all stuns generate the same hate, regardless, otherwise why even have procs that utilize a 0.0 sec duration?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Graal the Dorf</div><div class="date">05-02-2004, 11:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">All stuns that I have available to cast seem to give the same hate if cast at the same range, but that's anecdotal.<br />
<br />
In tests comparing hate produced from stuns relative to SK +hate spells, all stuns gave the same hate (with a small difference for the +DD stuns). Duration and max level don't seem to affect the hate produced.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">05-03-2004, 02:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i have a hard time believing that the DBoTW's stun component adds nothing to the mix.  from what my uber friends have told me, 1 proc from DBoTW goes almost twice as far as a proc from a bagged BF.<br />
<br />
i forget exactly how they tested it ... but it was something like they pulled a mob in w/ an arrow and, using a shield to negate offhand swings, waited till they got off a proc on the 1st-4th swings and stopped attacking ... then having a shaman cast slow on the mob until the warrior lost aggro.<br />
<br />
<br />
with BF the shaman got aggro on the 2nd slow after 1 initial proc.  on DBoTW it was something like the 3rd or 4th slow to snag aggro.  it's not the most foolprooftest, but it certainly convinced my friend.</div></div><hr />
