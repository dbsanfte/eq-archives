I'm a 47 iksar, so if I started with about 5k to spend, how long would it take me to make a decent profit in each of the more profitable tradeskills?  Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Most people who make money with tradeskills are GM smiths, or close to it.<br />
<br />
Blacksmithing, Jewelcrafting, Tailoring, Baking prolly the big money makers.<br />
<br />
and to get to a skill you can make things people want to buy for decent cash, your prolly gonna have to fork out 100K+ in materials just to get your skill to the required level.<br />
<br />
Post 150ish in any tradeskill is mind breaking, sitting for hours on end at a forge, or an oven, clicking 500 combines, for one skill up, well, it just wasnt worth it for me.<br />
<br />
Fletching is prolly the easiest for us to work up, as we use from day to day the items we would be making for skill ups (arrows).  And some really nice bows can be made that sell pretty well.<br />
<br />
If I was you, id do fletching, but thats cause im lazy, and never got into the tradeskills (tried the shawl quest with my wizard, quit after finishing 3, cause i couldnt stand tradeskills anymore)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gimmel</div><div class="date">05-12-2003, 07:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Most tradeskills are going to be difficult to skill up in as a warrior unless you have a great set of tradeskill int/wis gear. Smithing would be an exception, since I beleive the highest of your int/wis/str is used to determine skillup rate.<br />
<br />
Brewing is the cheapest of all the tradeskills, but kind of tough to make much money at, and Mino Heros Brews will make the strongest wrists beg for mercy.<br />
Jewelcraft is probably the easiest, and less expensive than most people think, especially with a geerlok.<br />
Pottery is fairly expensive to raise at higher levels, and a pain unless you have access to an enchanter.<br />
Smithing and tailoring are only for the most hardcore of tradeskillers in my opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Keane Abrams</div><div class="date">05-12-2003, 07:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fletching also goes off dexterity for skillups. But do not expect to make much money in fletching. The market on my server has bottomed out for Nightmare Bows (3k max now) and that leaves only a small profit if you buy the components needed in the bazaar. <br />
<br />
For fletching you will need to be making Elemental bows to make real plat and even then you need to be 250 skill and hunting in the planes to get the parts.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gerili</div><div class="date">05-13-2003, 04:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Being you are a warrior regardless which skill you decide to take I HIGHLY recommend getting either wis/int up or getting whatever the corisponding stat to skill is ie str for smithing, dex for tailering etc.<br />
<br />
quick rundown of the skills<br />
<br />
Brewing, very cheep to get to round 188, starts to get a little more costly but I have heard of decent pp selling grobs liquidized meat and kalidam constitutonal.<br />
<br />
baking, pretty cheap to get to round 191, and can make okay pp selling misty picknicks etc, but market little flooded.<br />
<br />
pottery, since nerf been much harder to get up and will start to get frustrating as you reach the 200 mark, however some decent stuff to be sold via pottery.<br />
<br />
fishing, although not an &quot;official&quot; tradeskill, cheapest of all, and can make blessed fishing rods when you get to 200.<br />
<br />
jewelcraft, cost round 2k w/ high stat to get to round 190, and even then cant make anything worth while, plus need someone to imbue materials.  Market is already flooded.<br />
<br />
tailering, can get to 66 quick for round 700 pp, after that it starts getting slower and alot of farming involved.  Wouldnt go for this less really lots o pp to burn or lot of time on your hands.<br />
<br />
smithing, round 4k can get you to around 188 (w/ good stats) but will need round 230 to make anything worth while, has benifit of culteral items to make/sell.  Definitely not for weak at heart, but if you stick to it probably has your greatest chance of outcome, especially seing as it is also based off str, something most wars have good anyays.  just get some str gear and have a shammy buff you before you start.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">05-13-2003, 04:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">First and foremost ... get POTTERY to level 122.<br />
<br />
Will save you cash on gate potions, as you can make your own.<br />
<br />
That is unless you're KoS in Thurg, then nevermind about that.<br />
<br />
After that, it's up to you.<br />
<br />
Tailoring is much easier than it used to be. But that's not saying much.<br />
<br />
Smithing is a pain.<br />
<br />
Fletching is fun, but not all that rewarding.<br />
<br />
Jewelcrafting is kinda pointless for you.<br />
<br />
Baking is great. Making your OWN Tormentor Stiry Fry or 10 pound meat pies is pretty cool. And as an Iksar you can FORAGE which helps.<br />
<br />
FISHING is almost useful. You can make 250 range throwing items with fletching and fishing. You can also make a solstice earring quest item with 200 fishing and the aforementioned forage.<br />
<br />
Brewing is still easy enough to raise through just storebought stuff, it'll just kill you on some of the combines.<br />
<br />
Pick whichever one you like; and if that's more than one, work on em both. MOST tradeskills overlap past 100 skill anyways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">05-13-2003, 05:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i had some friends tried to get to GM level to make money and decided i would be better of spending all those hours farming/clicking hunting in cash zones. if you have plenty of time to play EQ then fine, but unfortunately my time is limited to would rather be  raiding/exping than tradeskilling.<br />
<br />
what i have done is to work on pottery for thurg gate potions (took an hour plus to get to 140 or thereabouts) and fletching cos i like to make my own arrows.<br />
<br />
I was considering going into baking but with the market so flooded these days i can pick up all the nice stat food i need reallly cheaply so just didnt see the point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Riknan</div><div class="date">05-13-2003, 09:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK i am a tradeskill Junkie lol but,, as was stated above brewing is the cheapest to get up in skill, and can make some money off of GLM's and so so on kaladim consta's ,<br />
<br />
Baking is cheap to get up towards 200s and can make HMP's and MTPs which are really flooded atm so sell for hmps about 4 to 5pp a piece  and the mtp's for about 10 to 20pp a piece and if you look up on eqtraders both especially the mtps have alot of sub combines,<br />
<br />
Smithing  is decent money maker at 230+ skill on some of the armors but you really need to get cultural armor and iksar is not a race were that is a choice that i know of, and will take you alot of money to get to 230s 5k is a drop in the bucket ,<br />
<br />
Pottery is not a bad option but is tougher now that they nerfed it to get to 122 is simple  really but after that it will take some farming to go beyond or pp to buy skins depending on the route you take but PoP items are still selling decent,<br />
<br />
<br />
Jewelry, is not a bad option either but to GM it 5k will not touch it it is a good skill to sit at a vendor and sell back to merchant as you skill up JC is my Gmed skill atm and is not a bad money maker on PoP jewlery But till you get higher lvl the components  are spendy to get like metallic liquid for instance costs 5k or so on terris   for valor rings not including the razorfiend talons whic are about 5ooish pp and the brick of valoriom and the vial of distilled mana that you will need, Which btw in trades it is best if you go on one you should master all imho,, like in the valor ring for one of the many examples you need to combine the bar of valorium and vial of distilled mana in a taanan forge to make the enchanted bar triv is 135 in smithing<br />
<br />
All and all my point is that all skills take alot of time to do if you are going into for just money RUN away now  you will not make it to GM on any skill period. <br />
<br />
Now if you love to just do tradeskills it is alot of fun and can be awarding i can make 30k a week on good weeks  and lose that amount in a blink of a eye also.  <br />
<br />
But i just plain love to do trades  is my real reason to do em  <br />
<br />
Which ever way you choose GL friend <br />

You need to be pretty damn wealthy to skill up this way. Going from 202-218(current) I have dropped about 8k total with minimal failures.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">05-14-2003, 01:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You should really consider how much of a commitment you want to make to tradeskilling if you want to do it for profit. Currently my skills are 244 pottery, 240 JC, 228 brewing, 210 baking, 200 fletching, 176 smithing, 174 tailoring. Even with some of the big ticket pottery items available to me (elemental items) I still go through plats faster than a fat kid eats chocolate cake.<br />
<br />
For 5k you can actually master several trade skills (100+), but you aren't going to make any money at that level. To be profitable enough to have a good cash flow you are going to have to GM a skill so you can make the items that sell. Brewing is the cheapest skill to GM, but it is also the least profitable. JC is actually pretty cheap as well if you can get high enough wis/int and cha over 110. JC is a pretty good skill if you can get ahold of the rare PoP drops to make the good items. You are a ways off from being able to farm any of those drops at your level so you would be stuck buying them - which of course cuts into your profit considerably.<br />
<br />
Fletching can be done inexpensively if you farm all the components you need to make acrylia arrows. Plan on spending weeks (months is more realistic) farming enough components to get your skill over 220.<br />
<br />
Smithing can also be done somewhat inexpensively if you make shadowscream armor. Again, the down side is that you will have to farm the ingredients for months to get enough to get your skill high enough to make it worthwhile.<br />
<br />
All of the other trade skills are going to cost many thousands of plats to get high enough to make the items that sell. Expect to spend at least 40k+ to get in the 220-230 range in any of those skills, even if you can farm your own ingredients.<br />
<br />
On top of all of this, you have to consider what is happening with the player made item market. With the completion of the aid Gimil quest, there are droves of elemental guild level people that are taking all of their trade skills to 220+. It cost a ton of plats to do this and they have to finance their tradeskilling somehow. As a result, high end elemental trade skill items are popping up all over the place now and as more and more people become capable of making the items, the prices are coming down quickly. On my server, elemental bows are down to 150k (air bow) and 220k (earth bow) and there are always 2 or 3 bows for sale in the bazaar. A month ago, you would be lucky to see 1 bow for sale in a week and 300k+ was the price.<br />
<br />
Of course this does bring up yet anothr option. You can still make money from lower level trade skilling if you know what to make. Take a look at the market on your server and figure out what is selling well. Then figure out what sub combines go into making those items. You can make a killing selling things such as celestial essense, various tempers, and various dyes among other things. Find out what the most common methods for skill ups are for high level trade skillers and farm the components they need. Make cod oil for tailoring, farm pelts for tailoring, farm acrylia and velium pieces.<br />
<br />
I think you will find that you can make a lot more money selling trade skill ingredients than you can doing the actual trade skills, unless you are prepared to commit 10s of thousands of plats and many weeks to GM a skill.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First of all, woohoo, I can finally post here :)<br />
<br />
Second, go check out www.eqtraders.com, it's the mecca for tradeskill info.  There's a couple skills you can get to 200 w/ minimal plat; you could probably get to 248 brewing on a few hundred plat, tho you'd spend RL cash paying for the physical therapy from all the clicking mino hero brews take.  But you could probably get 199 pottery, 200 fletching, 200 brewing, 191 baking, and 200 jewelcraft on 5k if you were careful and bought/sold with 115+ cha and good faction.<br />
<br />
Having good Wis/Int gear helps a TON; with KEI + brain food, I hit 244 wis/224int (from a base of like 60) which help immensely for skillups.<br />
<br />
