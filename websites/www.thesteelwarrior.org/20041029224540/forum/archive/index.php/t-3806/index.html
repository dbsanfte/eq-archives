<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Draganetti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My guild is attempting to address the problem of melee continually looting weapon upgrades, spending often over 50% of their dkp on weapons, most of which have been bagged.  Some people obviously get lucky and get a &quot;end-game&quot; item without a whole bunch of upgrade-steps inbetween.  Others spend alot.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I was curious as to if anyone used a dkp system where melee weapons are treated differently than other item slots?  Does anyone have a system where weapons are dkp-free, while other armor has costs?  Does anyone give dkp refunds for obsolete weapons?  percentages?  Does anyone have a totally separate dkp number for weapons as other armor?  I'm not really interested in bidding sytems as that's not really the way we want to go.<br />
<br />
I just want to know if anyone has found a good balance between using dkp for weapons, and being fair to melee vs. casters (who upgrade their primary/secondary slots much less). . .you know, the whole weapons = spell argument.  Also, some people really get screwed by continually upgrading weapons, and some get lucky by scoring an end-game-type item early on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kilaara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">In our system the max cost of a weapon is 50 DKP ( BoW, Ifir .. )and armor ( included caster handheld items ) is 100.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ronaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">we have a minimum cost of 50 for elemental armor.<br />
warrior EB proc weapons are fixed at 110 for BoW and the warriors themselves /random or decide among them who gets it.<br />
BoC was refundable for part of the points (fixed cost was 75 at the time).<br />
<br />
we have an open bidding system otherwise with no set maximum. the most expensive items have gone for upwards of 300 points, at 2 points per raid hour that's quite a price to pay ;)<br />
<br />
warrior EB weapons are our only items with fixed price (we have minimums for just about anything else), which tells me something about the taunt situation as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Qris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">We have a set amount of points, 5 is the lowest and 30 is the highest I think.  Those who want to go in tell whatever officer is doing the loot and the person with the most points wins the item for the designated price (price is given before hand).  This prevents anyone from having to spend a ton of points on an item.<br />
<br />
Point values are determined by the quality of the item, what classes can use and I *think* whether it is droppable or not.  For instance, BoW is 25 points, we only allow warriors in on it.  Ele molds are 25 I think, possibly 20.<br />
<br />
If no one wants at designated price then we allow trials to go in and use their points.  If no members or trials want then guests get the item for free.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i like the upgrade and wait. just upgraded that slot well cant upgrade hat slot again for set amount of time. dropables are excluded since they can be returned, and re alocated to another normaly the second place bidder. first place is refunded the bid of the second place winner or the bid of the person who recives the droppable item if no bid was place by reciver then 90% of dkp is refunded. encourages renturn of droppables. little extra work for the dkp keeper once used to it np though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Drunken Mick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">To give an idea... if you talk about DKP, RC, RP whatever... it's important to note the value for the mobs killed to give an idea of the value of the item.<br />
<br />
For instance:  RZTWL - 1RC earned... BoW cost 18RC<br />
Most mold mobs in PoF: .5RC earned... arms, boots, bracer, gaunts 18RC, helm 20RC, legs 24RC BP 26RC.<br />
<br />
BoC - free to guild warrior mains who are active and they remain guild property.<br />
<br />
Some of the more interesting developments tho... phase I time farming is free lewts... since most stuff would rot if we didn't do it that way.<br />
<br />
Most weapons aren't very expensive.  Reason being as he stated... DW melee gettin hit the hardest.  Most decent weps are around 5-8RC.  Some really good bargains are the Ornate Greatblade (2RC!) etc...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If your melees are being retarded with their points spending there isn't much you can do other then get rid of them. Even if you start tacking on limits on weapons per bid cycle (months ,etc) it will just hide the problem and push it onto armor or misc items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The whole point of having a DKP system is to put the power to upgrade in the individuals hands. When you start adding in a bunch of exceptions and special rules, you are taking away from the system. Of course, this also assumes that the people who are asking for the items are not retards. You have to have faith in your guildmates to make intelligent decisions - pallys and SKs pass on bidding for BoWs for instance. We have set values for all items, if you want something you put your name in.<br />
<br />
BTW - what makes you think casters upgrade primary/secondary less often? Sure if you are comparing someone who tries to get every single weapon that drops, but seriously, no class needs to upgrade their weapons every 2 weeks. Every class has weapons that are considered the best for the level you are at, if someone wants to take every possible upgrade between what they have now and what the best your guild can get, then that is their business no matter how much of a waste of DKP it is. You have to have a plan and stick with it, not take everything that is a slight upgrade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Draganetti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well, of their total dkp spent, i'm seeing melees spend anywhere from 45 to 80% of their dkp on weapons, where as priests and casters are spending anywhere from 8% to 40%.  Casters don't need to spend massive dkp for a very slight upgrade to the stats of their primary/secondary item when they can spend the same points on another inventory slot and get a massive upgrade.  A melee's weapon is life.<br />
<br />
Perhaps we just need to reduce weapon dkp costs across the board compared to armor (BoW in our system is 90 and smaller elemental pieces are 100 for comparison).  The problem is things like the rotting fist from bertox are still 70 points. . .sure it was nice when you killed bertox for the first time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ladas Sindarin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Its hard to tell without knowing your raid pricing scheme, but sounds like you system lacks a method to subjectively price items relative to other items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Originally posted by Ladas Sindarin <br />
Its hard to tell without knowing your raid pricing scheme, but sounds like you system lacks a method to subjectively price items relative to other items.  Yup. Your system has to take in to account that an item should decrease in cost as better items become available. When we first got into the elems, Ornate Greatblades where normal cost, after a month of farming they dropped in price considerably due to how common they are and the higher desireablity of other 2h weapons available at that level. 70 dkp for Rotting Fist is probably ok when you first doing Bertox, but by the time you have gotten to the elems that price needs to drop by about 50% or more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Krowbar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">For us melee weapon costs are capped at 1/4th of the armor cap. So currently the most expensive item is 60 dkp which very few items actually reach. (Quarm Earring, Bertox mask are the only ones so far.) So the most expensive weapon would be 15 dkp but I dont recall any weapon going for that much. Vanazir is 14 dkp for example. This doesn't apply to caster weapons.  Also weapons taken as range slot get the range slot cost.<br />
<br />
The costs dont scale however. The not-so-end-game calibre items tend to go for a lot less. Rotting fist for example was 6 dkp. Periodically an officer goes through and reduces prices but this is not retroactive.  Weapons without a proc and/or low hps go for 1-3 dkp tops. Also, some weapons did go for free. Wrath's edge was awarded to MTs for 0 dkp as it was useful for tanking emp (when we thought the damage done mattered for aggro).<br />
<br />
Melee tend to upgrade weapons more than any other item because our whole game tends to revolve around them. Casters are not bound by this need as they rely on spells which are distributed free to everyone in order of total dkp worth.  It's pretty much an obligation to the guild to make sure your gear is optimal, especially for the MTs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Zynth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">i think the main problem is that a caster is always just as effective, excluting focus effects, as the next lvl 65 of the same class, in that they can always preform their primary funtion just  as effectivly from having access to the spells that are tradeable, where as a melee is more dependant on their weapons to do their primary function that are close to always no drop in the higher end.<br />
to break it down a little better, assuming we're talking about the higher end game, all clerics will have CH, all shammies will have slow, all chanters will have mez/kei+, and all wizards will have nukes, or at the very least, be able to buy those spells at any point they gain enough cash to do so. but, not every ranger will have a decent bow, not ever warrior will have good agro weapons, and not every rogue will have a really good piercer. in fact, it's worse for a tanking class which will be required to have agro AND the HP to survive, where most of the other melees just need a good weapons and the common sence to avoid damage.<br />
from personal experiance with my current guild that i've been in since creation and farming HoT for armor, weapons always go high the first time they drop, but are usually the first to go down in price since they are highly classist, in that we always give first dibs for obvious weapons to the proper classes. if a ranger wants a bow and it's a big upgrade we expect others to not out bid them, as with piercers and rogues, or 2h weapons to knights. armor on the other hand alwayas goes high since more classes are usually listed as usable, in some cases all melee classes will be on the same piece of armor, or in the dreaded cases of all/all armor with a great mix of stats, the necklace off VZ(tactics) comes to mind, and is still a hot item in my guild due to the fact that jsut about everyone can use it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gerald</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">We have a pure bidding system. We earn points for every boss killing we attend. Most raids are worth 2 points. Some big raids (gods) are worth 5. We kill anywhere from 1-8 mobs a night (depends on what's up of course). Items are usually started off at a minimum bid appropriate for the item. Weapons are the same way. Because it's an auction type system, at one raid a weapon could go for 150 points then at the next 230 (this happened to me unfortunately). Usually though the first time something drops it goes for its highest amount. Each raid after that where item drops it usually goes for less but there are exceptions. It usually pays to be patient, but you can only be so patient in the end before getting the itch to spend points. This is the best points system in my opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Jedediah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Ours is like Gerald's, though with fewer points awarded, and therefore fewer points spent.<br />
<br />
1 RP per mob, with modifiers (x2 if it's our first try on a new mob, x0.5 if we zerg it, etc.).  Open bidding system, with minimum prices set by item stats (anything worth upgrading anymore starts at 10RP).</div></div><hr />

Why put a minimum point value in a pure-bid DKP system?<br />
