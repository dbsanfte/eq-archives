<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xarim</div><div class="date">08-20-2003, 01:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am level 57 Barbarian, Rallos Zek loving warrior. I need a bit of an upgrade because now I am tanking for PoV and PoS and such. Was wondering if anyone can give me some ideas of what areas need improvement etc etc. More hp/ac is what I am looking for. The rest of my stats i can buff to 255 with np. Magelo profile is on the left of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">08-20-2003, 03:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looking pretty good to me.<br />
<br />
The first thing I would do is ditch your two existing wrist slots in favor of two Fierce Heraldic Bracers (http://www.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=12356).  That would boost your AC quite considerably as well as add some HP.  Not to mention, the added saves from both items combined are priceless.  <br />
<br />
Second thing I would do is start saving for Kizrak's Armband of Battle (http://www.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=17890).  That would more than double both the AC and HP gained in that slot over the Hardened Grey Flesh Sleeves.  <br />
<br />
Get rid of the Shortblade of Lightning in favor of a Copper Hammer of Striking (http://www.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=22010).  The agro gained from this weapon should be doublefold, if not triplefold, over what's in that slot now.  You might lose STA at the outset, but just remember a shaman can buff stamina quite considerably.<br />
<br />
I'm quite biased when I say this, but you would thank me in the lost run.  Go and quest the Loyalist Shield of Honor (http://www.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=15971).  A 50ac/75hp backslot item is damn near priceless considering PoP mob damage output scales according to AC.  If you're going to be entering NToV any time soon, then a Cloak of Thorns (http://www.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=6423) off Lady Nevedaria may be something you will want to cross your fingers for instead.  However, if you're not, the shield is attainable with less than two groups with rougly 1-3 days worth of work.  It's really bloody easy actually.<br />
<br />
Lastly, work your faction and buy a Gauntlets of the Myrmidon (http://www.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=5550)  MQ.  Those gaunts are about as good as you'll ever get until you can get your hands on Gauntlets of Dragon Slaying, which involves killing Lord Yelinak.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xarim</div><div class="date">08-20-2003, 03:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had to update my Magelo, cause I just got a CHoS and WWhB and replaced the bracer of fortitude with a new bracer. Might have been the fierce heraldric bracer that I bought. As for the hardened sleeves, I have been looking for a replacement for awhile, but hadn't thought of the Kizrak's armband. Guess if I hold out I will eventually get the armband, now that I have my BoT key, just gotta get the tower keys and I am good to go. As for the back item, I have been trying to find a replacement for hat as well. And what should I do about my shoulders? Those chokidai i really need to replace, the AC is killing me on those. Thx for the tips as well.</div></div><hr />

He drops an excellent set of Horn Spiked Shoulder Plates (http://www.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=16470).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khazzuz</div><div class="date">08-20-2003, 09:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Or for something easier go quest the Draconic Pauldrons.  You will lose HP with those, however, not many upgrades on that slot where you won't.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No tower key needed for the armband, it drops in the north wing off Elif, he's easy and up a lot (20 minutes with PH i think).<br />
<br />
If you dont have any luck with that the FH arms aren't bad until you can get the ornate.</div></div><hr />
