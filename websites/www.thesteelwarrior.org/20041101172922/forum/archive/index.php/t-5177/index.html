<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Reyd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello everyone. I have been away from everquest for a year. I play a lv 54 Dwarf Warrior. My question is: When I left a year ago people were saying buy a GSoT at any cost-they are worth it. On my server (Vazealle) they were selling for 20kpp back then. I logged in this weekend and found 10 of them for 50pp each in the Bazaar. I of course bought one but was wondering why they are so cheap? Is the GSoT a worthless weapon now? I cant use it untill I get to lv 55 anyway!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>shadowedspawn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">From what I have noticed on Emarr they are a pretty common drop and the market has alot of them atm.  I am still trying to push my war through 54 so he can use the one i have in the bank 8D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Klozz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Exactly, the market simply became saturated with GSoT's.  Everyone has one now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It has to be the best value/cost item in the game.<br />
<br />
Its a godsend for any 55+ warrior coming back to the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">They upped the drop rate dramatically about 6-10 months ago and the price dropped from 20k to 500 pp in a matter of days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Still a great weapon, the market is just flooded with them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zynth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">opening up tier3 zones to lvl 62+ also made this weapon more available, as well as the increased drop rate mentioned before. also the fact that it comes from the best/most popular camp in BoT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">heh i paid 40k for mine just a few weeks before they nerfed the drop rates and even then i thought it was a sweet deal. so for 50pp, its practically the bargain of the century. slap an anger 3 proc on it and uve got a MT weapon that can last a long long time.<br />
<br />
heck when i switched servers recently before they allowed equipment moves first thing i bought was a GSoT and tanked nameds in pofire without any significant problems. and thats with a bunch of warriors in the guild all carrying auged bows....<br />
<br />
dont get me wrong not saying its the equivalent or anywhere near an auged bow, but its a damn fine weapon in its own right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">other then being common as dirt not much better on the market, and defintly nothing better in the price range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>ThornyEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I bought my first one for 32Kpp; the second one (for my wife's warrior) for 3Kpp, and a third one, for a warrior I was bringing up on another account, for 39pp. In all cases, even when I paid 32Kpp for it, I felt (and still feel) I got my money's worth.<br />
<br />
The GSoT is a great weapon that just happens to be common as dirt these days. It is literally the &quot;door prize&quot; a warrior gets for reaching level 55.<br />
<br />
Buy it, use it, don't regret it for a minute. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gharghael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Back when I was 60 and wielding pieces of ass like the Spiked Velium Mallet and Club of the Ice Ocean vs. PoV dillos, this 65 Warrior showed me his GSoT. I was like &quot;omg l33t .oO(but i'll never get it /cry).&quot; I immediately went and bought one for about 200pp if I remember correctly. That weapon is definitely not worthless. (Thanks Govno) It was a major upgrade in aggro AND dps. I DW a GBoS+CHoS for aggro now, but I still use the GSoT occasionally for DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">yeah i searched the bazaar for 2 days for mine, then payed 32k for mine. thought i got a great deal, it really was quite a good weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">garghael, im not sure what aaxp you have for offensive aas, but to be honest ive parsed the CHoS/SBoL combo vs the GSoT for DPS and the DW combo was only a couple of DPS short of the GSoT. your CHoS /GBoS would certainly be better, so unless you have ambi etc, then its not a dead cert that the GSoT is better dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Cherak Irongrip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">as silly as this weapon looks i still use it for xp/ldon groups <br />
unaugged it does better agro than my dw set up augged lol</div></div><hr />
