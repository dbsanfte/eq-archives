<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Drunken Mick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Giving advice to a high 40's low 50's group of friends on weps for their MT.<br />
<br />
Throwing out no-drop weps.  What is reasonably acquirable by a low 50's group?  Cash is available in some quantity.<br />
<br />
My initial suggestion was barnacle axe and frosty.  Perhaps Wavecrasher (not sure when it procs).<br />
<br />
Thoughts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tappy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I am pretty sure Wavy procs at level 50.<br />
Wvecrasher primary hand and Frosty off hand is solid agro for that level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Neksnappa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Okay, first off- the Wavy procs at level 1, so that would work for them.<br />
<br />
If they are mostly low or mid 50s, and are pretty well equipped and good players, they *might* be able to farm CHoS and SotBS in droga, but it will be pretty tough.<br />
<br />
Once the MT gets to be 55, a Greatstaff of Thunder would be a safe bet, and would cost under 500pp.<br />
<br />
Also; they could just do LDoN, and have the MT buy a lifetap or anger augment, and turn any high dps weapon into an aggro weapon as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Drunken Mick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Any ideas how much wavy's go for?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Wavecrasher sucks, and it costs too much. Stay away, stay far away</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Neksnappa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Aye, I would steer clear of a wavy if you can. On the nameless server at least, they seem to go for 10kish, although I havent been on in a week, so it might be off. If you were thinking of buying a wavecrasher, just get a Sword of the Bloodsworn or Copper Hammer of Striking, both of which will do more damage, give you better stats, and have a more useful proc (0 sec stun + dd).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Barja Bardagi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Honed Blade of the Ykesha would be good, or if they're a Rallos Follower, Vengeful Honed Blade of the Ykesha.  Plus, if they put their time in at LDoN you could add a lower-end anger aug to them and end up with some weapons that could take them a good ways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Qaladar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Wavecrasher is so expensive because as mentioned it procs even at level 1. It makes a sickeningly good twink weapon as the effect is 20hp a tick dot for 1 minute in addition to the slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Try crawling through Droga, see if you can handle the mobs there, and camp the hammer on your own.<br />
<br />
Or ... grind the warrior to 55 and spend a couple hundred plat on a GSoT and never look back.<br />
<br />
:-)<br />
<br />
Good luck. Have fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Copper Hammer, Sword of the Bloodsworn.  Don't waste your time with lesser things.  You probably can't camp them at that level, but they shouldn't be terribly expensive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">For the price of a WC and a Frosty, you have about 3/4 of the price of a Copper hammer+SotB. Save a few more plats and get those weapons instead. Also pick up the deal of the century and get a GSoT for when you hit 55. That should hold you over for another 10+ levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Bonequest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Before you farm LDoN to get anger procs, consider this:<br />
<br />
At level 50 you will not get very many points per adventure.  It would be more efficient to level closer to 60 and then do adventures if you need those proc augs.  Just to put it in perspective, I get 51 points for a regular adventure at 65 and on my 41 ranger I get like 3 or 4 points.  Anger 2 is a 400 hate aug and is like 510 LDoN points at Everfrost.  Anger 3 is 1150 points.  If you are around level 50, I think you probably would get like 15 to 20 points per adventure if that and it would take two to three times as many sucessful adventures to buy the same item that a level 65 would need.  The difference in time spent would be much better spent on leveling and would bring far more benefit to your character.  It is much more time efficient to level first and then get those augs.  <br />
<br />
Same for the equipment, at 65 you will spend far less time and get much better equipment per time spent on adventures than you would at 50.  A level 50 would probably level up to close to 65 before he got enough points to buy some of the nice Tak armor anyway, just from the experience that the adventures would give him but he could level 2 or 3 times faster in PoP and still get the armor faster in the long run by waiting until level 65 to do the adventures.</div></div><hr />
