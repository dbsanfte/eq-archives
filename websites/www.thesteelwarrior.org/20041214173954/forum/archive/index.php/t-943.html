<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wilhelmm_Lanys</div><div class="date">06-01-2003, 12:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">With the resurgance of posts about warrior agro, more and more hybrids from both knight classes have come here to express their opinion. Aside from the usual &quot;you have defensive&quot; &quot;you have raid role and we don't (false btw)&quot; and the exagerated notions of our HP, AC, and mitigation advantages (which we don't have, but not the point). These reactions are nothing new. However, as of late, there has been a whole new wave of people saying &quot;You want our agro abilities, we want defensive,&quot; or &quot;you getting our agro abilities will kill our classes or trivialize the game&quot; These are the people this post is directed at, you know who you are, I don't feel like quoting everyone of your posts.<br />
<br />
<br />
My point is simple. Sensible warriors here &quot;do not want the same agro abilities as you&quot;. We don't, really. We want improvements in our agro abilities, but if you notice, none of them are still even remotely close to bringing us to your level of agro generation. If you haven't realized, there is a massive gap between warriors and knights in terms of agro (I group paladins and SKs together here because I know while SK's are slightly better in this, they are both FAR above warriors now). And, there are plenty of ways to fix agro and narrow the gap, some of which you've seen mentioned on these boards, that would improve our abilities noticeably without treading on your territory.<br />
<br />
Let me repeat, sensible warriors here don't want the agro abilities of knights, and most of the posters here are indeed sensible. Most of us feel your agro, especially on the paladin side, since  SK's were designed to be agro magnets, is much too powerful. we don't want the ability to gain agro at will in any scenario under any circumstances, because that indeed would be game-breaking. No, most just want the ability to pull agro off a slower or CHer in an XP group, if done properly (and don't tell me thats easy to do now, or even possible because thats BS considering how often taunt fails). <br />
<br />
Think of it as a figmented scale. Going low low to high, imagine SK's are 105, Paladins are 100, and warriors are 50 on a scale of the agro abilities of either class, respectively. If warriors got a boost, and went up to 65 or 75 on the scale, we receive improvements, but are still not treading on the abilities of either class. I know, some will respond &quot;well, if you get agro abilities to bring you closer to our abilities, we want fixes to bring us closer to you.&quot; To that response, I would say, how much closer do you wish to get? We already share similar defensive and offensive tables (tables, not skillcaps). With every expansion, the HP and AC differences become gradually smaller, especially with the introduction of paladin or SK-only spells. Even DPS gaps become narrower with the introduction of more and more great knight weapons into the end-game. The lone feature we have left is defensive, our 3-year old bandaid for not having separate mitigation tables, that is really over-rated and not frequently used in XP groups.<br />
<br />
Think about it before posting; we want agro improvements, but not your agro.</div></div><hr />

That Paladins or Shadow Knight may get a group over a Warrior at some times in some cases is not a concern.  What is a concern is when Paladins and Shadow Knights are consistantly getting groups over Warriors almost universally.  Just as the Knights didn't enjoy the Kunark era, Warriors aren't enjoying the PoP era.</div></div><hr />

I personally don't want to see Knight aggro get knocked down and brought toward the warrior, and I don't want to be brought up to their level of aggro. All that's needed is a slight boost in our aggro and a slight boost in our defensive abilities so that Knights are not the obvious choice for an exp group, but still a good choice. In no way should Knights be nerfed to fix this problem. /nod</div></div><hr />

Defensive lower the damage taken, but also lower the damage dealt.<br />
A knight version of defensive should have the same effect, but spells should be taken into the calculation too. Maybe a doubled cast time would make it somewhat equal.<br />
<br />
I am not talking about giving defensive to knights!<br />
I am trying to give a picture of what defensive would be like for a knight, so people can understand it better.</div></div><hr />

Last night I grouped with a paladin for exp.  I have MORE hp than he does.  I have EB procs.<br />
<br />
The druid asked him to tank, because despite my raid caliber weapons, he had better agro.<br />
<br />
In a balanced world, this should never happen. Thats all I ask - is that warriors be the PREFERRED tank... not the ONLY tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jaxxym</div><div class="date">06-01-2003, 04:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I continue to think that leaving warrior aggro and pally aggro alone, and simply making pally aggro more expensive in terms of mana would make the most sense. <br />
<br />
This offers groups a clear tradeoff: great aggro (pally) = more downtime for medding, OR higher risk (war) = consistent xps over time with less downtime. Since xp is what it's all about in the problematic scenarios we are discussing (tier 2+ xps groups), more skilled groups (including chanters who actually know how to manage their aggro) can use a warrior with very low risk. <br />
<br />
Chanters who have never learned how to properly manage aggro (and there are loads of these out there), and who are the main problem in my experience in terms of demanding pallies instead of warriors, can still choose pallies, only this way they will not be rewarded for not learning an important skill. But they won't be overly penalized either since the xp rate for either type of group should net out pretty close. <br />
<br />
Additionally, this would cease what is in effect a penalty against those of us who like some challenge and risk in our game play, because it sharpens our skills, in my view. And it also does not overpower the warrior class simply in response to an already overpowered pally aggro ability. <br />
<br />
Bottom line, I don't want warriors to be broken like pallies are now broken, even though this break would be in our favor, as it is currently for pallies.<br />
<br />
Is this a nerf? It all depends on your definition, I guess. I think it's a reasonable way to address the pally/war snap aggro imbalance that the vast majority of class boards, including this one, seem to have reached a consensus on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">06-01-2003, 04:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am in the camp that does not want more warrior agro, but instead lesser knight agro.  That said, I like what you are saying.  We(no matter how you want to fix the agro divide) do not want to see knights unable to get groups again.  We want a solution that is fair, that leaves all 3 plate tank classes at about even desirability in exp groups, and improves the game overall(or at least does not further break it).</div></div><hr />

Then the druid and Pally both don't know how to play.  Knight aggro doesnt need a nerf because those two noobs know nothing about start aggro aka piggy-back aggro.  It should have been a chance for you to teach them how to do that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">06-01-2003, 05:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's also the point, Synapticus, that most people see the agro difference as far out-weighing the tanking difference.  That's a problem, the decision should never be easy between a warrior and a knight, IMHO.  There should be a reason to want to have the warrior OVER the knights...right now there is none.  Whether it be something a warrior can benefit the group with, or how the hybrid tank must use more mana than he can normally regen with current mana regen spells to &quot;lock&quot; the agro.  It's already mostly this way for SKs, why can't it be that way for paladins?<br />
<br />
Although, considering the hell paladins raised when SOE wanted to add a downside to their slay undead, I'm wondering how big of a hell they'll raise over something like this.  Hmmm...better get my popcorn, would be an interesting sight.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think many Paladins (I know not all) would agree with your post.  On the flip side, there would need to be a mitigation scale (I won't even hazard that one) and a dps scale (even though dps really does not matter for a tank class).  And all three classes should be balanced to meet these three scales.<br />
<br />
If a knight and a warrior are in the same group - why the hell would the paladin not want to transfer the aggro to the warrior?  Dumbass pride would be my guess.  Paladin take initial aggro and then lets the warrior take the majority of the beating - solid teamwork in play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mofu-Troll</div><div class="date">06-01-2003, 07:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">/agree cuedyan2  , the same thing i have been saying in other threads . <br />
<br />
 Why does it have to be one or the other? When just as cuedyan has said the smartest way to handle hard hitting mobs would be for the knight to handle early aggro while the mob is debuffed , then they lay off the aggro and let the warrior take it for the rest of the way .<br />
<br />
Mofu<br />
<br />
PS forgot to mention that for this to be a viable strat , the warrior has to be clearly better at the tanking role , possibly a slightly better mitigation table needed for warriors imo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Was going to say that mitigation table might not be the answer - then realised it probably is.  SOE uses itemization too often to fix classes.  Look at Knights weapon choices - if they wanted knights to do more damage they should have just upped our skill caps - not given weapons that cause some class envy.<br />
<br />
I truly believe all weapons/armor should be about the same between tank classes.  What logical excuse can they make for having items better for certain classes?  A master craftsman probably could care less if the item is going to a warrior, a paladin, a shadowknight, or even a cleric.  The difference should be in the training.  <br />
<br />
So, yes I do agree in hindsight that warriors should be on a seperate mitigation table - followed by the knight classes.  Or, have a higher skill cap.  Itemization is probably one area that has totally hosed this game.</div></div><hr />

Sooo, you'd toss out your SK/Paladin friend or guildy out of a group you were in just to maximise DPS? <br />
I've been in many two tank groups, and the group didn't suffer for it. ;p</div></div><hr />

FD pull and slow makes mobs trivial. Only warriors have to group, the casters I group with would leave the group rather than suffer a huge exp loss. They are all &quot;leet power gamers&quot; only interested in AA's as fast as possible. That attitude further encouraged because the leet power guilds only take those with 200+ AA's.<br />
Get with it, these casters hit the fast exp zones, soloed to the levels they are at, and have no interest except helping themselves.<br />
BTW, why does an SK get to hit big mobs with just a shaman? Because FD pulling is BS crap that Sony would love to nerf but can't. He doesn't need anyone else because SK has been moved so close to warrior in melee ability it hardly matters, Shaman can slow IMMEDIATELY because of his SK's leet aggro control. Slowing BEFORE mob arrival at camp is better than warrior hp advantage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You don't help ANYTHING by calling for another class to get nerfed.  Period.  All you do is piss those people off so they come here and make 5,000 threads about one thing:  your stupid crusade to get them nerfed.<br />
<br />
As has been said many times, if you're not part of the solution, you're part of the problem.  You, sir, are not part of the solution.<br />
<br />
Now, on to the topic at hand.  Increasing mana cost is not an effective solution, unless you increase the cost of the given spells to a point at which they are all but useless.  With AA, Buffs, and FT, mana is well-nigh infinite in many situations.  We most definitely don't want to make any more spells completely useless, so we can't go that way, right?<br />
<br />
Now...the biggest difference between warriors and knights, as the game stands right now, is aggro lock.  However, without changing spell mana cost (see above), or upgrading taunt to a point where it breaks the game, it's difficult to close that gap a reasonable amount.  A complete, well-balanced solution, at this point in the game, is probably a pipe dream.<br />
<br />
Itemization will *always* be a problem, in any long-lasting MMORPG, whether we like it or not.  When a game is originally released, the top items are great....then an expansion comes out, so the top items become better...and on and on.  It's a fact of life, for gamers that play MMORPGs...completely unavoidable, unless content doesn't become any more challenging...and then what's the point?<br />
<br />
How would *I* fix this disparity, if I were in charge?  I'd tweak class mitigation tables, first.  This is something that's needed doing for a long time...it's the easiest, most obvoius solution to the problem introduced with itemization.  Second, a small tweak to taunt would be in order...maybe make the Hate list decay faster, thus making hate easier to come by for DWing warriors (most of us still DW, after all, and the high end [read: EB and beyond] warriors don't have as much of a problem with aggro, ime)...maybe decrease the fail rate on taunt just a tad...it seems like it works ok now, but could use a *little* boost.<br />
<br />
Finally, a little relation of experience...recently, I had a situation much like the one Aldarion described.  I joined a group, the paladin was tanking.  I DW Bloodfrenzy and a Blade of Carnage...generally I have very little trouble holding aggro.  I buff out to ~8300hp, this paladin was set at 6200, fully buffed.  The group wanted him to tank, and I didn't argue...and I didn't change my weapons, either...I kept DWing (my 2-hander sucks hardcore) EB weps, and aggro never flinched, for even a second, off this paladin.  Yes, the cleric had to heal him more.  No, the cleric never even got *close* to oom.  With KEI, SD, and FT5, mana wasn't a question...he got to 60m once, when we pulled 3 mobs while the chanter was LD.<br />
<br />
I had 2100 more hp.  I was dual wielding EB.  The group was more efficient with the paladin tanking.  Without a question.  Is this right?  In my opinion, no, not at all.<br />

If you already have a tank that can aggro well in a group, why would you want to transfer it to any another tank ? get a Damage dealer instead of a warrior, your mob will die quick, with the added utility of the class you choose.<br />
And don't tell me &quot;because the warrior mitigate better&quot;, because any paladin that can't tank have nothing to in a pop xp group.<br />
<br />
Also the problem is a warrior one... paladins always aggroed better, they should not nerf it now. Also I don't thing raising our aggro to the same level is the solution, tanks classes need to be differents.</div></div><hr />

It's not like EverQuest is really that hard.  It's also pretty obvious that Knight aggro is completely out of whack so it's safe to predict they'll get nerfed.<br />
<br />
Sony is willing to let something overpowered but not game breaking (and yes, Knight aggro is not game breaking even though it sure is very annoying for Warriors) go on while they're coming up with a fix.  Charm is a good example.  Anyone could've tell it was overpowered, but instead of slapping some easy crippling fix (charmed mob don't give xp would do it), they let Enchanters have full reign with their Charm while they work out a reasonable solution.  The Hybrid aggro problem is similar.  It'd be unimaginable that Sony doesn't know something is wrong, but they're willing to let Hybrids enjoy it a bit more while they work out a good solution.  It'd be trivial to fix this problem overnight.  Just slap a negative hate component on all SK/Paladin spells that produce more aggro than it should (Darkness and Stuns being the major ones) and problem solved, and it'd also make a lot of people mad, and probably hurt the Hybrids too much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaldanm</div><div class="date">06-02-2003, 05:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really think knight aggro should NOT be nerfed.<br />
Because they always aggroed better than us, it's a part of the class fun. <br />
I have come to think that taunt is no Broken.  In fact we use it all the time, and except rare case of bad luck it work most of the time. The thing is that SOE should not change the way aggro work between the 3 tank classes, but work on other aspects. tweaking spells for knights, tweaking mitigation for warriors.<br />
<br />
What was the problem ? finding groups ? every class should be attractive. let pally and sk have their awesome aggro generation, but give us something that may make us a little wanted in groups. in old times we had crits, it was candyeye but it was a good image of the warrior...<br />
Perception is important. We may mitigate better than knights, and do 20 more DPS than the other tanks, as long as casters and healers think a random warrior may suck compared to a random knight, there is a problem.<br />
We need something other than knight aggro (that is just class envy). However I think tweaking mitigation is tricky, it may imbalance all previous content. so since I don't know what is needed, I'll let SOE think about something... I just hope the guy who designed the rathe event is not the one in charge of warriors :D.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not that I disagree with your basic logic, I just happen to think that a company that would ignore a significant detrimental (and I consider the changes that PoP generated as significant and detrimental) impact to an entire class for 9 months is just fekked up.  The fact that chanters could charm solo in an obscene fashion didn't directly exclude an entire class from being welcome for grouping.  Letting that go had LESS impact.</div></div><hr />

In the next month or so we will be implementing some changes designed to bring more fun back into the game.  Our experience with Planes of Power has taught us a lot about what we did right and what we should avoid in the future.  Building an online game like EverQuest offers us the unique opportunity to see how customers react to our ideas and to adjust them if needed.  We'll be taking the opportunity to put some of our experience to work to improve the play experience in EverQuest.<br />
<br />
1)      Partial Zone Revamps.<br />
These consist of improvements in the experience gain, monster density and/or item rewards in some of the older zones.  The goal is to improve the playability and reward for adventuring in these zones without completely remaking the contents of the zone.  We plan to do several of these, and we'll keep you updated as we move through these.  Currently we are working on a partial revamp of Veeshan's Peak.<br />
<br />
2)      Experience Range Adjustment.<br />
When Planes of Power was released and the level cap was raised from 60 to 65, the range of NPCs that characters in the new levels could kill to gain experience was smaller than it is for characters of lower levels.  This was done to encourage characters to fight more challenging enemies and allowed us to increase the experience reward given for that increased challenge.  Unfortunately, this has limited the locations available to 61+ level characters for experience gain, as well as making it more difficult for solo players to gain experience.<br />
This is something that we don't like, and it has had a negative affect on the &quot;fun factor&quot; involved in playing in Planes of Power.  To correct this, we will be increasing the level range of NPCs that will give 61+ level characters experience.  They will have approximately the same range of NPCs available to them as they did at level 60, and should be able to gain experience in some of their old hunting grounds, as well as in Planes of Power zones.<br />
<br />
3)      Planar Progression.<br />
Planes of Power has provided us with valuable insight into the group and guild dynamics that are involved in large scale games.  The way that we had expected guilds to advance through the story of Planes of Power has become a roadblock for some guilds, and some members have fallen behind and found it difficult to catch up.  Obviously this was not our intention.  We want players to play with their friends and guild mates.<br />
To correct this issue, we will be removing the flag requirements for entry into the following Planes of Power zones:<br />
Bastion of Thunder<br />
Plane of Tactics<br />
Halls of Honor<br />
Plane of Nightmare<br />
Plane of Storms<br />
Plane of Torment<br />
Plane of Valor<br />
Crypt of Decay<br />
This will make the majority of Planes of Power zones available to everyone, and should allow most guilds to travel and adventure together.  We understand that those that have already earned the entry flags for these zones have put some effort into that accomplishment.  We will be giving a reward to those that have done so,  though you'll have to wait to see what that reward is.<br />
<br />
4)      Items in the Planes of Power<br />
We will be looking at the quality of Planes of Power item rewards and improving them where appropriate.  Items for many of the lower tier gods will be upgraded and more rare items and NPCs will be added to the following zones as needed:<br />
Crypt of Decay<br />
Plane of Torment<br />
Halls of Honor<br />
Plane of Tactics<br />
Plane of Innovation<br />
Bastion of Thunder<br />
<br />
5)      Class Balance<br />
We are going to look at improving the damage capabilities of melee classes, as they've fallen behind their magic-using counterparts at the very high end of the game.  Some options being considered are:<br />
Improve melee damage-increasing disciplines <br />
Improve Planes of Power melee weapons <br />
Additionally, we're looking at the concerns from players about their spells, and changing them where appropriate.  The goal here is to remove annoying issues with spells, not necessarily to increase caster power overall.<br />
<br />

<br />
So as you see, class balance come in last... it seems they proceed in the order they writen this thing, And of course, the &quot;a month or so&quot; is calculed with same tools as the estimated downtimes of 2 hours that last 8 :p.<br />
<br />
It seems they work on things that affect the whole player base, not just melees. melee balance is the thing they'll do someday if they're bored of adding new stuff to UIs, maybe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My wife is a cleric and I'm a war.  <br />
<br />
She likes pallies cause she can heal one person in the group.  She does not like me (in game) because she has to heal both me and the slower quite often.<br />
<br />
Having two tanks causes the same problem.  If a pally was taking snap aggro, my wife would give me shit if I took it away from him at a later time... she would likely claim I was wasting her healing mana and causing her to heal two people instead of one (target changes, casting time, and mana).<br />
<br />
The most efficient heal is a complete heal.  I think its 400 mana spent for ~7K+ hp heal.  If we divide that damage in two, she cannot maximize her healing efficiency, which negates her ability to contribute to the group in other ways.  (i.e. nuke, stun, reverse DS, etc).  These other contributions mitigate damage since the mobs die faster.</div></div><hr />

Stupidest thing I ever heard! Do you have ANY idea of the DPS difference between tanks and casters? Why would any SENSIBLE exp group have two people tanking? You want ONE tank, ONE, got it now?! DPS is horrendous compared to a caster with FT, KEI, and AA's. Stop that stupid crap of two tanks is even remotely desired in a group, thats just plain idiotic.<br />
<br />
Actually this is one of the stupidest and idiotic statements ive ever heard.  There are many advantages to having both Warrior and Paladin in a group.  If both learn to work well together then its non-stop EXP for the group.  I group regulary with a level 60 Paladin and several people including non-group mates have commented on how efficient and effective we are despite our &quot;lower dps&quot;.  <br />
<br />
The more and more I read all these threads about Warrior -vs- Knight i begin to realize that the real problem seems to be with the player base and not the classes themselves.  The &quot;my dick is bigger than yours&quot; attitude  (both sides are guilty) has lead us to thinking that Warriors and Hybrids are mutually exclusive when in fact they were perhaps meant to work together :)<br />
<br />
As for the original statement in the thread, I agree 100%.. I do not want anykind of Knight nerf nor do I want god-like aggro.  I just want some long needed upgrades so that I don't feel so out-classed in terms of aggro/tanking. :)</div></div><hr />

Replace the second by a mage for exemple, you got an awesome DPS + a damage shield, added to all the pets advantages. it's just an exemple of who bring what if you add him. I never shared tanking... instead of doing A, you are doing A + B...<br />
<br />
I agree that paladins may stun on inc and then you start to tank it while it slowed... but you can do the same with any rooter / stunner... Beside if your group know to play, and you take a few unslowed hits, there's no need of this ghetto trick.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If the game was meant to be Tank/aggro magnet/healer/dps/dps<br />
There would be more than tanking class with low aggro ( monks don't count ) and the aggro classes would have much lower defense power ( Just higher than a clerics as opposed to the second best in the game ). <br />
<br />
It would take something like knights loosing a great deal of their aggro, monks/rangers/(rogues?) lost defense  generating more aggro to become the &quot;aggro magnets&quot;,  and the other dps classes getting the solo game taken out from under them.<br />

When using an Enchanter and Charm Tanking. It is always nice to have that extra tank to grab that charmed pet when charm breaks. Saddly this is where snap-instant aggro is EVEN more important. So this now makes a spot for 2 Paladins, or a Pal/SK combo as ideal....</div></div><hr />

Probably true, but like I have mentioned in several other threads I'm a very casual player and for the most part consider myself a noob when it comes to higher end encounters.  I only EXP with friends and hardly ever raid.  My group uses a Druid for healer and having the Paladin there for added healing and for emergency split tanking as proven to be quite effective.</div></div><hr />

On the other note why would you have both kinght and warrior in same group. If you have doting classes then split tanking can add troumendous boost to groups dps.</div></div><hr />

This is on PoS and BoT mobs mostly. I do not want his aggro abilities at all but it just to crazy that he can cast one spell and go on auto attack the rest of the time and never miss a beat. Even our SK buddy has trouble getting aggro off him and that is with just one spell cast and all of us in comperable gear and all 64-65 lvl, SK and Palli both being 65. I just can't see how that is not just an obvious problem.

Paladins and SKs had MUCH less hps and MUCH inferior mitigation tables and skill caps.

In addition they have stuns and heals to make up and in most cases surpass our slight avoidance advantage.  <br />

One or the other has to give.  Either give us back a significant mitigation advantage so there is a tradeoff to such a huge aggro gap, or give us similar aggro and leave tanking efficiency essentially equal.</div></div><hr />

It's not a FACT. Thats the problem. You would think after seeing multiple warriors disagreeing with you, combined with the fact that you have zero evidence to support your claim, I think you'd take a hint. Apparently not. <br />
<br />
AA's don't change defensive tables. The fact remains, warriors and knights share the same defensive mitigation and avoidance TABLES. Warriors have higher skill CAPS, but the same TABLES. This has been the case for more than two years now.<br />
<br />
Warriors having a higher mitigation TABLES is not a fact, but your false opinion, expressed for reasons I still cannot understand.</div></div><hr />

OK, Pino, then you should have ZERO problem supplying us a qoute then. Just one out of the several will suffice.<br />

<br />
In a lame attempt to quiet the knights' whining (somewhat similar to our current whining about our sorry state - see if that gets me flamed ;-) a while back, the knights were moved to the warrior mitigation TABLES - i.e. the lookup tables used inside the code to determine hit dmg, as I understand it.<br />
<br />
I am gonna go out on a limb here and suggest that perhaps what pino *meant* to say is that SOE has stated that warrior mitigation is still superior to knights. Using the term 'tables' (as in LUTs in the code) was probably not what he *meant*. <br />
<br />
But the way that SOE accomplished this (alleged) superior mitigation was via itemization, not by having warriors on a different mitigation TABLE (which is how it used to be). At least, that's been my take. <br />
<br />
Maybe that's what caused the confusion here. Maybe not. In any event, that's my effort to get the discussion back on track.<br />
<br />
Now, have at you!</div></div><hr />

However, they've also said Knights are on the same mitigation table.  Therefore it's easy to conclude that barring better gear a Warrior will mitigate identically to a Knight and the only difference beyond gear is the small avoidance difference due to increased skills.  Having the same mitigation as Knights can still mean having the best mitigation, we just share it with two other classes.<br />
<br />
Sorry Pino, but Knights don't mitigate worse than Warriors.</div></div><hr />

What sets the actual tanking abilities of each class apart are avoidance skills, AC on armor sets (IE: Kael, Skyshrine, or Thurgadin), and innate hit points.  <br />
<br />
AC per AC though, I'm pretty sure a warrior with 1200ac will mitigate identically to a cleric with 1200ac.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're absolutely correct.  This has been shown time and time again to be the case, that defensive mitigation tables (at least between plate classes) are 100% identical, clerics ran a great thread showing that at identical AC levels there was no difference in mitigation between warriors and clerics, but the avoidance difference made a HUGE difference (as there's a huge avoidance difference).  It was never &quot;changed&quot; though.<br />
<br />
What was changed during the infamous &quot;class balancing&quot; was that Knights were moved to the same defense skill as warriors.  Identical Skill level.  It really didn't have anything to do with tables.<br />
<br />
What DID happen with &quot;tables&quot; which may have gotten some people confused was on offensive tables... It used to be that from 50-60 warriors and monks were on the same offensive table, and while monks had special kicks, it wasn't enough of a spread to VI (at the time it was VI and not SOE, all you bastards who stop a conversation to say 'it's not VI any more gee aren't I smart?' can go to hell along with 'spiders aren't insects' and 'dolphins are mammals') liking, as warriors had triple attack and were on the same offensive table as monks, so they moved monks to a separate offensive table and left warriors where they were, but then they took Knights and Rangers and put them on the Warrior offensive table.   Ergo... 4 classes increased while we remained stagnant.   Gay</div></div><hr />

At the same numerical AC the cleric and warrior mitigated about the same, with the warrior mitigating slightly better. The catch was that the cleric actually had far more mitigation AC than the warrior did. More of the warrior's total AC was made up of avoidance AC due to a higher defensive skill. Despite that, the warrior still mitigated slightly better.<br />
<br />
I distinctly remember a patch message during luclin that said warriors, paladins, and shadow knights were getting a small boost to mitigation. Whether this is any difference between the plate tank classes, I don't know. I would guess that if there is a difference it is very small.</div></div><hr />

You must remember, I don't buy into the myth of Mitigation AC/Avoidance AC splits solely based on the fact that there was at one time during beta two different number and now there's one.<br />
<br />
There's never been, nor am I aware of any possible way to &quot;prove&quot; that there's a &quot;Mitigation/Avoidance&quot; AC split that's invisible.<br />
<br />
You're correct in that the warrior with the higher defensive skill had to don less AC gear than the cleric to acheive the same level of AC, but that's not a big deal, it's just as easy to underbuff the warrior and overbuff the cleric to compensate for AC differences.<br />
<br />
The warrior did indeed mitigate slightly better, but it was pretty much inside the margin of error for the test.<br />
<br />
The &quot;Plate class mitigation increase&quot; patch was the day of the monk &quot;nerf&quot;, but it equally affected all plate wearing classes (Including Clerics and Bards) if memory serves me correctly.</div></div><hr />

&quot;** Defensive Changes **<br />
<br />
- Decreased Monks' ability to mitigate damage (please see the Developer's Update for more details<br />
- Improved the ability of Paladins, Shadowknights, Warriors and Bards to mitigate damage in some situations<br />

<br />
I'd heard quite a bit of speculation around the time of the nerf that there weren't actually seperate tables between leather/chain/plate and the only real difference given the same ac would be defensive skills. Since the message above did specifically state that some plate classes would be able to mitigate better in certain situations I'm not sure if I buy it. Would be interesting to see some parses between a rogue and a warrior at the same ac levels for fun though. I've only been playing for about 2 years so don't have as much of the class-balance history as I should.<br />

regarding avoidance/mitigation:<br />
I don't buy into the myth of Mitigation AC/Avoidance AC splits solely based on the fact that there was at one time during beta two different number and now there's one.<br />
<br />
Neither do I. I base my opinion (or belief in the &quot;myth&quot;) on parses and on logic.  If 2 classes avoid attacks at different rates, what is the mechanism that causes them to do so? If 2 characters of different classes with identical numerical AC avoid differently AND mitigate differently, why is that?<br />
<br />
Go find a 60+ shaman and rogue with identical AC. Have them tank a mob until you have a sufficient sample size. Compare mitigation. Compare avoidance.<br />
<br />
Until and unless you have done that (or seen the results of similar tests that you trust) don't comment one way or the other. Saying &quot;I don't know&quot; is really the only valid answer, because guessing isn't knowledge.<br />

Two characters of equal level take hits over a period of time with identical AC, and count misses, and this shows how much AC is set aside for Avoidance vs. mitigation.   <br />
<br />
You go on to further say that the tables for mitigation have a lower requirement for classes with high defense then *because* the lower miss ratio and equal mitigation with identical AC is somehow &quot;proof&quot;?<br />
<br />
I'm sorry, but I don't buy it, for a few reasons...<br />
<br />
1. Combat Agility and Lightning reflexes has no bearing whatsoever on the AC number, and they fairly drastically affect the hit/miss calculation.<br />
<br />
When I'm looking at how programming is done, I like to think that programmers are savvy enough to figure out that adding a totally new step to a calculation is more of a drag on processing time than adjusting one.   This indicates to me that there's probably a factor involved in the hit/miss calculation that can be altered by training in CA and LR.   Adding additional layers is a real waste of resources.<br />
<br />
2. We know that there's combat mitigation tables which are calculated after the 'to hit' number has been determined.  They were changed for monks, and at the same time were changed for knights, warriors, and the more gentle plate class.    <br />
<br />
Combat Stability can be trained and it doesn't affect your AC one iota, although because SOE has said that they have an alterable combat mitigation table, altering that table individually upon training in CS/ID is easy.<br />
<br />
There's a couple more but they're based more on hunches, so I want to do some tests before commenting on them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are several things that strongly suggest that the displayed AC number is a composite.<br />
<br />
Firstly, naked AC. If a character takes off all armor, they still have a significant amount of AC, but essentially have no noticeable mitigation. On the other hand, a character will avoid hits with essentially the same frequency when they are naked as when they are fully geared. That displayed AC number when naked isn't mitigation, so what is it?<br />
<br />
Secondly, you can test the effects of that naked AC between 2 characters of the same class. If one of them has a much lower DEFENSE skill, they have a much lower displayed AC number when naked AND have a much lower avoidance rate. &lt;---FACT...this is known. Not a guess, not surmise. (It's easiest to test at low levels and shows the biggest difference.)<br />
<br />
Those 2 things alone make a very strong case that avoidance makes up part of the total displayed AC number. Once you extrapolate that out, you can do further testing like what I mentioned in the post above.<br />
<br />
EDIT: BTW, the easiest way to test is to make 2 druids. Get one KEI and have him level up to 35 or so by kiting or DoT/rooting. Basically, get him up in levels without ever getting a skillup in defense. Make another druid, get him hp buffs, and level him by porcupining. Druid 2 will have maxed defense skill for his level while druid 1 will have none. Now comes the testing. Test with druid 2 naked and give druid 1 enough raw AC to match the displayed AC of druid 2. Now go find a mob that is 1 level green and have them both tank that mob until you get a significant sample size. Look at the results. The conclusions will be obvious.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Again, you're still making the assumption that defense skill *only* adds AC, and nothing else that you cannot see, and that the AC that is added is what is measured to check the avoidance.   While it's indeed *possible* it's certainly not evidence.<br />
<br />
*Correllation does not mean causation*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Graal the Dorf</div><div class="date">06-05-2003, 04:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Let's assume the defense skill does things other than add AC for the moment. That doesn't change the basic argument. I don't care if higher defense skill makes your character move faster, sexier, and stop global warming...it doesn't change the measurable impact that the defense skill has on AC and avoidance. We CAN measure the impact it has on avoidance and it is patently obvious the impact it has on displayed AC.<br />
<br />
The assumption you are making is that is impossible to test whether displayed AC is a composite number, which is patently false.<br />
<br />
EDIT: I guess I should point out why.<br />
<br />
Take those 2 druids and have them both tank a mob that is 1 level green and have them do so naked. They will have very different displayed AC. They will have measurably different avoidance rates. Their mitigation will be essentially the same. If that disparity in displayed AC didn't cause the difference in avoidance, what did? If that disparity in displayed AC doesn't cause a change in mitigation, what DOES it do? What besides defense skill and AGI adds to naked displayed AC?<br />
<br />
Now add enough raw AC to the druid with no defense skill to bring his make his displayed AC equal to the druid with full defense. Have them tank the same mob again. How does their mitigation compare. How does their avoidance compare? <br />
<br />
As far as the defense skill possibly doing other things that are hidden, I can't show that it doesn't. That doesn't matter. I can show that increasing defense skill increases naked AC at a linear rate. I can also show that increasing defense skill improves avoidance. Ergo, AC is includes an avoidance portion. <br />
<br />
I can then add raw AC from items to increase displayed AC and test, which will show that AC includes a mitigation portion.<br />
<br />
I don't understand why that is so hard.</div></div><hr />

I realize that this sounds like nitpicking, and to an extent, it is... but you're still making the grievous err that correllation = causation.<br />
<br />
In your example.... and I think I may give this a shot just for fun on a weekend... Let me see if I have your hypothesis down pat.<br />
<br />
- A Naked Druid with Defensive Skills will have a higher AC value than one without (Simple enough, we can all agree on that unless we want to intentionally blind ourselves).<br />
<br />
- That naked druid will not mitigate any better than the one with the lower AC number (This I may disagree with, will need to test to see, my immediate hunch is that it's incorrect)<br />
<br />
- That same naked druid will be missed (not dodge, but a real *miss*) more often than the one with the lower defense skill (Again, something I agree with, but for different reasons).<br />
<br />
The proof will be in the pudding....<br />
<br />
- If you bring the low defensive skill druid up to the same AC as the high defensive skill one through equipment, it would naturally follow that the low defensive skill druid would mitigate better than the high defensive skill druid in order to be consistent, yes?<br />
<br />
Once we have agreement on establishing of results, I'll get on the tests this weekend.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When you end up equalizing the AC of the 2 characters and finding out that one of them mitigates much better and the other avoids much better with equal AC, it pretty much answers the question. They have the same displayed AC, but it comes from different sources and gives different effects.</div></div><hr />
