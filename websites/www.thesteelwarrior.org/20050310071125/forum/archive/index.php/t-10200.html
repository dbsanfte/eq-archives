Not only your system set up, but physically?  I used to box a war/cler using EWQ, but I can't fathom how you would box 6 toons.</div></div><hr />

Lots of assist and mem spell set type hotkeys.  Specific group ordering and lots of practice.  Moving around 6 people is the hardest part, once adjusted everything gets pretty rhythmic.  Additions like autofire and melody have made life 1000x easier.  The main thing is making sure things dont move around ie cast, follow, assist keys.</div></div><hr />

I have 1 hotkey on my cleric for CH, but the rest of the characters I just move around manually. I usually box a rogue as the 3rd char and just stay on him for backstabs until I need to heal, then I tab to cleric and hit CH, then tab back to the rogue and stab some more. If I know the mob enrages I will tab to the warrior at 10% and turn off attack and wait.<br />
<br />
It takes practice more than anything. I started with 2 chars and once I had that down and people thought there were really 1 person for each character and not 1 person controlling both I tossed in a 3rd. <br />
<br />
I've boxed up to 4 on my 1 computer but it starts to put a strain on my system in high poly zones (mainly outdoor zones of Luclin, GoD, and OoW).</div></div><hr />

Hated EQW becouse of the very slow response time you have when the shit hits the fan. (I box Warrior/Cleric/Ench, and yes can CC, charm, CH chain with them or I would not bother)<br />
<br />
I figure I can semi-effectivley box a 4th for some DPS (was thinking Necro and single button hotkey all the dots) but beyond that the amount I can do per char is going to decline too much. Would rather just group with friends anyway. Gets boring just grouping with yourself.<br />
<br />
Yea, expansions break the bank and the monthly costs hurt too.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">richardkent</div><div class="date">01-07-2005, 12:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">6 computers, 1 toon per.  6 keyboards/mice/monitors.  Monitors facing me in a semi-circle, making it easy to focus on 3 monitors, while you can catch glimpses of a mob hammering you in the other 3 screens.<br />
<br />
Seeing as I only use mouse for trading / drag drop items in inventory, I bought keyboards with a small trackball in them (it is useless for serious mouse useage, jams up with finger grease/etc).<br />
<br />
All my hotkeys are centered around my main PC, warrior.  The key is, if he drops then you're looking at a CR, so I don't let him drop =)  Assist keys are the win, also using the cycle nearest PC, switch last two targets are truely wonderful.<br />
<br />
Also, I found that choosing your characters can make things easier or harder.  I chose one melee (war) and the rest casters (got the holy trinity covered) clr/enc/dru/mag/nec.  I specifically chose one melee so that I don't have to spend time moving them around as the mob gets bumped.  Having the 2 pets with max pet AAs makes for some decent DPS, though not as good as real melees, but I don't need to baby sit them.<br />
<br />
As for boring, playing more than one account has never, ever, been boring.  The game was so slow paced way back that I would watch a movie while 'playing'.  Over time, adding more and more characters to keep the pace up.  We used to watch movies while playing 3 each, which is when we knew it was time to up the toon count.  Before my buddy quit, we did 5 each (sometimes 6 for me) but we'd split them between two groups!  Now that is fun, being MT in one group but the cleric/druid for the other group really keeps you on your toes.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frozenorb</div><div class="date">01-07-2005, 02:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">3 computers and 3 accounts.  If I do more I load up EQW.  Max I've done is 5 box.<br />
<br />
I try to stay away from boxing more then 1 melee as positioning can get out of hand.  If I do, I try to setup where I tank in a corner to make life a little easier on me.   But in general, boxing is pretty easy.  If you think about it, casting some spells take forever.  Take Cheal.  Start the CHeal, and during those 10 seconds, you have time to operate other characters.  <br />
<br />
You also learn quite a few of the hotkeys and keyboard shortcuts.  I mostly play the SK with the keyboard (mostly) and mouse, while the cleric and wizard is practically fully operational by mouse.  I rarely use the keyboard on those and have a lot of hotkeys setup.  A lot of my targetting is done with the SK and the cleric and wizard will assist as needed, but sometimes I find myself targetting other ways; but the point is hotkeys are setup for it.   All the mice are easily accessibly by my right hand.   It took about a die to be able to figure out which mouse was to which monitor/character.<br />
<br />
Moving is simple as well.  I have a hotkey that basically does<br />
<br />
/target SK<br />
/stand<br />
/follow <br />
<br />
and it puts my cleric and wizard on autofollow on the SK.<br />
<br />
As for boring, it's like others have said.  EQ is slow paced with 1 character.  Having more keeps up the pace, not to mention opens doors to do a lot of things you can't normally do.<br />
<br />
If anyone plans to startup, start by 2 boxing.  I recommend an active character like a melee and a passive character like a wizard/cleric first.  From there add more characters as you feel comfortable.  Over a matter of weeks you'll play multiple characters without too much trouble.</div></div><hr />

Computer games and being good at them is like any other skill, always someone better than you, always someone you're better than. <br />
<br />
The only thing I'll say - bad 2/3/4/5/6 boxers are worse than the worst kind of thing in the world.  Oh, and I don't care what anyone says, anyone 3+ boxing in a group with others, they will notice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kiya</div><div class="date">01-07-2005, 07:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I don't want to hijack a thread, but since the subject is 3 boxing, I figured I'd ask here.  <br />
<br />
I'm currently 2 boxing (on a single machine, I use WinEQ) a warrior and a cleric.  I don't mind running more than one toon. However, I've been getting to the point of thinking, &quot;Gee, it'd be nice to have a haster around.  Gee, wish I didn't have to rely on procs for slows.  Gee, I hate spending time looking for a mana regen buff.&quot;  <br />
<br />
To that end, I've been leveling a chanter twink that'd been sitting on the shelf.  Once I get it to about level 62, I'm thinking of splitting it off to a 3rd account.   <br />
<br />
My main question is, would I get decent performance running 3 chars on one machine?  The current specs are 2.0gig p4, 1gig ram, ATI 9200 with 128meg ram.  Any suggestions on upgrades that would make it run better?  Buying another computer is out of the question for now, but I don't mind upgrading this one.</div></div><hr />

My second box is a 2gig p4, 1256mb ram, with a geforce 3 128mb vid card. It runs 3 pretty smoothly. Loading up is a tad slow, but you'll have that with any computer. I think you should be able to handle it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arnie</div><div class="date">01-08-2005, 11:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its just a matter of multitasking.<br />
<br />
8 Computers, 2 monitors/keyboards/mice.  Each group of 4 computers is plugged into an Omniview KVM switch hooking them to a single monitor/keyboard/mouse (you can get 8 and larger capacity KVM switches if you want).  I have one keyboard on the desk, and one on my lap.  Pressing scroll lock key twice then 1-4 switches to the appropriate computer.  Thats the hardware side of things for me.<br />
<br />
The actual mechanics of play for me are as follows:<br />
1. Keep characters on the same computers - ie, MT is always lower KB/comp 4, cleric is upper KB/Comp 3, etc<br />
2. Keep chararcters same position within group - MT is alway at F2 position, ST at F3, and Enc at F4<br />
3. Single pulls whenever possible - Having to keep mobs CC'ed really lowers DPS and makes things much more risky<br />
4. Extensive use of social macros: /Assist MT, /Pause 5, /Cast 1, /pause 5, /cast 1<br />
5. Keep buffs in specific order - this way you can tell at a glance what needs refreshed on which character.  <br />
6. Keep aggro on 1 char.<br />
7. Position mob so you don't have to move other chars.  Ideally corner every mob, if no corners available, then a wall works: MT in front, rog behind, and all pets and others pushing mob straight into the wall.<br />
<br />
By following 1 and 2, it is very fast to switch to a healer, target character, hit heal macro and back to another char (under 1 second for whole process)<br />
<br />
Once an exp spot is &quot;broken&quot; and I can get single pulls, the pulls work like this:<br />
1. Pull with war, Incite/taunt and head back to group<br />
2. Pal attacks mob<br />
3. Mage sends in pet and casts MALA on macro<br />
4. Shm sends in pet and slows<br />
5. Cleric starts CH (may do this sooner if taking lots of damage)<br />
6. If slow doesnt stick, start another CH with cleric and further debuff and reslow<br />
7. Attack with other pets/chars<br />
8. Chain nuke on all casters until mob is dead<br />
<br />
My normal build out for RCoD named for example is: War/Pal/Cle/Mag/Shm/Wiz in my &quot;exp&quot; group, then I usually have Enc nearby for buffs and occasional CC, along with some extra DPS from any 2 of Rog/Nec/Dru/Mnk or maybe a bard for manasong<br />
<br />
The main thing is to grow into it.  I played 2 characters almost from the start back in spring 99, and just kept adding to the mix.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ya I have tons of social macros, ya the pauses for fizzil and for internet lag are very familar heh.<br />
<br />
Ya I am also a real stickler about buffs position. <br />
<br />
Double pull is ususaly death as is losing agro.<br />
<br />
<br />
My toons require a lot less work then his also, <br />
<br />
I pull with warrior, then do my &quot;incoming key&quot; which is tided to socials one each computer that makes the toons do:<br />
<br />
Chanter tash/slow (maybe animiation attack) <br />
Warrior incite/attack/taunt<br />
Cleric fast heal <br />
3 Wiz delay then snare then one nuke<br />
<br />
then I move to my &quot;mob in camp key&quot;<br />
Chanter blind or nuke<br />
Warrior taunt/bellow/kick/disarm<br />
Cleric CH warrior<br />
3 Wiz nuke<br />
<br />
So just press one key on incoming and then spam one key when mob is in camp heh<br />
<br />
I lazer then others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">khur sed</div><div class="date">01-11-2005, 03:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I play from 3 to 6 toons depending.<br />
<br />
3 comps, lots of RAM, 1 gig prefered.<br />
<br />
For smoother play, I use two EQ folder, one for single play, and one for multiple play. On the multiple play, all unnecessery options are turned off, and all unused models turned off, etc..etc....<br />
<br />
2 toons per comp is good, my main toon is my war, always bring cleric + enchanter.<br />
<br />
The other 3 are wizard, mage, and SK.<br />
<br />
I used to 5 toon a lot, but since I've moved to Riftseekers, I prefer the SK for pulling, and with the mage to CoH him on bad pulls, it works extremely well, I went from wiping several times each sessions, to only doing CR on SK once or twice.<br />
<br />
The worst part of multi boxing in my opinion is the long crappy CR, because you can only blame yourself, and you really gonna hate having to CR 6 toons.<br />
<br />
The benefit however can be huge, you get to decide who gets what when it comes to loot, and no one ever argues about your choice of camp.<br />
<br />
The hardest part, is playing 2 melee, I wouldn't even dream of playing more anymore, I tried, and it was a total faillure, especially with pet push. Although on easy stuff I'll use a berserker for fun.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not true.  I was in a guild group at PoFire tables where I was 4box'ing war/shm/cle/enc each with own computer.  Had 2 guildies with me and one left so we replaced  them, the replacement didn't mention it for 2 hours until we finally started chatting and they mentioned the others were being quite hehe.  Then I explained that I was 4boxing. <br />
<br />
PS The shm is the only char that is fully my box, the cle / enc belong to RL friends. Although I suppose I could box 20 or so  if I really wanted to see my comp crash.  I get a lot of account info from guildies for flags, but I never log them on unless the expressly give me permission (in other words &quot; i need XXX flag&quot;). Still, I think it would be amusing to see someone 20box'ing 5 chars on each of 4 comps lmao. Keeping track of the tab orders on all 4 comps would be essential!</div></div><hr />

What do you mean &quot;social macros&quot;? is there a way to get another toon to cast a spell from another session? I would love to be able to click a hotkey on my war's session to start the cleric CH and shaman malos.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sam DeathWalker</div><div class="date">01-14-2005, 01:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ya people get confused between macro and socials. Its best to call the in game socials &quot;socials&quot; and 3rd party programs &quot;macros&quot;.<br />
<br />
I won't say how I do it but to take brutal example all I do is write in game socials and then bind them to the same key:<br />
<br />
Say the 1 Key<br />
<br />
<br />
This would be the cleric social, on say computer number one:<br />
<br />
/pause 3, /target Samlancer<br />
/pause 5, /cast 1 (CH)<br />
/pause 5, /cast 1<br />
/cast 1<br />
<br />
<br />
Then say on computer number 2:<br />
<br />
/pause 6, /target samlancer<br />
/pause 6, /assist<br />
/pause 60, /cast 1   (tash)<br />
/pause 60, /cast 2   (slow)<br />
/cast 3   (nuke)<br />
<br />
<br />
So I press one key to CH the warrior and to tash/slow/nuke with the chanter. And to start nukeing with the wizards. <br />
<br />
I have the timeings down to where there is enough delay so the chanter and wizards (they cast snare, then wait a bit to nuke) dont take agro.<br />
<br />
But I will run into problems. Lets say I start the social and suddenly pvpers hit the zone and attack me. I have to wait until the socials are done to do anything. So its better not to have socials that last to long. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Macros&quot; are like MacroQuest2 which has a ton more control (like you can check which toon is under say 30percent health and then cast CH) but is outright cheating. Socials are not. I spam CH, but I cant control when to cast it, if its up it goes off. If my warrior is 98 health I still have to cast it... I lose flexibility but then I'll never get banned. <br />
<br />
I dont know what you mean by &quot;sessions&quot;. Running two toons on one computer in a pvp enviroment where you even have 1-2 seconds switching dealy is a way to die really fast.</div></div><hr />

Both sit on desk with monitors in front of me. I have one keyboard in front of main comp and other keyboard in my lap. Warrior pretty well takes care of himself long as I position right. Then just auto attack on rog/monk make sure cle is chain cheal and my shm slowed. Dot up with rikam and mob will be dead soon.<br />
<br />
Some poeple don't see how I can do it but to me it's simple. I have been doing this for a long time. Also my probem is if I play 1-2 chars I get pretty dam bored. I only play 6 for grping on raids I will play 4 max.</div></div><hr />

Actually, with the CAT enabled (which will let you Alt-Tab in XP), swapping sessions (the window a character is active in) is pretty darn fast.  At least it is in WinEQ.  I gave up on EQWindows because swapping DID slow me down and if one character was zoning my mouse would be stuck.  I've also found that running each character off of a different hard drive or partition helps speed a *little* bit, as well.<br />
<br />
As for PVP, it's fine and dandy, just that I suck at it and don't enjoy it.   :o</div></div><hr />

The biggest challenge is moving everyone.<br />

Like when I farm tower named in BoT. Takes a while getting used to.<br />

Its nice, you can use 5 flagged people to get anyone in the planes thats of the appropriate level, opens up many nice spot.<br />
<br />

Anyways, just get macroquest and walk away.  I'm slightly amused at all of these overly complex set ups.  You COULD just get MQ and play but one character, and have all of the other characters automated.</div></div><hr />

Personally I wish MQ didn't exist, I think it's bad for the game, but as far as I can tell, SoE doesn't really care.</div></div><hr />

You can do more fiddling with WinEQ than EQW, plus, your mouse is not stuck in a zoning window when on another window.</div></div><hr />

I have 2 pc's and a laptop(dont think it runs eq anymore). I have my main KB infront of me with my sec KB between it and my main monitor. Back when farming Tawro was cool I would put my laptop inbetween the monitors and run a Wiz on it.  <br />
<br />
Casters are easy to 3+ box for all you are doing is hitting your assist then nuking. <br />
<br />
Mad props for people who can run 2 melee without using MQ.  I tried boxing my war and my bro's monk and found that with all the push the monk has it is hard to keep them both on the mob the whole time.  <br />
<br />
Why do people box?<br />
<br />
Sometimes it sucks to sit around for an hour lfg and not finding one.  I will often go to Sol Ro can kill mobs there while I am lfg to kill time.  You can only do so much trade skill stuff while waiting for a group.  If is also useful for farming stuff like VT keys.  I know how much fun it is for peolpe to sit at a camp with you for 13+ hours to try and help you get a piece of loot and not get any or very little exp for it.  <br />
<br />
Its also nice for when you start playing around 5 am mst and no one is on and you can start a group and add people as they log on to make a full group where you dont have to box. <br />
<br />
Buff bots rock too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then an old guildmate gave me his details to his wizard when he quit, so I started to 4 box. I did get adventurous and tried to 5 box tipt with a friends enchanter, and wiped at the area with crag beast matriach - I *never* used macroquest.. It gets very hectic (changing between eqw etc), and found that the machines would start to degrade in performance if I zoned etc (only 512 RAM). I wouldn't bother with eqw now, unless they've changed how much memory its going to take up, or you've got well over 512.</div></div><hr />

Everquests version sucks ass.  One of my buddies  used windows version to box, could really only do two.  I smacked him, and then downloaded EQW for it.  Easily runs 4 now.</div></div><hr />
