<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sevius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey everyone. For every chaarcter I create I usually create a story to go along with it. Just to give the character some life, and meaning.<br />
<br />
I was just curious of what your story was. So heres mine.<br />
<br />
Sevius was a powerfull Warrior of Rallos Zek many years before. He had hatrid in his heart and war in his blood. But one day, he realized life had to change... For he had a son, Sevius the II. His wife died on a ruthless attack on his home in Freeport, his wife was slaughterd...<br />
<br />
And once again, with his son he wanderd the lands with hatrid. But once again love struck him. He met a Elvish girl in Kelethin. They were married, and his life changed! He was in love, and changed his ways forever!<br />
<br />
But as for his son, things don't change so easily... His son hated his step mother, and chose to practice with weapons.<br />
<br />
4 years later Sevius and his wife had a new born son named Artavius. The young Half-Elf was good hearted, and he loved and followed Erollisi Marr.<br />
<br />
Both brothers Sevius and Artavius are rivals. A dark champion and a holy warrior. No matter how much abuse Artavius gets from his brother, he still loves him. As for Sevius, he still practices his weapons. For one day he wishes to slay his younger brother.<br />
<br />
**Still working on it. :)**</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Crathsor Gnawbones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Darkness crept over the land like a seething plague. I sat there and watched the last remains of the sun choked out as the night sky fell over me. Looking back at my past life as a member of a noble family was a good life. Yet the ties with them had to be severed to protect them from the evil that follows me. I decided to lie down onto the grassy knoll that was found to dwell on a life I once knew, and perhaps the chance to return to it. Nearly drifting off into a restful slumber I felt something tapping my foot. Upon looking up there was several orcs standing around me, and they took the pleasure of relieving me of my weapons that were at my sides.<br />
<br />
A much larger orc pushed his way through to reveal himself. Judging from his size and battle scars he appeared to be a legionnaire. The orcs stood there eyeing me over, and speaking their language amongst themselves. Making no sudden moves I continued to lie there watching them. Finally the legionnaire raised his hands up to silence the others and refocused his attention on me.<br />
<br />
You are the one known as Crathsor The legionnaire asked.<br />
<br />
Carefully I chose my words due to my current situation of being weaponless.<br />
<br />
If I am this Crathsor that you seek. What do you have need of him for Crathsor asked<br />
<br />
The orcs began getting impatient and began shouting with rage in their voice upon my answer.<br />
<br />
What we want of him does not matter to you. Now are you Crathsor The legionnaire said as he jabbed the blunt end of his spear into my chest.<br />
<br />
Seizing the spear into my hand I angled it back towards the legionnaire and drove it towards his throat. The spear ran through the legionnaires neck and came out the backside of his head. The orc fell to the ground with its body twitching uncontrollably. The other orcs stood there in horror seeing their leader fall to the ground. Taking advantage of this I stood up from the ground. The closest orc to me turned to face me while drawing its sword back into striking.<br />
<br />
Charging the orc I was able to knock it off balance causing it to drop its sword. Making usage of the crude weapon it dropped proved fruitful. Snatching up the sword two more orcs fell before the one I knocked to the ground ran a dagger into my side. Reaching over I grabbed the orc by the throat and looked at the remaining orcs. Fear filled their eyes as they dropped their weapons and ran off. Looking back at the orc that I still held firmly in hand I brought close to me so it can see my face.<br />
<br />
I am Crathsor Gnawbones. I said just before snapping the orcs neck in my hands.<br />
<br />
Let all know that fear has a new name, and I am that name. I shouted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Adzar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Ehh if you wanted him to let everyone know maybe you shouldn't a broke his neck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Crystara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Lindan, to answer your question Gimli's last name was Gloin. Or something like that. <br />
<br />
Gloin is Gimli's fathers name actually, hence Gimli son of Gloin.  They don't actually mention his last name in the movies as far as I know, possibly in the books but it has been so long since I have read them that I do not know for sure.</div></div><hr />
