    * Bloodrage - Health cost reduced.<br />
    * Heroic Strike - Damage increased.<br />
    * Parry - Moved to level 6.<br />

<br />
we're one of the few, if not the only, class this applies to. bonus to those of us who have hit 60.</div></div><hr />

There is still the issue with tactical mastery IMO that limits the builds to Fury/Arms, Arms/Fury or Arms/Prot. <br />
However, the none warrior related stuff looks nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iskandar</div><div class="date">03-07-2005, 06:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yes, this definitely further pushes an advantage for the average warrior to Arms. Prot warriors provide a nice edge on raids, and I'm not really sure what else can be done to benefit the efficiency of the people who raid with you without overpowering us.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hooray!<br />
<br />
<br />
Training - yeah whatever.<br />
Battle Shout - out of left field, but reduced cost is good.<br />
Bloodrage - good good.<br />
H-Strike - who can complain ?<br />
Parry - is that down or up ? I forget, at any rate level 6 is the first 10 minutes so who cares.<br />
Thunderclap - Good.<br />
Improved Sunder - nerf to single group, buff to raiders.  At 12 vs 15 I am not sure that anyone would really find it worth it, needs testing.<br />
Execute - Great change ( why is it that, in a duel with a druid, he will dodge once during the entire fight - right as you execute as he switches back to human form to use his instant heal ;p )<br />
Overpower - Good.<br />
Rage on parries - Ours or theirs ? Ours = good, theirs = meh.<br />
Charge - never noticed this, bound to make someone happy though.<br />
Sweeping Strikes - cosmetic bugfix, null impact.<br />
Sword Spec  proc - see above.<br />
<br />
As a quick request - can anyone post the full text here ? I can't see the blizz site due to firewall restrictions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greysen</div><div class="date">03-07-2005, 07:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looks like some overall good changes.  Looks like heroic strike is getting de-sucked somewhat, making it useful now hopfully.  I think the sunder fix is excellent in general, takes care of stacking issues completely.  60 vs 75 rage for 5 sunders is pretty solid in most situations too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">03-07-2005, 07:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think people would post the patch notes, if it wasn't for the fact that they freaking LONG.<br />
<br />
I think these are interesting changes.  I'm interested to see how they improved Thunderclap.  Execute fix is good, I know that pissed a bunch of people off.  Bloodrage fix can make a lot of difference for those that used it.<br />
<br />
I don't know, a lot of small interesting changes, with the big one (Rage on parry/dodge/block...I'm going to assume ours, btw) still in question as to how it would improve things.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some comments :<br />
<br />
Block: All creatures will now report a Block on attacks from the front, reducing damage caused instead of converting the attack into a &quot;Miss.&quot; Creatures will no longer be able to Block attacks from behind. <br />
<br />
Great !<br />
<br />
Blocking an ability that takes place on the next swing now blocks the normal amount of damage instead of all of it. <br />
<br />
Doh ! Some fights just got an awful lot harder ;p. Non prot spec can probably take this as a general bonus.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mummified Atal'ai will no longer cast Fevered Plague so often. <br />
<br />
Pfft, what was wrong with an instant cast 500DD nuke that took no mana and had no recycle time ? ;p<br />
<br />
<br />
The effect of the Spirit of Aquamentas and Choker of Enlightenment has changed to a +damage and +healing of all spell schools effect. <br />
<br />
Excellent, just what we needed with the complaints about atrocious caster itemisation, a nerf to the two caster items that were actually useful. <br />
<br />
Ramstein's Lightning Bolts effect reduced to 200 points of damage and a 10-yard radius. <br />
<br />
G'dammit !<br />
<br />
<br />
Fixed a bug that was causing Thrash Blade, Flurry Axe, and Ironfoe to have an additional attack when the effect went off. <br />
<br />
But didn't fix the bug where heroic strike eats them of course.  Sigh. Oh well, a general nerf to the most popular weapon in the game.<br />
<br />
Fixed a bug on Gearforge Girdle (awarded by the Felwood quest, A Final Blow) that caused it to have more stats than it should. It no longer has +12 defense. <br />
<br />
Prot spec gear nerfs make baby jesus cry.<br />
<br />
Deathstriker name changed to Felstriker.<br />
Rend's treasure table has been modified. <br />
<br />
Offering 2:1 odds on a new, nerfed to hell, deathstriker replacing the old one - any takers ? ;p<br />
<br />
A new engineering recipe is available in Blackrock Depths for a repair robot. This robot acts as a repair vendor for 10 minutes and will repair and purchase items for normal cost. This will allow dungeon groups and raids to get items repaired and sold without returning to town. <br />
<br />
Brilliant change. I wonder if it's reusable and if it has horrific item requirements ( woot 20 arcanite and non reusable for the win )<br />
<br />
<br />
Bottomless Bag requires significantly more mooncloth and two core leather to make now. <br />
<br />
.......... why I oughtta.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tarkas</div><div class="date">03-08-2005, 12:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So they're gutting block and sunder and giving us a bunch of battle stance window dressing, leaving no incentive whatsoever to spec prot. AWESOME!</div></div><hr />

I'm a bit upset that imp bloodrage is going to be worthless though, because I'm not giving up last stand.<br />
<br />
<br />
E: I don't think that fullblocks on next melee were anywhere near fair although I will miss them.<br />
<br />
Also imp sunder should go 1/1/2 or 1/2/2 to remain closer to the same vaule:<br />
<br />
1.3/15 == 0.08667 (before)<br />
<br />
1/13 ==    0.07692 (after)<br />
1/12 ==    0.08333 (closer to same value with out going over)<br />
1/11 ==    0.09091 (over yet still closer than 1/1/1)</div></div><hr />

<br />
The patch is going to make it so you generate rage when your attacks are blocked, dodged, parried, etc.<br />
<br />
I still much prefer prot spec, and I'm sticking with it, though. I don't really see how this patch makes it worse.</div></div><hr />

The only time I ever saw full damage block was 1) Mobs doing it to me 2) when I was fighting stuff where my block value was comparable to the damage they were doing. This is actaully a big help for us.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have dueled a few warriors that use hs constantly I usually have finished most of those duels with over half my health left. This is what I was talking about when I stated that fullblocks on next melee were unfair.<br />
<br />
<br />
On a sidenote, I take back my coments on the new sunder talent:<br />
<br />
Also imp sunder should go 1/1/2 or 1/2/2 to remain closer to the same vaule:<br />

1/12 == 0.08333 (closer to same value with out going over)<br />
1/11 == 0.09091 (over yet still closer than 1/1/1) <br />
I forgot to take into account the agro/rage ratio increase.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I am confused...<br />
<br />
If we block a special attack now, the entire attack is blocked instead of our usual damage reduction?  Maybe I dont pay enough attention to the combat log, but I never realized this.<br />
<br />
For example: if a heroic strike is blocked, all damage is reduced to zero?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">slitz</div><div class="date">03-08-2005, 11:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The patch is going to make it so you generate rage when your attacks are blocked, dodged, parried, etc.<br />
<br />
I still much prefer prot spec, and I'm sticking with it, though. I don't really see how this patch makes it worse.<br />
I think you're missing the point here. <br />
The argument was that you lose more rage as you improve your character with better stats (+defense giving you higher block/dodge/parry chance), since mobs will hit you less (that is what we want) which results in less rage generated (we don't want this). And thus the need to change the current block/dodge/parry rage relation.<br />
That is what I hope at least they are doing, anything else wouldn't make sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dracillion</div><div class="date">03-08-2005, 12:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Keep in mind that the implementation of this patch is still TBD.  Its not going in today.  I'd say mid to late April is probably about when it will go into place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SebastianDesoto</div><div class="date">03-08-2005, 12:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Plenty of time to get to 60 before paying full price for training!</div></div><hr />

<br />
And where did you get this from?  By all accounts, this was supposed to go in today.  After logging into the game and being no patch to apply, I'm open to the idea,  but I'm  very confused along with many other players for sure.<br />
<br />
EDIT:  Patch Notes - 3/07/05<br />
<br />
From Alla: Blizzard has added two test realms which are currently running the latest patch. There's no word yet when that patch will go to the live servers, though presumably not soon as it obviously needs to be tested out. Invitations will be going out to selected level 55 to 60 characters to ask if they want to copy their characters over to the test realms and play under the newest version.<br />
<br />
Guess you're right, not today.  Confusing none the less.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">slitz</div><div class="date">03-08-2005, 12:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This patch is scheduled for Europe on the 18th of March<br />
<br />
Just a pointer..</div></div><hr />

Only for next melee special attacks such as hs or conc blow. Instant attacks like ms or overpower were not affected by this bug</div></div><hr />

It just went onto the new test servers.<br />
Plus they probably figured they should at least let everyone know what they've been working on.</div></div><hr />
