<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bulbog</div><div class="date">09-23-2004, 11:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok so I think I know what this is about, it's to try to get people to do things in order maybe as to prevent people from skipping stuff and other classes looting epics pieces but this seems like a bug to me which I petitioned.<br />
<br />
What happened:<br />
<br />
So my guild is checking out the Bloodfields, kill that slumbering bazu then spawn the Girplan Devourer for the hell of it for the warrior epic piece.  We kill it, I'm told I get to loot the hilt so I try to and get &quot;You cannot loot this item Decripit Hilt&quot;  This same bug has happened to us when we killed a named girplan in the proving grounds and no one could loot the item.  I'm suspecting it has to do with you have to be on that step of the epic to loot the item but that's retarded, sony should just code the item to be looted by only the class that uses.  I petitioned it, I don't know just a pain in the ass since when has it mattered in what order you looted the items, and well it shouldn't.  Also this isn't a lore message it's giving, it's just a cannot loot one in red text.  Another thing I don't get is chanters were able to loot pages out of order and wizards the fluxing rod which the people that looted weren't even that far yet.  I don't have the 1.0 epic if that may be the cause.<br />
<br />
Oh well, just giving people a heads up and I hope there's a way I can get the item without having to kill the mob again.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tachyr</div><div class="date">09-24-2004, 02:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Happened to me in Wall of Slaughter , guild was raiding there and Dragorn Champion happened to be up so we killed him and i couldn't loot it either.<br />
However i was able to pickup the groundspawning eyes before the patch , not sure how it is now.<br />
<br />
But i agree its not a very intelligent way to force progression. It doesn't make sense if i stumble on a monster i know holds an item i need for my epic and i manage to kill it and not able to loot the piece. There must be a better way to do this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raargh</div><div class="date">09-24-2004, 04:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">my guild killed champion yesterday too, and none of us warriors could loot the powerstone<br />
<br />
there is not problem picking up items from ground (i picked pages and 2 other powerstones after the patch), but some kind of code prevent you from looting a mob if you arent at that step of quest. <br />
<br />
probably, everytime we complete a step in the quest, we get an invisible flag, just like the one we need for the Vxed step</div></div><hr />

<br />
Cily<br />

P.S. Champion did the same thing to me, but thats ok cause that was a FUN fight</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neksnappa</div><div class="date">09-24-2004, 09:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cipheron's loot rotted on us since we didnt have a chanter that could loot their epic piece, they had same message. And it seems nameds also got ninja changed in this patch; Lightningcaller Vhalek in MPG went from 1-groupable to flurry 3k, immune to slow, ae manadrain, and heavily resistant to at least 1hs and bow damage.<br />
<br />
I was still able to pick up pages in DS however, even though I've done nothing whatsoever for epic1.5</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bulbog</div><div class="date">09-24-2004, 11:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hrm weird cause I wasn't able to loot the decripit hilt but I was able to loot the eye piece off the dragorn champion.</div></div><hr />

passed this info on to friends so they wouldnt waste their time. i felt bad wasting the time of my friends that were with me to kill the champ, but was fun fight thats for sure lasted a good 8-10 mins necro was sayin he couldnt land a single dot on him , druid got magic dot was bout it.<br />

<br />
What the GM was trying to to tell you is:<br />
<br />
unless you have progressed to that particular point in the quest, and not skipped any steps, then you won't be able to loot the item.<br />
<br />
Are you saying that, based on the above, you *should* have been able to loot the item but *couldn't*?</div></div><hr />
