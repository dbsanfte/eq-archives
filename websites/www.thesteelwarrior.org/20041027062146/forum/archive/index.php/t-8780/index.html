<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Traask</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Not fortunate enough to be in closed beta, I was able to secure a spot in the stress test.<br />
<br />
Warriors in WoW really do get what they deserve.<br />
<br />
We can Dual Wield. (At lvl 20) Use 2H weapons (After 30 skill points - around lvl 8 I think) and we can use 1H+Shield.<br />
<br />
We also have 3 &quot;Stances&quot;  Battle Stance (Balanced) Defensive, and Beserker.<br />
<br />
Each of the 3 styles generate Rage (Tank Mana) for special moves, and Special Moves available are based on the Stance.<br />
<br />
Its a viable solo class provided you are willing to invest in materials to reduce sitting and healing, but when we are outnumbered by worthy adversaries, we die.<br />
<br />
Each style has a different strategy, and allows the adaptive warrior to hone his/her skills in excelling in close combat.<br />
<br />
Blizzard have finally got warriors exactly where they should be, up front in the thick of things, either dealing it out, or taking it - the good warriors adapt to the situation... the bad ones run, or get rezzed.<br />
<br />
To all my fellow front line fighters, this one gets a two thumbs up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Paen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I agree warriors in WoW are very nice, the special moves especially, theyre great enhancements with utility that add power to your class also, theyre not generic / useless shit thats not even worth clicking most of the time.<br />
<br />
Some of them EQ should have implemented years ago, like bash for example, what makes more sense, you slam into a mob as hard as you can and it interrupts his casting but he immediately starts casting again, or you bash him interrupting his casting and he cant cast for 4 seconds while he regains his balance etc..? Common sense stuff that should have been in place years ago.<br />
<br />
I'm sure a lot of people will fall in love with WoW, I still cant play it more than an hour or two without getting annoyed or aggravated at something and logging though. <br />
<br />
Like needing first hit to claim a mob to get the xp, very great idea btw even though FFXI did it first, to prevent KS'ing but warriors start with no range attacks at all so you will be running mob to mob to mob just trying to hit one before a caster, ranger or rogue tag it from a mile away before you can run up to it and attack it, you'll get lucky sometimes and actually hit it first though! If it pops right next to you that is.<br />
<br />
Or needing some groundspawns or drops off mobs that are needed by 400 other people also, racing to each one as soon as it pops, competing over insignificant things like that just pisses me off. They really should have used instancing and triggers a lot more imo. Especially in high traffic areas, but since they have seamless zones it would be impossible. <br />
<br />
Earth and Beyond and City of Heros both used instanced zones when they were over crowded which was really nice. Like if 50 people are in west freeport then anyone else to zone in would have the option to go to a new instance of the zone, west freeport2 etc.. They could still go to the crowded zone if they wanted to, like if they were meeting someone there or whatever.<br />
<br />
A lot of the 'bad things' about WoW are from the sheer number of people in the same level range and vicinity as each other though, so a month after release maybe they wont exist or bare no real significance, who knows. Zone instancing is still never a bad thing imo.<br />
<br />
The game also seems way to easy which may change as you get to a high level, I didnt since I couldnt stand to stay on for long amounts of time, so no idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mavelloc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">so far the war in WoW has alot of power then ones in EQ, started a warrior and hit lvl 4 with a few quests and once i got rush/charge was great since we can rush at a mob and stun em plus get a little rage from it to say hit em with another special attack and also i like that you can accually hit the mob at lvl 1 and not miss 18 out of the 20 hits you swing at em, so far at lvl 7 and gaining fast in lvls, too bad work has to get in the way for i can try the war some more, wasted my time trying a hunter when i should of went with war first  :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Like needing first hit to claim a mob to get the xp, very great idea btw even though FFXI did it first, to prevent KS'ing but warriors start with no range attacks at all so you will be running mob to mob to mob just trying to hit one before a caster, ranger or rogue tag it from a mile away before you can run up to it and attack it, you'll get lucky sometimes and actually hit it first though!

<br />
You get a charge ability at some point (level 6 or something?  Haven't been able to play all weekend since I got to 9 on thursday nite), it basically enables you to  sprint to a mob and smack it.  <br />
<br />
The other issue can be addressed simply by going where people aren't.  Granted I started playing immediately on Thursday when the servers opened, and I've got a half decent clue of what I'm doing, so I was ahead of the pack for the majority of the time, but you can still do some of this anyway.  If you see a big mob of people, don't stand next to them and expect to do things.  Or play with caster friends...problem solved.<br />
<br />
Bitching about overcrowding in noob zones on a new release is kinda retarded.  That's not the game's fault, and any remedy they put in place for that situation is going to be redundant in a month anyway when no one is there.  We're kinda hoping to avoid some of the dumbassery SoE brought to the table here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Paen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well I wasnt just standing around tons of people hoping for mobs  :p <br />
<br />
Started as a NE Warrior, everywhere around the starting city was overcamped, so I started doing quests hoping they would send me other places which they did, that other town Dalaanu or something, Shadowglen or something and that lake that starts with an A, but they were all crowded also because of people getting the same exact quests ofcourse.<br />
<br />
I'm sure it will thin out and not be as much of a problem a month after release, like I said in my first post. <br />
<br />
Instanced zones that activate only when a certain number of people are in a zone are still great and should have been implemented though, theyre not redundant a month after release they just wouldnt be used as much, it doesnt hurt the game in any way whether theyre being used or not other than the server overhead when they are active, which is a non-issue. Or triggers akin to most of FFXI's quest where anyone at that point of the quest can trigger their 'spawn' whenever they want.<br />
<br />
I did get charge before I quit playing and it did help quite a bit with the tagging issue. The special attacks in WoW are really just spectacular with all the diversity they add to your class.<br />
<br />
I'm not trying to take anything away from WoW, it's a nice game and I may even play it again a month after release. It's just an objective opinion from someone who doesnt think Blizzard are the gods of rpg's, quality or customer service that can do no wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Hinanek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Wars in WoW rule all.  That is all</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not really that they do no wrong, because they do.  The issue is that there are some companies who think that EVERYTHING is excusable, and that people will keep buying their shit no matter what.<br />
<br />
Fact of the matter is that there are things that have gone on in some games way too long, that certain companies just don't give a shit about.  It's a refreshing feeling to actually be surprised by a game where the people who make it and run it DO give a shit.<br />
<br />
Fuckin hell..server downtime is 10 minutes in the stress test to fix issues.  10 fucking minutes, when was the last time you saw a 10 minute patch from SoE?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Maleick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hey Paen<br />

<br />
<br />
Two words bro, <br />
<br />
STRESS TEST<br />
<br />
They overcroweded it on purpose so they could tune their servers, not so that you could play and enjoy the game.<br />
<br />
On game release they will have double or triple the servers that they had during Stress Test and overcrowding won't be a problem.<br />
<br />
However I do agree it was annoying but after I got to level 10 or so I could go to a much larger range of areas to fight so it wasn't a problem after the first day or two.<br />
<br />
WoW is teh win.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Maleick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hey Haass,<br />
<br />
I would like to add that the server downtime was intentional, and no random crashes. I think it did crash one time but that was becuase they shut down several servers and had everyone log into a few servers and where trying to crash it on purpose.<br />
<br />
Otherwise I had Zero lag, again Ill remind you this was a Stress Test and the only reason we played is so that they could tune there servers  :p</div></div><hr />

Warriors are so much fun that even the blaster/caster house defender enjoyed playing one.  And her rogue.  And, as she put it, finally playing a *real druid*.  And her pet cat, a Cornish Rex.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Wow warriors, and other classes such as hunter (teh win) and warlock, are completely awesome. The quest centric gameplay and each class has multiple roles it can fill, making forming groups very easy.<br />
<br />
As for the tagging issue, its already been stated by the devs and frankly quite obvious that crowding of that sort was intentional, as *gasp* this was a stress test. This was to test the load that the physical servers can handle. Except for a few wierd lag spikes, I can count them on one hand, lag was non-existant. I found a few bugs and reported them, but even then the game in its current state is more bug free than any other online game I've ever played, excepting perhaps DAoC with there uber-nazi-coders that they have.<br />
<br />
The game is great I was very sad to see the stress test end. I can't play EQ anymore. I can't find the appropriate analogy, but going back is not an option. There's just no contest.<br />
<br />
PS - I'd also like to add that I wasn't very excited about WoW when hearing about it. I read a little on it and liked the artwork, but wasn't too concerned with it. Stress test sign ups came and I decided to give it a go and got in. I've played AO, SWG, DAoC, and Horizons. Many of those because of free trials, but I think it gives me a bit of prespective. I still hold EQ above all of those. WoW however strikes me as the true next generation in MMOs. Even in its current state it stands head and shoulders above the rest and it isn't even finished.<br />
<br />
I'll leave my last statment. EQ2 had better be DAMN better than anything that they've previously released. It needs to be the powerfhouse that EQ classic was when it first entered the scene. I haven't had so much fun playing a game since I first started EQ. My family, who is usually ok with my extended EQ sessions and have gotten used to the time it requires, were concerned with how much I was playing WOW. The shocking thing is that I wasn't doing it because of some hideous timesink built into the game. I was playing because I was having fun. I'll probably log onto to EQ sometime this week to say my goodbyes and let my subscription pass. I'm sure my family will love the extra time I spend with them until WoW releases.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>faederya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Well said Vikken.  My family only got one stress test account and didn't get power back in the house until Friday night (hurricnane Frances took out our power for 6-7 days).<br />
<br />
Between my two kids and husband we had WoW playing 24/7 from Friday nights email till Sunday on Stress Stop.<br />
<br />
Screen shots can not do justice for the &quot;cartoon&quot; feel that gives this game such rich and vibrant &quot;3-dimensional&quot; look and feel.  I had thrown hardware after hardware after hardware at EQlive thinking the &quot;problems&quot; with lag were &quot;my fault&quot;.  I now understand that the problem is not me and my machines, FarCry/Doom3/and WoW run flawlessly even on our slowest 1.4ghz machine... the problem is EQ...<br />
<br />
Anyways, yes warrior is fun in WoW and quiet a viable solo class being the damage output, battle stances, and food regen items availble.<br />
<br />
As Haass mentioned in a previous post, all this time EQ has been making their hot dog look like a juicy piece of meat, adding chili and relish and even whipped cream and cherries, but WoW has put that hot dog back in the vendor cart.  WoW might not be top sirloin, hopefully that is EQ2, but WoW most certainly is a higher standard beef product than the EQ-Dog.<br />
<br />
Fae<br />
-waiting for a better piece of meat-</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Vampiah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I choose a Human Warrior for the stress test just so I could be that &quot;average&quot; warrior.  I just finished the stress test at lvl 37(very close to 38) and I must admit the warrior class was a very fun experience.  And I do have a few things to add about it...<br />
<br />
I led the most server firsts on Khaz for tanking named elite mobs so I have some knowledge on how tanking works.(well that and I was the only high level warrior who did not grind, I spent more time worrying about killing the next higher up elite named then killing mob after mob spending 90% of the stress test in group or duo)  But my argument is about defense.  What does it do?  I did not really know what it did... and still have no idea what it does.  I had anticipation 5 for a while while in defensive mode...and was getting hit about the same as if I was in battle stance mode.<br />
<br />
The only reason I favored the defensive mode was taunt and taunt alone.  Revenge...uh sucked, but I guess with talents it would be ok.  But the 16 or so damage coming from it....was just horrible.  Shield block was VERY nice for elite named.  Especially against Mr. Smite when he started hitting like a bazooka.(...well at lvl 20 it was alot &gt;&lt;)  Sunder armor...uh, I never really noticed this to work that well until I was fighting mobs 5 levels above me in strangle thorn.  IE:  I was able to hit mobs instead of just miss miss.  Shield wall was SO very nice...so very very nice.  AE Taunt(challenging shout) was very nice as well...maybe it was just me but the mobs gained a tad bit more aggro then regular taunt.<br />
<br />
When I hit lvl 37 I switched to an arms to head to mortal strike path(yeah, it was the last few hours of the sresstest and HAD to try this out).  Battle stance is just so very nice for solo'n.  MUCH better then defensive...well to me at this level, cannot speak on higher level.  Heoric strike was nice till I replaced it with Mortal Strike.  Charge and hamstring are VERY VERY nice.  Especially when you slap points into the talent's for em.  Overpower was just crazy with max in the talent area.  Rend..., well its there.  Thats all I have to say about it.  I think I gained extra rage from Rend...but I might have just been hallucinating.<br />
<br />
Oh, and the last thing i will say:  Max Cruelty to get max flurry in the Fury tree.  So nice...so very very nice.<br />
<br />
Edit:  One last thing!!  Demoralizing shout is VERY nice for solo'n and group.  Learn it and love it, it does not get better then this.  Battle Shout...seemed like a nice idea, but when tanking demoralizing shout was just much better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">WoW might not be top sirloin, hopefully that is EQ2, but WoW most certainly is a higher standard beef product than the EQ-Dog. <br />
<br />
I'm confused as to how you can start off by saying how poorly done EQ is compared to EQ, and then end up by hoping that EQ2 is a better product.  Deep down inside, you know it won't be.  Look at the problems you have with EQ -- all they tell you to do is upgrade your drivers, or upgrade your hardware, or this isn't supported, or that doesn't work, and I have yet to hear of anyone who can't run WoW.  <br />
<br />
You don't think this problem is going to persist into EQ2?  It may be different people, but they're working under the same idealogy.  Quickly produced crap is better than a polished game, and I think they're about to see that philosophy isn't going to work any longer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">For once, I totally agree with Haass. I've played EQ, I've played SWG, even played a little Planetside. There's just not a standard of quality that you come to expect from many other houses. Blizzard, whether you like WoW or not, is one of those dependable companies. You know that their products will meet a standard of quality that you've come to expect. And they've consistantly release products up to that standard. As much as I've loved playing EQ, I've come to expect poor quality SOE and they've consistantly backed up that expectation with every release that they produce.<br />
<br />
EQ was great for its time, but your kidding yourself if you think that they put out products as polished as other companies. Look at the record, just considering their track record. For instance, just from a backend/server standpoint:<br />
<br />
EQ - laggy, can't handle high numbers of players in the same location<br />
SWG - crapfest, by even the lowest standards, again can't handle the numbers<br />
Planetside - This game is unplayable with high numbers of people fighting it out. Hell they even have an artificial limit of how many players can come to the same area. Laggy, and this gamer was designed to support large scale battles<br />
<br />
All of these games have a lot in common. They take a long time to produce fixes even for the most common bugs. They take forever fixing gamplay/balance issues. Always patching in new features and never addressing current issues. Hell, SWG has been tauting a &quot;combat revamp&quot; for over a year now, ever since 2 months after release. has it happened yet? NO Is is needed? YES Is there any expectation that it will happen anytime soon? NO Are they releasing an expansion instead of addressing old issues? YEP<br />
<br />
Sound familiar? Souds like EQ.<br />
<br />
They have a proven track record of low quality publishes. Hell they didn't even listen to the beta testers for SWG when they said the game wasn't ready for release. They were right. The game wasn't and every day the game gets worse. They have no concept of how to produce a game. They've proven time and time again.<br />
<br />
I loved playing all these games for a time and I've loved my time spent playing with my friends in EQ. However, I've gotten a taste of the REAL hotdog and there's no going back now. Its like playing atari all your life and then being introduced to an XBOX. You'll play the atari out of nastalgia, but the difference is clear and for the better. You want Halo. There's no return.<br />
<br />
Same thing happened when I played WoW. I just logged on last night to EQ. the difference is astounding. I have a hard time believing I spent so much time playing that game. I could hardly stand to look at the game. Pixilated graphics, jagged edges everywhere, vsync tearing no matter what setting I used, stuttered framerates, and laggy response is heavy zones like PoK. Thats just the graphical differences.<br />
<br />
There's no going back, even if i wanted to. It really is astounding, the contrast. Graphics alone. The screenshots do not do WoW justice. And wait till you get a load of the sound and musical score. It took me all of 30 seconds to get playing after I logged into the game. And thats with no idea how the game works. (I haven't been following this title. I just saw the beta sign up and decided to give it a go.) I was having a blast playing within only a few seconds. The difference is astounding. Sometimes I want to kick my ass for playing EQ for so long, but I console myself in the fact that there wasn't anything better. Which, more or less, was true.<br />
<br />
But I don't have to convince you. You can choose for yourself. Granted I haven't seen EQ2 in action, but I find it highly unlikely that I buy EQ2 now considering the past record of SOE. Of course, that's an opinion, and you know what they say....<br />
<br />
Just wait and see :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Maleick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I Agree 150% With You  Vikken</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>draken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Yes vikken thats right on the money.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Lorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">You cant blame EQ for being a crappy game, it was the only one out there at the time that was &quot;ahead&quot; of its time.  Now that time is long gone, but there will be &quot;A New Hope&quot; soon.<br />
<br />
If you look at Blizzard's past games and titles, they speak for themselves.  I bought Warcraft 1 and thought it was one of the best games I have ever played.  Hell, I still play starcraft broodwars with my friends.  My cousin is totally hooked on Battle net with Diablo 2, and I just played a Frozen Throne BNet Map last night.<br />
<br />
Blizzard truely makes amazing games, that are usually number one and still sells very well, months after release.  They fine tune their products and makes sure its damn ready when they release it.  And they even update the game to make it more balanced on Battlenet even though its free to use.  <br />
<br />
The next generation is here and its WoW time.  EQ2 will be EQ 1, but more of a time sink, more issues, but prettier graphics.  The same people who brought you crap will bring you more crap in its second version.  Its all in the company and not the game iteself.<br />
<br />
Im just so glad that Blizzard has come out with an online MMoRPG.  If they made a Starcraft Online, I'd piss my pants.    :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Maleick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">lol, Yeah Starcraft online would be pwn.<br />

<br />
I got in EQ2 beta htis weekend.  I feel confident in saying that EQlives graphics engine just SUCKS ASS.  EQ2 is by far the smoothest graphics that I have seen, even better then FarCry.  Though it wouldn't run on two of my GeForce4 MX machines in did run quiet spectalarly on my two GeForce3 TI4200's.<br />
<br />
I'm still trying to decide though if I like the &quot;real&quot; feel of EQ better than the &quot;fake&quot; feel of World of Warcraft.  It's kind alike seeing the origianl Star Wars Tie Fighter explosions cmpared to the CGI in EPI/II.  It almost feels better not trying to go ultra realistic.  <br />
<br />
Anyways, going back in EQ2, still have not determined if I think WoW is more &quot;polished&quot; then EQ2... But since I didnt get in WoW beta ...<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I have little doubt as to whether EQ2 will be fun or not. I expect it to be pretty good. My main problem is whats going to happen after those devs move on to other projects, just like what happened in EQ. Add in SOE's ability to fuck everything up when they got their say...<br />
<br />
I do like the EQ2 graphics though. I have some friends that are die hard waiting for EQ2 to release. I'll probably wait till I get the word from them to make a final decision. One thing is certain though. All the new releases on the horizon makes for a happy MMO player.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Dintorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Ahh, the frustrations of beta.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>draken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">even with the current wow beta changes the WOW warrior jsut has so many more options then  the eq warrior in tearms of class progression hopefully when the next patch hits they balance them some more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Xyzix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">One thing I want to know is how friendly it is to those of us shackled to narrowband. Has anyone been on beta / stress test with dialup and had any significant problems? I'm hoping they are anticipating such users.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Kaldanm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">well it was possible before that nerf to chain Charge (stun 2 seconds), then use Harmstring (Snare)... fight a bit, run away, charge (stun again). consider you can insert dots and interupt casting between two charges : Yes Warrior was overpowered, I always won my duels during stress test, even against some level dumb paladin 28 with my Warrior 22.<br />
<br />
Warriors are still strong in current beta. it's nothing like the EQ one : <br />
You can snare. <br />
You can do some correct to excellent damage. <br />
You have emergency abilities to boost yourself, Inner Rage give you some bonus rage (meaning more special attack more quickly), Recklesness allow you to do insane damage for a short period.<br />
You have battle shouts to AE buff or AE debuff attack power.<br />
You have some inventive abilities like Intimidating shout, wich is allowing you to make all enemies run from you except the one you target who just cower in fear.<br />
<br />
And of course you have many paths of specialisation possible, meaning you will not have only 1 king of &quot;best warrior build&quot; like you have in EQ. for each warrior on beta forum who say &quot;This build is the best&quot; you have another one defending a different one with pertinent arguments.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">a proper (and much harder) way to fix charge would have been to make it's rage generation linked to the attack effectiveness. and putting a mod (the attack effectivness) to its domage and its stun length. and making the mod dependent of the awarness of your target (charging a mezzed mob -&gt; no awarness thus full mod, charging a low lvl from behind -&gt; full domage, charging a higher lvl from behind -&gt; close to full domage, charging a someone that is chasing you -&gt; scales with lvl differences, etc ...).<br />
and then making a chance to dodge/block/return the charge depending on this same mod (but inverse use). So that is you charge a very high lvl that is chasing you, you could actually 'impale yourself on his defence' and in result you receive the charge domage and stun (like if you charged a wall :D ).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">There's always a best build in a tree based game like Diablo 2 and WoW.  The only people who think there isn't are the ones without the best builds.<br />
<br />
Of course Warriors are way overpowered that at this point most people don't care if they're not getting the most efficiency possible out of the skill tree.  When you're better than everyone else you get more elbowing room to mess around.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you want dps you can go with  Fury or if you want to be more of the defence war you can go with  Protection its your call.<br />
<br />
Just  build your war how you want him if you chose  middle of the road  you got the extra defence and some offance based on what your goals are  you can check the war talents your self and see how you want to build your war.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is not eq you can build him to be dps machine or agor beast that can take hits and keep mobs  lock.<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
The warrior is the only true &quot;Tank&quot; in the game.  With big defense and taunt, we will be holding the aggro and taking damage.  I believe that in groups and raids, this will always be our expected role.<br />
<br />
If I load up on protection talents and another warrior goes fury, then wouldn't every group prefer me?  If they want dps, they can get a superior rogue or mage.<br />
<br />
We could end up having a game where a warrior shouts:  50th level warrior with improved taunt and defiance LFG.  I doubt a fury warrior would get groups as often.<br />
<br />
The only time I think that a dps warrior would be useful is soloing.<br />
<br />
I hope I am wrong, but it seems that protection is the only way to go for a raid and instance grouping warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>GraniteMG</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Not really the case. A Fury Warrior plays a great dps role in the game, its not like EQ where 2 warriors will just drag your dps down.<br />
<br />
Besides that, some areas just aren't dishing out that much damage and with a healer the extra dps is preferred over defensive stances, it's like doing an LDoN, you arent taking crap for damage anyway... and arms/fury are the only viable options for PVP at the moment, protection stance actually needs some work, but i'm sure it'll get hashed out through all the betas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">If a warrior is viable DPS the other classes will complain unless a warrior DPS has less defenses than the average DPS class, which is pretty unlikely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>bneta86</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Viable DPS doesnt mean as good as a dedicated DPS class...just that in a situation when mobs arent hitting hard enough to kill a fury tank - then he would be superior to a defensive one which could take more punishment...<br />
<br />
Its a ratio of output/mitigation - and in certain situations I am sure the pure DPS could tank and then you really dont even need a war.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Jorendar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">I personally am going to quit EQ and play WoW when it comes out. I am tired of EQ after playing for 2 years after release quitting for a year and then coming back a few months before Ldon release. I have played WoW on a friends account and i love it, it is so much more fun to play compared to EQ. Got my rogue up to lvl 30 and my hunter to lvl 25 and I have got to say it actually took time unlike EQ now where you can make lvl 25 or 30 in a week or 2. I also love how they do the quests rather than make you go out and just kill stuff for exp, adds a lot of background to the story while also giving you something to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Solanthus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">I thought I would throw a post in here, because I tire of seeing 5-6 people toss one ball around commenting on how awesome WoW is and endlessly agreeing to each others posts on the topic of WoW awesomeness. It's like watching CNN.<br />
<br />
I had a WOW beta account, and I did play it for some time. The game defenitely held my interest for a while and I will admit it is a blizzard title. Not a great blizzard title but you can tell it is their work. I got kind of bored of the game though. By level 20 I had died a grand total of 3 times, and this had taken me under a week. Wha? I'm sorry but the exp curve is way too easy to climb. I hated the cartoon graphics that I had enjoyed from WCIII, and lets face it there are some glaring class balance problems. Warriors are stacked. Of course you are enjoying them, right now they are the mustangs of the game. Its like saying you enjoyed playing an enchanter when you could exploit factions in Tactics. If I were you I wouldn't be surprised to see nerfs soonish.<br />
<br />
I gave my beta account to a friend, who actually ended up starting an EQ account a week later to play with me. If anyone is really interested in it, send me an email solanthus@gmail.com. Neither of us intend on playing. Account has a 21 war, something druid and some random mixes thrown in. Gear is pretty much top notch for the warrior from what I saw.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Bulbog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Heh, I'd be interested but the open beta starts in a week or two probably and I'm guessing they'll probably be on seperate servers so I couldn't play with friends.  Right now I'm looking at playing either a warrior or priest, playing with a group of 3 of my rl friends.  Group setup looks like shaman, rogue, druid and then me(warrior or priest)  Sort of depends how well druids can tank in groups I guess and well just how much I like each class heh.  I'll toss you an email though probably.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">When you're overpowered of course everything looks great, especially on the variety side.  The most powerful character can afford to do things differently by the virtue of being the most powerful.<br />
<br />
In no case should a Warrior ever do damage that's comparable to any class whose primary role is to deal damage.  I don't care if you have to do it while doing backflips on one hand.  Does a DPS Warrior have less survivability than a Mage or a Rogue?  I doubt that, so you should never come anywhere close to them in damage.  In other words, Warrior should never be viable DPS options compare to real DPS classes, because that's not our role.  You want to do damage, then you lose your ability to survive.  It's that simple.<br />
<br />
Even in EQ, I recommend recruiting Warriors for DPS due to their sheer survivability.  It is far easier to pick up a random Warrior with decent AAs, give him new weapons, and have his highest HPs out of all classes tough out the AEs (though honestly, Paladins would be even better) as opposed to picking up a Wizard or a Rogue and know that they need a ton of gear before they can even survive the duration of any reasonable AE intensive battle.  <br />
<br />
We can roughly measure a class's effectiveness at dealing damage as DPS X survivability (live longer, deal more damage).  Problem is that in all nontrivial (i.e. stuff you expect people to die) situaiton, Warrior's survivability actually allows them to be top damage classes.  And even in trivial cases, as we have learned from EQ people are wimps and like to take the safest way possible (ala the Holy Trinity) so a Warrior's place is still assured.  When you consider how high the Warrior's survivability is, a Warrior shouldn't even have 1/2 the DPS of a DPS class because otherwise a Warrior would end up doing more total damage.</div></div><hr />

I dont under stand this do you mean wow wars are over powered becuase there not a cookie cutter class like the eq war and they can make the choice  in how they want to make there toon ?<br />

Umm what exp zones  are you in PG ? Fire ? umm i think not maybe in a raid then yes  but not in a normal exp area .<br />

I hope you dont really belive that shit  with the gap between pallys ,sk's and the war being  so close id take a sk or a pally before a war there just not needed in like 99% of the exp grind game as a tank snap agro &gt; all ... group heals ,mana taps over power  some more hps from the MT.</div></div><hr />

umm. no, they are overpowered because they are huge tanks and at the same time can own shitloads of high level mobs solo. if you don't believe me, there are videos that can show you what I mean. its ridiculous. like I said, get ready for a large nerf.<br />

a warrior will do more dps and have better defense than a knight in almost every situation. do you play a warrior? our snap aggro and overall aggro right now is quite good, once I have aggro its rare a knight can take it back.<br />

the gap in tanking ability is not very large, the gap in DPS is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">I remember seeing the video with the Warrior killing xp mobs in 2 hits until he ran out of mobs and of course the reply was something like &quot;Warriors are not meatshields you shouldn't nerf someone for being creative, besides me and my 3000 warrior friends can do that with MS.&quot;  Never mind that no other class that is meant to do damage can kill a mob in two hits (maybe a rogue with Remorseless, but of course that's nerfed too).  Obviously the skill of auto attacking and hitting slam as soon as it pops up plus the ability to find a mob in an encampment is not so easy to master, certainly harder than hitting auto attack and hit MS whenever it pops up.  Anyway Bloodthirst has been fixed, and MS aka the double DPS skill will be next.  <br />
<br />
The fact that WoW even has a skill that instantly doubles your DPS is just bad design, as well as the double damage after kill skills (Bloodthirst, Remorseless) but thankfully Blizzard has at least some sense to nerf them to uselessness instead of having people talk about skillful one/two hit kills.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes there was and the guy made a post on the bliz boards about it saying that it was broken biz  disabled the skill right away and fixed it in the  next patch because its still in beta.<br />
<br />
  do you play a warrior<br />
<br />
Nope i play a bard in EQ  as my main just boted my buddies war for a few minis in fire 1 time and it was well rather easy didn’t take much  to get established agro after the npc  came into the camp and standing there hitting 1 skill to taunt and turning a mob  and cornering it was not that hard other then that shadow step procing bird he  was a little hard hehe . Still i think it had a very small learing curve  other then a few disps you could pop i didn’t enjoy him that much no real skills or any thing  to do other then hit attack and turn a mob .<br />
<br />
Maybe for eq they should give wars some more unique abilities something anything is better then  hitting 1 agro skill and well def.<br />
<br />
O and one more thing the war in wow who was using skills that were not supposed to stack and they fixed it like right away .. ive been sending in feedback  bug reports and  even a few petitions over the fact our  song: Ancient Lullaby of Shadow will mezz any toon  any lv 100% of the time and its supposed to have a lv limit of 59 for npcs and i guess a limit of 70 now for players  if you pvp you could see how this could turn the tables in any battle but soe could care less i guess.</div></div><hr />

During the stress test, the house druid rebuilt for this strange new universe, where the druid tanked (in her bear form) while my warrior was DPS.  For a lot of people, who play in small groups, this flexibility is going to be a boon, whereas a large group or raid with plenty of DPS is going to benefit the most from a warrior in *aggro tank* mode.<br />
<br />
I'm looking forward to seeing how things stand when the open beta starts - the system showed great promise from the peek I had at it during the stress test.  There will be ideal builds, of course, but I don't think that a cookie cutter build will emerge as *required*.  I've been wrong before, tho, and I'm prolly overdue for a second occurrence.</div></div><hr />
