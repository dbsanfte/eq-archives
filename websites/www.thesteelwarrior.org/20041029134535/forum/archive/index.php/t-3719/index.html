<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hittem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This post kinda sits on the fence between Battlefield and Bunker.  I put it here.<br />
<br />
I'm approaching the limit of what I can achieve for HP/AC with baz bought gear.  A few more items and i'll be maxed.  My magelo is at left.<br />
<br />
My guild will not go to VT as we are mid size family/friend oriented guild and the focus to get keys really isn't there due to the perceived low fun factor.<br />
<br />
My plan is to work up to LDoN BP and few other pieces and aug it all up as high as it can go, stuffing a few of the dropped HP augs in other slots where they can fit.  With my limited play time, in the next six months, i think i can get up to ~8700HP or so and ~1500AC fully buffed.  I'd like to develop a list of PoP targets and the HP/AC needed to tank them.<br />
<br />
From what i can see the list would be something like this:<br />
Tier 2: TT, Grummus, Behemoth<br />
Tier 3: AD, Saryn, Bert, VZ/TZ<br />
Tier 4: Sol Ro, RZ<br />
Tier 5: Fenin, the Rathe, Xeg, Coirnav<br />
<br />
What HP/AC is necessary to be successful at each of these Tiers?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

<br />
I can be fairly certain to say your AC/HP is enough up to Tier 3 at least. Not sure about 4 and +.<br />

However, you only consider it from a warrior's point of view! In order for your whole guild to advance, you need the necessary Healing and DPS departments. In other words, it requires<br />

- Mana pool, FT, focus item, weapons and Vengenance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Nothing before Teir 4 would be hard to tank with 8700ish raid buffed, with just max bazaar/quest gear i'd wager about 6400 Unbuffed, but realstically more like 6200-6300, which is about as good as good as a lot of the warriors in my guild when we broke elementals</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">you have plenty to get to tier 5 as MA<br />
but whatever or not your guild will be sucessfull in pop fights does not depend as largley on hp/ac but does on how well you work together</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Krassus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">nowadays with little or no work you can break that mark easy. Go Camp CT and quest ear and kill RoS hes up 24/7 now thats 3 , 100hp items easily obtainable with a little luck. Dozekar in ToV is always up for us and you can quest 3 very very nice 100hp items 2 of which have haste. Ldon hard mission loot ie: boots, bracers if CT isnt nice, haste cloak from EF has 85 hps, earring and mask in tak are 90hps, belt from guk is 90hps, mistmoore shoulders are 90hps your better off spending 2 days in Ldon and easily obtaining &gt;&gt; bazaar gear. For weaps id recommend while you camp your ornate BP from eindride to get that GBoS its nice agro and 85 hps. with Ldon + bazaar its pretty easy and cheap to get up there decent enough to tank up to EPs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dakryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Your a mid sized family guild that wont do VT becuase of the &quot;no fun factor&quot; in getting the keys....but looking at elementals?<br />
Somehow I find it mildly contradictory</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Uukla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Nod, as the main tank, your failure to kill the tier 1 bosses wont be your fault, it will be the lack of numbers =D  (healing / dps)</div></div><hr />
