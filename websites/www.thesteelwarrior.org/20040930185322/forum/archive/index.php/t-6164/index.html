<br />
when we zoned in..4 nameds..DD + Annihilator + Slaughterer + Depicator.........<br />
<br />
annihilator droped loot for us...but slaughterer did not drop anything...is this normal ? =p <br />
<br />
also if anyone can help , we did not notice any static repops...but roamers do...that true? :p</div></div><hr />

As Derrict said, they'll actually kill themselves if you keep them locked down long enough.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ejryu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Yeah, it looks as though the big guy (Annihilator?) siphons off hp from all of the adds that are up.  The trick as an enchanter is to realize which mobs will need to be mezzed next, and which mob will die before your current mez wears off.  The fight is a blast.  The adds can con anywhere from blue to yellow, so use bliss, ummm....unslowable as well.  I don't remember whether they despawn or not after you kill the named.  Leaning towards no.  One heckuva fight $$</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can anyone confirm that Decimator and Slaughterer actually drop loot at all?  Atm I have a very limited pool of guildies that are geared/skilled well enough for Ikkinz1, and thats just farming the nonDD named.  The 8 hour Lockout Time makes more than one run a day almost impossible, and its not always possible to get even one run a day done.  As such we're willing to spend the extra time when we DO get a group together killing the other two named, assuming they at least have a chance of dropping loot.  As I post this we're medding for another Slaughterer kill, so mabye I'll answer my own question.  /crosses fingers<br />
<br />
EDIT: Slaughterer down, second time no loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>karekanoi96</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">never seen loot off anything other then DD and PA well depends on your instance you can spawn some yellow rares for 35hp mana augments or a earring that is crappier then the one off PA.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Name of the earring?  If its caster usable might appease my casters some, since PA drops 2x melee loot and only 1 caster loot.</div></div><hr />

its melee only name escapes me 130hp also drops off kodtaz rares. All the trials have predominately melee loot.</div></div><hr />

Earring of Destructive Essence (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68696)... and it is melee-only.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Fynepisa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">How hard are the Slaughterer and Decimator compared to PA? My group was able to barely take down PA last night in quite a fight, but even just dealing with the trash was not simple for us as we are only bazaar/LDoN geared. I'm wondering if it is worth our time trying to clear to them or if it's a toss up if we'll even win the fight.<br />
<br />
Also, even if they don't always drop loot, can they drop spells? We still need a lot of the dropped spells and hanging out in Ikkinz for them seems more appealing to me than mindlessly farming KT.</div></div><hr />

Same difficulty, just not worth the time to clear the mobs near them and then kill them.  The best way to farm stones and spells is off the minis in Kod'Taz.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Derrict</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">or get an instance with rares.<br />
<br />
You can't farm the instances since you'll get a lockout timer when you kill the first PA, so you can't just leave the instance and go grab another one and repeat it again.  Then it's not worth another 1-2 hours to clear trash to get at the others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Daabu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Isnt there a 10hr wait between trial attempts, as well?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Fynepisa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">There is no lockout if you don't kill the Annihilator so if you have a rogue and tracker you could feasably cycle them until you got some named.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>karekanoi96</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">there is more then just one trial to get instances from and trial 3 is best for instance farming since first boss is deep. Regardless if you kill mobs in kodtaz or instance wont matter takes just as long to spawn one as it does ti get a instance or clear to one in an instance.</div></div><hr />

I'm wondering how many other nonTime guilds have killed DD?  Had more than one person from guilds above us tell us we had no chance on DD ;-P</div></div><hr />

You do realize the same mobs are up every time you create an instance.  This isn't like an LDoN instance where a random name can spawn.  Singular might, twin struggles, tri fates will have the same mobs up each time, same location - the only random will be what the first name drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Not entirely Derrict.  Occasionally there is a minor named in at least trial 1.  They are just random, and only drop items that nameds in Kod'Taz can drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>keldo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Random named can spawn in any of the single group instances.  I've seen the most in Twin Struggles.  The wandering snake in the priest room can respawn as a named, even.  Same loot table as Kod`Taz random named, as mentioned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Surlok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">The ones in ikkinz 1 are named Pixxt &quot;XXXX&quot; and are yellow rather than red and they spawn randomly .<br />
<br />
A couple times doing this we have had two up even.All I have ever seen off them is the 35 mana Aug though.<br />
<br />
Also there is a pretty decent Mask that drops that has a Poison based Dot Focus iirc,But it drops randomly off trash and is rather rare,I have only ever seen one in about 9 trips in the zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Derrict</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">My mistake then.  In the first few weeks GoD, I was in probably 15 instances and never saw the random loot dropped.  I don't recall any guildmates getting them either.

<br />
Does the lockout time affect you if you dont kill anything?  Can you just keep getting instances until you get one with a PA?   Or have trackers/rogues/invun types get their own instance and whichever has a PA wins?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Fynepisa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">There is now a 1 hour lockout for just creating the expedition so you can't just cycle them. I've only done one since the patch (trial 2) and the Rav Interceptor was up as soon as we zoned in. He was considerably easier than he was before the patch so it looks like they just gimped them down and made them rarer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Dragoscott</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">I had just finished beating all 3 trials like a couple weeks ago and hadn't been back since, then last night tried to spawn trial #3 and cleared to the archer... and wasn't up. I thought maybe it just wouldn't let me spawn 'regular' trials anymore since they'd been beaten/other progression quests done also, so i made my cleric leader and had him get us a trial #2 while lockout timer was running on 3, and named was up.<br />
<br />
Glad to read some clarification on this, as other people i know without beating all 3 have spawned nameds each time. Guess i just have bad luck hehe.<br />
<br />
Additionally, as stated above, ALL mobs in trials are now noticeably easier by a good deal. Named themselves were gimped down pretty hardcore, almost comparable to some of the field nameds in kod'taz.<br />
<br />
Oh, and trials also now have literally less than half the mobs in them as they did before. Which saves on clearing time i guess, but pretty weak.<br />
<br />
Wish they'd stop ruining challenges.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bosses are slowable now, but some changes, don't use defensive on the DD, but she slows, probably done to allow Pallys/SK's to tank her with greater ease, still rough if not using a fully time or higher war, otherwise it's probably a joke<br />
<br />
Not sure if this always happened, but 1 priest in Ikkinz 2 will summon you from outside the room if you; wipe, come back and the snake repops in between, summoned tank and then me from far outside with 0 agro on any mobs (yes we had zoned). <br />
<br />
To anyone who has done the old versions these will be pretty easy, for newer people they will still present a challenge,we had all but killed the DD in it's previous state and took us 3 tries to get just the DD dead this time.... now we gotta think of a way to kill them priests =/</div></div><hr />

Using any defensive disc causes her to attack (sorta like rampage) on a random member of your group, something to the effect of;<br />

<br />
Orionsun was the chanter not tank here, but was definatly triggered by a defensive disc from the monk or war. I wasn't in the trial myself so couldn't say which for 100%.<br />
<br />
It appears they've changed the trial to be more focused on the boss, not the trial clearing, but it certainly is not as hard as Ikkinz pre patch, but the easy Ahnilator loot is gone unless you get lucky :(</div></div><hr />

Kinda slipping off topic but I've noted the same thing.  On two occasions used furious then defensive and got the spam but he stayed on me.  I figured it was a hate reduction to disc person but might not cause problems in every case.  If its random on groupmember then I got lucky twice.</div></div><hr />
