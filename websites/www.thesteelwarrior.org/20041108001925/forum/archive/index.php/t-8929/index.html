<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>sHORTY</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just want to apologize to the few of you that have been affected by recent spurts of bad performance here at TSW. Those of you who have been affected know what I'm talking about - that nice pretty white SQL error page :).<br />
<br />
I believe I have isolated the problem and solved it, however, I wanted to let everyone know that I am aware of it and working hard on finding a solution just in case it happens again.<br />
<br />
Thanks again everyone for your presence here.. be sure to tell all your friends about us.. we're slowly starting to pick up our userbase and increase the amount of posts that people are putting into the forums here. Let's keep it up and continue to make TSW one of the best fansites around!<br />
