<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vato</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello, I am new to playing the Warrior class. I have a fairly strong grasp on playing a &quot;tank&quot; class, I have a 52 SK, but weapon selection is bothering me. I'm currently at level 9, but plan to get to 50 within 2 weeks.<br />
 I purchased a Swiftblade of Zek, now i'm wondering if that was a wrong choice. I plan to duel weild that plus a Lamy blade until I reach weapon Proc levels, which should be by the end of this weekend. <br />
Should I sell my SoZ for fast delay/proc weapons like: Wavecrasher and Barnacle Covered Axe? <br />
I have a Silvery Belt of Contention for 21% haste if that helps.<br />
Any advice on this matter will help. <br />
<br />
&lt;off topic&gt; why are Warriors getting screwed again in LDoN???<br />
everyone is getting spells, Warriors get another AF'ing...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">See the sticky thread about the droga 1-handers at the top of this forum.  Pick up those two and a Greatstaff of Thunder and you will be all set for weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>ThornyEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I ended up giving my SBoZ to my little twink ranger; she's a slice-o-matic with that thing. I think it's a great weapon for the lower levels (meaning below 50), especially if you're on a mission to get to 50 and beyond quickly. The delay, ratio, and 100 HP's it gives you are great for getting your skills up and not worrying so much about dying.<br />
<br />
However, as you may have noticed, I (meaning my warrior) no longer use it. The CHoS and SotB from Droga are excellent weapons post-50, until you can get some of the TB/EB weapons. Also, the Greatstaff of Thunder (GSoT) is by far the best aggro bang for your buck at 55+. GSoT's are 1-2Kpp on most servers...crazy low prices for such a great weapon. I paid 32Kpp for mine when they were first showing up and I don't regret it one minute; it's served me well.<br />
<br />
But back to your original question: no, you didn't make a mistake. The SBoZ is a great weapon for getting you up in levels. You'll eventually replace it, though, and that's just a fact of EQ life.</div></div><hr />
