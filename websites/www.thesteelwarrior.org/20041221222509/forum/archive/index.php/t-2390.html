<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Demorgoth</div><div class="date">08-06-2003, 10:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The main problems I see with warriors using shields are as follows:<br />
<br />
1: Major loss of DPS and associated agro as well as proc agro from offhander<br />
2: Increased riposte damage from faster delay, causing more damage to be taken than the benefit gained from the ac/hp on shields<br />
<br />
This leads to shields being completely ignored by warriors in 99% of situations.<br />
<br />
Potential solution: Put a focus on a lot of shields. Maybe even a 'bolt on' in LDoN. Maybe even a high cost/scaling AA:<br />
<br />
Focus: 1handed mastery<br />
<br />
This focus greatly enhances your ability with 1 handed weapons when used with a shield.<br />
<br />
RP excuse:<br />
By only using a single one handed sword, you can devote more attention to it's use, putting all your being into striking devestating blows.<br />
<br />
Aim:<br />
To bring up the DPS (and associated agro) on a 1h/shield combo without overpowering that same 1hander when used with another weapon offhand. Also to bridge the huge gap to using a 2hander with a shield (which would kill dual wielding completely)<br />
<br />
Mechanics:<br />
+50% to primary hand weapon delay<br />
+100% to primary hand weapon damage<br />
+50% to primary hand damage bonus<br />
maybe +some strikethrough/parry/accuracy mods<br />
(disclaimer: numbers for illustration purposes only, subjec to balancing)<br />

If you want to suggest a way to make shields more viable, then suggest a defensive oriented change.<br />
<br />
Probably the quickest and easiest to code and balance change would be making a shield block all ripostes. That gets around one of the primary problems of using a 1 hander and also doesn't change the tanking ability of those classes that wear a shield by default. Adding a dodge ability to shields would be a bigger boon to clerics, shamans, druids, et al, for example. Since they generally don't melee, negating ripostes wouldn't be more than a token improvement to them. It would be a non trivial upgrade in tanking ability for warriors when fighting boss mobs to never have to worry about riposte damage.<br />
<br />
I think that would be at the very least a good start.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khumak</div><div class="date">08-06-2003, 06:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I disagree.  I oppose any defensive upgrade to shields unless the DPS of dual wielding classes is also adjusted to make them competitive with non dual wielders using 1h + shield with vastly superior weapons.<br />
<br />
I don't expect to do as much damage with 1h + shield as I do with 2 1h weapons or with a 2 hander but I DO expect to out damage a knight using a shield.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">08-06-2003, 06:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Simple solution: double our damage bonus when we use a shield (in addition to letting us block with the shield).<br />
<br />
Run the numbers in the Weapon Efficiency Calculator (http://members.cox.net/nate1861/efficiency.html).  DPS would be acceptable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wrong answer! Thanks for playing.  All blocking ripostes would do is make it more viable for knights tanking with a shield. A true melee would lose 1/3 to 1/2 of their DPS (by shelving 2H or Dual wield for a shield) with no other means to augment aggro generation... and yes for Warriors DPS DOES play a significant role in aggro generation (thou shalt not live by procs alone). <br />
<br />
Without a boost in aggro generation(of some kind) from use, shields will just make a warrior into a manaless paladin, with less efficient weaponry. Why would we want to bother?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tsaotsao</div><div class="date">08-07-2003, 12:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The way shields are implemented in EQ, it makes no sense to use them if you can dual wield. <br />
<br />
In medieval combat, a shield was quite effective as a defensive weapon compared to armor. The shock of the blow was absorbed by the shield and the skill of the fighter to deflect the blow. THe strength and flexibility of the arm and shoulder helped to minimize the shock to the body. The shield was used as a weapon, to block or deflect strikes, and as a canopy to survive arrow volleys. The more fighters who had shields, the better the groups protection from ranged weapons.<br />
<br />
Sometimes they were painted with a coat of arms. A symbol of the fighter's family, or clan. This would clearly identify them to their enemies, in a way &quot;taunting&quot; them. As long as their enemy saw the symbol up, the enemy would want to target it... wouldn't they?<br />
<br />
To make shields realistic to a warrior, they would need to be at least 200AC, have a skill(s) associated with them for blocking, striking, and shielding.  And they would have an agro factor to them. At least to fit into gaming.<br />
<br />
As far as damage goes, it looks like SK/Pally's were given better ratio 1HS to compensate for having shields.  If warriors were given similar 1HS, they would simply dual wield them unless the shield was SUBSTANTIALLY better than it is now. <br />
<br />
So, for shields to be viable for warriors in EQ:<br />
<br />
minimum +200AC<br />
Enhanced taunt/agro factor<br />
Use as a weapon<br />
Blocking<br />
Effectiveness against ranged attacks<br />
Magic Shields have effectiveness against various magic attacks <br />
<br />
Will it happen? ROFL.. no, I doubt we would ever see it. Not where it dropped at a point in the game where it would matter.<br />

<br />
Then flag all these shitty 1-hander weapons that rot all the time that pal/sk get as such and add warrior, rangers and bards to some/all of these weapons.<br />
<br />
These drops will now not suck as much, shield will be a new choice of combo with balanced lower dps and higher defense.<br />

Problem solved and it didn't require 100 hours of rebalancing.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krauth Isuber</div><div class="date">08-08-2003, 12:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been thinking about this...I &lt;3 my shield, but the only time I use it, is after I know I have a major helluva agro lock.  Once you have a good agro lock, then equip the shield, you notice a LOT less riposte damage being taken (no swings from secondary = less ripose from mobs).<br />
<br />
I remember reading about the Clerics summoned hammers that some have a higher proc rate than other.  I think it would be very beneficial to add a +proc percentage if a WARRIOR shield is equipped.  Stormriders Carapace gives me a nice AC jump and good HP jump over my CHSD (GBoS in primary).  If the shield gave me a better chance to proc, I would probably be using my shield a lot more often.  Not to mention easier to get avatar up ^_^.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Synapticus</div><div class="date">08-08-2003, 12:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with Khumak, I think just increasing the Damage bonus in  primary is probably the best way to tweak this issue.  DPS would not be as good as duel wield, but sufficient enough to hold some form of aggro.  <br />
<br />
Also other methods of jacking up primary hand damage when equipped should also be considered.   The bottom line is that warriors end up sacrificing WAY too much DPS for the benefit of shield stats or effects.  A warrior should get some significant upgrade to his primary hand DPS when holding shield, and this upgrade should only benefit a warrior.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hell no.<br />
<br />
I don't want another warrior only bandaid fix to be beaten around the head with for the next 4 expansions (was re: /disc defensive).  Tie it to the items themselves, or make it part of the dual wield 'fix', but please don't make it a warrior only trick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomos</div><div class="date">08-08-2003, 10:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, what warriors need are hand-and-a-half swords, and bucklers.  The sword would have stats like pally 1h weapons, but the only shield type you could use with it would be a buckler, and you couldn't use a normal 1h weapon in the secondary slot while using the 1 1/2 sword.  This solves the DPS problem of wielding a single 1h weapon, it solves the problem of warriors using the new uber 1h weapon with an existing offhand weapon, and it lets you use a sword and a shield of sorts.</div></div><hr />
