<br />
Anyways, if some of you could give me some equipment ideas, i would appreciate it. Also weapons, my chanter is time flagged, so i can get into most zones to try and farm stuff if possible, but am not afraid to buy in bazzar.<br />
After doing so many raids and exp groups and seeing a good warr control mobs I had to try it, my goal is to make a good main tank, I know equip dont make a good tank, i have seen many with all the equip and flags that dont do a very good job, but it is a start.<br />
Anyways any imput would be helpful and I would appreciate it much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">09-14-2004, 07:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">want a really good tip?<br />
<br />
do it untwinked. seriously. no better way to learn a class than to do it from scratch.<br />
<br />
believe it or not; warriors are more than autoattack and afk. <br />
<br />
but enough of that shit. go do a search for gothic armour in the bazaar ( or make it yourself if you're a smith ), do a lookup for weapons in the bazaar that newbs can use with no level limits, and get a decent haste item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">09-14-2004, 09:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Shik is right as usual.<br />
a longer version could be : tanking job is just a matter of gears, if you have them you rock if you don't you've got much pain ; but playing a warrior to its full potential is a matter of personnal experience. And since our roles don't change from 20+ to 65 in single group content, it's better to learn it at 20+ than at 65, and thus having gears that suit your lvl to understand better what to do.<br />
<br />
But since you are already lvl 48 and that your stats suit your lvl, I think you know your job now. but you don't know how to get dressed for your job (you still think with the enchenters gear in mind). You have to keep in mind that post lvl 45, only AC and HP matter. with a ratio of 1AC for 5 or 6HP (don't forget that when STA is unmaxed you get HP from it). <br />
<br />
so your bracers, your fang earing, your helm, your necklage, your gloves, your crafted ring and your shoulder are bad choices. you have to change them asap. the standard for lvl 45-55+ is Fierce Heraldic (you can't use them, but look for similar stats), and the classical ornate/Royal Attendent after.<br />
<br />
To keep aggro, below lvl 50 you must use dps for it, after you get the boost of procs. You have to know that dps aggro is a bad naming since it is not linked to your dps (with the same setup you get the same amount of hate if you hit for max or for min or if you miss), thus the only thing to keep in mind is &quot;at given weapon, the more haste you have, the more aggro you generate&quot; and &quot;at fixed haste, better is your weapon ratio, better will be your aggro generation&quot;. About procs : pure hate is the easiest to understand thus it is preferable, pure stun should be around 350 hate (no matter it is resisted), debuff should be around 300 hate (no matter it is resisted), DD and laftap should have a 2:3 ratio, heal and runes may have a 1:2 ratio , DoT are worthless on short fight (less than one minute) and have bad aggro. Sometimes it seams that resisted procs draw only 80 to 90% of its based hate but it is unconfirmed.<br />
for example, the red epic have a better proc than the droga combo but it is not a better weapon because of the ration difference and because it seams to draw less aggro when resisted (which does often).<br />
<br />
So after lvl 50 the best RvR weapons are the CHoS / SotB combo, untill you get upgrade during your fighting live.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">09-14-2004, 09:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I agree with Shikarii: most (but by no means all) of the better warriors I've seen got good because they weren't heavily twinked.<br />
Better gear helps you do your job, but it also &quot;forgives&quot; you if you don't pay attention to all the skill things/tricks you might do to be good. So, if you can discipline yourself to do those things anyway, then you get the best of both worlds.<br />
As for equipment:<br />
Your shoulder, your gloves and your belt: you're going to need better haste in a couple of levels, and because your back slot is pretty good it's likely that you'll get haste in the belt slot, which means you'll be replacing your gloves. Runed bolster belt or soulscream belt would both be commonoly available upgrades; RBB would last you longer, but you can probably go get a soulscream yourself (Veksar). You can also run haste through tribute; most warriors can't afford it before lvl 65, but perhaps you can. There is a &quot;warrior usable haste&quot; thread in the library section of this site, so I'd take a look at it for more ideas. I'd say: 31% is a good upgrade if you can get it yourself/real cheap; 36% will last you a long time (if you have 36% haste at 65 it will be very hard for anyone to tell you don't have 41% for quite a while); 41% to be raiding guild tank at level 65+. I'd consider a copper hammer of striking if you have trouble with aggro. I'd look at a new earring for the weakest slot there. Also, you can get a better ring than the black pearl for a few hundred plat.<br />
Those are some ideas to start with.</div></div><hr />

Your Chanter is in a Time+ guild, get some friends to take you into Kael and do Vindi/AoW/Tormax , they drop alot of stuff that you can use.</div></div><hr />

I'd say your equipment looks fair for your level, so I wouldn't worry too much. Start looking around for a Copper Hammer of Striking to pair with your Sword of the Bloodsworn. You can use your enchanter to farm some ornate molds for your warrior and upgrade your armour at level 55.<br />
Like the other posts said: Playing a warrior is part skill, part equipment. Good equipment will take you quite far, but some day skill will be required too. Be careful about twinking too much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">snacks</div><div class="date">09-14-2004, 04:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you all for the great replies. I will start on the suggestions today.<br />
<br />
I guess i misrepresented myself a bit with the magelo link, most of the stuff he has i just threw on him, leftover things i had  and just picked up in recent groups or raids to get an idea of what was available. He pretty much was bareboned to this point. Also with the patch today i couldnt update all his skills to what they really are, but i try to keep them all maxed so some may be wrong.<br />
<br />
Anyways , i have been working hard to learn the class, and paying more attention to the tanks in my groups . I read somewhere else on this board that its the little things that make a good warr stand out, well I couldnt agree more. As a chanter, I see things in groups from a different perspective I guess, like when we have adds and the mt seperates after the mezz message, or how to properly wake a mezzed mob , positioning of the mob and so on, so I try to do these things for my group also.<br />
<br />
So far I havent had to much problem with agro, unless we have an over ambituos necro/droood who dots before i can engage. ( i thought being a warr I wouldnt have to deal with them anymore like i do with mezz's )<br />
<br />
Next question, where should I put my first 5 AA's, also, should i stop and get them when i can do AA's  , or keep leveling ?</div></div><hr />
