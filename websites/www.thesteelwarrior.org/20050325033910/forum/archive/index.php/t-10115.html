<br />
Been awhile, and alot of expansions since I was 52, but would suggest checking out the new hotzones (listed in last patch message), maybe some PoP (pon, pod, poi) or Oow (DS).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">12-28-2004, 06:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My advise would be to use groups for experience and your solo time mostly for farming. Depending on the economy on Zeb, the North K spiders might be good (loot the spider webs and kill the lions for low-quality and better hides). I'd go through the Misty thicket PoK book and Runny eye to get there. You can, if you want, stop in Runnyeye and work your way down in there for fine steel, a bit of plat, and stuff like the blackened alloy medalian (twink gear for baby casters; might be a market for it). There's a bank in runnyeye, and the goblin banker will let you bank even if you're KoS to goblins, so you can drop off fine steel and coin and get back to killing fast.<br />
You can also hit up any evil eyes you see in the gorge of King X because they drop ivory, a component in your cultural armor. If you ever find a GM smith, you can get a better deal on cultural if you can supply the raw materials. Go to EQtraders to check the stats and subcomponents.<br />
Another possibility are the grimling caves in Tenebrous Mountains. It's a longer and more dangerous trip, but the acrylia and windstones that drop there sell well in the bazaar. Also, you can check out the rallic pack quest before you go so you know what to do if you see the grimling runner, who occasionally appears before the entrance to the eastern most of the two caves.<br />
In the last patch, the drop rate for spiderling silks also increased. If you want to farm near an adventure camp/PoK book, there are worse things to do that make a run through Everfrost whacking spiderlings, mammoths (tusks sell to vendors for about 10 plat each, as perhaps you already know), and going into Permafrost for fine steel and minor plat.<br />
There are other possibilities for farming as well, but those three can be done at your level/AC/hitpoints.<br />
I'd start doing some farming now, as several pieces of armor could use upgrades. Haste is okay for now, and your mainhand is excellent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baldaran</div><div class="date">12-29-2004, 11:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ignore those who say you should only group. Everyone has their own playstyle. Since you asked about solo places, I'll give you mine at this level. I myself could care less about getting to 65 or 70 in a week. My highest toon is a 57 pally and I've been playing for 5 years this January. I also have a 55 wiz and a 51 war and several lower toons. I've been playing the warrior a lot the last few months and have only grouped him once in CoM a few weeks ago for about 2 hours. I only have about 1-1.5 hours a night to play and a little more on weekends, but I do have a life and a job so I don't like to group or guild. It would not be fair to a guild or group or myself as I play the character I'm in the mood to play and I don't &quot;schedule&quot; my play time. I also take breaks from the game. Sometimes a week or two.. sometimes a month or 2. Hell, I didn't play from February-June of 2004 because I was so burnt out on it.<br />
<br />
The best place I've found since it is once again a hotzone is LGuk. Get virtue and FoS and you are good to go. Also want to have good magic, fire and cold resist as well for the casters in there(all wizzies.. no healers). At 111 SvM and 106 SvFire I resist most of those types. I only have a 77 Cold resist, so those are the ones that hurt me a bit right now.<br />
SolB is also a hotzone right now, but the one night I went there, there were already a couple of groups.<br />
<br />
I get a little more than 1 percent per dark blue kill. I say that because if I kill a couple of light blues and the percentage doesn't go up, It usually goes up 2 when I kill a darkblue. With around 4600+ HP when Virtued and FoS'd, I park myself in the safe hall of LGuk and pull all the mobs 1 by one from north till I get to pit room, and then the first few mobs towards Frenzied. There is a trick to not let the mobs run. I don't believe it is a bug, but I could be wrong. Simply pull to the safe hall, and back yourself up in the corner that turns south under the bridge area. There will be some light blue and green mobs there, but don't make the turn. Just fight and advance on the mob until it gets knocked bact a bit and then back into the cornere again so it jumps forward. I rarely have a mob flee with this. Might be your positioning that counts, but I think that is the point where mobs either flee north or south and the mob &quot;can't decide&quot;. Come to think of it. might be a bug..<br />
Also handy to have a proc'ing snare. I just use a weapon in my offhand I got from one the the front skellies in CoM. It procs Engulfing Darkness(11 dmg per tick for 1 min and snares). With Focus of Soul or Focus of the Seven my dex is well over 200 and it procs on average of once per fight. I rarely need it though as the trick above works great.<br />
<br />
And if you are trying to get levelled fast, there are usually some 60-70 types in there killing for faction that you can get decent exp with.<br />
<br />
One more note about the soloing warrior. You probably know this, but the First Aid AA is great. I've paused at 51 to get a few AA. I got FA1, and I am just about to get RS1. I will probably jump to 52 after that to get the increased stats and get RS2 and 3, and FA2 and 3. I then will probably level to 57(the point when Bind Wounds hits 200 and gives 80 points per bind instead of the 1 for every 4 skill points it does now.. you would get 45 at level 52 per bind(max skill 183 at 52). With just FA1, my downtime is much faster being able to bind to 80 percent. I keep killing mobs till I get around 40 percent and bind away. The sitting regen is also great after level 50(8 per tick in first minute, then 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, etc.. every minute there after) By the time I bind to 80 percent from 40 percent, I only have about 2 more minutes of sitting. I can also kill 4 or 5 mobs before needing to sit.<br />
<br />
If I find a good place at 57.. 1 percent for every db kill, or even every other db kill as my pally has in Sebilis right now, then I will probably stay there until I get at least my defensive archetype AAs. Yes, I know AA percent flows better at 65, but as I stated above, I'm not in a hurry, and that's my personal playstyle. More power to you if you want to get to 70 and 600 AAs in a month, but just not for me.</div></div><hr />
