<br />
I was The Main Tank for my guild back in ToV days but I took a year off and now my gear AA and Skills are too far behind to be useful anymore.<br />
<br />
I replaced my gear and I am working hard on AA’s skills but I still find I am loosing Agro in Groups, any suggestions?<br />
<br />
Here is my profile<br />
<br />
<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=606276<br />
<br />
Not shown in magelo is that I have a SoD with Anger 2 and a Anger 2 in my SeM<br />
<br />
I have (from memory)<br />
<br />
Combat Agility 3<br />
Combat Fury 3<br />
Combat Stability 3<br />
Finishing Blow 1<br />
Flurry 2<br />
Physical Enhancement 1<br />
Planar Power 5<br />
Ingenuity 1<br />
Planar Durability 1<br />
Punishing Blade 2 (might be one this is from memory)<br />
<br />
I was thinking about getting Flurry 3 then ferocity or Weapon affinities looking for input.<br />
Was also considering selling the SoD and getting a BoC with anger 3</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Otheuym</div><div class="date">04-13-2004, 07:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well if you want to be MA you need to finish off your defensive AA I think but first I think you have to get AT so I would get:<br />
<br />
Area Taunt<br />
Planar Durability 3<br />
Lightning Reflexes 5<br />
Innate Defense 5<br />
Sturdiness 5<br />
<br />
And then would start with offensive ones like <br />
<br />
Weapon Affinity 5<br />
Ferocity 3<br />
<br />
Then depending on what you are doing DWing or 2 hander<br />
<br />
Punishing Blade 3 (if 2hander)<br />
Ambidexterity (if DWing)<br />
<br />
Then other offensive AA like Flurry, crits, TM, SE, and things like that</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Finish off your defensive aa's first for sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Otheuym</div><div class="date">04-14-2004, 12:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I still think you should get them in the order I said but you can put off Area Taunt until you want to start MAing but you still need all of the defensive ones I said as soon as you can. Sturdiness is probably actually the best over all but I put it last cause it is the most expensive costing 60 AA to max it out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shirion</div><div class="date">04-14-2004, 03:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Do lighting reflexes then innate defense.</div></div><hr />

why do people say LR5 over ID5?  i went ID5 first, and had no problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neksnappa</div><div class="date">04-14-2004, 06:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">People go for LR5 first over ID5 because parses show that you take less damage with LR5 overall than if you had ID5. The benefit ID5 has going for it however is less/smaller damage spikes. (Think /disc def versus /disc evasive- with higher mitigation ie id5 and /disc def, you get smoother damage. With avoidance ie lr5 and /disc evasive, you still get the spiky rounds of max hits on each swing) Both of them are important AAs to get, so as long as you get them both eventually, you're golden.</div></div><hr />
