<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bleet</div><div class="date">08-10-2004, 10:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am regearing my old warrior who got sac'd down to 46, I have gotten a few pieces so far but I still do need a few suggestions. <br />
<br />
First question being, I have a boc in mainhand do I  need to worry about getting another agro proc in offhand ( currently has horn of hsagra in offhand ? )<br />
<br />
Most slots I will probably just put fierce heraldic but I am looking for ideas for shoulders, bracers , gloves and possibly boots ( non ldon options please since those slots are currently empty and I would need to put something there before i can go do ldons )<br />
<br />
I have 400k  to spend unfortunately there isn't much fo sale these days or it is way overpriced (170k for velium encrusted gaunts, 240 for helmet of rz ,300k for one crystalized acid bracer etc )<br />
<br />
So any suggestions you may have for the above mentioned slots would be appreciated, I will probably get mostly cultural but I would like some other options that I may have overlooked.<br />
<br />
I'm sure these posts get old and repetitive and some people may not like twinks but either way any input would be appreciated<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

after lvl 50 put another aggro weapon in your OH (CHoS is a good an common bet in bazzar).<br />
<br />
<br />
post a magelo (even with empty slots), to get more accurate suggestion.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">08-10-2004, 12:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well almost 3kHP at lvl 46 with 5 slots missing (more if counting charm and ammo), it's not bad. I would say go for the Helmet of Rallos Zek, even at 240k it's the best buyable helm so will last you till lvl 65 or so. FH is enougth for the rest since they are sold at less than 10k, you should spend less than 300k on your 400k for five slots and stat food. then you can play around in ldon wihout fear.you can start again to farm plat to refund you. <br />
your other slot are ok for now, come back when you will be lvl 55+<br />
<br />
<br />
NOTE : when you will bet stronger (more lvl) you can start to quest the katta shield (but keep the cloak in your bag, you may find some use of 25 CHA situationally). the quested pouldron from the hole isn't bad either.</div></div><hr />

Id do HoRZ and then Fierce Heraldic in all visible slots. If you have plat left over I would swap out Soulscream for Heavy Rubi Girdle and use tribute haste.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bleet</div><div class="date">08-10-2004, 04:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the suggestions, I will see if I can find someone making / selling the heraldic armor. <br />
I do have one other question, since offhand procs arent as frequent would it be a waste to get say a sod or something as opposed to just copper hammer? or maybe a anklesmasher or something with a debuff type proc?</div></div><hr />
