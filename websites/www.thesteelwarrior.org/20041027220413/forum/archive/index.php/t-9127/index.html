There was a lake near the school and lots of ducks in it. Obviously the ducks were used to people giving them bread; they'd walk right up to you.<br />
This cheered me up quite a bit. Until then I was worried about running out of money and not having enough to eat. But bread-fed ducks, a little wire noose...<br />

Certainly Mr. 30 Posts, I'll go away because you say so.  I just can't face the half witted come backs of people who's IQ matches their shoe size.   Yeah, right.  That will happen in this life time.

If Kerry were Satan, he'd have a MUCH bigger lead in the polls. Bush couldn't compete with the real deal. <br />

And people are attracted to evil. On the scale of evil Satan would be ... the election wouldn't even be in question.<br />

That it is a tight, close race, just shows how much of a real poltical dogfight the election is for once.<br />

Some serious issues. The debate was quite interesting tonight. Finally a time to get away from the stupid tv ads and the mindless talking heads that run the news shows that cover this nonsense.<br />

p.s. I think Bush is too liberal too..aka he has increased the size of government and greatly outspent what we can afford, bancrupting this country for future generations..  A classic old liberal policy (but fortunately not something modern liberals seen to embrace see Clinton).  <br />
<br />
I find myself agreeing Pat Buchanan alot (his new book is actaully very interesting); paleo conservative values have been lost (fiscal conservatism and a non-interventionist forign policy) by the Republican party.  Lots of hate but no common sense for moderates.<br />
<br />
I liked the debate. The reference about &quot;BUT YOU FORGOT ABOUT POLAND&quot; had me laughing hysterically.  So did the new polish navy or the old polish navy help us?</div></div><hr />

I believe it has something to do with the rising demographic of americans meeting that qualification as well.<br />
<br />
After the debate, if I was Bush, I'd just come out and say &quot;Look, I'm a fucking idiot.  Quite frankly, anyone who supports me is a fucking idiot too.  But, follow me here...who better to represent idiots than an idiot?&quot;<br />
<br />
He'd actually probably see an increase in the polls after such a move.<br />

The bright side of all of this is that I'm hearing reports all over of record numbers of people registering to vote, and you don't register to keep the status quo...you register because you want to change things.  Bush is going down.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
40 percent of parents who dislike 30 percent of their children prefer George W. Bush. <br />
• <br />
60 percent of households that fly flags think America can do no wrong 26 percent of the time. <br />
• <br />
70 percent of women who think Mr. Bush is more likeable than their husbands prefer John Kerry. <br />
• <br />
52 percent of people with wall-to-wall carpeting dislike Mr. Bush's plan for redecorating Iraq. <br />
• <br />
98 percent of people who are hearing-impaired like 50 percent of what they hear from Mr. Bush. <br />
• <br />
100 percent of Spanish-American War veterans are dead. <br />
• <br />
98 percent of World War I veterans can't remember the name of either candidate. Both prefer Coolidge. <br />
• <br />
43 percent of women think Mr. Bush has more presidential hair. 26 percent think John Edwards has more vice presidential hair. 47 percent think Mr. Edwards has more presidential hair and 26 percent think Mr. Kerry has more vice presidential hair. 92 percent think Dick Cheney has no hair. 73 percent think Mr. Bush's hair is irrelevant. 54 percent think Mr. Bush is irrelevant. <br />
• <br />
76 percent of women think Teresa Heinz Kerry colors her hair. 53 percent of those women would prefer a different color. 42 percent would prefer a different first lady. <br />
• <br />
One-half of all Jewish mothers like one-half of Mr. Kerry. <br />
• <br />
63 percent of single women over 50 think John Kerry is too tall for his own good. 71 percent of divorced women say George Bush would be an ideal ex-husband. <br />
• <br />
Before the Republican convention, 86 percent of the population thought Zell Miller was a professional golfer. After the convention, 92 percent of the population would not like to be in his foursome. <br />
• <br />
50 percent of the electorate think that polls are misleading, inaccurate and inconclusive. The other 50 percent agree 30 percent of the time with 40 percent of the results.</div></div><hr />

 Let's boil it all down here. Kerry is going to take the Northeast, barring some catastrophic event happening to either candidate. Bush will take most of the South, Indiana, and most of the West, guaranteed. Kerry will take Illinois, Minnesota, Michigan, possibly Ohio, and the West Coast. Either way, it's going to be a virtual repeat of 2000, with a possible change in which state is the key one that splits 50-50. Hell, it may be Colorado and that funky proportional split that decides. Either way, ignore the national polls - it's a dead heat, it's been a dead heat, it's going to be a continual dead heat unless one or the other steps on his dick in public.</div></div><hr />

And that guy will win right?  :D  I mean, if he CAN step on his dick, that's a pretty big dick.  And we Americans love to elect people with big dicks...</div></div><hr />
