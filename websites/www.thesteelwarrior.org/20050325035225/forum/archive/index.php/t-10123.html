Back to the same old question as in EQ; what are all your opinions on choosing HP over AC, or vice versa?  For myself, it's merely a personal preference, but I'm big on AC.  Also, does anyone have information on how much more spirit actually helps?  I know it apparently helps regen faster; but as I don't have much added spirit on gear, by swapping a couple of pieces in and out I haven't been able to see any difference, but it's something I've been wondering if I should really work on improving. <br />

I believe that once you get to around 7k armor at level 60, the mitigation benefits aren't really worth it anymore, although I haven't gotten near that point yet. HP never caps, and from what I've heard, stamina doesn't cap either, so you want as much of that as you can get once you near the soft cap.<br />
<br />
As for spirit, it's not too big of a deal for melee. The regen bonus is okay, but it only works outside of combat (with the exception of under certain circumstances with a talent), so it really will only help with downtime while soloing. It's good to have, but don't sacrifice armor or HP for it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks Kokonut, altho I should have specified; I'm only at level 42, and that's after playing a lot more over the holidays than I usually play.  Getting level 60 is going to take me a fair while yet :p  I'm more concerned with levels previous to that, where AC is NOT capped yet.  I'm only at around 2k AC or so currently, so the cap is something I don't have to worry about for a while yet.<br />
<br />
And thanks for the info on spirit; it more or less confirms what I already thought.<br />

There is no need to guess at all, even in light of whatever cap that exists unless the information you get on mitigation is wrong.<br />
<br />
For example if I have 1000 HP and adding a shield gets me from mitigate 50% to 60% then that's exactly the same as adding 250 HPs ((1000/0.4 - 1000/0.5) X 0.5).  Given melee damage in WoW has a pretty small interval AC and HP might as well be the same when it comes to melee damage.<br />
<br />
Now of course there's the stuff that doesn't get affected by AC but does get affected by HP to worry about, but that's another issue.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Er, what ?<br />
<br />
That kind of reasoning is silly, even if you are soloing and never group and never get healed and never use any healing potions or bandages or food, mostly for the reason that 99.99% of all fights do not go to zero hp.<br />
<br />
A better metric would be - an extra 10% mitigation means that where previously I killed a mob and ended up with 1000/2000 hp, I will now end the same fight with the same mob at 1200/2000 hp, whereas if I had an extra 250 hp I would end it with 1250/2250 hp.<br />
<br />
If you end a fight with more than 250hp then the extra 250hp are doing absolutely nothing for you. Well, that's not strictly true, they do provide a very small buffer to be being executed by annoying execute equipped mobs ;p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">12-29-2004, 10:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">HP does matter because unless you regenerate all the HP you lost between walking from one mob to another without needing bandages or food there is always room for improvement.  There's nothing that says you have to start the next fight at max HP if you can win a fight without full HPs.  <br />
<br />
Now obviously it'd take you longer to get all the HPs you lost if you've lots of HP but no mitigation, but as far as I can tell, bandages/food give HP back fast enough that you'd never have to worry about a situation where you've so much HP you've to sit down a minute or two to just get it all back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">12-29-2004, 10:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">those extra 250 hp that you had left over would come in handy if a mob called in a friend to beat on you as well.  It also helps against nukes where AC isnt even a factor afaik.</div></div><hr />

Assuming you're not dealing with instant casting nukes, nukes are usually not too hard to deal with using shield bash, at least the first time.  And if stuff has instant nukes, I tend to avoid them since there's plenty of normal mobs to fight that don't have instant nukes.  The only stuff I've fought so far with an instant nuke are the air elementals in Arathi and I really don't see any reason why you'd ever want to fight those guys unless you just want some extra pain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">12-29-2004, 11:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thats a pretty big assumption in instances where you tend to get a good mix of caster versus melee.  Plus, until you get talents, your shield bash only shuts down that line of spells so it doesnt completely shut down the caster.  Then there's the 12 sec reuse.<br />
<br />
Hehe I can think of one WICKED ass reason to go kill air elementals in Arathi, the warrior quest 'The Cyclonian' that you get after you do the Brutal BP.  The result is a warrior only two hander (axe, mace, or sword your choice) that is freakin awesome.  We're talking a 35 dps weapon in your low 30's if you got some higher level friends to help you.</div></div><hr />

Shield bash is a 50% spell stopper, at best.  It stops spells for 6 seconds, reuse is 12 seconds, and it only puts down 1 school of spells, IF you hit with it.  It's not a guaranteed deal.  It helps deal with casters somewhat, but it's not a be all/end all solution.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, since you don't know the importance of fighting the Thundering Elementals in Arathi as a warrior, I don't want you to talk anymore about what you think of the design of this game anymore (IE: outhouse thread a couple days ago) since you clearly can't judge the content based on not experiencing it :p<br />

Finishinng up my Whirlwind Axe tomorrow morning.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have a spell on my sham called Earthshock that breaks what they're casting and shuts down the line just like bash. It still doesn't do shit to hinder them unless you're disrupting a heal, and the spell works everytime assuming they don't resist. Hell the best part of it is the fact that it's also like a 150dd, which shield bash isn't last time I checked. Since shield bash is a gimped version of Earthshock I can't imagine it being anymore effective.<br />
<br />
Also, spiff on finishing the cyclonian Haas. Only have about half of mine done so I'm jealous, hopefully I can finish by this weekend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">12-29-2004, 03:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Err, just because you need to kill some mobs that are obviously harder than anything of the same level (even their regular cast spells are way faster than normal nukes, on top of the instant Shock) for a particular quest doesn't mean this is the kind of thing you're expected to do on a regular basis.  Or do you say 'hey those elementals that are harder than anything of the same level sure was fun, let's kill them again!' once you're done with the quest?  Most people tend to learn to avoid things that are excessively difficult for no reason whatsoever.  <br />
<br />
For example take a Drywhisker Kobold in Arathi, it's a level 35-36 melee mob with no special ability and runs at 30%.  Now take a Boulderfist Brute, a level 35-36 melee mob that doesn't run and does about 2.5X DPS at will with Fist of Stone.  So do you go around basing your gear/playing style around a level 35 mob that can suddenly hit like a mid 40s and therefore bring about 50% more HP/mitigation/whatever to every encounter because a particularly powerful level 35 mob exists, or you can realize that almost every other level 35 mob is just a level 35 mob and plan around those instead.   On my server I see the kobolds more or less permanently camped by way too many guys, and no one ever touches the Ogres unless they got a quest there or they're someone who can get to the Magis easily (super easy kills).  The game revolves around boring mobs like the kobolds, not stuff that are actually somewhat difficult.  Besides the stuff that are difficult (i.e. instances) you're supposed to have a group and you shouldn't be expected to have all the answers.  Yes if a quest happens to say go kill 25 Boulderfist Brutes you might have to replan your current setup but even quests don't usually send you fighting large numbers of undercons for long.<br />
<br />
Shield bash will work about half of the time not counting misses, that's why I said it'll work the first time.  Mobs outside of instances rarely have more than 1 line of magic available.  Only the frost mages with kite AI are of any threat and these aren't exactly common.  Casters in instances comeswith bigger variety, yes, but like I said before instances are a group effort, so you shouldn't expect to be able to deal with them just by yourself.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're right Phantron.  Why should I quest for a 35dps axe when I can just use the bullshit 18 dps crap that drops off Drywhiskers?<br />
<br />
Stop with the EQ mindset dude.  You may have been top of the game there, and able to get away with making broad assumptions about everything in the game, but you're not here.  You don't sit around &quot;Fighting things that are easier at your level&quot; just because they're there.  You move around and fight where you're directed to fight because THAT'S HOW THE GAME WORKS.  You wanna play grind central, be my guest, but that's obvious how the game wasn't intended to be played, and it's obvious that you're going to be fighting many different types of mobs rather than just the ones you want to fight.<br />
<br />
If you want to go thru life avoiding everything because it has special abilities, well then be prepared to have the crap gear that comes with it, because the good stuff you have to work for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daeos</div><div class="date">12-29-2004, 04:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So do you go around basing your gear/playing style around a level 35 mob that can suddenly hit like a mid 40s and therefore bring about 50% more HP/mitigation/whatever to every encounter because a particularly powerful level 35 mob exists<br />
Why wouldn't anyone be geared up to their full potential in the first place? If you can kill level 35's that hit like mid 40's mobs, then wouldn't you just shit-kick all the average gimp level 35 mobs in the zone that much harder? <br />
<br />
I think I'm a little confused on when we went from Hp/Ac comparasin to a debate about whether shield bash is good against casters. It's all situational and I don't see how it's relevant really. If you're in defensive stance fighting a caster with a shield, then shield bash until your fingers bleed from button mashing and you pass out from exhaustion, but will I go out of my way to shield bash casters? I highly doubt it.<br />
<br />
I'm still going whatever talent build holds agro best, and it's looking like that's going to be defensive. Seeing as how most of the abilities require a shield and my dps will be gimped anyway I might as well use one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">12-29-2004, 05:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You don't do harder stuff because it is more rewarding.  You happen to be fighting some pretty tough elementals because a quest with a good reward points you that way.  The elementals themselves don't drop anything better than any regular mobs of the same level.  After you're done with the quest there is no conceivable reason you'd ever want to fight a Thundering Exile over a plain old level 38-39 mob unless there was nothing else to kill.  I looked up the drop rate and it'd look like ~20 Thundering Exiles would do the trick for what you need, so because at some point you need to kill 20 Thundering Exiles this somehow makes HP more important than AC becaues for those 20 Exiles with their instant Shocks, AC is obviously not as useful as HP?  This is the whole EQ Chaos Claws myth of avoidance over mitigation all over again.  You setup your character so that it works 95% of encounters, which consists of boring normal melee mobs and casters that are trivially interrupted.  On the 5% that this doesn't work, hopefully you've enough intelligence to compensate for the encounter being different.  <br />
<br />
And eating special abilities that most of the time have no counters to act like a tough guy isn't how to play a game smartly.  Maybe you feel compelled to hit every mesa buzzard on your way so you end up with a -8 spirit debuff that lasts forever, or you just feel the need to veer off the road every time you see a Thundering Exile to see how well you can deal with their 200 damage instant Shocks.  As far as I can tell, most people don't do that, because it's not the smart thing to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">12-29-2004, 06:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, you're already a lost cause discussing things with in this game too.  If you can't see why you're not making choices on what mobs you kill, and how questing differs from grinding, then I'm not gonna waste any more of my time talking to you about it.<br />
<br />
You and I never agreed on anything in EQ either, so don't know why I'm surpised.  You just go ahead and do what you're doing, because clearly you know how everything works in this game too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
My point was not that hp are not good - they are, that's obvious, but that HP and AC simply are not directly comparable as you suggested.<br />
<br />
Whenever you are receiving healing it's a nobrainer in favor of AF, whenever you are being nuked it's a nobrainer in favor of hp, when you are beating up random generic melee mobs the scale varies depending on how close to death they take you, but is weighted more toward AF than HP solely for efficiency reasons.<br />
<br />
In any case, the question is mostly academic - it's rare you have to compromise AF for STA or vice versa, a better discussion is probably on the merits of STA vs dodge % or STA vs agility/strength etc.</div></div><hr />
