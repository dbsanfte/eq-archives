Unbuffed Str is 250 and Unbuffed Sta is 267 Agi/Dex both near 200 but I easily max all 4 stats out with full raid buffs.  Just looking for some input thanks :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">07-16-2003, 02:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since you will be able to max STA at 305 with shammy buffs, its a matter of doing the math to determine when you should go for PP. To max PP will cost you 15aa so I would imagine that you should get ND3, PE, and maybe a level or 2 of CA/CS before putting points into PP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Changes things slightly. ND3, CA1, CS1, PE, PP5</div></div><hr />

Your only getting like 20hp per rank from the raid stamina increases. where Planar Durability, gives ya about 100 per rank.<br />
<br />
PD = 3 levels at 3 a peice = 9aa for about 300hp<br />
<br />
PP = 5 levels at 2  a peice = 10aa for about 100hp .... <br />
<br />
you figure it out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grimmlokk</div><div class="date">07-17-2003, 12:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd finish CA/CS before PP. And LR and ID also.<br />
<br />
 PP is for making your Magelo ranking climb a little bit. The HP from it is pretty minor, and the other stat gains are too. I only maxed mine when we got our free flag points.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Look at the abysmal gains you get from stamina post 255...20 more hp is not worth anywhere near what CA/CS would give you, and even tho I don't have ID/LR yet, I'd still pick up those first too.<br />
<br />
So you can get your stats to 305.  Big deal.  You really don't gain anything noticable from doing so...and you can spend 10 points in places where you are going to see something noticable.</div></div><hr />

Why would anyone take PP until you've finished up AET, ND, CA, CS, LR, ID, PE, PD, etc? Even then I'd probably go for dps AAs before PP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
tested this last  last night<br />
with ND3,PE,PD3...<br />
<br />
Wearing a Helanic tundra bracer - 50 hps, 5 stamina, stamina was 257, had something like 7033 hps.<br />
<br />
Switched to a Ornate Bracer - 45hps, 6 stamina, stamina 258. had something like 7027 hps.<br />
<br />
Exactly 6 less.... well by changing the bracer if stamina was the same I should have lost 6 hps... but stamina went up by 1.... so I am really confused as to what is happening here..<br />
<br />
Seems like I am getting less than 1 hp per stamina...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">07-18-2003, 12:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">About 2 reformats ago, shortly after PoP came out, and before I took my EQ break, I had screenshots saved of me at 7005hp with 259 stamina wearing an iksar hide cape -- 75hp.  I swapped that with my shammy's Heiro Cloak (4 stamina 75hp), which would obviously put me at 260 stamina (level 61).  I had 7005hp.<br />
<br />
That told me right there that anything over 255 was borked, and a complete waste of time to worry about.  In fact, simple logic pre 61 dictates that a 10 stamina item beat out a 5 sta 25hp item (1sta =6hp), but now that i'm over 60, I consistently get more HP from my Sarnak War Bow than I do from my idol of the thorned.  It's fucked, and it's fucked in a big way, so I'm not sure why anyone would care about the miniscule gain when there's other AA's that would be far more useful to buy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">landrain</div><div class="date">07-18-2003, 01:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Too bad we arent casters and complaining that the extra wis/int from AA's to 355 are not giving us more mana...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raunstonecutter</div><div class="date">07-18-2003, 09:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I max sta at 280 pretty easily.  The only way I'd got for Planar Power is if I had maxed every other useful AA aside from war cray and bandage wound (can you feel the sarcsim?).<br />
<br />
From what I know:  25sta @ 4hp/sta post 255 = 100hps.  I think I'll start a parade!<br />
<br />
25agi @ 7agi/AC = 3.5AC (I suck at math and don't use calculators)<br />
<br />
Those are the two stats that remotly mean anything.  So IMO, nearly every other AA &gt;&gt; PP</div></div><hr />
