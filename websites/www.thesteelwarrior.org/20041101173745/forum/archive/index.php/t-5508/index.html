<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Elokl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have recentley found out that I am possibly the worst shaman in the world lol........so I decided to re-gear my 30 Ogre war and make him my main..... any suggestions on where to hunt either solo or grouped from 30-46 would be awesome</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Frig Coldheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well from 30 to 40 Overthere is a real good spot. I had alot of luck there. Normally plenty of groups. At 40 I would say move to Dreadlands. Others might have some Luclin era suggestions. I went thru those levels pre luclin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Elokl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">yea most did.... i did to with my shaman its just hard now adays finding anyone that is my level range let alone finding a group =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Even today OT and DL are good zones to get groups in, I think. That's where I leveled my warrior a few months ago, and even post-LDoN there are lots of folks around. Furthermore, warriors are in demand in my experience (at this level casters are beginning to see the advantages of someone else getting hit, lol). It's nice to go through 15-20 levels and never wait more than a minute and a half for a group (enjoy that while you can). Just bring your bow, hotkey shield, hold agro and position mobs and people in these zones will beg you to come tank for them.<br />
The main disadvantages of these zones: they have no experience modifier and they are both wide open outdoor zones, and hence provide you with no experience fighting in dungeons or dealing with tough-to-break spawns. <br />
You also, in my experience, won't get much practice grouping with chanters in these zones. So, if you level here and don't have a lot of experience with dungeons or with chanters, be aware that those are things you will have to learn later.<br />
Especially in OT there are a good many players around who are not only just beginning to learn their class, but apparently just beginning to learn to be human beings. Expect classic pick-up group problems, heh. Oh, and do make sure that everyone knows what goons are, particularly if you're a warrior who doesn't like to zone before his casters are safely zoned. Remember once calling zone when a goon came by. One group member said, &quot;Why? There's just one of them.&quot; Needless to say, there wasn't just one of them, and that caster didn't make it to zone, and neither did I, lol.<br />
The reason these two zones are so popular is that fighting there is not especially difficult. More interesting and riskier zones like Splitpaw do have a modifier, and are more challenging. They are also completely empty, so you'd have to bring your own group. But you probably won't be able to convince a group to go to places like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Elokl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">DL seemed kinda empty when i check it out today im gonna check OT today</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nokatsu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you're having trouble finding groups then you will need to find the popular zones for your level range.<br />
<br />
/who all 30 35 lfg<br />
<br />
will list where other people in your level range are located who are looking for a group. A lot of people don't use /lfg, so you might try:<br />
<br />
/who all 30<br />
<br />
A lot of formerly popular zones become deserted when new zones become available with better experience modifiers.</div></div><hr />
