<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Prytty</div><div class="date">09-23-2003, 08:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey all.  My guild has recently entered VT and I've been going over loot tables deciding where I should spend my DKP.<br />
Currently, we're in the opening stages of farming TVX spawns since they're not highly contested.<br />
What I'm wondering, is what, if any TVX loots should I bother with that I wont kick myself for getting as we move deeper in.  Probably my most pressing need is haste, since the stats on EoES suck, followed by neck/back/face/feet upgrades.<br />
Also, most of the mods are new to me too (aside from the Veng on my Ornate bracers) so I dont want to pick up an early upgrade of AC/HPs then feel the need to replace it 6 weeks from now when a comperable item with lets say a riposte mod drops.<br />
Thanks in advance for any advice!</div></div><hr />

Stuff you might want to look at<br />

Vindicator / Tormax / Ornate / LDoN etc etc<br />

Good necks are rare  AC20/25 hp85 41% is godly.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Prytty</div><div class="date">09-24-2003, 07:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks!  Helped quite a bit. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Choppin</div><div class="date">09-24-2003, 09:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gorget of Superiority is your definite best bet for haste. UNLESS you have a shot at Aten neck, go for Cord of Midnight.<br />
<br />
In EP's (and 1 tier lower), good neck, face and waist items are hard to come by. Most have shitty low AC. <br />
Examples: <br />
Belt of Mastery (35ac 125hp) vs. Cord of the Pyre / Girdle of Earthen stability (both 18ac 140hp). I'd probably even keep Belt of Mastery over Coirnav belt if I had the choice.<br />
<br />
Gorget of Superiority (25ac 80hp +haste) / Talisman of Vah Kerrath (35ac 125hp) vs. Necklace of Reflected Flames (15ac 135hp) / Fire Marked Rune (20ac 125hp). I'd take the Fire Marked Rune here, but it is very rare. I don't really want a necklace of Reflected Flames, the AC isn't good enough.<br />
<br />
Crimson Runed Mask (50ac 125hp) / Cloudy Steel Mask (20ac 125hp) vs. Great Mask of Flame (20ac 150hp) / Baroque Mask of Sol Ro (20ac 135hp) / Fine Hammered Faceguard (18ac 140hp). Now see here, neither the Fennin mask, AoWind mask or the Sol Ro mask are better than the Aten mask, and they're minor upgrades to the Cloudy Steel. Sucks, no?<br />
<br />
If I had known, or rather given it more thought when we were farming VT, I'd have gone for the Gorget, Crimson Runed Mask and Belt of Mastery. Didn't have a shot at Aten neck, as it was pre-awarded each time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dovan</div><div class="date">09-24-2003, 12:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Seriously wanna probably look at snagging an cloak off the TVX's.  Hell... they're actually pretty common, so you'll kit out most of your warriors pretty quick.<br />
<br />
Cord of Midnight ain't a bad thing to look at, the gorget I've found are snatched up usually by hybrids in a heartbeat.  Though as mentioned above, the Belt of Mastery is something you might really want.  An optional way that is well with in your reach is the shroud off Blob 1.  It's basically a baby doze shoulders with haste.<br />
<br />
Other than that, umbricite bracer is alright if you didn't snag a bracer off XTC.  If you do have an adamite wristguard, just sit back and wait for something else later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Warram</div><div class="date">09-24-2003, 04:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Let your other guild members waste dkp on TVX mobs, Pryt. The only item you'd ever want from those mobs are the haste neck. Save the rest of the dkp for leggings of firey might, helmet of shadow &amp; AHR loot...Gloves of Warding aren't very popular but I'll take 15 sv all and 125hps anyday ;) <br />
<br />
 VT is mega DKP drain, so don't get caught up in the fact that everyone is upgrading but you (like I did) and hoard your points for the good shit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trast</div><div class="date">09-25-2003, 04:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Believe it or not three very sweet warrior items drop off the Thall Va Xakras; Cloak of Icy Shadows, Cord of Midnight, and Umbracite Bracer. Out of those three the best of the picks for you seems to be the Cloak of Icy Shadows. Great hitpoints, clicky damage shield and five saves versus all resists. <br />
<br />
Otherwise you are better off waiting for other mob drops unless you want to upgrade your haste with a Cord of Midnight. Suggestions I could make would be the Gloves of Warding and the Leggings of Fiery Might of Thall Va Kelun for other big upgrades(nasty mob, a true test for a guild.) The first floor Diabos generally have very little to offer a warrior, Ring of the Crimson Bull being one of the few exceptions. <br />
<br />
Oh my fellow evil doer mentions the Dark Wind Shroud off of Blob One. Don't hold your breath on that one as its a rather rare drop. If you can get lucky and have enough dkp to get it though its a must have item. As you've got 41% haste already its not a huge concern for you yet. Concentrate on weak points in your slot and you should do fine. <br />
<br />
For more info see your friend and mine Darkwind item database (http://www.darkwind-guild.com/SoL/)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Prytty</div><div class="date">09-25-2003, 04:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye, the cloak is sweet.  One dropped today which went to a Ranger.  I think I'm going to hold out for the haste neck before anything else since it will allow me to equip another Bloodmetal Earing, shoring up two weak spots, statwise.   After that, maybe the cloak then whatever else down the road, dkp permitting.<br />
Again, thanks for the advice, as it's much appreciated. :)</div></div><hr />

For haste either the gorget of superiority or cord of midnight are good.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raaj</div><div class="date">09-25-2003, 10:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know you asked about TVX loot, but the only decent thing off them really is the cloak. From vt though, you want:<br />
<br />
Talisman of Vah Kerrath<br />
Crimson Runed Mask<br />
Great Shadow Platemail<br />
Gloves of the Crimson Sigil<br />
Leggings of Fiery Might<br />
<br />
I'd let the rest be. These 5 will last you all the way to time, or at the very least elemental. Grab haste boots from emperor, or a cord of midnight like someone else said and those will last you until elementals as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Choppin</div><div class="date">09-25-2003, 10:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why would you want to let Belt of Mastery be?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raaj</div><div class="date">09-25-2003, 10:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah yeah forgot that one. Thats another great item from VT.<br />
<br />
Though, if he ends up with a cord of midnight he won't be able to use a belt of mastery without losing haste.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Veldriss</div><div class="date">09-25-2003, 10:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dunno, I'm kinda partial to Earring of Eradication. ;p<br />
<br />
If your DKP system doesnt reset to 0 every time you take a loot, definately wait for Dxxt/Kelun and beyond loot.  Taking those few key pieces already mentioned will mean you can spend your DKP in other areas and get all-round well equipped.</div></div><hr />
