<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bluenet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Diety got the better of me...I re made a Tribunal Barb War with The cultural stuff from my 55 dorf of brell.<br />
<br />
Since the rec lvl nerf are there any weapons that are decent for aggro? Or should I just hold a lammy + Frostbringer?<br />
<br />
I dont think SboZ is really worth the 30k it costs on my server...for a war at least.  Blackened Acrylia blade is 15k.  <br />
<br />
What are your guys' opinions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">dont reroll ... play up to lv 65 with your dorf.<br />
<br />
i'm agnostic, and i feel your pain.  i pushed on through to 65 and gear came my way rather quickly that is easily on par with cultural.  with the weapon nerf, its just not worth it unless you have a team of lv 65's to PL you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>lanolar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think you should play your dwarf and be happy. You will replace that armor anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bluenet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">thats just one reason...<br />
<br />
I have a aa point in innate dex my friend put in.<br />
<br />
I cant get it removed and it bothers me to have a single aa in innate dex /cry<br />
<br />
Im weird.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">lol in the time it takes you to level up from 1 - 55 again without significant PLing, you could be level 65 with several aa's to make up for that 1 &quot;wasted&quot; aa.  50's are the shittiest of all levels.  your halfway through them now, and i wouldnt turn back if i were you.<br />
<br />
besides, cultural armor wont give you the full stats till lv 45 anyways /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Bluenet: Change the avatar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Valnir Lanys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Theres absolutely no reason to re-roll for you.  You're level 55, thats so close to being done leveling.  Keep the dorf, /hug your dorf rolls and enjoy playing the game.  When I was 55 the best stuff in the game was cobalt...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It's never worth it to reroll. The time invested &gt;&gt; any disadvantage that your race/starting stats has created. Innate dex isn't even a bad thing, and AAs will roll in later. There is armor as good or better, though not as widely available. Be strong, you can do it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bluenet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Avatar changed, sorry about that.  I have an immoral sense of humor.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your suggestions.  Ill sleep on this decision before I regret it later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If it helps you any, <br />
<br />
I've played an agnostic through the diety armor phase and into Ornate, and can say that there isn't anything I truly wish I had right now that would make me consider starting over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Greklak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If you feel strongly enough about rerolling then do it.  It's better to have doubts and do it now than to trudge on through the final 10 levels and then regret not doing it 10 levels and endless hours earlier.  You'll spend TONS more time leveling from 55-65 and beyond than you will leveling from 1-55 again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>ThornyEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Your reasons for re-rolling are weak; don't do it. Post 60, 1 AA (what you &quot;wasted&quot; on innate DEX) comes in an hour or so...you'll have so many AA's that you'll be &quot;wasting&quot; them on innate DEX and such anyway (plus DEX is not a waste, more DEX = better chance to proc). Likewise for cultural armor: you'll be replacing it sometime anyway. In the end (and you're a lot closer to the end at level 55 than at level 1) it won't matter much. Spend the time you would have spent getting another warrior up in levels by doing LDoN's instead; that'll net you some nice armor that puts most cultural to shame. You'll also be a lot closer to 65.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I would advise not to start over; I'm sure re-leveling to 55 would outweigh the advantages of the cultural armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Dont start over, my deity is Mithaniel Marr (dont laugh) because back in the old day I thought the whole Honor roleplaying was great :D<br />
<br />
I had to put up with not having a good cultural, but I didnt mind, there are other great pieces of gear, I never bothered too much about having a crappy made-for-Pallies cultural. And about wasted AAs... I dont think any AA is wasted... unless you put it in Innate WIS :p AAs will fall from the sky when you lvl up some, dont worry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tithus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I'm with Ealsur on this one.  I thought rp'ing a Mith Marr warrior would be cool when I started him back in 2001.  As bad as I thought it was to not have decent cultural, there absolutely no way in hell I'd go through any of the 50's again just to get some armor that will be replaced rather quickly.<br />
<br />
Bottom line, cultural is nowhere close to endgame armor.  Nowhere close.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kavak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I see two options:-<br />
<br />
If you are in no rush, give the lower level warrior a try, and if you find after a while you can't take the levelling anymore (wild horses could not drag me through 50-65 again as a warrior without power levelling at his disposal, I would first reroll another class) go back to your main. <br />
<br />
If you want to get to 65 asap keep your dwarf. Its harder to get the equivalent of cultural as an agnostic/insignificant god worshiper but a level 65 dwarf in lesser armor &gt; a level 55 warrior in cultural.<br />
<br />
<br />
Having said all that, personally having made 3000 alts in this game over the 5 years I have played (and even though I often grumble about cultural armor as an agnostic) the best advice I can give you is to not make a character based on loot. You will burn out on it fast. Play the race you want to play. The penalty is not large enough to where you cannot do your job.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Taggen_of_Xev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Iksar warrior, I rest my case on the diety stuff :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Evariste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Had a Froggie warrior (Mith Marr diety - found out too late that simply the diety range slot item takes care of some of the HP/STA problems) and I rerolled at 54 to a Barbarian Tribunal for HT. Even with a two-boxed druid, it took me 4 days /played to get back to where I was before. <br />
<br />
If I added 4 days /played to my old warrior, I'd bet I'd be in my 60's now, well on my way to Ornate or Sand. I'm wishing now that I could change my mind and take those days back. <br />
<br />
Having 255 STA and 4k HP at level 54 is nice (about 500-600 more than my old froggie had) but the curve will be corrected for me soon. <br />
<br />
Bottom line: don't do it. I've been down that dark path and now I'm spreading the word.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>yawp64</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I have to agree with all the posters who have urged you not to re-roll. <br />
<br />
Stick with your original character and turn the unusual things about him into something fun. In my case, I play a half-elf Tunare worshipping warrior ... (waits for laughter to die down) ... and part of the ongoing challenge is finding ways to do my job effectively while still having a great time. <br />
<br />
Good luck!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>czai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Don't reroll.  Make a list of upgrades you can concievably buy or camp with friends.  Ornate armor springs to mind.<br />
<br />
I  started my war years ago as agnostic.  It's not as easy to go into the bazaar and buy your armor, but after awhile that doesn't matter.  If you look hard enough, there are upgrades out there.</div></div><hr />
