<br />
My request is this:  Could someone please post either typical or favourite song set-ups for groups and raids??  I'm not entirely sure what stacks with what as listed on Lucy, etc.<br />
<br />
Ie. Raid - AoE Elemental Chorus - Raises C/F/M by x with y drum or z with epic??<br />
<br />
Maybe that's a bit specific, but these boards have helped answer specific questions in the past, so I figure hopefully you can again.<br />
<br />
I've also read numerous threads discussing the massive DS's availble through Bard songs, but other then Warsong of Zek, could you toss some names/lvl's required around??<br />
<br />
Thanks so much,<br />

<br />
If you want to see how much resists are raised with Elemental Chorus, first look at lucy, see which instrument type it is.  Then look at whatever instrument type your bard has there.  Usually they use epic, which is a 1.8 modifier for all instruments.  So basically, multiply the number from lucy, by the modifier (1.8 if epic), and there you have the amount resists are raised.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ibash</div><div class="date">04-30-2003, 05:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My main is a level 57 Bard so I will try my best to cover some ground for you.<br />
<br />
It is hard to really hard to say this is a cookie cutter of a song list thatt works in all situations. Cause as you know most of the time there is some class missing and the bard will try to fill in that gap if possible. Only if we can have that perfect group all the time. =)<br />
<br />
Perfect group: (shaman, cleric, bard, chanter, warrior and paladin)  formation 55+.<br />
<br />
I would play these songs while using my drum since there is plenty of melee (DPS).<br />
<br />
<br />
 &lt;-debuff-&gt;<br />
 Occlusion of Sound - Level 55 = Target:Decreases MR, CR, FR; Unresistable; Lowers resistances by about 20 with normal drum and increases with level, and is enhanced by magical drum<br />
        <br />
        &lt;-haste-&gt;<br />
 Verses of Victory - Level 50 = Increases STR(30), AGI(30), AC(21), Attack speed (30%) for entire group<br />
<br />
        &lt;-break the haste cap-&gt;<br />
 Battlecry of the Vah Shir - Level 52 = Group Haste; Stackable with Enchanter/Shaman haste spells, allows you to exceed the current haste cap by 15%<br />
<br />
        &lt;-I play this just for good measure-&gt;<br />
 Shield of Songs -- Level 49 = Group Damage Absorption (prevents x points damage per tick); Absorbs both magic and melee attack. This song starts at a 20 damage point rune sung, 40 points with lute. Increases with level, averaging about 70-80 points.<br />
<br />
      &lt;-then I throw in chants for extra DPS-&gt;<br />
 Tuyen's Chant of Disease - Level 42 = Decrease Hitpoints (HP) by 22[L42] to 33[L65]; Decrease Disease Resist by 12[L42] to 18[L65]; <br />
<br />
 Tuyen's Chant of Poison - Level 50 = Decrease Hitpoints (HP) by 26[L50] to 33[L65]; Decrease Poison Resist by 14[L50] to 18[L65]; <br />
 <br />
<br />
That is a perfect group scenerio. Now if there are classes missing like take a Shaman for example then I would throw in a slow song right after the debuff song (Occlusion of Sound). If some melees are missing I can and will tank but I would soak up way to much mana then I am worth.<br />
<br />
 Largo's Absonant Binding - Level 51 = Decrease Armor Class (AC) by 15[L51] to 19[L65]; Decrease Attack Speed by 30[L51] to 35[L65]% ; Decrease Movement Speed by 52[L51] to 66[L65]% ; Decrease Agility (AGI) by 45[L51] to 52[L65]; <br />
<br />
<br />
In Raids there is only two songs (other then what was already mentioned earlier) that I find myself playing in the song twist.<br />
<br />
 Elemental Chorus - Level 51 = Increase Magic Resist by 42[L54] to 47[L65]; Increase Cold Resist by 42[L54] to 47[L65]; Increase Fire Resist by 42[L54] to 47[L65]; Increase Armor Class (AC) by 1; <br />
<br />
and<br />
<br />
 Chorus of Replenishment- Level 58 = Increase Hitpoints (HP) by 12[L58] to 13[L65]; Mana by 12[L58] by 14[L65]; Decrease Stamina Loss by 10;<br />
<br />
I hope this may help you understand how I play my 57 bard in a group or a raid. Opinions will vary so take my advice lile a grain of salt.<br />
<br />

<br />
1. Debuffing Occlusion/harmony of Sound, the various chant dots that also have a debuffing component. this helps the mob get slowed and nukeage land more readily.<br />
2. Mana (stating the obvious)<br />
3. Resists: AE MR/FR/CR or  MR/PD/DR, PoV for grp only, MT grp or cleric grp usually. with resists at 500 most things are resisted (dunno about impact in PoF and PoW since ninja)<br />
4. MT grp, overcap haste, damage shield, AC, resists<br />
5. DPS grp, aka 5 rogues and a bard, overcap haste<br />
6. Nukage, if u have rizlona adds upto 15pct to DD stacks with all focus items<br />
<br />
hope this helps<br />
and yes hit the bard sites, lotsa information to be had there</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">weoden</div><div class="date">05-03-2003, 02:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">a bard and shaman make a nice base to any group.  war/bard/sham/cler/rog is an excellent group for most camps.  Bard mez is a bit weaker(higher level required) than an enchanters mez but if your xping, you can get an fd puller where the bard can't mez.  Also, with a 41% haste item + shaman spell haste + bard haste + bard over haste... well you dont need enc haste.<br />
<br />
A bard can play resist songs and probably cap your resists at 500 with average resist gear.<br />
<br />
bards can slow and slow/snare but this has a bunch of aggro to it.<br />
<br />
haste/over haste is nice and i do notice a diffence.<br />
<br />
a mezzing bard generates less hate than a sitting jama enchanter does.<br />
<br />
bard so some dps.<br />
<br />
bards tend to start out playing 4 songs then 3 then 2 then you wonder if there afk...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Darn you...I resent that! <br />
<br />
Just keep in mind that some songs will never show up in your Bard Songs window at all. Like the DoTs (chants), OOS = Occlusion of Sound (debuff), bard snare and slow ect ect. Just because your window is showing no activity doess not mean that the bard is not singing a song.<br />
