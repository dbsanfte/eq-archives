<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>nyyhte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am level 46 and have noticed that I can no longer solo the level of mobs I used to. I think this is something that naturally occurs as you level but it might be that with my higher # of hps my Iksar Ceremonial bp cannot keep up like it used to. Here's my question (I am relatively poor, all my $ is in my gear) should I ditch the ibp? or should I hang on to it, it still cranks out quite a few hps and my normal group of friends is often relying on a pally for healing. Thoughts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Give us a magelo and we will think more. But yes it will become far less useful as you level, as even a regen of 50/tick would not be noticed much when fighting things that hit for 500 on average.  This maybe more of a question for PoN as the question is how much does this help pally healing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
relying on regen to win a fight sounds pretty dicey tho hehe, i would think its mainly a downtime thing.</div></div><hr />
