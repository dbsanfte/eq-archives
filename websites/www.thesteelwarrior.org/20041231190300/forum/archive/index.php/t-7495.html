Where are these things?  Are they only at higher levels and if so, what level do you start seeing them?  Or are they something that only drops as rewards from task force missions or something?  Someone clue me in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">06-08-2004, 02:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You buy them. From the stores in Talos Island or Independence Port. They're pricey, but at 23 you should have some influence squirrelled away I hope.</div></div><hr />

I found them, but only after I'd spent most of my 220,000 in influence on DOs.  I picked up a few, but still wish I'd known they were there before making my purchases.  Major Doh!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">06-09-2004, 12:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh. No worries. There'll be plenty more influence where that came from. I didn't discover the DO stores until level 14. We all make goofs.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">06-09-2004, 12:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can't use DOs until you're like 12 anyhow, so that's not a huge loss =P.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">06-09-2004, 12:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">True. But I still felt silly not knowing where the stores were for all that time. I mean, I would walk right past Subgenetics, thinking &quot;My what a pretty sign&quot; and I just didn't know. Heh.<br />
<br />
;-)<br />
<br />
EDIT: Oh yeah! Another dumb move! On my third alt to ding 12 ... I could have sworn the character's origin was natural. So I blew 30k influence on DO's only to find out the toon was SCIENCE. Hah.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fitemore</div><div class="date">06-09-2004, 01:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">LOL! That's a little worse than what I did... I was removing enhancements at 12 to replace them with DO enchancements... So I was dragging and deleting, dragging and deleting, dragged a DO damage enchancement I just bought and deleted... Thought to myself, &quot;WTF is wrong with me...&quot;</div></div><hr />
