<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Timmok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was wondering if anyone else have this problem or know a solution:<br />
<br />
After the patch whenever i hold down the right mouse button to look around(using mouse-look) it is very slooooow, and i have to move the mouse all the way across the pad to even change my view 90 degrees.<br />
<br />
I have mouse-sensitivity at 100%. I have typed /mouse 5 in game. The funny thing is that my mouse pointer moves across the screen at turbo speed with the /mouse 5 setting. The slowness only occur when I hold down the right mouse button.<br />
<br />
It is as if EQ ignores the mouse speed setting once you hold down the right mouse button. Very annoying :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i had problems with my trackball similar to yours; but i found out i didn't have the right settings for it in my Logitech tolbox ( it has it's own mouse accelerator ) and it made it slower than normal no matter what I set it as in EQ..</div></div><hr />
