<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Werekin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I tell ya, sometimes ppl just burn my arse.  Like I ate chili peppers or something.  No to preface this, I was only in Karnors to help out a friend monk with Pawduster, plz no flames for going to that accursed zone.<br />
<br />
We are sitting in pawduster for a good 6 hours by the time I hear this guys voice.  He shouts, &quot;52 Pally WITH KEI lfg!!&quot;  I see this, and reply, not to his detriment or anyone elses, &quot;Its a sad day when a melee type needs KEI to be considered for a group&quot;.  I figure I complimented this guy with calling him &quot;melee&quot; right?  He starts sending me tells about &quot; You have so much time to spare you bust my chops?&quot;  And other stupid ass things like this.  I tell him no, its my opinion that any melee type should need to include buff list to be considered, still no negative statement towards him at all.  He sends me a tell then, &quot;I got a lvl 60 cleric and a lvl 57 warrior, I know how to play this game.&quot;  So when does that mean you know how to play, and when did I question his ability or lack thereof?  Moral of  the story=1 less person still playing his warrior that makes the rest of us look bad.<br />
<br />
P.S.-- A couple minutes later, a druid zoned in, &quot;55 DRU LFG&quot;  My immediate shout was, &quot;Do ya have KEI?  Noone groups without it&quot;.  He atleast knew how to laugh........</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ibash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Pally's used mana to cast...hence KEI is applicable in that regard. I personally don't think I would get KEI if I was in situation but...<br />
<br />
/shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">heh I still remember the twink back on TT yelling &quot;Level 9 WAR w 520somethingAC 98osomethingHP's LFG&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Carnican</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">As a Pally, I wouldn't even do that...<br />
<br />
Anyway, PoTG is even enough mana regen for a pally that needs to step up and tank.  <br />
<br />
KEI is needed to support a group for heals in an encounter that needed protection from AE's or keeping rampage tanks alive.  But to /shout LFG w/ KEI is a little silly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">yo carnican you from TM? MK right?<br />
<br />
dang pally. haha jk we gotta get that ringwar.<br />
<br />
anyways on topic. it's sad that they have to state they have certain buffs to be accepted into groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Yiktin Voxbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Couple of nights back, was getting No LFG Lovin' so swapped to me enchanter. Sat in the nex fer 3-4 hrs<br />
/ooc casting C1-Gift of Magic-Plus int/wis buff @ per class requirements, donations NOT Accepted.<br />
<br />
Yanno, in that time I had mebbe 8-10 foilks come fer the buffage, whilst others sat inzone (in 1 case fer an Hour+) Lookin fer KEI<br />
<br />
I hate what that 1 spell has done to the minds of People that play EQ, not that I blame them though, is awesome mana regen but the game is still playable even with this most humble of brain buffs to help.</div></div><hr />
