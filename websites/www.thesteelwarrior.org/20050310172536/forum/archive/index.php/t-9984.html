<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pelidorn</div><div class="date">12-10-2004, 05:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I currently have a level 70 Warrior on Drinal. I have played EQ almost 2 years for 3 to 5 hours a night every night from 8pm to around 12pm Pacific time. As we all know that is not a good time slot to get into Uber guilds or do much raiding. I could not even get into Nightraid to try and progress in the planes. My regular group of friends and I have been grinding in OoW since it came out. I only buff to 10.5k and 1700 AC and have mostly ldon and some OoW armor pieces and crappy weapons. <br />
<br />
So when EQ2 comes out and I bought it for my wife (she plays a beastlord on same server in EQ)  and so I played around on it one night and was hooked. The graphics are nice when I dumb them down for my non uber system and content is easy to follow. So I go and buy my own copy and start fooling with it while my friends on EQ are logging on (usually start around 9pm pacific) and I really enjoy the questing and killing. Now I realize that we could easily solo in EQ until level 20 or so, but we all remember how long it took farming bear or wolf pelts to get a crappy armor piece with no stats and very little AC. <br />
<br />
Now I start talking to my friends on teamspeak about EQ2 so they start trying it out and like it as well, now we have all got mid teen toons in EQ2 and play together during our normal times and have lots of fun. Now we are stuck in the dilema that many are I think. Drop our toons we took years to level and start over,   try to play both or drop EQ2 now while we still can. <br />
<br />
Im not a casual player as far as play time a week, but I am in my mind because I cannot progress any further in EQ without significant time investment and frustration since I cant tank content higher than MPG named. <br />
<br />
Can anyone please help me to see the correct path for my EQ gaming. And what are your feelings on EQ2???<br />
<br />
BTW I am currently a 14 Dwarf Brawler on EQ2 and having fun with a new class.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">12-10-2004, 09:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well one advantage of EQ2 over EQ1 for off-timezone players is that raids are capped at 4 groups I believe.  So reaching the end game won't require collecting a 100 man guild.  that plays in your time zone.  I believe EQ2 is more solo friendly than EQ1 as well, although grouping is still the most efficient way to get exp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hahaha.<br />
No.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
In EQ(1), most classes could solo to 20 or so, then it gets progressively more difficult for some.<br />
<br />
In EQ2, all classes can solo to 20 or so, then it gets progrrssively more difficult for all of them.<br />
<br />
Equality of a sort, I suppose.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think the main question you need to ask yourself is have you done what you wanted in EQlive? If you can say yes and your happy with where you progressed then make the move. If you are one of those folks that have an attachment to their toon and can't get on with the thought that they have logged in for the last time then stay in EQ.</div></div><hr />

I was recently in the same situation (except it was WoW instead of EQ2) and I decided to go with the game that I was having the most fun with - which was not EQ.</div></div><hr />
