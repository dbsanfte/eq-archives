<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gerald</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There's one thing you can get to summon arrows... a mage twink to drop them on the ground for you before yous tart playing your warrior :p. That's about it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Bracer of Hammerfall summons throwing hammers, not arrows.<br />
There is no warrior usable summon arrows item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">and you can't shoot the hammers with your bow anymore :(<br />
<br />
man i loved that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tugurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Those stupid hammers have a range of *25*, which is less than proximity aggro in many cases. I was stoked when I got that bracer, before I realized how totally useless it is. If the range were only 50 even it might have a value.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>kandaur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Dang, well that sucks....( <br />
<br />
thx for the info!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Binnamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Just make your own. You can buy a stack of all the cheapest componants for less then 1pp (something like 5 gold and change iirc) And just get your skill to 20. Carry around a few stacks and you shouldn't really run out very easily, unless of course, you are playing ranger.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have /feedbacked &quot;Put a warrior-useable summon arrows item in the game&quot;  at least 50 times hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Heh, so have I Brutul.... now if only they would listen. :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Varaho</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Screw clicky arrow thingy! I want a &quot;Hammer of Thunderbolts&quot; $$<br />
<br />
You know the kind in D&amp;D that came back to your hand after you threw it, with stats and a nifty proc?<br />
<br />
That would own, hard.<br />
<br />
And 'sides they would up the piercing cap to 250 before they put in a summon arrow thing~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Zhisz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=8200 could work I guess. Hate always having to ask for arrows. Would loose some stats in range slot though :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gerald</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">If you take that pouch over a monk they will murder you and then turn your body into a protein shake.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Grendonbb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I recently bought a Tolan's Bracer... for no better reason than to hand off to a ranger in my group so he can summon me arrows, since they all have sold theirs with Endless Quiver being out.  I usually end up tracking down a LFG ranger, handing it to him and getting some arrows, or if no rangers about, then just asking a mage /shrug.<br />
<br />
Oh, and I also carry a stack of components to make Class VI Steel Silver Tip Arrows... kinda expensive, but they train my skill up, and I've never been into &quot;class 1 steel wood tip arrows&quot; and the like.  so if worse comes to worse, I can just pump some out and use them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gerald</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Here's something of interest. There's a pouch from Plane of Time that apparently summons 250 range shurikens that have lots of stats including 185 hp. May not be summoned arrows but it's pretty damn close :p.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Fynepisa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">That pouch rocks. I just picked one up. You have to buy some reagent at the wayfarer's camp to use it, but you can get a stack of reagents for like 9pp. Each reagent will summon a stack of arrows and the arrows are not no rent. Definately pick one up or do some mistmoore adventures till ya get one.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>mishratm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">There is an item that ive seen for sale in bazaar on legends server that summons 1 stack of arrows per click. It's about 10 sec cast time. Dropped in LDoN event. Only seen the one so far though</div></div><hr />

HOLY CRAP ARE YOU SERIOUS?! OMG OMG From the looks of this thread, you answered our prayers!!!!... except that this thread is 3 months old and everybody knows about the pouch now! Way to go!<br />
==============================================<br />
<br />
I took the time to fill n this thread for future purposes for those warriors that don't come here everday. Atleast now the thread is not left blank, its finished and ready for those that in the future need good info and resources..that's the point of this board last time I checked.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Galdaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I picked up one of those Bloody Ancilles Pouch in MM last Wednesday.  I was thrilled to say the least. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Gerald</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">You've been under a rock if you haven't heard about the Ancille pouch. Plus there have been much newer threads about it specifically titled new summon arrow item etc, so that makes no sense that you did it so other warriors wouldn't be misled.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Asharad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">No reason to be snotty about it.  The guy was just trying to be helpful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Gerald</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I'll admit my first statement was a bit snobbish and I edited it, but I stand by the 2nd one. There were some lengthy discussions about the said item that were much closer to the begining of the forum.<br />
<br />
I took that stance because people bump old posts many times  because they think it's funny... not helpful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>warcry</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">“You've been under a rock if you haven't heard about the Ancille pouch.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Never once did I say I was posting to stop people from being mislead.<br />
<br />
Yes there are newer threads, but I myself clicked on this one to find more info<br />
<br />
regardless of the date. I don’t always search threads by date, many times I search them by subject relevance.<br />
<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
“There were some lengthy discussions about the said item that were much closer to the beginning of the forum.”<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
The forums maybe, but not this thread.<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
“I took that stance because people bump old posts many times because they think it's funny... not helpful”<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
That’s fine just be careful not to assume to much, I certainly didn’t post here to be funny and bump the thread. <br />
<br />
Who knows, maybe the admin will come by and see this outdated thread and delete it, or maybe not.  Only time will tell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>CedVicious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I missed this post and did not see it its first time around.  I check posts almost daily but will miss some posts when I'm out of town on business.  <br />
<br />
However, now that I've read this post, I am glad it got bumped because it has valuable information I was not aware of and never thought to search for.<br />
<br />
No harm no foul on the response by WarCry.  It was an informed comment that was aptly placed on this thread and thereby ending it.  <br />
<br />
Flaming it and then justifying the flame and then owning up to first flame but standing by the 2nd flame... Kinds of defeat the purpose of not bumping the thread needlessly.  heh heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Binnamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">And 'sides they would up the piercing cap to 250 before they put in a summon arrow thing <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If only that statment was true :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Gerald</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">My second post wasn't a flame and the part about being under a rock wasn't directed at him. He added information to a three month old thread had already been discussed at length in threads dealing specifically with the said item, and he was also using a new account. That to me seemed like post bumping for fun. There's no need to bump 3 month old threads because they don't fall off the edge like on ez-board forums and there's also a very useful search feature here. It's silly to go back and add info to three month old threads unless you solved some mystery that was left unanswered.<br />
<br />
And now for something helpful... there are also a quote button at the bottom of a person's post if you wish to respond to them with the message board automatically quoting them in your own post. Just saving you some time.<br />
<br />
Not gonna justify myself any more. This is old let this thread die now :p.</div></div><hr />
