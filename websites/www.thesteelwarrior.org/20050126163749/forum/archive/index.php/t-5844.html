<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cister Battle</div><div class="date">02-24-2004, 12:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I searched for similar threads but didnt come up with anything.  If I missed anything obvious, then allow me to say Im sorry in advance.<br />
<br />
I am currenly using SotB and SboL.  These only allow 1 single type 4 aug.  I was thinking going with the Force of Ykesha on each for the DD + stun effect.  Would you suggest or go with the Anger?<br />
<br />
Also, I havent noticed many weapons to have many aug slots open at all.  I dont know of the high high end weapons but there really isnt a 1hs in LDON outside of the MM sword (which is inferior to both of my weapons currently) that will work.  I am a slash type of girl so I dont do the blunt stuff.  Call me dumb but I like to stick with my concepts and clubs just dont do it for me.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your assistance in advance</div></div><hr />

Anger 3 is the most aggro, and Force of Ykesha is decent aggro with some extra DPS. If you raid, get anger 3. If you mostly just group, Ykesha will probably be better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Qest</div><div class="date">02-24-2004, 01:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd suggest Anger lll if you can afford it for 1-handers.  I'd suggest Ykesha for 2-handers for DPS.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that Ykesha augs are LORE so you'd have to get different Ykeshas for Primary and Secondary.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ealsur Helevorn</div><div class="date">02-24-2004, 09:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I always thought that 2 Anger II augs (one on each hand) would be much better than 1 Anger III, and at lesser cost. But thats just me, a non hardcore high end warrior :) Of course, if you have the points, just buy two Anger III, but I wonder why 400 hate is worth 510 points and 600 (only 200 more) costs more than double that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cister Battle</div><div class="date">02-25-2004, 09:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Would you suggest Anger III in primary (since it has stun proc already) and Ykesha in offhand or vice versa?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frax</div><div class="date">02-25-2004, 10:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If these are weapons you may replace soon i'd go with anger II, you get 2/3s the effectiveness of anger III for 1/2 the cost. If you can afford to re-obtain angerIII when you upgrade I'd get the anger III for primary.  Just depends on how many LDoN points you can afford to burn off (or burn off twice if you upgrade).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cister Battle</div><div class="date">02-25-2004, 11:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok sold me.  Is Anger III a proc or just a constant effect?  If it is a constant, wouldnt it be better to be in offhand so primary could proc more?<br />
<br />
Also, I read somewhere the Ykesha proc only works on mobs 55 and below.  Not sure if that is true.  If so, then it would only do 125 DD -10 resist magic based damage.  Would the 150 DD -25 resist cold based damage be better?  Or maybe the 125 DD -10 resist poison based damage?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frax</div><div class="date">02-25-2004, 12:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">AngerIII = Enraging blow with less hate (600 vs 700) and should proc the same amount.  The ykesha proc does work on any NPC, it just does not stun any over level 55, but the DD compentent will still land.<br />
<br />
If you want pure agro, AngerIII is the best augment, and put it on your primary weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">02-25-2004, 12:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The power of the Ykesha proc isn't the DD part, it's the 0-second stun that goes along with it.  The stun won't land on 56+ mobs, but the agro associated with it still carries, so it helps you hold agro.<br />
<br />
So no, a 25hp increase with no stun is not better.</div></div><hr />
