<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">02-17-2004, 01:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So my guildleader got a Blade of War last week, first one in the guild.  The next day on a raid he was MA on yard trash and I found that I had to bag my bloodfrenzy or I was pulling aggro constantly.  Now it wasn't really a fair comparison because I was using 2 EB weapons with Anger III and I have WA3.  He hadn't auged the BoW yet and has no WA as far as I know but it got me thinkin.<br />
<br />
Back when the BoW first came out, it was considered the best aggro in the game.  It was a lower proc rate than BF/BoC...say 2 ppm vs. 4, but the extra DPS was enough to make up for the 2 lost procs.  I wonder if augments have changed this.  <br />
<br />
For example, with an auged BoW you should be able to get 4 ppm without weapon affinity, but with an aug'd BF/BOC you should get something like 7, so now you're giving up 3 ppm to use the BoW.<br />
<br />
Assume that WA5 is a straight 50% (little early to say this is 100% true but it seems about right) and now you get 6 ppm from the BoW but 10.5 from dual wield, so you're giving up 4.5 ppm to use the BoW.  Is the extra dps from the BoW enough to make up for 4.5 less procs a minute?  I kind of doubt it.<br />
<br />
Now I know that there are other reasons to use a BoW, dps and lower ripostes specifically, but I have to think that with augs and Weapon Affinity the edge goes back to BF/BoC from a pure hate standpoint.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm thinking you're right on target with this. Even if the number isn't exact, I think that the aggro comparison is correct. For straight aggro purposes, DBotW/BF and a good aggro offhander, both augmented would easily win out over a BoW. However, I'm thinking that an augmented BoW with a goodly amount of AAs will more than suffice for normal functions. <br />
<br />
  Slightly off topic, what would be the best aggro setup right now? DBotW mainhand, BF offhand? EoE offhand? Something else all together?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Uukla</div><div class="date">02-17-2004, 03:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think another issue is that the BoW benefits greatly from flurries, for agro.  If you dont have Flurry and punishing blades, the lack of extra attacks is going to make the BoW be less of a weapon for agro than you hear about on the boards.  (from people who have max offensive AAs.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">02-17-2004, 03:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guildleader has a BoW, I have auged Hategiver and BoC.  In my experience the BoW has much better agro at the start, before you start proccing, but over time I generate more agro.  If Bes attacks about when I do, he has agro, but eventually it will switch to me.  BoW I feel is still a better choice simply for lower ripostes, and higher DPS, and more reliable agro(as much of BoW's agro is from DPS, not procs, and we all know how streaky procs can be).</div></div><hr />

We didnt get a BOW with our kill but I am still gonna get mine cuz I much prefer 2handers to dual wielding.</div></div><hr />

I only have 60ish AA's right now....  I take agro from equal warriors no problem. I think I have the best agro weapons on my server as none has better then a BoW as no one has DBoTW or anything like that yet.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also its not often I lose agro to my wizards chain casting draughts and ISoS, thats some serious DPS to be keeping agro from but its all based on the rng... but with 4 very good hate generating procs (and one in the mainhand 25percent over normal) one will go off soon enough.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kilaara</div><div class="date">02-19-2004, 02:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The BoW is THE BEST weapon to aggro AND survive the fight against bosses. <br />
<br />
Thats it. Its without a doubt that several dual wield weapons can reach the all around aggro generation of a BoW.<br />
<br />
BF with HG/BOC/..<br />
BBotE with HG/BoC/<br />
<br />
In groupfights when you have lots of casters to interrupt dual wield is sometimes more handy than a BoW ..<br />
<br />
Butt all ppl. who are on the way to catch a bow are in a positon to fight 3 k hitters and there is each riposte a point for a LOADING ... .<br />
<br />
In my guild ( now phase 5 Inno left ) we have some BoWs but more warrior with equal gear. The MTs are always the BoW wielder. Plane and simple fighting with these fast dw combo = better chance to be dead = bad for the raid.<br />
<br />
But when I read lots of comments about the aggro of weapons I think that ppl. forget the most important factor: The Player.<br />
<br />
A good player with nice weapons will always be better in aggro than a bad one with a bit better ones.<br />
<br />
So the discussion if BoW is or not is .....<br />
<br />
Plane and simple .<br />
<br />
You wanna tank da big ones in da elementals ?<br />
YES = BoW<br />
No = Non Aggro DD weapons / each aggro weapon you want.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, not really. Let's say both weapons have 2 effects, a built-in + an augment on each.<br />
<br />
So you have 4 procs. But the offhand only procs at about 1/2 the rate of the main hand, so in effect you get 1.5x the procs as a two-handers, or half-again in slang terms :)<br />
<br />
But the particular weapons take alot into consideration of course, and which procs are the built-ins and are both augd with anger (a II and a III) for add-ons, etc, ratio, etc.</div></div><hr />

I can't recall even one occasion where I ever lost aggro to him.  If you have BoW with anger3, 200+ AA's, you're really not going to loose aggro unless someone else wants to take it.  Yes, someone dual wielding EB weapons would be defined as &quot;someone that wants to take it.&quot;  There's no way I ever use my BoW unless I want aggro, especially not with weapon affinity now.</div></div><hr />

I cant use my sews while there MTing or i end up ducking all the time...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agro is very streaky for both of us. He usually wins, but not by much.<br />
<br />
With Weapon Affinity &amp; Sinister Strikes i am sure dualwield will totally own 2H handers.<br />
Unless we find some crazy/tweaked 2H.</div></div><hr />

Having two tanks equiped this way would sure make switching MT easier for mobs you want two defensive Warriors to tank. Let BoW equiped start as MT, run through defensive, and pass aggro to dual equiped Warrior who would then take over and pop his defensive.</div></div><hr />

AE taunt, followed by fortitude, followed by incite, followed by defensive/evasive makes it nice and easy.  Way off topic, but what the hell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">02-20-2004, 12:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd say the dual auged BF/BoC combo will outagro an auged Blade of War over time, but at the cost of less dps, more ripostes, and less AC.  Dual wield combos generally always have more HP.<br />
<br />
Aside from the miniscule stuff mentioned above though, I don't see how you can go wrong with both.  The beauty of the Blade of War is the sheer amount of dps you put out while tanking with it.  Once Defensive ends and you're tanking a fast hitter, those ripostes add up, especially if you have Double Riposte+.  It's a warrior's &quot;Don't Fuck With Me&quot; weapon.  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
True in a way...but I don't lose agro to a shaman slowing with my BoW, proc or no proc. I think incite may be part of the reason...but with my BBoTE and GBoS or JSoFF, I'd have to get procs to balance the agro from a slow. Holding agro without relying on a proc is just a great feeling ;)<br />
<br />
Now I've aug'd my BoW with anger 3 and am working up WA AA...agro is silly, only high AA rogues with good weapons seem to be able to gank agro over time and it's rare that casters do unless they're nuking from 100%, 2-8 EB procs on a mob tends to make mob glue to me :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zaboo</div><div class="date">02-23-2004, 03:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I used a BF/BoC combo in the past.  When you get proc's, aggro is very solid.  I use a BoW/Anger3 weapon now and noticed that I get aggro from the swing moreso than swinging a BF/BoC.  What does this mean?  The BoW does a better job of gaining aggro before you get that first proc.  Once the proc's kick in, BF/BoC will get you more aggro -- especially since BF has a tuned proc rate.<br />
<br />
DPS wise, you are better off with a BoW.  While DPS is not the main priority of a tank, it's very useful in exp groups when you want aggro AND want to kill MOBs as fast as possible.</div></div><hr />
