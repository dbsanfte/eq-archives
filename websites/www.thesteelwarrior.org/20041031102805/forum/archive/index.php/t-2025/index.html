<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>zrod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was wondering if someone could explain something to me.<br />
<br />
there is the windblade... 50/44? nice stats, 35k+<br />
<br />
                    warmarshal's bladed staff    31/28   anywhere from 7.5 (yes i saw it for that) upwards of 25k on my server.<br />
<br />
having always duel wielded... i don't know too much about the 2hs's in game other then VI at some point made it a viable option to use them instead of duel wielding... well since the WMS was markedly cheaper( i regualarly see them for 10k) i was wondering if this weopon is worth it.  <br />
<br />
 I mentioned this to someone and they made a statement about the delay being as low as it can be for a 2hs(is this in referance to max haste and the minimum delay a weopon can be?) and they also made a comment about the damage bonus not being that great because of the low delay.    their exact quote was &quot; it is a piece of @#$ in my opinion&quot;  and i thought that was a bit harsh for a weopon with a dmg higher then delay.   i was wondering if that person had a point by saying that, makeing me mistaken, or am i right in thinking that the weopon is awsome and the low delay is NOT a weakness (still can't see how it could be )<br />
<br />
i guess my question here is am i making the right assumptions (about the delays and such)<br />
<br />
and what other weopons (2hs ) are out there that are affordable, <br />
<br />
(ex. is a stonebladed axe of dismay worth it? etc) any suggestions would be welcom)</div></div><hr />

&quot;Is it time to ditch the Windblade?&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Oogmol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">In the ultimate, OMG wish I was there to do it myself, someone found a mispriced WMBS for 20pp in the Bazaar on CT server last night. Needless to say, they didn't walk on by.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">This wouldn't be Marshall Zrod, Vah Shir Overlord of Pravus Mortis on Druzzil Ro, would it?  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sarelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The WMBS is the highest dps tradeable 2h-slash warrior weapon in the game.<br />
 Whomever told you it wasn't up to scratch needs to go back to basic arithmetic classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Hyardgune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I loved the WMBS for the brief time I had it before getting a TSBS.  As my 1h weapons were unspeakably bad, switching to 2h was a no-brainer.  If you can afford the WMBS, do it.  dps is good and it isn't terribly bad for aggro.  Whoever told you it was a piece of $#@% is an idiot or has weapons of such uber quality you can safely ignore them as they aren't playing the same game you are.</div></div><hr />
