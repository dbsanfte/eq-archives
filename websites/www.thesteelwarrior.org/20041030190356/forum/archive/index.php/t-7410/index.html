<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thorix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just a quick question.  Was lucky today and snagged this new wep up, Vyzh`dra's Render of Souls (see magelo for pic if u need).   Now I know a 75pt lifttap isn't a ton of aggro, but most of my time is spent grouping and xping as i'm only lvl 59.  Anywho, my question is, when aggro is really needed, would my best combo be BoC/Render?  The stats on the Render blow away my next 2 options of CHoS or SotBS... but those 2 have stun procs.<br />
<br />
Just wondering.<br />
<br />
My long term plan is to snag a Anger3 for the BoC and maybe a Yak on the Render.<br />
<br />
Thx in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valnir Lanys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'ed say you'ed do alright with BoC render.  Nothing out of this world but it shouldn't be too bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Anywho, my question is, when aggro is really needed, would my best combo be BoC/Render? <br />
<br />
  Probably not. Aggro on lifetaps is very low, though the DPS on the Render is good. Off handed, the DPS aggro probably isn't going to outweigh the proc aggro difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">the aggro between render and CHSD would be kinda close but would go towards the CHSD i think, however the stats on render are quite nice (look too!) so id go with render</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Frostpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You said your long term plan is A3 BoC and yak for Render. I think this is a solid plan, and should be good for most exp groups. Render gives you 25ac, 25sta, and 35raw hp over CHoS. <br />
<br />
Also, think the look is terrific. Expect a lot of people askin why you dont mainhand your BF, hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Augmented render would be better aggro than an un-auged CHoS I would guess, but not as good as an auged one.  With an angerIII BoC mainhand and an auged render offhand you will probably do fine for aggro.  It might not be your absolute best aggro setup, but it's not bad at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">screw the difference in stats / agro... I'd use the render just so you dont look anything like all the other warriors running about with ChoS.<br />
<br />
Points for style.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Drachnyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Renderer all the way baby.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Thorix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thx for the input.  Played around with it tonite, procs about the same as the CHOS did, but the tad extra DPS is nice (not to mention the huge stat upgrade).  I think i'll be happy with this combo.  Now for 60+ and more LDoNs for augs!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Decent Ratio<br />
Nice HP<br />
Nice Stats<br />
Useless Proc<br />

BADAAAAASSS LOOOOOOK</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Wulfgaran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I've used a BoC ( A3 ) and Render ( Yak'd ) for almost a year now, The look is badass and good dps.  The main reason I use it over my GBoS is the 25 AC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jarelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I also use the Render and BoC combo...tho I have A3ed my Render but not my BoC...basically cos original BoC that I owned was guild property so I never angered it, then when I got one of my own we reached EP so I'm saving my A3 aug for a 2 hander...but anyway back to the point...with a BoC and A3ed Render my aggro never really has a problem...can tank anything and keep aggro....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I use to use a BoC and Render combo, until I got my bloodfrenzy. BoC/Render wasn't bad, but that was before ldon. So I didn't have A3 on it.</div></div><hr />
