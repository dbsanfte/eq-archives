<br />
How does this strike you, under the front of saving lives, they want to enforce a global ban on ALL fire arms being owned by citizins.(front as in using iraq as an example, but they really want to rape the USA a little to look like they still mean something)<br />
<br />
I really could give a flyin fug about gun control but what i do care about is the UN trying to inforce laws on the world that undermind their rights and privliages, effectivly making the UN the N(ation) <br />
<br />
Im also urked how smug they are over this new plan when its mostly the USA keeping the UN afloat with peace keeping forces and monitary donations to provide plane tickets and the like</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The right to bare arms is one of the fundamental rights allowed for in the Constitution of the United States.  One of the major complaints of the founding fathers towards England prior the the revolution were the controls placed on private citzens with regards to owning weapons.  Regardless of how this right may have been eroded internally, to have an outside force attempt to dictate to the U.S. that private citzens can't keep and bare arms is going to piss some people off.  As far as I am concerned allowing private citzens the right to personal weapons is one of the only things which keeps government somewhat in check and stops it from becoming a pure tyranny.  Yes, I may be somewhat paranoid, but so were the founding fathers and they provided specifically for a &quot;well ordered militia&quot;.  And in the era of it's writing a &quot;well ordered militia&quot; was the common people and the army was a seperate entity.<br />
<br />
If what the original poster says is true, it certainly isn't going to be acceptable to a very large, somewhat paranoid (with good reason) segment of the American public who doesn't trust government to be inherantly benign without some form of counter balancing insentive.  After all, if power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely, then allowing only the government to have arms is incredible power, wouldn't you say?  And eventually there is always someone willing to freely use power to the detriment of the people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">there's nothing really resembling paranoia here.<br />
Yes; I am a gun owner. I own several guns. They are all legally purchased; recorded with the appropriate agencies; and all documentation on them is readily available and the guns themselves are kept locked in a secure container when not in use.<br />
<br />
The Second Amendment; no matter what day, week, month, year, century, etc... still applies to this day. I have the right as a Taxpaying citizen to arm myself within the boundaries of the law for my own personal reasons; and the reasons that were set into law when the Amendments were written.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The most ironic thing about this is that if you really want to kill somebody, or start an uprising, you dont need guns to do it.  They certainly make it easier, but if you want it bad enough you can buy a few hundred bucks worth of chemicals and manufacture enough explosives to get the job done.  Trinitrotoluene anyone?   Also,  the biggest argument against gun control is that the only people who it has an impact on are those who obey the law.  Do you honestly think that a terrorist/political insurgent/drug dealer/bank robber is going to stop carrying guns because they're illegal?  Illegal arms market? Nah, never happen. The U.N. can control who has weapons and who doesnt, what are you worried about?  I mean, look at the good job they're doing keeping terrorists from getting their grubby mits on chemical and biological weapons.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This argument is fundamentally flawed, for 2 reasons.<br />
<br />
1 -- Laws only keep the honest people honest.  If you're not honest, you don't give a crap what the law is, and it doesn't matter anyway.  Make a law banning guns and all it does is take the guns out of the honest people's hands.<br />
<br />
2 -- If I really want to kill you, I don't need a gun to do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">As it's been mentioned many times, gun control laws only take the guns out of honest peoples hands, not criminals.  Now, if guns are taken away from honest people, then criminals will feel more sure that they can attack people without fear that maybe the person they are attacking has a weapon to protect themselves.<br />
<br />
Also, the UN needs the US a lot more than the US needs the UN.  We'd be fine without you, but first 12 year old with a butter knife to come along, and you'll come back and ask for us to save you again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Let me just say...<br />
<br />
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA<br />
<br />
Ok then, after proving itself completely incapable of even enforcing their own resolutions against a single country, the UN intends to impose a WORLDWIDE law controlling personal ownership of firearms?  <br />
<br />
I'll tell you what, as a US citizen, I am concerned about the erosion of 2nd amendment rights.  I am NOT concerned that the UN will take them away though.  The idea that the UN would have some control over personal freedoms in the United States is laughable.  If they attempt to go ahead with this plan, they will only prove their impotence and irrelevance.<br />

Now my thoughts on the issue Glatius brought up.<br />
<br />
I am in total agreement that there is no way in hell anyone is taking away my right to bear arms. I don't have any guns, nor do I want them. But my country (the US) has enough enemies that if this were to pass I have no doubt those enemies would take full adavantage of it. If the time ever came for me to have a reason to want to bear arms to defend my homeland, you can damn well be sure that I'm gonna UN or not.<br />

<br />
Do you live in fear that your neighbor one day can pull out a steak knife and shove it in your brain behind your ear killing you instantly?<br />
<br />
Personally, if I was afraid of every thing conceivable that could kill me, I wouldnt be able to leave my house.  I sure hope you are able to put your steak knife fears behind you and live out your life like the rest of us do.<br />
<br />
I am perfectly happy knowing my neighbor (an old retired man and his wife) has a gun and is willing to use it if some psycho decides to terrorize my family.<br />
<br />
I also feel people that can make mass blanket statements like:<br />
owning a gun, at this day and age, is dumb ass.Show how complete their level of closemindedness can be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Casai,<br />
     If you think that in this day and age, owning a gun is dumb ass,  you clearly don't live in an area where crime is a fact of life.  I have.  And at the time I didn't own a firearm, so I had to borrow one from a friend of mine, and carry it everywhere, I also slept with it next to my bed.   And since even if guns are illegal criminals will have them (criminals are defined as people who disregard the law, so how will making guns illegal deterr them from using them?),  all gun control does is limit my ability to defend myself against people who have illegal firearms.  (and most of the criminals in this country did not acquire their guns legally anyway).  In a perfect world, I could walk down the street in a lower class neighborhood with a $1000 cash tied to my head with a big pink ribbon and be completely unmolested, but I do not live in a perfect world, so I own and carry a gun.  I've only had to draw it from it's holster once, and thankfully have never had to use it, but I am glad I had it the one time I needed it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">watch bowling for columbine althought I dint find the movie all that it was made out to be it does bring up a few interesting facts like that a lot more people die from guns in US, comparing with Canada/England and some other countries, I cant recall off the top of my hand. Crime is and always will be an issue. Average Joe Blow owning a gun does not sound like a solution to me and the fact that you do own a gun(or could if u wanted to) and there is still such large scale of crime just proves that point.<br />
<br />
The point about people able to kill other ppl with bare hands and knifes is laughable. I have much better chance defending myself from knife then from bulet. Not only that but those are not your statements, but instead NRA's. Which is in fact a business and will do whatever it takes to stay in business, like any other organization.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That happens all too often now-a-days.  Yes, people still get shot and killed with guns. Taking away the implementations of violence does not take away the violence.  People who want to kill or maim others will do it, guns or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Hulanta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Yeah... Bowling for Columbine is a factual documentary!</div></div><hr />

Trust me pal, there are FAR more people laughing at you about this :<br />
<br />
which is owning a gun, at this day and age, is dumb ass. <br />
<br />
Than are laughing about the fact that people get killed easily thru means other than firearms.<br />
<br />
Aside from the protection issue, and the 2nd amendment issue, hunting for sport is a viable recreation in many areas of the US.  Even if you can convince all the pussies that gun control is good, you're never gonna sway the hunters who all own their rifles and shotguns legally and use them appropriately. <br />
<br />
This will never happen here anyway because the UN lacks the hand to impose order on anyone, that's why no one is worried about it, and everyone is laughing at the audacity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I knew this would turn into a gun control thread.  To me the larger issue is the UN trying to impose it's will on private citizens all over the world.  <br />
<br />
On the gun control topic, I think that the fact that both the UK and Australia have seen an increase in violent crime since outlawing private ownership of guns, and the fact that the violent crime rate in the US has been going down for many years, despite most states actually reducing restrictions on gun ownership, says a lot about the correlation between gun rights and crime rates.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">You know what they say, &quot;An armed society is a polite society.&quot; :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I'm not for the total removal of guns from the publics hands, but speaking as an outsider from the US I have to say the idea of guns as run of the mill tools with easy access to them is very strange to me.<br />
<br />
Imho guns make it too easy to take a life, just a simple mistake or a small muscular spasm at the height of anger and blammo. It takes a LOT more 'effort' to stab someone with a knife, guns do it by 'magic' you press the trigger and oh, they fall down. Not to mention you've got a much better chance at disarming or running the fuck away from a wacko with a knife than one with a pistol.<br />
<br />
As to the idea that private citizens having access to an armoury keeps politicians honest, well, i have to think Abraham Lincoln and John F. Kennedy might have a few issues with that theory.<br />
<br />
Few things to consider.<br />
<br />
More americans die by shooting per annum than the total of the next 13 developed countries.<br />
<br />
A substantial percentage more American Police Officers shot in the line of duty are killed by their own firearm than by offenders with their own weapons (This is a fact as told to me by an American officer in a previous messageboard discussion (he was Pro- right to bear arms, btw :p )<br />
<br />
Personally I think making Firearms such a familiar tool leads people to consider them as normal and thus there is less hesitation to use them in day to day activity, which i have no doubt leads to many more unstable situations leading to death or wounding.<br />
<br />
Like I said i don't suggest firearms be banned from public ownership but I do feel America takes this a little too far - and suffers the consequences.<br />
<br />
You opinions will no doubt differ :)</div></div><hr />

Hunting is a sport and I am positive there are not that many hunters around period. Other countries have much stricter gun controll and in no way I belive that no one should have a fire arm. I am against the idea of Joe Average with fire arm.<br />
<br />
Also calling Bowling for Colubine a factual documentary is wrong. Its not. Nor is it a very good film in my opinion. I thought that author was spending way too much time trying to persuade the viewer to be angry at NRA and guns and not offer any practical solution to the problem period. Also I dont belive he even was remotley trying to offer an unbiased point of view. It was very one sided movie against guns... Which is wrong way to approach problem. To make a factual documentary it would have to be impartial. I quoted that movie only to use its statistics.<br />
<br />
PS: to Shikari I dont live in US. I dont read pamphelts on that shit. I am voicing MY opinions. I dont listen to rap period.... I dunno wtf you talking about either.<br />

<br />
Casai, if there are not many hunters around, then answer why this happens... Every year, there is a limit on how many people can get hunting licenses.  Every year, every single one of those licenses are bought, and there are many many people who are turned down because of the limit.<br />

a few year back there was a robery at a luby's(place to eat) and the man shot 13 people for the hell of it, it turned out he was a former employee the guy had enough time to put a fresh clip in and start to unload more gun fire, this was horrible, the gun was illigal<br />
<br />
a few year later another luby's was robbed same set up, former employee gone nuts, this time it was in texas, the SoB got 4 shots of, then a customer took out his gun and killed him, no one but the robber/former-employee was killed. i like this instance alot better where the sick twisted SoB was the only one hurt <br />

Of course, the US has more gun crime than the 12 next industrious nations combined.  The next 12 nations make up the population of probably texas, and thats it.  <br />
<br />
Yeah, we gonna have more crime, the numbers will be bigger, cause we have a much much much larger population<br />
<br />
So saying Canada has 1/100 of the crime. ... well, canada has like the population of new york.<br />

<br />
We have more, cause we are bigger, period<br />
<br />
Cut our population down to the size of one state, which is like the size of one of those European countries that you been spouting fixed statistics about, and ill Gaurantee we have less crime.<br />
<br />
When it comes down to it, we are one of the safest countries to live in Per capita, we have less crime.  I'd rather live here than in somewhere like Germany, where men petition other men to come over to be killed and eaten.  Or perhaps you like Japan, where a TV station kidnaps a man, locks him in a room, nakid, with no food, but, they give him a computer, and in order to live, he has to win things on the internet.   Yeah, lets go live in one of those places.<br />

Just for the record I am an American and I am very much in favor of our right to bear arms. That being said. Comments like the one listed above has a lot to do with why other countries detest The United States. To put your comment in perspective what your whole point is We are Bigger We are Stronger and we will kick your non American ass if you try to make any rules for us. The real problem is that we as a country have become so enamored with the the fact that we are the neighborhood cop that we seem to think as a society that we have the ability to make rules and enforce our ways and laws on other societys but if they try to enforce any rules or laws on our country we pull out the we are the biggest and baddest country on the planet. This whole process makes the US have less credibility on a global scale. We feel like we are above the laws of the world and everyone should bow before us. I love my country and I would not live anywhere else but for some odd reason I do not see a whole lot of people trying to look at this from another nation's point of view. I think people could learn a lot from the way we do things here. But just like the smart kid or the jock when you were in high school noone wants to take any pointers from a smug bully. We also need to keep in perspective that we as a nation can still learn a lot from other societies. We are not above the law and to be honest we do not make the laws nor should we that other countries live by. If we want a world more like ours maybe we should start treating other nations as equals and not like our redheaded stepchildren.</div></div><hr />

America's big alright but your average population density is waaay lower than most European and no doubt some of the developed asian countries.<br />

Quick search of the web garnered these figures :-<br />
<br />
Total American Population (current estimate from US census) 291 000 000<br />
Total population of Great Britain (2001 figures) 58 000 000<br />

That's close to 1/5th of the entire US population on a couple of islands slightly smaller than the state of Texas (pop 23 000 000) and (with big parts of Scotland and Wales being mountainous) England alone provides the Lions share. <br />
<br />

I do not live in America, England is where I call home.  To be totally honest I disagree with the idea that someone (I assume you need licences) can walk into a store and buy a handgun of any sort over the counter for any reason (including going out into the woods and blowing away a few dear because its a fun way to pass the time.)  <br />
<br />
I see arguments here about things like steak knifes and certain chemicals and such.  To me, this has always been a flawed and illogical argument.  Steak Knifes were designed to cut up steak not to stick in someones chest.  Guns are designed with one thing in mind, to main, injure and kill.  Its that simple.  OK so removing gun rights doesnt affect the criminal, granted this is perfectly true, however gun rights make it easier for them to get hold of a gun in the first place.<br />

You have to start somewhere.  You have to start looking towards the future.  <br />

<br />
This is wrong.  There is a waiting period and background checks to get a hand gun.  But I know more than a few people I could go see and get a hand gun today without any checks.  The second way is the way most criminals get theirs, because frankly going to a store is more expensive, takes longer, and would get you in trouble if you use the weapon in a crime (can trace it back to you if they find it).  Banning weapons won't change a thing for criminals, because they already get their weapons through the back ways.</div></div><hr />

I think what I am trying to point out is, yes I am sure most criminals get there guns from places other then the local wal-mart.  But these guns do have to come from somewhere.  Having laws that allow for ownership of a gun to the general populace puts guns out there that need not be there.  I am pretty sure you have to keep them under lock and key, but how many actually do do this.  How many are kept in the drawer beside someones bed, just waiting for someone to break in and enter and help themselves.  This will then be sold on in the local dodgy bar or whatever.<br />

There are 3 guns in my apartment right now. None of them have ever been used to main(sic), injure, or kill anything (unless you count paper targets, beer cans, or clay pigeons). <br />
<br />
<br />
This is exactly my point, why exactly do you need 3 guns?  Although they may only have been used to shoot beercans you are using it for something it was not designed for.  A gun is designed primarily to hurt, main and shoot people, its really that simple in my mind.  It seems an impractical weapon for hunting due to the limited range.<br />
<br />
I understand that people like to practice shooting and to hunt game.  I would agree that it would be unfair to remove this right (although personally it is not something I would do.)  To this end I dont see what is wrong with restricting gun use to Gun Clubs, with all guns kept on the premises.  As for hunting, gun lodges where, again all guns are kept in a secure location and brought out for the hunt so to speak and returned afterwards.<br />
<br />
I dont know, maybe its just me but going out and buying a .35 calibre gun to shoot beer cans in the back yard just seems a little insane.  This may not be the only thing you use a gun for, but how many do?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">I am pretty sure you have to keep them under lock and key, but how many actually do do this <br />
<br />
Everyone I know that owns a firearm has it under lock and key.  Of course, these are responsible individials, and they are also not responsible for violent crimes involving their weapons, which is why it would be silly to ban all guns....there are millions of people who own them and use them correctly...you can punish them based upon actions of criminals.  It's like banning all kitchen knifes because some people break into homes, grab a knife out of the block and stab the people who live there and their 3 kids.  It's just not the way to go about things.<br />
<br />
It seems an impractical weapon for hunting due to the limited range. <br />
<br />
Limited range? My dad has taken down deer a quarter mile away with a .306.  Maybe a handgun has a limited effective range, but high powered rifles designed for sport do not.<br />
<br />
Aside from that fact, how far do you really thing you can see whatever you're hunting?  The rifle only needs to shoot that far.<br />
There are millions of bow hunters in the US too...and a bow has a much shorter range than any firearm does, all while maintaining exactly the same amount of deadly force.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">The more easily obtainable a weapon is, the more will 'fall through the cracks' wether via accident, irresponsibility or criminal intent. Also in a culture where people accept ownership of firearms as the norm, the idea of using such a common implement to 'make your feelings felt' is far less alien to your thought processes than it would be to me (for example). <br />
<br />
Over here (UK) the culture is such that guns are for the most part considered dangerous implements that should only be trusted in the hands of experts. Even many criminals (not the hardened ones obviously but still) probably find the idea of using a firearm in pursuit of a crime to be 'a little bit iffy'. Sadly (as with many other countries) that particular bit of conditioning is being weakened I'll freely admit. The fact remains that introducing a gun into a situation ups the lethality of that situation a great deal.<br />
<br />
I can't stand those reality TV programs but let me just quote you a particular bit of 'action' I remember vividly.<br />
<br />
US police officer stops a car with a suspect inside, attempts to make an arrest. The UNARMED perp, doesn't want to be arrested due to his prior record and grapples with the officer, seeking to get at that officers handgun (remember, trying to take the gun away from the officer doesn't neccessarily mean the criminal wants to use it to kill said officer, most people criminal or otherwise are not mad-dog killers). They grapple, the police officer maintains control of his weapon, the criminal flee's. The Officer, no doubt shocked at the assualt (as would anybody be)and running on adrenalin and with gun in hand quite understandably reacts by firing 5 shots at point blank range after the criminal! The commentator notes how lucky the criminal is to get away with just a bullet hole in his jacket!<br />
<br />
This scenario to my mind shows how the presense of any gun ups the lethality of a situation, where the criminal would at best have had a scuffle with the officer (who is well trained and equipped to deal with such less immediately lethal attacks) the encounter became a much more 'life and death' type situation.<br />
<br />
I'll quote again the US law enforcement officer who i discussed this with on another board, who told me that of all the police officers shot in the line of duty the vast majority were killed by their own weapon !<br />
<br />
UK police officers (apart from specialist teams) do not carry a firearm because in the majority of cases there is no real cause to expect to be coming up against one. Dispite our lack of personal protection we don't have anarchy on the streets, strangely enough, we don't typically have psycho's routinely going around trying to top their colleagues with a hand gun either (as Gerick suggests happens fairly often over there, requiring right minded citizens to shoot down the evil psycho), <br />
<br />
...are you sure there isn't a reason for this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">This scenario to my mind shows how the presense of any gun ups the lethality of a situation, where the criminal would at best have had a scuffle with the officer (who is well trained and equipped to deal with such less immediately lethal attacks) the encounter became a much more 'life and death' type situation. <br />
<br />
I gotta take issue with this.  Firearms on our police officers are for a reason.  I've heard it stated many times &quot;Ya, lets see how big of a man you are if you put down that gun&quot; and it's true.  Most of the police officers currently employed in my area wouldn't know what to do with a 6'6&quot; 250 lb guy who used to work as a bouncer at a club if they didn't have something above and beyond what that guy has (namely his fists and a lot of brute force).<br />
<br />
Maybe those kinds of people aren't around much in england, but in the US, there are some BIG dudes, and if they don't want to be put under arrest, they are perfectly capable of preventing that from happening.  I've routinely seen video clips of people requiring 5 or 6 officers to pin them down and get cuffs on them.<br />
<br />
Police officers having firearms isn't a bad thing..it's for their safety.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">LOL, there's plenty of big guys in Britain and the police manage to control them some how, and i seriously think you're underestimating your own officers training levels, useage of pepper spray etc in such situations.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">I tend to avoid this topic like the plague.  Guns laws, like the abortion issue, tend to get very emotional.  Been very pleasantly surprised at the generally civil tone(with a couple exceptions) shown here.  I am going to be brave and offer a couple thoughts.<br />
<br />
Contrasting the US(with very liberal, loose gun laws), and the UK(with very concervative, strict gun laws) does seem to show a definate correlation between legal gun ownership, and gun violence.  There is I am sure more to the story than that, but I cannot help but feel that it is at least a large part of the story.  <br />
<br />
A number here have referred to the second ammendment, without quoting the whole thing.  It reads: 'A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed'.  Supreme courts have ruled, since I believe the 1800's, that the first part of that statement is important, and because of that, the government can impose restrictions on gun ownership.  A couple examples are fully automatic rifles and sawed off shotguns.<br />
<br />
Part of why I think this issue generates such 'heat' is a loud bunch at both extremes of the issue.  The NRA takes some extreme positions(opposing any new limits on gun ownership, and having opposed such things as banning 'armor piercing' ammunition and taggants on chemicals that can be used to make explosives) and has such an active following among nut groups(living in Michigan, I have met more than myshare of Michigan Militia freaks).  Alligned against them is are anti hunting groups and ban all gun groups.  Very few people actually support banning all guns, or outlawing hunting, but they are the loud ones, who garner the attention.<br />
<br />
To my mind, not all gun laws are bad, and certain types of guns can(and arguably should) be banned.  Note that I did not say all guns, or even most.  Gun education should be a part of schooling, same as drivers ed is.  Teach children proper safeguards when having guns are important.  And do not worry about some fringe element in the UN, simply put, the US is not  going to ban gun ownership based on what they want.</div></div><hr />

but allow them to purchase a gun at 12 years of age...<br />

<br />
This is actually only partly true.  We also want a gun to protect us from people wielding an axe, people with knives, and people with sharp sticks.  The point of having a weapon to defend yourself is to be able to defend yourself, from anyone. <br />
<br />
Your wife is home with your six month old baby while you're out of town on a business trip.  A 230 lb. drugged up coke head breaks into your house and decides that ripping the place off and maybe raping your wife and killing your child might be fun.  Would you want your wife to have a gun available or would you prefer she be completely at this man's mercy?  An extreme situation, admittedly, but these situations do happen.  They're in the newspaper all the time.  Perhaps not exactly as described but close enough.<br />
<br />
Also while much of Europe seems to be okay with the idea, we in the U.S. are not comfortable with our government being the only organization/entity able to get guns.  We don't completely trust our government to behave in our best interests and we feel that if we give away our right to weapons we give away our ability to resist if the worst should ever happen.   Government is by it's nature a delicate institution and is open to influence, subversion, and abuse.  We trust it just so far.<br />
<br />
Also understand that in our Declaration of Independence the ground work was laid for the replacement of government under extreme circumstances, here is some of the relevant text if you're interested.<br />
<br />
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. --That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security. <br />
<br />
It is the firm and steadfast belief of many Americans that to give up their right to own weapons removes their power to &quot;to alter or to abolish&quot; the government.  Now don't misunderstand me, I am in no way advocating the overthrow of our American government.  I am merely stating that the documents on which we base our entire system of government establish the clear right to do so if there comes a time where the government is overly &quot;destructive&quot; of our &quot;unalienable Rights&quot;.<br />
<br />
How does one &quot;alter or abolish&quot; a government when only the government has the guns?  I'd argue that many of the Iraqi people weren't completely happy with their form of government, but since only the government really had the guns....</div></div><hr />

<br />
Our system of government is set up such that if we do not like what the government is doing, we ourselves can change it, simply by voting.  To be perfectly honest, I don't care how many guns you have, if you try a coup here, you will  fail.  It might sound good and all that you have guns to protect yourself from the government, but in this day and age, it is simply not true.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u74"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p74">I'd argue that that whole policy is based around the extremely unlikely idea that all your armed forces would suddenly go into robot mode and NOT disobey orders that they can see are totally against the cultural freedoms you cherish. Such a scenario is only ever likely to occur in the movies - the only way a government can push people to accept such limitations is if said government manages to convince the MAJORITY of it's people that their idea's are correct, if the majority has guns and outnumbers the minority what exactly have you gained? Apart from massive loss of life when the opposing civilians start 'arguing'.<br />
<br />
A heck of a lot of people in Iraq had guns. Average Joe tribesman and his friends all had guns, every faction had guns. Didn't stop a dictator with enough popular support gaining and holding power or are you suggesting every citizen should have access to his own personal Main Battle Tank to 'even the odds' against the establishment? :p <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">This is a carbon copy of every gun control debate on the net.  And as such is boring as hell.  <br />
<br />
Really I wouldn't expect anyone outside the US to understand how a lot of Americans feel about firearms and freedom.  You don't have our history or culture to make you understand why it is so important to us.  The US gained their independence, or at least started that way, using guns that were owned by the men that carried them.  The founding fathers considered it very important that in the future US government, the people of the country should have the power to keep the government from turning tyranical.  So important in fact, that they included it in the most important document in US history....the Bill of Rights.  Power first through voting and the system of checks and balances, secondly through the fact that the citizenry was armed and able to defend themselves should the government become oppressive.  It is a damn good system, and it spawned the most successful country in history.  Anything that erodes the ideals of the founders of that system is a bad thing in my book.<br />
<br />
A tyranical government taking over the US is, like you said, unlikely to happen with the American system, and if it did happen, it's even less likely that a successful resistance could be mounted against the full force of the US government assuming it had the armed forces on it's side.  It's a matter of principle though.  When I have never used my guns for anything wrong, I am going to question the motives of anyone that tells me that they need to be taken away from me for my own safety.<br />
<br />
The other reason, is another cherished word in America.  &quot;Liberty&quot;.  &quot;Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of happiness&quot;...the American dream.  I don't *need* a gun.  In fact, you could make an argument that I wasted my money on the ones I have.  I never shoot them.  I have never been mugged, robbed, or molested in any way by anyone, and it's not something I worry about.  Hell, I don't even lock my door half the time.  But I could probably get by without knives, baseball bats, cars capable of breaking the speed limit, books with &quot;dangerous&quot; thought in them, you name it.  The fact is, I live in a free country, and I want all of that stuff, and would not want to live in a country where my government tells me what I can and cannot do for the sake of safety.  A speed limit is ok, but making a law that no car be capable of exceeding 65 miles an hour is not.  It's a subtle distinction but an important one in my mind.  I have no problem with a law against shooting people, but there is no reason to take MY guns away, becuase I don't shoot people with them.<br />
<br />
Those willing to give up a little liberty for a little security deserve neither security nor liberty.<br />

Its like your responding without even taking the time to think what it is you are actually saying.  Some of the points I am going to make here have already been said but they are worth repeating.  <br />
<br />
to quote Haass<br />
Everyone I know that owns a firearm has it under lock and key. Of course, these are responsible individials, and they are also not responsible for violent crimes involving their weapons<br />
I suspect you know less than 0.00001% of handgun owners in the United States.   Just becuase your friends and family are responsible doesnt mean that everyone is.  Whilst I agree they themselves may be responsible in their normal state of mind, what about the burglar that comes into a house where the owner isn't as responsible, finds a gun, then gets disturbed and decides his/her best chance out is to start shooting people.<br />
<br />
Then theres the son/daughter who has bad grades, in a state of depression and decides to go get daddies gun and pop themselves.  Yes I know if someone wants to kill themselves or others taking guns away isnt really going to prevent this.  There are plenty of other ways to do this.  But and again I will bring this up.  Guns are specifically designed to shoot people, its that simple. <br />
<br />
Haass's next comment<br />
Limited range? My dad has taken down deer a quarter mile away with a .306. Maybe a handgun has a limited effective range, but high powered rifles designed for sport do not.<br />
<br />
<br />
Totally agree with you, however there is 1 major difference between a high powered hunting rifle and a .35 calibre semi automatic.  I have yet to meet the man who can hide a hunting rifle in his waistband.<br />
<br />
Haass's next post<br />
and I am sorry this has all been you so far, dont worry it wont last :), i;m just taking them in order<br />
I gotta take issue with this. Firearms on our police officers are for a reason. I've heard it stated many times &quot;Ya, lets see how big of a man you are if you put down that gun&quot; and it's true. Most of the police officers currently employed in my area wouldn't know what to do with a 6'6&quot; 250 lb guy who used to work as a bouncer at a club if they didn't have something above and beyond what that guy has (namely his fists and a lot of brute force).<br />
<br />
Maybe those kinds of people aren't around much in england, but in the US, there are some BIG dudes, and if they don't want to be put under arrest, they are perfectly capable of preventing that from happening. I've routinely seen video clips of people requiring 5 or 6 officers to pin them down and get cuffs on them.<br />
<br />
Police officers having firearms isn't a bad thing..it's for their safety.<br />
<br />
<br />
This HAS to be a joke right?<br />
You dont for one second believe that the US has the monopoly of big men with violent tendancies?  Yes there are times when extra force using a gun MAY be required, but there are PLENTY of none leathal means of taking down suspects.  When a situation occurs that does require extreme force it should only be done by people specially trained for it, SWAT teams for example.  If the area isn't big enough to warrent SWAT then 1-2 specially trained officers.  Do you not think it is possible that your police forces have become to dependant on guns?   Maybe you could outfit them all with Uzi's that way if there are multiple perps they could take care of them all in one go?  Yes this is, of course obsurd, but no more obsurd than an American Police Officer HAS to have a gun to protect him/herself from that 6'6 goon round the corner.<br />
<br />
Moving on to Glatius<br />
Your wife is home with your six month old baby while you're out of town on a business trip.

Would you want your wife to have a gun available or would you prefer she be completely at this man's mercy?<br />
<br />
Well as your all resposible with your guns i'm sure your wife will have the time to get the keys to the lockable storage the gun is in, load the gun and fire?  Then again, maybe its in your bedside cabinet?  Maybe your wife fumbles the gun and the coke head picks it up and decides to shoot the wife and kids and then for good measure takes his nice new gun and does the same to any witnessess that are around.  After which, he tucks the gun in his belt and then goes and sells the gun for a couple grammes more coke?<br />

<br />
Of course not.  We are not allowed to recklessly discharge firearms either.  We are allowed to both drive AND drink alchohol, but not do them both at the same time.  The gun in my gun cabinet is not endangering anyone, and taking it away from me would not make anyone safer.  Reckless behavior is illegal because it endangers other people.  The capablilty to behave recklessly is not.  It's already illegal to shoot your pistol in the air in a populated area.  Banning guns altogether would be like banning alchohol, because someone might drive drunk afterward.  It's a big difference.</div></div><hr />

Maybe she had the gun in the bedside table during the night and locks it up during the day.  Maybe the gun vault has the combination preset so all she has to do is set one number and it's open.  However she and her husband want to deal with the situation in a reasonable manner is their business.  Many crooks have been stopped by a homeowner with a gun.  It happens.  Guns aren't required to be locked up at all times you know, just when you're not going to be there to monitor them.<br />

In today's world, absolutely.  You vote and hopefully enough Americans agree with your opinion that the government is changed accordingly.  This is the way the system is designed after all.  However, the fact is that if for some reason a President should decide that the system isn't one he wants to abide by, there is still the opportunity for the people, in a majority, to revolt if need be.  Certainly this would the course of last resort, but take away all the guns and there wouldn't be a course of last resort, there would just be a lot of helpless sheep.  Much like Iraq was.  <br />

<br />
If the criminal is going to come with a gun, banning them won't make that unlikely.  Most guns that are used by criminals are stolen or illegal.  You might make the case that fewer stolen guns would be available if fewer people had guns, you can also make the case that fewer stolen guns would be available if those people with guns were more responsible.  The illegal flow of guns would continue regardless.  The Glok is a very popular on the illegal market and it comes from Russia.<br />
<br />

<br />
It all depends.  Sometimes running is the better course of action, sometimes it isn't.  Unless you're there, how are you to know for sure?  I'd still rather there be a firearm available, if she wanted it and knew how to use it.  It is after all, her life in the balance, who are we to say she shouldn't have it, if she wants it?<br />
<br />
Guns do not stop crimes, not do banning of guns, but guns do increase the lethality and when the lethality goes up so does the events with deadly endings.<br />
<br />
Yes, I'll concede you're probably right that guns do increase the lethality and that not everyone who owns a gun uses them responsibly.  So all the people who do use them responsibly should be penalized because some don't?  We actually have more people die in car accidents each year than we do from gunshot wounds.  Should we ban cars as a result?  How about smoking, we probably have more people die from smoking each year than we do from gun shot wounds, should we completely outlaw cigarettes as a result?  How about alcohol, more people die in alcohol related accidents or from alcohol related illnesses than from gunshot wounds, shall we outlaw alcohol too?  You can either be responsible or not.  If you're not, there are laws in place to deal with that irresponsibility.  If you are, then your rights should not be infringed on just because you &quot;could&quot; be irresponsible.</div></div><hr />

I live in Wisconson in the USA,  its a very very nice place to live with rolling hills, fresh air and lots of timber.  Come deer hunting season schools are closed an entire week for the event.  Hunting is a huge source of income for our area and is probably comperable to the tour de france or the world cup in their respective countries.  People get excited about it and enjoy their time in the field with family and firends.<br />
<br />
I would imagine if you didn't kill any deer for 10 years that they would destroy themselves with some time of communicable disease from overcrowding.  I know that it would be hard to travel at night if the heard wasn't thined yearly.  <br />

I feel alot more comfortable with them shooting deer than seting up boobietraps (sp?) for them.  The suckers are fast too so clubing them like baby seals is tricky.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u83"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p83">What does hunting with a rifle have to do with small arms for self protection btw Brutall? No serious anti-poster here is arguing the stupidity of a total ban on firearms for 'professional' use but to most people in stable societies outside the USA the idea of casual ownership of a firearm seems just slightly insane. Guns make killing trivially easy, how can it not lead to more fatalities?<br />
<br />
Frankly the arguement that you need a firearm to prevent the government from placing a speed restriction on your car is the most laughable thing I've seen in this thread so far. Just in case you were wondering btw, I don't own a gun and the national speed limits in the UK are HIGHER than in the US. Doesn't seem like that arguement has much bearing really does it?<br />
<br />
Guns have no place in the governance of a country, if they gain such importance then that country is pretty fucked up. And please don't get me started on America's heavy handed approach and total removal from reality on the Northern Ireland issue and how American's pumped money into Sinn Fein which was then used to purchase weapons (from America) so that the minority terror groups could go around killing innocent civilians (the majority of their targets) and the Army personnel put in to keep the peace. There were plenty of 'bad situations' throughout the troubles in Ireland that were brought about because soldiers in a hostile environment made the wrong call, unfortunately there was no way anyone could keep the peace against civilian factions armed with firearms without arming those responsible for keeping a lid on things....see where I'm heading here?<br />
<br />
I have to say that as with Zukobim &amp; Krag i have yet to see a truely valid arguement beyond some pretty wacked out 'examples' to suggest that owning your own efficiently lethal weapon enhances your lifestyle by any great stretch. Bad things will always happen, there's no getting around it, for every case that the gun 'helps' I have to wonder how many more situations end tragically.<br />
<br />
Quoting Ben franklin is all very well, it makes a great soundbite, but you do realise that your liberties are already very heavily curtailed by Governance in order to keep order don't you? It's neccessary to provide laws and taboo's to hold a society out of anarchy. Are you sure that the level of freedoms you champion, not just firearms but in all aspects of your society might not be contributory to the extremeness of some incidents we hear about on the news? is it a circular arguement in that make it seem neccessary to your viewpoint that you must have a lethal form of self protection to keep you and your own safe?<br />
<br />
Now isn't that a can of worms :p <br />
<br />
But as you say it's your country, the blinkers are well and truely on and if you're ready to live with the consequences then who am I to stop you? Who knows, perhaps you're even right.

Which is really the point.  We, in a significant enough majority to make it possible, believe that access to firearms is a fundamental right as a citzen.  We have the right to protect ourselves, period.  If only the government and the criminals have the guns, then we are ripe for being abused by both.  Our country, our rules.</div></div><hr />

The fact that i can't stuff a gun in someones face to give my views extra credence doesn't seem to have crippled the democratic process in my country for the last couple of centuries any more than having that option has helped in the US. The UN has no more ability to force policy on you than your government has to do so to you.<br />
<br />
/nod Fair enough.  And I would say the U.N. has less ability to force policy on us than our own government.  We don't elect the leadership of the U.N., at least not directly as citzens.  We haven't agreed to give them power over us as individuals.  Therefore, regardless of what they may or may not pass as resolutions, it will be our government that decides whether or not we as a nation abide by them.  And we as citzens who decide whether or not the government made the correct decision.<br />
<br />
And I would refer you to a something supposedly said by Adolf Hitler, or perhaps it was Stalin.  It goes something like this.  When an intellectual argues with you, show him your gun and he'll shut up.  Now, if the intellectual also has a gun, this is less likely to be true, at least imo.<br />
<br />
Oh, and here in the U.S.  I can't stuff a gun in someones face to give my views extra credence because that would be assault, which is against the law and I'm a law abiding citzen, in the main.</div></div><hr />

Both Hitler and Stalin ruthlessly oppressed those people that disagreed with them via force yep, but only because the majority, for various societal and economic reasons supported them enough that they had a firm base of power. Guns will always be available if people wish to resist, they don't need to have them in the drawer at home. Even if you do have a collection of small arms it'll not matter a snowballs chance in hell vs. the might of a Countries armed forces. Once the idealogical battle is lost and the families of those soldiers (and by extension the soldiers themselves) are on side you, the champion of your ideals are nothing but a small road bump. Most people, even if they have high principles, aren't particularly interested in suicide.<br />
<br />
I'm trying to think of any single instance relative to the modern world of a country succumbing to a dictatorship due to a small number of people having weapons whilst the populace does not. Dictators can only expect to rise to power in countries that have slipped so far into disorder that proper gun control is no longer effective anyway. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u91"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p91">Maybe you're right Valeris, but what would have happened if every Jew taken to the concentration camps had a gun at home and had used it when they came for them?  Things might not have gone so smoothly.  One of the things that allows the idealogical battle to not be lost in the U.S. is the fact that we insist on having small meaningless rights like the right to bare arms (which we actually don't consider small or meaningless).  We believe that indeed having a gun in the drawer at home (or more correctly in a gun safe) does make it less likely that the forces of evil will gain enough of a base of power to ruthlessly oppress us.  In fact the concept is one of the key points our system of government is built on.  We have the power to alter or abolish the government, through utilizing the system as it is designed, or by extreme measures if the system is subverted or corrupted.<br />

<br />
The serving US Police officer who shared this information with me was Pro-right to bear arms, so i'm sure he would have pointed out such a skewing factor. He told me about the extensive training and specialised holsters etc that the police employ to minimise the possibility of loosing control of their weapon. The point is off at a slight tangent i admit but I felt it served to illustrate that having firearms to hand in a situation ups the lethality of said situation. If an officer is killed by his own weapon then it's fairly clear that it was actually the very action of bringing his personal sidearm into a stressful situation that precipitated his death, now extend that logic to every gun holding household in america,  also consider that everytime a police officer answers a domestic disturbance s/he must be aware of the possibility of facing a live firearm and that human beings placed in stressful situations tend to react, not think clearly about their actions..... <br />

Might want to read a little bit more history about the War of Independance before talking this kind of smack, instead of watching 'The patriot' and calling that in depth research. as with most things in history there were far more shades of grey (on both sides) than the 'dumber and dumber' popular mythology suggests.<br />
<br />
For instance, most american citizens including many of the leading lights wouldn't have sought seperation from the British Empire if their concerns had been more sympathetically met, a combination of mistakes, fate, French interest in weakening their opponents and an overly proud and arrogant King all combined to create a conflict that neither side truely sought.<br />
<br />
You might also be interested to know that the basic bones of the declaration of independance were largely penned by a radical activist (forgotten name sorry) with an axe to grind, heh.<br />
<br />
Lets also not mention the agreements made between the British Crown and the various Native american nations which kept American entrepreneurs from exploiting the natural resources of area's that were claimed in treaty by those Native americans, treaties that could be 'renegotiated' after the break...<br />

The human condition is far from simple Valeris, but I do know this very simple truth.  Many men are attracted to power.  And the more power they gain the more power they want.  Without a series of checks and balances government is fairly easily swayed to the cause of dictators.  We know this to be true because we see it happen time and time again in country after country.  Both our countries have been lucky that we haven't suffered these probablems in the recent past, but no one knows what the future may bring.  So, you can make every arguement you want that guns aren't part of the answer, but that won't sway me or people like me.  I have yet to see a dictator take power where the majority of people resisted him with force.  <br />

Now, I realise that sometimes the Brits take some pretty serious heat over colonialism.  At the time they did what most nations of power were doing, very few were completely innocent of it.  The fact is they were just a little better at than most.  But all the same, Americans take a certain amount of pride in having broken away from England, pretty much on our own terms.  Granted, the situation wasn't as much a military victory for us as it was the British having other things to deal with and not being able to continue to commit the resources.  Still, why begrudge us a little national pride?  Does it really it harm you in some way that we are proud that we took our destiny into our own hands as a nation and didn't do too shabby, all things considered?  I would expect a bit more magnanimity from a people who once ruled an Empire on which the sun never set.</div></div><hr />

I have no problem with National pride, I have a problem with blind pride which leads people to make gross generalisations, there's lots of things I admire about the US, there's also several things I'm less admiring of -  the same holds true for my feelings about my own country (although right atm I'm finding more negatives than positives about the UK and it's government, sadly).<br />

Oh don't get me wrong, I don't doubt the loyalty of our army, not in the least.  However, military leaders can be swayed, subverted, bribed, and so on.  The army could end up divided, confused, the loyal units moved over seas and so forth.  I grant you that if the entire U.S. Army, Navy, Marine Corp., and Air Force turned against the American people then undoubtedly the fire power that could be brought to bare would overwhelm mere civilians fighting a conventional war.  However, guerrillas have managed to fight on when conventional means were useless.   I doubt that it will ever come to that, by any stretch of the imagination, but part of the reason it won't is because we won't allow them to take our guns to begin with.<br />
<br />
I have more faith in the American Armed Forces than I have in their leadership, military or civilian.  This does not mean I wish to be defenseless and forced to solely rely upon their good will, thank you very much.<br />

However, the fact is that if for some reason a President should decide that the system isn't one he wants to abide by, there is still the opportunity for the people, in a majority, to revolt if need be.

You all say that if there is a need for you to rise up against your government, then having guns allows you to do this.  I would point out that this (yes it is exagerated in parts,) seems to me to be as good a reason as any.  (copied from my servers web forum)<br />

You need a gun to protect yourself against someone attacking you with a gun but he wouldnt have access to a gun if he didnt have a chance greater than 90 percent forcing himself into a empty house to get a gun and find one.<br />

They are also countries where a lot of people are robbed in their homes.<br />
<br />
My house was robbed around 5 times in all.<br />
<br />
My family never ever had a gun. And we never ever suffered great loss.<br />
<br />
<br />
When someone breaks into a house, it's to rob you. Unless they have somethine personal against you or your culture.<br />
<br />
We've never had any problems because our robbers know we dont have guns.<br />
Knowing that their victims arent dangerous, they wont be dangerous themselves.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now if you're in america... you know everyone owns a gun, or almost...<br />
so if youre going to rob someone, youre not only freaked out because it's legal that they shoot you on their property, and youre thus risking your life....<br />
but you also brought a gun, because it's your best means of defense.<br />
<br />
So now... instead of having a robber with a knife calmly robbing you.<br />
You got a robber with a gun panicing....<br />
<br />
<br />
And a part from that...<br />
how many crimes have you had in america, where some freak comes into your house, and rapes/kills/does horrible things to a family?<br />

how many times in america were there problems with the right to own a gun? (students bringing legally purchased guns to school, father shooting their daughter, kids playing with their daddy's gun etc.. )<br />

<br />
This entire thread was a troll.  The UN hasn't said anything like that (other than I imagine an individual stating an opinion).  Basically this was thrown up out of context and the links I see here are hardly damnable evidence of a &quot;global conspiracy to take away world firearms&quot;.<br />
<br />
1) I think the UN is a mixed bag.   Its main purpose is to serve as the &quot;oil&quot; to keep countries talking with each other.  It really isn't designed very well to create/enforce international law...strange how this function seems to gain SO much attention.  The UN does great work in facilitating communication, coordinating aide and being the  last resort for many humanitarian needs.  <br />
<br />
2) As for guns:  I've lived in TX, LA and New York.  I kinda see guns, whether you like them or not, to be part of the fabric of american society (it is not a part of other world societies so it makes it hard to understand to non-americans).  <br />
<br />
The only part of guns I have a particular problem with are:<br />
<br />
- them getting in the hands of children<br />
- individuals getting access to &quot;military grade&quot; weapons and munitions that can potentially put them on an even footing with police &amp; military personnel.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately legistlation to add gun locks, make guns safer (training/safety education) etc all seem to get blocked by the noise of black/white arguments about them.<br />
<br />
p.s. I don't own a gun but as a kid had some pretty extensive training in rifles/handguns from boy scouts.  My wife's family owns a ton of them (Arkansan's) but we don't have one in the house.</div></div><hr />

What, if any training or proof of profiencency is required before being able to purchase a gun?  <br />

This is bullshit no matter how many times you say it.  Just because you have never been around firearms doesn't mean that they aren't used for many legitimate things.  Where I grew up, everybody (seriously everybody) had a gun.  Most had multiple guns.  My uncle's father worked in law enforcement and he had over 50 in his personal collection.  This is a rural area where people leave their keys in their cars year round.  The house I grew up in had no lock on the front door.  Crime was nonexistant in this area.  In my lifetime, I cannot think of a single violent crime that happened with in 20 miles of my house.  Clearly there is no direct correlation between gun ownership and crime.  These guns are NOT for protection.  A few of them are used for hunting, most are not.  3 of my 4 guns have never been used for hunting, and they were not bought for that purpose.  A large number of people enjoy shooting for pleasure.  Hell it's an olympic sport.  There are something like 250,000,000 privately owned firearms in the US.  Something like 350,000 gun related crimes were commited in the US last year, that means about 0.14% of guns in the US were used in crimes.  999 out of 1000 guns aren't used in crimes, but that is there only use?  Please.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u118"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p118">krag it isnt as easy to get a gun as you think they do back round checks, also a credit check to see if your employeed or in bad shap (they do this because they want to prevent suicides or people from going postal) even after that they make you wait 3 days as a cool off period and you still have to register this wepoan and bullet purchases are tracked, thats why most crimes are done with illegal guns.<br />
<br />
as for shooting i dont do it for fun, i do it for 2 reasons<br />
<br />
1. hunting, and i dont do it for fun damn it! deer meat costs ALOT at the market, a pound of beef could be 10$ and a pound of deer can be 30 or 40$ because they dont corral them and ranch them like cattle, if i go hunting myself i can fill up my freezer with enough meat to keep it stocked for a year, and deer meat is very verstile as long as you know how to cook it correctly(red and black)<br />
<br />
2. if someone comes to my house, with the intent to end my life for 50 dollors at the most, i want that scum to have a very large chance of failure its also stupid for people to say its better for everyone to have steak knifes and baseball bats because we can out run people and use these innate defensive hand to hand combat skills we are born with. HAVE YOU SEEN AMERICANS? MOER THAN 50% of us are over weight! we cant out run someone who is hardend from a bad life of fense hopping and store robbing. Not all of us can get judo/iquido/jujitsu~ lessons, must i re-itterate most of us are large or extremely weakend from our none industral jobs? i dont see a network admin or a school teacher fighting off some SoB with a knife,baseball bat or a bed leg, with a gun tho things are eather a land slid in your favor or a 50/50 chance you shoot or they shoot, not only that but i am sure they are expecting you to NOT be there or be asleep so i have even more of a chance to shoot first, not all shots are iminent death eather, that why the target shooters that people call red necks or hicks practice, id rather shoot a guy in the shoulder or the leg where they have a high chance of living than shoot someone in the chest because its a big target, despite what you may think i hope i NEVER EVER have to kill someone because it goes agesnt my morals and my religion, but in both cases self defense is ok<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u119"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p119">First Krag, just so you know, I am closer to being on your side than Glatius in this issue.  I live in Michigan(home of the Michigan Militia, and yes, they are just as nutty a bunch of people as you think), and most people I know have guns and NRA bumper stickers.  I myself do not, and all guns could be banned and I would not shed a tear.  But I do not advocate such a plan, not would I ever back it.<br />
<br />
But to disagree on one point.  Bush is still president because, by the laws of the land, he is the rightfull president.  A really really really bad president, but still the rightfull one.  The trouble with the 'guns to protect yourself againt evil government' argument is not that we have not overthrown a bad president, but that, in fact, common people armed with common weapons could not overthrow an evil government if that government had the army on its side.  And if the government did not have the army, it could not last.<br />
<br />
The argument about guns as protection from the government is an excuse, simply put.  The world is nothing like it was 220 years ago, when a militia, armed with hunting rifles could effectivly help defend the country(note that is the real idea behind the second ammendment, not overthrowing our own government, but being able to defend our government...read the whole ammendment). <br />
<br />
Gun nuts are scarey people.  'You can have my gun when you pry it from my dead fingers' is a scarey statement, suggesting that people value their guns more than their lives.  Thankfully, people that extreme are rare(tho vocal).  Most of us accept that, with more guns, comes more violence, and that it is part of the cost of living in what we feel is the best country to live in.<br />
<br />
Edit:  we need a spell checker.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u120"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p120">I'll say it again, cars are designed to provide a form of transportation from A to B. Guns are designed to seriously injure or kill human beings. (notice the difference?)<br />
<br />
Guns are designed to either kill game (hunting), to defend your person, or for personal enjoyment (target shooting and so forth).  If defending your person requires leathal force, then it's the look out of the person threatening your well being.  I think it was Thomas Jefferson who said that your right to wave your arms around ends where my nose begins.<br />
<br />
I've heard your arguement that guns owned by the common person are much more likely to be stolen and thereby fall into the hands of criminals.  True enough.  But again, just because some people are going to be irresponsible doesn't mean you should take rights away from everyone.  We have the right to own a car, some people use cars irresponsibly.  Some people have cars stolen and used in crimes.  Some people have cars stolen and fatal accidents result.  Yet no one argues that cars should be banned.  They argue that guns should be because they believe guns are inherantly dangerous, designed to kill.  Yes, that is right, they are, and if they weren't they wouldn't be a weapon would they?  You are in fact using their purpose as an arguement they shouldn't be allowed.  You're saying that because I can own a gun to protect myself and because I might be irresponsible enough to allow that gun to be stolen without taking reasonable precautions, this justifies that NO ONE outside of the government should own a gun.  I say you're wrong.  And I believe I speak for a lot of Americans.  The irresponsibility of the few does not justify the restricting of everyone barrnig extreme circumstances.  Punish the irresponble ones if need be.  Leave the responsible law abiding citzens the hell alone.  It gets old constantly having further and further restrictions placed on you because some idiot somewhere did something stupid.<br />
<br />
What, if any training or proof of profiencency is required before being able to purchase a gun? <br />
<br />
My understanding it that firearms training requirements vary from state to state.  Some states require an extensive course in firearms safety.  Some states have little or no requirements.  This is something left up to the individual state to decide.  And trying to change it would step on traditional states rights, something not to be taken lightly.<br />
<br />
And consider this.  How much training or proof of proficiency is required for a woman to have a child?  Is not bringing up a new life just as important as owning a gun?  Yet no requirements are in place other than she be fertile and can find a sperm donor.  <br />
<br />
How extensive are the background checks that go into a person before being allowed to buy a gun? What proof is required that they have the means to store a gun safely?<br />
<br />
The background checks are becoming more extensive.  Many states have a waiting period after you've purchased a gun before you can take possession of it.  There are lots of variables involved.  As far as proof being required that they have the means to store the gun safely, I'm not sure there any.  But then again it's up to the individual to take responsibility, and to be penalized if they don't.<br />
<br />
What would it take to require this so called uprising of the common populace?<br />
<br />
In essence, it would take the complete loss of faith in the system.  Regardless of what we as individuals think of the current leadership or their actions, they've not done anything overtly illegal by our measure.  And so the system is functioning as intended.  In a couple of years we have another election and we determine if we have continuing faith in the current leadership or a change is in order.   Every country must have occassions where their leadership is less than ideal.  If the population rose up in revolt every time this was true, there would be non-stop revolution.  Revolt is the course of last resort when all else has failed.</div></div><hr />

No, guns in the hands of common people would not even matter in that situation.  1 tank &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 100 handguns.  Nice try, but no.<br />
<br />
if i fire a round thru my roof they will bolt right out of my house <br />

Or panic and unload there gun in the direction they heard you shoot from.  Hope you got no kids in the house.<br />

<br />
I respectfully disagree.  To you it's an excuse.  To me it's a fact.  During times of civil disturance world history has shown again and again that the army is often divided, lead by traitors, distracted in other areas, or just unable to act.  You may be comfortable counting on the army to intervene if the unthinkable should come to pass.  I am not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u124"><b>kragrock</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p124">See, there we go, you starting to make actual points that have validity.  I now know that the background checks are quite extensive (something I didnt know before.)<br />
<br />
Hunting is a perfectly legitimate excuse to own a hunting rifle, I don't and never have disagreed with that fact.  Admittedly I am no expert but I dont see how using a handgun is practical for hunting.<br />
<br />
Using guns for target practice is also not really a big deal.  Hell in my own youth I admit to firing a air rifle (complete with warped barrel) down at the fairground.  Personally my own opinion is if you want to do target practice it should be carried out in a controlled enviroment.<br />
<br />
350,000 gun related incidents in the US last year?<br />
How many of those involved guns bought from the local wal-mart?  remember 1 is 1 to many.<br />
<br />
How many accidents were there in the home that resulted in serious injury or death, that was a direct result of a gun bought from a store?  again 1 is 1 to many.<br />
<br />
Yes all those objects can be used for different things, but if you cannot see the difference between using a car for a nice drive in the country and a gun, then there, in my mind anyway, is something wrong there.<br />
<br />
Gerick would you really pull a gun on someone who is stealing 50 dollars with the intention of using it?<br />
<br />
I to dont see a school teacher fighting off a SoB with a knife or a baseball bat or a knife and they dont have the option to pull out a gun, but we seem to do OK.<br />
<br />
In the world as it stands today, there are legitimate reasons for owning and posessing a gun.  Personally I am glad I live in a country where the posession of guns is extremely restricted.  I feel the negatives of gun ownership outweigh the benefits.<br />
<br />
On a final note, I wasn't bashing Bush it could have been President Joe Bloggs for all I care.  The point was you were using the right to own guns in case the need ever came to overthrow the government was ever needed.  I was asking the question, what would need to happen for you to exercise that right.  Dont answer it as a nation, answer it from a personal point of view.  What would it take for you personally to rise up and use force to overthrow the government?</div></div><hr />

2. guns are needed to keep government in check. 2nd amendemnt <br />
3. self defense<br />
 <br />

1. General public should not have easy acces to lethal weapons such as hand guns. Everyone agrees that gun clubs/hunting clubs are in legal bounds.<br />

I probably missed some.<br />
<br />
Here are the stats on gun related deaths which are not effected by population of the country. It was current in 1994. You are surpassing Ireland 2x fold...

Which have these countries have internal problems (such as Northern Ireland which would give a higher figure than would normally be the case?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u130"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p130">bunnie id like to point out that alot of people on this thread have been made fun of for having mutipule guns, that is why they have them tho, so they can be all over the house, also in the USA if you have children it is THE LAW that you must have a child lock on it, as for guns being illegal and that would mean less all around there is a black market for them, like the song about jimmy cracking corn(making moon shine and selling it during a probishon), people wont care. as for me, i dont have kids and because of that i dont mind living in a crappy area because im living for myself, if i get kids i will move, sell the guns and get a monitering system, to be honest i am very skilled with daggers and short sword IRL and i can get by with them just fine (which are legal in the usa and have less checks on the buyers) i can also use a bow with custom arrow heads that contain nicotine, 1 drop of which can kill anyone in pure form(also another deadly force wepoan that isnt well moniterd and its alot more silent TWANG :))<br />
<br />
also anyone that wants to bring kids using daddys gun to kill their friend is a piss poor excuse for banning guns, they were breaking the law by not putting child locks on them, the children shouldnt even know dad has a gun because its temptation at a dangerous age, a few retards shouldnt ruin something for the rest of us, beer can be enjoyed in moderation, it can also kill people in a verity of ways</div></div><hr />

id like you to read up on the the patriot act, who is being contracted by the government, id also like you to check who financed bush, the list will be almost the same DBT is also making money by selling DNA to the FBI files so that they can use it on anyone they please in effect allowing them to build profiles on innocent cilvilans and DBT doesnt tell people they are doing this when the submit DNA, they tell them it is in case someone in their family or themself gets killed and needs to be indetified, and it is alot better than showing your corpse to your family, but they are not obligated to tell you the government is paying for your records and DNA because of the patriot act and that bush is allowing the CEO of DBT to do it (poin dexter is the guys name getting kick backs and contracts from bush)</div></div><hr />

'You can have my gun when you pry it from my dead fingers' is a scarey statement, suggesting that people value their guns more than their lives. Thankfully, people that extreme are rare(tho vocal). Most of us accept that, with more guns, comes more violence, and that it is part of the cost of living in what we feel is the best country to live in. <br />
<br />
I don't value my guns more than my life.  If you happened to get ahold of them before I do, i wont stop you from taking them from me. <br />
<br />
What I do value however, is my right to own them.  You try to take that from me, and hello volley of lead.<br />
<br />
Extremists are a lot more common than you may think.  Once, a few hundred years ago there were a few people labeled as extremists.  Their names are Samuel Adams, George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, and the list goes on.<br />
<br />
Our nation was founded by extremists, our nation is run by extremists, extremists get noticed, they are the ones that change things, they are the ones that enact things.  Without them, we would be speaking french.  Yes, french, because without those extremists, France would have won the French and Indian war, and England would have been out of the picture far sooner than they were.<br />
<br />
To call me an Extremist, and to put me down because I value the rights my country gives me above all else is nearsighted at best.  I have a lot of love for the USA and what it stands for (not the president, or his policy, i mean the constitution, and our inherant rights as citizens), as do many many people who live here.  Our military then, at the least can be called extreme, as every member therein has pledged to die in defence of this right, a charge that I was called extreme for, because i would lay my life down to protect it.<br />

Yes, you want my guns, you will have to pry them from my cold dead fingers, because I'm not giving them up without a fight.</div></div><hr />

Redhenna, I generally enjoy your posts, but you are 100% wrong here.  Even the gun control organizations don't try to make this argument.  If you read the federalist papers, it is very clear what the founders of the constitution intended, even if the actual wording of the amendment is awkward in today's language.  Feel free to go read up at http://memory.loc.gov/const/fed/fedpapers.html, but don't make this argument because you are definitely wrong.  The 'militia' is needed to protect the &quot;free state&quot; NOT the government of the free state.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u137"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p137">Extremists are a lot more common than you may think <br />
<br />
I suggest you look up the definition of the word extreme.  Common != extreme.<br />
<br />
Their names are Samuel Adams, George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, and the list goes on. <br />
<br />
Actually, they were simply the leaders of a common movement.  If they did not enjoy a sense of common support, they would have had little chance to do what they did.  Note that I do not deny the greatness of what they did, only the labeling of them as extremists.<br />
<br />
To call me an Extremist, and to put me down because I value the rights my country gives me above all else is nearsighted at best <br />
<br />
I put down the concept that a piece of forged metal(or however they make guns) is more important than life.  My life is far more important than any material possesion.<br />
<br />
Our military then, at the least can be called extreme, as every member therein has pledged to die in defence of this right, a charge that I was called extreme for, because i would lay my life down to protect it. <br />
<br />
The people serving in our military pledge to die in defense of the country itself, and the constitution, not a chunk of metal.  This is a huge difference.<br />
<br />
because I'm not giving them up without a fight. <br />
<br />
Note that I have also reffer to the people who would attemp to ban all guns as extremists.  Very very few people are out to take your gun away.  I am not one of them.  People on both extremes of the gun issue get all loud, and drown out the voices of reason.</div></div><hr />

You don't really have to reasearch it.  There have been supreme court decisions that have done it before and their conclusion is that it was most definitely intended as a right of individuals to own guns.  The &quot;well-regulated&quot; part is what allows certain restrictions to be placed on those rights.  Like I said, you won't even hear the gun control people making this argument...if you do they are saying that it is outdated, not questioning the intent of the amendment.  The link doesn't work because my comma at the end got into it.  This one should.<br />

EDIT:  I have to retract my sentence about the supreme court.  The supreme court has actually been relatively ambiguous on this topic and generally refused to take cases on it.  I believe the current supreme court has a 2nd ammendment case on the table right now though.</div></div><hr />

In times of insurrection, or invasion, it would be natural and proper that the militia of a neighboring State should be marched into another, to resist a common enemy, or to guard the republic against the violence of faction or sedition. This was frequently the case, in respect to the first object, in the course of the late war; and this mutual succor is, indeed, a principal end of our political association. If the power of affording it be placed under the direction of the Union, there will be no danger of a supine and listless inattention to the dangers of a neighbor, till its near approach had superadded the incitements of selfpreservation to the too feeble impulses of duty and sympathy.  <br />
<br />
This is the concluding paragraph in the section 'Concerning the Militia'.  It still sounds to me that it is talking about a state run army.</div></div><hr />

 ... This appointee will therefore carefully and diligently didscharge their sworn duties to support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; to bear true faith and allegiance to the same; to obey the orders of the President of the United States and the orders of the officers appointed over them; according to regulation and the Uniform Code of Military Justice.<br />
<br />
show me where, in the oath of admittance, where it says we protect the country ... your statement is exactly backwards.  Next time you try to tell someone what he said in an oath he took, make sure you know what the fuck your spewing out of your asshole.<br />
<br />
Furthermore ... the leaders of the colonial army were extremists, they did not have popular vote.  1/3, yes not a majority, of the colonists agreed with the petitioners for independance.  So no, the majority was not there, in which case, they were in fact extremists.<br />
<br />
Get a clue on history please, before you again spout non-sensical dribble from whatever oriface you see fit.<br />
<br />
Oh, i never said i valued a chunk of metal ... read again, even the exact quote you pulled from my post ... no where do I say i value the chunk of forged metal sitting on my desk, or at my side, which yeah, i dont keep locked up, I use my weapons for my career (Law Enforcement, EX-US Military).  I clearly stated, i value my RIGHT to keep and bear them.  <br />
<br />
And as such, so does everyone that calls him/herself a patriot, or a soldier.  <br />
<br />
I will not throw down my life for a &quot;Chunk of metal&quot;, however, i will throw down my life in defence of the right to own that said chunk of metal.<br />

Try reading before you pick things apart, as a sentance fragment only relays half of what is imposed.  Without the full effect of a body of words, you only get peices of what you need to put it all together to get a complete thought.<br />

I have found passages in the papers in the past that made it pretty clear to me that the founders were discussing individual rights and not state's rights.

But continually, what i have also said, is fighting and dying for the right to own a gun, and all other rights our constitution garners, is not.<br />

<br />
In general a constitutional amendment is very difficult to pass.  You need 2/3 majority in both houses in congress, and then it has to be approved by a vote in 3/4 of the state legislatures.  I believe there are special rules regarding the bill of rights, but I'm not sure on that.<br />
<br />
Finally, a few quotes, and now I have to go get some work done hehe.<br />
<br />
&quot;Firearms stand next in importance to the Constitution itself. They are the American people's liberty teeth and keystone under independence. From the hour the Pilgrims landed, to the present day, events occurences and tendencies prove that to ensure peace, security and happiness, the rifle and pistol are equally indispenable. The very atmosphere of firearms everywhere restrains evil interference - they deserve a place of honor with all that's good.&quot; -- George Washington, Commanding General of the Continental Army, Father of Our Country and First President of the United States in a speech to Congress, January 7, 1790 <br />
<br />
&quot;The strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a last resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in Government.&quot; -- Thomas Jefferson, Author of The Declaration of Independence, and Third President of the United States <br />
<br />
&quot;Laws that forbid the carrying of arms ... disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes. Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants, they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man.&quot; -- Thomas Jefferson <br />
<br />
&quot;The highest number to which a standing army can be carried in any country does not exceed one hundredth part of the souls, or one twenty-fifth part of the number able to bear arms. This portion would not yield, in the United States, an army of more than twenty-five or thirty thousand men. To these would be opposed a militia amounting to near half a million citizens with arms in their hands, officered by men chosen from among themselves, fighting for their common liberties and united and conducted by governments possessing their affections and confidence. It may well be doubted whether a militia thus circumstanced could ever be conquered by such a proportion of regular troops. Besides the advantage of being armed, it forms a barrier against the enterprises of ambition, more insurmountable than any which a simple government of any form can admit of. The governments of Europe are afraid to trust the people with arms. If they did, the people would surely shake off the yoke of tyranny, as America did. Let us not insult the free and gallant citizens of America with the suspicion that they would be less able to defend the rights of which they would be in actual possession than the debased subjects of arbitrary power would be to rescue theirs from the hands of their oppressors. -- James Madison, principal author of the Constitution, principal writer of The Federalist Papers, Fourth President of the United States, Mainstream Revolutionary and Militant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u155"><b>Smakz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p155">Smackz, a followup to your answer if I may. Is it correct that each state decides its own laws and when it comes to laws that fall under the constitution they basically look at the wording and then interprete that as they see it? <br />
<br />
One thing that has always puzzled me, The United States is governed by one government. Why do each state have there own set of laws outside of the ones that cover the entire nation?<br />
<br />
Finally, what would happen if it did come to the point where having these laws in place did become detrimental to the nation?<br />
 <br />
<br />
As this is an intelligent response, and one asked to further understand how we work, i shall answer it.<br />
<br />
Krag, yes, Each state decides its own laws, ordinances and statues.  Our country is so large, that sometimes its needed to have lower bodies of government to enforce said laws specific to a region, which is why we have states and counties. <br />
<br />
The laws states make are not set outside the ones the country makes.  All laws, either on a state or federal level, all answer to the constitution.  If a law is made that is deemed Unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of the United States, that law is removed from the law books in whatever state or county it derived from.<br />
<br />
Again, because of our 3 bodies of government, the system of checks and balances we put on ourselves, from the formation of the country, no law that is passed will become a detriment on socitey.  If a law is unconstitutional, it is no longer a law.  All law in the USA, at any level, all goes back to the constitution.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u162"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p162">The Constitution, being the defining document upon which the United States government derives all power, is by definition that which has brought the government into being.  Without it, the United States government would have no authority.  By defending the Constitution you are point in fact agreeing to defend the government.  However the Constitution also clearly lays out that it is the duty and responsibility of the government to defend the people.  So by defending the Constitution you defend the government.  The governement is obligated as per the Constitution to protect the people.  So, by defending one you are defending the other, if everything is working as intended.  When it's not working as intended is when we as a nation should be most concerned.<br />
<br />
With regards to the question about the American system of government and how we have one government but different states deal with certain issues differently from each other.  When the founding farthers put together the Constitution they were very concerned that the federal government might take on powers that they felt more properly belonged to the individual states.  They wanted to have individuality state to state.  Maryland didn't want to have to follow exactly the same laws as New York, nor New England the same laws as Virginia. And so they built a frame work were only those things specifically indicated as being the responsibility of the federal government would be under it's control.  Anything else would be up to the individual states to decide.  The federal government in point of fact is not supposed to interfer with the internal running of the states.  They are seperate governments with seperate powers and responsibilities.  And while there are some areas of overlap, it is far from total.<br />
<br />
In fact the 10th Amendment to the Bill of Rights says the following:<br />
<br />
 The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constituion, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people.<br />
<br />
Red, I believe that your interpretation the 2nd Amendment of the Bill of Rights is incorrect.  Given that the people writing the document had just a few years previously fought a fairly long running war with the British.  Given that hostilities between the Colonies and Native Americans were still an ongoing concern.  Given that the wilderness surrounding the colonies still held abundent wild life, some of which was dangerous.  Given that these men feared the loss of individual rights to a great degree and went to great pains to make sure that the federal government had as many checks and balances placed on it as possible and even went so far as to say that those powers not specifically granted to the federal government should remain with the states or the people makes it impossible for me to believe that they intended that the federal government or even the individual states would take all responsibility for &quot;A well regulated militia&quot; and therefore disarming the entire populace was even conceivable to them.<br />
<br />
If in fact the founding fathers had intended that to be the case the admendment should have read more like this:<br />
<br />
A well regulated army, being necesary to the security of a free state, the right of the state to arm the army shall not be infringed.<br />
<br />
Rather than what it is:<br />
<br />
A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.<br />
<br />
But this would be ridiculous.  Why would a government need to specifically protect their own right to create a standing army and arm it?  Why would the phrase &quot;right of the people&quot; be included?  Notice that they very carefully indicate that either the individual states or &quot;the people&quot; shall retain powers not given to the federal government.  They're very specific there in dividing federal government, states, and the people.  Yet here you're inclined to believe that they were sloppy and in fact didn't mean &quot;the people&quot; but rather either the federal government or the individual states.  <br />
<br />
The &quot;well order militia&quot; is the reasoning why &quot;the right of the people&quot; won't be infringed.  To paraphrase it they're saying, the right of the people to bear arms won't be infringed.  Why?  Because a well ordered militia is necessary to the security of any free state.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u171"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p171">One does not have to belong to a well regulated militia in order to have the right to keep and bear arms. The militia clause is merely one, and not the only, rationale for preserving the right. The Founders were expressing a preference for a militia over a standing army. Even if today's well regulated militia were the National Guard, the Second Amendment still protects an individual right to keep and bear arms.  <br />
<br />
Got this quote from this (http://www.guncite.com/gc2ndpur.html)  website, which is very much pro gun.  I included the whole paragraph to show what he is explaining, but the part that caught my eye is this:<br />
<br />
The Founders were expressing a preference for a militia over a standing army <br />
<br />
This ties in very well with a number of other quotes I have seen, expressing dislike of standing armies, therefore a militia to be necessary for defending the state.<br />
<br />
Also, in my reading, found many references to the strange wording of the second amendment.  It is the only amendment with a preamble, and the exact meaning of the preamble is debated.  The courts have ruled repeatedly that because of the preamble, restrictions on types of guns that can be owned or manufactured are perfectly legal.  The key ruling of that nature is one from the 1920's, where the court upheld a law banning sawed off shotguns.<br />
<br />
I hate when my curiosity get's up and I have to find out about something.  Wasted a perfectly good night with all this reading.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u172"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p172">Very interesting reading.  Of course those rulings made by the courts of individual states would only be persuasive in other states and not mandatory (meaning that other courts may consider them but aren't bound to follow them as precedents).  It makes an arguement that the states can excercise some controls over the right to bear arms, but not completely ban them.  And we don't seem to have a clear Supreme Court decision indicating that they're right or they're wrong in the belief that they can excercise these controls.  Which means they can until it's ruled otherwise.<br />
<br />
At best it makes a case that the federal government is not able to infringe on the right to bare arms but the states, individually, may have some right to do so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u173"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p173">2 Supreme court Decisions.  The first from 1939(the sawed off shotgun case), the court upheld The National Firearms Act, stating:<br />
<br />
In the absence of any evidence tending to show that possession or use of a &quot;shotgun having a barrel of less than eighteen inches in length&quot; at this time has some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia, we cannot say that the Second Amendment guarantees the right to keep and bear such an instrument.  Certainly it is not within judicial notice that this weapon is any part of the ordinary military equipment or that its use could contribute to the common defense.  Aymette v. State, 2 Humphreys (Tenn.) 154, 158. <br />
<br />
The second case, from 1980 involved a felon in possesion of a firearm.  The court upheld that in the government could make laws making firearms illegal to felons.<br />
<br />
Mostly tho the supreme court has been very quiet on the second amendment, generally refusing to hear cases, including a number of cases involving states placing limits on weapon ownership.  Currently the NRA does not challenge gun laws based on the second amendment, but uses other amendments to overturn laws  as an example, using the 10th amendment as the basis for it's succesfull attempt at overturnng the original Brady Bill in 1997.<br />

With that said tho, I do not now, nor plan to support any law outlawing guns.  Simply put, it would be unconstitutional to ban guns.  I live in Michigan, where dear season is something of a state event, and do understand the necessity of thining the herd(3 cars totaled in my lifetime from hitting dear).  The negative aspect of guns are part of the price I pay for living in the US, and I pay that price unhesatantly(sp?).

If guns were banned who will turn in thier guns and who keep them.  The law abidding citzens will turn into thier guns while the criminals will keep them to prey upon us like wolves prey upon sheep.  I beleive in gun control but that doesn't help the situation when their are dirty low life scum out there that doesn't follow the rules and sell them without backround checks that we have to worry about.

Its not the weapons that kill, acording the the gun statement.<br />

My guess is that the many countries has realized that you can rarely stop the one puller the trigger/pushing the button.<br />
The countries have realized that removing the availability of the weapons will lower the lethality of the situation, if (or when) it will come.<br />

Its true that guns do not kill, but you got no way to stop the person that pulls the trigger, unless you insert a &quot;big brother&quot; that follows everyone around in everything they do at all times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u178"><b>kragrock</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p178">I think after this discussion, this is the view I am going to settle on.  Banning guns in America is something that just isn't going to happen.  Even if 99% of the population wanted it, it is just something that cannot be done.  A document like the Constitution isnt just something you can pick and choose from, it is either all valid or none of it is valid.<br />
<br />
However I do believe after all I have heard, that the current laws governing the purchase of guns is insufficent.   When the constitution was written there is no way the founding fathers could have envisaged what the US and the world would be like in this day and age.  <br />
<br />
Ideas that would keep the constitution legitimate and help to curb the flow of handguns.<br />
<br />
To get a licence to own a Handgun in the first place, one must pass a comprehensive background check, they must also have attended a course which covers the safe use of a firearm and covering information such as the secure storage of a handgun.<br />
<br />
Purchase of a handgun will only be allowed upon proof of access to secure storage for the gun.<br />
<br />
Restrictions on the number of guns you can own, limited to a minimum of 1 handgun and 2 rifles or in a household with more than 1 adult of voting age 1 handgun and 1 rifle per adult.<br />
<br />
Facilities available for the hand-in of old guns should a person wish to buy a new one.<br />
<br />
Any and all guns in a household over this number should be made safe, (firing pins removed or something)<br />
<br />
just some ideas, by no means a definitive list</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u179"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p179">i agree i dont think our gun laws are harsh enough, hell our military has had 3 people in this war that have turned granaids on their own brothren, what does that tell you? <br />
<br />
As for WMD zub, saddam would not be allowed a pocket knife if he was in the USA, he killed people (felony, most of the time its life in prison or death) he has commited hate crimes of race and religion. thing is evil people that have commited crimes are barred from owning guns, as for stopping the spread it depends, 3rd world nations shouldnt have those kinds of wepoans, the USA and GB are allowed to have nuclear wepoans and items, why?? oh why??? because these countrys are well enough off that they dont have to raid their nabors for money and supplys, i feel sorry for any country that does but if you allow people in desprate situations something that can be used to hold the world ransom someone will try to seze control of the wepoans<br />
<br />
*edit* i do not think the number of guns matters as per owners, if i faced the screening process and passed then i am entitled to my wepoans, i like having a gun in every room, so no matter where i am i can defend myself, i may be a bit paranoid but i will be alive, metal lock boxes work because there is only 1 key, and it is always with me, and when i sleep it is in my pillow case</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u180"><b>Zukobim AB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p180">Before Saddam became president of Iraq, you could do sanity and background check on him all you wanted and not come up with anything.<br />
Saddam is not stupid or insane and he would be smart enough to control his extreme views.<br />
Saddam would get a weapon permit without much trouble.<br />
<br />
I am living in Denmark with a pretty strict weapon law.<br />
Here pretty much only non-automatic hunting rifles are allowed and only after background checks and passing a safety course.<br />
Weapons have to be storaged behind double locks, where the main part of the weapon has to be behind atleast one different lock than one  the vitale part of the gun is storaged behind.<br />
The vitale part is decided by the authorities, like the bolt, firing pin or so, which makes sure its the same part across the country.<br />
<br />
We do have gun crimes here, but we do not have the big cases where someone empties a clip from a machinegun in a moment of insanity.<br />
Criminals can still get hold of guns, but its a thing that are reserved for the &quot;upper&quot; class of the criminals, which are mainly into organized crime.<br />
If you are not deep into organized crime, then you are pretty safe from those few weapons that are floating around in those circles.<br />
<br />
We still have bank robbers that use guns, but its mainly toy guns that are used and occasionally a saved over shotgun.<br />
The toy guns seems to do the job pretty well for the robbers, but with the difffernce that its alot less lethal to the staff in the bank.<br />
The saved over shotgun are usually available from the breakins where both the gun and the vitale part is robbed, but a saved over shotgun is not easily concilled (sp?), so its harder to use and you can not shot everyone down with ease.<br />
<br />
If you allow normal law-abiding people to own guns, then you also indirectly allow criminals to own guns.<br />
The argument about defending yourself ight sound valid to you, but what are you in fact defending yourself against??<br />
You are defending yourself against your neighbor's gun either wielded by himself in a moment of insanity or by some criminal that stole it, which would not be necessary if the guns were not allowed in the first place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u181"><b>Mahhj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p181">It's really a matter of one thing, debate the little points and numbers all you want, they'll hardly make a difference. Brutul touched on this in many of his posts about American sentiments.<br />
<br />
It's a matter of principles... principles like freedom and property ownership. You can show us numbers and figures and explain to us practical applications and projected results, but that's not important. <br />
<br />
I can see how it'd be important to a more socialist country where 'right' is one-in-the-same with 'greater good'. I would imagine numbers and statistics are very important when debating out what brings about the best for the most. <br />
<br />
There's such a huge culture difference, that it's hard to explain. <br />
<br />
In America, there remains a fundamental feeling that living isn't living without freedom. The right to own property is tied at the hip with freedom. It's freedom in motion. There's more to it then thinking freely. You have to be able to act with freedom. <br />
<br />
The ownership of firearms is very dear to me because of how extreme the issue is. In many ways, it is a vanguard to the right to ownership of so many other things... that we can keep the fruit of our labors. If we can keep this one right, one that seems silly and outdated to many, then maybe we can hold on to everything else that comes after it.<br />
<br />
Freedom was so important to early Americans that it was fought and died for... not delayed and haggled for with governments for hundreds of years. There's an importance there that has yet to completely leave the American culture. <br />
<br />
It's our tradition and heritage. I don't think the UN will be very succesful trying to have us adopt anything of that sort on our shores because of that reason.<br />

<br />
The background check is already done for handguns.  Really the only thing it can check though is whether you have ever committed a felony and whether you have been in a mental institution or have been shown to be mentally unstable.  This is very easy to do and can done instantly through a computer database.  I don't see a problem with that.  The safety course is fine too as long as it's inexpensive and available on demand.<br />
<br />
Purchase of a handgun will only be allowed upon proof of access to secure storage for the gun.<br />
<br />
Pretty tough to legislate safe storage.  You can sell every gun with a trigger lock, but you can't make people use them.  A gun safe doesn't make things safer if the gun is in the nightstand.  In the end, firearm safety is in the hands of the gun owner.  You can sue them for negligence if the gun is left out and a child gets it and hurts themselves, but there's not really any way to legislate gun safety.<br />

America is a nation based on religion, it's principles are closely tied to your Bible...<br />
yet, the Bible says you shall not kill your neihbour... yet almost everyone owns a gun.<br />
<br />
<br />
You have to note that times change too...<br />
it's retarded not to change laws because your &quot;Fathers&quot; had set them at the beginning....<br />
laws need to evolve with the society.<br />
Arms were easy come easy go at the time where cowboys were still chasing indians....<br />
now you got cities with 2millions people concentrated in them...<br />
do you want guns all over the place?<br />
<br />
Reminds me of a law in England... up until very recently, all taxis were FORCED to have a stack of hay in the trunk.<br />
Why?<br />
Because the law was made back when taxis were pulled by horses.... now its a car... yet they didnt change the law, and made complete fools out of themselves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u184"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p184">A document like the Constitution isnt just something you can pick and choose from, it is either all valid or none of it is valid.<br />
<br />
Exactly.  While the Supreme court will from time to time waffle a bit on an interpretation of a passage of the Constitution, they never ever say that any law may violate it.  As the cornerstone of our entire system of government as soon as you say one part doesn't have to be enforced you bring the whole document under question.  And we as a nation have a lot of faith in our Constitution.  Overall it's worked very well for us, guns and all.<br />
<br />
However I do believe after all I have heard, that the current laws governing the purchase of guns is insufficent. When the constitution was written there is no way the founding fathers could have envisaged what the US and the world would be like in this day and age.<br />
<br />
This is the crux of the gun control advocates arguement.  And because it rings true, that the founding fathers could not have possibly envisioned what the future would be like, it does hold some sway.  Gun control laws have been passed, in a limited form.  Assault rifles have be defined and banned, at least in some states, except in certain limited cases.  Back ground checks are more universally required and performed.  And I expect that as time goes on more education regarding firearms will be required.  <br />
<br />
Yet when all is said and done I'm convinced that history shows that the founding fathers firmly believed that arming the people was the basis of freedom.  And that once you disarm the people you make the loss of freedom that much more likely to occur.  They didn't believe a standing army was inherantly safe or necessarily trustworthy.     <br />
<br />
And so we find ourselves in a quandry.  Do we as a nation retain our right to protect ourselves, our loved ones, our community, and our nation as we see fit?  Or do we sacrafice this right, and our belief in the Constitution that grants it, in the name of superficial security while increasing our vulnerability to the forces of tyranny?  It is not a valid arguement to claim that no one will ever attempt to be a tyrant because history has shown that almost without exception someone always attempts at some time to subvert governmental power from it's rightful course for their benefit.<br />
<br />
Me, I'm going with the Constitution and the right to bear arms.  And I'm hoping that the enough of the rest of the country will agree that the alternative never comes to pass.  Yes I know that the people of other nations may not understand this.  They may even think it's a bit insane or idiotic.  But in the end how we run our nation is our insanity to choose.  And if being idiotic works for us, then I suggest you tend to your own gardens and leave ours to us.</div></div><hr />

Nothing major in it just a couple of minor points, when a thought occured to me.  Now this doesnt happen very often, so when it does I like to chase it up straight away :)<br />
<br />
Anyway, Most here defending the right to own guns are using the 2nd Ammendment and the fact that if the right to own a gun is removed, it is removing a right you as Americans are given under the Constitution.<br />
<br />
Here is the relevent sentence.<br />
<br />
 A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed. <br />
<br />
We all know it well now.  Now to this little thought bugging me, havent you already had part of your rights removed with regard to this sentence?  As has already been pointed out, the wording here is all important.<br />
<br />
The words that I seem to see a problem with is 'bear arms'<br />
<br />
The Merriam- Websters dictionary lists 'bear arms as meaning<br />
<br />
- bear arms 1 : to CARRYor possess arms 2 : to serve as a soldier<br />
Now forgive me if I am wrong but do you still have the right to carry arms?   I dont know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u187"><b>Adzar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p187">Yes we do</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;If a bullet costs $1000 there would be no gun crime&quot;<br />
<br />
You all have still preserved the right to own a gun. Just make the cost of that ownership so fucking expansive, that people choose not to. Hell you doing same thing with Tobaco industry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u189"><b>kragrock</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p189">You can walk down the street with a gun at your side? because that is certainly what that is saying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u190"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p190">The right to carry weapons varies greatly from state to state.  In California you are not allowed to carry a loaded weapon in public.  I would hate to see what would happen if you got on a bus or a train with even an unloaded shotgun or rifle though.  I'm sure it would inspire panic in a lot of the people around here hehe.  In many states you are allowed to carry guns, but almost all require a permit to carry a concealed weapon.  This has actually been legalized in a lot of states in the last few years.<br />
<br />
And Chris Rock is a funny dude.  But I don't think it would be fair to make guns only available to rich people by setting excessive prices on them.  If they did, people would just get them on the black market, like a lot of people do with cigarettes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u191"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p191">no what I am saying is its still legal to buy a gun in accordance with 2nd amendment. Just make it inacesable to general public by increasing the price of ownership by a LOT. Can be done through some license fee too that you have to pay each year.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u192"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p192">Read the document mostly Brutul, it sounds good from a pro- arms point of view but at the end of the day owning your own firearm doesn't prevent dictators, doesn't instill respect for the justice system, doesn't make a government fear to disrespect their electorate, what exactly does it do? Sane people will never use the gun to get their way in anything but fantastically messed up situations, and in the mean time you make it easier to murder, easier to obtain a lethal weapon to commit crime, easier for potential fanatics to arm themselves in order to attack the freedoms you espouse - Because the nutballs are the ones with the will to kill not the average sane citizen.<br />
<br />
If the situation ever became bad enough that armed resistance became neccessary then people would be able to find the means to resist, history has shown us that.  In every case where subversion of national will via arms(as opposed to a shooting war or political changeover) has occurred in the modern world the examples have all taken place in countries where firearms are readily available anyway. Somalia wasn't made a better place by the civilian's having access to firearms, Iraqi's of all stripes had access to firearms, how exactly did it help them protect their freedom?<br />
<br />
When you come right down to it, the easier it is to own a lethal weapon the more you encourage the 'Rule of the knife'. Even the police forces, due to the fact that 'the great equaliser' also equalises things for the criminal, are often left with a situation in which the end is only reached with the loss of human life.<br />
<br />
Sorry, I still don't see that as a worthy price to protect me from movie script levels of governmental subversion - if a government is subversive it'll go about things in a much less obvious fashion than you can cleanly 'fight', heck it'll most likely be a long slippery slope from the appearance of 'the best of intentions' to a nightmare - The USSR is a good enough example of that - Stalin had the support of the people prior to disarming them, he maintained general public support even during his worst excesses. Only a mass groundswell of people's will's and opinions can create political change/safeguard freedoms, firearms don't make that happen they don't even particularly facilitate it. Whenever you kill a man you make an enemy of that man's family, doesn't matter how 'just' you think your cause is. <br />
<br />
I can see no scenario in which civilian militia's will 'save' a country from itself, and lets be honest, human nature being what it is you can be damned sure, no matter how pure their intentions the leaders of those militia's will end up just as ambitious/power hungry as the politicians they seek to displace....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u193"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p193">Heh, i can probably distill most of that last post into one or two sentances - if potential exists that would promote a political change or other power struggle, then that change is just as likely to occur wether you're swimming in guns or not. Only the way the struggle will be prosecuted will change not the struggle itself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u194"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p194">We'll have to agree to disagree Valeris.  The will to fight is more important than the means to fight.  But the will to fight is something which needs to be nurtured.  People have to be willing to stand up for what they feel is right. They have to be willing to oppose the criminals and the tyrants.  They have to feel that they have power.  An unarmed man will inherantly feel less powerful.  His will to fight will be reduced because he feels he doesn't have the means, if push comes to shove.   It is much easier to shove a gun in the face of a man who disagrees with you and tell him to shut up if he has no gun himself.  It is as much psychological as anything.  If a society is told that they're not to be trusted to protect themselves.  That only the government can be trusted to protect them.  That they must make themselves powerless to resist the will of the government because only it knows what is best for society, where does this lead?  It leads into the government working to benefit government and the people that it's supposed to benefit being used like cattle.  <br />
<br />
Many of us in the U.S. have no desire to be cattle, thank you very much.  And being able to own weapons gives us a sense of reasurrance that when all is said and done we can at least attempt to do something if it ever gets to that point.<br />
<br />
You disagree.  Nothing I can say is going to change your mind.  I realize this.  But I've also made up my mind, based on the knowledge I've gathered and my own researches.  You believe you're right.  I believe I am.  Luckily we both live in countries that happen to support our individual views so we can both continue to live in societies that fit our beliefs.<br />
<br />
But I'll tell you this, man to man.  It will be a cold day in hell when the U.N. successfully passes a resolution removing small arms here in the United States from the hands of the common man and kids themselves it won't be resisted.  They'd have to be fools.  And they'd be wrong.  Those people who believe in the right bear arms believe so with a great deal of passion.  And yes, I would expect them to fight.  Because it is one of the cornerstones of our system of government and by passing it they're basically saying our Constitution is irrelevant.  And if the Constitution is irrelevant then the government has no authority to dictate anything.  All they'll have is naked power.  Naked power can sometimes be enough, but not if everyone resists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u195"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p195">I think you underestimate the power of an armed populace.  Civilians outnumber soldiers in the US probably 400 to one.  Putting a country that is 3000 miles across under martial law would be completely impossible, even if the military was 10 times the size it is now, and all of those millions of people having access to firearms would make it a whole lot harder.  The British Army was considered the best in the world at the time, but they lost to a bunch of colonists with hunting rifles and (eventually) a little help from the French.  We learned in Vietnam and many other places that a small number of armed guerilla fighters with the support of the local civilians can give even the best army fits, hell look at Iraq.  Saddam loyalists are a tiny faction, but UN troops are dying there almost daily.  Imagine if all of the civilians were against the occupying UN forces...it would be a nightmare, and Iraq is smaller than some states in the US.<br />
<br />
In the unlikely scenario of the US people vs the US army, I don't think it would be as one-sided as you think.  <br />

This is true, which is why Americans refuse to allow their government to go even a little ways down that slope.  No one thinks that the US government wants to suddenly turn into a tyranical dictatorship, but partially that's because we won't let them.  <br />

You could've fooled me what with all the anti-Bush retoric :p<br />
<br />
Back in the days of the american revolution a military grade rifle wasn't greatly more efficient than a hunting rifle, the only heavy ordinance were Cannon which were hard to manuvere and bring to effectiveness outside of a pitched battle. there were no tanks, machineguns, grenadelaunchers, jet aircraft, flamethrowers etc etc etc. <br />
<br />
And do you really think the majority of the people would all leap forward with patriotic fervour in their hearts to oppose this evil government? We're back in movie territory here. The strength of peoples political ideals win or loose these fights before a shot is fired.</div></div><hr />

Many times, I agree.  But political ideals have to be backed by something.  Political ideals without the will to fight and die to protect them are in the end just words.  I forget who the quote is from but it goes, the price of freedom is eternal vigilance.  I seriously doubt he meant, so you can spout political rhetoric at the evil doers!  <br />
<br />
We believe that the will to fight is best supported by the means to fight.  After all a man shot in the head dies regardless of whether or not he's carrying the best equipment in the world today.  You can't convince us that because our weapons are less effective in relation to those of the military that justifies our being denied our weapons.  It doesn't work that way.  And in the end, if it did come to it, I would expect at least a portion of the military to be in armed revolt as well.  They're Americans too, after all.  But even if there they weren't that wouldn't stop those of us with the belief and the faith from trying, even if we failed.<br />

I don't dispute that final line at all, i dispute the idea that you have to be armed before hand -  given that you can and do expect Army &amp; National Guard units to be on your side they'd quickly outfit you with more appropriate weaponry. Side arms for self defense are relatively meaningless if things really got so bad that armed insurrection was truely neccessary. <br />
<br />
I still see the arguement about having a weapon in case it ever got that freaky as silly, it's not like  you couldn't get hold of a weapon if it ever came time that you really truthfully had to fight, people are very good at killing each other, they always find a way :p</div></div><hr />

No, not really.  And I'll tell you why.  Those people with their own handguns would first of all be familiar with guns to begin with, they'd feel confident in their ability to use them, even if the handgun wasn't the weapon they ended up using.  Secondly they would already have the mentality necessary to resist, they'd be psychologically prepared to use that weapon.  You know the best way to make a house cat a coward? De-claw them.  You know the best way to make a man a coward?  Take away his weapons and tell him he's not competent enough to have them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u204"><b>Jat5</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p204">I hate coming to a good thread late<br />
<br />
Just a few things to add. First of all, to those who enjoy statistics, a quote from INTERPOL:<br />
 It should be pointed out that the Interpol General Secretariat merely reproduces the information sent to it by the NCBs. The Information given is not therefore processed, but is classified according to category of offence. The data gathered in these sets of statistics is not intended to be used as a basis for comparisons between different countries since the statistics cannot take account of the differences which exist between definitions of punishable acts in different national laws, or the diversity of statistical methods, or the changes which may occur during the reference period and affect the data collected.<br />
Police statistics reflect reported crimes, but this only represents a fraction of the real level. Furthermore, the volume of crime not reported to the police actually depends, to a certain extent, on the action of the police and can vary with time, as well as from country to country. Consequently, the data published in the current set of statistics should be interpreted with caution.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://www.interpol.int/Public/Statistics/ICS/Default.asp<br />
<br />
Of particular note to those comparing violent crime between the United States and the United Kingdom is how homicide is recorded.<br />
 The murder rates of the U.S. and U.K. are also affected by differences in the way each counts homicides. The FBI asks police to list every homicide as murder, even if the case isnt subsequently prosecuted or proceeds on a lesser charge, making the U.S. numbers as high as possible. By contrast, the English police &quot;massage down&quot; the homicide statistics, tracking each case through the courts and removing it if it is reduced to a lesser charge or determined to be an accident or self-defense, making the English numbers as low as possible.<br />
<br />
http://www.reason.com/0211/fe.jm.gun.shtml<br />
<br />
English statistics are also reduced if the primary suspect dies before the case can be brought to trial or is found to be mentally unstable and unable to be tried. Yes, I did read that from some pdf file from house of commons library, but I have lost the reference link so take it for what its worth.<br />
<br />
Aha, here it is..<br />
Manslaughter in England and Wales is the unlawful killing of someone without any<br />
malice being expressed or implied. The Homicide Act 1957 introduced the concept of<br />
conviction for manslaughter while accepting diminished responsibility, so-called 'section<br />
2' manslaughter. This defence has largely come to replace findings of insanity. This<br />
introduces a discontinuity to the statistics, because it is impossible to tell which<br />
convictions for manslaughter after this date might previously have resulted in a<br />
conviction for murder or manslaughter, or a finding of insanity.<br />
Also:<br />
In Scotland, unlike England and Wales, a single offence is counted for each act of<br />
homicide, regardless of the number of victims or offenders. The Dunblane tragedy, then,<br />
was recorded as one act of homicide, whereas in England it would have resulted in the<br />
recording of 17 offences, and Lockerbie in 1988 similarly as one, rather than 270.<br />
<br />
From: RESEARCH PAPER 99/56 Homicide Statistics, 27 May 1999. House of Commons Library.<br />
<br />
So, pointing to crime statistics and saying that one country is more dangerous than another means exactly Jack Schitt unless all the information is collected under the same standards. Obviously thats not the case.<br />
There is also lots of interesting reading on gun crimes from the land of the toughest gun control laws in the world.<br />

Yeah, I know Ive already stated comparing statistics means Jack, but its still interesting reading if you follow just the interpreted trends.<br />
I myself live in a legal concealed carry state, personally, I have absolutely no worries about my neighbor freaking out and gunning me down in a moment of insanity. The United States, besides being big believers in personal liberty, has also been sold on the theory of deterrence.<br />
<br />
Would you be more likely to barge into someones home if you knew it was illegal for them to shoot you?<br />
Would you think twice about it if you could come face to face with grandma and her double barrel 12 gauge?<br />
How about mugging someone who might let you have the wallet or the .44 hollowpoint?<br />

Call me a reckless cowboy if you wish, I still get a certain satisfaction knowing the criminal element must consider whether the possible gains outweigh the risks involved in breaking the law.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u209"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p209">No, not really. And I'll tell you why. Those people with their own handguns would first of all be familiar with guns to begin with, they'd feel confident in their ability to use them, even if the handgun wasn't the weapon they ended up using. Secondly they would already have the mentality necessary to resist, they'd be psychologically prepared to use that weapon. You know the best way to make a house cat a coward? De-claw them. You know the best way to make a man a coward? Take away his weapons and tell him he's not competent enough to have them.<br />
<br />
Interesting point but then i never said you shouldn't have training with firearms if you felt it neccessary to preserve liberty... there's all sorts of grades of preparedness heh  :)<br />
<br />
jat5 I agree if trends continue things might become worse and armed police etc might be needed, that's a failure of society, justice and various factors, not neccessarily my lack of right to bear arms in public. As I sit here in the UK I know that the idea of someone running amok with a handgun or burglarising me with a gun are still fairly slight, can you say the same? Also, all those American studies point to a reduction in crime rates since 1991 or whatever year... you've had the right to bear arms since the time your country was formed, if the numbers are correct then obviously you're doing something correct somewhere but is it directly related to personal protection? Serious question. Has anything changed to do with possession of a firearm in that time period that would lead to this reduction? And if it has was it increased controls?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u210"><b>Drunken Mick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p210">We've always had the right to bear arms, however, with state laws having separate interpretations as allowed under the 2nd amendment.  Being, specifically, the right to carry a concealed weapon.  Not going to take the time to pull up which states do and do not allow the carrying permits.  Suffice to say in states where you DO have the ability to carry, crime goes down... more and more states over the last 10 or so years have legalized carrying a weapon.  That would correlate to a decrease in violent crime, no?<br />
<br />
I've lived in two states where permits where allowed.  One of them I had one in.  I had my pistol with me everywhere I went, except as prohibited.  Places where alcohol are served and banks.  Never had to pull it.  Didn't want to have to.  But sure as shit, criminals in those states gotta think twice before they assault anyone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To my knowledge nothing has changed of significance in that time period having to with the right to bear arms that would explain the reduction in crime.  But then again, to my knowledge nothing has changed of significance in that time period having to do with gun control either.  Which would tend to point to the fact that crime is based on factors that are at least somewhat independent of the right to bear arm.  Since you can't say there is a direct corolation between our right to bear arms and the increase or decrease of violent crime, on what basis would you restrict it?  Guns are just as available as ever if not more so and yet crime goes down.  I won't claim that having the guns is the cause, if you won't try and claim that not having the guns reduces crime.  Crime seems to go up or down based on many factors, and allowing the populace to go armed is not, apparently, one of the most significant factors if it's a factor at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u212"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p212">There have only been a couple significant changes in gun laws that I can think of in the last 10 years.  On a national level, a 3-day waiting period and background check was implemented for handgun purchases.  This didn't change anything about who could purchase a gun, it just decreased the chances that guns would be bought (through legal channels anyway) by convicted felons or former mental patients.  As far as I know, what the background check looks for is prior felonies, dishonorable discharge from the military, and mental problems.  It also made everyone wait 3 days after purchasing a handgun before they could actually take possession of it.<br />
<br />
On a state level, various things have been changed from state to state.  States like California and Massachusetts have increased gun control, banning certain &quot;assault rifles&quot; (scary-looking military style semiautos that are functionally the same as a lot of hunting rifles), and &quot;junk guns&quot; cheap, crappy handguns that can't meet certain quality tests (like proving that they will not go off when dropped from 3 feet in the air, or firing X times without jamming etc.).  On the other side, many states have legalized or loosened restrictions on concealed weapon permits.  <br />
<br />
I don't think any of these things could explain a 10 year downtrend in crime.  Crime is obviously effected by a large number of factors, and saying more guns = more crime is simplistic at best.  I haven't looked at Australia's crime numbers in a while, but at least initially, they had a similar uptrend in crime to the UK after banning most guns.  <br />
<br />
As you can tell from my posts, crime statistics aren't my primary concern in the gun control issue.  If I was 100% sure banning guns would cut the crime rate, I would still be against it.  However, I have yet to see an example of a country implementing strict gun control and then seeing a decrease in crime.  In the most recent exmples, Australia and the UK, crime has increased since private firearm ownership was banned or restricted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u213"><b>Jat5</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p213">Valeris, you have some interesting questions, Ill do my best to answer them.<br />
First of all, yes, I can honestly say I feel my risk of being involved in a gun related crime are slight, despite what the statistics are used to show. That is, of course, my own personal evaluation of my risks, which does not mean everyone will feel the same.<br />
<br />
<br />
Secondly, as Drunken Mick has pointed out, ownership and possession of firearms are treated differently from state to state. ( Local laws and regulations can even vary widely from county to county within the same state.)<br />
<br />
As an example, it has never been illegal for me to own a legally obtained and licensed firearm, (which means I could own anything but a fully automatic assault rife specifically banned throughout the united states. Etc.) however, the transport and use of those firearms are tightly controlled in some areas.<br />
In, hmm, Illinois I believe, the only way for me to legally transport a legally owned handgun from my home to the shooting range was for the unloaded weapon to be holstered, in plain view, (defined by local authorities as on the dash of the car) with the clip and all ammunition locked in a separate container, stored out of reach. (in my case locked in the ammo box in the trunk.) Yes, that was quite a while ago.<br />
That situation makes it useless for personal protection, while still being legal to own.<br />
<br />
Currently 44 states have some type of licensed concealed weapon permit system. Florida was the first to implement one in 1987.<br />
That is where the majior changes in gun control have taken place.<br />
Yeah, here come the links.<br />

<br />
http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/493636.html<br />
<br />
Yes, they do tend to have a pro-gun slant, but those combined with the violent crime statistics compiled by the FBI make for compelling reading.<br />
<br />
I am not trying to attribute the reductions solely to the introduction of concealed carry permits, those combined with other programs aimed at reducing crime do appear to work though.  <br />
<br />
As far as tighter controls go, I honestly dont see how they would effect any change to criminal possession of firearms unless they instituted completely unconstitutional search and seizures at checkpoints or something of that nature. As it is now, I can obtain a gun easier illegally than legally, without any sort of waiting period or background check. Provided of course that I am willing to accept the risk of capture and imprisonment for doing so.<br />
  <br />
The United States in particular has an incredibly large border which is difficult to patrol when you are trying to stop smugglers. Just take a look at the drug trade, or prohibition for examples of supplying any illegal market. <br />

If that is indeed the case then that's actually a stroke against carrying.

<br />
I thought you were arguing that gun control was to cut down on crime?  Now you're criticizing it as if gun ownership was supposed to be a method of reducing crime?  The fact guns don't effect crime rates is an argument that they should be banned to cut down on accidents?  I think you need to either clarify what you are saying here, or rethink it, because unless I'm missing something, that doesn't make a lot of sense to me.</div></div><hr />

This might explain why he doesn't make any sense right now :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u217"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p217">So your arguement amounts to this.  My feeling of security, my ability to defend myself, my home, my family, and my community should all be taken away from me because someone else somewhere might get ahold of a legal firearm and use it irresponsibly or for illegal purposes.  But you see that arguement doesn't really fly here in the U.S.  Law abiding citzens aren't typically penalized for the actions of people who aren't.  You can't argue that hundreds of thousands of people need to be restricted in their rights because a small hand full each year can't be trusted.<br />
<br />
If we agreed that was a valid arguement, we would build huge mass transit systems and severely restrict automobile ownership because a hand full of people can't be trusted to drive safely.  The fact that a fire arm is designed to be used to wound or kill and the car is designed as transportation is irrelevant.  You either use them responsibly and within the law, or you don't.  If you want to argue that one should be banned to the masses because of the misuses of the few, then you logicially must argue that they both should be banned to the masses because of the misuses of the few.  This is hardly going to happen.<br />
<br />
I would even argue that alcohol, a legal drug, is misused on a more regular basis and with by a larger number of people than fire arms.  I'd even argue that it accounts for more deaths each year.  I'd argue that the reasons for legalizing and allowing alcohol consumption are less important than the ones for allowing ownership of fire arms.  Yet, we don't outlaw alcohol, we arrest those people found to be using it in violation of the law.  When used responsibly, no penalty is leveled.  When used irresponsibly, severe penalties are leveled.  It is expected that the average citizen will use good judgement and reasonable prudence in the use of alcohol.  Can we trust people to use good judgement and reasonable prudence?  Why can they be trusted to drink responsibly but can't be trusted to own a fire arm responsibly?  Why can they be trusted to drive responsibly, but can't be trusted to own a fire arm responsibly?  And why should it be that because some people can't be responsible, that all fire arm owners should be penalized and restricted when the same is not true for car owners or drinkers?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u218"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p218">The fact guns don't effect crime rates <br />
<br />
Minor point, as I try and keep my head low in this thread(made my position statement and am basically done, other than reading), but there are too many factors influencing crime rates to be sure of gun laws effect on crime rates.  It is impossible to test or measure just that effect on crime rates.  Very minor point, carry on now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u219"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p219">Had a nap and come back to this heh :)<br />
<br />
It's all in the 'relative' levels. I don't agree with the current level of gun control in my own country, it's overly restrictive due to a knee jerk public pleasing response after our one 'columbine' incident (incidentally was that the change in the law you were referring to Brutul? when talking about increased controls leading to more crime?, if so it 's irrelevant as virtually nobody carried guns for personal protection prior to the changes anyway). <br />
<br />
Glatius, The primary two arguements that've been put forward by pro-right to bear arms folks are that a) A proficient and well armed public serves as a 'final sanction' to protect itself from undemocratic elements wether internal or external. and b) They provide an individual with a form of lethal self defence and cut down on crime by providing a deterrant. <br />
<br />
It's pretty much accepted (and the figures clearly and unambigiuosly seem to state it) that the 'trade off' for this is an increased number of deaths from improper useage, wether criminal or accidental. <br />
<br />
In debate on this subject the benefits are thought by pro-arms folks to outweigh the disadvantages. If those benefits are NOT in fact truely effective then greater control might be felt to be worthwhile. I see no lack of logic in that arguement. <br />
<br />
Generally speaking I have to feel that giving the power of life and death to anyone who wants it (and yes I'm aware there are controls, this is where the relative levels of things come in) is not neccessarily a good idea, not when in the heat of the moment an instrument such as a gun can be used to end the life of another human being with a single muscular spasm. I don't personally trust people in general with that power, the fact that in order to protect my countries democratic rights it is neccessary for someone to bear arms I don't ignore - for such a reason the armed forces are a 'neccessary evil'. Since I don't dismiss peoples freedoms either i agree that 'well regulated' access to firearms for personal leisure is neccessary - but it's all in the degree. I don't think asking people to walk around with an instrument of potential lethality on the order of a gun and expecting them to always use that power correctly is a rational approach. People make mistakes, happens all the time in the armed services but it goes with the job and must be accepted, why accept it in the civilian population unless it actually provides society overall with a benefit? That's the crux of the arguement.<br />
<br />
On to the good old 'drinking kills too' arguement :)<br />
<br />
Drinking as a legalised drug is here with us to stay, there's no way a government could outlaw it and survive election, perhaps that's also true of firearms in america (/shrug). <br />
<br />
Drinking can, like smoking (and perhaps guns?) probably be shown to ultimately provide more hassle and deaths than the benefits it provides, that doesn't mean that because we cannot ask people to be absolutely tee-total we cannot try to limit firearms, to turn the arguement on it's head since you favour guns and you reckon they're no more lethal than alcohol and it's up to people to be respected to deal with it correctly, shouldn't you also favour legally obtained hard core drugs, bare knuckle boxing, base jumping from public monuments, etc etc etc? Why do societies have rules against them but not alcohol? <br />
<br />
Same 'unfair' reason most other civilised countries have rules limiting firearms but not alcohol.<br />
<br />
/shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u220"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p220">Red, not proper evidence but I'd like us to go back to the 1950's - in both the US and the UK at that time violent crime and indeed all crime rates were I believe much lower than they are today. As we moved on to the turn of the century crime rates got worse in both countries, as did suicide rates I believe that indicates that owning firearms or not owning firearms has little bearing on the factors that generate criminal activity. i also believe however that placing 'more' firearms into that cocktail would lead to more deaths.<br />
<br />
Off on a tangent and perhaps explaining why a country with such heavy handed firearm controls has such a crime problem.<br />
<br />
My own country in my opinion is in an total mess. Extreme Liberal minded thinking pervades the justice system, such that a farmer that killed (in probable self defence) a burglar with his legally owned shot gun is not allowed his home visit prior to release because it is considered that there is a risk he will re-offend (yep, they don't want him loose cause he's a danger to burglars! ) The police force is stretched to it's limit, underfunded, overworked and has to spend a large percentage of it's time filling in paper work, morale obviously isn't particularly high.<br />
<br />
I'm not in the least surprised that crime rates are on an upward trend, add to that a societal trend towards total disrespect for authority (which I would again lay at the doors of the liberal minded idiots, along with a good doseage of lack of self-respect and national pride, for which I would blame 'mostly' left wing politicians that used every chance to denigrate the country as an attack on their opponents and now wonder why, now that they have power,  nobody is very upbeat and constructive :p ). It's a wonder that I can still feel safe on the streets really, I still don't favour firearms for personal protection, in the current climate I think that'd actually be far worse overall than keeping them off the streets as much as we can....</div></div><hr />

<br />
Same 'unfair' reason most other civilised countries have rules limiting firearms but not alcohol.<br />
<br />
Yet when alcohol has no more benefit to society than as an acceptable leisure time intoxicant when used appropriately and lawfully we see no reason to ban it even though it clearly rivals guns in the harm that it causes.  However, we can show a much clearer justification for public access, within reason, to fire arms.  I can't conclusively say whether having fire arms in the home adds or detracts from crime.  I can say that typically those individuals with fire arms in their homes feel safer, it's impossible to judge whether or not their perceptions are true, but often times perceptions are enough.  <br />
<br />
I've already made my case regarding the Constitutional safe guards built into our right to bear arms and the reasons for them.  Alcohol hardly qualifies as having either of these very important justifications for it's acceptance by society.  So if society as a whole can accept the harm of alcohol based on no more justification than it's &quot;enjoyable&quot; to occassionally toss back a few, then it shouldn't be hard for society to accept that allowing people the right to bear arms is &quot;enjoyable&quot;, &quot;gives many of them a feeling of increased security&quot;, and &quot;is one of the foundation rights built into our system of government as a balance against tyranny&quot; even when balanced against the harm guns do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, somebody probably did :).  I wasn't implying that that law caused the increase in crime in the UK.  It may have had an effect, who knows?  I agree wholeheartedly that there are many factors that affect the crime rate, and attributing a trend to a single factor is probably simple-minded and incorrect.  The fact remains however, that I have seen no evidence that strict gun laws will have a dramatic (or even significant) positive effect on crime rates.<br />
<br />

<br />
I would add to that list the fact that there are many legitimate uses for firearms that millions of people take part in daily, and denying people the right to enjoy their hobbies without a compelling reason is wrong.<br />
<br />
shouldn't you also favour legally obtained hard core drugs, bare knuckle boxing, base jumping from public monuments, etc etc etc? Why do societies have rules against them but not alcohol? <br />
<br />
If I was king, none of those things would be illegal.  If people want to kill themselves, and they're not hurting other people, that's just fine with me.  People that hurt themselves doing this kind of thing could expect to pay their own medical bills though.  I wouldn't defend the right to bare-knuckle boxing as vigorously as the right to bear arms, but as long as it's between two consenting adults that understand the risks they are taking, I would not forbid them to go knock each other's brains out if that's what they really wanted to do. <br />

Just cause one form of 'dangerous' entertainment is allowed to pass relatively unopposed doesn't mean you cannot argue against another form, especially when that other form is extremely lethal in the wrong hands. A drink driver kills by chance, it's accidental and as such is on a par with accidental death due to improper handling of a fire arm. In addition however, someone killing another person has a very firm goal in mind, guns make it that little bit easier to fit thought to deed, not something that can be said for a can of budweiser.....The potential of the two - (drinking &amp; firearms) are not really all that comparable.</div></div><hr />

Actually they are.  If you're worried about people being injured or killed, does it really matter if it's intentional or unintentional?  Does it make it somehow more exceptable that huge numbers of people are killed or injured as long as it's accidental?  Do people's intentions really have that much bearing on it?  Dangerous is dangerous, right?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Interestingly enough, according to the CDC statistical data on Nonfatal and Fatal Firearm-Related Injuries  United States, 1993  1997<br />
 Overall, annual nonfatal and fatal firearm-related injury rates declined consistently from 1993 through 1997. The annual nonfatal rate decreased 40.8%, from 40.5 per 100,000 (95% CI=22.6-58.4) in 1993 to 24.0 per 100,000 (95% CI=13.8-34.1) in 1997. This decline was accompanied by a decrease of 21.1% in the annual death rate from 15.4 per 100,000 (95% CI=15.2-15.5) in 1993 to 12.1 per 100,000 (95% CI=12.0-12.3) in 1997.<br />
<br />
http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm4845a1.htm<br />
<br />
This occurred during a time when more and more states were adopting concealed carry license legislation.  While these figures cannot be attributed directly to the reduction of violent criminal acts coinciding with the introduction of the new policies, they also do not reflect any increase in the number of deaths or injuries with the increased licensed use of handguns.  <br />
<br />
These figures suggest, to me at least, that it isnt the number of guns that matters, its who has them and how they are used that count.<br />
<br />
As for any comparison of civilians carrying concealed weapons to either the police or military you must remember that a citizen permitted to carry a weapon for defense is still limited to defending themselves or others from immediate threat of violent assault risking life or grievous bodily injury. Being the victim of a mugging, rape, or attempted murder does not leave much room for a gray area in the interpretation of self-defense.<br />
<br />

Generally speaking I have to feel that giving the power of life and death to anyone who wants it (and yes I'm aware there are controls, this is where the relative levels of things come in) is not neccessarily a good idea, not when in the heat of the moment an instrument such as a gun can be used to end the life of another human being with a single muscular spasm<br />
My apologies for not continuing the entire quote, but I would like to point out that, in the US at least that doesnt appear to be a problem for either society or law enforcement.<br />
<br />
 Opponents of the new licensing laws argue that more guns on city streets can only lead to more violence and deaths; that the laws will transform the streets of America into &quot;Dodge City,&quot; as previously law-abiding citizens take to settling hot-headed arguments over fender benders and slights to their dignity with guns; that the carrying of weapons by ordinary citizens jeopardizes the safety of the police; that citizens' lack of training will lead to false confidence in or unrealistic expectations about the usefulness of firearms, with the possible result that license holders will take foolish risks; that due to insufficient training, license holders will lack good judgment in determining when it is appropriate to shoot, resulting in wrongful shootings and wrongful brandishing of firearms; or that insufficient proficiency with their weapons will result in the shooting of innocent bystanders or loved ones. <br />
While opponents of licensing laws are not wrong to point out that those adverse results are potential consequences of the widespread carrying of weapons, we need no longer speculate about what the effects of such laws might be. We now have at least 10 years of actual evidence from 25 different states with diverse rural and metropolitan populations, including the cities of Miami, Houston, Dallas, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, New Orleans, Seattle, and Portland, regarding perhaps as many as 1 million permit holders carrying their weapons for hundreds of millions of man-hours. The results are in, and they show unequivocally that (a) the number of persons currently in possession of permits to carry firearms ranges from 1 to 5 percent of the state's population; (b) criminals do not apply for permits; (c) permit holders do not take to settling their traffic disputes or arguments with guns, or &quot;take the law into their own hands&quot;; (d) shall-issue licensing states have almost no problems with violent criminality or inappropriate brandishing of firearms by permit holders; and (e) some permit holders have used their guns to defend themselves and others. There appears to be no reported case of any permit holder adjudged to have wrongfully killed another in connection with carrying and using his weapon in public. As of this writing, shall-issue licensing laws are creating no reported law enforcement problem in any of the 25 states that have enacted them. Dodge City has not returned; the blood is not running in the streets.<br />

Im not trying to convince anyone that licensed firearms in public hands are the Holy Grail of crime prevention. There are many other factors and programs in place that affect the overall crime rate to a greater or lesser degree, however, what I have seen does not bear out the predictions of the anti-gun side of the issues.<br />
<br />
In effect, what we have seems to be working in our society as it is now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sure, I understand that you would.  Because of course the potential for harm is much greater with an AK-47 than a handgun.  All the same if people have the intention, the means will be found.  The Oklahoma bombing used fertilizer.  The 9/11 attack used hijacked aircraft.  If people want to kill, they're going to kill.  If people want to kill a lot of people, they're going to kill a lot of people.</div></div><hr />

Once in a while, yes, we're going to have an incident.  However, they could just as easily hijacked a diseal truck and drove it into the school.  *shrug* Like I said, if the intent is there, the means can and will be found.</div></div><hr />

thing is schools in the USA have stagnated, their policys suck (before i left, being out sick cost you 20$'s and parking for a semester cost you 50$, lunch was 8$ a shot when it was 4 the previuos year, all because they had a budget cut, they wanted to keep their 4 secretarys so they milked the student, pissing alot of us off) the school's are turning out bad children who in turn become bad adults, then the schools want to scapgoat it to media violence and so forth, when really going thru 12 years of school gets you in enough fist fights to know what violence is</div></div><hr />

<br />
All the biggest 'preventable' disasters are. <br />
<br />
How about Gericks restaurant employee examples? Not as newsworthy as columbine but all the more dangerous for lack of ability to predict i'd think. How many duplicate 'minor' incidents occur across the country each year? How much does treating gunshot wounds cost hospitals etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
the Columbine kids were indeed building pipe bombs in their garage <br />
<br />
Betcha if they'd used their home built pipe bombs the casualties would have been lower ..<br />
<br />
Aaanyway, let me expand a bit on why i think firearms deserve greater controls than most other means of causing peoples ends.<br />
<br />
Lets go back to why people enjoy using firearms as a hobby. It's basically all about directing and controlling a 'powerful' force/item to do what you desire it to (hit a bullseye). To a smaller extent a mild frisson of danger helps increase the attraction. Now there is absolutely nothing at all wrong with that (heck I drive cars that I cannot legally use even half the performance of on the open road)... so long as the person using it acts responsibly. <br />
<br />
A person acting on high emotion or from an unstable personality isn't gonna act responsibly i'm sure we all agree. In such 'dangerous cases' these people seek to 'make a statement'  typically by placing themselves in the position of control that they feel they lacked and which prompted them to their actions. What form of weapon gives them more personal, deadly control, more 'power' than the gun? It's the perfect means for them to express themselves (violently and personally), and it's fairly easy to get a hold of one. <br />
<br />
Everyone suffers stress and tension in their lives i'm not sure a psych test every few months is gonna be able to yank out the 'average guy that goes a bit nuts'. <br />
<br />
The worst offenses happen with malice aforethought, agreed. If someone plans to do something then there's no way you can prevent them unless you detect the problem before hand but you can limit their options 'more'.  <br />
<br />
Then you have the flipside, how many people with emotion high and a split second to decide make the 'wrong' choice with a gun readily to hand? It seems to me that guns make death too easy.<br />
<br />
Bah, i don't feel I've explained that as clearly as i could have i guess.<br />
<br />
/shrug<br />

Like has been said throughout this thread, it's all about the trade offs, and from my admittedly biased point of view, the positives i'm hearing posited don't appear to balance the downside of the current level of freedom you have.<br />
<br />
Just out of personal interest Jat5, are their any figures on how many crimes 'concealed carrier licences' have prevented as a percentage of overall crimes committed?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Much of what you say has merit, but it really comes down to an individual decision as to whether or not the positives balance the negatives.  To you, they don't.  To me, and people like me, they do.  Life is risk.  People have road rage and use their cars as battering rams.  People get angry and grap a hunk of pipe and whack people over the head.  There is no way we can completely pre-empt the behavior of angry people.  All we can do is punish them afterwards.  The fact that people get angry and do things they shouldn't, shouldn't mean everyone else has to give up something they value just to make the means that angry people prefer harder to get.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're slightly misunderstanding my point. <br />
<br />
...don't appear to balance the downside of the current level of freedom you have.<br />
<br />
I have never favoured a total ban on firearms ownership, nor do the laws of my own country - despite getting to my mind overly harsh since the school incident here. A certain amount of sacrifice in the way of greater controls in order to limit the instances of extreme misuse seems perfectly rational to me, however.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are controls.  Whether or not there are enough is the debate.  In honesty it is the perception of many believers in the right to bear arms that every time another control is put in place, no matter how rational or reasonable, you weaken the defense against irrational or unreasonable controls.  After all, I don't know if it's the case in Britain, but here in the U.S. it seems that law makers have to make repetative laws for everything, simply to justify their continued existance, or so it seems.  It wouldn't take long, if left unchecked, for them to completely remove all access to fire arms.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u245"><b>Jat5</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p245">Is this something along the lines you were looking for Valeris? It isn't strictly concealed carry, it does include 'in home' defence which wouldn't be limited to the concealed carry permit.<br />
<br />
Other than that I've not run across anything yet.<br />
<br />
About three-fourths of the victims who used firearms for<br />
self-defense did so during a crime of violence, 1987-92 <br />

                      themselves or their property                <br />
                      ________________________________________<br />

motor vehicle theft.20,300...5,100............15,200<br />
<br />
from Bureau of Justice Statistics.<br />
<br />
Other than that there's really no way to track how many potential crimes have been averted simply because the criminal thought the potential victim &quot;might&quot; have been armed. Unless you attribute the entire crime rate reduction previously stated to concealed carry permits.<br />

<br />
That's cool.  But most people aren't that badass.  A gun makes a pretty significant difference if you're not combat skilled and the other person is bigger and has violent intent.  *shrug*<br />
<br />
Owning a gun doesn't make you a potential threat, being someone who will use violence to settle a situation that it isn't appropriate for does.  There are many people who are violent and dangerous who don't own guns.  There are many people who are perfectly reasonable and non-violent who do.  One doesn't necessarily cause or lead to the other.</div></div><hr />

I convinced him I was on his side, took him to lunch to discuss strategy, and called my building security on my cell phone from the men's room there asking them to review the tape and send the cops to where we were eating. They did.<br />

Seriously though, you have that right, of course.  You can lable people who have guns as potentially unstable.  I wouldn't draw that line myself, because I haven't met everyone with a gun for &quot;protection&quot; and therefore don't feel confident drawing such a broad conclusion.  I've met a lot of very unstable people in my life, and most did not have a gun.</div></div><hr />

Indeed, and as part of the concealed carry permit requirements (in most states I have checked) training includes non-violent dispute resolution conducted by law enforcement instructors.<br />
<br />
Not directed at you in particular BB, but too many people have the impression that getting a permit is like flicking a pez dispenser.<br />
<br />
I seriously doubt anyone who has a concealed carry permit remains unaware of the gravity of the situation or of the responsibility for it's use.</div></div><hr />
