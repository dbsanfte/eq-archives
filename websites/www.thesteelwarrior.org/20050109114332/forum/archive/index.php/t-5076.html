Me?  I want a big fucking sword.  Master of weapons and all armed combat, I want to lick the blood off my blade as I cleave giants in half, feel the earth shake as I slay dragons in one felling blow, and hear my opponent's jawbone snap as I riposte his face in with the back of my gauntlet.  A shield?  No thanks.  War was never meant to be civilized.<br />
<br />
:P</div></div><hr />

<br />
Personally, if I could hold aggro as well as with a regular DW setup, but mitigate better - I would definately consider it. Which means that Bash-with-a-shield should draw considerable more aggro. Blocking hits / AC boost to secondary slot should be fairly high or the difference in mitigation will be too small to matter.<br />
<br />
However, as it stands now, this is not the case, which makes shields worthless.<br />
Any shield changes should only affect shields themselves though, not the weapon in mainhand .. etc. etc. ... that makes no sense after all.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I still have the Warrior only shield from POF in the bank.<br />
It's been in there for several years.<br />
Perhaps one day I will take it out and bash a garden snake with it.<br />
And then I'll put it back.<br />
<br />
That's how worthless shields are right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">01-05-2004, 11:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Shields aren't worthless.<br />
<br />
For those classes that aren't expected to do significant melee damage, shields often have big time AC, stats, and even effects. It gives them the option of putting something useful in their offhand should they choose to use a one hander in their primary slot.<br />
<br />
Like any piece of armor a shield's AC protects the user. As a bonus, melees (Why just melees? /em shrug) get modest damage by bashing with it.<br />
<br />
Shields are perfect right now for those that choose to hide behind a &quot;portable wall&quot;. Boost the value of shields and to be fair ya must find a boost for those that fight with weapon/s in their hands. Block reposts? Then add an offhand parry reposte. Additional mitigation - for a piece of armor? What's next? Dual Weilded Shields with double-bash?<br />
<br />
What would it take for Warriors to use shields? Lessee:<br />
<br />
1. Near double damage from the primary hand - a lot of us have Ambidexterous and do significant damage with our off hand.<br />
<br />
2. Near double proc frequency from the primary hand.<br />
<br />
3. High quality Warrior only shields to drop like snow flakes in a blizzard to make up for the fact most warriors have spent 4 years not even caring if they ever looted one.<br />
<br />
4. Warrior shield effects on par with the best melee and caster effects on Paladin and SK shields.<br />
<br />
5. Warriors fight and not hide. We should have a higher bash rate and stun frequency - a Warrior would only use a shield if it were an offensive tool. We don't carry them to protect ourselves from enemy lances when jousting.<br />
<br />
6. Unique graphics - no Warrior would want to be asked for a Res or Brells. I'm thinking maybe a slogan like that guy's wallet in Pulp Fiction.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renix</div><div class="date">01-06-2004, 02:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I haven't used a shield, except back when I bothered to ghetto-bash.<br />
<br />
I don't plan on using one at all, unless theres some sort of significant benefit, such as:<br />
<br />
*Being able to block incoming attacks<br />
*Having a modified proc rate(at least 3 procs/minute, compared to the current estimate of 2), and having either a static (+5?) or +% damage modifier for the main hand weapon<br />
*New Warrior only shields, with meaningful AC/Stats/HP/Saves/etc, and be relatively easy to obtain (ie: LDoN named drops, low point costs from LDoN, added to drop tables of common loot zones such as veksar, etc...)<br />
<br />
Some other extras would be nice, but not required, like:<br />
<br />
<br />
*Make bash have 65~% accuracy (as pretty much all weapons with capped skill do) regardless of skill, and make the stun portion % chance of landing and length of time based on your skill (example: 0 second stun with 5% chance of landing with 0 bash skill, 1 second stun with a 15% chance of landing with 100 skill, etc...)<br />
<br />
Some of it may be a bit overpowered, but it can all be tweaked. I highly doubt shields will be worth using any time soon though....</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dont have a decent 2hander for MTing.  I am still stuck with BoC and a Hategiver. <br />
<br />
If I need the extra AC, I use Hategiver and Stormrider Carapace. <br />
<br />
Of course I still need to build up the aggro with dualwield first and get some procs in or else aggro will ping pong at start.<br />
<br />
I hope they do something about shields sometime in the near future. Increased proc rate, increased dmg bonus for mainhand, increased atk, increased dmg to bash and block/parry modifiers would make shields a great thing. <br />
<br />
I will keep using a shield to cut some of the riposte damage until I can get my hands on a BoW/SEWS.</div></div><hr />

forget that, make all PAL/SK weapons useable by warriors when a sheild is equiped <br />
<br />
if you gained the blocking skill?<br />
<br />
.this is going to be given to all classes that can use a shield they said they planned to make more insentives to classes that hardly ever use shields(warriors) but not make it uber for people that use it constantly(shamans, clerics etc <br />
<br />
<br />
if it increased your proc rate by 50%?<br />
<br />
That would be nice <br />
<br />
if it actually increased hate generated by procs?<br />
<br />
That would be nice, but i think its eather a higher proc rate or more hate, not both <br />
<br />
or would you rather continue using dual wield/2hd weapons?<br />
<br />
 I think there needs to be a good reason to DW(reposites or upped parrys?) a good reason for 2 handers(lots of damage) and sword+sheild( less damage or complete absorbed damage at random timed).<br />
<br />
 trying to think of ways that SoE could actually make shields useful to dual wielding classes.<br />
<br />
how about a buckler? those small round shields that can be attached to bracers and arm guards? or the combination pauldron/sheild like the roman warriors had on 1 arm, it would have to have a smaller number of blocks than a paladin shield, since it is smaller, that would balance it</div></div><hr />

<br />
if it did that and gave a chance to block as well even more would use it?<br />
<br />
or would it pretty much remain the same with the shields being used for certain mobs/times? rampage tanking, omg the healer died, have initial aggro lock just reducing damage taken.<br />
<br />
<br />
the stun parts that others mentioned would be nice to have. i would def use one on casters and ghetto bash for those times (and im pretty damn lazy).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anker steadfast</div><div class="date">01-06-2004, 10:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Problem also is that there are very few Furious Bash shields in game, and if you are not in a good raiding guild, you will never see one.<br />
<br />
So if a change is to be made, it should apply to all shields a warrior can equip - From the evry first buckler at level 1, to the biggest and baddest shield you can find.<br />
<br />
Otherwise, shields will still suck for 95% of all warriors.</div></div><hr />

A 2H weapon means that it takes TWO hands to use.<br />
Anything else is just dumbing things down again.<br />

1H + Shield = 2H<br />
2H = 2H (duh :p )<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arathena</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 10:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ideally, I'd think, there should be significant defensive bonuses to wearing a real shield, for both warriors and knights. Of course, I aslo think there should be a measurable, but less than shield bonus, for dual wielding. <br />
<br />
The sole reason to wear a shield is to stick a chunk of something between you and the other guy. Small to medium stat boosts just don't cut it any more as a simulation of that wall, given the major sacrifice of damage output. Meanwhile, the presence of an offhand weapon is as much the presence of a second blade to parry with as it is a second blade to thrust with. This should be taken care of too. <br />
<br />
In short, I would, as a knight, use a one hander and shield if, and only if, it caused me to require a total of less healing over the course of an exp mob than I would take by using a two hander. This could be by avoidance bonuses, block, etc, but as it stands right now, there's no reason for any tank to wear a shield.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anker steadfast</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 01:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The even more absurd part of this, is that they wanted to raise the mitigation high enough to make it worth not Dual Wielding / using a 2H over a 1H + Shield, is that they would have to slap somewhere around +200 AC on a shield with the way it currently work.<br />
<br />
And even then the effect would probably not be all that big.<br />
They really screwed up on shields in most cases.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khumak</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 04:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only way I'd use a shield is if my DPS was around 80% of what it was with DW or 2h, equivalent aggro control, and at least 5-10% better mitigation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anker steadfast</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 11:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd use it if I was still doing about 60% damage of a Duwlwield setup, but mitigated 20% more, with about the same amount of aggro.<br />
<br />
Anything less and it's simply not worth it, since you would then be better off with a 2H weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stikka</div><div class="date">01-08-2004, 02:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well there is historical precident for using a shield and 2h long spear as the heavy variant of the Greek Hoplite used a shield strapped to the upper left arm and a damn great big pike, but for EQ purposes it isn't practical. If nothing else for some inexplicable reason Warriors pierce skill caps 10 points lower than their slash and blunt skills.<br />
<br />
IF warriors could do real damage with a shield which is logical anyway as being smacked by a huge bloke with a portable manhole cover is a tad nastier than a wasp sting and IF it upped Parry skill significantly which again is logical then it might be of value.<br />
<br />
Plus of course if Furious Bash was working it would up the viability of a shield.<br />
<br />
Simple fact is SOE can't be bothered to fix shields for Warriors so the vast majority go for a good 2h and stick with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Heimdall-RN</div><div class="date">01-08-2004, 04:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">SoE/VI really underutilized Shields, and frankly I'm surprised with the insane amount of ideas they've blatantly ripped off from DAOC- Styles, the new Tradeskill thing, what sounds like they're going to do with shields, and so on down the line, I'm surprised they didn't rip off the entire shield system from over there sooner... Melee over there can train in the &quot;shield&quot; skill.  You train in it, and your skill level determines your block %.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Norfolk:Brell</div><div class="date">01-13-2004, 01:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Im not gonna try coming up with any specifics but here are a few basics they need to meet for to make shields viable for warriors.<br />
<br />
1) Flat out, bash needs to do more damage. (kick too!)<br />
<br />
2) Shields need to provide a greater defensive bonus, not just from melee, but from magic and combat effects as well. We've all seen the paintings where an armor clad hero is using a large shield to protect himself from a dragons breath. Make it happen in game!<br />
<br />
3) Why cant you kick and bash at the same time? they fixed the links on discs, (sort of) unlink bash and kick too.<br />
<br />
4) there has to be a bonus for the mainhand when using a shield, even if its nothing more than increased hit accuracy.<br />
<br />
5) As I have always said, quite simply Warrior usable weapons need better damage/delay ratios. better damage output from the mainhand would help justify the sacrifice of offhand damage output.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So in experience groups that will NEVER happen. <br />
<br />
On raids, yes maybe if there was concrete evidence that it actually made a difference. IE if a parser can tell the difference without a 10000 hour test-run.<br />
<br />
If the GoD shield spec skill is merely placebo stuff like the +8% dodge and parry mods we can get today, then no thanks.<br />
<br />
Of course I dont even presently own a shield, so would have to go acquire one if they become even remotely viable in GoD ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is some positive sides to useing a shield + 1h when MTing.<br />
<br />
The riposte dmg is lower than dw of course and the HP gain and AC gain compared to most 2h gives the MT abit more margin against single rounding.<br />
<br />
I would say that 1h + shield (both of the same quality as the 2h or 2 1hs) is better in all situation as a MT.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A 2H sword is a 2h Sword because you use 2 hands to use it - DUH.<br />
The most important is that the fighting style is totally different, a 2H sword would make a LOUSY 1H sword.<br />
Amount of strength is less important actually.</div></div><hr />

I only have a stormrider carapace and I notice a considerable difference in damage taken.  When things start to get a little shaky I put a SeM in mainhand chain hit the bash/taunt button.  Agro is no problem by then because clerics rarely get to that point before agro is set.  On the mobs that memblur often in the elementals, this has less usufullness because regaining agro is not as fast.<br />

<br />
You parry with your weapon and have a chance to block like the monks do. There should not be a damage upgrade. When you cant hold aggro with it.. dont use it.<br />
<br />
I normally use my BoW but I tested the shield ( stormrider carpace ) together with a Stone Etched Mallet when I am solotanking the named without defense while the others are killing the adds in phase 1 of time. Its feeling a bit safer cause of the 100 more hp the 60 more ac and the rune2 procs. With the delay of 28 there are not really much more ripostes than with a BoW (32) and the damage I loose is ok, cause its gives the others time to kill the trash.<br />
<br />
I used the shield also when tanking the adds in ssra/emperor but thats all where you can use it.</div></div><hr />

On mobs like TZ or Bert I always duel wield for max agro though.  I am kinda excited about the new shield AA's personally.</div></div><hr />
