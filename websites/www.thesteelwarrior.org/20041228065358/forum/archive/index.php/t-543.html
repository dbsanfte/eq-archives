I heard a rumor that it doesnt - our guild is short on EB weapons and we are checking XTC pretty regularly but he is showing us no love. If he isnt dropping it, then we could make him less of a priority.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Auron</div><div class="date">05-09-2003, 09:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">not that i can confirm it, but i see no reason for them to take this weapon out of the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iskandar</div><div class="date">05-09-2003, 09:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's just a bitch of a drop. 13 kills before my guild saw 1 HG. Honestly in my experience you're better off killing Cursed (if you have to pick between XTC and Cursed).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smohg</div><div class="date">05-09-2003, 11:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well - AOW, XTC, Cursed are all in the line up. Hard to find those up - they are killed pretty quickly. We are working toward RZ now and are thinking of killing the POI dragon a few more times also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerald</div><div class="date">05-09-2003, 12:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Seriously people need to be quicker to dismiss rumors of weapons being removed after being in the game forever. Hategiver still drops, it's just really rare. We've gotten 1 in probably 7-8 kills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lelara</div><div class="date">05-09-2003, 12:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey Gerald,<br />
<br />
You are so lucky that you even had one droped.<br />
Everytime myguild has taken down XTC, he has droped everything else at least once so far except any Hategiver. It does feel like XTC doesn't drop anymore but we still take him down when we can.<br />
<br />
Curse drop for Bloodfrenzy to me is just as bad too. One drop out of 7-8 kills so far.<br />
<br />
So AoW will be considered the most easiest to get an Enraging Blow weapon.<br />
<br />
The PoI dragon weapon drop is like a semi-common weapon.<br />
<br />
I have no experiance with Rallos Zek yet.<br />
<br />
<br />
To Smohg, don't give up your hopes yet. Keep trying.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hulanta</div><div class="date">05-09-2003, 01:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First time we tried creator he was holding two Hategivers... it was sad that we couldn't down him yet.</div></div><hr />

There was some happy warriors that day of which I was one.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kellaen</div><div class="date">05-09-2003, 11:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We've gotten 1 HG in like ugh 8 or 9 kills by now. All ssra gives us is 2h knight shit and tendonslicers &gt;&lt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grimmlokk</div><div class="date">05-10-2003, 12:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think we got 1 in 10-12 kills or so. It's just rare is all. AoW is still the best source for EB weapons, by far. And, unfortunately, BoC is still pretty much a top notch weapon, for offhand to the elite but top notch none the less.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerald</div><div class="date">05-10-2003, 05:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Breakdown for us is about like this...<br />
<br />
Cursed: 2 Bloodfrenzies, 4 Goldenrods, 2 Renders, 1 Claw, 1 Fang<br />
<br />
Exiled: 1 Blasphemous Blade, 2 Elphorn's Cleavers, 1 Rapier, 4 Caster/priest weapons or so<br />
<br />
XtC: 1 Hategiver, 4 Caster Daggers, I forget what else<br />
<br />
Arch Lich: 6 or so Cleavers, 1 Tendon Slicer, 3-4 Blindfoes, 2 Crusades, 1 Pitchatka<br />
<br />
High Priest: 4 Druid 2HBs, 2 Wrath's Edges, 1 Norge'Tal<br />
<br />
Emp: 1 Ssra Sword, 1 Caen's, 1 Acrylia Broadsword, and a few kills he dropped no weapons</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutalliss</div><div class="date">05-10-2003, 05:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It drops, we got one not long ago. Out of maybe 10 XTC kills we seen one HG.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brudal the Fat</div><div class="date">05-10-2003, 12:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">23 Cursed Kills and 1 Bloodfrenzy which I did not have the points for at the time grrrrrrrrrrrr!<br />
<br />
18 XTC kills 1 Hategiver<br />
<br />
10 AoW kills 4 BoCs<br />
<br />
I have a boc so hategiver not that big a loss but would be nice to see Cursed drop Bloodfrenzy again. I mean, we have like 7 rangers with claws, every beastlord and monk has fangs, 3 or 4 Golden rods, 3 Daggers. <br />
<br />
On the same note in 14 Emp Ssra kills we have had 12 2hs  swords no robes or shawls for casters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">beardo</div><div class="date">05-10-2003, 06:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">HG is better then BOC, cause stats are useless, and it has 25 ac and its a tad faster.<br />
<br />
I think they got the same proc rates too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smakz</div><div class="date">05-11-2003, 03:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">XTC still drops it ... least he did less than a month ago.<br />
<br />
XTC been nice to us.. 3 HGs in about 15 kills or so.<br />
Cursed still being an ass.</div></div><hr />
