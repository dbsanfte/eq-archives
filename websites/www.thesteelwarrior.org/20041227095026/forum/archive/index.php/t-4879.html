<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gront</div><div class="date">12-22-2003, 03:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Taunt is a great skill.  Max hate + 1 gives us a fair shot to regain aggro, but not a lock.  And even as it's currently implemented, there's something I really like about Taunt: it requires a lot of good timing and skill to use appropriately.<br />
<br />
That is, if you sit there mashing the Taunt button like it was...*tries and fails to think of a non-obscene analogy*...well, if you sit there mashing the Taunt button every time it comes up, it won't be there when you need it, and you'll be unable to get aggro back.<br />
<br />
The problem with Taunt?  Even if you use Taunt with utterly optimal skill, even if you never waste a single taunt...<br />
...it still has a 40% chance of dropping you on your ass.<br />
<br />
So here's my suggestion, and I'd like people's opinions on it:<br />
<br />
Make Taunt work 100% of the time...<br />
...and double its refresh time.<br />
<br />
Shoot, if SOE feels unhappy enough, triple its refresh time.  Yeah, that sounds about right.  Instead of failing 40% of the time, and being usable, what, every ten seconds or something,  Taunt works 100% of the time, just like Area Taunt, but we only have it every 30 seconds or so.<br />
<br />
It rewards skillful play, while penalizing button-mashers.  It keeps our overall successful-taunts-per-time roughly constant (actually, lowers it somewhat), but gives us a reliable way to get aggro...if we're careful enough to use it right.<br />
<br />
Well, guys, what do you think?<br />
<br />
SOE?  Your thoughts?<br />
<br />

I'm pretty sure there haven't been any changes to the Taunt skill (other than the failure/success messages).  Am I mistaken?<br />
<br />
AE Taunt?  Nope.  Only affects one mob, not every nearby mob.<br />
<br />
Or, to put it another way, I think it's absurd that the main purpose of &quot;AE Taunt&quot; is not to be area of effect at all, but to be our only reliable taunt.<br />
<br />
*shrug*<br />
<br />
60% success rate on Taunt really reduces the role of skill in playing a warrior.<br />

Incite on incoming, and taunt if the group plays the &quot;Hey? Warriors got aggro lock now right? Lets see!&quot; game.<br />
<br />
I average maybe one to two taunts a fight and try to taunt right before an incite to maximize its effectiveness.<br />
<br />
I really see no point in changing it.</div></div><hr />

Since the big patch I have yet to have anyone die(tho it has been a lot of luck in that too I am sure) due to taunt failure.  I think that asking for more, when we have just gotten so much, might be a bad idea...and I think 100 % taunt on a 30 second timer too much to ask for at any time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, we're not pallies.<br />
<br />
I don't have an issue with pallies having better aggro than we do... as long as ours is good enough to do our job.<br />
<br />
Recent changes (addtional procs via ldon augments and incite) have made it so we have good aggro control.<br />
<br />
We really lose a lot of credibility as a community if we continue to ask for the moon and the stars after the real problem has been fixed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pallies do not  have 100 % agro on demand.  They have better agro than us, with less randomness, but not 100 % sure, top of the hate list agro, instantly with the push of a button.  That is what is being asked for here, on a 30 second timer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Biggwinz</div><div class="date">12-22-2003, 03:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh, sorry you are correct with the exception of low hps they do not have total aggro on demand.<br />
<br />
It is already possible for a pally to lock down a mob so tight you couldnt pull it off him unless you really worked at it.<br />
<br />
I dont see what letting us haveing the same ammount of aggro lock that the pallies have!</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not instant and 100% but it's about as close as you can get.<br />
<br />
Warriors NOT being able to do that is an important part of game balance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">12-22-2003, 05:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is already possible for a pally to lock down a mob so tight you couldnt pull it off him unless you really worked at it.<br />
<br />
I dont see what letting us haveing the same ammount of aggro lock that the pallies have!<br />
<br />
The suggestion here was to have taunt work 100 % of time, but with a 30 second reuse.  First, that would not give us agro lock, as taunt will only put us slightly ahead of the top person on the hate list.  Pallies can generate hate faster above and beyond that.  That is how they get agro lock.  As things are right now, I have agro at slightly less than a pallies, but more than enough for most situations.  Between incite, taunt, procs, and AE taunt, I have enough tools that agro is simply a nonissue 95 % of the time.  What more do you want?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Biggwinz</div><div class="date">12-22-2003, 06:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First of all not everyone is at the end game and has procs and AE taunt. It is really easy to forget that until you play a twink with a buddy who can only play once a month and he is only lvl 55 fighting like there is no tomorrow to keep the aggro in an everyday exp group. (as everyday as you can get with mostly twinks)<br />
<br />
65% of his equipment is stuff that I have handed him down. Sure he has some decent weapons now but he sure as heck is not swinging a BoC.<br />
<br />
So yes I do want taunt to flipping work! And no not for me! It is for all those people who dont play 24/7 and have dont have kick butt gear! So keep your head up in the clouds and imagine that incite is the gods end working fix and EVERYONE'S problems are now all gone!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ummm Taunt does work now.<br />
its called the Provoke line.<br />
If its not working, somebody is doing something wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Biggwinz</div><div class="date">12-23-2003, 04:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No taunt is not working (ok it kinda works but hey), they added a crutch called Provoke, which at high levels, with added aa's and proc'ing weapons you can have decent aggro.<br />
<br />
There should be no drain on Endurance for a ability we naturally have, ie. Taunt!<br />
<br />
I would bet money that you put a lvl 55 warrior with level 55 equipment up against a 55 pally with a rusty weapon the pally can steal the aggro from the warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varalla</div><div class="date">12-23-2003, 05:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ummm... I bet a 55 Pally with a rusty sword can steal aggro from me too.<br />
<br />
Who cares?<br />
Hes supposed to!<br />
Hes a Pally!<br />
<br />
I have decent aggro more approprite to the Warrior class without being over powered. It was the unreliable, accidental and unintentional aggro loss that made warriors suck so bad.<br />
Like many I dont have hate procing weapons so holding aggro was a gamble.<br />
<br />
People pretty much have to go above and beyond the call of duty to get aggro now.<br />
Very few &quot;Oops&quot; losses.<br />
<br />
Even if taunt worked 100% of the time we would have needed the Incite &quot;Crutch&quot;.  Pulling aggro for a quick instant then waiting another 6 seconds for it to refresh didnt cut it for todays stupid casters (Not knocking casters as a whole, just the stupid ones).<br />
<br />
Incite and Taunt work well together.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Biggwinz</div><div class="date">12-23-2003, 07:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No incite and taunt work ok together, it needs to work better. Uping the succes on taunt is what is needed.<br />
<br />
Seeing how we tank that means we have to have aggro. So dont give me this crap, &quot;Hes supose to!&quot; bs. That is not their job they are part tank and part caster. Our whole %*!$# job it to tank. That means the mob has to be pissed off at me!<br />
<br />
Show me one place where is says that pallies are suppose to be the aggro kings!!!<br />
<br />
I am so sick of the whole bs about pallies and them suppose to be kings of of taunt! Number 1 we both have taunt buttons and Number two our skill is higher in taunt. (so by the orginal design who do you think is suppose to be the king of aggro???)<br />
<br />
I dont have heals, I dont have self buffs, I dont have hp buffs that stack with every other buff in the world. I tank and swing my weapons that is it. Period. Do you understand? For me to tank the mobs they have to be more pissed off at me than someone else so that means I have to be the aggro king.<br />
<br />
Sure throw the bs out there about how it trivilizes the game bs. Well i hate to break it to you. Pallies already have this and it is already in the game and Pallies have tanked EVERY end boss out there!<br />
<br />
So coming from me, what ever man. Take a look at the big picture look at what is out there an look at what we offer! I am not even asking for 100% snap aggro but I sure as hell think that my snap aggro should be better than a pallie! That is my one trick pony here, tank mobs and absorb damage.<br />
<br />
So yeah I do think that pally aggro needs to be lowered but hey that is my humble opinion!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varalla</div><div class="date">12-23-2003, 07:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Show me one place where is says that pallies are suppose to be the aggro kings!!!<br />
<br />
Ummm its an opinion of mine.<br />
Just as your idea of us as aggro kings be an opinion of yours.<br />
If your sick of it, learn to live with it.<br />
Its how the game works and will work.<br />
<br />
If the pally can tank a Boss, more power to them.<br />
Will even 5% of pallies tank Bosses? Nope.<br />
<br />
But I can keep aggro on 99% of mobs.<br />
We got the best end of the deal.<br />
<br />
And no its not written, just a rather popular opinion.<br />
<br />
Merry Christmas! *Hugs*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Barraind</div><div class="date">12-23-2003, 09:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For the record, paladin dont have &quot;aggro lock&quot; as way too many people believe we do. <br />
<br />
Its easily testable with warrior + paladin.  Warrior with some aggro proc weapon (can be whatever really) with or without (anger 3 for this test) and paladin with 2 stuns + div stun.<br />
<br />
Both keep meleeing, paladin stuns whenever they pop.<br />
<br />
Warrior will hold aggro a majority of the time (we used Vanazir + 150 ruj dd for me and bow + a3 on the warrior) and in some cases, the paladin is unable to hold aggro at all if the warrior doesnt forget positioning.<br />
<br />
I always joke... I can hold aggro just fine, unless a nuker had a bad day at work, a slower is having a bad day in EQ, or someone with an aggro spell (h8 rangers) decides they want to make me work ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varalla</div><div class="date">12-23-2003, 10:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aggro lock no.<br />
But ye got to admit.<br />
The average Paladin has the edge on the average warrior in regards to aggro, just as the average warrior has the edge on the average paladin in tankage.<br />
<br />
There be an exception to the rule in both extreames, but on average.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daddio</div><div class="date">12-23-2003, 10:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">which at high levels, with added aa's and proc'ing weapons you can have decent aggro. <br />
<br />
At high levels incite allows us to hold agro on three mobs at a time. With all the augments and cheap weapons availible, there's really no excuse not to be able to hold agro anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">12-24-2003, 12:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would bet money that you put a lvl 55 warrior with level 55 equipment up against a 55 pally with a rusty weapon the pally can steal the aggro from the warrior. <br />
<br />
and...?  <br />
<br />
1) Pallies get most of their agro from spells, we get most of our from weapons and taunt(with taunt only giving us agro when we are not top of hate list) and now incite, so what weapon the pally has is pretty irrelevant.<br />
<br />
2) Why are you fighting a pally for agro anyway?  If grouped with a pally, either use their stuns for an agro boost, or let them tank and and go DPS(which we do better than they...tho not much).  I enjoy grouping with a pally, because I can do one of those 2 things.<br />
<br />
3) Currently, one of the balance points(as balance has improved dramatically since patch) is that warriors take a beating better, but knights have more agro and more utility.  It so far seems to be working, as I am seeing more knights lfg, and fewer warriors(it is so nice to turn lfg on, andget a group invite within a few minutes, with 4 or 5 knights lfg...that didn't used to happen).  We seem to have enough agro(note most people are not  complaining), so why worry if some one has more?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Celestias</div><div class="date">12-24-2003, 01:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Taunts fine... why whine, I dont have trouble EVER, maybe it needs to be fix'd for those who dont know aggro management at all or those who arent well equipped versus spells when someone tries sooo hard to get aggro just for the purpose of saying they can get it faster.  Pally's dont tank as well as warriors, most dont want to have aggro if they have a warrior in the group because they know this, its not as efficient, so why take aggro just to prove you can do it better somewhat than a warrior?<br />
<br />
Seriously those complaining about taunt now are really whining a bit to much, I suppose some things will never change, Incite is a good skill and I like it, I use it every now and than but the taunt key works fine, use AE taunt if you absolutely need aggro right that second, otherwise just use incite hit taunt, use spirit of rage if you need it.  I'm happy just having the things I have now, even though I dont feel it was entirely necessary but definetly a help, and now you can compete with pally's for aggro to your hearts content with comparable gear that is, even outaggro them if you try to most of the time.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kolgarath</div><div class="date">12-25-2003, 04:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">disregarding any argument about whether or not pallies have too much aggroe, I would still rather not have the taunt that works 100% every 30 seconds.  If I had taunt that only worked once every 30 seconds I would have a much harder time getting mobs to aggroe on me when there are multiple adds.  Right now if everyone in the group is doing their job properly I can hold aggro without any problems.  This is exactly how I think it should be, and the fact of the matter is I can get groups now just fine, so I could care less about how much aggro pallies get.  I do not in any way want aggro lock and I think the current balance between aggro and damage mitigation for warriors is very good.</div></div><hr />

First lets take a look at Taunt for both classes! What is the cap on Warrior taunt? and what is it on Pallies?<br />
<br />
Hmmm... looks to me like our taunt is capped higher than pallies. So show me where it says that Pallies are supposed to be the king of snap aggro? By the looks of the orginal design we are suppose to be able to &quot;taunt&quot; better.<br />
<br />
I am getting so sick of the &quot;pallies are suppose to be better at snap aggro&quot; bs. I never read that statement anywhere! I would be glad to see it if I missed it. Heck I even remember reading that the designers took a look at the aggro generated by Stun and were amazed at how much it was.<br />
<br />
No one ever said I was fighting pallies for aggro btw. This whole thread started from wanting to up the success/time on aggro. While I may not have agreed with the extream ammount I do truely think that taunt needs to be adjusted.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your constant referance to pally agro makes everyone think that your fighting them for agro. Frankly it gives me that impression too...I mean you spend 2-3 paragraphs talking about how paladins aren't suppose to be king of agros then you talk about your not fighting paladins for agro? :P I feel, that you have done a major self contradiction P at least I do anyways. <br />
<br />
In any case, your referance that because our taunt skill is capped higher means that we are supposed to taunt better is quite true. I would hate to see the taunt failure rate on a paladin's taunt :P <br />
I think you want to see either paladins nerfed badly, or you want our ability to hold agro increased. In my experiance, it already has been, the provoke line gives us (somewhat) adequate agro to hold through some insane spellcasters, once this has been done, with our superior tanking ability(assuming gear levels are equivalent)  it is quite REDUNDANT for the paladin to even WANT agro. In my opnion, this is enough. <br />
<br />
&quot;paladins are suppose to be better at snap agro bs?&quot; To remove a paladin's snap agro is to remove 1/3 of a knight's purpose, they truely are suppose to be better at it, but instead of being an effecient tank, they are suppose to be mana sinks (This is an entirely different problem) <br />
<br />
In the end though...seeing the amount of taunt failures just makes me sick :P but that's how the game is balanced, that's why some level of skill needs to be maintained.</div></div><hr />

^- bullshit. It would take a minute and a half just to fire off three incites. But I suppose this claim is true if your soloing! Hah!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Biggwinz</div><div class="date">12-30-2003, 11:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, we're not pallies.<br />
<br />
I don't have an issue with pallies having better aggro than we do... as long as ours is good enough to do our job. <br />
Ummm... I bet a 55 Pally with a rusty sword can steal aggro from me too.<br />
<br />
Who cares?<br />
Hes supposed to!<br />
Hes a Pally!<br />
 <br />
<br />
This is where my constant referance to pallie aggro comes from. Every time an increase in taunt abilities is proposed someone chimes in and says no pallies are suppose to be the king of snap aggro. BS, plain and simple I have never seen anything that even remotely suggest that.<br />
<br />
So I guess in a sense I am not fighting pallies for aggro. In order for us to tank we have to have aggro and I think that our taunt should be up'd, plain and simple! It does not get much harder that that. Especially at lower levels and for those who are not in &quot;uber&quot; guilds. Before you get the AA's and EB weapons sometimes it just plain sucks to try and hold aggro. The provoke line is just a crutch (although a top of the line crutch). <br />
<br />
When I said no I was not fighting pallies for aggro I took it quite litteraly - No I usually do not have a pallie in my group and no I wasnt fighting one for aggro.<br />
<br />
However I think that pallies stuns aggro should be nerfed! I think it is complete and total bs that they can cast a low lvl spell that the mob is completely immune to and have that generate enough hate that in almost every situation it grabs aggro.<br />
<br />

All the way to level 50, I had no concerns about aggro.  The disparity between my aggro generation and anyone else's wasn't that great (unless they were unbelievably reckless), and the consequences weren't so dire.  If a shaman takes a few blows after a slow, he could easily survive it in the little time it took for me to regain aggro.  I didn't really start struggling until 55 and up.  And, now that warriors can access the  Provoke line @ level 20, it should be even easier.</div></div><hr />

I would bet money that you put a lvl 55 warrior with level 55 equipment up against a 55 pally with a rusty weapon the pally can steal the aggro from the warrior.  <br />
<br />
Sure ... they can with their spells.  But then they are not playing the pally in an effective manner.  The problem that was addressed was not that Pallies and SKs can out agro us if they want to, it was that they would obtain agro lock in the normal process of playing the toon (subject to AETaunt and actually succeeding with a normal taunt).<br />
<br />
My chanter can pull agro at will off my Warrior who has BoC and decent offhander, 350 AA etc...AT WILL.  If he's stupid enough to try.  So can just about any class.  We as warriors can taunt it right back off...or AETaunt it etc.  <br />
<br />
The whole point of the changes was to allow us to compete and do our jobs while the pallies do theirs.   Our abilities had fallen so far behind that we just weren't competitive without hamstringing all the other classes.  We could hold agro, but the nukers had to wait longer than if a pally was MT.  The changes do just that.<br />
<br />
Agro control is the closest to balanced it's ever been right now.  Agro control is not about being able to agro lock a mob...that was an unintended consequence of expansions and levels.  Agro control is EVERYONEs responsiblity to make sure that the main tank, be that a Warrior, pally, sk, monk, ranger etc., maintains agro.</div></div><hr />

A caster could get aggro right after you fired taunt. Having to wait 30 seconds and hope your procs go off is a bad thing &gt;&lt;<br />

The only improvement taunt need is to have a higher success rate. The current 6 second refresh timer is fine as it is.</div></div><hr />

If you read the threads that lead up to the stand down and subsequent SoE response, the main complaints were:<br />
<br />
Agro lock, primarly by Paladans<br />
Lack of Snap Agro.<br />
<br />
Increasing our taunt ability to match or approach what paladans are capable of when they go after agro, which is how I read your statement, would be warrior agro lock.   What you are asking for is exactly that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Biggwinz</div><div class="date">12-30-2003, 05:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It was clearly pointed out in this very thread that pallies do not have 100% snap aggro!</div></div><hr />

Upping our ability to generate hate to the level that a paladan has would give us agro lock.  That has nothing to do with snap agro.<br />

Snap agro in some form was one of the requests made by the community that SoE responded to by giving us the provoke line.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Haha, my math so owned. Guess thats what I get for staying up so long.<br />
<br />
Anyway, regardless, it takes a full minute to incite 3 mobs and it is by no means going to hold aggro on those mobs if debuffers are doing anything at all to them. Meanwhile, a paladin can have all 3 glues to them in like 10 seconds, allowing for full debuffing slowing mezzing and never lose aggro. Even if it wasnt an aggro lock from the paladin, its mere seconds vs a full minute, and any other class could do more than 3 mobs in a very short window.<br />
<br />
If your in an xp group with no forms of corwd control at all, and people arent going to be messing with the adds; sure, it works. But on a raid or a more common group formation it would not work very well.</div></div><hr />

This is where my constant referance to pallie aggro comes from. Every time an increase in taunt abilities is proposed someone chimes in and says no pallies are suppose to be the king of snap aggro. BS, plain and simple I have never seen anything that even remotely suggest that.<br />
<br />
So I guess in a sense I am not fighting pallies for aggro. In order for us to tank we have to have aggro and I think that our taunt should be up'd, plain and simple! It does not get much harder that that. Especially at lower levels and for those who are not in &quot;uber&quot; guilds. Before you get the AA's and EB weapons sometimes it just plain sucks to try and hold aggro. The provoke line is just a crutch (although a top of the line crutch). <br />
<br />
When I said no I was not fighting pallies for aggro I took it quite litteraly - No I usually do not have a pallie in my group and no I wasnt fighting one for aggro.<br />
<br />
However I think that pallies stuns aggro should be nerfed! I think it is complete and total bs that they can cast a low lvl spell that the mob is completely immune to and have that generate enough hate that in almost every situation it grabs aggro.<br />
<br />
As far as the success/fail rate on pallie taunt who cares, it is worse than ours! At least it should be (ie their lower skill lvl) and that is also part of the problem.<br />
<br />
So yeah, maybe at first glance it looks like I want pallie aggro nerfed. If you think the way it currently works even makes sense, I would like some of the drugs you are takeing! I want some &quot;reality&quot; in my fantasy game!<br />
<br />
What you are missing is the simple fact that if they lower the stun aggro and raise the success for taunts it would also effect the pallies seeing how they also have taunt? Hmmm.... ponder that!<br />
<br />
My whole point goes back to in order for us to tank the mob has to be pissed off at us and I want to be able to hold aggro just as well as a pallie can! I am quite frankly sick of hearing that if I can hold aggro that well (as good as a pallie), pallies will never get groups. Although when I think of pallies the first thing I think of as a warrior is their heals and buffs and not their tanking ability even though it is better than mine! (holding aggro is key and even if I can hold the aggro just as well as them they still have their spell book)  <br />
<br />
Before I say anymore...may I add your the one who started the thing about paladins in this thread? There was no referance to paladins WHATSOEVER until you said something about they having 100% agro. <br />
<br />
What does my referance to you wanting paladin agro nerf have to do with me taking drugs? You even seem to agree with me on that point...True however, it is complete and total bs they can generate huge amounts of aggro with simple lvl 8 and 12 spells that we can't. But unfortunatly, nerfing agro on stun resist isn't going to help that much (They still have higher level stuns which they can use to great effect, which have higher chances of landing) And also it means that weapons such has the bloodsworn and greatstaff of thunder, which are -extremely- easy and cheap to get are going to become redundant... And unless I miss my guess, medium range warriors tend to use those for agro. <br />
<br />
&quot;(holding aggro is key and even if I can hold the aggro just as well as them they still have their spell book)&quot; Okay, you can hold agro just as well as a paladin, and now you want their spellbook as well? I think, sir, that you should have ditched your warrior and rerolled it as a paladin, maybe that would make you happier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Biggwinz</div><div class="date">12-30-2003, 07:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep, I did when someone proposed up'ing our taunt ratio it was immediately shot down. I mearly suggested that I wanted the same thing that pallies had. It has been a big fuss about the difference between warrior and pallie snap aggro.<br />
<br />
My reference on the drugs was to the fact that Pallies can cast stuns on mobs that are immune to the spell and it generates aggro, and not just a little aggro but enough aggro to pull the mobs attention a huge percentage of the time! If it was not clear, sorry! I think that this is BS. If a mob is immune wtf does it care if it is hit but that spell.<br />
<br />
So... if you think that it is correct that an immune mob still gives a whoot about that spell, then you probably are on some good drugs and that was never directed at you specifically. :)<br />
<br />
At first glance it may look like I want a pallie nerf but its not true. I just want the same aggro and I want the stun bs to make sense. While I dont mind the aggro that a succesfull stun carries I think an immune stun should be nothing in the aggro department and a resisted stun a percentage of the aggro of a full stun.<br />
<br />
however... if they correct the stun screw up but actually up the successfulness of taunt (which pallies also have) it should leave the pallies where they are now and move us up to that same level!</div></div><hr />

Just because you like being Sony's bitch, wearing the handcuffs and being whipped doesn't mean the rest of the warrior community wants to.

Paladin utility hardly matters unless you're actually doing something difficult.  XP groups are not about doing difficult things, especially not the fight 1 mob for 3 hours deal that is PoP.  Paladins can do a lot of things, maybe too much, but if warriors have workable aggro (and it appears we do now) then most groups will start going back to using warriors.  When's the last time in an XP group you needed a root or a stun just to stay alive?  The 5% mitigation and the slightly more DPS (most PoP zones are not undead) a warrior brings is more tangible to a group's XP gain than the utility that rarely get used in boring XP grinds.  If you're a group grinding out in PoV pulling 1 Golem or whatever in 95% of the time, why do you need to be able to stun or root something?  It'd still be better to be able to kill something quicker, and a warrior kills something quicker than a Paladin, especially if a warrior has Tactical Mastery as that's a significant DPS advantage while tanking.  No one ever says no to more DPS, all other things being equal.<br />
<br />
Now Paladins are still useful for difficult things, like say running a hard LDoN adventure without having an enchanter or a bard, but EQ is simply not a game that's focus around doing difficult things.  Utilty is only meaningful if things go wrong, and if things don't ever go wrong (or rare enough not to matter), why wouldn't you just grab more DPS?  If you replace a DPS person with a cleric that will certainly improve your group's survivability but what's the demand for a 2nd cleric in a group?  I bet it's pretty close to 0.  Why?  Because it's safe enough with just one cleric.  If people feel it's *safe enough* with a Warrior, why would you ever want a Paladin to do easy xp grinds?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sure the warrior can migrate damage a bit better (but that is it!) but a pallie on the other hand can heal the extra damage he takes his own darn self and can heal others should crap go wrong.<br />
<br />
To top that all off he can add an extra 300 or so hps to the group, he can tank, heal, stun, hold the same aggro, and root park mobs all while wistleing the dixie!<br />

<br />
This is also about play style.  You now have snap agro.  You have or will get agro weapons.  You have a better taunt and a higher DPS.  In the LDoN/XP group arena there is now a rough parity between the two classes in desireablity that was not there before.  On raids we are better (with the sole exception of precise getting nerfed, but most of us understand the logic there) than we have ever been.  We can chain our discs to give the healers a couple of ticks to ramp up and for walled or perma rooted mobs at least, stonewall is pretty damn good.  No one will tank as well as we can on mobs like bertox, Mithy etc...and we do it better now than we ever have done before.<br />
<br />
What you seem to be advocating is the ability to so totally piss off a mob it will never look anywhere else no matter what anyone does.  That is exactly what we used to bitch at the pallies about and what will probably eventually get their low level stuns nerfed.  I actually hope they do not nerf those stuns, because they are what saves cleric, chanter and wizard butts in raids when one of them gets agro if the MT doesn't have AETaunt up.<br />
<br />
The entire point of the changes was not to make us the be-all end-all of tankage.  It was to increase our desireability to XP groups primarly to be roughly equal to paladins/SKs in the MT role in that mode.  That has already been successful.</div></div><hr />

It has already been achieved...Warriors get groups now even sometimes over a paladin, what you are proposing is seen isn't balancing, its overtipping the scale to the warriors. <br />
<br />
Paladins can heal, root and do all that utility crap, but IT IS NOT WHY THE GROUP PICKS A PALADIN, they use druids or clerics for healing, they use enchanters and bards for crowd control, heck a decently geared and experiance shaman can do all those jobs without even breaking a sweat. Sure, a paladin's abilities can augment all those just fine, but warriors can outdamage an equally geared paladin while providing decent tank coverage, effectively killing mobs faster and frankly that's what most of every group wants. To KILL mob faster. They originally chose paladins over warriors because of the solid agro they provide, so they can punch out more dps without getting creamed. With the event of incite, we can punch out a good deal of agro, more then enough to keep agro from a regular to above average group to maintain high mob killing dps rates.<br />
<br />
Thus the equality you want has been achieved, and I repeat my statement, If you want to be more twinkage to our class, please go reroll as a paladin.</div></div><hr />

From the EQ Manual....... <br />
<br />
Warriors are the masters of armed combat and defense, taking the point in battles and going head-to-head with the most dangerous creatures of Norrath. Warriors are a melee class with the ability to wear plate armor and wield all types of weapons.<br />
<br />
Warriors build their strength and stamina to unheard of levels, making them far hardier than any other class. When combined with their heavy armor and excellent defensive skills, warriors are unmatched in their ability to survive the most brutal battles. Warriors train themselves in the skills of combat, mastering the use of all weapons and tactics. <br />
<br />
Warriors also learn to taunt their opponents, making themselves the focus of all their enemies' attacks, allowing the less resilient members of their group to remain safe from harm.<br />
<br />
Warriors are often the cornerstone of a good group, providing a strong defense while also dealing heavy damage to their enemies. Warriors fare poorly when adventuring alone, and are an excellent choice for those who enjoy grouping and taking the front line in battle.<br />

 No I am advocateing for THE EXACT SAME SNAP AGGRO AS PALLIES, F is this that hard to comprehend???? Why in the F should I have to group with a Pallie to save the cleric, chanter or wiz???<br />
<br />
And sure I may have good aggro at my level, but if crap goes wrong, we have a bad multi pull, people are getting there butt kicked, I just used AE taunt, my weapon already proc'd and incite is working on one mob, I am left with what, at max a 60% chance for taunt to work?<br />
<br />
A pallie in the same situation has long since ago already got every single mob in the area pissed off at him a long time ago.<br />
<br />
Then to top this all off, wtf happens in the same situation with a level 55 warrior without AA's??? Damn straight a lvl 55 pallie could handle it!<br />

But I guess you are right, pallies should be the best tanks and have a spell book and be able to heal and i should just STFU... what ever!<br />

SOE gave us a great gift on the 18th, how about appreciating it for a while before begging for more?<br />

Hey don't get me wrong. I appreciate the new CA's that's been implemented. Before with taunt button mashing fails, the casters I was trying to protect would have been turned to 10lb Halas meat pies before it turned on me.<br />
<br />
Now at least I have a lot better chance of reducing aggro against them and rolling it on my fuzzy rear.<br />
<br />
And as for a 51 (this date) .... I think I'm pretty darn good at snagging aggro for the weapons/equipment/play style I'm using.<br />
<br />
Class does not make the player ... the player makes the class.<br />

We need to dumb down the game even more for these people. How can we expect them to compete when they have no skill already?  That's right, just make the game easier.  No skill?  No problem!  We got graveyards right here for ya.  Having problems keeping mobs off the casters?  Here's an aggro lock!<br />
<br />
Man, some of you people wouldn't have lasted 5 minutes in EQ 4 years ago.  Corpse runs from Qeynos to SK with no invis and no sow would have killed you.  That which doesn't kill you, only makes you stronger tho, and it's really easy to see who was around back in the day and who's new to this game.  The taunt system for warriors is currently fine.  We don't need 100% taunt, we don't need an aggro lock, we don't need shit.  Learn how to use the tools you have, they are incredibly powerful now.  With the taunt failure message, you can lock down aggro with a little coordination with your shaman or enchanter in seconds flat if you just thought about it for 5 fucking seconds instead of complaining about how you're still inferior.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have several toons 65 of several different classes. I know how to play and I know how to watch/hold/take aggro. I just think taunt needs to be adjusted! Plain and simple!<br />
<br />
And no I am not the dr00d that quaded all day long for exp, I level'd all of my toons in dungeons.<br />
<br />
I lead one heck of a group, I just want the same stupid life saving aggro that pallies have!<br />
<br />
But this is a game and to many people freak out when they die and nothing sucks more than knowing that if could just have grabbed that mobs attention 1 second sooner they would not have died!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Incite on incoming.... Snap<br />
<br />
Why in the F should I have to group with a Pallie to save the cleric, chanter or wiz???<br />
<br />
<br />
You ummmm.... dont.<br />
<br />
And sure I may have good aggro at my level, but if crap goes wrong, we have a bad multi pull, people are getting there butt kicked, I just used AE taunt, my weapon already proc'd and incite is working on one mob, I am left with what, at max a 60% chance for taunt to work?<br />
<br />
You wipe.<br />
This is what makes the game fun.<br />
Heaven forbid we never die.<br />
Crap goes wrong for a reason.<br />
Even for Pallies whom ye seem to think are immortal for some reason.<br />
<br />
Just as everything went wrong for that warrior in that description, a pally can have bad luck too.<br />
<br />
But both ye average warrior and pally can handle a bad pull..<br />
Its kinda easy.<br />
<br />
A pallie in the same situation has long since ago already got every single mob in the area pissed off at him a long time ago.<br />
<br />
A warrior that didnt have all that bad luck you just piled on him would also own that situation.<br />
<br />
Then to top this all off, wtf happens in the same situation with a level 55 warrior without AA's??? Damn straight a lvl 55 pallie could handle it!<br />
<br />
The warrior handles it?<br />
<br />
But I guess you are right, pallies should be the best tanks and have a spell book and be able to heal and i should just STFU... what ever!<br />
<br />

YOU are the one saying pallies are superior.</div></div><hr />

As a pallie at lvl 55 they still have their snap aggro! They are going to live.<br />
<br />
You ummmm.... dont.In reference to grouping with a pally to save the cleric.... that you previously said...<br />
I actually hope they do not nerf those stuns, because they are what saves cleric, chanter and wizard butts in raids when one of them gets agro if the MT doesn't have AETaunt up. So which is it you do or dont have to have stuns to save the cleric...<br />
<br />
YOU are the one saying pallies are superior. Duh, I have said it over and over and over Pallies have supperior snap aggro! That has kinda been what this whole thread is about!</div></div><hr />

<br />
This gives me the fast quick and easy snap aggro that SK's and pallies. have.<br />

To get this, buy the tome from the guy in EC Tunnel.<br />
Hand it to your guild trainer.<br />
Zone.<br />
Press ALT+C and a CA window appears. Right click on one of the empty squares and follow the menu.<br />
Look for the one that says &quot;Incite&quot;<br />

Select it.<br />
<br />
Now when the puller brings in the mob make SURE! And this is VERY important, make SURE you have the mob targeted and press the button.<br />
The one that says &quot;Incite&quot;.<br />
<br />
You now have snap aggro like all other tanks.<br />
<br />
As for why we dont get the exacvt same type?<br />
THey have this thing called &quot;Stun&quot;hich works different than our snap aggro.<br />
<br />
See pallies have a bunch of useless crap that no one cares anything about except one thing....aggro.<br />
<br />
If we get the same caliber of aggro as a pally, they are out of a job.<br />
<br />
They will be sitting there LFG with all thier roots, stuns, heals, buffs etc etc because they have crap DPS and the same aggro as warriors.<br />
<br />
This is why so many pallies are wanting to nerf warriors.<br />
We are arguably the superior tank now.</div></div><hr />

This thread is not about when things go great it is about when things go to crap... which would you rather have a warrior or pallie who can pull it off of you (unless you have low hp aggro to top of the aggro list)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raivene</div><div class="date">12-31-2003, 03:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Before the patch except for AETaunt we had ZERO snap agro.  We had no ranged agro except a bow, and all of our agro was at the mercy of the RNG.<br />
<br />
After the patch we have respectable ranged on command agro generation.<br />
<br />
Pallies get, as we all know, incredable on command agro at range.  To pay for that ability they take more damage than we do and do less damage (Undead not withstanding).<br />
<br />
Yes, when a pull goes bad we have to work harder than a pally does to pull it off the cleric (more than likely in an XP group it's the overnuking dont' give a damn about agro wizard that pulled the agro though), that's part of the give and take of what classes can do.  (see prior posts ref:  agro control is everyones job)  We're better at some things...they are better at others.<br />
<br />
The entire purpose of the changes was to increase XP group desireablity of pure melee.  That was accomplished quite successfully at least as far as Warriors are concerned (monks still have a ways to go).  It wasn't intended to make a warrior chosen over a pally 100% of the time.  It was intended to make them equally chosen.  If you received the same snap agro abilities as a paladin then you are the preferred tank in all situations and paladins will have a legitimate bitch that they just got sent back to kunark.<br />
<br />
If you are a pally and you want to do warrior damage and mitigate like a warrior reroll a warrior.<br />
<br />
If you are a warrior and want the agro abilities of a paladin...go reroll a pally.<br />
<br />
The classes are different for a reason and have differing strengths and weaknesses.<br />
<br />
The bottom line is YES it is too much to ask to have the snap agro (and accompaning agro LOCK that would come with it) of a paladin.  That wasn't what we asked for ... the improvements we have received have helped us a lot.  Be thankful for what we did get, it is better than most of us expected by a long shot.  Asking for the moon just makes us as a community look ungrateful as hell.</div></div><hr />

When things go to crap, the pallie dies.<br />
<br />
Sorry.<br />
Im not buying into your &quot;Pallies are God&quot; theory.<br />
You wont get too much sympathy from me.<br />
<br />
If you cant tank, learn.<br />
If you cant handle a Murphy's Law situation, that is YOUR problem<br />
Not the warrior classes.Dont feel for me, I am well aware that warriors are superior.<br />
I am confident I can handle a bad pull.<br />
<br />
Pallies may bring it to the group, but their not healing, their not mezzing, their not doing all of the stuff they can do.<br />
They are stunning mobs because the puller knows what he is doing, if there is a bad pull, the CC knows what they are doing, if the CC sucks, and your pally fizzles, has his roots break, mistargets, hes dead too.<br />
<br />
Just cause you think a pally can handle 70 adds, leap tall buildings in a single bound, tank 9 dragons buy using stuns to mitigate damage, can make all mobs undead so they can do awesome damage, chain group CH a raid etc etc does not mean the rest of us are so easily impressed.</div></div><hr />

Here is your golden star for creativity! <br />

When it boils down to a bad situation and the exact same group. If you sub out the warrior for the pallie 9 times out of 10 the pallie group is going to come out ahead of the warrior group!</div></div><hr />

You did NOT say this.<br />
It is a perception I got from your posts.<br />
Which.. I still have.<br />
<br />
Pallies are better at snap aggro than warriors. I just want the same! <br />
<br />
Snap aggro is identical.<br />
Amount of aggro is different.<br />
Pallies need something to make themself appealing as a tank.<br />
Aggro is it.<br />
<br />
Yet no one has yet to come up with a valid reason why this should not be! edit - or should I say tried to give a decent explanation of one, one that could be discussed<br />
<br />
This is your opinion.<br />
It is not debatable.<br />
Keep in mind it is my opinion that they are decent and your reasoning is inadequite.<br />
<br />
Why wouldnt a pallie heal?<br />
<br />
Cause hes tanking and the healer is healing.<br />
<br />
Why wouldnt a pallie park adds on a bad pull?<br />
<br />
Cause hes tanking while others handle CC<br />
<br />
I mean seriously wtf kind of pallies do you group with.<br />
<br />
Ones that tank, lock up the aggro, and get me good XP<br />
<br />
<br />
I have been in groups where the cleric was busy beating the crap out of the mob because the pallie was able to be the main healer! I have even been in groups with out any healing besides the pallies.<br />
<br />
You did not have to accept these groups.<br />
No one twisted your arm.<br />
<br />
When it boils down to a bad situation and the exact same group.<br />
Both a pally or a warrior who knows what they are doing will do fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Biggwinz</div><div class="date">12-31-2003, 04:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow, nice post! I was amazed with the total ammount of reasoning and total debate in there!<br />
<br />
First let me say that the no cleric groups actually faired quite well in the exp department. Your logic that if a low DPS Pallie is healing he isnt tanking and rolling in the EXP just amazes me!<br />
<br />
Pallies need something to make themself appealing as a tank.<br />
Aggro is it. Once again I /boggle at your total ability to sum up a well rounded class with just one of their abilities! /boggle!<br />
<br />
Cause hes tanking and the healer is healing. Heaven forbid the healer needs healing!<br />
<br />
It is a perception I got from your posts. Well let me expalin it to you very slowly... I do not think pallies are Gods or I would have rolled one up myself! I think they are a well rounded class and that actually have it pretty good.  <br />
<br />
On the other hand I think my warrior got left behind in the dust the last few expansions. This has been addressed to some extent via our provoke line. How ever I fail to see how up'ing our snap aggro will be so detrimental to the well rounded pallie class, that you so gracefully sum up as only wanted for aggro!<br />
<br />
Here, why dont you explain to me the huge difference between our AC, Defensive, and HP status. This might clear something up for me. While I do know about our migration difference someone forgot to point out the huge differences in AC, defense and HP's! Which is a pretty large make up of the tank classes of which the Warrior is suppose to be the basis that the hybrids stem from!</div></div><hr />

And Varalla, if you honestly think the only thing a paladin brings to a group is aggro, then you have been grouping with some seriously lazy paladins.  I hate to break it to you, but pallys are still pretty damned godlike in xp groups right now, particularly in ldon, which is full to brimming over with undead.  <br />
Can we do our jobs now? Absolutely.  Incite in tandem with the other tools we have at our disposal makes us do our job adequately.  Can pallys do it too, and do all the other myriad of things that their spellbook allows them to do? Yes they can, and then some.  <br />
I have to agree with Haass, the game has been dumbed down enough already, giving warriors any more aggro would just add to that. Knights chaincasting level 9 spells on mobs that are immune to them and in doing so maintaining aggro lock is just another way the game has been dumbed down. It's an exploit, and it needs to be fixed.  If that is done, we actually WILL be evenly balanced with them.  <br />
(And you guys are correct, in the ideal group where the content you're fighting isn't even close to a challenge, the paladin and warrior are pretty evenly balanced now, but as things are right now, groups can still push the envelope a lot harder with a paladin tanking than they can with a warrior, and if they're made to use level appropriate spells with level appropriate mana costs to lock aggro this will still be true, but it will actually have a cost associated with it and not just be an endless well of aggro and utility.)</div></div><hr />

For those who don't know what I mean... 2 mobs INC, I tank both for a few while he picks one and &lt;CEASE&gt;,&lt;DESIST&gt;, lead it away, and &lt;ROOT&gt; is the extent of the crowd control we bring to typical LDONS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not arguing that warriors should have &quot;better&quot; taunt than they do now.  I'm arguing that warriors should have a different *kind* of taunt than they do now.<br />
<br />
Specifically: there are two different concepts of the Taunt skill in the world; the standard normal six-second-refresh-60-percent-success Taunt skill, and AETaunt.   One always works, but has a painfully long refresh timer; the other only sometimes works, but refreshes quickly.<br />
<br />
Let's take the normal Taunt skill, and make it a bit more extreme.  Give it a one-second refresh timer, but let it succeed only 10% of the time.   What's the outcome?<br />
<br />
Button-mashing.  People hitting the Taunt key frantically every single time it comes up.<br />
<br />
Now, let's move the normal Taunt skill closer to the AETaunt end of things.  Give it a 12-second refresh and an 80% success rate.  What's the outcome?<br />
<br />
Button-mashing is even less optimal than it is now, but people who carefully ration and time their use of the Taunt skill are more successful than they are currently.<br />

I'm just saying that I prefer skill-based games to luck-based games.  I'd rather have a Taunt skill that refreshed less often, and was more successful, not because it would make warriors &quot;more powerful&quot;, or give us &quot;aggro lock&quot;...but because it would reward careful, thoughtful, skillful play more than button-mashing.<br />
<br />
Anyone care to address the question from this perspective?<br />

Thanks much,<br />

<br />
I feel the higher your skill, the more successful Taunt should be. <br />

Idiot Druid kiting existed by March/April 99....I imagine it existed in beta.  I remember doding the bastages.</div></div><hr />

Give it a 12-second refresh and an 80% success rate. What's the outcome?<br />
<br />
Button-mashing is even less optimal than it is now, but people who carefully ration and time their use of the Taunt skill are more successful than they are currently.<br />
 <br />
<br />
The problem with this is that it would create problems when more than one person pulls agro off you within the refresh time.   Classic exaple...Enchanter gets agro, I taunt, regain agro, but at same time rager snares(either to grab agro of the chanter, or simply to snare), mob now goes over to ranger and I am waiting for taunt refresh.  Another example would be in those situations where casters run, and pull the mob out of taunt range as I push the button(I admit, they kinda deserve to die anyway...I hate running casters).  Taunt still greys out till refresh, and I am screwed.  I admit these situations do noit happen alot, but often enough where I would be leary of increasing taunt refresh, even for more likelyness of success.</div></div><hr />

For the record, paladin dont have &quot;aggro lock&quot; as way too many people believe we do. <br />
<br />
Its easily testable with warrior + paladin.  Warrior with some aggro proc weapon (can be whatever really) with or without (anger 3 for this test) and paladin with 2 stuns + div stun.<br />
<br />
Both keep meleeing, paladin stuns whenever they pop.<br />
<br />
Warrior will hold aggro a majority of the time (we used Vanazir + 150 ruj dd for me and bow + a3 on the warrior) and in some cases, the paladin is unable to hold aggro at all if the warrior doesnt forget positioning.<br />
<br />
  <br />
<br />
Quite frankly, I'll very strongly disagree with you.  A chain stunning pally losing agro to a warrior through normal melee?  I very seriously doubt this would happen other than possibly in a very very tiny, miniscule number of cases.  <br />
<br />
I was in a PoV guild group a while back, and in the group was a 65 pally.  She had cease and desist up, as well as FoA.  On 1 particular inc, my BoC procced on the first attack round, as I picked off the mob from the puller.  And it kept proccing, had a very lucky streak.  Before the crystalline golem was even at 70 percent, the BoC had gone off five (5) times, as well as 1 proc out of my epic.  I figured this mob was as locked on me as any mob I'll ever have.  So, I asked the pally to see if she could pull agro from me.  It took her 2 casts, FoA once and one of her low level stuns.  The mob was then on her for the rest of the fight *was on her longer than it was on me*  It even held on her through another BoC proc.<br />
<br />
While I can definitely see a warrior pulling agro over a pally who's just meleeing, I really can't see it happening over a pally who's chain stunning.</div></div><hr />

Well, we're not pallies.<br />
<br />
I don't have an issue with pallies having better aggro than we do... as long as ours is good enough to do our job.<br />
<br />
Recent changes (addtional procs via ldon augments and incite) have made it so we have good aggro control.<br />
<br />
We really lose a lot of credibility as a community if we continue to ask for the moon and the stars after the real problem has been fixed.  (no we lose credibility when people just settle for the mindless bullshit SOE shoves down our throat, because they are too afraid of &quot;nerfing&quot; toons that exploit spells.)<br />

Playing a 65 warrior in Elemental Planes i can tell you Provoke (incite) line of spells ( errr skills) are not on the same playing field of our hybrid tanks.  Sure it is better then the POS (now that you know your failure rate, and wonder how the hell we ever did hold any aggro) taunt that we had, but its a far cry from the ability that hybrids have.  Any one that cries that warriors have the hps and ac that hybrids will never see, is still back in Velious trying to figure out where thurgadin is, and still whining that they were left behind for years from kunark to the release of Velious, 6 months later. <br />
<br />
Disc skills being the make or break between the tanks, is nothing but a feeble attempt to cover all the spells/skills that they bring to the table.<br />
<br />
Its totally level for warriors to have the &quot;chump&quot; 150hps over the same geared hybrid, or to have a &quot;slightly&quot; improved /disc (that quite frankly got nerfed when attached to Endurance.  If your timer is not up, you can not use it, if your endurance is gone, you can not use it... Fubar'ed X2, cong, to those mighty strike/furious  freaks for burning your endurance up to be all that dps that hybrids so envy.)  While they have group beneficial spells, that no matter how much they tell you they are worthless, use everytime they group.<br />
<br />
<br />
What really pisses me off, is now i play an arcade game.  I still dont have the aggro that my lessor tanks do (whether snap or permanent aggro is your shtick).  With the introduction of Endurance, i feel more like a hybrid then i do when i am meleeing with my cleric.<br />
<br />
If incite was to be the fix that everyone braggs about, then why wasnt Taunt simply taken out, or ,,,,, OR,,, why wasnt taunt inverted into being the provoke line...   The taunt we got now is a fuckin joke.  Dont believe me?  There are threads among threads about &quot;how many failures in a row&quot; all over the boards.  Something must be working as intended.  <br />
<br />
Too many people bought into the provoke shit, because it is better then what we had.  But its not as good as it should have been.  An i am insulted that they and many people are content with it.</div></div><hr />

if you sit there mashing the Taunt button every time it comes up, it won't be there when you need it, and you'll be unable to get aggro back. ... It rewards skillful play, while penalizing button-mashers.<br />
<br />
I'm not certain I buy in to the premise of your argument.  That being, there are times when if you don't have the Taunt key up and ready to stab, someone will die.<br />
<br />
This hasn't been my experience in the main, and I prefer to keep escalating hate constantly during a melee by using Taunt when it is available.<br />
<br />
There have, rarely, been times when I would have loved to be sure Taunt was there at a specific moment.<br />
<br />
In those cases though, I with utmost skillfulness and prowess utilized my &quot;Shield&quot; ability until Taunt popped.  I think Shield is the mark of the truly skillful Warrior.<br />
<br />
The new Provoke line of disciplines gives me the best of both worlds.<br />
<br />
I can use Taunt to continuously elevate hate, and have Provoke popped and ready to help me in the rare instances such a move is necessary.<br />
<br />
I find Provoke very helpful when breaking mez, particularly Necro mez which may have been cast two or more times on the same mob.<br />
<br />
It is also quite nice in diverting aggro away from a puller on the inbound.<br />
<br />
Altogether, I think things are pretty good.  I am reserving final judgement until all the melee disciplines are live, and can be evaluated in totality.<br />
<br />
I believe any criticism is premature at this point.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why should the opinions of others insult you?  Methinks you take this game far too seriously.<br />
<br />
Here's a pointer I learned very early on for keeping aggro away from hybrids, and compensating for their ability to cast.<br />
<br />
One word: potions<br />
<br />
Talk to yer favorite Shammy.  Ask for something called Kilva's Blistering Flesh.<br />
<br />
Good luck to ya.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just a note, but taunt does not work that way.  Taunt when successfull puts you on top of the hate list.  If you are already there, it adds for all purposes no hate(a negligable amount).  Therefore it is better to save taunt for when you have lost agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 09:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">big thread and lots of stuff I would have liked to respond to if I had read it when it was current, but one thing that seemed to be a bit of an issue early on was the situation of when things go pear shaped a paladin has the tools to save the group and a warrior doesn't.<br />
<br />
So paladins have some utility that would save a group where you can't on those occasions where AET is down and the chanter is getting beat on etc.  Well personally I very rarely need to use AET, I save it as an emergency tool for when things really go to shit, and if you are having those kinda of moments more than once every 15mins then your lack of utility as a tank is not the problem.  If the group is consistently getting into situations where the tank is required to CC or to step up and heal then your group sucks, really.<br />
<br />
On the otherhand, if you do have AET up and a bad pull comes in with 3+ mobs whats a paladin or SK  going to do that can compare with popping Fortitude/Furious along with AET and giving your group 12 secs to get its shit together.  Or just pop AET and Defensive and tank 3 mobs each of which would be a challenge for a pally to tank individually, and you shouldnt need to be able to hold agro on all 3 for the duration of the fight, just for long enough for the slower / CC etc to get them under control.<br />
<br />
There was also the situation earlier of who to choose between a LFG warrior or pally and it being a 50/50 choice?  Well I think we are at the point now where both classes bring enough to the table to be viable choices and are different enough that your particular situation will make one or the other preferable - which in my opinion is how it should be.<br />
<br />
- Druid main healer? get a pally for back up heals and extra buffs.  <br />
- Camping BoT at upper sands or upper water / some other camp with a hard hitting named? get a warrior for defensive and better tanking.<br />
<br />
If one tanking class is superior in all aspects of tanking then other tanking classes wont get groups unless there are none of the primary tank classes available.  This was the situation the LFG warrior crowd was in for pretty much the last 12 months - any pallys LFG? may aswell play an alt.  At its extreme groups will sit about with no tank waiting for the ideal class rather than taking a secondary tank class for their group.  This was often the situation back when I started playing (early velious) and what people associate with the K-word.  <br />
<br />
Both warriors and knights have had their share of bad times and I don't wish that on anyone.  <br />
<br />
Now both classes have different strengths and most importantly warrior agro control is no longer a liability to a group.  Warriors won't get every tanking spot and its a pretty even call as to who you take when you see same level similarly geared / AA'd tanks LFG (these days alot of groups seem to be quite happy to take both if they have room) but the main thing is now when you see 65/100aa warrior LFG and 62/3aa pally LFG you'd take the warrior without question.  6 months ago alot of players would have taken the pally.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I do it all the time... Mind you my gear is NOT the &quot;average&quot; warriors gear.  That being said Im not real sure what the problem is here.  If a group WANTS to get a paladin for a MT they will no matter what changes are implemented.  That simply is not going to change.  Its much more what the leader of x-group thinks than about whether a paladin can aggro lock/get aggro effectively.  We could get a taunt that was had a 10% fail rate with an instant refresh and you know what.... Some people would STILL want a paladin to MT in a group...  No improvements to taunt no matter how radical will change that.  <br />
<br />
And if you want to know the truth... Purely in the sense of aggro generation there are other classes out there who can generate OBSCENE amounts of aggro.  If I want to test how good my aggro is I dont fight a paladin for taunt.  I shoot a tell to one of the guild necro's to see whether they are DoT stacking :) <br />
<br />
Sure paladins can get snap aggro bleh bleh... And frankly when Im grouped with a paladin and they start pulling crap like that is when I get out the ole 2hander and go DPS~  No paladin worth a damn will WANT to tank over warrior...  The exception here in my mind is if the paladin's gear is significantly better than the warriors... In which case why wouldnt you let the paladin tank?.. If they have 1khp and 200 more ac than your just being silly by insisting that you MUST tank.  <br />
<br />
The ONLY change they need to make to taunt is to decrease the fail rate on the skill check just a LITTLE.  The issue, to me, isnt that paladin's can get aggro quick (I like that) its that taunt fails so damn much with max skill + modifiers.  A better than 50% fail rate on ANY other classes skill would send them clamoring to SoE to fix it.  What is really needed is a bracket system that the skill checks against (eg. if mob &lt; half player level than +100% skill... if mob &lt; 3/4 player level than +85% skill.... If mob = or &gt; than +/- 10 levels of PC than +50% skill. or something like that... need more coffee heh)  In other words... A &quot;resistance&quot; or &quot;intimidation&quot; check based on level difference to the PC much like was implemented for spell resistances.  Except maybe with better coding so that a_moss_snake01 doesnt &quot;resist&quot; a taunt from a 65 warrior heh.</div></div><hr />
