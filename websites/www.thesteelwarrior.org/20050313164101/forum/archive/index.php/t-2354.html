<br />
Just heard from someone on test that Ifir is upgraded to 18/19 from 17/19 +1 fire.  The change isn't in Lucy yet however and I didn't get a link.<br />
<br />
This could be the first round of melee balancing, upgrading common PoP weapons.  Though not sure how much of an upgrade it is keeping the effective damage the same.  Will need to ask my gf for some melee parsing from xp in fire compared to xp in earth over the course of a few hours to see the real difference.<br />
<br />
Anyway, the real question is, are there any other weapons out there ugpraded?  What does the BoW look like now? SEWS? AoE?  Reinforced Mephit Talon?  Sword of Primordial Power?  Hammer of Crushing Waves?  Anything else I'm missing?</div></div><hr />

<br />
They might as well start with the weapon that will gain a HUGE<br />
benefit from that +1dmg.</div></div><hr />

i hope they add higher damage bonus to 2handers below 28 dly :D  <br />
<br />
I don't think the melee problem is with 2handers per se. I think the entire melee situation, however, is so screwed up that they don't have a damn clue how to fix it.<br />
<br />
The first thing that needs to be fixed, if anything, is the now anemic DW scenario for those classes that can DW. Right now DPS with even the TOP TOP DW setups still cannot touch the top 2h setups. What exactly is the benefit of DW again? Right... nothing. We have had so much 'overcorrection' for past imbalances that DW is now in the same place that 2h was before SoL, pre-2H D/Dly 'fix.' <br />
<br />
They need an updated combat simulator that will allow them to punch up numbers on weaponry, taking in maximized AA, ATK, and now 'Time mod' setups, versus both the FRONT and BACK of a mob based on a per class basis and build/rebuild the weapons database. After 5 years they still do not understand Rogue DPS. They still do not understand the DB. They still do not understand tank DPS. They still do not understand melee. Period.<br />
<br />
However, to add insult to injury to this whole thing in regards to 2Handers, rumor has it they are even nerfing the already not so great and extremely rare Vanazir to 60/40. Thus, my DPS and ability to do my job with a Vanazir will fall even further below that of using a weapon off a Tier 3 mob (RZTW - Blade of War). Tell me again what my weapon choices are?<br />
<br />
Right, they flat out suck. We already give up nearly everything as a class to Knights in the Plane of Time, now with them adding the missing Knight 2hander in the Plane of Time to Phase 5, that gap will be even greater.<br />
<br />
Can somebody step up once and for all and put a stop to this nonsense and give Warriors a break? And to a lesser degree all pure melee?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stikka</div><div class="date">08-05-2003, 11:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Speaking as a Rogue with an Ifir replacing +1 fire with 1 to base damage will be handy. In PoFire for instance it is always resisted fully and in most other places the +1 fire is resisted about 50% of the time.<br />
<br />
Difference in non crit max backstabs is 704 - 744. 744 happens when the +1 fire lands so will see the end of the 704 range.<br />
<br />
Doubt it will effect Warriors overly much as I can't see many at the Fennin level even considering a 1h piercer like Ifir when it comes to looting.<br />
<br />
As Furor pointed out Dual Wielding is a dead dog compared to a decent 2h so the only classes who really bother DW'ing are those with no 2h option (Rogues and Bards) Bards however don't use their weapons all that much relatively leaving only rogues. I suspect they may play with backstab options and call Dual Wield DPS &quot;fixed&quot; which it plainly won't be.<br />
<br />
If it is implemented it is not earth shatteringly wonderful, but it's definately not a bad thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Surlok</div><div class="date">08-05-2003, 12:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How much of a difference,In overall DPS, would allowing Damage bonus to effect offhand as well in a dual wield setup.<br />
<br />
Include Ambi and CF AA,One could even go so far as to allow flurry to fire in the offhand as well.<br />
<br />
I imagine it would put all three pure melee classes Dual wield on Par with 2 handers,likely even more.Allowing Flurry and assuming the warrior has both Luclin and PoP Flurry AA would surely put them quite a stretch above 2 handers.<br />
<br />
This would effect Rangers,Bards,and beastlords as well though I assume,as I doubt they can code that to just involve Monks/rogues/Wars.<br />
<br />
Would people be to upset that Rangers/Bards/Beastlords got a boost if they went that road?<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: Forgot to include Bards as a Dual wield class,So easy to forget about them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">08-05-2003, 04:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the advantage to DW is that you get a better looking Magelo profile.  Why anyone would take 200 HP over a lot more DPS is beyond me though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NinjaBurger</div><div class="date">08-05-2003, 06:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">People DW now for stats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">08-05-2003, 08:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">DW is dead in the BoW+ game for sure. However, before you can get a BoW DW is alive and well. You cant beat dual EB or for the less uber dual stun weapons for agro. Very few preBoW 2h weapons can hold agro as well as a good DW combo.<br />
<br />
I do agree though, something needs to be done to help DW. The difference in DPS is way too much to make DW a viable option except in cases where tons of agro is necessary. Most of the time, the agro of a good 2h weapon is plenty.</div></div><hr />
