<br />
XP=Crap<br />
<br />
No matter where I go, how fast I pull, etc. I'm stuck 5% into 66, and im starting to get depressed. is 66 a hell level or am i killing in the wrong places? I want 70 for the additional hp/mitigation gains but the other night i got sick of my bar never moving and switched to aa again :\<br />
<br />
Where should a group of pre-vt pre-ep's (mostly ornate and ldon stuff) go to get the best xp? i hate the xp grind more than any fucking thing in this game, and i can't wait to be done with it... yet again :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
I did a mixture of WoS, MPG, and RCoD.  I did one hard LDON but it was horrible xp.<br />
<br />
I would honestly suggest getting a group together and doing one of the instanced zones off of DS (Dranik's Scar).  The xp is good there and it's not too terribly hard.  Sort of like a medium LDON.  Can get some nameds there as well.<br />
<br />
Xping in pre-OoW zones won't get you very far, neither will LDoNs.  Fire and Earth are ok XP but if you can't get there I honestly wouldn't bother with PoP and LDoN.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Stay away from all instanced zones (they all suck).<br />
To be honest you have (mostly) 2 choises :<br />
<br />
WoS = Retard Festival Karnor &amp; KS Fest ......<br />
If you choose WoS , go near MPG entrance (to the left side) its usually quiet there,<br />
without roamers, trains, KS, but no named i recall.<br />
If MPG entrance left side is a bit too hard, try Left side again, near the &quot;wall&quot; around<br />
the &quot;Stargate&quot; spot, should be really quiet there &amp; problem free.<br />
<br />
RCoD = Lag Fest<br />
99% of EQ players have some insane lag rate in RCoD (remember WL ? well its worse)<br />
there are a couple of nice safe spots (GO INDOOR asap) and the xp there isnt too bad<br />
(not as good as WoS), i havent been often in RCoD, but you could camp near the<br />
sewers / catacombs expedition entrance.<br />
Another nice spot is if you have the map, below Zum Malasomething room,<br />
There should be 2 or 3 circular rooms, one with a big red girplan.<br />
The corridor connecting these 2-3 rooms is 100% Safe.<br />
(There are however 5-8 Kyv roamers nearby so carefull, druid epic prep spot well call it).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">11-03-2004, 02:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mmmm the good old  Lvl vs AA thing.<br />
<br />
I do agree with most people that say LVL &gt;&gt; AA, however it is to my eyes<br />
rather stupid to try and rush to lvl70 without having the proper &quot;package&quot;.<br />
<br />
Kinda like &quot;look ! im 70 ! i have zero AA and still wear crustacean ! but i'm 70 !&quot;<br />
<br />
My advice : CA3 CS3 LR5 ID5 then go for lvl70.<br />
<br />
Lvl70 for me is designed for people with lvl60 &amp; lvl65 AAs (specially tanks).<br />
Maybe a lvl70 with no def AA tanks better than a 66 full AA, there were many<br />
posts about that, specially when OOW came out.<br />
<br />
But i see &quot;basic&quot; AA set as a very important part of a character.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vilicontus</div><div class="date">11-03-2004, 03:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeaps, get your pre-OOW defensive AAs done before you leave 65. Even with my current  setup it can be pretty rough against the exp mobs.<br />
<br />
Remember, as you go higher up in level, the mobs that you can decently exp off (dark blue and above) get lesser, since some zones which were previously dark blue to you, are now light blue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">czai</div><div class="date">11-03-2004, 03:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks. another thing, should i go ahaid and burn through some aa's and finish CS/CS/ID/LR? or should i go ahaid and make the grind to 70? i'm thinking i may be a bit more GoD/OoW worthy with the additional mitigation due to my low ac.<br />
<br />
IMO it sorta depends on if you have friends to group with regularly.  If you do, I'd grind out some AA's.  If you find yourself LFG a lot, getting a few more levels might help you get groups faster.<br />
<br />
As for xp rate, I'd say roughly:<br />
<br />
MPG &gt; DS expedition (level 70 adv) &gt; WoS &gt; RCoD.  Haven't been to RSS yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azaza</div><div class="date">11-03-2004, 03:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">BoT aint that great but was bearable for me at 66, if you're in a 'liesurely' grind mood. Bloodfields is comparable if ya insist on OoW.<br />
<br />
Noble's Causeway and Harbingers aint super, but can be nice and steady if you're in a duo or trio, upto 68. Named in both makes things interesting.<br />
<br />
RCoD is hella good into 68, but highly recommend a good cleric/group and defensive aa's as mobs can be nasty. Anything more than a single pull is having a deathwish imo (unless you have solid CC)<br />
<br />
WoS.... /groan. Hella good exp, but the learning curve on aggro radius, pathing, etc can be very steep with pickup group fiascos. Rezzer in group is mandatory imo. Someone's gonna die at some point, the sooner you rez, the sooner the exp flows again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Vxed xp is still decent at level 70, even better with a chanter pet.  Spent some time there helping people with epics, it's ~3% aa per kill at 70.</div></div><hr />

(Unless it got tuned down, didnt notice any diff from Vxed 1.0 during my epic run).<br />
<br />
Ench+Pet is a different thing totally agre (if you can get the pet to tank).<br />
And yeah Vxed+Tipt xp is really nice (i remember it from the Pooooooka camping)<br />
<br />
Check his magelo Darkgecko :) <br />
I doubt he can do vxed to &quot;level and AA&quot; with his current setting.</div></div><hr />

But, you have the potential to upgrade a lot of slots between 66 and 70.  With that in mind, I would experience in Omens exclusively.  Lots of plusses to it.<br />
<br />
1. Get your loyalist faction up as you level.  Know what drops you need for the quest armor and collect em as you can.<br />
<br />
2. Some very solid upgrades from trash mobs. Blue Flame Neck and Nimble Shoulders from WoS are good examples.<br />
<br />
3. Decent cash loots from mobs while exp'ing.<br />
<br />
4. Runes for cash (or to get groupmates their spells if you have a regular group).<br />
<br />
5. Some good drops that will upgrade you come from the same mobs you gotta kill to get your Quest pieces. Terror Chain Ring and Bygone Butchers Cleaver for example.<br />
<br />
6. Everyone seems to be in Omens now so easier to find groups.<br />
<br />
Anyway, thats my plug for staying in Omens to level.  It sure seems slow I know, but it will happen, hehe.</div></div><hr />

With the relatively easy named camps/drops and good steady exp you can really rake in some cash and get your levels.</div></div><hr />

I like the hill camp better than NW caves; same exp per mob for the most part, but many more nameds. I'd consider wos hill about even with most of MPG; mpg usually has better exp per kill but also slower kills due to too many people for too few mobs. WoS south of the wall is terrible exp and a total crapshoot when it comes to nameds. Draniks Hollows instances arent bad; I can 2box with an undergeared shambot and get decent aa while waiting for a real group. NC is the same way. I have yet to exp in rcod or bloodfields, so ymmv</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Groovdog</div><div class="date">11-03-2004, 01:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">DH instances (off DS) are good xp at 66 IF you get a 68 instance. RCoD instances are good for xp (like sewers better than cats) through 68 (with 68 instance). All xp sucks if you break the 5 level xp bonus barrier. At 70 you need 68+ instanced content or RCoD+ to have any hope.<br />
<br />
Good AA crankspot is at level 68 (I parked for 75+AA at this level) in the instanced 68+ content in RCoD. Mobs are 4-5% AAXP and relatively easy assuming you can get singles/doubles. DH instance at that level are 3-4% non-named as well. An AA every 45 mins is easy if u have decent equip and pull fast.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">11-03-2004, 06:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">NC is not bad till 67ish.  Nice, fun, mellow zone, easy mobs, easy exp.  Farm named for runes/drops, earn some money for upgrades while there.  DH expeditions are good exp, as long as you have 68+ person gettingthe expedition.  Again, farm runes/drops while you exp to gain cash.  RCoD = lag, but if you can deal with it, great exp, and good maoney to make.  WoS = a place I avoided after my first time there(not due to exp, but due to the idiots), so no comment on it.  I suspect you are not ready for MPG...get 70 first.  RCoD expeditions great with a 68 + getting expedition, but you need a good group to do much there.  Nice exp, nice drops off named, but I have yet to see a rune drop there(maybe we have just been really  unlucky tho.<br />
<br />
As far as levels vs AA's:  Levels will gain you more actual relative power, but higher level zones are designed with the idea that the person has a certain number of AA'S.  Taking a break to farm some AA's might not be the most efficient way to go, but will certainly reduce some pain.</div></div><hr />

I disagree with that statement. I'm about the same level as u with regards to HP's and AC, and I tank MPG just fine. Have all my pre-oow defensive AA's tho. Depends on your puller. If u have a good one, then u'll be ok. Make sure u have a rezzer, if the situation goes south in MPG, then u've got an instant clusterfuck inc.<br />
<br />
RCoD rocks, and during non-primetime, the lag ain't that bad on Trib. <br />
<br />
WoS is a pain. The pathing sucks, and there are too many idiots running around. Forget about pickups here, u'll just get killed. Only with people you trust in WoS.<br />
<br />
Have fun mate.</div></div><hr />

I know i'm way behind on gear/aa's as i just started playing EQ again, but at 6.5k-ish hps, and just under 1300ac unbuffed, i get invites to MPG on a regular basis. it helps to put up LFG like this i find:<br />
<br />
MPG/6.5k Unbuffed or something to that effect. since people have been forced to be a bit pickier with the hard hitting oow mobs, i find that it helps let people know what your capable of.<br />
<br />
I guess i need to turn on AA and grind through all my defensive aa's. just never got around to it and sticking to the age old levels&gt;aa&gt;all route for warriors.</div></div><hr />

I am in VT but have no VT loot. no EP's and i do rather well. But I am geared in SSRA and a few other luclin zones.<br />

<br />
Every now and then try MPG zone in to see how your group fares at those mobs and if able to do it fairly well move in to Hunter/Taskfiend camp.  Prolly need more AA and some better gear though.  Dont forget to toss in some Plane of Tactics pit groups, still decent xp there, especially with your gear.<br />
<br />
Do a search and find what zones have the best xp modifiers and try them out. <br />
<br />
<br />
Also work your epics while xping, every little bit helps.  Find zones that drop attainable upgrades for all and go there, nothing more fun then improving your xp, your gear and watching your friends get upgrades as well.</div></div><hr />

Yes it is possible to tank in MPG with those stats.<br />
<br />
No it is not possible to constantly kill with those stats, unless your cleric has max'd the new FT AAs possibly. A good solid healer will still need a break every 20 to 30min or so until you at least boost your AA's quite a bit. Your average LFG cleric will need to med every other fight more then likely.</div></div><hr />

Grab yourself a healer, a slower and make the rest of the group pure DPS with maybe a patcher (bst or shaman optimal for patches and slows) - grind until you are insane and hate Plane of Fire.</div></div><hr />
