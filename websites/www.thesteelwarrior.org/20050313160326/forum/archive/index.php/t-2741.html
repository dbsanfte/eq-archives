Now in time we are forced to do a major retooling after TT, saryrn, and again in teir 5,  causing a few delays and is basicly a pain in the ass.  <br />
Any ideas on how to avoid this or does anyone not have do this?  I am sick of reforming groups for gods.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Splaktar</div><div class="date">08-27-2003, 11:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We spend about 30-50% of our time in Time forming and reforming groups for Gods and Tier 1... it's real boring, but it does give people a lot of time to AFK in Time...<br />
<br />
Sometimes it's taken us an hour just to form groups for Tier 1... we always just form our own groups, but then people always have to make adjustments to the groups ...<br />
<br />
There's been some suggestions like having 'reserved groups' that basically stay the same every day... but we haven't really tried anything like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mourningloree</div><div class="date">08-27-2003, 10:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We have a group making program that writes out macro files that the eq client reads and knows about all the stats of everyone in the raid (level/aa/resists/hp/ac/mana/atk/etc...) It also knows who's a dualbox of whom, and who works well together so for the most part dealing with groups is a matter of going /who =&gt; fidling with settings, and announcing group changes...  Stage 1 initial takes us about 10 minutes then maybe 5 minutes each change after that.</div></div><hr />

Thirdparty apps aren't exactly legal unless there is some new feature I havn't heard of.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Demorgoth</div><div class="date">08-29-2003, 11:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We enter phase 4, set up 3 groups (assuming numbers available)<br />
<br />
War, war, war, war, dru, brd<br />
Clr, clr, clr, clr, clr, clr, brd<br />
Clr, clr, clr, clr, clr, clr, brd<br />
<br />
War = top 4 MTing warriors<br />
Clr = rotation clerics (solo or duoed)<br />
<br />
Rest of the raid groups up as best they can with what's left<br />
<br />
This is optimal for TZ/VT/RZ/Bert/Inny, and the rest don't need such specific groups. Non-tanking wars in the first group just need to be careful not to take damage faster than the druid can keep up with. if they do and are not next in line to tank, they back out of AE.</div></div><hr />
