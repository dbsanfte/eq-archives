<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jat5</div><div class="date">06-17-2003, 01:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">With that outta the way, I personally hate being defined by my gear while at the same time having no way to influence the preformance of that same gear.<br />
<br />
I, and my groups live and die by my gear. So why shouldn't my toon have figured out some way to make it work better when he really, REALLY, needs it to?<br />
<br />
Here's the idea I had...<br />
<br />
Give me either an AA, or better yet a trainable skill that would allow me to PROC my weapons for 6 seconds every 6 minutes. (duration / refresh to be determined)<br />
<br />
Let me decide to proc that EB weapon just once, right at the start or hold off and fire it before the healer goes into low health aggro.<br />
<br />
Hell, take out the duration make it a one shotter every so often, main hand only while holding a block o cheese offhand, I don't care. Just gimme one single time where I, myself, can nudge events directly to proc a tash, root, EB, DD, stun, whatever, when I need it NOW.<br />
<br />
Grr. Yeah, I did fall victim to the RNG once too often..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Menia</div><div class="date">06-17-2003, 02:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sure would be nice, but you'll still be defined by the gear you wear. If you don't have an EB weapon, you can't proc it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jysin</div><div class="date">06-17-2003, 08:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lol.. I only wish. I think its a cool idea, and had thought how nice it would be a while ago. But realistically, 6 seconds of guarunteed proc'ing would be phenominal aggro. Youre EASILY talking ~20 procs of EB? That margin of aggro would trivialise the hell out of content.<br />
<br />
Not to mention weapons coming out of PoTime like my Etheral Destroyer that proc 750dd. I know I would be out blasting my way through Norrath..lol. Quite unbalanced. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jakle Attakle</div><div class="date">06-17-2003, 12:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">9 seconds of procs on main hand only?<br />
<br />
3-5 EB procs when you need it with a 5 minute refresh time?<br />
<br />
I wouldn't consider that too unbalancing.<br />
<br />
The whole point is to keep the agro on the warrior. It's not like 2250-3750 worth of procs is going to unbalance the game on the mobs you fight Jysin :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jysin</div><div class="date">06-18-2003, 04:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you dont think 9 seconds of mainhand (EB proc) is unbalancing, you need to take a step back and think. Take your average hasted.. we can even go with BoC warrior here. 3-5 procs? far far far too low. Keep in mind, PC's do not need to connect to proc. We are talking more like 20'ish procs at a guess. 750 x 20 = 15,000 hate at the click of a button!! If you dont see how this is trivialising, then you need to wake up bro. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jat5</div><div class="date">06-18-2003, 05:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, yeah, 6 seconds of straight procs would be a bit much even with a 6 minute refresh.<br />
<br />
So what's wrong with procing primary and secondary ONCE every 3 minutes on command?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jysin</div><div class="date">06-18-2003, 05:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I understand the basic concept of what youre saying here, and really its not a bad idea if implemented right. 9sec is too long, and mainhand + offhand proc once per 3 minutes would do virtually nothing, but slight stability on incoming pulls. Before spending all the time tweaking out timings of duration and re-use, I really think it would be much better spent fixing the base of our problem (taunt (there are already numerous threads with great ideas on improving warrior taunt ability)) without still having to rely on procs as a crutch.</div></div><hr />
