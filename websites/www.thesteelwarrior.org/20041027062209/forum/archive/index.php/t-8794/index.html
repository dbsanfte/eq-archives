<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kahzul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just looking for a quick gearcheck.  My cousin quit EQ and left me his Split blade, which I really love and with love it more when i get an aug to go with it.  Im using the helanic tundra serries, but was wondering if you thought it was comparable to ornate?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sell the SBoD and get the Droga combo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mavelloc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">hmm the sbod is fine for now as i can see since he already has the chos and the bloodsworn dont proc till lvl 56 which he still needs another 4 lvls before he can accually use it but once he hits 56 i would suggest the droga combo or go with gsot since they are very cheap but need to wait till 56 till he can use the proc also look into getting some stat food like grobb liquidized meat and halas meat pies since i dont see anything that he is using that has stats on food</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mavelloc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">also just noticed shoulders but you may want to look into this quest for that<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">SotB procs at 40.<br />

  SBoD is an overpriced piece of junk. It's been discussed up and down these boards. Sell it to someone who doesn't know better. You will get better gear from it.<br />
<br />
  1ac = 1sta = 6hp until sta capped. Run with that, compare all gear that way and you're set.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mavelloc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">just noticed that on ala, i looked it up really quick on ala and closed the window, does not have the up to date pic for it but if that procs at 40 then sotb in main and chos in off hand till proc works for chos will work better then, since the proc will work then get rid of the sbod and save up for some ornate or something in bazaar or just save the cash and spend on alts  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>haddion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Fierce heraldic pauldrons are also a good, cheap upgrade if you don't like questing.  Get a stonewood compound bow, or any ele bow for your ranged slot.  Start your quest for a loyalist shield of honor.  It is an easy quest if you catch him up and have a few caster friends.  Swap your weapons around if you plan to stick with SBoD.  To me its all graphic effects and in essence a dps weapon.</div></div><hr />
