<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Colcannon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Here's a 51st level warrior who don't read as much as he should.  He has some good gear cause he has some higher level friends but not a lot of cash.  He's planin' on workin' LDoNs maybe in Tak to get Heat Blade and Haste Augs.  He is doin' 100% AA till Run 3 and will then go back to 100% level.  He thinks its time to replace the ear rings and otherwise work on resists.<br />
<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=923587<br />
<br />
He'd like to hear what other worrior think of this plan and/or what other tips they would have at this point.<br />
<br />
Please be as specific as possible.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Qest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">First of all, stop referring to yourself in the 3rd person.<br />
<br />
In what area you feel you need help?<br />
<br />
Do you need advice on how to earn plat?  Do you have plat and not know how to spend it?  If so, how much?  Do you or your companions feel you need to keep agro better?  Would they rather you took a hit better?  Would they rather you had more hitpoints or resisted more spells?<br />
<br />
What classes/levels are your usual companions?  For instance, if you are usually healed by a cleric, more hitpoints might be the way to go to max CH efficiency.  If you use a druid or shaman as main healer, you might be better off with AC.  If you have some high-agro people in the group, you might need to work on getting and keeping agro.<br />
<br />
Do you play just for fun and adventure?  Do you wish to power-level?  Would you be happier with better gear or more xp or do you want to know which would be more powerful?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Replace your earrings and rings first, then replace all your armor with some type of heraldic armor. Since you don't worship rallos zek (shame on you) you can't get the nice fierce heraldic armor.<br />
<br />
rings: valorium ring of gallantry<br />
earrings: bloodmetal earring<br />
armor: some type of heraldic (then go for ornate)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Colcannon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The target is to be the best tank for a group (and in the future on raids) as possible.  The group members vary, but a cleric is most often there.  Someone else almost always pulls, but getting &amp; keeping agro is not currently a problem and it mustn't be alowed to become one.   So that is a priority.<br />
<br />
&quot;... not a lot of cash.&quot;  Money is short but not an issue unless the advice is to buy gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Renix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I suggest you level until you hit 55, then buy a GSoT for 100~ PP. Significantly better agro than anything thats in your magelo, and it has a good ratio too, so you'd get more DPS.<br />
<br />
And how much money do you have available to you? I could suggest some good upgrades within your price range, if i knew how much money you had.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Qest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">LDoN is decent money and xp and will probably be more fun and teach you to be a better warrior than camping stuff will.<br />
<br />
I'd suggest making leveling your priority and ignoring your gear unless you start feeling really deficient.  As suggested, grab a GSoT at level 55 and you're golden.  Add Anger3 or Ykesha to that and you have something that will last a looooooooooong time.<br />
<br />
If you do find a deficiency, go xp in places like LoY, Droga, or Chardok with your strong group, you get nice cash and valuable (20k-ish) items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jubea of Luclin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">omg first get some good rings earings and neck whacha got needs to go :( <br />
<br />
other than that i would say look for items with raw hps to replace whatever you decide to replace, dont just get raw hps but make sure there is some on it, b/c once max stamina you need raw hps (and you can achive max sta with shaman buffs)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">One thing that lept out at me is that you have a couple pieces of Moktar, and a crappy face slot.  Next trip up to UP, farm a death mask of the Elysians, nice free upgrade that you can get while EXPing.  Other than that, work on hp's, alot.  Far too much of your gear has no hp's at all on it.  As some one mentioned, look at cultural armor as affordable, bigtime upgrades for most slots.  Also as mentioned above, once you can use it, a GSoT will be a nice upgrade for tanking.  If you want to spend a bit more, then CHoS and SotBS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Naralli_VoLS</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Welcome to the SteelWarrior boards Colcannon!<br />
<br />
As suggested the best thing for you to work on is your jewelry as it is probably the easiest to do at first. The suggestion of valorium rings of Gallantry, Blood earring of rage, etc. are great, but you will find they are way out of your price range at 6k and 15k each on your server. The best thing to do is check the bazaar for particular slots you want to upgrade and search based on the stats you are after. Example: search for rings+hitpoints and see what is available. Find something you want/like and then do some research where the items are available/dropped and or how much they are. Once you determine that an item is farmable by your group then simply head there and get the item.<br />
<br />
Once your group is over 55+ you could try to tackle the King in Droga and the Seer to get yourself a  copper hammer of striking and a sword of the bloodsworn; both of those one hand weapons<br />
are probably the best you will get until you join a guild that tackles SSRA/PoP zones. I believe you already have a Greatstaff of Thunder ( right? ) so you are set there for 2hander. It really is the best thing you will get until you are guilded. <br />
At 55+ your group should be able to start tackling the arena in Kael for armor upgrades as well if you want to try that route, altho the armor available from LDoN points is far superior to anything you will receive in Kael once you accumulate the points to spend. I really doubt you will ever come up with the coin to purchase the cultural armor mentioned here. Unless you are into tradeskills to the point of getting grandmaster level skill in a tradeskill ( which takes some serious coin to achieve/ and farming materials ad nauseum ) money is only attained by selling off an item of value won via a roll in a group.<br />
<br />
Also remember you have a tremendous resource in a friend online who has a 65 warrior who went through exactly what you will in the 50's ( the 50's very hard for warriors IMHO )<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

The gear is, but as far as the numbers magelo generates it is not accurate and frankly i dont care enough to muck around with it to fix it.<br />

ok, yeah i was like your ac and attack is no way that low</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Colcannon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Hello Naralli,  <br />
<br />
My thanks to you and all posting advise here.  I will certainly consider this advice.<br />
<br />
Jubea, thanks for your post too. An, &quot;OMG, this needs ta go&quot; post was very much what I was looking for here.<br />
<br />
Indeed my higher level friends and Naralli in particular have been more than kind and generous and extremely helpful thus far and I shall not over look that resource.  I will never thank you enough, so, thanks again.<br />
<br />
A GSoT is in the bank waiting for the required level to be used and the 2HB skill is coming along nicely.<br />
<br />
Multiple K items are quite a streach.  The most that has ever been in the bank was about 3K and there is only around 500 now and there is this rogue that keeps taking it to work on trade skills...<br />
<br />
One thing that may have been implied but not said is what to do with adventure points.  The chest plate came from there and I'm closing on the price for the Crypt Robbers Earring, AC:3, HP:20, FR:5, CR:5, MR:5, DR:5, PR:5, type1,type7.  I like all the resists.  <br />
<br />
Should I hold the adventure points for bigger ticket items, like the armor, Anger3 and Ykesha  or work on lesser Augs and Items, Like the earring, the Worn Gravestone of Awareness, Effect:See Invisible, or  Warm Emerald Shard, Effect:Heated Blade?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Naralli_VoLS</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Heya Col,<br />
<br />
I would save the points for the bigger ticket items you have mentioned. I also wouldnt worry to much about resists as you can request resist buffs in group and also you are not going to be running into anything that requires you to have sufficient resists until you are guilded anyways. The first real resists required place you will encounter is likely to be in Temple of Veeshan in the Halls of testing: which is a guild raid event at your current level ( most guilds generally request that you be at least level 55 to raid there ). Once you have developed your gear/resists/hit points and AA's it is possible to single group the Halls of Testing ( i have done it ) althought at that point you really dont want the armor drops except for alts or selling as a MQ.<br />
Your focus right now should be on acquiring hit point/AC items. If these items have +stamina it will help you now but above 62+ you will be hoping to replace as much stamina stuff with Pure raw +hit points items. My opinion is the sooner you get adding +hit points/AC stuff the better off you are.<br />
As for AA i agree that you should do run3 till it is done then switch to Full exp until you are 65. Experience at 65 comes easier as you are fighting in the higher end zones with greater experience. Example: A decent group in Plane of Valor in the inner cave I was able to get a full AA point every 80 Minutes.<br />
The other thing that can Help you out is to Focus on a weapon type for now ( perhaps wait until you are 55 and can use the GSOT ). See what weapon style you prefer to use ( 1 hand vs 2hand )and sell off the other weapons for some cash that you can use to upgrade other gear slots.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>paladiin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Tons of fun upgrade options for you! And if you're planning on going to PoP soon (which is probably likely due to having higher level friends) you're going to want to upgrade fairly soon.<br />
<br />
Here's the quick list of what really doesn't need upgrading soon: Helm, Velium Fire Wedding Ring (you can go to 65 with it if needed - I did), Arms, Range, and maybe shoulders.  Pretty much everything else needs to be gutted and redone, before doing serious PoP tanking (excluding PoJ junk).<br />
<br />
What to do, what to do for upgrades?  Sure, if you're loaded with plat your upgrade path would be fairly easy.  But sounds like that's not an option.  So we're looking at &quot;bang for the plat&quot;.<br />
<br />
Earring:  Jagged Bone Hoop.  6ac and 40hp on a shoestring budget - easily under 1k, and I've seen it for as low as 400pp. Black Sapphire Electrum Earring is another cheap option (2ac 35hp).  I personally use (since I'm perpetually broke) a Forgotten Ebony Earring (10ac 50hp) which is a new drop in Velks which is campable with a group at your level (though pretty rare).<br />
<br />
Neck:  Ribbon Choker (7ac 45hp) should be fairly cheap, as is the better Amulet of Mummy Wrappings (12ac 45hp and lots of stats). I have personally seen both of these at 500pp before on my server.  The Amulet would probably be worth going higher if you have the plat for it.<br />
<br />
Face:  Grobb Hide Mask (7ac 30hp 2sta) or Crystal Spider Eyes (8ac 35hp) are two inexpensive upgrades for you.<br />
<br />
Finger:  Cheap-o Velium Fire Wedding Ring until you can get the highly recommended Valorium Ring of Gallantry.<br />
<br />
Wrists:  I'd recommend keeping an eye out for cheap Thurg MQ's - I know on FV you can put together the Champion's wrists for ~500pp.  <br />
<br />
Hands: Again, a Champion's MQ would be perfect here, if you can find one for a good price.  I personally have sold corroded plate gauntlets for 100pp.  Worn Zraxthril Gauntlets (16ac 30hp and stats) are a minor upgrade and should be fairly inexpensive as well.  There are also some LDoN gauntlets such as the Sandstorm Fragment Gauntlets (22ac 40hp and stats) which if found for cheap would be an option.<br />
<br />
Chest: Your current piece is passable, but I'd suggest saving to take a step up.  The Architect's Bejeweled Chestplate (54ac 60hp 5sta) is very nice, and is usually between 5k and 10k.  Save your plat and watch the market for this one, and it'll be a great piece for the price for you to grow into. <br />
<br />
Back: Crinose Cape of the Werewolf (12ac 80hp and stats) is very nice, and will likely only run you a K or 2.  <br />
<br />
Legs: Kylong Greaves have dropped quite a bit in price (35ac 45hp and stats), or you can probably camp them with a group.  Would be a nice upgrade for you.<br />
<br />
<br />
Just a few ideas for cheap or fairly easily obtainable upgrades.  There are always bigger and better items, but these shouldn't run you more than just a few thousand plat for some fairly decent upgrades in both HP and AC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Colcannon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I have accumulated a k here and there and shopping for bargins in the bazaar is showing how good your advice is Paladiin.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Santhar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Since you mentioned you might be doing Tak adventures, might I suggest a Sunstone Face Cover (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=24228) (10 ac 10 sta 5 wis/intel 10 diease). For a low price of 130 adv points, I thought it was a great upgrade from an Antlered Mask.  There is also a pair of earrings I am thinking of getting, Geomancer's Ritual Hoop (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=25511) for 100 points (if I can ever win a stamina aug for it) and another that escapes me right now (stats are like 5 ac 5 sta and +hps and other stats for 230 adv points.)</div></div><hr />
