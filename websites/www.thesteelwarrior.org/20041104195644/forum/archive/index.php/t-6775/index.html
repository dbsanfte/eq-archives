<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kujawa Zek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I remember reading some posts about single groupable mobs. Such as Va'dyn, Kland, and other mobs. I can't seem to find the thread (Yes I used search  :D ). Any got any ideas? Friends and I hydra 62 war (Sometimes log on 65 war if I can't handle it &gt;&lt;), 65 cleric, 65 rogue, 63 bard, 65 sham, and 65 necro. Any ideas on some mobs we can do for fun. Doing the cleric epic was kinda fun (Trains in chardok were huge and hilarious lol). Any ideas would be great. Yes, we do BoT Mini named. Thanks in advance !<br />

i have to call bs on shei being on groupable, he has around 500k hp and gets an unmezzable add every 2 minutes, you would need 2 tanks just for shei alone and then another tank to somehow deal with all the adds youre getting <br />
<br />
rizlona would definately need to be an elemental or time group to 1 group, with the half elf life plus the dragon form thats quite a bit of hp to go through on the sol ro mini that i remember doing the highest dps to me <br />

lady nev would be pretty tough as well, that spin stun sucks and with 1 group it could take close to an hour to get here down, if not more, which in that case youve got repops to worry about</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Shei can be done with less than a group. You have to be creative and his particular group make up wouldn't be able to do it, but it can be done. Some of the fights would certainly take a pretty stout tank to single group, but I don't see a single mob on that list that I don't agree with. I would even go so far as to add the AoW to that list. I've participated in a 9 man kill that was a cake walk, I don't think a single group would have much more trouble.<br />

Can add all of the GoD trial 1-6 named as well.</div></div><hr />

Rizlona from what i recall was nothing all that special...<br />

COTH works in ToV just need to get a mage and/or corpse near old mischief and you don't need to deal with any flurries.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Lady Tarnia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'm curious how you can aviod the DT on Shei, along with singling TT and VZ given the make up and number of adds that are in those enounters.  Bottom line for most things that used to require large numbers and are now 1-2 groupable are dependent on the group make-up, number of aas and sheer playing ability.  For the orginal poster, I would recommend trying the early expansion mobs first and work  his way up.  They have less hp and generally  easier to try.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Mourningloree</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Don't let anyone die on Shei, the DT is on a fixed timer...<br />
VZ Can be cherry picked unless that's been changed...<br />
TT just need to have a bad mofo kiter, that might be the hardest of the list since heal aggro will hurt on gargoyles.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Aten Ha Ra, Shadow Master Vintra, Diaku Overseer, Glykus Hymnoir, Eindride Icestorm, Byrnju Thunderclap, Kuanbyr Hailstorm, Aullife Chaoswind, Thought Horror Overfiend, Arch Lich`Rhag Zadume, Prototypes in PoI, HoH villiager/crazied norrathian trails, Mujaki the Devourer, Innoruuk in Nadox, Xanamech, The Sleep Walker, Dain Frostreaver, Guardian of the Seal, Korocrust, Master of the Guard, Protegenator, Doomshade, Acidic Mass and Cogboggle Ring.<br />
<br />
<br />
add those to the list adn your complete =)<br />
<br />
All of those are one groupable, with the right group make-up/skill level.  To whomever said lots of vt couldn't be done with one group, theres 2 hydra teams on saryrn that do them regularly on different days of the week.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Mourningloree</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">No offense Mourningloree but I some of those mobs you listed would be one of those I have to see it with my own eyes  :).<br />
<br />
Probably, that was a rough guide of what I'd think is possible with people in my guild just by going down an old list of mobs.  Which is why I said a) It will devolve into a vanity thing.  and b) It's completely depedent on level of gear and gameplay.  Given that I'm talking about 12.7k tanks, 10.5k monks, Clerics with 8k mana etc...<br />
<br />
I *HAVE* done several of the VT names with one group though just to see if it could be done, the plan was to abort if we couldn't beat respawn and just box more chars for DPS...  But it IS possible.  Bard there is so key.</div></div><hr />

<br />
frogger, you do realize you said AHR was 1 groupable but CT was not? CT is cake compared to most the mobs on that list<br />
<br />
rizlona was hardest sol ro mini imo, he was hardest fight out of all of them for me</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Froggerx Xreggorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">fixed,   Divine Stun from pallies = shei's DT interupted, if timed you can pull it off with minimal people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Konjunktion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">While we're on the subject of small group content..<br />
<br />
What do you guys think would be the best way to gear up a dedicated and skilled group or two of 63-65'ish individuals these days? Most of us have a sizeable bank roll to flesh out in upper end bazaar stuff (nothing crazy like Helmets of Rallos Zek or Flayed Barb Hide Leggings) but covering the essentials like certain ornate pieces and focus effects for casters. <br />
<br />
We've looked at Droga for the quested flowing thought items there for priests and casters.<br />
We've looked at the Dozekar quests for some haste and resist items.<br />
We're hoping to be able to handle the BoT minis for more ornate, Auliffe and the easier tower mobs for some upgrades there as well...<br />
<br />
I doubt any of the Thurg or SS quest armors would really be worth the time investment considering how outdated they are.. and much of Luclin content requires large numbers (SSRa, VT), or has less then amazing rewards (Rumblecrush, Va'Dyn'ish type things). Most of PoP is out for us for similar reasons.. don't have the numbers.<br />
<br />
When can we concievably head towards what I figure will be our gold mine in GoD? Seems like all those trials were designed for small groups and the loots I've seen being linked from way out there are ridiculous. Is LDON our best bet? Say it aint so :)<br />

I just left the lower-end raiding guild I was in.  I'm now evaling with an elemental guild, but I'm not sure it's going to be a good fit for me.  So, chances are I'll still be hanging out with my group of friends that I've known for ages.  Now I'm just curious as to what mobs on that list we could do with LDoN level gear, once we're done with that.  Should be fun to find out :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Goradain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Evolved Burrower, provided you can beat everyone else to the punch, is frigging easy and has insane drops for his difficulty.<br />
<br />
For all practical purposes, that list is pointless.  At the level you would need to be to handle single grouping alot of that stuff there would be no point in doing so except to see if you could or to twink out your alts.  That being said a good puller and/or good CCer would be all the difference in most of those fights.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Froggerx Xreggorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">ahh ya, forgot burrower in acrylia hehe - for prototypes, they only banish when people fall below 60%.... so basically get a bard, DMF, and talisman of the tribunal - have your healer(s) make sure you dont drop that low and ya win.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Lady Tarnia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Konjunction, <br />
If you have 2 solid groups that are used to working together, you may want to look at heading to the BOT towers.  Also consider working towards the Ferubi mini's as the augs they drop are very nice and the exp is awesome.   You could also try Xanamech which drops a nice haste item and is easier than questing the pieces in Doz and it does not have the faction issues.  Korocrust is another very small group friendly encounter.  <br />
<br />
As for equiping your folks, ornate and ldon are generally your best for now.  If you can, do the hard ldons as the drops are generally useful and the points come fast.  It also is a good way to ease into the smackdown of GoD mobs.  You will want your tanks to get their ac/hps up along with def aa.  Also make sure they have good aggro weapons with anger 3 so your casters can up their dps as well w/o the worry of pulling aggro (within reason).  <br />
<br />
If your group is used to working together, it makes things alot easier as the need for specific communication is down and everyone knows how to anticipate what each group member will do.</div></div><hr />

Luckily that's the one thing we do have... three of us are roommates and the others are friends from high school. We use voice chat programs to just talk and hang out, or to coordinate raids and PvP.<br />
<br />
Since I'm the tank, looks like a lot of the burden of success falls squarely on my HP/AC and AA's. Thank you guys for the suggestions.<br />

<br />
We had people getting banished who hadn't cast any spells or hit the mob yet and were still at almost full health.  I dunno how banish is determined on those, but it seems awful random to me.  I tanked one Proto through the entire fight, fell below 20% at one point (when the healers were all banished for a moment) and never once got banished myself.  /shrug.  Best bet?  Pull all 3 of them into one room and just keep running back there when you get banished.  Actually, now that I think about it, I wonder if it might be possible to just have 3 groups and pull each of them at once to the room they banish in (if that makes sense).  Then when you got banished you stay in the room you are already fighting in.  I bet that would work.</div></div><hr />

Thank you guys for the suggestions.Completely true. In most cases when doing loot dropping mobs with multiple groups you have enough healers to make up for a lack of AC/HP/AAs. When you only have 1/2 groups to work with, every slot is much more critical. If you are a little light on AC/HP/AAs, then you have to dedicate more slots to healers. As you gain more power, you can start replacing healers with DPS.</div></div><hr />

It's not a hard encounter but I'd be interested in the bard (or anyone else for that matter) that could kite all the butterflies and the four gargs with success.  Toss in the full dispell on the tank and it would be pretty nasty to try and six person it, even with very superior gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Bulbog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">XTC wouldn't be hard to one group it'd just take long as hell.  Can TM's even repop while you're doing the cursed cycle?  Well anyway everything in the Cursed cycle is one groupable just takes long as hell to kill.  Pretty sure the despawn timer stops running once you pull it.  If you had any repops it would just be the wandering TM which you could easily just break off and kill real quick.  The cycle would take 2+ hours or so though, not sure as to guess how long.  War, Cleric, Bard, Ranger, Enc, Wiz or something like that could do it though np.  The warrior and the ranger could tradeoff between DT's on exiled.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I've singled grouped Vindi before, even before I had any Raex gear and my BoW.  He has about 200k hp on the dot, but you're chaining CHs, so it's a matter of burning him down before your cleric runs OOM.<br />
<br />
I've also single grouped Korucust.  It was actually seven though because we had one bard out of the group.  Tough, tough fight though.  Korucust's dps is less than Vindi's, but it's more spikey because of his 1600dd proc (unresistable).  As long as you keep the AEs (manadrain and spell slow) off your cleric you (or simply cure it IMMEDIATELY), you're golden.  Korucust has about 225-275k hp.<br />
<br />
Guardian of the Seal in The Hole.  Get an SK or Necro to pet pull his guards so you have GotS single.  He's a rather tricky mob though because his dps is extremely high.  He doesn't hit quite as fast as Vindi does once slowed (disease, partial), but he makes up for it with his much higher ATK.  Essentially, you have 3 minutes to kill him because once your Defensive drops, you're dead.  The offset?  GotS only has about 125k hp.  I've single grouped him on many occasions.  Oh yeah, druid ATK debuffs work wonders on this mob.<br />
<br />
I could see Cursed being single groupable.  I think your hardest challenge would be defeating Exiled really, as he Death Touches.  Cursed's dps is extremely high unslowed (Quad 600s + Flurry), but he's FULLY slowable.  His dps drops down to about 220-260 or so once slowed, crippled, and debuffed.  Just time his AE to minimize group healing and you could probably CH all day long.  After that, it's just a matter of burning through his ridiculous amounts of HP/AC.  I'd imagine Cursed has around 600-700k hp or so.<br />

You could probably single group all but Protector of Dresolik in Sol Ro Tower.  It's just a matter of GETTING to them first.  Jiva might be pushing it though, but none of the minis are even remotely difficult.  They just have gobs and gobs of hitpoints.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">As for NToV, you could probably single group every named but Vyemm actually.  I went back there about two weeks ago and was suprised to find that the named, once slowed, are probably the biggest putzes I have ever seen.  They're completely and UTTERLY laughable.  Why?  Because they're all (except for Vyemm and Kriezenn) fully slowable.  Your only problem, as with a lot of mobs, is simply getting to them.  Aaryonar is single groupable, but it would not be very fun.  You would get constant repops during the fight from the little drakelets that add, provided you position him in the standard corner.  Your only other problem would simply be gaters.  Flurry drakes are vicious (and they do a lot more dps than the named dragons), but there are only 6 or 8 of them total.</div></div><hr />

As i'm a guildleader/main tank, I always put a mage and bard in my group, bard with good aa's+mage ds+self ds/potion, reverse from clr (34dmg i think) - means everytime your touched your dealing around 180 points of damage. with sotw, probably around 210-220. <br />
<br />
Krizenn could be done with a few without a problem, we cleared out lots of ntov with 15 people or so... vyemm was a cake walk, just positioned my self next to a wall after shrinking and anytime I didn't resist the knockback I wouldn't move.  Worked great, pretty sure with a high ds and maybe a few good dps classes you'd be able to do him with one group.</div></div><hr />

We typcially do two groups, which is definate overkill.  We have not had any luck getting an enchanter to slow him, even with tash and malo on him.  I have never gotten malosinia to stick with my mage.  We have done him once and I failed to hit my defensive on my warrior and he dropped very very early in the fight, our paladin took over.  It was a very close fight, using the quickest heals, my cleric and druid were oom, but we won.<br />

We typically do him with 2-3 groups.  He is a good challenging fight. The key is keeping the AoE off of your casters.  So, keep them behind the nearby walls and go for it.  I can only imagine doing him with 6, would be a very very fun fight :)<br />

We had a full compliment of 3 groups both times for him.  As long as you remove greater curse on the main tank before healing, you should be ok healing wise.  He is a real pussy cat once slowed as you can see, especially when you consider his drops vs comparable other named mobs.<br />

Unfortunately I have not put in my Cursed logs as of yet, but will edit the post once I do.</div></div><hr />

Guardian of the Seal is slowable via magic, but his MR is so high it's not even worth trying.  He isn't, however, very particularly resistant against disease.  *hint*  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">since XtC been mentioned a few times gonna bring this up. has anyone ever noticed XtC seems to rampage 2 targets at once? last time we did XtC a beast lord and a cleric in my guild who are extremely knowledgable players both SWORE they each had rampage, beast lord said it wasnt just ripostes either, and that he was still being hit after he turned off attack. i was grouped with someone who had target of target ldr AA and so i knew that aggro never came off me. was weird and am curious if anyone else ever seen this?</div></div><hr />
