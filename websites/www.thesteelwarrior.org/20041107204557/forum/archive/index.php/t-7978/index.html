<br />
I have finally gotten back to the original warrior I first created in EQ.  He is my first character I ever created.  I am working him upto 65 to be our guilds MT.  I was just curious as to how many HP's per level does a warrior gain when he levels?  I am currently level 54 almost 55. <br />
<br />
Also if you have any advice for an aspiring warrior.  I do know the game and have read just about every thread in the library and quite a few on the other boards as well.  <br />
<br />
Anyhow thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">roughly 30 per level. a good rule of thumb is level/10 = current modifier, but it's not exact. your stamina modifier doesn't increase on every level, more like every 3 or 5. it's kinda wonky!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think the magelo forums would give you the best answer. Or just play iwth your magelo and see what differances the levels make. DOn't think I have ever seen magelo off on Hp.</div></div><hr />
