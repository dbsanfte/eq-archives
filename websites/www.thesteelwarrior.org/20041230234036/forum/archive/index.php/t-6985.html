<br />
I'm looking for a list of the PoP mobs and which is better to use on each - defensive or evasive.<br />
<br />
If you remember this thread and can point me to it that would be great.<br />
<br />
Also, I'm specifically concernd about Xanamech and the 4 BoT tower bosses (in case someone can't point me to the entire listing)<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

Library thread, Ubermob Tanking - summary and discussion (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=13).  Always takes me a few minutes to find, cuz I'm looking for *Evasive and Defensive List* or such.</div></div><hr />

Anybody care to be a little less technical in that break down?  I too have been pondering the merits of evasive/defensive but couldn't find what I needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">05-05-2004, 04:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Barney explanation:<br />
<br />
In general, defensive is good.  Tanks usually die to damage spikes, and defensive makes the damage spikes more survivable.  Also, there's no aggro penalty while defensive.<br />
<br />
If the mob's minimum hit is very high (i.e. a significant portion of its max hit), then defensive won't be very effective, so you probably want evasive instead.  You see many such mobs in Luclin.<br />
<br />
If the mob gets a bonus effect for hitting you (i.e. nasty procs or flurries), then defensive won't reduce those effects, so you probably want evasive instead.  You see a few such mobs in POP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">05-05-2004, 07:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Basically, up until this stuff was figured out, everyone assumed that defensive was the way to go on everything.  It was such a huge deal to be 55 and get defensive, and no one really gave 2 craps about evasive.<br />
<br />
Once we figured out how damage bonus and damage interval worked, and what each of the disciplines did, we found out that Evasive was definitely equal in value to defensive, and it could be argued that it was superior.<br />
<br />
When I did need to use a disc, it was usually evasive, because of the recycle time on it being a little faster than Defensive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abynormal777</div><div class="date">05-05-2004, 09:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Any idea which one is best to use for the PoI dragon?  (Xamamech)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">05-05-2004, 10:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That thread told you how to figure out which one is more useful.  Tank him, log it, and determine what's better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">05-05-2004, 02:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">theres been a few mobs in ikkinz raids who have a really high minium hit. max hit was 1500, min hit was like 1400.<br />
<br />
when there is that little variation, defensive just isnt doing much since it doesnt effect the min hit at all. just watch the dmg and eyeball it. <br />
<br />
no one totally agrees, i still think defensive is better for xegony than evasive. its the dmg spikes that kill ya. its true u will take less dmg in evasive, but who cares if the dmg spike from her flurry that nails ya. hoping u evade during flurry rounds just doesnt make sense to me where as you at least mitigate every hit with defensive.</div></div><hr />

i use evasive for pretty much everything, unless i find out it hits for over 3500. I also tend to use defensive in 1 group situations.</div></div><hr />
