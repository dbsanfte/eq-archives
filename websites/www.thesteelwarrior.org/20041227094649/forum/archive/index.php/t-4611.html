<br />
A few things of note.<br />
<br />
Openings are broken down by Offensive Openings, Defensive Openings, Speciality Openings, and Error Openings (NPC Fumbles).<br />
<br />
Offensive Openings are triggered by meleeing.<br />
<br />
Defensive Openings are triggered by tanking (taking damage/being hit).<br />
<br />
Specialty Openings are triggered by Kick/Bash.<br />
<br />
Error Openings are triggered by the NPC screwing up.<br />
<br />
Warriors are supposed to have the highest chance to trigger Defensive Openings. Currently that is not working properly (I parse twice the Offensive Openings as compared to Defensive Openings atm).<br />
<br />
Several skills are currenly not working and/or being reviewed for efficacy and real world value.<br />
<br />
I didn't have Flurry up as a Hot Button when going through my first round of data gathering. It comes up on an Offensive Opening and I THINK a Specialty Opening. I just left it blank for the time being.<br />
<br />
Rage and Rallying Cry only open via an NPC Error Opening at the moment, one more opening will be added to both of these in the near future.<br />
<br />
The data gathered comes from busting my ass for hour upon hour upon hour as well as harassing developers for hour upon hour upon hour and cross referencing Lucy.<br />
<br />
Everything you see here is subject to change, leave the whining to the professionals.<br />
<br />
One more thing of note, personalized sounds will be added to these openings. That is, you will be allowed to link .wav and .mp3 files to the different openings for a unique sound cue. Start rounding up the Homer/Cartman soundbites ASAP.<br />
<br />
Also, the abilities will each have their own unique particle effect. I was PROMISED a Flying Flaming Rallos Zek Axe. Ok, I lie... but it needs to happen.<br />
<br />
P.S. If someone wants to convert that to a table that is visible in this post so you don't have to click the link, feel free. I would do it save for the fact that I have no clue how to do it...</div></div><hr />

Btw, any chance for an explanation on the colors used in the table you linked ?<br />

<br />
And where is that DOH sound for NPC fumbles .. heh. :p</div></div><hr />

I have been having a very frustrating time with 20 hot keys up I finaly got most of them well 8offence and 8defense in order.<br />
<br />
the olny problem I see now is that if you are not staring at the combat skill window waiting for an opening you will miss it or not have enough time to click anything by the time you realize there is an opening.<br />
<br />
now if your meleeing a mob (not MTing) and ignoring chat then its ok but if you look away for a split second then youll miss it. <br />
<br />
The should have the window pop up with a sound or someting (like that mp3 thing you mentioned) then give your brain like 0.5 seconds to analize whats gonig on,before the timer starts. <br />
<br />
most of the time when i realize there is an opening half the time is gone before i know it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Flurry is broken with 2hs, it attempts to &quot;crush&quot; and is a non magic attack (hence, lots of things are invulnerable). Backswing and slice are also bugged this way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
anyway someone could add on the reuse timers too all of that? or are they all 10 min?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Szlia</div><div class="date">12-06-2003, 07:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not that it is critical, but it seems that you MUST have auto attack on to have openings. Getting beat on for 4 hours did not create a single defensive opening nor a NPC error one (Note that it might be because I was in a zone where they were not activated or something).<br />
<br />
For now they also work like spells. Read: you must be standing and not stunned or silenced. That is also true for discs. I assume it's temporary, but maybe some of you know more.<br />
<br />
Also note that using an abbility stops any running disc. So you cannot be defensive and reduce the dmg taken even more once in a while or add yourself some agro using openings. Not sure about the short time reuse abbilities that are not tied to openings since monks atm don't have any.<br />
<br />
As much as I like the general mechanisms of this new system and think it can have a lot of potential, I am not too convinced by the abbilities at the moment. More than half the monks abbilities result in a random and marginal dps increase or a random and marginal dmg taken decrease....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dakryn</div><div class="date">12-06-2003, 07:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well that would make sense just because if you are getting attacked and you arent attacking back.....youre either afk and the openings dont do any good anyway....or if you are there you obviously dont want to harm the mob so if theres no defensive like openings then you dont want to do anything to the mob through an opening either.<br />
/shrug Casual observation.Havent had time to log on test and check it myself</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Itzlegend</div><div class="date">12-07-2003, 01:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">that you can only receive openings from the mob you have targeted, and while you are fighting (autoattack on).   So no, you can't pull 10 mobs in a normal adventure and get an bunch of defensive openings ( i went to plane of fear and had about 40 mobs beating on me.  Got the same amount of defensive openings as I did with 1 mob on me in fire)<br />
<br />
<br />
BTW if you want my opinion on all this shit.. well i guess that is my opinion - &quot;shit&quot;.  Good system, worthless execution.<br />
<br />
Provoke aside, All of these abilities constitute less of an overall effectiveness upgrade than ldon.  And good lord is that saying a lot.  Again discluding provoke, not one of these abilities is worth the long term hassle of studying and watching for openings.   Tie a sound to them?  Yea, that will certainly enhance my teamspeak experiance...<br />
<br />
Go exp for an hour in earth for a few hours useing your best openings.  Then go exp in earth for a few hours without useing a single one.  What was the difference?   3 dps? 4?    Maybe 3 less DPS intake?    Once the brief novelty of the system wears off, which do you really think you'll enjoy more?<br />
<br />
The effects of these abilities need to be increased exponentially.  They need to MATTER.  They need to DO something.   In exchange, the endurance cost needs to go up to huge amounts - similar to how the powerful bard songs are balanced with mana cost.  <br />
<br />
If that can't be done without screwing up class 'balance' then theres no sense in adding all this confusing bullshit that in the end, does nothing.  Adding extra buttons to push does not give a melee diversity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raaj</div><div class="date">12-07-2003, 01:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">They should either make them better like Itzlegend suggested, or even untie a few of them from requiring an opening.<br />
<br />
If I could power slam or rally cry every 20-30 seconds ala the provoke line, things would be quite a bit better. Nobodys going to use but 4-5 of these, since you won't blow an inferior one when you could use one of the best.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">12-07-2003, 01:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Great work on the skills table.  <br />
<br />
To summarize my thoughts below... Itzlegend is right.  These are some weak freaking skills.  <br />
<br />
What I don't get is how this is going to help our balance issues much at all.  The vast majority of these skills seem terribly underpowered.  I mean, one of the more expensive ones is &quot;decrease mob chance to riposte by 50% for 3 ticks&quot;.  oh boy!  If you're lucky you'll save yourself a hit doing that, but it's also quite possible that over 3 ticks the mob won't get a riposte on you even without the skill.  And if it does riposte in the next 18 seconds, it may miss you anyway.  Or how about &quot;infuriate&quot;... 10% more aggro for 3 ticks... it's too short and too little % increase to help much.  &quot;Fortune&quot;... increase chance to critical by 20% for 3 ticks.  if I read that correctly, that means if you have a 5% chance to crit right now, 20% more of 5% gives you a whopping 6% chance to crit instead of 5 for 18 seconds.  10% chance becomes 12%, etc.  Wheeeee.... <br />
<br />
I hope these skills are either A) tuned to be a whole lot stronger than they appear to be right now or B) we get a hell of a lot of openings.<br />
<br />
&quot;Infallible&quot; has some potential if Furor's guess is right about what it does and if you can still keep aggro when it's active.  Mainly if you got lucky at the right time it could save your butt.  Since it relies on an opening though, you couldn't ever count on it.  <br />
<br />
Obviously the stun one has potential.  But most of these skills as they stand right now look extremely weak to the point of not being worth the effort of making all those hot keys and watching for openings constantly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Itzlegend</div><div class="date">12-07-2003, 02:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is far worse then you think.  Wait until you see the rate at which they occur.    10% aggro SOUNDS good until you actually go test it out and realise you're lucky to keep it up 25% of the time.<br />
<br />
Sorry but that isnt worth staring at the opening line.<br />
<br />
What makes matters far worse is that most of the players on test seem completely content with what is being dished out.  Ones complaints about flurry doing a WHOPPING 40 damage is responded with &quot;Oh no no, that is because you get that skill at low levels&quot;.<br />
<br />
A lot of the abilites are stuns and knockbacks etc which are completely useless, and the DD's are probably equilvenet to looting a single combat effects item.  Yet the players respond with &quot;thats kinda cool&quot; and &quot;hey better then nothing&quot;.  <br />
<br />
Granted I could be talking out of my ass.  I havent spent 1/10 of the time on beta furor and others have.  But while i was on, I sure didnt see ANYONE saying what needs to be said.  If you want to add diversity to melee with this system, the abilities HAVE TO MATTER.  The abilities have to be STRONG and very powerful.  Yes, indeed, they need to be OVERpowering for melee - or the system is wasted.   Let the casters catch up with the new spells in the next expansion - can't be more then a couple months away and they've been playing god for quite a while now.<br />
<br />
They need to stop being pussies and give these things some muscles.  Give monks and rogues a offensive opening &quot;Invigorating Blow&quot;.   This ability would heal them for 2,000 points of damage and cost 1/3 of their endurance.  Yes, that's right, a two thousand point heal.   Why not?  Don't we want to reduce the need to have 12 clerics in the next expansion?  Even in planes of power?  Hell make it a 3,000 point heal.   They use all of their endurance and they can match the defensiveness of a sliver of a clerics mana.<br />
<br />
Give rogues &quot;lifetap stance&quot; (you can come up with a better name im sure)  This ability would drain endurance at a rate of 1% per second and can be turned on and off.  While under the effects of lifetap stance rogues would lifetap their damage at a 33% ratio.<br />
<br />
Give monks &quot;heightened focus&quot;  Similar to lifetap stance this would drain endurance at a rate of 2% per second, and would give monks critical hits matching that of paladins versus undead mobs.<br />
<br />
Give warriors &quot;Rampaging frenzy&quot;  Drains 3% endurance per second .  Makes every melee round a frenzy, giving the warrior great dps versus multiple targets - but at a heavy endurance cost.  Limit 3-4 mobs per rampage.<br />
<br />
Etc. etc... <br />
<br />
Naturally you would slow down endurance regeneration with abilities like these around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Itzlegend</div><div class="date">12-07-2003, 02:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">in the right directions for adding utility to warriors.   <br />
<br />
Those of you who played camelot know what &quot;protect&quot; is.  Protect is a daoc tank ability that works as follows.  The warrior targets a cleric, or wizard and clicks protect.  From then on, until canceled, the warrior is &quot;protecting&quot; that person.  Basically the way it works, is the warrior consumes a certain % of the hate the person they are protecting gets.    <br />
<br />
So a warrior could &quot;protect&quot; a caster in the group, let them know, and that caster knew they could pump up the dps quite a bit - because the warrior was protecting them.   Basic idea here is simulating the warrior standing in front of that person and protecting them from harm.<br />
<br />
The warrior is contributing dps THROUGH the wizard.  They are teaming up.  Simple, yet brilliant.<br />
<br />
Rally cry is similar to that, but again still far underpowered to be bothered with in its current form.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aakla</div><div class="date">12-07-2003, 04:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK got me a system.<br />
<br />
change your Combat Keys to the 6 keys above your arrow keys, insert delete home end page up page down. then put the 6 combat skills you want there and 2 discs in the last 2 slots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EQSgmorris</div><div class="date">12-07-2003, 05:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah thanx for the info</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">12-07-2003, 05:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You realize that none of these abilities can be a major DPS thing because otherwise they'll just end up tuning down pure melee's DPS when other people complain we're doing too much damage and then you screwed those who would rather just auto-attack.<br />
<br />
The Cover ability is a lot like the protect thing, increase group mitigation by 20% while you decrease 20%.<br />
<br />
These skills are supposed to be our equivalent of 'utility'.  It's not supposed to be like 'I just did my super attack of doom, time to own.'  If pure damage is deemed inadequate it is easier to just fix the damage either through items or some innate modifier, and for the most part pure melee looks okay (Knights might be too close to Warriors but Monks/Rogues seem fine).  I have no idea how often they currently work but I know that if you can keep them up 100% of the time pretty soon people will be complaining how Warrior pay nothing to have Barrier/Infuriate/Cover up at all times or something along these lines.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grongl</div><div class="date">12-07-2003, 05:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've spent a LOT of time messing around with this stuff.  My take - the whole Openings system just flat out sucks.  You cannot even turn your head to check the score of the game on TV or you miss your opening enitrely.  Even then you have to decide what to use in less than 6 seconds.  The openings are way too infrequent to make any of the skills more than just an annoyance.  The fact that they block each other, and that provoke blocks them makes them even less useful.<br />
<br />
Provoke has potential, but not in its current form.  At 150 range it was nice for pulling and at 165 hate I could see it being alright for chaining, but at 100/100 it's pretty much useless.  100 is *inside* the aggro range of some things, and it's damn near inside the melee range of things like Bertox.  100 is CH range!  They need to either make a higher level version of it with better range and more initial hate and more dot hate (what is it now - 1/tick?) or just upgrade the whole thing and make it scale more with level.<br />
<br />
As for the rest of it - dump openings entirely.  Put the different skills into 3 categories - Offensive, Defensive, and Special, with 3 refresh timers.  And make the Endurance cost enough that you can't just keep firing off the best skill when the timer is up.  Make the free attack skillls *always* land.  Make the defensive skills not break disc.  Make Power Slam lvl 68 cap stun, but make it high endurance cost so it can't be used at will.  Make Head Bash at least a lvl 65 cap stun or give us another ability at higher level that's similar with a 65 cap so we can use it in LDoN and high level xp groups.  Totally ditch Barrier and Pain Tolerance and replace them with something useful - OR buff them way up (I'm talking 90pt DS, maybe a 900hp rune) and make them *stack* with the common buffs so they aren't completely useless.  Again, just make the endurance costs enough that we can't keep chaining this stuff all the time and/or give them refresh timers.  Just please, for the love of God, ditch the opening system.<br />
<br />
Don't turn us into the class equivalent of the lab monkey with wires in his brain who sits staring at the red light 18 hours a day waiting for it to flash green so he can push the button and get his slice of banana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Furor</div><div class="date">12-07-2003, 07:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">and I think it's something all of us that have been extensively testing these abilities agree on; their heart is in the right place but the system is currently not feasible for gameplay.<br />
<br />
To be honest, I don't want this rushed out on the 16th and end up with something that remains totally unused and laughed at as a gimmick.<br />
<br />
The system needs to be totally redone.<br />
<br />
They need to choose a cluster of abilities and just give them straight Endurance costs and refresh times. The whole idea of an opening, while nice, just doesn't work in a game like Everquest.<br />
<br />
Utility is defined by choice. With these abilities, choice is replaced by chance, utility is thus nullified and made into nothing more than a game of chance. <br />
<br />
My take on this is simple. <br />
<br />
13-14 abilities total. <br />
<br />
Level 20 - Provoke Level 1<br />
Level 30<br />
Level 40<br />
Level 50 - Provoke Level 2<br />
Level 52<br />
Level 55<br />
Level 57<br />
Level 60 - Provoke Level 3<br />
Level 61<br />
Level 62<br />
Level 63<br />
Level 64<br />
Level 65 x2 - Provoke Level 4 + Undecided Staple Ability<br />
<br />
Each ability having a refresh and an endurance cost. No opening system, period. The cost of each ability needs to be prohibitive enough so that it is entirely possible to go OOE during ONE fight, just as it is entirely possible to go OOM during ONE fight. After seeing what they can do with the Opening Abilities sytem, I know this is all totally possible. I also know that with the current rush, there is no way in hell anything like this can be ready by the 16th. It has to be postponed and this system reworked. I don't care how long it takes either. <br />
<br />
The question that has to be asked by the developers is this: What is the purpose of the Warrior class and why would *I* want to play one. The answer of 'because I'm necessary to advance,' is no longer a valid answer. Being necessary does not equate to being useful OR fun. This is a game, and the bottom line is, it needs to be fun. I know they are capable of accomplishing this because I can look at the Hybrid Tanks for reference. Paladins are FUN. Shadowknights are FUN. Warriors are NOT FUN. <br />
<br />
Imagine if you will, being a Paladin or Shadowknight, and the only time your spells were available to use were when a mob presented you with an opening. Sounds silly, right? Well, this is the same exact thing for Warriors. Without the choice of when and where to use these abilities, they are as useful as being able to cast spells only under certain conditions (openings) but with the added aggravation of being totally useless for the most part. For a Shadowknight, this is akin to receiving an opening to cast Lifedraw at level 65 with a successful bash trigger, and only within a time frame of 8 seconds. If you had no CHOICE, you may press the button of chance when it presented itself. Thankfully, you have a choice, and that choice means you will NEVER mem Lifedraw at level 65 and instead opt to use Touch of Innoruuk when and WHERE you needed, being prohibited by both mana and recast. Same concept folks. Time to apply.<br />
<br />
What I'd like to see is for people that have extensively tested the system to take the framework of 14 abilities at the levels I listed and come up with realistic abilities with realistic stamina costs and realistic reuse times. Take into account that the Warrior at level 65 has 5000 stamina points to distribute and that stamina regenerates at 50 stamina per tick (at level 65) resting (sitting) and 30 stamina per tick standing. *Note I just made those numbers up as a point of reference.</div></div><hr />

I can live with defensive discs being broken by using an offensive move.<br />
And an aggresive disc being broken by a defensive move.<br />
<br />
A defensive move while in defensive disc sounds ok to me, perhaps have some defensive abilities that only works while using a defensive disc. And vice versa with the offensive discs and abilities.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raaj</div><div class="date">12-07-2003, 02:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What I'd like to see is for people that have extensively tested the system to take the framework of 14 abilities at the levels I listed and come up with realistic abilities with realistic stamina costs and realistic reuse times. Take into account that the Warrior at level 65 has 5000 stamina points to distribute and that stamina regenerates at 50 stamina per tick (at level 65) resting (sitting) and 30 stamina per tick standing. *Note I just made those numbers up as a point of reference.<br />
<br />
Just off the top of my head while i'm eating breakfast...<br />
<br />
Level 20 - Provoke Level 1<br />
<br />
Level 30 - Shin Kick, but add a 50% snare. 2 ticks, and 30second cool down. 150 endurance cost.<br />
<br />
Level 40 - Berserker Frenzy...Forces yourself into a berserker frenzy for 3 ticks. 200 initial stamina + 50 upkeep.<br />
<br />
Level 50 - Provoke Level 2<br />
<br />
Level 52 - Barrier level 1: 31pt ds for 2 ticks, stacks with all. 300 initial + 150upkeep. AA to increase the duration . 1 minute recharge.<br />
<br />
Level 55 - Rally Cry level 1: Increases group melee damage by 10% for 2 ticks, additional aa's to add 3 additional ticks. 500 initial cost + 300 upkeep. 1 minute reuse.<br />
<br />
Level 57 -Combat Stance: +50% combat effects for 1 minute. 400initial cost + 150/tick upkeep. 2 minute recharge with an aa to bring it down.<br />
<br />
Level 60 - Provoke Level 3<br />
<br />
Level 61 - Power Slam 30 second re-charge, 500 stamina cost. 5 ticks @ 30 standing would bring this skill to a net cost of 100. If you sit afterwards there would be no cost.<br />
<br />
Level 62 - Barrier level 2: 60 point Damage shield, stacks with all. Lasts 3 ticks and aa's from barrier 1 work for it. 500 initial with 250 upkeep. 1 minute recharge.<br />
<br />
Level 63 - Rally Cry level 2: Increase group melee damage by 20% and spell damage by 10% for 2 ticks. The AA's from rally cry 1 would work on this. 500 initial + 350 upkeep. 1 minute recharge.<br />
<br />
Level 64 -Cover: increase group mitigation by 20%, lasting 3 ticks with an aa to add 3 additional ticks. 500 initial stamina + 300/tick upkeep. 1 min cooldown<br />
<br />
Level 65 - Provoke Level 4<br />
Level 65 - Divine Prayer - Divine intervention on the warrior for 2 ticks. AA to increase the probability. 750  endurance. 3 minute recharge.<br />
<br />
They can keep their gauntlet strikes and armor slices and whatnot on openings if they dont want to scrap that system altogether too.<br />
<br />
Along with these could be aa's to cut upkeep costs by 50% overall, etc. The system is literally limitless, it just needs to be used the right way. Keep in mind also, I think defensive/stonewall should drain 35% or so of our stamina throughout the duration...That means that we'd have to keep some stamina around or our disc isn't going to last the full time.</div></div><hr />

most of the time while running around we didn't even use it unless the caster got agro and taunt failed, but the caster gettting agro was rare as hell and normaly oinly happened when we asked him to try.</div></div><hr />

If they beef them up like they should all the knights will cry nerf, so instead of getting something useful we will just get a few toys that we can use once in a while.  From the testing I have done, it doesn;t seem like any of the changes will actually give me better tools to tank.  What I will get is another bar to watch and a few keys to push when i am bored.

There is lots of potential, but i seriously doubt we will see much.  All the palies of the land will cry, &quot;OH NOOOOOZZZ we be back to kunark!&quot;  So i don;t expect much from the changes now, especially after trying them for a while on test.  Horrible reuse timers, still waiting on the RNG,  and the one skill that had some promise (provoke) has already been reduced to useless.</div></div><hr />

Which is why the opening is mob-specific, and you never get defensive openings unless you are getting beat on.  But if the skills are done right, it shouldn't matter if you are tanking or not, they won't be overpowering.<br />

<br />
Not really.<br />
<br />
Give us a bigger selection of 'always on' abilities, like Healing Will and Bellow/Provoke and discs are.  These are our 'spells', and they will be analogous to the hybrid spells/AAs, with a few warrior-like twists to keep them unique.  A 'Purify Body' would be nice, as would a 'Pin' (short duration root), a 'Grapple' (short duration snare) and a 'Fumble' (make the mob miss next melee round/increase chance of openings for others).<br />
<br />
Then give us a selection of kick-ass combat moves, which can be used during combat openings (which need to last at least a tick, even with custom sounds and graphical icons).  Make 'em pretty beefy, since they will be both random and situational, make 'em scale by level, AND make them affected by the end-game melee 'foci' (strikethrough, combat effects, avoidance, etc....Your Earring of Xaoth Kor glows with an unearthly light...)<br />
<br />
Then give a smaller/weaker subset of just the combat moves to the hybrids.<br />
<br />
Problem solved.</div></div><hr />

Imagine if you will, being a Paladin or Shadowknight, and the only time your spells were available to use were when a mob presented you with an opening. Sounds silly, right? Well, this is the same exact thing for Warriors. Without the choice of when and where to use these abilities, they are as useful as being able to cast spells only under certain conditions (openings) but with the added aggravation of being totally useless for the most part. For a Shadowknight, this is akin to receiving an opening to cast Lifedraw at level 65 with a successful bash trigger, and only within a time frame of 8 seconds. If you had no CHOICE, you may press the button of chance when it presented itself. Thankfully, you have a choice, and that choice means you will NEVER mem Lifedraw at level 65 and instead opt to use Touch of Innoruuk when and WHERE you needed, being prohibited by both mana and recast. Same concept folks. Time to apply. <br />

<br />
Right now, they have endurance cost AND recast AND they rely on openings AND they're not particularly powerful when you can use them.<br />
<br />
In their current state, the endurance cost is completely trivial, to the point that there's not really any point in having it.  In the week since the abilities went live I have never been &quot;OOM&quot; or even close to it.  I can't use endurance fast enough to even put a dent in my bar.  Maybe it's different at lower levels, but it's more or less pointless right now for me.<br />
<br />
The warrior offensive abilities are beyond weak.  I have been using flurry and more often than not both extra hits miss, or if they do hit it's max of about 30-50 damage.  Kick easily outdamages the offensive abilites, and it's not much damage at all.  Infuriate is nice sometimes, but if you can't get it off at the beginning of the fight it's a waste.  <br />
<br />
I really like pain tolerance in exp groups but it is pretty trivial on raid mobs.  Infallible sounds promising when they get it working.  If it was 6 seconds of melee immunity it would be great.<br />
<br />
I love power slam.  Seeing mobs stand there doing nothing for 4 seconds rules.  Maybe I should have been a paladin.<br />
<br />
After a few days I kinda like the opening system.  With a little practice you know which button you're going to push when a given opening comes up and it's not hard to hit them most of the time.  It gives you something to watch for and makes playing more active.  I still miss a few but it's not really a big deal.  The audio cue would still be nice but the message in the chatbox is enough since I am usually watching that anyway.<br />
<br />
Provoke is promising, but it needs a power boost badly.<br />
<br />
I understand SOE is afraid to make these too powerful, but right now there is just too many restrictions and the abilites don't do enough.  They could make these either considerably more powerful or considerably more available without messing anything up right now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
From what I've heard from the people actually doing the testing it sounds like they need to either drastically increase the power of the skills or make them on demand skills just limited by the endurance bar and/or recycle timers.  Any utility we gain through these skills becomes completely unreliable if it's dependent on a random opening.  Might as well just add a &quot;random&quot; proc to our weapons that just randomly picks one of these new effects any time it procs.  The effect would be about the same except we wouldn't have to bother watching for that opening.<br />
<br />
For utility to be useful there has to be a degree of control over it.  If we have no control over it then it needs to be proportionally more powerful to make up for that fact.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't know for a fact, but I would guess that certain people who are in Beta or for some reason SOE felt would be good people to get feedback from were copied over to the LDoN beta server or maybe even test for the purpose of checking out the new system.  No clue how you get on this list, but Furor and Frodlin were certainly good choices.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anker steadfast</div><div class="date">12-08-2003, 06:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The truth is, that the test server do not have a large mid level crowd to test scaling with .. it has /testbuff level 25's and then mostly level 60+ people. Which isn't really the test people's fault.<br />
<br />
This whole system won't be tested to any depth until it hits live servers.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for the whole deal on wether or not a warrior should be based on the RNG or not, I think not. A warrior is supposed to be a corner stone of a group if he's in it, just like a Cleric is. But how can warrior be a corner stone only when there's an opening ?<br />
<br />
Most of the complaints for a good long time, have been that warriors have unreliable aggro and to some point, unreliable damage intake (ripostes from NPC) when dualwielding and I don't see much of a change in this, except the Provoke skill, small mitigation increase and unlinking of some discs - The group is by and large still left with the same problems.<br />
<br />
- If you dualwield, you may still die because of freak peak damage when a high level MOB ripostes.<br />
<br />
- Aggro is still based mostly (slightly better) on RNG from procs.<br />
<br />
- Warrior HP+mitigation is still less worth than comlpetely certain snap aggro by hybrids, when MOB arrives in camp.<br />
<br />
<br />
As has been said before :<br />
 &quot;I don't want more options, I want better choices.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
   Seems like you burn a opening that way, to me.<br />
they should have some sort of defensive opening you can take advantage of at the lower levels, or why would your character even recognize there was a defensive opening?<br />
<br />
   So far with my limited  testing  Provoke and the bellows are the only skills worth a crap. Gnollhide lariats give you a better chance/longer duration of stun then a head bash at the lower levels.<br />
 <br />
   I am not 100% certain but I believe while doing a backslash I missed.  I will have to look through the log again, but I swear I missed. which would mean these random openings  can be resisted of a sorts, if they do a skill check rather then just hit dead on  when you use them.<br />
<br />
   One question that I do have that I can't not  fathom, can your offhand  create openings? if so then there is a little more incentive to duel wield. It would also be nice to know  on account  that  your some of the opening abilities  do a base damage(multiplier for lack of a better word) then the offhand weapon ratio would seem to be very important. Especially if the openings are based off of delay like they  talked about in the chat. maybe the best ratio  off hand weapon is not the best choice now days.<br />
<br />
   Has anyone had the chance to test them in a PVP situation?<br />
I would like to know if  these new abilities have a range  while jousting. Tried it with a friend earlier tonight for a short time and could not get a opening while jousting.<br />

And yet they weren't afraid to buff knight classes all to hell and create our current situation of uselessness.  Huh... why is that, do you suppose?  <br />
<br />
I've always suspected Sony of paying too much attention to their numbers on what percent of people play each class.  An underplayed class like knights have always been got buffed like mad when Sony finally decided to help them out.  It seems like they've been far from cautious about the repeated boosts.  But with warriors they'll still look at us and think, &quot;lots of people play warriors, so they must be okay.&quot;  <br />
<br />
The truth is that lots of people play them because it takes so damn long for most of us to level up and AA a good character that we're not about to do it again.  We're too attached to our current character no matter how gimp Sony makes it.  Since warriors use to be good, a lot of people still play warriors.  The other thing is you'll always have fewer knights because of things like the &quot;WTF is a shadowknight?&quot; syndrome.  Many people play what sounds familiar to them and nothing is more familiar than &quot;warrior&quot;.  <br />
<br />
anyway, I'm off topic.  I'm just sick of the crap Sony shovels us and I can't believe how gimp this new system is looking.</div></div><hr />

Yes they are working. Remember the Error opening is a function of the zone. That means they have to activate it in the zone. Chardok probably wasn't activated for them. They workin Pofire though.</div></div><hr />

If it's deemed Warriors still do not have enough utility just increase our DPS by 30% and then no one would care we don't have much utility.  <br />
<br />
The point of the new melee system is not to break the game as they once did with Knights.  Perhaps some day they'll even fix the Knights back to where they're supposed to be but saying 'he's broken so why am I not?' just doesn't work.</div></div><hr />

Ran a 1-hour log on Rinna Lightshadow in EC today to test opening rate.<br />
<br />
38 Offensive<br />
40 Defensive<br />
31 Special Skill<br />
0   Error (guess EC not flipped on for Error Openings either)<br />
<br />
Notes:<br />
<br />
Offensive + Defensive + Special with constant combat and special skill refresh would seem to add up to 120 in an hour, or 2/min like normal proc rate.<br />
<br />
Had to reposition her a couple times and redo a couple buffs.  Would account for Offensive being lower than Defensive.<br />
<br />
Wasn't religiously mashing kick every time it came up, cause, well I had tv to watch and coffee to drink.  Guessing if I had it would be ~40 Specials as well.<br />
<br />
Rinna avoided/resisted all my attack type skills, some mobs can just be immune to them, regardless of level.<br />
<br />
<br />
p.s. I still think the whole Openings system is a pain in the ass and I still feel like the lab monkey pushing the button at the green light for my slice of banana.  Provoke line is great though and new discs have huge potential to make being a War more fun.</div></div><hr />

Then you can add some more wizbang opening stuff for fun and give some of those to hybrids too.  <br />

In other words - Fix warriors with some reliable, use-when-you want/need skills as one task.<br />

<br />
Skills, Abilities, and AA Abilities do not really provide for spell-like capability. In the past, this has been provided by procs and right-click items.<br />
<br />
The openings feature allows SoE to give Warriors many proc-like &quot;spells&quot;.<br />
<br />
I personally don't like the dancing-star powerup aspect of this feature. While most people believe playing a Warrior is too simple, I find it pretty challenging especially in raids. There is more than enough data that I'm keeping an eye on and reacting to.<br />
<br />
So, if this opening system is intrusive and demands constant attention and quick reaction, I'm going to be pretty disappointed. If it displays a random opprotunity with ample time to use it or not, then fine - a nice addition.<br />

<br />
Why put it in if it doesn't make enough difference to matter?  If the opening system is part of the &quot;balance solution&quot; for warriors then it should actually make a difference.  If the effects are minor then they should be on demand so we can use them when we need them.  If they're just going to go off randomly then they should be powerful enough that other people in the group notice the effect.  Like a 10 second stun or a 5-8k crit.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yalp Bungabunga</div><div class="date">12-17-2003, 01:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's the reality I have faced as a warrior for last 4 years SOE. I don't give a damn about how you want your game to work or who's f***ing world you believe EQ is. I am sick and tired of being the EQ bitch even at level 65 with 200+ aa's in a ele planes guild. But lets start with some obvious misconceptions.  EQ is not an online roleplaying game .. or an interesting hobby. Its a f***ing full time job. Let me explain plainly , if you don't play EQ 40+ hours a week you cannot keep up .. don't understand yet? Let me run you through what a warrior has to do in order to keep up in a guild. <br />
<br />
Mandatory for warrior in ele planes level guild.<br />
<br />
Level 65 .. this took me about 3 years because if you don't make the crest of the best the first time around you have to wait a long f***ing time to prove yourself again, and GL leveling in velious like so many non guilded wariros had to.<br />
<br />
150+ aa's  .. if you don't have Ae taunt, Ambi, ND3, PD3, maxed charisma, PE, CA3, CS3, ID5, LR5, HI3, PB3 .. that covers the basics folks anything less makes your job a lot harder.<br />
<br />
Now .. you need to go farm about 123462345 pp to cover yor weekly battery costs and arrows and time to get a shaman to make quintessence crap so you can gate. this is of course AFTER you actually are in an ele planes guild that is willing to help you farm for the 20+ item you need to get this rediculously high cost gate gear... gem costs to keep your clerics / druids happy .. and another 12345365 pp to cover your 50 hp food cost.<br />
<br />
now ldon .. farm 9 charisma augments .. water breathing and angerIII theres another 3 months of extra time in the crapper for nearly 0 personal benefits. Sorry but 60% of an aa is a crock of @#$4 for about 2 hours that it takes to form and motivate a group to do an adventure. (Prolly moreso on avg like 3 hours.)<br />
<br />
flags .. that one just speaks for itself .. you don't play all the time your fuxxored.<br />
<br />
VT key theres another month spent pre ele planes to keep up. You wanna hear an entire guild bitch everyday? <br />
<br />
Then of course you have to farm for that fooking wood elf illusion crown so you can tank in corners. theres another full week of farming so you can do your job while looking like a gay ass wood elf. I colored my warrior red and green because this is such a !@#$ing joke.<br />
<br />
And how many of you warriors spent weeks begging for friends to help you farm for jboots pre luclin, just so you didn't have to die in every !@#%#$!%!#$damn zone? i spent about 2 solid weeks trying to get them myself. No luclin didn't have anything good to talk about .. sorry nice try. Only thing that entire expansion had to offer warriors was run speed 3.<br />
<br />
Now lets talk the grand tamalie .. the most fooking disturbing BS of them all. mandatory taunt weapons. ... lemme see . F*** YOU SOE. F*** YOU F*** YOU F*** YOOOOOUUUUUUUUUUU!<br />
<br />
Ok now I can calmly talk about this with going into convultions....<br />
<br />
The fact that without taunt weapons we are on par with shaman pets dps wise and ability and even with them eq gimps. Don't understand why were upset? I know its hard to conceptionalize, but try this imagine your playing a video game with a broken controller and one of the buttons is fried. And not only that your friend came over and slammed that controler on the wall with all his might to purposely break it so it didn't work, because he said it was unfair. Thats metaphorically an approximation what playing this game as a warrior is like post 45th level. Try playing a warrior for 6 months F***ers in a guild any guild ANY GUILD.<br />
<br />
Now if youre intent on playing a warrior and like the abuse, youre still gonna have to get one of these weapons. Myself personally it took me four @#$!@#$ years to get one, i was last in my class to recieve one. I wouldn't wish this hell on anyone. I gave up and did other things with my life several times this sucked so bad, EVEN after making it into a l33t guild you are by no means guaranteed a weapon to do your job.. so you can tank .. get exp .. do @!#$!@ing mandatory quests for your class do boring ass ldon farm mfor keys and money or and did i forget banes .. have fun running your ass off around eq world trying to level up you smithing to 220+ as a warrior with on par the weakest dps in the game.<br />
<br />
Did you know that the warrior class is the only class in the game that CANT CORPSE RUN IN PERMAFROST? I t doesn't matter how many aa's or how geared you are. 65 warrior with 592 aa's = 35th level mob without gear. Do you even realise this soe?<br />
<br />
Now back to taunt weapons ..<br />
<br />
Why is it that warriros who are one of the 3 most dependant classes in the game have by far and large the hardests quests in the game .. is this suspose to be some joke about class balance? ..lemme ask this have you ever tried to convince your guild its time to get a taunt weapon for you so you can play guild bitch? Assist to kill blah blah blah ..<br />
<br />
No I'm sorry but guess what most guilds farm a couple so they can get to next level of game, when the warrior at the bottom of the barrel gets his golden blade of taunt its usually when the normal ma  has already gotten his next upgrade. This is normal for every class but guess what every class doesn't absolutle depend on having a weapon to tank for 50+ people on any given night and get exp groups. Its called the trickle down theory and its the only functionable way to run a guild .. or didn't you know that SOE? Sheet, its so fun being a warrior I remember one time a GM came and depopped cursed because of a server down after my guild set up to kill it because it would have been exploitation of your precious ass game, because it was already killed by the euro players you cater to.<br />
<br />
I personally started a warrior because I wanted to play a conan like character, what i got was a kilt wearing, sheep herder. We're F***ing clown shoes on a tight wire.<br />
<br />
And now after 12 months of &quot;were thinking about maybe possibly trying something new next new year to possibly  maybe balance pure melee&quot; we get ... wait for it .. wait for it .. wait forit .. NOW .. hit the 100 taunt discipline key .. now hit the stun key .. now hit the taunt key .. now hit the stun key..... just f***ing die SOE. Get run over by a gas truck and taste your own blood.<br />

<br />
I have a level 59 warrior and my main gripe is having basically any class able to steal agro from me....I hate it when I have to yell at a bard to give me agro =/.  So I decided to test the new agro keys.  I was grouped with an SK, Monk, Paly, Shammy and Cleric  in PoI and asked them not to cast any spells that could pull agro away.  I engaged the mob first and started taunting, kicking, and using Berate to gain agro.  At 90% the rest engaged and guess what happened??  I lost agro as soon as they attacked.  I was hasted as well and thought I was doing some decent damage, being that duel weilding seems to allow me to keep agro better.  Even after the 1 minute reuse time of allowing me to click Berate over and over again during the fight, I felt that there was no real difference from pre-patch.  Oh and the message said something like &quot;You utter profanities at the mob&quot; and then he got angry at me...still didnt pull agro tho.  Heck, I coulda yelled profanities all this time with the same effect without the new ability!<br />
<br />
Ahh, and I was a bit upset that I had to go and buy those stupid tomes just to get my discs back again.  I felt that I had EARNED them after all these months of leveling and working my butt off just to level to 59.  <br />
<br />
I love all the input that everyone has posted, and even though I haven't reached the level that Yalp has, I do understand where he is coming from.  My main is a bard and I feel that she is WAY more beneficial to a group than my warrior is.  Her dps, when contributing to the group as a whole (adding the combined increase of dps and decreased PC damage taken) with her hastes, damage shields, and dots, as well as all her regen capabilities, makes her a much more sought after class than my warrior.<br />
<br />
What I would like to see happen with the warrior class is just to be the reliable meat-shield we were meant to be.  We cant do that if we cant hold agro.  Perhaps SOE should come out with new gear that can enable us to do so.  My personal dream item is a pair of boots that proc an uber hate called &quot;Asskickers&quot; that would be totally unresistable when it procs.  That combined with taunt and other hate procing weapons would help out alot.  I'm not asking for 100% agro, just enough ability to be able to make a more significant contribution to groups as a whole.<br />
<br />
Another addition to warriors that I would like to see is a better epic.  Im in the process of getting mine because I just wanna look kewl with the light sabers, but everyone has told me that there is way better gear out there, especially from the elemental planes.  Maybe there could be a second half to the epic....with the same amount of work as the original, where you can gather more stuff from higher planes, turn them in with the epic to the quest NPC and get an upgraded epic.  For diversity there can be several quests you can choose from (but only one upgrade) that can range between different abilities like hate, procs, or stat increases.  However I wont hold my breath on that one lol.<br />
<br />
This is just my 2cp.  I love playing my warrior, if I didnt I wouldnt have played her as much as I have.  I'm just sick and tired of &quot;bootie smackin&quot; cause all I see are mob arses during fights.  If I wanted to do that all the time I would have made a rogue :).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Er, those disc's cost 2 copper each.... roughly the cost of your last post =p  (&quot;This is just my 2cp. I love playing my...&quot;)<br />
<br />
Now, the part about the patch sucking hard I will agree with. I pulled with Incite, and the MOB went straight for the bard every time. Not really sure if it is just broken at range, like SK hate spells, or just broken, but was NOT giving 400 hate, that is for sure.<br />
<br />
Most of my other discs did not do anything either, exxcept healing will, which was very effective at emptying my stamina pool.<br />

Endurance costs, if adjusted correctly, should be enough of a mitigating factor to prevent people from chaining abilities.</div></div><hr />

Basically UP the usefullness of the abilities but keep the need to be at the keyboard being active in the result of the useful effect.</div></div><hr />

The only thing not &quot;fun&quot; about playing a warrior was being lvl 65, 200AAs, whipping dual-EB weapons, and still losing aggro to a lvl 40 SK casting a gimp-ass lvl20 snare spell.</div></div><hr />

You don't pay for the same old disc.<br />
<br />
You pay for the new and improved discs that has somewhat unlinked timers. I am sure everyone here would pay some pp for this ability.</div></div><hr />

If so,  how do i get the abilities to show up so I can use them? In other words are they be used via Hot key's like the Disciplines or what?  Just curious..<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance..</div></div><hr />

He is on the second floor I think. Purchase the tomes you want then turn them into the WGM in POK to activate them. Right now only the new disc and provoke line are live.</div></div><hr />

Can anyone point me to a listing of the numbers for the new discs in an /alt activate command so I can make hotkeys for them?<br />

This of course assuming you have already turned the Tomes into the GL.  Just another way of  accomplishing the same thing i guess )  ..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Default is CTRL + (1-8) corresponding to the buttons in the Comabat Abilities Window, as with the spell gems and the ALT key.  Disciplines are still responsive to the command line, but all lower case (unless this has been corrected recently).  Otherwise, it's the same as it ever was (/disc defensive, etc; abbreviated as you see fit).  I generally just type my discs in, tho I have evasive and furious hot-key'ed just in case.</div></div><hr />

Not that I disagree with them, their reasons are the same arguments we made here against the opening system. What they have in mind as a replacement is also what we asked for - solid, non-twitch based abilities. Hopefully some good stuff makes its way out of this mess.<br />

As for this thread... shut her down, she's now officially worthless.</div></div><hr />
