<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vegalord65</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Got a greatstaff of the four winds the other night, and a cord hilted spike driver tonight. <br />
<br />
Would a CHSD and CHoS produce more agro than the staff? Thinking about usin the staff just for DPS on raids, but i'm curious as to which is better agro. Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>yagru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">2 agro procs would be beter then one not-so-good-agro proc.<br />
<br />
Altho the higher dps will get the mobs attention faster, you will not be able to hold agro for a long time without much taunting / incite chaining..<br />
<br />
So go for the 2 one handers unless you get riposted into the ground ( which normally won't be the case in xp group settings and most raid targets i have seen ).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You'll find the GSO4W is better aggro early in fights, and might hold aggro through early slow where your dual wield does not.  Therefore the staff might be preferable in places where mobs die super-fast, such as easy LDON.  For any fight that takes a minute or more, you'll want the aggro procs from your dual wield.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">/agree Sassinak. I find in normal ldons, or anywhere else where the fights are short and the mobs damage output is low, my lifetapped GSo4W is superior to dual wield, just because I get the same aggro, every time. I also do more DPS, and losing aggro really isn't a big deal.<br />
<br />
In long fights you'll have to taunt aggro back all the way to the end, however, vs with a dual wield combo after a few procs you should have aggro locked down nicely. Keep 'em both.</div></div><hr />

Perfectly stated.  Shorter fights (ie LDoN normals etc.) or ones where ripostes would HURT (slow, hard-hitting mobs like the Weaponmaster in GoD because I can't think of a better example) should work well with your Greatstaff. Your one-handers should be used when you're tanking a raid or have a mini-boss (BoT wing bosses for example) as you can lose agro early on during slows and snares. Find a happy medium and it works well!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't the GSo4W proc a DD?  If that is the case it isn't an aggro weapon, it's a DPS weapon.  It may be good enough DPS to hold aggro with in some situations (ala Windblades early in PoP), but the only way I'd call it an aggro weapon is if you anger aug it.  Personally, it makes me cringe when someone anger aug's a DPS weapon, but if you don't have better it works.  As has been stated previously, dual wielding the CHoS and CHSD will be better aggro in the long run, especially if they're aug'd with anger III, but for shorter fights, you may be able to get away with a DPS weapon. (and I've had plenty of monks pull aggro off me using an unaug'd GSo4W)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">There have already been threads about this.  After the first few procs, aggro proccing weapons pull away and are of course superior.  But over the short term (i.e. when the number of procs is zero or small), DPS weapons with high damage bonuses have superior aggro to low DPS or low damage bonus weapons.  In an LDON where mobs die in 30-45 seconds, different weapons work well compared to what you'd choose for 3-15 minute fights.</div></div><hr />
