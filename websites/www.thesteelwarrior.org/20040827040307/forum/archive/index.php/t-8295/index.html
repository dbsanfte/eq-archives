<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Boub</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I played a bit with it, trying to find a warrior talent template I like, but I found several problems:<br />
<br />
Some talents have too harsh requirements (like having spent 25 pts in that area already): forcing you to buy stuff you dont want to get something you do want<br />
<br />
Since I am not in beta, I am wondering if I say get axe crits, if those stack with crits for 2h weapons, I would say yes if its a 2h axe.<br />
<br />
Is the 5 TP for 50 ac worth it ? I think not I ve seen some items with 200+ AC (some shield I saw on a thotbott profile thingie)<br />
<br />
I have also no idea how effective the 5 pts defense upgrade is, I guess it influences avoidance ?<br />
<br />
Going 2h seems to not support getting the best (?) defensive talent (the percentual hp short time increaser) , you have to buy worthless shield talents to unlock it, unfair.<br />
<br />
The Fury area seems to be of split nature, with a lot of dubious shout enhancers / abilities and straight up dps enhancers, again you need to buy things you might not want to unlock wanted things. Or in worst case you dont have the points to spend on unneeded stuff to get to the good things.<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
Conclusion:<br />
<br />
- I hope they add more talents or at least more talentpoints<br />
<br />
- more path choices<br />
<br />
- need to drop some of the requirements<br />
<br />
- make some talents more effective (AC bonus one comes to mind, maybe I am wrong tho)<br />
<br />
- I need beta access to do extensive testing !<br />
<br />
<br />
more thoughts:<br />
<br />
Warriors are THE tank in WoW, and expected to tank, therefore in grps / raids maximum defensive / taunt ability is desired, yet if you get that you cripple your self soo much that you can barely dent the fury and arms talent trees, thats sad I wanna have some fun too - big hits / extras</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">yep, they should either give more TP or make somthing like D2, only 1TP needed per skill to unlock greater skill ; and of course make some synergies !!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gorlab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'll know more after talent wipes go in so I can try out all the talent trees but so far here are my impressions.<br />
<br />
Protection tree is not &quot;needed&quot; but then again the end game isn't in yet.  Prot warriors do tank noticably better than non prot spec'd warriors.  I full expect to want 25-30 points in here on release.<br />
<br />
Arms has many people excited but really its not that great IMO.  I am in the minority here mind you!  Mortal Strike is currently overpowered and the concensus even among warriors is that it needs and will get the nerf bat.  If you ignore that ability then tactical mastery is about the main thing in arms and that requires 20pts + 5 in it to max it.  However if you look at the 20 points you spend to get its prereqs they suck.  <br />
You can spend 5 in a weapon spec which isn't bad. <br />
Improved strike &amp; rend are 6 points together, but only in battle stance.  You spend most of your group time in defensive stance (unless you're crazy which many warriors are).  So you could swap to battle in order to rend the mob and swap back but is it worth 6 talent?  <br />
Charge gives more rage but you really dont use this terribly much in instances and its only the 1st mob even when you do use it.<br />
Hamstring is plenty slow enough so no need to up it...maybe for PvP but Im a PvE'er so I don't care about that. <br />
Thunderclap is a junk skill atm, and spending talent to raise the damage still wouldn't make it useable.<br />
Adding daze (basically snare) to pummel is useless as you have hamstring (real snare) in that stance and you use pummel to interrupt spells.<br />
So with all that said and done you end up spending talent points in areas that aren't terribly good at all in order to get TM...the main use of which is ability to snare in defensive stance.  I'd rather save the points and have someone else snare!<br />
<br />
Fury now is quite good, unbridled wrath is my favorite talent of all ... it doesn't seem like much but it really does up your rage generation a lot...in all stances.  Enrage, flurry, cruelty all up your dps nicely in all stances.  And demoralizing is a nice shout again for all stances.  So I'm currently leaning towards 25 points in fury and the rest in protection on release.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">could you remind me the specificity of Beserk stance (at which lvl we get it, and what skills are in it), because I still didn't get a mail with a CD key in it :mad: and the web page seams to speak about only the two other. so it's nice to see all the three talent tree but I still don't fully see the three stence...<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Yoda.</div></div><hr />
