<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gunrack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I posted this on a site that was &quot;supposedly&quot; to help create websites and such but I decided that since some of you helped with this site here and some of your own guilds maybe I could get some extra help.  I will paste here what I posted on the other site since it will convey the idea.  There are some questions that ask if this forum is correct for this question of course those don't apply to here but just wanted some of you knowledgeable folks in this area to get the idea of my problem.<br />
<br />
I need help on quite a bit of stuff but before I start posting here I would like to know.  Are these forums specific to business types?  Basically my website is not business but more of a &quot;showcase?&quot;.  We are a group of people that do different things and I want to have a website about it.<br />
<br />
We play online games, tabletop games, have family gatherings etc... <br />
<br />
On top of all that I am very much (at least I consider myself) a beginner in website development/planning/structure etc... <br />
<br />
So, is there a better place to ask my questions?  Or are these forums ok for that?  If these forums are okay my questions are insanely numerous and all I seek are opinions and some knowledge.  I am able to do some quick learning &amp; research if necessary but everything is SO overwhelming that I do not even know where to begin (at least overwhelming when I think of the grandscheme of things).  I've considered using Java Script for drop down menus, considered changing the whole site to Vbulletin, PHP etc... problem is I don't know these languages their advantages PHP?  Is this a database?  I have taken tutorials and I still have yet to find something defining why this language would be more efficient due to ?  or because of?<br />
<br />
Some questions I have are:<br />
<br />
What is the BEST/Most Efficient Language/technology to do a site of my type?<br />
<br />
Is this just a preference?<br />
<br />
I do use frames and I do see many posts here on how people hate em, what are alternatives to achieve what I want?<br />
<br />
Am I using the best easiest most efficient method for navigation?  What are the alternatives to what I do?<br />
<br />
Like I said my questions are numerous.  I'll take a redirection or any help I can use.  Also having feedback as changes are done would be nice so if anyone knows of a place where I can achieve that (my friends sometimes aren't much help) let me know.  Here the my site address that I have currently incase I posted this in the right spot if I need to move it just le tme know and it will be done.<br />

Well met Gunrack.<br />
<br />
Alot of what you are asking is kinda a personal preference.  It really all depends on what you know and what you dont.  Do you have the time to learn code outside of what you already know?  Does the &quot;purpose&quot; and &quot;need&quot; of your site allow for on-the-fly learning?  These questions only you can answer really.<br />
<br />
Personally I started coding webpages using Notepad.  Nowadays that is terribly ineffecient.  However, it gave me a strong background in hand-coding and that is a great benefit to have in the world of WYSIWG editors. <br />
<br />
Of those types of editors, i have used 2, FrontPage and Dreamweaver.  <br />
<br />
All I am going to say is this I HATE FrontPage.  To me Frontpage is a glorified Word program.  This is great for beginners I feel .... but very lackluster for the professional.  IMO, Dreamweaver is the way to go.  <br />
<br />
Ok -- so we have your editor established, now lets move onto server/language technologies.  This again is a personal preference. <br />
<br />
Until Recently I always used Javascript and HTML.  That was it.  For what I was doing i did not need anything else.  Nowadays I am learning ASP, PhP and XML (although barely :)).<br />
<br />
As I can only speak for myself, if the site you are designing allows for you to experiment with anything that you are not used to, then by all means go ahead and give them a shot.  There is nothing like figuring things out by experimenting.  Also, trying to use server/languages that you have not used before on a real project is the best way to learn.  <br />
<br />
Up until recently I never needed database oriented content for webpages I worked on.  Now I do.  However, the server that will be working with is IIS (microsoft) and therefore I will be using ASP technologies.  If I could I would like to try PhP also.  However Php is mainly used on Apache (linux/Unix) servers, and I dont have access to one atm.<br />
<br />
So, if ya wanted to mess with ASP/PhP you gotta know what your server allows and that will help with your decision.  Oh forgot to mention, ASP/PhP is the method of HOW the client communicates to a database located on the server.  So both of these languages require a database (Access and MySQL are the most popular) to be located on the server, but the type of server determines what language to use.<br />
<br />
OK ...  lets move onto frames or noframes.<br />
<br />
I have always had the moto of &quot;Simple Elegance&quot;TM  when it comes to page design.  So I try to keep things as effeciently driven as possible.  However, sometimes the client does not care about effeciency OR the subject of the site does not require effeciency, and in those cases, go crazy :)  Also, effeciency does not have to mean things look boring or canned.  I can make a site that looks great .. pleasing to the eye, downloads fast, navigates easily ... all while staying effecient.  I can also do the opposite if needs warrant them ... but I will stick to effeciency if at all possible.<br />
<br />
Back to frames :) ... Again personal choice.  I will always try to stay away from them if at all possible.  Frames, although easy enough to manage with software like Dreamweaver, can get complicated and I try to keep everything as simple as possible.  You can acheive frame usebility and not use frames by taking advantage of library items and table setups in Dreamweaver (this is not by any means a Dreamweaver oriented idea and in fact can be applied to whatever editor you choose, its more of a ideaology then a software capability FYI, although some software helps more then others :) ). <br />
<br />
Also, since this is on the same subject ... try to think of your pages and the way you navigate them in a modular way.  Meaning, down the road when your site has exceeded more pages that you can easily handle, how hard would it be to change site navigation across all of those pages?  Using libraries and other &quot;such&quot; thinking can make life easy when dealing with webpage maintenance.  For example, by using libraries I can easily change navigation of 5000 pages just by changing one library item.  (Frames can do this too -- but personally I dont like them).<br />
<br />
On the same note .. I also try to stay away from drop-down menus and other fancy coding.  Like i said before ... there are places for these types of navigation to be used ... but I try to stay away from them if at all possible.<br />
<br />
For me, embedded tables are the way to go for layout of any site.  Graphics, navigation, anything and everything, can be organized with clever use of tables.  With tables there does not have to be use of frames, drop-downs, radio buttons, etc. for navigation.<br />
<br />
Well I hope I answered all of your questions.  I am sure you will have alot more of them.  As I said before, these are some of my preferences.  I am sure others will agree with me on some things and flame me for others :).<br />
<br />
Basically it comes down to this:<br />
<br />
1. Use what you know.<br />
2. If site allows for it, experiment (great way to learn).<br />
3. Keep things simple, allows for easier maintenance in the long run.<br />
4. Modularity is your best friend.<br />
<br />
Come to think of it ... I probably am over-complicating this if your only considering web designs around EQ/Guild oriented material.  However ... it will go a long way in helping that too.<br />
<br />
Good luck and have fun.<br />
<br />

p.s For what its worth .. I clicked around the site link you posted and I dont see anything wrong with it.   Looks great, navigates easily and is very functional for its purpose.  Of course I would change some things (ahem *cough* frames *cough*) ... but thats just me.  If the site is working fine, then perhaps the saying &quot;If it ain't broke, don't fix it&quot; applies. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Nested tables are teh win.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ealsur Helevorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If I had to choose a HTML designing tool, Dreamweaver is the best imo.<br />
<br />
I've been using all Macromedia products (Fireworks, Flash, Dreamweaver), and recently started working and learning ASP. Its incredible the kind of things you can do, and how much easier is to update a database than adding tons of HTML pages hehe.<br />
<br />
Reedok did a great post, try to follow his advice :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gunrack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks a lot for all your advice guys!  I actually was able to reap &quot;some&quot; information out of that &quot;other site&quot; I posted this question on.  I did come to some conclusions but I would like to post here one of my final thoughts because its been about 48 hours and I have not gotten a response.  Maybe I will get one on this topic.<br />
<br />
Here is the snippet:  Notice the &quot;dream&quot; part.  I do not know much about web programing tools etc.. so if you guys know of something that acts this way please let me know.<br />
<br />
EDIT:  The reason I added this little snippet is because someone mentioned Database updating... sounds like my little dream but I do not know how it works if someone knows and could explain in lame terms?  BTW the host we are going to be moving supports both ASP and PHP but I've been told PHP is the way to go since ASP will be moving to ASP .NET stuff soon.<br />
<br />
OK, thanks all for participating and helping me out! Site Planning and Preparation stage I think is complete. My website is basically about 10 pages of which 4 are updated weekly. I am going to take out the frames since I realized that I am still technically updating 4 pages no matter how I look at it. As far as I've seen I don't see that my website &quot;needs&quot; me to know any other language aside from what I already &quot;semi&quot; know. HTML/CSS and a bit of Java scripting (even this one is not necessary but I use it to add flavor like I added falling snow on the website for Xmas). <br />
<br />
There is one more thing that I had in mind for the &quot;future&quot;. And I use that term losely because I am not sure. I am about to use what I call Guillius speech which means I am going to make up what I think things are called just to convey the point. I always &quot;dreamed&quot; that when I had a website I was going have &quot;core pages&quot; first. Basically I would build all my pages how they were going to look and everything but no actual text or data. Then that I would be able to update ALL pages with ONE file. Example I have 10 pages. I only have to update pages 2 and 4. I would go to this ONE file to &quot;section page 2&quot; and add my update (in which ever language or simply normal text that the &quot;core pages&quot; could read and out put them to the viewer. Then I would go to &quot;section page 4&quot; and update that and it would automatically update pages 2 and 4. My question before I move on from this part of these forums is. <br />
<br />
Is this &quot;dream&quot; of mine possible? If so, what is it really called? Is it exactly what I am &quot;thinking/dreaming&quot;? Is it similar enough? <br />
<br />
I guess I can answer most of those questions for myself if I find out there is such a thing in the first place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Reedok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Gunrack -<br />
<br />
The 'Dream&quot; you are talking about is very much possible.  Its the modularity thinking that can help achieve.<br />
<br />
Like i mentioned before, you can do this is notepad, but use Dreamweaver it can make things million times easier.<br />
<br />
Let me say first that I am glad you realized what you needed and that using what you know already is plenty to get you through.  Often times I see grandiose ideas that are far out of reach of some people.  On the same note ... many times they can do what they are trying to do --- just takes a little &quot;outside of the box&quot; thinking.<br />
<br />
In any case, what you are dreaming about is referred to as  &quot;libraries&quot; in dreamweaver.  You can create a library item (which can be anything; i.e. text, pics, flash, etc.) and then insert that item to any location on any pages that you wish.  Then, when updates are necessary all you do is make changes to the library item and its gets changed on ALL pages that the library item exists on.  WEEEeeeee....  its fun!! :D<br />
<br />
Personally I make library items for the constant things throughout the site that might need drastic changing.  For example ... you can make a library item (I do this all the time) for your site's main navigation.  Stick it on all pages (and make templates for super-easy page creation) and voila ..... page navigation across 5000 pages can be fixed/updated just by correcting the library item (I seem to like this example :P ).<br />
<br />
You can also make library items for footer info ... quotes of the day ... damn near anything really.  Its the modularity of library items that makes them supreme.  With some slick thinking you can use them in alll kinds of ways.<br />
<br />
You should pick up a trial version of Dreamweaver (along with all the other Macromedia products) and try em out.  I bet you will love it as much as we do :P<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gunrack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks for all the advice.  I am surprised that I have not mentioned this but I actually have and use Dreamweaver MX version 6.0.  Hopefully this version has &quot;libraries&quot;.  <br />
<br />
Well, I guess its time for me to go search out some library tutorials.  Again thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yeah, that dream is absolutely possible. Templates and style sheets are the bread and butter of a good HTML writer. In my experiences another good developer application to use is Coffeecup.<br />
<br />
Oh, and don't be afraid to surf the net and look at what other people have done. If you like something, do a view source and see how they did it. Experimenting and seeing how things work in a practical application make the learning process a lot easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gunrack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Woot site complete.. kinda cheated and used nuke but oh well.. anyone wanna look have at it<br />
