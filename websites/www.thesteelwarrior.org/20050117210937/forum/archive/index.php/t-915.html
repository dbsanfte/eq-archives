When I first started my WE Warrior (I'm a Barb now) I gave him a Centi SS and Shaded Blade (12/24), then I swapped to the Shaded and a Wurmslayer, that was a nice combo for quick kills (critting for over 100 at level 20 got some oohs and aaahs lol) Now i'm going through the same thing, trying to decide what to use (was told Long Sword of Ethereal Energy but I'm Maelin, and the only ones here were brought with transfers and they are going for like 20k) Right now I'm using JBoM and Defiance for the DEX and Speed (combined 18 DEX I think good for skillups so I hear)<br />
<br />
I also find myself using 2hs a lot (skill is higher than my 1hs too) but it's kinda useless to use a good 2hs before the damage cap at 20 (I hit for 28-29 with same sword my 25 Ranger hits 60's and 70's with)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">05-30-2003, 02:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wurmslayer is still the best weapon you can weild until you get into the 40s and the main hand damage bonus starts to take effect. Get that and any other reasonably prices offhand and you will be fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">05-30-2003, 02:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Centi SS is pretty much a must-have ( used one mainhanded since level 20 and still very nice at 37 )..offhanded you can go with any great ratio weapon...depending on price you can grab a shaded blade/staff, velium graded weapon ( the DN drop ones ), err, lammy's nice too ( that's my offhanded i used with a walrus tooth/blackened mace for skillups )...even a nice mainhander for you up to your mid-40's if you can find one is a Wurmslayer. <br />
I'm assuming you built your wood elf the same way I have, and also assuming strength is a concern. Might want to go CentiSS/Lammy for a while until you can grab some more +str items. That pretty much ( i play a level 37 wood elf warrior myself ) is one of my primary concerns after stamina/hit points. Unbuffed i'm sitting about 140 stamina and 103 strength thereabouts and find carrying a bag or so of gear+what i'm wearing doesn't leave too much room for lugging around my weapon bag + food/drink/arrows .</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you have the money, hands down the best newbie (twink) item is Wavecrasher. Procs at level 1 and is a 20% slow and 20hp DoT for 10 ticks. But it also costs ~12-15k on Xegony. Also adds +9 to AGI and some AC.<br />
<br />
If you are like most newb warriors (much better than a twink like me) and can't afford toys yet, go with either Centi (SS or LS) - you can get the SS for ~200-400 and LS for ~1500-2200 on Xegony. I lucked out with my Bard when he was only in his 30's and got a Centi Longsword for 1k! :-) These weapons are NOT lore either, meaning you can wield both at the same time post DW.<br />
<br />
You may also want aggro management - lots of choices there. Black Blade of Tormenting, Barnacle Covered Axe, etc.<br />
<br />
Whatever your choice - good luck in your decisions, and update the boards with your findings. These boards are resources to the newer EQ players as well as the experienced.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arrden</div><div class="date">05-30-2003, 06:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">WoW thanks for all the suggestions. I just started this char on the newbie server :p. I also play a 55 Ranger on Mith Marr. But i got tired of a lot of the higher end game crap and decided to make Arrden hehe. I think i will try for the centi SS or JBoM with the wurmy. I used a wurmy with my ranger until about 45 and then got my lammy. I will post what i get later on. But i dont have any money to spend so will need to stick with the quested sword and a rusty long sword. WOOT!! This is my first warrior so i dont know a lot about them except from what ive seen grouping with them. I think i will need to get some aggro drawing wpn from what ive seen hehe. Thanks again for the suggestions.<br />

Well I posted some links that since your on a newbie server you can do these quests or a person can do them for phat lewts.  the items are a LoW, Wurmslayer, mithril 2hander and ssoy.  All should become available at a reasonable rate.</div></div><hr />

I'm level 30 now, my 2 hander is a great bane sword of the blind wolf. One hander im using a phosforescent whip from TM in echo and an elder owlbear beak.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arrden</div><div class="date">06-06-2003, 04:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I looked for a JBoM, a wurmy, and a lammy in the bazaar the other day and there were none for sale. I think the server is still to new for anyone to be selling any of that stuff so i will just use what i can get for now i guess.<br />

Drops in Old Sebilis off the golem just past the bug camp ( enter seb, go down the ramp, straight through the doors, make a right down the tunnel, make a left and go straight until you get to the crevass, follow brigde straight across, make a slight right and follow tunnel down. you'll see a temple looking thing and a golem on top of it. common drop is the Larrikan Mask (?) ( 10 charge camo ); rare is lammy (?)</div></div><hr />
