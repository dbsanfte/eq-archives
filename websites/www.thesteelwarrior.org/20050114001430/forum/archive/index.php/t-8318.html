<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unclebong</div><div class="date">07-30-2004, 10:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Last night my guild was in the SW BoT tower at the port up to the 2nd floor (having just cleared the 1st floor in the tower) when we see Icestorm being killed by a group that wasnt even in the zone when we started our crawl up.  <br />
<br />
They did not jump past us on the crawl, they are camped out at the exit of Ice's room.  They log in and kill Ice reguardless of who is in the tower already.  Sometimes they call camp check sometimes they dont.  They have yet to honor someone calling Ice either way.  So as a result my guild gets ganked by 1 group logging in after we are in the tower and 2 GBoS's rotted last night.  Nobody on the server knows who these folks are so the general assumption is they are server xfer's just making cash.  My guess is some yantis type bought 6 time geared toons and is farming BP's for pp to sell on over the web.  Yea its a bad idea to assume/guess/specualte but fuck it, its a rant forum =O<br />
<br />
I know its a FFA target and there are no rules but GM's have kicked guilds out of zones for trying to hop over other guilds crawling in (has happened on Karana at least once) so I'm wondering what others experiences have been along these lines.  Who else is getting ganked by 1 group camped next to a named that sits at the end of a crawl like the BoT towers are set up?</div></div><hr />

He's a puss and is easily 1grp'd :\ the only thing of worth to them at that level though is the bp's I'd guess. me and some friends 1grp'd him and he dropped 2 mantles.. our lvl58 guildy ranger was pleased... the bastard doesn't get enough elemental loot. :p</div></div><hr />

Only 2 other ways I know of would be die/drag with a rogue (does that work through the port ups?) or harmo (still have mobs in the port ups to contend with that way).  They didnt do either of those 2 techniques (we would have seen them)</div></div><hr />

He was hinting at warping with MQ.</div></div><hr />

Roll up there and clear the room before he pops, and engage the second he pops. You'll out dps those dudes regardless of whether or not they're there. It's frustrating as heck though, no doubt about it.<br />
<br />
Fact is, they did make a sacrifice of some variety to be &quot;in place and ready to engage&quot; first. Boycott the ornate market in the bazaar and maybe they'll quit :)</div></div><hr />

It's a hack.  The x,y,z coordinates of where you stand in a zone are completely client side.  The client tells the server where you are, not the reverse like in first person shooter games.  This is why the old unplug the modem, run through mobs, plug the modem back in exploits work.  The client is sending your coordinates to the server, and the server is just accepting them thinking it can trust the client fully.  Having a game do it this way cuts down the appearance of lag down massively, but also leaves it open for easy cheating.  People can use Macro Quest to change where they are standing, warping their character instantly whereever in the zone they want.</div></div><hr />

does it happen to be the same group than there http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=8151 ( it's on karana too...) ?</div></div><hr />

before the $75 movelog thing I'd agree with you.  It was bad enough that you could just buy a top end toon for RL cash money, but now you buy a top end toon from any server and move em anywhere you want for 75bucks.  100kpp goes for $80 (http://www.ige.com/mg/server.asp?gid=33&amp;sid=318&amp;servername=Karana) on karana.  BPs sell for 150k and up in the Baz.  Shit, nice lil money maker there.  Why not ya know?<br />
<br />
Not much of a sacrifice for them, especially when you dont even have to earn it, you can fucking buy it on the internet.  Big one for the folks trying to actaully do this stuff the same way they did.  But theres already enough threads about uber vs non-uber trampling eachothers progression going on this fourm already.</div></div><hr />

Yes and every single day there is one trader (  to not name it jdirty who is selling surpisingly also CT drops ) selling an ornate bp for 90k.<br />
Other are going about for 100 / 120k.</div></div><hr />

CT drops and Ornate BP's geeee whadday know hehe.<br />
EDIT: been a while since I looked at ornate prices, im behind the times =O</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't know what to do about selling/buying characters,just that it's lame.</div></div><hr />

Don't kid yourself. High end raiders leaving the game every day. Just watch PA for a couple of weeks. You can see when a major guild disbands. You get a flood of similarly equipped guys.<br />
<br />
And damn only 100-120K for a bp, must be nice (180K on my server).<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">08-09-2004, 11:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One of my baby alts was coming back to the EF adventure camp a week or two ago and saw a mammoth and I think well, why not? So I start hitting it. Then I see a message: so-and-so begins to cast a spell...<br />
Bleh, little pieces of radioactive mammoth splatter all over the place. Lvl 65 guy scampers down the slope, loots mammoth, runs off without a word.<br />
And, yeah, the nuker came from my right, so he could see my alt and the mammoth's distinctive attack graphic.<br />
Left a bad taste in my mouth because I can understand people contesting over phat l3wt, or that some really nice loot might bring out the worst in some people, but damn, how trailer park is it to nuke trivial mobs out from under toons 35 levels lower than you are?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bardeil</div><div class="date">08-09-2004, 12:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In his defense, he might have thought you got attacked unawares by said mammoth and was trying to be helpful. Not that he couldn't have asked or anything though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">08-09-2004, 01:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, that can happen--and with the mammoths a guy could come up from behind the mob and never see the other player. In this case though, I was at 90% and the mammoth at 75% when the guy nuked &amp; he could see both of us. Normally I'd give someone the benefit of the doubt. Just in this case it seemed like the guy was on autorude mode.<br />
A couple of times in newbie zones newbies have died while I was typing /s Need any help?<br />
So now I have it hotkeyed...if I could remember what hotkey page it's on, heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azaza</div><div class="date">08-09-2004, 06:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Reminds me of the time a 46 druid was soloin in PoJ. I thought I'd be friendly and whack on his rooted near dead Sentry for giggles. Almost instantly i smeared the mob with a finishing blow.<br />
<br />
Because i thought the finishing blow was amusing, i emoted a laugh and went on my way. Next thing i see/hear is his yelling in /ooc about my guild being kill stealers, blah blah.<br />
<br />
He felt better after i gave him a Blue Diamond though for 'stealing' his exp. *grin*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frig Coldheart</div><div class="date">08-09-2004, 06:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hehe a friend of mine is pretty new to EQ. He is a 52 pally and was running thru GD from POK to Velks. Anyway he apparently saw a bard swarm kiting giants. Not being familiar with Bard kiting he immediatly starts trying to help by rooting the giants. He honestly thought the guy was in trouble. Needless to say the Bard got pretty POed. He told me about it later so I explained that it may look like the bard is in bad shape but thats how they solo. Not really a KS story but still alongthe same lines and I found it amusing.</div></div><hr />
