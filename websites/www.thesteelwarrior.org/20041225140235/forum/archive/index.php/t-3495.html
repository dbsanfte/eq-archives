I think you'll always find lightning reflexes and innate defense maxed.  That is because they are like, good, and stuff.  I personally prefered CA/LR to CS/ID, but definately get both asap in a linear order, one then the other.</div></div><hr />

I love LR.  It helps me on boss mobs.  Nothing like watching a god miss 3x in a row =)  It helps me in xp groups.<br />
<br />
With most people doing LDoN, I think its a toss up.  Get both, but I guess it depends on what you want to do first.  For me, LR has made a HUGE difference in my tanking.</div></div><hr />

Maybe at the end, they both mitigated the same amount of dmg (I think some parses around prove this), but CA/LR will reduce the amount of dmg taken from the mob's innate proc, and nothing like that when you have a mob proccing for 1500 :)<br />

Personally, Im almost done with LR5 and maybe I will do some offensive AAs before starting the mitigation way, but thats just me :)</div></div><hr />

 Not getting hit &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; every other possible scenario you can imagine. <br />
<br />
Now as to which is superior ...<br />
If you are under constant fire CS/ID is great.<br />
If you rarely tank  CA/LR is superior.<br />
<br />
So depends actually how you look at it</div></div><hr />

I know that both CA and CS 3 parse out to 10 % avoidance and 10% mitigation, and afaik LR and ID are 1% per lvl each, which means in the end you end up with:<br />
<br />
CA/LR removes 15% of melee dmg directly when maxxed<br />
CS/ID removes 15% of the dmg from successful hits, or about 12.5% of total possible damage, assuming that CA/LR is maxxed since the avoided CA/LR hits would have been reduced by CS/ID in some cases.  You still get a 15% dmg removal on all the hits that arent covered by CA/LR but CS/IDs relative worth imho goes down the more CA/LR the tank has.<br />
<br />
The inverse is not true though, CS/LR in no way alters the dmg removal from CA/LR.<br />
<br />
Either way they both stack and they are both worth maxing.<br />
<br />
I am personally sitting at LR5 and ID0 with CA and CS maxxed and working on those ID points atm.  My route was CA3, CS3, LR5, because 12 AA spent on CS for a ~9% dmg removal (counting CA) was more appealing than a 4% gain in LR (1% per LR lvl x 4 lvls).<br />

<br />
I wouldn't.<br />
<br />
Since 50% mitigation is not going to affect minimum hit at all, I will take the 50% avoidance.<br />
<br />
50% mitigation is NOT always 50% reduction, where 50% avoidance most certainly is. It will help with procs also (in fact, 50% avoidance boost would be incredibly useful on high proccing mobs)<br />

<br />
I dont understand the logic behind that hehe, Im MT for my guild and I went the CA/LR way, prolly will go the mitigation way or some offensive AAs now, but I dont understand why if you are under constant fire (Im all the time) CS/ID is better, when some ppl here already stated the difference between them in that case. Like I said, I prefer avoiding those 1500dmg innate procs than mitigating the inc dmg, besides, lets say your healer has a CH inc and you have 200hp left... and the Sandstorm guy in BoT is gonna crush your arse in the next hit, so, I personally prefer him missing that 700dmg, and gaining those secs for the inc CH,  than mitigating it to 600s, which would kill me.<br />

My general feeling was that the luclin tanking aas were better than the PoP tanking aas.  ND is better than PD, CA is better than LR so I felt that CS would be a better 2nd choice than LR.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its not an if issue its a must.<br />
<br />
To be honest any tank that plans on tanking ele mobs needs to have <br />
<br />
ND: 3/3 <br />
CA: 3/3 <br />
CS: 3/3 <br />
PE: 1/1 <br />
PD: 3/3 <br />
LR: 5/5 <br />
ID: 5/5 <br />
PP: 5/5 <br />
<br />
<br />
At those levels. As a minimum. SE   Flurry Double Riposte and Crits both arch, class and POP abilities are critical.<br />
<br />
All of them help you mitigate damage and hold aggro.</div></div><hr />

True, absolute Avoidance removes the chance of innate proc.<br />
Keep in mind, they can miss you 10%-15% more... but then don't forget the 85%-90% of the time that CA/LR didn't &quot;work&quot;.<br />
Same with mitigation.  blah.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Both are great, dont get me wrong.<br />
While you are MTing of course you need both.<br />
<br />
Lets suppose Boss01 decides to turn and Offer you 2 swings.<br />
2 swings for 1000-2000 (ouch)<br />
<br />
What would you prefer : <br />
- 50% extra chance of avoiding the hits (with some luck not getting hit)<br />
- 50% mitigation if you take the hit (with some luck getting hit for min)<br />
<br />
Not getting hit is more efficient than getting hit for less<br />
if you are &quot;under sporadic fire&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Before LR5 i had to have roughly 2 cheals per kill...one in the middle of the fight and then one at the end to top my hp back off...<br />
<br />
After I got LR5 I can kill a mob with one cheal per kill....soemtimes I can even wait till the next mob and just get one at the begining of the kill after it's slowed. My friends noticed it and i noticed it. In a normal xp group i have about 8.1k raid buffed i have about 8,550 hp. <br />
<br />
I have several friends that are MA's for Time enabled guilds. Three of these guilds require their casters and everyone else to get LR5. Melee class's are encouraged to get LR5 before ID5. <br />

Anyway, this is my experience with those AA's....consequently I am now working on CS3--&gt;ID5 =)</div></div><hr />

Has this ever been confirmed before? I mean does LR5 really allow you to miss 15% of incoming attacks? Also how does PE figure into that equation? I would just like to know what the actual % is with CA3 PD LR5...if anyone has any info please do post.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerald</div><div class="date">10-15-2003, 11:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think Sscaley did some parses a while back when he used to play his warrior and found that overall, they both pretty much reduced damage by the same amount on average. The nice thing about getting missed more though is that mobs don't proc on misses, so that might give CA/LR more priority.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kaledan</div><div class="date">10-15-2003, 11:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am pretty sure the formula for mob to hit chance is:<br />
<br />
                  (MTHA)<br />
-------------------------------------------------<br />
(MHTA + avoidance * avoidance modifier)<br />
<br />
where:<br />
MHTA = mob 'to hit' ATK, usually something like level * 5, but affected by mob-specific bonuses, buffs and debuffs, etc.<br />
<br />
avoidance is the avoidance AC reported for a character using the &amp;debug=true magelo trick. Based on defence skill and agility, it ranges from 480 to 520 for level 65 warriors.<br />
<br />
avoidance modifier is what you increase when you buy CA and LR. Note that these don't increase your displayed AC, but clearly do do something. The avoidance modifier is the figure mentioned in the aaxp text, e.g. CA3 is 10% bonus, so avoidance modifier = 1.1).<br />
<br />
This formula:<br />
<br />
goes smoothly form 0% to 100% chance based on relative mob power<br />
<br />
produces results matching some old parses I did showing that a level 1 mob hit the back of a 50something melee 1% of the time, a level 4 4%, and a level 12 11%. For higher level mobs, the hit percentage trailed off behind the mob level.<br />
<br />
If this formula is right, then the affect of CA and LR will vary depending on how much the mob was originally hitting you.<br />
<br />
214/(214+500) = 0.30, 214/(214+550) = 0.28<br />
400/(400+500) = 0.44, 400/(400+550) = 0.42<br />
600/(600+500) = 0.56, 600/(600+550) = 0.52<br />
800/(800+500) = 0.62, 800/(800+550) = 0.59<br />
1000/(1000+500)=0.67, 1000/(1000+550) = 0.65 <br />
<br />
These look like plausible results, but I haven't seen a good parse of CA that removes the effects of dodges etc by having the mob attack from behind.<br />
<br />
So in general, CA3 drops the mobs hit percentage by 2 or 3 percentage points. This has more effect on mobs with a low %chance to hit, in the best case dropping 10% off incoming DPS. It won't have any real effect on damage spikes.<br />
<br />
Bottom line: CA is best when tanking blue or lower mobs. I suspect the opposite is true of CS.<br />

Monks. With avatar. A long time ago, there was a parse or two demonstrating the uselessness of Agility.<br />
<br />
I believe some shamans also tested it, long before that.<br />

I haven't seen a parse of that nature on this board though.</div></div><hr />

That would just about make 1 percentage point adjustment to hit rate under perfect conditions on a level 65, using the numbers and formula from the above post.<br />
<br />
So it would be really hard, and kind of pointless, to get a statistically significant parse on a level 65.<br />
<br />
Only real way would be to create two new characters with different AGIs and lower defence skill. At low levels the AGI bonus will make more of a difference, given lower defence skill.<br />

My point wasnt is agility helpful, it was does it increase &quot;avoidance&quot;.<br />
<br />
Im pretty sure Ive seen parses that show it to increase mitigation, not avoidance.  It makes no sense, but then again what in EQ does.  And you cant take anything from magelos calcs other than someones guess, they dont have access to EQs code.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So when youre a warrior and go fight some mobs in PoV who do not have any proc they could land on you ( innate proc not weapon proc ) ID 5 should bring the same then LR 5 .<br />
<br />
When youre a chanter then LR 5 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ID 5 cause youre defense isnt great and its better to evade. When you evade you can cast a rune .. when he hits you for 600 instead of 650 he has a chance to interrupt your cast.<br />
 <br />
When you fight a mob with an innate proc of 3 k damage LR 5 will own ID 5 cause an innate proc can only land when the hit lands.<br />
ID 5 will not have any effect on this innate procs cause theyre going on the resists against fire/cold ... .<br />
<br />
So when youre normally only exping a mix of both would bring best effects. When youre raiding proccing mobs LR 5 is the first choice.(after that ID 5 for sure )</div></div><hr />
