My slot lacking was my belt - rbg. I wanted to try and see what it is like with no haste so I switched it in with a Flame Buckled Belt (check my mag) , its got 85hp.<br />
<br />
With no base haste item, Vallons Quickening, and my Eyepatch of Plunder haste buff, I see no real change in aggro loss, but a loss in dps. <br />
<br />
Can anyone confirm what they have found expirimenting with no haste? The extra dps haste provides is nice I agree, but Im waiting on a haste bracer to drop.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The bard Haste buffs that take you over the cap are in slot one but are &quot;Haste v3&quot; which I guess is different..<br />
<br />
If this is correct, you could have Vallon's Quickening, Speed of the Brood, and Warsong of Zek all going for 159% Haste..</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can have both effects up at the same time, however the only haste you'd get would be coming from Vallon's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aspit</div><div class="date">06-08-2003, 11:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">warsong and eyepatch are the same buff.  If you have warsong on and trye to eyepatch your spell does not take hold.  As for if they stack or not i would assume not but since its in the same slot as bard haste it may.  Anyway i tanked fennin wo haste the other day cause i kindof wasnt paying attention and had no problems wo vallon on me so the few % you lose in that isnt an issue.<br />

He drops a pretty nice belt that I wouldn't mind having myself. ;)<br />

I just hope it still drops.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can get both AQ and Augmentation of death on my necro pet, but it doesn't mean he's hasted 150%.<br />
<br />
Just because both icons are on you doesn't mean the hastes stack on top of themselves, which they don't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dumptimax</div><div class="date">06-09-2003, 09:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's funny how many people even up to 65 still don't realize you can only have ONE spell haste (that includes *regular* bard songs!) buff.  Sure, you have multiple icons up, but thats because the other stats from the buff stack, ONLY the highest haste takes effect.  There is ONE excecption to this which is the bards ervaj/vah shir spells (which are a miniscule amount of haste), they DO  stack with other spell haste or bad songs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Aye, that it is. Methinks it's because most people have never played a monk before.<br />
<br />
/em whispers something about Celestial Tranquility Icon and Visions of Grandeur Icon being up at the exact same time almost every day of his EQ career from level 55 to 60.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I'm sure the wonderful, and polite monks over at MB would be glad to explain how spell/song and item haste all stack together for people still confused on the issue. They've already done so millions of times.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">06-10-2003, 03:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, you said you can get extra haste if you don't have a bard around by using your eyepatch, which is incorrect.   Your eyepatch will not add haste on top of your enchanter/shaman haste.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Skullreaper Zek</div><div class="date">06-10-2003, 10:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would not call the Bard haste cap breakers miniscule. Any advantage is worth taking and has noticeable affects.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TaiilChayser</div><div class="date">06-10-2003, 12:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As for the reason you are not having a problem holding aggro is because its been found thru testing over at The Shaman's Crucible that proc's are figured in a proc/min fashion.. so haste/slow have no effect on the overall proc rate. The only thing that was found to affect proc rate is DEX.<br />
<br />
Just say that the SoD is coded to proc 6 times /min.. assuming a constant DEX level. you will get 6 procs per min with no haste, some, haste, fully hasted. even slowed.</div></div><hr />
