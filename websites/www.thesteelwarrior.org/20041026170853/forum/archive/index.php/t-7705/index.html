<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ghazad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey guys<br />
<br />
I have been wondering which of my alts to level to 65 to DC with my warrior (magelo below) for XP grinding. I can't really decide which class would be better - shaman, druid or cleric.<br />
<br />
Could you please post your opinions/experiences on which class you would prefer and which zones would be ideal for such a duo?<br />
<br />
Thanks guys,<br />

Just buy a Virtue and Brells SS at PoK and you'll pretty much dudlicate the most powerful duo in the game - Paladin/Shaman (other than a Necro or Bard grouped with a Warior and the Warrior afk). Slow, a haste buff, a pet, HoT, and Canni is teh win.<br />
<br />
Try Maidens Eye, Fungus Grove, and PoInnovation.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've really heard shaman is the way to go. Clerics have a lot of good points as well. Druids don't have good enough points though, in my opinion. Getting a ToD goes a long way towards making a cleric a better choice.<br />
<br />
Shaman plusses: Slow. Buffs. Debuffs. Mana efficient dots. HoTs. Canni.<br />
<br />
Cleric plusses: CH. Pacify. Reverse DS. HP buffs.<br />
<br />
Druid plusses: DS. Snare. Better heals than shamans. Evac/ports. Buffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have tried 2 boxing cleric and druid as well as 3 boxing sham/dru/war<br />
<br />
cleric + warrior combo is very easy to two box the easiest of all 3. Utility is lacking but you get rez and low mana heals. After 39 cleric is an asset not a liability.<br />
<br />
shaman + war combo I cant tell you how it is with lvl 65 sham but till 60 shaman heals are pretty much non existent at least when healing high hp warrior. Although after slow heals might be not an issue. Probably best dps combo because you got pet and haste.  I'd say after 60 shaman is an asset. If you 2 box, but in a group with others, then shamies probably can start being useful in areas where 65 hunts around mid 50s.<br />
<br />
druid + war combo best utility since you get ports/snare and other stuff as well as good heals but for a lot of mana. After 58 they are an asset. At 65 a lot of options open up like charming and more mana to do whatever. If you are playing with others can be main healer or dps or whatever else.<br />
<br />
Basically if you want to get a toon that will start being useful ASAP go with cleric. A day or two pling should net you lvl 39 and then 45 or so that you can group them. The other classes are not much use at 2 boxing till much later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Taneldar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have boxed both a 65 druid and 65 cleric w/ my warrior, it is very hard to say which i like better because it just depends on the situation. I dont think you can go wrong with either one...both have pros and cons. I do know a 65 war who boxes a 65 cleric and he loves it and goes and does some pretty cool stuff with that duo. Having a rez bot is always very useful specialy if you like to try new and crazy things =P.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've boxed a 62 druid and my 54 cleric and I say the cleric is the better way to go. 1 CH is very nice instead of constantly healing. Sure you loose out on snare, but it's not that big of a deal if the mob isn't sowed. ToD is a must.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I like my cleric a lot.  He is head and shoulders above a druid or shaman as a healer, and rez is a big bonus.  <br />
<br />
A shaman won't be worth a damn as a primary healer until 60+ and some AA probably, but a 65 shaman with basic AA and their important spells is a pretty powerful character.  Slow is huge, but right now I think if a cleric can't heal you on an unslowed mob, then a shaman is gonna have a hard time getting it slowed and keeping you alive at the same time.  ToD goes quite a ways toward replacing a shaman, but you can't depend on it, and if you can't do a mob without the slow, then you are gonna wipe regularly counting on a ToD.  Shaman also takes a lot more effort than the other two, which is a factor for 2-boxing.<br />
<br />
Druid is a handy character to have around, and a pretty damn good healer when they get 60+, but I wouldn't trade my cleric for one 2-boxing.  <br />
<br />
Your biggest problem with a cleric/warrior is lack of utility.  Get some sow and lev pots and a pair of cobalt pants if at all possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Clerics have very useful utility in indoor zones, but much less useful in outdoor zones.  They are really designed for dungeons, as druids are designed for outdoors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Holywrath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Warrior/Shaman.<br />
<br />
Having a mob slowed 75 percent is just awesome.  Not to mention the stat buffs and regeneration buff.  Just buy a Virtue someplace and get crackin.  Shamans also get some really nice DoTs that really help.  Quiessence/Breath of Trushar is more than enough to keep you healed, don't forget haste!  Canni V should be enough to keep things rolling.. is it just me or shaman spells take so much mana =X<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit:  I forget to mention, you'll probably want a good 2hander to duo with any of these classes.  Less riposte and more dps for the win.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Clerics have very useful utility in indoor zones, but much less useful in outdoor zones.  They are really designed for dungeons, as druids are designed for outdoors.<br />
<br />
  How are clerics less useful outdoors? All their abilities still work. Did you mean they were less useful relative to druids outdoors?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Holywrath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Probably.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>ibithor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">i have to agree a cleric is the best bot. you can buy weapons for slow and snare so no big deal there. a clerc is useful far sooner then any of the other classes(someone mentioned quin for shammy to heal with vs complete heal for cleric which they get in their 30's iirc) and the rez is sure nice when things go south<br />
<br />
as a former xp cleric i promise you a low level cleric will get a group in a high lvl zone faster than a druid or shammy simply because the spells the cleric casts cant be resisted (heals) and the shammy slow most likely will be and that means dead shammy and thats no help to the group. why anyone would even consider letting a lower level druid in their group is absolutely beyond me /shrugs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">A cleric is the easiest to bot ,but, not the best imo.It's situational as to what the best partner would be,however, I would go shammy if you primarily want to duo.My wife is a 65 shammy(admittedly she has over 200 aa now and ep gear) and we can duo most white cons where our best friend cleric (with over 400 aa and ep gear) would have a lot more troublewith me.The only tense moments are before slow lands.If she gets a lot of resists and has to juggle heals it can be interesting,but, trash like POF c1 mobs are trivial for us.Her Tnarg's does 1770 to about 3600hp and Q is the main healing device.We bagged her ch long time ago.Really for a shammy/ war duo past Q the world opens up.She has solo healed and slowed for our groups in solro,poe, pof and sewers is looking like another good spot.It's alot of work for her though and we prefer to have other healers along,but, we can do it np.Pulling singles and no innate snare are our biggest challenges in new places usually.<br />
<br />
Slow is powerful hehe.Snares,dc pets,rezzes,ports,pacify and ch are pretty kewl too tho. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Buuhmann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">cleric, all the way, especially in the endgame.<br />
Cleric = duoing in hard zones without downtime. dps from the DS, by far the best healer when your adding 4 ppl and build a group. You probably end up nuking more with the cleric than with the druid, cause of the very efficiennt CH. <br />
<br />
Slow isnt that uber anymore since many mobs mitigate it.  Even when the mob is slowed, a sham will need more mana and / or time to heal you up. If you get adds or multi incs (you can pacify to get rid of that) you just start CHs at 60% instead of 30% health etc. A sham probably couldnt keep up healing the dps of multiple mobs. <br />
<br />
You still CAN slow with a ToD / willsapper and snare with different weapons. Ornate gauntlets are pretty cheap for selfhaste. You also can add an ornate BP to selfbuff the focus / shield line buffs .<br />
<br />
(Well im actually not speaking of leveling an alt but of grinding AA exp in EPs / GoD with EP - Time / GoD geared chars. A sham rocks too in lower tier zones, so can a druid from lvl 58 (3k CH) until you enter PoP where they suck until you get the better CH.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Oron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Ive tried both cleric and shaman.  I like the cleric better.  Using pacify to break spawns is handy, as is not worrying about dying.  There have been several times that I try something hard that I wouldnt normally try just because dying just isnt an issue.<br />
<br />
They are both really good though, and I doubt you will ever kick yourself for not choosing the other.  <br />
<br />
Never tried a druid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Holywrath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">A shaman is the MOST efficient way of duoing with a warrior.  Period.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Well,I dunno.If you're forming groups a cleric is by far the better tool in your pocket to build around.If I go to Sol ro in a duo and pull 2's with a cleric and no slow(ep cleric 400+aa ft 15 etc) we're gonna be hooped if i tank both I thk.My wife can  and has healed me back down from upstairs thru 2's while slowing np and if she has kei....well she doesn't run out of mana hehe.The last time we did this in SRT I had less gear and she only had about ft8 or 10 i thk.<br />
<br />
The cleric i play with has double the aa and a little more gear than my shammy wife.She can heal me wherever we go..tipt whatever.However,generally on xp trash my wife finds it way easier to duo with me than the cleric would.I don't have a slow weapon and the trash that we fight that mitigates are still heavily affected by slow.Don't get me wrong...I love cleric heals and with my wife I almost always engage Q'd.Shammys balance a warrior well, however.They lower mob dps and increase the warrior's to better balance fights.Theres no way that with no slow and just the 2 of us my cleric friend would be doing much dps healing me in say pof.Maybe with time gear that'll change,but, not now.If slowed yeh she could melee and chain nuke.My wife after slow's in just keeps Q up and chain dots,pets etc.After slow it's easy even with most white con's that mitigate.<br />
<br />
A cleric is not a better partner in my world of eq.In a group yeh ,but, with two of us no way in wooey ville.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Slow is uber.Shammys have canni-5 and Q.er... no way hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">This is not a slight to shamans.  Shamans rock and naturally they are outstanding to duo with.  I just think you are discounting the power and utility of clerics.<br />
<br />
Pacification is powerful and clerics get it early.  Pacification means manageable pulls everywhere.  It means unexpected roamers don't aggro you.  It means you can fight next to a dangeorus mob if you want to.  I can't count the number of times that I've made invisibility irrelevant thanks to pacification.  I used to do some neat tricks by combining Pacification with Atone in the old days, but modern zone design doesn't really need it.<br />
<br />
Clerics have some of the best standing regen (admittedly second to shamans with their Cann5).  Their DS has no real drawbacks when you are fighting one mob at a time.  They have a variety of tools to prevent death when things start going badly, and death means little with a cleric anyway.<br />
<br />
I am slightly worse equipped than Gunnar, but to me Pof c1 is about average 2-boxing fare.  Duoing the golems beyond c1 is more interesting. :)<br />
<br />
Naturally there are some places where a shaman would be superior to a cleric.  That's as it should be.  I had trouble duoing Ferubi, for example, where Gunnar probably doesn't have trouble with it.  And there are many times I wish I could lay on extra DPS through DOTs and a real pet and good haste.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">ive boxed cleric war and sham war. with a ToD, and if u have good hps /ac to withstand a beating from bog standard exp mobs like in BoT, then cleric warrior works fine. cleric also allows u to exp in a few more places as u can get single pulls via pacify. and cleric war is good for sol ro farming. whereas not really possible or hard with sham warrior.<br />
<br />
but personally, fo pure grinding, i do prefer a sham. their HoTs can keep u up pretty easily and they bring that much more dps in the form of haste, FA dots and pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">and cleric war is good for sol ro farming. whereas not really possible or hard with sham warrior. <br />
<br />
  I had a warrior in my guild who always duoed her shaman and warrior. She owned me in Sol Ro. She'd just tank both of them, slowed. Sol Ro mobs don't mitigate slow much if at all and she'd just go to town. She cleared through a heck of alot faster than I did, too. Haste + no ToD = much faster slaughter. It surprised the heck out of me. We had about the same equipment even, I had more ac and she had more hp. Both of us had a BoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Holywrath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">In BoT it's easy to take 4 mobs at once with a shaman/warrior.  Why pacify? =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Yup , I can tank multi pulls in these places and after slows in it's trivial.I've done the same with  cleric's and It's alot harder.Imo a slowed mob is easier to heal for a shammy(I usually only need Q) than an unslowed mob is for a cleric to heal in most cases.I've botted both as well and a cleric is less work for me to bot though.<br />
<br />
My wife and I duo a lot.I also routinely play with the cleric i mentioned with double my wifes aa.Mobs are harder for her to heal unslowed than for my wife slowed.With good(for ep level) gear and 400+ aa the clerics mana pool takes a significant hit when I tank unslowed mobs and our dps is bunk really.Maybe if I wasn't made outa paper it would go better ,but, it's np with my wife.However,as I said I agree it's situational.Our base regular group is cleric ,necro,shammy and war and we've played with all combos of that a fair bit.Pacify is great.<br />
<br />
I used to play with a friends cleric/beast that was truly uber hehe. :) Though they didn't need me...except for special encounters.</div></div><hr />

5 x MoR DS on 5 unslowed mobs = dps :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Hehe omgz excitement! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Conanix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I use a 65 druid when I am boxing. The DS owns. I have the ornate BP so no shaman needed. POT9 and i buy a 25-40pp buff instead of a 50pp buff. (symbol instead of Virt)<br />
  Then i SoE and  seasons myself. Port where i want to go LVL. (mostly Droga for faction) Druid has clicky bracer and epic. 2 good dots = no mana used. One heal per mob not slowed. 1-2%AA XP. Verry much a good time. I would never trade out for any other toon. If it gets bad i can disc woods or instant evak. I just got that bard song for him last week. <br />
   But like everybody has said. It depends on the toon and what you want to do. I can also go to HoH and kite with druid and afk  myself.  Can a cleric or shm do that??</div></div><hr />

Tried war/dru, I have to be more careful about when I heal.  All in all, I miss the cleric for duoing, heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Whoever says that any combo listed here is better then the other is offering uneducated opinion. There are many benefits in going one way instead of other. For each his own.<br />
<br />
Personally after boxing my lvl 50 cleric and friend’s lvl 65 cleric I still prefer druid much more. I usually box in group settings. A lot of times my druid plays main healer, but when a slower present most of the times I have enough mana to nuke, charm and do whatever else. When I can't make a group, I am still able to get by killing good xp mobs with ease using just 2 of my toons. The only thing I ever miss about cleric is res. That’s it. Shamie was fun to two box but I only had access to lvl 56 one and he wasn’t cutting it for me in xp grinds I am used to. From what I was able to tell they give a lot of options and were fun for me as well. Cleric is too single sided for my taste. Druid and shaman definitely don’t have to be main healer, but they can be. On other hand with cleric you pretty much stuck with that role.<br />
<br />
Just to be clear, I am in no way saying war+clr or war+shm combo is less powerful or whatever. For me druid wins as partner, because he gives me more options then any others. I can go try crazy ass stuff pretty much risk free with exodus and quick evacs. EnSnare for me is irreplaceable. I am definitely not depending on snare whip with its short lasting snare. Charming is sweet. For example without it I wouldnt have been able to get done BoT keys so quick without it. I love ds. Ease of moving around in old world. Tracking. Yada, yada, yada.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Certainly each of the priests have their advantages.  In terms of actual XP earned per hour by the duo, I'm not sure which would come out on top.  I'd guess the shaman.  A cleric bot is unlikely to exceed 80 DPS, where the other priests can far exceed that.  I personally enjoy the cleric because I love having both characters melee.  Where slow allows a shaman to tank, elixir generally allows a cleric to do the same.  Where druid DS enables damaging multiple mobs at a time, cleric DS does the same, just with more hassle.  Where you can go solo kite HOH with your druid, you can solo tank HOH undead with the cleric.  Different styles for different people.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Druids and shaman can &quot;far exceed&quot; 80 dps while healing the tank and slowing (in the case of the shaman)?  Somehow I doubt it.  But it's true a cleric won't get anywhere near 80 dps, more like 40 max I would guess, unless they're chain-nuking undead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Well,my wife usually malos an inc as soon as she can tgt it.Then if slow lands all she normally needs for heals is to apply Q every so often.Occasionally, on resists she needs to fast heal a bit and that would delay the onset of her dps.Q does not affect her mana pool really and she can keep that going on me indefinately if need be.Then she's free to stack dot's and sick the puppy...or cough...puppies(she made me add that hehe).If she's solo healin and slowin she doesn't nuke much unless it's to finish and er well we don't parse,but,she contributes well now to our combined dps.This wasn't always the case.With less gear and ft heals,slows and buffs took up more of her mana supply.<br />
<br />
This doesn't take into account the amount my dps is increased by her.She always chains avatar &amp; haste on me.Yeah, you could have ornate guants in your pocket and a primal to swap in to mitigate those advantages ( I'm sure everyone has and uses them...),but, it's an innate advantage to the pairing.<br />
<br />
I haven't set out to xp duo with a cleric in awhile honestly.Usually, that occurs by accident and we remedy it fairly quickly.So im interested now and hopefully I can drag one off to duo with me for a bit.Druid's like clerics bring a lot of situational stuff to the table.Charmin dillo's in poe is nice dps.However,I remember when we first got into eps it being a lot tougher for a druid to heal even with a slower relatively.<br />
<br />
Any of these classes will easily keep a warrior up in places trivial to them.BOT is not the same place anymore for me and my wife.We can get absolutely silly there and not pay the price.I imagine a time warrior would giggle in pof c1 with a druid healing multi pulls and no slow.The pairings all have situational advantages no doubt.Ports,evac,snare pacify etc.all kewl and if you're fighting trivial stuff then it doesn't really matter.Also you can get a lot of toys to mitigate class innate advantages.I've never played with a TOD and if you have one  and it slows consistently that would go a long way to nullify the shaman advantage.<br />
<br />
Imho though,for duoing straight up challenging fights there is no better partner for a warrior than a shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Imho though,for duoing straight up challenging fights there is no better partner for a warrior than a shaman.<br />
<br />
cant agree with this again. I can do chalenging stuff with my druid which probably you cant because of a few reasons. In big pop outdoor fights I can charm and haste some crazy dps mob and turn a hard mob into my bitch, providing charm holds. If not there are still escape options to get things under controll like evac/exodus. Plus DS dps is up there too on unslowed mobs as well as better healing goes a long way as well.<br />
<br />
I am not sure what strategies are there for hard stuff for cleric, but the fact that they get 9k heal for 400 mana means they can heal for much much longer on hard mobs then either druid or shaman I even highly doubt shaman can keep up with heals on anything unslowed that hits decently hard. Throw in a rez into the equation for the times it didnt work out.<br />
<br />
xp mobs be it chalenging or non can be handled just fine by any of these combos.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Cleric has about 3/4 the DS of a druid, and as Casai said, DS is more significant on unslowed mobs.  Mark of Kings seems to be relatively worthless to me, but in theory it reduces healing requirements too.  Add in Bulwark of Vie and Elixir, and you have a lot of mitigation, which slows down the healing requirements.  What a cleric can't do is improve or match the warrior's own DPS.  So you have really long fights with little downtime in between.<br />
<br />
A cleric just swinging a hammer and deploying the hammer pet does about 30 DPS (and regens mana while doing it).  With nukes this rises to 60 DPS but cannot be sustained without downtime.  Any way you look at it, fights are long with a cleric.  The only real strategy to counter this is to fight hard mobs that give higher XP per minute of combat.<br />
<br />
On undead the fight profiles are far different, as a cleric can easily reach 80+ DPS and still heal and not have downtime, but how much undead do you duo at level 65?  Things will become interesting for this pair when single/duo LDONs are implemented.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Like i said i agree with the situational aspects.I know for a fact when we broke into ep's a druid could not keep me up well on poe or c1 trash without slow... we tried.Even with slow our druids at the time had to pause a lot for mana.When srt was new to us a cleric healing me without any slow especially on 2 mobs was tossing ch's hard and fast and with a lotta aa would run low mana fast and high aggro with ch's.Our druids couldn't heal me on 2 mobs there without slow at the time.Once slowed the healng is very low aggro and easy for a shammy to control.Yeah,if there's problems slowing things get tense.However,my wife went up and down with us pulling 2's and I swear healing was far easier without worry of aggro bldng after slow.<br />
<br />
Yeh, now anyone can heal me on yard trash so it doesn't matter.Same in srt multi pulls have become trivial.I know when i was leveling up and gearing up at 65 that there were many straight melee fights I couldn't do with a cleric of equal  strength that I could with a shammy.This is why my wife made a shammy on stromm when we started here hehe.If a mob is unslowable then the advantage is lost otherwise slow isvery powerful.i won't convince you guys,but, this has been my experience and in the past I always preferred duoing or small grps.I was never a big social eq type.<br />
<br />
Disclaimer...I love clerics and druids btw. :) <br />
<br />
Pst ...Casai ,yeh charming is powerful I agree but highly situational.What I meant by a straight up fight was war tanking from the get go and surving with his partners heals,buffs  and debuffs.Prayneagle my wife can solo all sorts of big stuff while I watch np hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I would agree on hard hitting mobs with higher aa'd geared people a cleric could keep a warrior up in cases where a shaman wouldn't.GOD has some hard hitting mobs that die fast and the advantage of slow is decreased where strong fast heals are more important.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">A Time+ shaman in a MAYHEM MACHINE.<br />
FT20 + 20% MP + TA = Can keep up a group in hard just on his own.<br />
<br />
My best LDoN group was : Warrior / Shaman / Mnk / Rogue x 3<br />
(Did Collect 20 hard, in like 15 minutes).<br />
<br />
The average shaman, should have zero problems keeping up a normal group as<br />
long has he has some decent FT (10+) and HoT Extention + MP.<br />
<br />
Just a few things : <br />
- Use Tagar (125 mana 50% slow)  vs  Tugur (250 mana 70% slow)<br />
- Never ever direct heal, Quiescence all the way (even before pulls)<br />
- Get KEI <br />
<br />
<br />
While Warrior/Cleric duo is a great combo it lacks the 2 most important things :<br />
- DPS capacity (this is somewhat reduced with Ornate Gloves for haste)<br />
- Damage Mitigation (CH=6000/400=15hp/mana  Quiescence=7x420/280=10hp/mana + Slow).<br />
<br />
Even if you are &quot;uber&quot; and can push CH to 22hp/mana (max efficiency) , the cleric will<br />
run out of mana before the shaman because of the slow factor.<br />
Add to that the fact shaman can do extra dps (epic, pet, haste, avatar).<br />
<br />
Shaman = Best Duo Partner for a warrior.<br />
<br />
However having Cleric/Warrior team (as i do with a friend) means you have a GTG team.<br />
Tank/Healer spots covered, and actually even Tank/Healer/Puller if you can pacify.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">I totaly agree with your mana break down and there is no question that on slowed mobs shaman has no dificulty.<br />
<br />
Howerever slow is not necesary for xping. Also there are other things that should be considered then mana efficiency.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Xarilok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Slight derail...<br />
<br />
Use a Shaman. Just buy a Virtue and Brells SS at PoK and you'll pretty much dudlicate the most powerful duo in the game - Paladin/Shaman (other than a Necro or Bard grouped with a Warior and the Warrior afk). Slow, a haste buff, a pet, HoT, and Canni is teh win.<br />
<br />
Try Maidens Eye, Fungus Grove, and PoInnovation.<br />
<br />
BB<br />
<br />
Paladin/Shaman is hardly the most powerful combo in the game.<br />
<br />
Beastlord/Druid owns it hands down.<br />
<br />
Pal/Shm and Bst/Dru both have slow and haste and shaman buffs...<br />
<br />
Beast adds better pet (can offtank nps), better dps (by FAR), tankability close to that of the Pal, combined with the druids superior healing ability tanking is effectively the same, SNARE, evacs, ports, DS, SNARE...oh, did I mention snare? Oh, and Track for finding named mobs.<br />
<br />
Grab a KEI and buff each other with 9 and SD for a tasty 31 mana/tick.  Pal/Shm cant do that.<br />
<br />
Puller/Tank/Slowing being one toon makes agro a non-issue.<br />
<br />
Mini-stonestance every 4 minutes makes resisted slows a non-issue.<br />
<br />
Regen rates of over 100 hp/tick makes exp grinding INSANELY fast due to the druid becoming a snare/DPS machine.  (Replinishment+Natures recovery+fungi+troll/Iksar+AA=40+30+15+18+6=109)<br />
<br />
LDoN focused pet has 4800HP and regens over 200hp/tick non-combat.<br />
<br />
Pal/Shm has a small edge in taking out the hardest mobs as a duo, but for general exp and named mob slaughter, BL/Dru is by far the best.<br />
<br />
Back on topic...<br />
<br />
Shm is best, followed by druid, and cleric last imo.<br />
<br />
Slow/Haste is godly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">I disagree somewhat about the mana analysis.  A self buffed cleric keeping yaulp up is regenning 20 mana/tick before external buffs.  This beats the above druid-bst example, as the cleric can reach 43 mana/tick with SD and KEI, compared to the druid's 31.<br />
<br />
To take Emilia's examples: A cleric casting 6k CH every 15 seconds means you are killing mobs that do 400 DPS.  A shaman using Quiescence and Tagars is only killing mobs that did 140 DPS before slow.  Definitely not in the same league.<br />
<br />
Now, if the shaman also casts Tnarg every 15 seconds (2k with foci/AA?) then that's killing mobs that did 406 DPS before slow.  Now they're killing equivalent mobs for equivalent healing mana, and the difference comes down to mana regen and fight durations.<br />
<br />
Both the cleric and shaman can stretch further than this, but with the shaman using Turgur's and able to cast Tnarg twice as fast, the shaman bot does let a warrior fight harder mobs than the cleric.... if we ignore survivability of damage spikes.<br />
<br />
At some DPS the damage spikes will become too hazardous for the shaman bot, and I think you'd probably find it's right near the healing limit of the cleric as well.<br />
<br />
There is no question that the shaman wins for mana regen and probably wins on fight duration out of all 3 priests.  I am not sure of the typical downtime of a druid bot.  I would guess that it would have the highest downtime of the three priests, but that's just a guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">I'm not doing the math .From experience I know what I duoed best with post 50.However,did you account for the increased tnarg's with gear and aa?.Just checking because my wife's base tnarg heal is 1900's and often heals to around 3500.Due to the example cleric used I was wondering if this was accounted for.<br />
<br />
Anyways,once past a certain point in warrior aggro and cleric ft/aa that duo can ch fast a lot for a fight.This isn't the case for many 65 clerics im sure.I know that in the past a long hard fight for my wife and I would have run a cleric of equal strength oom with an equivalent druid standing no chance.Slow is a very powerful equalizer.Now days  with the xp trash we're fighting for the most part anyone can heal me.Although ,I haven't tried to duo in vxed yet hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Beasts can do so much.Without considering charm duos I always liked beast/cleric hehe.Though we are really talking about warrior partners here. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Niclet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">In addition to my warrior (whom will become my raiding main), I mostly 2-box a 65 druid with 200aas and a 65 BL with 80aas, both pre-elemental low tier PoP level gear (some ornate, etc.).<br />
<br />
BL has 6800ish hps raid buffed with 1200ish ac.  She has about maxed regen with Riwwi BP (33 a tick I think atm).  She is sitting at LR2 atm with full CA, 1CS, PE etc.  She tanks Riwwi named without blinking.  I imagine with full defensive aas its gonna be way easier.<br />
<br />
One thing noone mentioned is that druids and beastlords have a crateload of stackable regen.  BoR + Nature's Recovery = around 60 a tick.  Alot of crummy druid players don't even know they stack.  Add in her own regen buffs and she has OVER 100/tick regen STANDING.  Mana cost is negligible.  Now add in Paragon and SoTW which stack even more regen for named mobs and  this mitigates heals ALOT. Imagine a shammy adding Quiescence to this mix!<br />
<br />
Stackable DS + pet + her dps + brackencoat + coldain ring = I think 68 DS.<br />
<br />
Druid has FT12, is evo spec'd with full FoMM aas, so with ID IV he is critting for over 3k almost every other fire nuke.  With KEI he can nuke constantly AND heal and not lose much mana.<br />
<br />
Then add slow, haste and snare!<br />
<br />
Gravy.<br />
<br />
I don't know how any other combo in the game can match this.  I only miss being able to pacify indoors, some healing power (kinda) and some mitigation on the beasty.<br />
<br />
To address the topic:  I LOVE my warrior, even without slow she's an animal.  The druid combo works great with her.  Druid cheal blows in the endgame, but works just fine for a 50s warrior with say 7k hps.  Druids are amazing utility which is worth some inefficiency in healing IMHO.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That wasnt my point, I was just refuting Battleblades claim that Pal/Shm is the best duo in the game, and by his mention of nec/brd with afk warrior, I am assuming he meant best exp-grinding duo...which a pal/shm duo is FAR from.<br />
<br />
KEI lasts approx 4 hours with a decent focus and AA, 3.5+ for the average KEI bot on my server...<br />
<br />
9 lasts 1 hour 40 mins, and SD lasts only 45 mins...<br />
<br />
add in that there is often no one casting either of the latter buffs, and using them regularly while exping is just not feasable.  Getting a KEI before each session is pretty much the norm nowadays.<br />
<br />
So, for the average exp session a druid/bl combo would have KEI and SD and 9...that makes 31 mana/tick on BOTH toons, add in paragon as soon as it pops, and thats another 3 mana/tick....for a total of 34 mana/tick on BOTH toons.<br />
<br />
The cleric/warr-pal-sk duo would have KEI+yaulp (yaulping for 4 hours = suck) for 34 mana/tick on the cleric/14 on the other.<br />
<br />
As posted above, a beastlord/druid combo has:<br />
<br />
31-34 mana/tick regen<br />
102 hp/tick regen (Iksar/troll+Replin+Nat Rem+AA = 18+40+30+5)<br />
65% slow<br />
50% haste<br />
5khp pet, quads for 79, regens ~275hp/tick non-combat with 760 point LDoN aug<br />
3k nukes<br />
500+ tick in dots between the two<br />
<br />
Level 65 bst/dru pair would mow down tier2 mobs like there is no tomorrow, and with a few AA, the beast could get by with only regen+paragon+spirit of wood for heals, while still doing over 2x the dps of the pal/shm duo at the very minimum.<br />
<br />
Back on topic, Warrior/Shaman is the best duo of all the priest classes.</div></div><hr />
