<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Drirry Sappho</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">In Press Releases or on the personal website discussing all materials related they have said they are raising the Level-cap, what people don't understand is it has never been said what they are raising it to, only that they are raising it.. it could be from 66 to 7,000 noone has anyway of knowing and Brenlo isn't going to relate what they are going to raise it to.. I don't understand where this 70 or 75 came from but it is a total guess based on misinformation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, they can't raise it too high in one expansion.  If they do, then even places like PoP will start greening out and level 80 or 85 or higher characters will be single grouping and duoing raid content all over the place.  Realistically unless they offer a whole lot more content than they released with GoD, they can't really go much higher than 70 and leave much of a game to be played.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Drirry Sappho</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Since Verant's buyout I don't think trivializing raid content is high on their priority, PoP already turned the Sebilis King into a Solo encounter when it was a Raid encounter and then by Velious a Group encounter. Sony seems urgent to keep players interested in EQ long enough to move them on to EQ2, so what if EQ is full of bugs? so what if balance is screwed up and content trivialized.. they hardly seem to care anymore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It has been stated that EQ2 is going to be oriented toward the casual player and EQ will remain the basis for its more hardcore gamer base.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Haven't seen anything official, but the rumor I heard was that they were debating between level 68 and 70 for the cap.  I think that most people assume 70 because they raised it by 5 last time, but nobody really knows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Throag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">What I would like is that the new lvl cap is only active in OoW zones.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>irmingnomers</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The true misconception of OOW is that they really need another expansion to be shipped alreadyq</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'd bet 70. They won't raise it too far, too scared to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">My bet is on 7,000.  Come on guys, you don't KNOW what they're gonna raise it too, and thinking logically about it isn't going to prove it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'm thinking 68 or 70.</div></div><hr />

Raising level is a stupid idea, so hope it is 68 instead of 70, if it is between those 2.</div></div><hr />

<br />
New tutorial for players which walks you through the game intuitively (this is being tested on the Test server at this time for those of you who want to take a peek at it).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;The EverQuest development team is always striving to challenge our player base with compelling and creative content and they will do just that with the latest expansion,&quot; said Michael Lustenberger, executive director of marketing and public relations, Sony Online Entertainment. &quot;With an increased player level cap, task system and all new Epic weapons, Omens of War is sure to provide all new challenges and rewards for players of all levels.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Hate to say it, but the above description of the new expansion sounds like ass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kaesorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Yay, a new tutorial!<br />
<br />
Honestly that's about the most interesting thing I see on there for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">What, old tutorial was too complicated for the noobs?<br />
<br />
You have a druid port you around that little area now instead of doing all that walking?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">yeah really haass; and the druid can kite that damn black wolf around that you have to kill too !! and god forbid walking over the bridge !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">The old tutorial was taken out long ago because people were hacking it to explore zones that they couldn't access in game.  Of course the cat's already out of the bag on this, but trying to sell the replacement tutorial as part of an expansion is pretty cheesy since it use to come with the original game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Alisdahre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">but trying to sell the replacement tutorial as part of an expansion is pretty cheesy since it use to come with the original game.<br />
<br />
No doubt.  Especially since it's an &quot;expansion&quot;, meaning that anyone paying for this tutorial has already owned EQ prior to this and doesn't need a tutorial anymore.  What are they thinking?  The new tutorial should be nothing more than a patch day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Goradain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">/shrug<br />
<br />
I've recently come to terms with the fact that the reasons I had for playing EQ have been gimped, patched or expansioned out of the game at this point.  The excitement simply is no longer there.  When Vellious came out, it was exciting.  When Luclin came out, it was still exciting.  When PoP came out it was... something new.  GoD didn't even interest me.  OoW, to me, is the final nail in the coffin.  The game has become a convoluted, over-complicated PoS with almost no sense of accomplishment at all (for me anyway).  I got 10 AAs last week (all in LR).  It made no noticable difference in my tanking ability.  I also earned several hundred LDoN points, with which I still can't get anything I need.<br />
<br />
I think at this point I'm just treading water until WoW comes out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>tipoytm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">So... there actually are no new zones???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Plumppoopsie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">If they raise min lvl, there has to be new zones.<br />
<br />
Or maybe there plan to get people out of PoP and into GoD</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Dobbanz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">The statement posted earlier didnt mention it but there will also be an epic 2.0 which, btw will not require completing or handing in your old epic. Its supposed to be the current equivalent of difficulty of the original epics when they first came out. So get alot of friends together to kill the numerous Time level mobs for each quest lol.<br />

You think you get to choose your own, or are there going to be 400,000 randomly generated titles, or are there going to be tons of people all running around with the same title? Not a hugely important issue, but I'm curious about it.</div></div><hr />

here it is--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
 eqforums.station.sony.com...redir=true<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
in there youll find some sort of info on it and the fact that if you have your old epic you get to keep it because it isnt part of the quest at all.......there for epic v 2.0 is another quest all together<br />

YOU DO NOT NEED YOUR FIRST EPIC TO GET YOUR SECOND EPIC. <br />
<br />
This is confirmed by board mods (that work for EQ) on the official EQ Message Board. They have hinted that getting Epic 2.0 will be EASIER if you have Epic 1.0, but it IS NOT REQUIRED. Use Dev Tracker if ya wanna find the post.<br />
<br />
As for the lvl cap... I'm PRETTY SURE that when they had the news release about it, on the main EQlive website, there was a little blurb next to the OoW link that used to say that the new cap was 70 (it has since changed to &quot;level cap increase above 65&quot;).</div></div><hr />

So lemme rattle your brain with this one. <br />
<br />
Easier means less work, in terms of EQ.  It means less people, less time invested, and always has.<br />
<br />
If quest A is easier if also have done quest B, it means that quest B is a subcomponent of quest A.  I can think of no instance where this isn't the case.  <br />
<br />
Add that to the fact that I don't believe a damned word that anyone from SoE says, because I think they talk out of their ass a whole lot, and we have the conclusion I have arrived at -- 2nd epic involves the turn in of the first.  It's easier if you already have the first, because then you don't have to do the first.<br />
<br />
So what other instance, in EQ terms here, would mean that Quest A was easier if you do quest B?  Especially if Quest B is the first Epic, which made no change to your character (via tradeskills or such).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">It would be fairly easy to implement. For instance, in the rogue epic, if the general drops the quill, you can bypass a large section of the quest. They could design the quest so that to get a required quest piece, you could turn in your old epic, or do an alternate quest to get the same piece.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're more than welcome to take a pessimistic outlook on what more than one SOE employee has said, but it's pretty childish if you can't trust people over basic information.<br />
<br />
Has SOE gotten things wrong in the past? yup<br />
<br />
Will they in the future? maybe<br />
<br />
Are you still paying them to play? most likely<br />
<br />
If you are, why are you paying people you dont trust to play a game they created?<br />
<br />
If not, why are you on these boards spreading your distrust over a game that you no longer partake in?<br />
<br />
You're simply never going to enjoy yourself in game if you're too wrapped up in trying to find SOE lies and conspericies. Go play EQ and stop worrying about things you'll never trust anyway. btw... i heard your mailman was out to get you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To make it easier wouldn't involve turning in of your old epic. Same SOE employees have said that you will be able to equip both 1st and 2nd epic at the same time. <br />
<br />
Now for the pessimists out there... lemme get this out of the way... I HIGHLY DOUBT this means that you'll turn in your epic to make epic 2.0 easier, then you'll have to get epic 1.0 again to be able to equip both. Take what the devs are sayin at face value and don't read too much into it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Dobbanz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Here is the direct quote from the soe boards from an soe rep.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Epic 2.0 is an entirely new quest and a new weapon.  You will not need to turn in your first epic to complete the quest for the new one. <br />
Ashlanne Barefoot <br />
Sony Online Entertainment <br />
<br />
Here is another one, farther down the post from another rep<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Epic 2.0 is completely different quest.  Having the original epic will not be a requirement for completing the Epic 2.0 quest.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Ky<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
There, plainly spoken, from two seperate reps, epic 2.0 is in no way connected to the original epics aside from being reffered to as an epic weapon.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">I'm not too worried about a level cap increased.  They raised the cap to 60 for Kunark and it turned out to be a great expansion.  They increased the level cap to 65 for Planes of Power and it turned out to be one of the best expansions yet (besides the Rathe Council debacle).  If they raise the cap to to 70, then they'll make new content to challenge a level 70.  I mean, seriously, how much fun is it really to keep going back to the old content and keep raping it?  Who cares.  The only thing you and everyone else cares about in EQ is the sense of progression and the ability to move on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Gimmel makes a good point, bravo.  Forgot about the Quill, altho we always did the whole quest anyway since he never dropped that damned thing.<br />
<br />
Aegorian however, when confronted with logic, resorts to the &quot;OMG Y R U STILL PAYING FOR THIS GAME YOU HATE?&quot; argument.  <br />
<br />
It's not a conspiracy theory.  I know some of you people think SoE can do know wrong and would still play their games even if they came to your door and kicked your ass once a month, but the rest of the people know the MO.  Timesinks, false advertisements, repeated bullshit.  I don't have to have a theory, they provide the facts.  Predicting a continuing track record doesn't take a psychic at this point you know.<br />
<br />
I should also add that if the original particle weapons are not involved, then maybe some people around here should stop refering to them as epic v 2.0, because if you're gonna do that, well then we should start calling the Bloodfrenzy &quot;BoC 2.0.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Dobbanz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">To be honest, i can see why they are calling it epic 2.0 after all, it IS an epic weapon, in fact, its the second epic weapon quest that has been implemented. I do see how that might cause confusion but at least now you have seen some official word on the matter so everyone can relax about having to go back to pos for epic drops lol.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Aegorian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">btw... i found this a bit ago browsing through EQ sites. Here's a snippit of the official EQ press release regarding OoW:<br />
<br />
&quot;SAN DIEGO, CA – May 6, 2004 – Sony Online Entertainment Inc. (SOE), a worldwide leader in massively multiplayer online gaming, today announced EverQuest®: Omens of War, a new expansion for the incredibly popular PC Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG), EverQuest®. This expansion will feature new high-level Epic weapons while raising the player level cap to level 70. EverQuest players will also enjoy a new visual appearance thanks to the use of the new next-generation graphics engine. EverQuest: Omens of War is scheduled to be available at retail and for digital download from Sony Online Entertainment for $29.99 in July.&quot;<br />
<br />
unless the source i got this from was misquoting the news release... there's a pretty good chance we'll be seeing 70 come the end of July. Hope this clears things up!<br />
