<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sikkorak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My guild is coming up and starting to work on RZtW.  So, I am hoping for a BoW in the near future, but I have a question.<br />
<br />
Does the BoW proc more than other 2h weapons ?<br />
I assume that the BoW procs more than a similarily proc'ing 1h weapon (both with EB for ex.), is this true ?<br />
Anyone have parses for BoW vs.  GBoS+CHSD w(anger2/3) ?<br />
<br />
And lastly, general thoughts:<br />
<br />
BoW + anger3 (soon as I get this it will aug it)<br />
OR<br />
GBoS(anger)+CHSD(anger3)<br />
<br />
OR<br />
Spend a ton of cash or hope on a BoC drop for<br />
BoC(anger3)+CHSD(anger3)<br />
<br />
I am really looking at end game aggro, as we are poised for elementals, and probably won't want to upgrade or really can, until Time.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your thoughts.<br />

Seriously, BoW will make your head spin when you use it. It's that good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Smohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I went from a BF/SoD to a BoW - the aggro change wasnt drastic but I noticed that the BoW held aggro even if I didnt get many procs.<br />
<br />
BF had ok DPS but nothing that would get noticed without a proc. The BF proc rate seems really high though and its what I use on the emperor/seru with a bane in the offhand. I could see myself using the BF again with the new shield improvements against mobs with nasty procs that I want to avoid. The aggro is pretty good.<br />
<br />
DPS? - you wont find dual weild weapons outside of time that will match the BoW I dont think. Most of BoW aggro comes from the increased DPS Im sure.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I should proc 1.5times that of a BoW with AngerIII. That means also I will proc sooner on the average as well. <br />

wonder how you figure that out. On average I should proc 6 times at 30 seconds.... one time at 5 seconds on the average???? <br />
<br />
Oh I see ok 3 before and 3 after the middle time of 30 seconds mean a average time to proc once of 10 seconds, think... <br />
<br />
For BoW it would be 15 seconds, meaning I should get 600ish hate 5 seconds sooner, and 1200ish extra hate over 1 minute. I cannot see how BoW extra DPS can make up 1200 hate over 1 mintues.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sam DeathWalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Well Just looking at BoC(A3) vs. GSo4W(A3). The offhand DD is negligable agro (unless the DD has a stun).<br />
<br />
<br />
BoC is like 2 times a minute procs in main hand and i htinks the GSo4W would be 2.25 or sos. So the A3 procs on both are about even with the GSo4W having a little bit of edge.<br />
<br />
But the EB proc of the BoC is way better then the DD proc of the GSo4W. Of course the GSo4W will do more DPS and get agro that way... <br />
<br />
So I would give the edge to the BoC in that set up. And if you can A3 the offhand or get an offhand with some good agro proc (or both) then all the more better..... In fact even a CHoS whould be fine offhand...</div></div><hr />

There is more to warrior taunt output then just hate procs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kilaara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">When I am not the MT I start the following way.<br />
1. use my 2h Primal until proc ( ATK not maxed )<br />
2. switch to a GSot4W with a 125 Poison DD Augment.<br />
<br />
We have around 5 Knights with a SEWS all others are using BBB or GSot4w .. <br />
<br />
Mostly when MT dies I am nr 2 or 3 ( sometimes a monk is nr. 2 ) on the Hate list. ( No taunt no kick but additional the globe proc out of VT )<br />
<br />
So I think the GSot4W with an anger 3 would be a nice package for aggro and it should alltime equal a boc with anger 3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Sam DeathWalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">A bow would pull agro off of your bazaar aug'd weaps easily. There is more to warrior taunt output then just hate procs.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Well naturally DPS produces agro.... What else generates hate besides taunt, incite, DPS and hate procs, that warriors can do, or more spicfically a BoW can do? <br />
<br />
<br />
The only hate that a BoW can generate are DPS and its Proc from what I can see....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kilaara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Sam ask yourself the following question.<br />
<br />
Why do ppl. who had a BF (best 1h aggro pre time) and a HG/BBotE/BoC) use 99 % of their time a BoW when they want aggro? Hm..... cause theire stupid?<br />
<br />
So we had nearly 4 EB procs on dual wield and 2 on BoW and BoW is winner.<br />
<br />
Now put augments on them. You get 3 procs augment dual wield and 2 procs on a BoW. Do you really think that this 1 proc would change it? <br />
<br />
You will know how good a BoW is when you can use it. But dont try to tell us - that we have access to these weapons - that they are better than a BoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Sam DeathWalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I really dont follow yur argument. Its not about being stupid or not stupid its about what is the reason that a BoW will out agro a 1HS with the same proc. <br />
<br />
Im not telling anyone anything. I have read the parseing and it seems that the rule of thumb is that 1H together proc 3 times a mintue and 2H (including BoW) will proc 2 times a minute. Is that wrong or right? Now augment all 3 weapons and we have 6 proces per mintue with the 1h's and 4 procs per minute with the 2Hder, is that wrong or right.<br />
<br />
6 procs (assuming all the procs are equal hate generation) will out agro 4 procs. 2 extra 600 hate procs is 1200 extra hate per minute, not a small amount. <br />
<br />
Now maybe the proc rate on a BoW is greater then a BoC or OSOW. But from what I have read, unlike say a bf or a bbb, the BoW has the standard 2 proc per minutes.... <br />
<br />
Have these people who have access to these weapons put AugIII on both their mainhand and offhand to test. I kinda doubt that considering AugIII is a lot of work to get and if someone had a BoW they would put the AugIII on the BoW, and not even attempt to AugIII a BoC and whatever. Who has earned 3 AugIII's anyway? Maybe before LDoN and the AugIII's tests were done comparing a BoW to a BoC/BF or whatever set up, but now we have AugIII's to toss in the mix.<br />
<br />
Does anyone actually own two weapons with good inate hate procs, that they have put AugIII on both, and also own a BoW with AugIII? Let them come forth and say what their experience has been.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Niafix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Sam, open your eyes. ============= 48/32</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Jedediah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Well, you don't need them augmented to prove it.<br />
<br />
Unaugmented, the BoW is out-proc'd at a 3:2 ratio (EDIT: I noticed you used a 3:2 ratio initially, too, whereas I had 2:1 here. Your math makes more sense to me that way, but the logic still stands, the proc ratio remains the same regardless of augments).<br />
<br />
Augmented, it's still only a 3:2 ratio.<br />
<br />
Logically, the unaugmented match-up should as strong for the one-hander set up as the augmented. Augmenting all the weapons being discussed does nothing for the one handed weapon set-ups proc advantage (which I might add is the ONLY advantage this set up has, unless we're counting a few measely hp).<br />
<br />
That being the case, I'm sure someone with a BF and BoC/HG also owns a BoW, and can give us the story Sam needs to hear. BoW owns the 1 handed EB weapons, and I'm eagerly awaiting mine. RZ hasn't dropped any for us yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Who has earned 3 AugIII's anyway?Are you kidding? My twink has over 5k points earned and I only play him part time. It is not unusual for raid guild warriors to have well over 100 missions (we have people with over 400 in my guild) which is plenty to augment several weapons multiple times. I don't have a BoW, but you can bet that if I somehow luck in to one, I will gladly bag my augmented BoC+GBoS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Baam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Sam<br />
<br />
Presuming that you augment both the 1handers and 2hander with Anger III. I do follow your logic and you are right that after the ldon expansion the 1handers are getting more procs than a 2hander from the simple fact that offhand procs too, while the agro from melee is totally unchanged.<br />
<br />
More explanation:<br />
Weapons generate agro through it's melee and procs. Bow gets a considerable amount of it's agro through melee, where bf and boc are more dependent on procs. <br />
The ratio on procs might be the same 3:2 between 1handers and 2hander, so there is already a surplus on procs to 1handers. <br />
Now put numbers in the proc ratio:<br />
<br />
3:2................Diff<br />
500:333.....= 167<br />
800:533.....= 267<br />
2000:1333.= 667<br />
<br />
Ldon insceased the numbers in the ratio by adding a proc more to each weapon. As you can see the hard numbers on the differens increases, and gives 1handers a greater benifit from the additional augments than 2hander.<br />
<br />
That said it doesn't give a conclusion on what is best.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Sam <br />
<br />
BoC PPM = 2<br />
Offhand PPM = 1<br />
Anger 3 PPM = 2+1 <br />
<br />
So you are up to 6PPM<br />
<br />
BoW = 2 PPM<br />
Anger 3 = 2 PPM<br />
<br />
Thats 1 proc per 10 sec vs 1 proc per 15 sec.<br />
<br />
There is a difference. <br />
Of course you will be able to draw agro off and augmented BoW.<br />
And quite easily too.<br />
<br />
However you will need a good series of procs.<br />
And your agro will be less reliable than a BoW.<br />
<br />
BoC+SoD + Anger3 x2 Will probably outagro a BoW often.<br />
The sheer agro potential is much higher (6 vs 4 PPM).<br />
<br />
If i would use numbers i would say (its an example)<br />
BoW = 90 110 100 120 90 130 110 Agro<br />
Sam's Combo = 80 130 70 140 50 80 150 80 Agro<br />
<br />
Thats is why you see everyone saying BoW agros very well.<br />
Its not the weapon with the best agro potential.<br />
But its very good and above all non streaky.<br />
<br />
<br />
PS : My GL had :<br />
Bloodfrenzy (not augmented) &amp; Coirnav (Anger3 augmented)<br />
<br />
So its Tweaked EB +  DD150/Anger3<br />
<br />
Not as good as your current proposal but 16/20 &amp; 19/20<br />
<br />
And with an augmented BoW i would keep agro off him 90% of the time.<br />
<br />
(We both have SoPM so he got extra procs from it)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Jedediah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">We're not talking that order of magnitude, however, Baam. We're talking about going from 1 proc every 15 (1hs) or 20 (2hs) seconds, to one proc every 10 (1hs) or 15 (2hs) seconds. It's more procs, but at the same rate as prior to augmentation. Basically, it balances out before and after augmentation. Aside from that, it's a still completely at the mercy of the RNG. The BoW damage is much more reliable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Baam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Jedediah<br />
<br />
Once more.<br />
Ldon doubled the potential proc rate on each weapon.<br />
<br />
Ldon help 1handers on agro, because they have a higher base number of procs.<br />
<br />
Example <br />
If we let the proc ratio between 1handers and 2hander be<br />
- 3 vs 2<br />
<br />
We do then double the proc rate<br />
- 6 vs 4<br />
<br />
1handers get 3 procs added.<br />
2hander get 2 procs added.<br />
<br />
The agro connected to the melee part is totally unchanged. Only the procs have changed and 1handers gets 1 proc more than 2handers after ldon.<br />
<br />
I don't think I can make it more clear.<br />
<br />
Still remember I am not saying anything about, which is best for practical use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Sam DeathWalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Dont have time to respond in full but to point one thing..<br />
<br />
Yes the 3:2 ration is the same. But as you increase the numbers you increase the addtional hate over time.<br />
<br />
Prior to LDoN you had 600 extra hate per minute on the one handers. (1 extra procs) <br />
<br />
After LDoN you have 1200 extra hate per mintues on the two handers. (2 extra procs)<br />
<br />
So after LDoN you have 600 more hate per mintue then prior. So tests taken prior will not incude this 600 more hate per minute.<br />
<br />
<br />
At any rate we will see I goona Aug them and test against antoehr warrior with augmented BoW sometime in a week or two.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Spliskin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I think the important point is not whether an augmented BoW or  augmented BF/HG is more agro.  Both setups clearly have enough agro to do the job.  Heck, my augmented HG/unaugmented BoC holds agro great, even before the additon of Incite. The problem is riposte damage. <br />
<br />
The Blade of War is clearly a better choice if its an available option.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Sam DeathWalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">No argument there. BoW blows away 1H for preventing repostate damge. <br />
<br />
I was just looking at agro only.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Ygnir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Maybe you need to take into account that a bow blows any non-time dual combo away in such a magnitude that proc's are just icing on the cake..... ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Beomur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I dual wield BF and BoC atm, advantage of being on server that dosent have nodrop, (FV), I have used a BoW many times while tanking. Yea I dual wield EB, I dont have aggro problems, but yes after using BoW and seeing the dps increase to help with aggro and awsome proc rate, I cant wait to get my damn BoW, my BF will be bagged until like what somebody else said, they  fool with shields and makes them usefull, only time i ever equip shiled is like when i click up a floor in VT and things might get hairy for abit or im ramp tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Uukla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I think another Issue is that people who get a BoW will have ferocity, Flurry, and Punishing blade.  The increased number of swings from the offensive AAs will give signifigantly more agro to the BoW.<br />
Both weapon sets would take advantage of the extra swings, but a extra swing from a BoW would be MUCH more agro each swing than ANY 1 hander.<br />
<br />
Add this agro advantage combined with less repost damage and more dps, and you have why you might want to go with a BoW over 2 1 handers with 4 agro procs.<br />
<br />
(also I think this would also mean you might actually see a loss of agro that you would notice if you did not have the offensive AAs.  But who cares?  If you can get the BoW when you lack AAs, thats insane.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Sam DeathWalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">All these are ligit arguments for sure.<br />
<br />
As I see it 1200 hate per minute is equal to 20dps, making the assumption that 1hate = 1damage, which has been far from proven but who knows and it seems the best estimate we have now. <br />
<br />
Is the obviously greater DPS of the BoW more then a 20 increase in dps. Naturally if you have all the AA to increase the BoW dps, you should also have all the AA to increse the Duel Wield DPS also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Kilaara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Sam its totally without any interest if a pre plane dual wield combo with augments and as an addition you forgot an extra proc out of VT ( orb or gloves ) which would bring it to 6 procs BoW and around 9 procs dual wield will outaggro a BoW or not.<br />
<br />
Fakts are.<br />
<br />
1. When you fight one of the higher PoP Bosses with dual wield you will die earlier .... thats bad.<br />
2. When you can hold aggro with a Lippstick in one hand and an icecube in the other hand in almost all situations, ppl will be glad.<br />
3. When you can dish out a real amount of damage with your weapon(s) to kill the mobs faster, ppl. will be glad.<br />
<br />
So lets see.<br />
<br />
Survive on a raid --- Winner is the BoW<br />
Holding aggro in a Ldon .... Both will do it<br />
Dishing out nice damage -- Winner is the BoW<br />
<br />
And I think when you -- or some other warrior Level 65 - will be in one group with an BoW wielding - maybe elemental or time flagged - warrior there is only one choice for the tank and thats the BoW wielder cause his hitpoints and armorclass should be superieur to yours. And therefore is no point for you to try to steal aggro. As a warrior of qualtity its now your job do pull out your damage dealing toys.<br />
<br />
So this diskussion is a theorism not more.<br />
<br />
Btw. more hate than beeing on the top is not comparable to lesser dps.<br />
<br />
In the last 2 hard Ldons I normally had to taunt 1 to 2 times per fight with the following groups ( enc nec nec wiz cle war ( all elemental equipped ) and enc nec nec rng clr war ( all elemental equipped). Btw. that was with an unaugmented BoW with the extra prod from the orb out of VT. Chanter was pulling.<br />
<br />
And you can see in my magelo that I have all the AAs for 2h but not all AAs for dual wield ( no ambidex ) so its not naturally to have both.</div></div><hr />
