<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Binnamar</div><div class="date">07-23-2003, 05:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Which of the 2 are more challenging. I'm guessing the BoT tower bosses, as they are more up to date expansion wise, and NToV would fall behind in difficulty for a guild.<br />
<br />
Anyone give me a general idea of their toughness also?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">07-23-2003, 05:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hard to say for me since I've been out of ntov for over a year.<br />
<br />
I would think NToV is still much more chalenging since you cant skip content with pacify and just move raid to boss mob. The boss mobs themselves in BoT are damn ez too plus the advantage of outdoor zone. SoW, kiting space, Blah blah. I'd say tov is harder since you have to have knowledgable pullers. Know ways to deal with AEs and all that other stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vigdis SangCaru</div><div class="date">07-23-2003, 05:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Generally, I'd say that the encounters are roughly equal in difficulty.  Bosses are more difficult to kill, but dragons have far more hitpoints b/c they were created when Verant thought to make an encounter difficult it must simply give the mob a supid amount of hit points and often silly AE's (God I hate Lady Nev with an undying passion...ohwait, Aufflie does the same thing...). <br />
<br />
Specifically, I'd say it depends on the dragon and the Boss.  Kuanbyr is hard and there is no way around it.  This is because you have to figure out how to negate the three linked pets that come with him.  Additionally, if you have no good lull team, his tower is far more difficult with the PB AE Skygges (or however you spell it).  Brynju-something is also difficult because of his rampage but once you work that out he's as easy as Aufflie or Einride, both of whom are pretty straightforward fights.  I'd rather do 5 million gazillion Aufflies than one more Lady Nev. <br />
<br />
As with most NTOV dragons, the trick to BOT bosses is just making sure your clerics can hit the complete heal button in something similar to a pattern.  With BOT bosses you just have less chances to screw up because the fight doesn't last as long.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">07-24-2003, 03:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i think flurry drakes are the hardest part of ntov, and few of the pulls. theres only about 3 ntov dragons that are remotely difficult - the middle triplet(forget the name), lady nev, and lord vyemm.<br />
<br />
theres a few tricks to BoT towers too, but once u got how to do the pulls down, the mobs themselves require 3-5 groups. mostly its healing your tanks outside of ae range and finding a good spot to pull to and possibly cr for quick 2nd attempt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zhisz</div><div class="date">07-24-2003, 04:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd agree with Ludor, flurry drakes and stopping gaters has been my guilds biggest problems in ntov. Bring a bard, and the middle triplet isnt that hard anymore. The new fast heals gimp Lord Vyemm and Lady Nev is easy as long as theres no repops that gate on you :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jedediah</div><div class="date">07-24-2003, 08:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Towers are ridiculously easy once you get them down.   Paci/HoN are nice, not to mention that it's a lot easier just to get to BoT than out in the middle of WW when you're KoS to everything on the way there.  Plus you don't need a necro if things go badly (I mean really, really badly). <br />
<br />
Incidentally, the skygge AE is directional, not PB, so stick your tank in a corner and keep him alive.   The only tricky part really is Kuanbyr and his pals (although if you don't know how to pull Brynju, he can be tricky too).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Binnamar</div><div class="date">07-24-2003, 09:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Would it be a better idea to farm BoT (what we can of it anyways) then go back and hit up NToV? Or would the gear we get from BoT make NToV worthless?</div></div><hr />

The gear there is much better than NToV(FT for casters, goo daggro weapons for melee, etc etc) But NToV is also very good gear in its own right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">07-24-2003, 11:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">BoT is easy to do cause the mobs are always up.  I think its 6-8 hour respawn so usually all four mobs are up and you can hit them all in a few hours.  Plus BoT is a good mix of int caster, priest and melee loot.  NToV tends to have too much melee loot and lots of NToV loot is simply outdated and rots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cenyen</div><div class="date">07-24-2003, 12:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Like SUlvar said, atleast 50% of NToV is worthless... only BoT item i ever saw rot was a gargoyle talon and that is because no rogue was on in guild</div></div><hr />

<br />
Incidentally, the skygge AE is directionalThere is no such thing as a directional AE. There are exactly 2 type - point blank AE and targeted AE. People who think AE is directional are usually the first to get raped by the Jord Skygges because they stand behind the mob, but still in AE range because the mob is cornered.<br />
<br />
This is how AEs work -<br />
<br />
Point blank AE - eminates from the caster outward 360 degrees for a specified range.<br />
<br />
Targeted AE - is cast on a targeted. There are 2 ranges associated - the range from the caster to the target, usually prettly long range, and the AE range which is measured from the target outward 360 degrees around the target. In the case of the Skygge AE, it has an AE range of 20 feet. So anyone within 20 feet of the MT is going to be hit - regardless of where they are standing in relation to the mob. You can have your head up the mobs ass, if you are within 20 feet of the MT, you are going to get hit.<br />
<br />
**edit - corrected AE range of Stone Gale.</div></div><hr />

just because its not one of the PC spells does not mean NPCs dont have that ability...</div></div><hr />

<br />
No theres really not.  Its exactly how wandor described it.  There is point blank &amp; there is targeted &amp; there is nothing else.  There is no directional ae, there is no cone shaped ae, there is no other ae type except for pb &amp; targered.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">07-24-2003, 03:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">you both obviously have not fought skygge mobs. or at least havent whiped to one.</div></div><hr />

plug in whatever spell youre getting hit with then come back &amp; tell us if its pb ae or targeted ae.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">07-24-2003, 04:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">think its Stone Gale (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=1031&amp;source=Live)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grimmlokk</div><div class="date">07-24-2003, 04:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">AE Range: 20 <br />
Target Type: Targeted AE <br />
<br />
 That means it hits anything within 20 feet of the target. MT being the target, unless someone has pulled agro. It doesn't matter what direction you aref rom the MT, as long as you are within 20 feet(or whatever the unit of measurement is) you will get hit. Period. End of story.<br />
<br />
 Lotsa call targetted AE's directional, it's a misnomer. From people behind the mob being out of range of the AE from MT they assume it only hits frontal things. Try Seru some time and tell me how directional the AE is. It's the exact same type, just 150 range instead of 20. Or corner one of those Skygge's and push it right on the MT, and stand *just* behind the Skygge=)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">07-24-2003, 04:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">thx for the info Casai ... you refuted your own statement with your link.<br />

And you are right, I have not wiped to the Skygges because I know how to avoid the AE. Grimlokk has it exactly correct. People corner the Skygges then stand right behind then - then wonder why they are eating AEs because they believe it's directional. I see it every time someone new goes on a tower raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">07-24-2003, 04:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">oh yeah, to answer the original question ...<br />
<br />
There really is not a lot of difference in difficulty in getting to the mobs these days. If you have a non-kos mage you can CoH right to Aary's spawn. If Aary is not up, you can get to the pit pretty easily. You do have to clear the flurries, but they are not the 1 mob wrecking crew they used to be. They can easily be tanked without defensive. Everything is super easy to pull single with the vastly decrease agro radius you have at 65. None of the named are particularly hard, and none of the AE are hard to contend with if you are 65 and you have a bard around. We did vyemm with 18 a couple of nights ago. Long fight, but not difficult.<br />
<br />
The tower named are also pretty easy to get to, in most cases you can lull your way to the boss. If you get struck clearing your way it, it kinda sucks because the mobs have quite a few HP and there are a lot of them. The bosses themselves are a higher difficulty than NToV dragons, however as someone already mentioned, they don't have nearly the amount of HP so the fights are a lot shorter.<br />
<br />
Tower bosses drop better loot, NToV bosses drop more loot. I guess it's a matter of priority. If you need to equip a lot of people in one shot, you will get a lot more loot in 1 NToV clearing than you will in 1 tower boss clearing. However, the tower bosses will be up 6 hours later. They are completely different enounters, you might as well do both if you can manage to get some mobs up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grimmlokk</div><div class="date">07-24-2003, 06:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">BoT drops are far superior. If it's an either/or proposition I'd say BoT definately. The best non-Vulak drop in NToV would be Cloak of Thorns I think. Or Onyx Gauntlets from Vyemm, maybe Belt of the Destroyer from Dagarn if you need haste. All 3 very rare drops(1 belt, 1 cloak, 0 gaunt for us in 10+ killings of everything there). BoT bosses all have multiple very nice drops. Other than Auliffe's paladin 1HS there's no real blatant throw away drops. So basically on a really good run through NToV over 4 hours or so(not sure time, haven't done it in ages) you could get 3-6 real good drops if you were monumentally lucky, more likely 0-1. Buncha marginal to useless drops as well. Or BoT in 1.5-4(depending on harmony/pac and your force) you get 4-8 very good drops(they drop 2 items every time now?). And probably an ornate chest or two.</div></div><hr />

I corner skygges to keep other people from taking the AE.<br />
<br />
I appreciate the correction though, thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kellaen</div><div class="date">07-24-2003, 11:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They drop 2 items, tho ornate bp patterns can take up one or both of them. Easily BoT towers &gt; NToRot</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">07-25-2003, 03:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">its worth your time to kill up to dagarn in ntov if you are in a time crunch. you normally get your best drops from eashen, aary, and dagarn. its a great raid zone to do at least once either way though.<br />
<br />
i would probably kill up to dagarn, TL out to kill the BoT towers, poi spider factory mobs, or do the poi dragon.<br />
<br />
our server still has several guilds doing ntov though, like ppl said, BoT is available everyday like vindicator. i think u can do the dragon every 2 hours in poi and the spiders are 3day spawns.<br />
<br />
you should of course be watching for Itraes viteaus, rhrag1 and 2, vindicator if u you need bps, statue, and tormax too. tormax alone is normally worth killing more so than the entire zone of ntov.<br />
<br />
what it sounds like is you got a raid day picked out and are trying to decide which one to do, i would tend to bet the ntov mobs arent going to there waiting for you, 7 day spawns and most likely someone has already killed them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Binnamar</div><div class="date">07-25-2003, 07:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, NToV is currently not being done on my server (unless someone has moved in very recently). The stuff is only getting killed when there is nothing else to do, so there is little competition.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kendolekk</div><div class="date">07-25-2003, 08:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We kill it occasionally binnamar. We been thinkign about giving RoV a try, for shits and giggles. In order to do RoV, all named have to be down or something. We won't be doing it much longer though, I am sure.<br />
<br />
NToV is really all about strategy. Positioning on mobs is key (Aary comes to mind). Got to have people on their toes and ready for flurries. Think we used Aary's hallway as our CoH spot. If you have any other questions just /t me in game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nokmgud</div><div class="date">08-01-2003, 04:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guild is currentlyy doing both, BoT towers and NToV.  BoT bosses drop nice stuff, but we are starting to get &quot;full&quot; since most people have the drops.  Most NToV stuff is pretty marginal for our top players, but there is a lot of stuff in a relatively short raid time, once you have figured out how to move rapidly from named to named.  And there are a lot of newer players that can still get upgrades, TSBS is better then Windblade, onyx chain is great for chain classes, sprinkler of spirits beats shaman epic.  There is just a greater variety of loot in NToV then the BoT bosses.</div></div><hr />

Out of 60+ boss kills since loot patch I have seen only maybe 10 drop 2 items. <br />
<br />
And yeah BoT&gt;ToV and vastly less time consuming and vastly easier. <br />
<br />
Chaoswind: Lull up. 12 can do him easy, 6 isn't too hard. Get clerics extended range items to keep out of AE or bring more healers.<br />
Thunderclap: Lull up. Work out how to pull him. 18 people easy, 12 ok.<br />
Icestorm: Lull up as much as possible. Watch for mobs the other side of the portal. Ridiculously easy fight. Keep casters out of AE. 6 people np, 12 is a walkover.<br />
Hailstorm: Lull up. Hint for the adds - Bards! 18 easy, 12 ok. Slightly easier than TC.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Kubby isn't so hard.  We mez Iri, solo tank Kubby, slow and solo tank Hrani, and we all pile on and kill Liestr first, as he's unslowable.  Once he's dead the fight gets a lot simpler, we kill Hrani next.  By this time MT defensive is down, but we just speed up heals a little and push Kubby into a corner like AOW and he's toast.<br />

I'd agree with Ludor, flurry drakes and stopping gaters has been my guilds biggest problems in ntov. Bring a bard, and the middle triplet isnt that hard anymore. The new fast heals gimp Lord Vyemm and Lady Nev is easy as long as theres no repops that gate on you :D <br />
<br />
Stopping gaters is easy enough, if you coordinate nuking.  At 25 life, have all nukers hold their spells, at 18% call for nukes, and everyone nukes at once.  This will generally drop the mob with one hammer punch, and it will never get a chance to cast.</div></div><hr />

In BoT you'll get ornate drops from time to time, but mostly what you get there are nice weapons.  Do NTOV for the 100 hp gear that drops there.</div></div><hr />

There's like 5 outside of  Vulak(Iki cloak, nev cloak, Fesh staff, Vyemm gloves, Cek Mace). 4 exceedingly rare + Fesh staff. Not counting 2H weapons or that lame Aary shield. The only one's I would say are really worth sweating are Nev Cloak and Vyemm gloves.</div></div><hr />
