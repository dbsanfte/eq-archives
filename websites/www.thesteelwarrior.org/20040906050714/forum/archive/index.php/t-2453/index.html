I haven't been on eq for a week which is amazing for me. What keeps you guys going from all the bs we have to put up with.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kelorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i quit a couple months ago and have since started logging back on, half hour, 45mins at a time. And i have no drive to stay on and play. I usually just sit in the bazaar and talk to friends that have pushed to 60+ and are in places i can't get to to group with them. So I look at prices, sell some stuff on and off, but that's pretty much it. The game has lost it's touch for me, mostly because i'm unguilded and don't have a regular group.<br />
<br />
Getting a new account and starting a SK in september though, to duo with my brother's shammy.  Will be headed to university so it'll act as a cheap way to keep in touch with my family, lol.<br />

When I came back, I found that I was &quot;mysteriously&quot; unguilded. I soldiered on, like a good lil' warrior, and with the help of those same friends, I am much happier today than I was before the break.<br />
<br />
If it wasn't for the daily group (all 2 hours of it :p), I wouldn't be playing now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mofu-Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I keep goin because im in a really unique situation ,i think , im the only warrior in a fairly large raid force of friends and friends of friends and i know im needed every night. It has some nice perks in that i usually get the cool new melee stuff first :)  I think if it wasnt for this situation im in , id have quit several months ago.<br />

To me, Vindi BP is an uber drop, anything above that is totally unacessible and very uber.<br />

I love raiding, but my guild does not raid often which I don't like but they are good people and I have been with them forever so I wont be leaving any time soon. I have this urge to join a raiding guild but I keep thinking that at lvl 61 with 4 AAs I'm not in a position to get whiny about being stuck because I can get levels and AAs anywhere and without them the best guilds wont take me anyway.</div></div><hr />

Ive quit a bunch of times but seems to like the troll the board.  Some new idea or equipment thoughts would come up and I would check it out and get hooked again.<br />
<br />
Only thing that I really really wanted outta this game was to finish my epic (yeah I know its sad).  But I finally got my lightsabers with the help of my guild, and now Im fighting for them.  Its nice to be back in a guild and raid again, and I'm called to MT at times.  Raids really make the warrior class shine!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Friends, self contained goals (level 65, AE taunt) used to raid, can no longer spend the time nor have the inclination to do so. I log on mostly on weekends when i get in early enough. Without the equipment that i gained whilst raiding (EB and other stuff) I would not have the ability to act as a free agent as i do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Spinetwist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">social aspect. I get to play in a virtual world with people I dont even know, and we solve problems and work together to achieve a common goal - this to me is the ultimate concept of fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Binnamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I'm still playing beacause, well, I'm not sure. I guess equipment upgrades keep the ball rolling, but chatting with friends and such pushes that ball a bit further.<br />
<br />
Like, just the other night... I got a CHSD. Before I got it, I would just log into the bazaar, do a quick /gu anyone need a warrior, and then log if not. The fact that I'm leading raids for my guild now probably also keep me going.<br />
<br />
There are a lot of factors that keep me going. It is impossible to list them all (mostly because I don't know what they are).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Veldriss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The people, definatly. That and I enjoy being a part of the best euro guild on my server. ;p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Greyslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I think the main thing that keeps me going is the friends I have.  Also since I joined a raiding guild it has made the game more fun due to new boss mobs I get to see.  My goal every since PoP has came out is to see Rallos Zek I think he is so cool looking :p Although when FF11 and WoW come out not sure if I will play EQ any longer or much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Grimmlokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">What keeps me going is having fun and not reading these bullshit doomsaying crybaby bitchass crippled little girl whiney fucking pussy-athons posted here 500 times a day. <br />

<br />
Helping people finish quests they have been working on for years.<br />
<br />
Recognizing that a lot of people that play this game do so because they want their in-game world to be better than the crap going on in their RL world and then having a DIRECT ability to fulfill that desire for them.<br />
<br />
That's what keeps me going.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Sivok Kovis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Habit alot of times.<br />
Other times I set goals, wether it be getting faction, a lvl or an AA point. Maybe just aquiring a peice or armor. The game it self does not push you in any direction, it forever is lvl to aquire, aquire to lvl, this can beat anyone down. Maybe is why I should have started on a PVP server. Now I am just to beat to start over. So I take it as I get it and complain when I get taken. <br />
<br />
Games with a set path and an end always seemed anticlimatic, now an end goal would almost be appreciated. EQ has found away to pull an expansion out often enough to keep me thinking there might be something to be interested in. Each time it takes a only a little time to see that it is the same thing as before, heck even the same mobs at times with a different name and a higher lvl. Point being I keep doing because there's nothing else to do online that interest me. I tried DAoC and it was ok but too small in content. Awaiting WoW at this point, if it sucks I will be right back here, might even try EQ2 hoping they do it right.<br />
<br />
Oh, There's a few people I enjoy talking to online as well, very few, sometimes helping them is enjoyable, sometimes now =\</div></div><hr />

To hang out with a very dear friend, although she hasn’t been on much lately damn that RL anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Mvreena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Friends in game, the love of role playing, the desire to see and do all the things that AL consideres a joke, definately some addiction.  It also helps that I took 18 months off when I had my daughter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>WittlesVaseel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">What keeps me playing is knowing that I can switch to another class to keep me entertained. The day that no class holds antertainment value for me, is the day I wipe my HD of EQ.</div></div><hr />
