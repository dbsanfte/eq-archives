..Who DOESN'T think we need some help?<br />
<br />
Btw, I am Azumaan.<br />
<br />
I like Usul's idea of giving Warrior's a low level Fear ability. I don't like it being an AA, something innate at level 50, same duration/distance restrictions as shield (duration increased just like the Meat Sheild AA) but it would have a 10/level*100 second reuse time. I hate to have to punch another hotkey, but what can you do.</div></div><hr />

Some of those arguments are pure bullshit.  Asking what Knights will bring to a party if they aren't the only tanks who can lock aggro instantly.  They bring a ton of other spells, roots, fd, res, heals, buffs, debuffs, etc, etc etc.<br />
<br />
Then statements like 'warriors shouldn't be the best tank in the game' ... that really shows how far warriors have sunk in EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valeris</div><div class="date">09-23-2003, 04:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Interesting that a number of shamans and now necros are suggesting knights need a 'mild nerf'. Especially when you consider how much they gain from aggro-lock.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ronaan</div><div class="date">09-23-2003, 04:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">not surprising at all.<br />
<br />
the necro boards are not those of the mild words, oh no. but the players sure have brains there. and anyone with at least half a brain can see what's wrong with warriors. and anyone with at least 3/4 of a brain can come up with ways to fix it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dureen</div><div class="date">09-23-2003, 02:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My necro passed my warrior for exactly those reasons.  In general I've found a lot of folks the necro community to be very selfabsorbed.  Every change, every add is another way they are keeping us (necros) down so when I logged on this morning and saw them commenting on warriors needing to be fixed I was shocked.  <br />
<br />
The warrior doesn't need to be fixed by AA, it goes much deeper than that.  They need to be fixed from about level 30 on up.  The warrior with ubergear and 100AAs while still needing help can at least hold his own, all be it poorly, against others.  It's the midlevel warrior who suffers the most.  The one played a few times a week with no time to AA or raid.  Fix them, adjust the tank at the base of the problem and the improvements will ripple upwards to those above.</div></div><hr />

The seem pretty fast to me, the board admin (The Vision, site designer, host provider.. closest thing to a necro god) spends alot of time optimizing code and such, I dunno what it all means, but he uses the word &quot;backend&quot; alot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think that it's sound advice anywhere to stay away from guys who spend too much time working on the &quot;backend&quot; of something.<br />
<br />
Not that there's anything wrong with that.</div></div><hr />
