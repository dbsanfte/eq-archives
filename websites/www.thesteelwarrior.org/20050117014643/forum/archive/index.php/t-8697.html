          My guild has had terrible luck when it comes to agro weapons ( 1 drop in 2-3 months).  The most likely upgrade for me agro weapon wise will come from SEWS, BBB , or another rune procing weapon pretty soon.  So my question is how much agro is rune (I have been told its some agro).  Is it worth to shoot for a SEWS or hold out and pray that our luck turns someday?  I am sure anything beats my stun procage atm.  This is all assuming it will have an anger 3 aug of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paen</div><div class="date">08-29-2004, 11:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">SEWS is nice, I did a test with rune agro back when I had a SEWS you can prolly find it here somewhere but I narrowed runes down to having a 1.5-2.3 agro multiplier iirc (never did finish the test to find out the exact multiplier since I got a VDD soon after that and didnt care anymore). Plus its ae agro off any mobs that are in range to 'see' it, the rune itself is nice for tanking also ofcourse. <br />
<br />
To this day I would still take a SEWS over a BoW without thinking twice about it.</div></div><hr />

Why?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paen</div><div class="date">08-30-2004, 12:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why?<br />
<br />
For all the resons I said in my original post  :p <br />
<br />
If rune3 augs were available on LDoN merchants I would take both anger3 augs out of my weapons and put rune3 in right now.<br />
<br />
To me the benefits of rune3 are much greater than the hate loss. I think rune agro multiplier is 2x but like I said I never finished my test, if it is then rune3 is 460 *ae* hate, well worth the hate loss and even better when multiple mobs are in camp which is a lot of the time. Especially now being able to augment SEWS with anger3 also, 90% of the time I had mine was before augments even.<br />
<br />
The only thing I didnt like about my SEWS was the ae taunt it caused when I didnt want it sometimes, like on certain events etc.. other than that it was wonderful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zynth</div><div class="date">08-30-2004, 05:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i have the elf shoe from primal reptile and the agro from the rune proc always seemed very crappy at best. this &quot;AE agro&quot; is a total waste, tash or slow can easily negage any agro you would of had from a whole battle of rune procs unless it's the mob your attacking. the closest estimate some one came up with (in this forum) a few months back was around 200-250 hate from a rune proc. from my experiance with rune that sounds like a fair estimate. a lot of the current rune weapons have very favorable damage ratios which is where i suspect most of the agro is being generated. <br />
<br />
personally, i'm not satisified with rune as an agro proc. i've never once seen a mob turn its attention to me from rune procs as opposed to a stun or even AC debuff.</div></div><hr />

Reagents are not necessary for the proc to work.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paen</div><div class="date">08-30-2004, 01:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heres the test I did way back when<br />
<br />
Two test mobs, each consisted of me pulling haven guards in netherbia with a succesful taunt, SK then casted terror of thule (+600 direct hate) 2x to gain agro from me (so initial agro bonus is between 601-1199?) then I would cast runes on my enchanter until I got agro and he would taunt with the taunt key at that point making us within 1 point of each other on the hate list and negating any initial agro bonus. At this point we had the following results both times<br />
<br />
2x thule (1201 hate) took 1 rune of zeb (850pt rune) to snap the guard to enchanter, SK then succesfully taunted<br />
<br />
2x thule (1201 hate) took 1 rune V (700pt rune) to snap the guard to enchanter, Sk then succesfully taunted<br />
<br />
1x thule (601 hate) took 2 rune 3 (230pt rune) to snap the guard to enchanter<br />
<br />
While this doesnt prove what the multiplier is, it does suggest there is definitely a multiplier and its higher than 1.7 and less than 2.6. Wish we had more time for the tests, hopefully we can do it again and find out the exact multiplier.<br />
<br />
If anyone wants to prove me wrong by all means be my guest, I would like to know the exact multiplier as well.<br />
<br />
And Haddion, heres the link to the thread that test came from which is all about SEWS vs BoW if you wanna take a look at more opinions of SEWS holders, you will notice anyone that actually used a SEWS never regretted it.<br />
