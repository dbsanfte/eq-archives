Lately, about the only time I've been using it is on a canning shaman I group with. He's pretty well geared, so the fact that his hitpoints weren't exactly leaping at the end of a bandage didn't seem significant. But last night I was running through a newbie zone and stopped to BW someone who was fighting there. I was getting the normal messages, and the bandages were being consumed, but the bandages were healing for zero hitpoints. Anybody else notice a BW problem very recently?</div></div><hr />

Its very strange, BW will work normally on myself but only heal for 25-30 hp on others.</div></div><hr />
