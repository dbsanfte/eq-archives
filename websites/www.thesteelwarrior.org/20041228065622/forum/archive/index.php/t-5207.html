<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">landrain</div><div class="date">01-15-2004, 08:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did my first couple perma-rooted mobs after the new incite changes. And while I love the incite skill.. I really think there is a problem being able to use it on these mobs. <br />
<br />
We did Carpin cycle. Bishop Avhi and High Priest Ultor are both permarooted. Due to the coding/summon rules etc. I was free to use incite on each mob at will with no repercusions. I used it approximately 5 times each, before engageing the mob. At this point, the mobs didnt even know anyone else was even in the room. I could stand there not attacking, not doing anything else, while casters going full bore, and paladins going crazy withs SU's and neither mob ever even thought about anyone else.<br />
<br />
Just seems too wrong and easy for me...</div></div><hr />

If you think it's to easy for a warrior to tank it (because of incite) - let a hybrid do. Snare, stun, terror works just like it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fabel</div><div class="date">01-15-2004, 09:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One question, is there any way to train archery? I ask here as I tried it with the grimling chieftain in Hollowshade Moor as I remembered he was permarooted but he is now summoning so I had to kill it. And dead mobs dont help training archery...</div></div><hr />

He is not perma rooted, but will completely ignore you unless you get into melee range. He has insane hp regen, so you can plunk away all day.<br />
<br />
If I am not mistaken, he is involved in the VP key quest and I think he is an Iksar.<br />

Edit: Doh, just remembered where I saw the info:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Besrikarle</div><div class="date">01-15-2004, 11:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">On perma rooted mobs i usually just have a paladin chain stun the shit out of it for like 10 minutes or somewhile while prepping or getting adds under control. Then put the whole raid into position, start off the healers, and push taunt when the heals roll in. Guarantee thats alot more aggro than 5 incites worth hehe. Immense aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Uukla</div><div class="date">01-15-2004, 12:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">nod, before changes, same could be said for slow / malo / cripple over and over, and then popping AE taunt as you rolled in.<br />
Incite doesnt change things that much.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">01-15-2004, 01:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Back in the day my old guild just used a ranger chain snaring while we buffed. That way if something bad happened and we lost a tank, we got 18 seconds (weaponshield) to get the new tank set up and a ranger got splatted! Win/win.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">landrain</div><div class="date">01-15-2004, 02:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">my opinion, though, its still makes what was designed as supposedly challenging, no challenge and zero risk..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">01-15-2004, 06:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">But how is it any different than before incite? If a ranger is chaining snaring for 10 minutes and you taunt until the mob turns to you, you will have WAY better agro than 4 or 5 or even 10 incites. There has never been much risk with perma rooted mobs, the difference is that now they can make the warrior chain cast on the mob rather than having him taunt the mob off someone else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">niin</div><div class="date">01-15-2004, 08:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem is with perma-rooted mobs, not incite.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">01-15-2004, 08:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hahaha Wandor...would I have loved to see that..too bad you didn't use Cabby tho, he's much more fun to watch go Splat! from some pissed off mob</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">01-15-2004, 08:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah perma rooted mobs have always been pretty gimp.  How stupid is it for the boss mob to just sit back waiting around helpless while the raid fully debuffs it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">landrain</div><div class="date">01-16-2004, 10:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">seems that they forgot the summon codes on perma-rooted... making a perma rooted mob summon at 100% health would really change strategy some. That along with making guards insta-respawns. <br />
<br />
I think the difference here though was that while HP/AL in SSRa do KB/stuns, so that they will target others .. Avhi/Ultor just are gimp anyways. And Avhi has one of the coolsest abilities in the game... nothing like that swarm of skelles over running you for the first time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dima</div><div class="date">01-16-2004, 10:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">if you think incite is wrong on perma mobs, its just like shooting an arrow at a mob for an hour, it's still really pissed.<br />
shrug, its a benifit to us really, cause we can get pre aggro. not really an exploit, you're not killing it or anything, just locking aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">01-16-2004, 02:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah Shik, it always seemed funny to me that Cabby would forget his Bio Orb in the bank when we would do IV!!! It always was fun to watch that lizard die.</div></div><hr />
