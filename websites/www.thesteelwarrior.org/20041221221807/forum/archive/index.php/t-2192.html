I have a level 45 warrior and i noticed that my chances to hit decreased around level 38-39. Now I only hit like 30%.<br />
Does anyone know what i can do to increase my chances to hit? It´s very frustating to miss soooooo much.</div></div><hr />

So higher attack would raise the possible dampage per hit lower the chance that the mob will midigate the entire hit.</div></div><hr />

This is false.  A hit can not be mitigated to 0.</div></div><hr />

They increase how much you hit for.  Your accuracy is determined by your level, your weapon skill, your offense skill, and the level of the mob you are fighting.  I guess if you're in time it's also affected by +accuracy mods.  I wouldn't know.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That said, using a faster weapon can give you more hits per unit time which can help agro too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Weapon skill is about the only thing that will increase your hit%, maybe levels as well I'm not sure about that since I didn't parse it when Sscaley was levelling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">07-29-2003, 02:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tactical Mastery doesn't necessarily increase your chance to hit.  It lets you swing through mob defenses occasionally, but you still have the same chance to miss completely or hit.  It will increase how many chances you have to hit when from the front, but doesn't increase your chance.<br />
<br />
As for what you can do.  Level.  You will miss a lot, it's just the way it goes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaluas</div><div class="date">07-29-2003, 07:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for all the answers. I was thinking about getting a haste item. If can i increase my speed that should also increase my % to hit. I was thinking about getting the FBSS. Is it ok or shuld i try to get another haste item? The problem is i really dont know any other except the Silver Chitin Hand Wraps. But as far as i know they have almost the same % of haste. <br />
So my question is if i should get the FBSS or is 22 % not so noticeable?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">07-29-2003, 09:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes at 45th you should have a haste item, perhaps even better than a FBSS.<br />
<br />
No it will not affect your hit rate. It will however increase your DPS.</div></div><hr />

Costs a fair bit more then FBSS but the stats on them and the raw AC compared to the FBSS make up for the extra dough</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Korinn_emarr</div><div class="date">07-29-2003, 10:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess I have been miss informed about the atk vs mob mitigation thing. I must have missed the parses disproving it. <br />
<br />
That kinda sucks to because it means I really do miss that much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tsaotsao</div><div class="date">07-29-2003, 06:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Best advice was already given. Work on your skills and level up.  Max out what you can, look for higher ratio and lower delay weapons.  Don't ignore the proc'ing weapons though. Some have so-so stats, but the proc makes up for it in helping to keep the mobs attention.<br />
<br />
Your job as a warrior is moving into being able to hold the mob's attention. Take the damage so others can deal the damage. <br />
<br />
As I grew, I made sure I had at least one melee skill maxed as soon as I could, then I worked on the others so none would fall behind. It's hard to do on all of them, I did let 2HB lay dormant a bit too long, but I am catching that up now. <br />
<br />
When you hit 52 I think it is, you will have a good chance to catch your skills up that you left behind. <br />
<br />
In my 40's I used a Centi Shortsword and a Shaded Blade and they did me quite well until I got into my 50's. <br />
<br />
For you, now is the time to experiment. Learn what works for what situation and what doesn't. Don't stick to one thing. Adapt, change, try new things and see what works best for you.<br />
<br />
There is no set answer when you are a warrior. What works well for one, doesn't always work well for others. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CedVicious</div><div class="date">07-30-2003, 02:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The haste is noticeable but FBSS has no stats so its a waste of a waist slot.  I believe SCHW has higher haste by 5% or so and it has decent stats.  I recommend getting the SCHW.  <br />
<br />
That aside, haste will not increase your &quot;% to hit&quot; it will only increase the amount of chances you get to hit leading to more hits during a battle, which is probably what you meant.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DrachenfeldTP</div><div class="date">08-03-2003, 08:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, silver chitin handwraps do not have &quot;like 5%&quot; more haste on them over fbss. The differance is 1%.<br />
<br />
As for buying a rbg instead of a fbss, i would not. rbgs on TP are like 20k, and fbss' 2k. The differance in stats is like 8str/dex/sta 25hps, and 6% haste. Now granted 6% more haste is noticable, but for 18k you can get a lot of equipment/weapons that might make you tank better.<br />
<br />
But what do I know, I'm just a rogue ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">08-03-2003, 11:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">People have been buying RBG's over FBSS's since the difference was 50k, the Runebranded Girdle is only more affordable now</div></div><hr />

<br />
     &gt;&gt;This is false. A hit can not be mitigated to 0.<br />
<br />
And it is easy to prove false.  If it were true, then when attacking a mob that has a damage shield you would see yourself missing the mob, but taking damage from the DS.  It doesn't happen.</div></div><hr />

While you can do things that make you swing more often, it doesn't mean you will hit more accurately, just you will hit more since you're swinging more.</div></div><hr />
