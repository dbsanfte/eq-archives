<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gront</div><div class="date">02-06-2004, 07:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've got a GSoT, and I'm expecting to get a GSot4W sometime soon on a BoT tower pickup raid.  Which leaves me with an interesting question.<br />
<br />
The GSoT does significantly less damage (31/30 vs 41/31).  But its proc has a stun component, giving it much better proc aggro than the GSot4W (100dd+stun vs. 75dd).  What I don't know is whether the 25dd+stun difference is more aggro than the 31 vs. 41 damage difference.<br />
<br />
If the stun proc makes the GSoT a superior choice for aggro-holding over the GSot4W, then my choice is easy; Anger III aug on the GSoT, 150dd vs. disease aug on the GSot4W, one to tank, one for DPS.  But if the GSot4W is superior for holding aggro, then I'm not sure what to use for my DPS weapon (I'm not in a raiding guild, so my choices are somewhat limited).<br />
<br />
Advice?  Opinions?  Commentary?<br />

P.S. At the moment, all I'm tanking is LDoN normal, for which CHoS/SotB is more than sufficient.  But we're gearing up for LDoN hard, and at that point, ripostes become a consideration, and I want to switch to 2-handers for tanking purposes.</div></div><hr />

41/31 vs 31/30+Stun ....<br />
<br />
Hard call, i cant reallu tell you the ratio difference is huge.<br />
GSo4W should be more solid agro but slower to build up.<br />
GSoT should agro faster, and be a bit worse on the log run.<br />
<br />
The DPS gap is HUGE however.<br />
<br />
If i were you i'd put anger3 on the GSo4W. It will become a mini BoW.<br />
<br />
You will increase expotentially the &quot;snap agro factor&quot;<br />
And keep the far superior &quot;no proc log run&quot; agro.<br />
And have better stats &amp; dps of course.</div></div><hr />

For LDoN I use the best aggro weapons that I have.  I have been tempted to Anger 3 aug the Go4W but I like having it as an option for raids when I'm not MT because it is by far my best dps weapon.<br />
<br />
I'd say Anger 3 the GoT for LDoN and throw a dps proc on the Go4W for when you don't want agro.</div></div><hr />

I love the DPS and am used to the agro, but I still have to pull out my anger3 auged GBoS and CHoS when I need more agro.<br />
<br />
I was tempted to aug a GSoT to find the answer to the question you asked, but with GoD just days away, I'm waiting and hoping there's a better solution for us there.</div></div><hr />
