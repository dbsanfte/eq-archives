<br />
My guild AEs a lot of mobs in PoP.  Every other melee class has situational dps. (Rogue - from the back, Monk - everywhere melee can be used, Ranger - Archery, Paladin - Undead, SK - where pets can be used, Beastlord - Pets)  <br />
<br />
Would making warriors king of AE melee damage hurt anything?  We'd still be miles away from the damage output of caster classes in this department.  It would really just be fun and some contribution to the many AE environments in PoP.</div></div><hr />

I like the idea, just can't wait for the flames though as I kinda expect them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">05-27-2003, 10:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess it would pretty much come down to the question as to how powerful is Rampage?  It gives warriors the ability to hit every mob in range once every ten minutes, yes?<br />
<br />
If you put this on a smaller timer (10 seconds sounds too short...shall we say more like 30?  Whatever timer you want under 10 minutes), on single mobs this would give warriors an extra attack every time it pops up (not too shabby), but it would be dangerous on multiple mobs unless none are mezzed.<br />
<br />
Although I'd love them to add a chance to stun to the &quot;AE Melee&quot;, I don't believe they'd add that. ^_^<br />
<br />
With the current re-use time in place, it does sound like this ability can only be used in very narrow circumstances, or perhaps a AE group.  (Bear in mind that SOE has done several things to make people unable to AE in various zones).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wilhelmm_Lanys</div><div class="date">05-27-2003, 11:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think this is a bad idea. not that this would be over-powered or anything; it's not very useful usually. But, devs will read this and change Rampage timer to 1 minute insted of 10 and say they have fixed warriors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ultimus</div><div class="date">05-28-2003, 04:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree rampage needs an upgrade. However, a 10 second refresh would be unbalanced. A person would *always* gain an extra attack with a 2h every 10 seconds. A person could use it versus single mobs like an automatic double attack.<br />
<br />
Perhaps rampage should be revamped entirely. In my opinion, the skill should become a proc like flurry when more then one mob is present in your range of area effect. Furthermore, Sony could code it to *not* hit mezzed mobs. Thus, this change would ensure more rampages in a 10 minute time frame and avoid abuse of using it versus single mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FennyMT</div><div class="date">05-28-2003, 05:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the way you use rampage is this:<br />
<br />
1. get an earthshaker.<br />
2. when more than one mob arrives at camp, you swap it in and rampage before a mez hits.<br />
<br />
any other usage is improper :p   <br />
<br />
now, seeing the correct use of the ability, we see that 10 seconds overpowers us like a pre-nerf enchanter.  which, in sony's eyes, should be acceptable ... at least long enough for us to get a few hundred aa's ;)<br />
<br />
the way to improve rampage is to provide weapons with either<br />
<br />
a) more damaging pbae's  (supernova.. haha)<br />
b) more interesting pbae's (stun.. effect: word of morell .. lol)<br />
c) weapons with extremely high proc rate pbae's but unusably high delay.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wait, that would still be a tad too powerful...<br />
<br />
<br />
Put it on the same timer as melee/ranged attack?<br />
<br />
<br />
That might do it...</div></div><hr />

Im a newb when it comes to Rampage. I have never seen it used, and don't personally know anyone that has it. So its a 10 minute refresh, and it lets you hit every mob in a radius. Is it just one hit on all the mobs in a radius? Or do you continue hitting all the mobs in a radius for a small duration? I can't see the worth if its just one hit every 10 minutes.   Also, is there a message that everyone see's when you rampage? Thanks for un-newbifying me. <br />

<br />
Useless you say eh!<br />
<br />
Earthshaker procs AE hit for 250.  So if you manage to hit 40 mobs and proc 3 times in those 40 hits, you have the potential to do 250 damage by 40 by 3 (30K dmg).  <br />
<br />
The amount of places it can be used are very very limited, but<br />

Why not 1-2 minutes as a compromise, and still allow the aa upgrades to improve it (down to a final timer of about 54 - 108 seconds)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ragnok</div><div class="date">05-28-2003, 01:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So this is all about fun factor. Not worth my time. They would need to greatly reduce the refresh time for me to consider it. Too many beneficial aa's I still need to get.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is a way that a warrior can effectively contribute some serious damage output to an AE situation.<br />
<br />
Had my AE seb group (see link above) had a 10 second timer instead of a ten minute one, I could have done as much as 60 times more damage.... (this group did about 10 runs or so).<br />
<br />
473,000 x 60 = 28 million hps of damage which is not realistic because we had down time between runs, but I'm quite confident I would have hit 6-7 million easy.  <br />
<br />
How balanced would that be?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ainmer</div><div class="date">05-28-2003, 01:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Earthshaker plus rampage is pretty laughable, Yroc.  I do more damage rampaging with a Blade of War or Plankton Sword than I do with Earthshaker.<br />
<br />
I think the right way to handle activation is something similar to Monk Thunderous Kick Discipline, i.e. once activated the next attack is a Rampage.  This solves the &quot;free attack&quot; issue.<br />
<br />
Lots say 10 seconds sounds too fast, but...  Do you guys realize how little damage that is?<br />
<br />
Here's the way to show you:  Equip your favorite weapons of choice.  Now turn your attack on and off every 10 seconds.  Parse your mad dps and you will find it is much, much less than you do to a single mob.  In fact, it basically sets your delay at 100 for any weapon that uses it.  <br />
<br />
Let's say you use a Blade of War.  My average dps with bard and Blade of War is 170 or so.  My adjusted delay with Blade of War is around 18.  Now imagine my Blade of War dps with 100 delay, 5 times slower.  This would give me about 34 dps per mob using rampage.  <br />
<br />
PB AE damage comparison not taking crits into effect:<br />
Cleric/Druid:  25 dps per mob<br />
Magician:  63 dps per mob<br />
Wizard: 75 per mob<br />
Necro:  11 per mob!  Whoohoo!<br />
Bard:  16-20 per mob<br />
<br />
Targetted AE damage comparison not taking crits into effect:<br />
Druid:  118 dps per mob<br />
Enchanter:  18 per mob!<br />
Magician:  50 per mob<br />
Shaman: 36 per mob<br />
Wizard:  68 per mob<br />
<br />
As usual, on PB AE wizard would still do 2x our dps, similar to regular single target dps.  Magicians would also greatly outdamage us.<br />
<br />
Put it to a 30 second delay and we're doing 10 dps per mob.<br />
<br />
Now before people start talking about how &quot;my job is to tank, damage means NOTHING!!!111!!&quot;, try to get outside the box for a moment.  Being completely one dimensional is the huge downside of our class.  Adding situational dps doesn't hurt the class.  My guild AEs mobs a ton (lots to AE in Earth, Fire, tier 1-3, and of course Coirnav in Water), and giving the warriors something fun to do while we do it is not a bad thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ragnok</div><div class="date">05-28-2003, 01:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The numbers look nice and shiny when you talk about 40 mobs. Seriously though, if you pull 40 mobs (how? why?), and you do a rampage before everyone wipes, what is it youve really accomplished? It was fun.  There are so many beneficial aa's that would help me play my role better. Perhaps when I've spent another 100 aa's on the important stuff I'll come back and pick this up for fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yroc Morf</div><div class="date">05-28-2003, 02:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ainmer.. its not fair to compare you to me.  I'm not guilded and your in the best guild on our server.  You have uber weapons, I use epics.<br />
<br />
The problem is the AA is available to both of us.  The damage output I reference might be laughable to you ... but if I could get 60 times more than the laughable amount I get today, would I not become the god of Seb AE grps?<br />
<br />
Your thoughts</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ainmer</div><div class="date">05-28-2003, 02:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you procced once per rampage you would do a mindbending 30 dps per mob or so.  In my experiences with Earthshaker and AE, often on a rampage I would usually proc once or not at all.<br />
<br />
Balancing an entire class around a single weapon from the first expansion is not a good idea.  Rend Robes don't drop any more, ever wonder why?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yroc Morf</div><div class="date">05-28-2003, 02:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Your original post asked about possible inbalance.  The earthshaker is one thing that might cause a problem (a response to your question)<br />
<br />
I am of the impression the proc check is per hit, not per rampage.  These people seem to agree with that.   (http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthebunker.showMessage?topicID=5448.topic)   Do you have information that suggests this is not the case?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Remf da Troll</div><div class="date">05-28-2003, 05:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hola-<br />
<br />
Warrior + earthshaker + rampage + AE pull = most damage you can do in the game in one &quot;attack round&quot; currently.  On a 60+ mob pull, while slowed + max dex, I regularly got 8-10 procs, in one case 13 for ONE rampage.  I'll do the math for ya:<br />
<br />
65 mobs x 13procs x 246dd = 207,870 dmg.  add in melee damage, assuming a 10pct double/5% triple attack hitting an average of 60% of the time doing 75dmg (all fairly conservative numbers) ~= another 3k of damage.  Works out to around 3k+ of damage per mob, once per 10 minutes.  I think the best dmg I parsed was about 220k in one rampage, enough to KS most of the mobs from the AE group I was pulling for.  Good thing they were guild mates. ;)  The spam was epic.<br />
<br />
Would be nice if it refreshed more often, but it'd prolly be unbalanced if it did.  When it was first put in, you could &quot;refresh&quot; rampage by using an instant click buff apparently (like casters did nuke/jbooting), so people would rampage nonstop with it.  Was SERIOUSLY broken obviously.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">05-28-2003, 05:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ainmer, I don't discount your experiences with the blade of war, but seriously, i'm gonna have to say you either haven't used an earthshaker much or haven't been lucky with it.  Earthshaker owns every non proccing weapon when you can scrape together enough mobs to make hitting that rampage button worth it.   I've leveled a pull in droga before with one rampage, with most of the damage coming from procs.  How many HP does a level 30 mob have divided by 246?  That's a lot of procs. 6 or7 procs isn't uncommon on a 30+ mob pull due to the it's low delay.  Blade of war melee damage isn't gonna touch the average damage an earthshaker could put out.  I understand that you don't proc all the time, but 1 proc is already more than the average hit a BoW does.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ainmer</div><div class="date">05-28-2003, 05:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I suppose it would make some sense to frame my comments about Earthshaker vs. Blade of War in regards to rampage.<br />
<br />
I am not talking about pulling 50+ mobs in some Seb AE group or farming faction in Droga.  I am talking about 10-12 pulls in places like Vex Thal, Earth, Water, Fire, and Air.  In these cases the likelihood of you doing more dps with an Earthshaker than a Blade of War is miniscule.<br />
<br />
Regardless, balancing a class against a single item that drops in the Hole is ridiculous.<br />
<br />
For that matter, who the hell cares that you can kill some level 30 mobs faster?  Or can in Seb AE?  Does it matter in any way?</div></div><hr />

Dead wrong.<br />
<br />
1.  I posted numbers above to show who the undisputed masters of AE are.  Hint, they aren't warriors.<br />
2.  Where do you AE these days?  I haven't seen an AE group since Luclin.  Near as I can tell regular grouping is much more profitable.  You aren't gonna AE successfully in any PoP zone.  Sure, gratz on Seb AE group, but once again, who gives a fuck?</div></div><hr />

if we were naive and assumed no resists, we would need 32,000 / 246 = 130 procs.<br />
<br />
for now, let's assume there exists a number of mobs &quot;N&quot; sufficient enough for 6 warriors to generate 130 procs, or each warrior to proc at least 21 times.<br />
<br />
now, if N is not larger than the entire population of the zone, it should be possible for a group of only warriors to drop gorenair, talendor, or any mob in a zone with enough rampage fodder to generate the procs to kill it :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Back when they added AE rampage, it was bugged and you could &quot;instantly&quot; refresh it w/ a click buff, for an effective delay of say 1 second or so.  Was MASSIVELY broken, warriors could run up to shroom patches in FG and kill them in 20 seconds or so.  <br />
<br />
Add in PoP levels and AAs, plus the (hopefully) upcoming exp changes, and multiply that time by 10x (for a 10 sec delay) and it'd STILL be massively overpowered.  Soloing a 6 mob shroom patch in 2 minutes just isn't reasonable.<br />
<br />
This isn't even considering pure melee damage options; since rampage is &quot;instant&quot; (weapon delay independent), high weapon delay becomes GOOD- something like a weighted axe (at 150 dly) has a 100pt or so dmg bonus with a 50 base damage; for *just* rampage it's about the best pure melee weapon there is, tho the UP hammer is quite good too.<br />
<br />
For smaller pulls, something that procs a rain spell might be best; if your PR is up to snuff, it'd be hard to beat a poison wind censor, for instance.  Appears to have a fairly high proc rate and the rain does nice damage over several ticks.<br />
<br />
Anyway, enough musing and back to the point... dropping rampage's reuse time significantly would require fundamental changes to the AA to keep it balanced, such as preventing weapon procs or crits with it, or limiting the number of targets.  Both of which I would not like to see.  I say keep it as-is.<br />

Keep Rampage on a 10 minute timer.<br />
<br />
When you &quot;rampage', you enter a new mode ala defensive, etc.<br />
For a period of time (1 minute, 2 minutes, whatever), every blow has a chance to 'proc' a rampage, with a maximum of 4 targets getting hit (as per mage rain spells).<br />
<br />
Introduce AA skills that decrease re-use timer, increase 'proc' timer, and maybe even increase number of mobs targetted.<br />
<br />
The skill suddenly has a situational use... It's not overpowered, and it has an incentive to spend AA on the skill.</div></div><hr />

It would add some much needed and missing depth to a class that lacks .... multi-dimension.<br />
<br />
However I don't think there is a need to change the existing rampage to allow that.  <br />
<br />
Adding a new rampage AA would be a better option (maybe a 63 or 65 AA upgrade to the existing ramapge).  This way AEers such as Ainmer can have fun in PoFire (I assume your bored in your AE groups Ainmer) without taking away my fun in Seb AE groups.<br />
<br />
Slimes ideas seems sound ... if implemented without causing a nerf to the rampage abilities we already have, that is.  <br />
<br />
I understand many think the existing rampage is a toy... and in many ways it is.  It however allows a warrior to participate in large pull AE situations.  If wars are to participate in small pull AE situations, something designed for that purpose would be better (giving warriors the ability to contribute in both places).<br />
<br />
Hence more depth in our ability to contribute situational DPS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As I understood it they pushed a button and slay undead came on and they were capable of doing massive damage at a cost of taking coniderable more damage and they could turn it off at will,Maybe it had a timer till reactivation I don't fully remember.<br />
<br />
So basically they throw Rampage on a push button,You find yourself in an AE group so you click your Rampage button and so long as that button is depressed you have a chance of Procing Rampage,Just like a mob would.When you leave the group you turn it off.Simple as that.<br />
<br />
Obviously they can adjust the proc rate so that it is not overpowered if you want to argue that it is,and all is well.</div></div><hr />
