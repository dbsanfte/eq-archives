<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>chaddu1256</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Here is my magelo I was just curious as to what to upgrade next.  I have about 20k to spend, and im a lvl 44 war btw.<br />
<br />

<br />
Any help would be great! Thanx</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Your gear isnt bad, and at 44 you're getting close to the point where you can start using items with recommended levels or restricted level so it might be worth pushing on to 46 before you spend that plat.<br />
<br />
Easiest and bested upgrade will be rings.  At 44 grabbing 2 Velium fire wedding rings would be the way to go, but if you hold out till 46 you could get a couple of valorium rings of gallantry instead.  Not sure what these go for these days but probably in the area of 4-5k each.<br />
<br />
Next I would start buying up pieces of dwarven cultural plate.  These you can equip now and will get the full benefit of stats at 46.  Bracers at 25AC +6svall +30hps are particularly good value, Legs at 40AC 40hps are almost as good as SS.  Boots are pretty good value too.<br />
<br />
Earring - get rid of that forest loop and get something with HPs.  An orc fang would be a cheap improvement at about 15pp, an electrum black sapphire one with 2 AC and 35HPs would be better, or any of the selection of &gt; +50hp earrings that you can get in the bazaar now.  Your call on how much you want to spend really.<br />
<br />
Some other slots to upgrade on the cheap - <br />
Neck - try for an amulet of ancient mummy wrappings (45hps) these should be going cheap considering the rate at which they drop<br />
<br />
Face - Crystal Spider Eyes are a cheap starting point at 8AC 35HPs.  Depending on whats going cheap there are a few other options to look out for too tho, Death Mask of the Elysians, Face mask of Frozen Mana, Grobb hide mask. etc etc<br />
<br />
Head - Keep an eye out for a helmet of the raldukan.  You used to be able to pick these up ridiculously cheap for their stats (cos they are pink - you have Dyes right?). 24AC 35HPs is a decent helm that will last you a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>chaddu1256</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanx alot for the info friend.  I have one more question real quick.  If you look on my magelo again, I just looted a bloodguard soul ring in Mistmoore.  With its 5ac 15str 15agi and 16% haste, should I keep that ring for the stats since I already have the sash of dragonborn, or try and sell this ring and get some other equipment?  Any suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Khazzuz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I would sell the bloodguard ring and use it to fund other upgrades.  Eoden is correct, the 6/65 rings or valorium rings are much better suited for a warrior.  Besides the fact that you're getting no use out of the haste effect, the two stats on the ring are nowhere near as important to your tanking duties as a few purchasable upgrades with hp, AC, or stamina would be.  I think Eoden has provided very good advice.  Perhaps look into a Dented Kunzar Warhelm as an alternative to the Raldukan.  On Povar they seem to be much more common and the price is better.  Think its 23ac 8sta 35hp if I remember correctly.</div></div><hr />

How about sell the belt and the ring get a silver chitin hand wrap, the reason for that is schw has higher haste % than both of your items and it is cheap like around 3k.  the ring is not bad should sell for aorund 8k, you can use that to get better armor, i think that is an area you need to work on.  The weapons are fine for your level.  Although i do notice CHOS price has been going down on my server only 13-16k now.<br />
