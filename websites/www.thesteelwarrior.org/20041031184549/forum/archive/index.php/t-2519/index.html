Now, my guild is starting to kill mobs that drop no drop haste items, other then the ToV bracer (which I think would be at the top of my list) any other sugestions for a new haste item so I can ditch the 50hp helm and get somethign a bit better?<br />
<br />
PoI neck looks good, the earrings seem to be a waste because of the other options out there.  I havent' seen any cloaks or belts that are atainable that drop and wouldn't be a big HP/AC loss.  Anyone have any ideas?<br />
<br />
Doze is hard to find up so I am not holding out for the bracelet, but we have been raiding Vindi, Tmax, PoI dragon type stuff... basically if I have it on me then we can raid it with the exception of my current haste item wich I finally bought because an rbb was costing me way too many hps.</div></div><hr />

Belt from Grieg</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Loosscru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">this belt? (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=8951) <br />
<br />
Because I am allready useing the cowl of morality, the griegs belt wouldn't be much better if at all.  I would loose ac and raw hp and the extra sta wouldn't do much as I allready raid buff to max, or close enough to where the 15 extra sta on the belt would only yeild me about 20 hp more max.  While 20 hp is worth an upgrade it is just a sta upgrade and I am sure I can find a few sta points elsewhere and send that belt on over to the SKs or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Crayno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sorry,can't see Magelo at work so I didn't know what haste item you had.<br />
Gaunts of dragon slaying would come to mind if you can get a KT or AOW helm.(contradictionary I know)<br />
You can browse all haste items in the library but not much better out there pre POP/VT than bracelet of speed afaik,maybe you can mq some parts of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sangiovese</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Belt of the Destroyer from Dagarn in NToV would be similar stats to your current belt +41% haste.  So it would free up your helm slot.  If you guys can kill Xanamech, you should be able to raid in NToV even though I didn't see it on your list of places you raid.<br />
<br />
Yelinak talisman is a nice neck haste option, as is the shim from Xanamech that you already mentioned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Loosscru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Not raiding NToV yet... Some of the casters still want there HoT gear.  Others are just waiting for another tear to drop so they can get thier quest items.  So basically no one wants to ruin faction in NToV quite yet.  Maybe in after about half the guild has sleeper keys the rest will want the keys more then the quest items.   And we can always switch back.  Do an NToV raid or two then go back to the Giant beat down.<br />
<br />
But in answer to your questoin, no we don't raid NToV.  Unfortunatly the Yelinak talisman would probably be used more for the key then for the item.  Just seeing sleepers is a big goal for ths guild and one we want to accomplish.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well if the talisman would be used for a key, then you've always got Yeli's head too to get the gauntlets.  You'd spend a lot of time on faction if you're pro dragon, but I hear it's worth it for those.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tierleaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Belt from Dagarn is fairly rare drop with lots of competition for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Maugua Iceblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">After reading this, i have a question? I recenly came into the posession of a CoF. should i keep it and save for a belt than would take forever, or would it be smarter to sell CoF and look for a diff haste item?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">With the availability of the Kizrak's Helm and the Heavy Rubicite Girdle, the Cloak of Flames is back to the best tradable haste.  Keep it, you're not gonna buy better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Talun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">the CoF is hard to beat for haste till you can REALLY upgrade some other slot with a haste item.Lots of 41% haste items with good stats drop once you get to VT and above.</div></div><hr />
