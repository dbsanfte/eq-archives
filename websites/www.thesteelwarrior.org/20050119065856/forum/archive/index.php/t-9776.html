I have decent items but not being flagged keeps my options down.  Can you guys take a look at my magelo and tell me where I can improve.  I'm in a relatively small guild that raids but nothing big atm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mithlani</div><div class="date">11-17-2004, 03:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You have a very solid base to work with.  You need to work on your aa's first off.  That will greatly improve your tanking abilities.<br />
<br />
As for your gear... get a new pair of shoulders.  Wall of Slaughter trash drops a nice pair of shoulders.  <br />
<br />
Take your guild to BoT and kill Einride for the GBoS... and lose the aggro reducing mace.<br />
<br />
One last bit of advice... hit the LDoN's like a madman.  Not only will this help gank aa's but you can upgrade your gear and be a solid tank in no time.  N Ro camp is the key.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">11-17-2004, 03:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">primary : BoS : felicitation for having your epic but now you need a better weapon<br />
secondary : this one is worse that your primary so it need to be changed ASAP<br />
 =&gt; there is now good aggro weapon in bazard /MoM, ... ; and don't forget the most important thing : augment your weapons (A3 or FoY).<br />
shoulder : start your hole quest for Strength of the Elements or, if you have the money, get a Horn Spiked Shoulder Plates.<br />
rest is OK for now. when you will hace decent DW aggro combo your group/raid will be able to handle stronger boss (lower PoP I gess) for GBoS, OSoW, Horn Spiked Shoulder Plates (if you didn't bougth it), ...<br />
<br />
conclusion : get better aggro weapons and the rest will follow...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frostpaw</div><div class="date">11-17-2004, 03:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Once you hit 65, I think the best thing you can do is focus on grinding AA's in camps that can help you with the new Omens armor quests.  First off, you need the AA's. Second, might as well start collecting the parts you need for the quest. Third, some of the camps will also be giving you the required Loyalist faction. Finally, some of these camps will aslo drop decent sellables and attunable upgrades for ya. Also, once you are doing the WoS and Ruined City (and Eventually MPG) camps some decent drops from trash mobs for you.<br />
<br />
Another area you could improve is your weaps. Some of these would make nice weap upgrades for ya: Either Droga weap, Mace of Memories, GBoS, CHSD, SoMWV, Bygone Butcher's Cleaver.  Also, some LDoN's for agro augs would be good idea.<br />
<br />
Edit1: There is not a single piece of LDoN armor that i would buy at this point. Agro augs first. AC augs next. HP augs third. All of the Armsmasters stuff is better than Royal Attendant.  (If you don't anticipate getting Armsmasters BP or Legs I could see you buying RA if you just have too many LDoN pts layin around, hehe)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kiya</div><div class="date">11-18-2004, 08:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Biggest concern I see is your aggro from weapons.  I'd pick up a Droga pair or a GSoT to start with.  Yes, it may seem like they cookie cutter weapons.  But they are cookie cutter for a reason: They get aggro!  If a weapon looked like a baby's rattle, yet held aggro well, I'd use it, LOL!<br />
<br />
The next weakest slot looks to be your shoulders.  The above suggestions work, or sneak into PoMischief and camp a Grand Pauldron of Study.  After you do that, I'd grind out some Everfrost (anger) or Guk (yak) LDoNs for aggro augs and then head to butcherblock LDoN and pick up some AC augs.</div></div><hr />

Get a droga combo. once you hit 65, you might consider breaking from reg xp to finish ND3, PE, and Sturdi5. that'll put you past 6k hits unbuffed (probably). your AC is looking good for your level, at 70 it'll probably be 1400+ considering defensive skill ups. until you can afford a BoC or your guild is farming xana or bot towers for a gbos, id stick with the droga combo. if you can scrounge up 20k, get a Mace of Memories. sweet stats and a nice ykesha proc for offhand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dethkitty</div><div class="date">11-19-2004, 05:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the help.  I've dropped my offhand and picked up the Mace 50k on my server and upgraded my shoulders.  Haven't updated my magelo as of yet but hit 5400hp unbuffed and 1327ac.  Hopefully I can grind out the last 50% to 65 and start on my AA's.</div></div><hr />
