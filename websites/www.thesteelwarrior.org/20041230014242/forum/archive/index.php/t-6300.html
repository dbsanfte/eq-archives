<br />
I am currently Lvl 65 and have 32 or so AA's and am going the HP/DEF route on them. <br />
<br />
My question is, how can I increase my pitiful AC to about 1450 unbuffed? I am in a decent guild that is getting stronger but by no means uber and looking at some of these market prices makes me want to cry. <br />
<br />
Please take a look at my magelo and let me know what you think. Any help/advice would be greatly appreciated.<br />

<br />
I am in a decent guild that is getting stronger but by no means uber <br />
<br />
Can you be more specific? .. what mobs do you raid? <br />
<br />
VT?<br />
Pre-Elemental PoP?<br />
Elemental Planes pre-time?<br />
<br />
how can I increase my pitiful AC to about 1450 unbuffed <br />
<br />
The only realistic way to get this figure unbuffed is with VT armor drops or Elemental Planes armor drops. If your guild raids either one then secure a few pieces under whichever loot system your guild uses. <br />
<br />
<br />
If your guild isn't yet raiding endgame Luclin or the elemental planes you really don't need 1450 AC unbuffed anyway.<br />
<br />
<br />
You can always get a shield  :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
I strongly disagree.   I unbuff 1532 ac (60 ac from tribute)<br />
<br />
Buy or loot two (there Lore but whatever) Jeweld Architecture BP's from Tak or bazaar.  Or two Tactician's Bulwark's.  Go to your tribute person and get 50,000k tribute points and 60ac for 1300 10 minute periods or more math than I can phanthom<br />
<br />
Fae</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">03-23-2004, 04:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Your gear is pretty solid for a non-raid warrior.  Short of expensive stuff like a helmet of rallos zek or steel rings of earthen resilience, your best bet would be to get your guild keyed up for VT.  Don't know if  you're close to that point, but you've obviously been doing BoT towers so I don't think it's out of your reach.  Of course the number of guilds in VT on your server probably effects how likely that is.  Otherwise start killin in Ssra and doing the Avatar of War.  AoW in particular could help out your AC a bunch, and get you an EB weapon while you're at it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wompem Ondahed</div><div class="date">03-23-2004, 04:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">LDoN AC Augments! Check my Magelo. Aug'd the neck, face, and back which is 3x 10 ac upgrades, translating into about 45 ac. <br />
<br />
Also look into Loyalist's Shield of Honor, and AC aug it too. The quest is not nearly as hard as you may think. My boots come from LDoN High Risk. Your Kizraks are basically equivalent to most of my LDoN items, so weigh your options on the upgrades of course. <br />
<br />
Btw, my guild is not AoW level yet, the BoC and HoRZ are on loan from a very good friend. We are on Vindi/Xanamech/BoT Towers level of raiding. Our latest 'achievement' was getting Behemoth to 5% before wipe ( first try ). He will die soon enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rolemas</div><div class="date">03-23-2004, 05:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I appreciate all the info everyone.<br />
<br />
My guild is currently in the same boat as Wompen's. Vindi, BoT towers and such. <br />
<br />
I thought my AC was decent enough until I was thrust into the MT position not long ago. Yes, I am currently my guild's MT. Sad I know. I also know that  DEF AA's will also help and am working as fast as I can on those.<br />
<br />
I will look into hunting SSra and also will look into the tribute system. I can always just use the system while raiding.<br />
<br />
Thanks again<br />

<br />
Not really, I'm 1800ac unbuffed without VT / Ele.<br />
<br />
Loyalist Shield of Honor (50ac) is pretty easy, and very nice.<br />
<br />
Dozekar quests are easy and pretty nice (silver bracelet of speed - 38ac, silver charm of tranquility - 35ac).  Doze hits like 400s, slowable, though very resistant, ae with 1 slot dispell.  Really a pushover these days.  The quests do take time, but are worth it imo.<br />
<br />
LDoN ac augs are great, and can total 50 raw ac.<br />
<br />
XtCreator in Ssra is also weak, and you can get Shiny Trinket of Speed (25ac range) and Adamantite Wristguard (29 ac).<br />
<br />
Guardian of the Seal drops a 15 ac earring.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">03-25-2004, 05:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">By it taking a month to find Valdanov up I assume you mean it took that long to find the mob that triggers him up.  He spawns as soon as you kill Heratius Grolden.  When I did I read about some people who claimed killing the named in the Coterie castle or killing all the mobs in the castle would help spawn him and others who claimed that had nothing to do with it.  Well, I decided to try it, so I took my warrior and cleric up to the balcony and started killing.  I killed the 4 or 5 named in the castle and any other mob I needed to kill to get to the named.  Within 2 hours or so Heratius spawned, so i called in a few friends, passed out a few bane weapons, and we spawned and killed Valdanov.  <br />
<br />
Maybe I just got lucky, but it shouldn't take a month.  This quest is very easy for a great reward.</div></div><hr />

Like a few others, check my magelo.  You'll see a 60ac 75hp backslot.  Yes, it's just *THAT* worth it, believe me.<br />
<br />

<br />
Actually, he quads for 865 max on a warrior.  He is, like you said, fully slowable however, albeit mighty resistant.  It's generally a good idea to bring a tash stick along if you don't have an enchanter present.  Don't be suprised if it takes you 10-15 tries to slow him.  Once slowed he's a COMPLETE gimp though.<br />
<br />
Are his quests worth it?  Shit yeah they are.  I have the Silver Bracelet of Speed (38ac 10sta 100hp 41% Haste +5 all svs) and the Silver Charm of Tranquility (35ac 15sta 100hp +8 all svs) which I slapped a 10ac aug on and made a 45ac 100hp neck slot.  I can definitely say it took a long, long while to acquire, but VERY VERY worth the time invested.  I will wear these items into Time.</div></div><hr />

You can slow him with just a shm or ench, you must be in melee range to do it.  Trust me ive 3 boxed him about 20 times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Uukla</div><div class="date">03-26-2004, 12:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">LDoN, Dozekar, PoN shade and the loyalist shield are your friends.<br />
All the people who complain about LDoN AA exp forget that at a certain point, AA points reach diminishing returns.  If you get your next 100 AAs in BoT, that will take what, 120 - 150 hours?<br />
If you do the next 150 hours doing 150 LDoNs, thats about 75 AA points (finishing out most defensive AAs, cept sturdiness) and gets you 7500 ldon points, which is enough for 50 AC from the 10 AC augments, plus whatever armor you buy.<br />
<br />
I am at 150 AA and 11000 LDoN points, and I would rack myself up against any warrior in my stage of the game (pre elemental, Tier3 pop)</div></div><hr />

<br />
The shaman who I play with is always right up next to Doze when he's slowing.  Probably the worst time I've ever had fighting Doze is when he resisted slow after slow so many times that my Defensive disc ran out.  I was 2m on my cleric from chaining CHs with barely a smidgeon knocked off Dozekar's health.  Finally, and luckily I might add, he was slowed.  <br />
<br />
Now that I have a Journeyman's Walking Stick, it's a bit smoother ride.  He's more consistantly slowed now, but hopefully my friends and I can finish those quests soon.  Dozekar is a pretty boring fight, hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lessiter1</div><div class="date">03-29-2004, 09:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree completely with the person that mentioned the 10ac augs.  For example, I just put one on my veil, and it went from an item that was somewhat disposable to one that will be really hard to replace before we hit time.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">03-29-2004, 11:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">problem with the doze quests is you have to find him up and you have to find the other HoT named up.  They're all gimp as hell so people just 1 group gank them because the quest result is so good.  So unless you're online a huge amount, good luck finding the mobs up that you need.  <br />
<br />
You encounter the same problem there as anywhere where a reward is way too good for the current quest difficulty.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And yes, Dozer is a gimp.  Any 60+ warrior in Fierce Heraldic or better can single-group him with a good cleric, Enchanter, and support DPS.</div></div><hr />
