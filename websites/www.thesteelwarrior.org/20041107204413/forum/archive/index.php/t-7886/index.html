I'm AFK traveling (and moving to Seattle) for the next week, and I most likely won't have enough net access to summarize while I'm gone.  I'll catch you all up next weekend.

Brael's most recent parses seem to show an 8% reduction in damage from having a 105-AC shield equipped, vs. having 105 AC of non-shield AC equipped.  It appears that shield AC functions as 258% of the listed AC (i.e. offers 158% more AC than the apparent AC).<br />
It is unclear whether this is relative to raw AC or displayed AC.<br />

Wolveren explains bad rampage: &quot;On rooted rampagers you best memblur him, make sure he is clear of agro (assist him to see if he has anyone on target or use HoTT). Then have the intended RT shoot an arrow at him and go from there. <br />
Rampage on rooted mobs is usually messed up because of pullers getting on agro list while clearing the room then being healed by clerics, getting in bards songs, etc. And always, always make sure bards have songs off while setting rampage /nod.&quot;<br />
There is some debate about whether &quot;AE Rampage&quot; really is AE, or whether it's simply a mob that hits a large number of targets from its rampage list.<br />
Pulling trash with Pally/SK using Divine Aura enables you to not heal your pullers, which keeps your healers off the rampage list.<br />
To set rampage, it may help to shoot an arrow or otherwise do damage before taunting.<br />

Max weapons skills when you are higher level and advancement is slower.  Remember that your aggro is based on swings, not hits, so you hold aggro just as well with a zero-skill weapon.<br />

You can't crit on the DD portion of procs that are actually debuffs with a DD component.  But you can crit the 100 DD portion of Anger, since it doesn't leave a debuff icon.<br />

Mobs that use Rapture can mez you no matter what (it's apparently unresistable by PCs of any level).<br />

Mokor wants us to be able to raise one melee stat to 355, like casters can raise one caster stat.  Fitemore wants AGI to matter, and piercing to be as good as other weapons skills, and specializations for warriors.  <br />

You can only crit the DD portion of procs.<br />

/shield &lt;PC name&gt;, or target the PC with /assist and just use &quot;/shield&quot;.<br />
Also, the person you shield takes half damage, and you take 3/4 damage, 125% damage total.<br />

Nimic says: &quot;Coming from someone who did natural durability 3 as his first archtype AA, I would strongly reccomend defensive AA before HP AA. Arbitrary numbers here, but if ND3 provides you with 400 extra HP at 65 thats one (or less) max hits off most mobs you will be tanking. Whereas CA3 potentially allows you to avoid 400 or more damage in between heals. If you avoid one max hit in between heals, on a mob suitable for your level, then you're likely going to exceed the benefit of ND3.&quot;<br />
Aspit says: &quot;It means roughly that after tanking time mobs 50000 times take for example innoruk who is a fairly long fight in respect to the rest of time. Every ac figure that i have tested recently gives me about 2.8 hps worth of mitigation. Assume cheals hit every 2 seconds and the mob deals 1200 dps. In 2 seconds the mob does about 2400 damage on average. Each ac i do cuts dps by 1.4 or 2.8 hps per cheal cycle. These are only rough numbers, on some parses i get 2-3 reduction in dps per ac.&quot;<br />

I have corrected what we concluded at the end of this threat, actually it appears that shields counts for twice as much exactly when we are above the softcap (or if we prefer, when we are above the softcap all the AC from gear, except shield, count for only their half, even if the AC listed in our skill menu is unchanged).<br />
