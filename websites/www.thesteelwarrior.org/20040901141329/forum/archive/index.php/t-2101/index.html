<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, since almost everyone loves Scars of Velious, I was thinking to myself, &quot;Hey, why don't we just do Velious all over again?&quot;.<br />
<br />
EverQuest: Rise of the Storm Guard<br />
<br />
<br />
On the verge of decline after being broken by several defeats, Kael experiences a violent, but reletively bloodless, shift in power.  After a successful assassination attempt upon King Tormax, the Generals move in and take their reign.  Derakor is hanged and the new Priests of Rallos Zek begin focusing their energies to rebuild the once defeated Avatar of War.  City workers and citizens begin rebuilding the layouts of city in preparation for the new order.<br />
<br />
Eyeing the recent advances of the human race, the new war council agrees to liscense the outcast Velkator into building them new steeds of war.  After a successful and brutal raid into the Western Wastes, Velkator would be supplied with the eggs of the giants very own enemies - the dragons themselves.  Using these eggs, Velkator would manifest and twist the newborns for their new purpose.  The Kael Storm Guard is born.<br />
<br />
Scouts of the Coldain began reporting giants riding on the backs terrifying creatures.  These new creatures were fast and tremendously strong.  Dain Frostreaver grew worried, but nevertheless agreed to dispatch a small task force to analyze the situation more closely.  This decision would not only prove useful in the information that was provided, but it would also prove to be one of the most disasterous defeats the Coldain had ever experienced.  The dwarves were slaughtered on open ground by these dragon riders as they tore through the lines and ranks of the Coldain.  Some dwarves improvised and attempted to blockade the charging nightmares with giant spears, but their brutish strength and heavy armor often allowed them to tear right through the lines with impunity.  <br />
<br />
The dragons, meanwhile, go weary of the Giant's military and technilogical advances.  While the dragons still clutched their hold on the reigns of the sky, these new beasts of war the giants often rode allowed them to equally challenge almost any dragon on the ground.  Even the most fiercesome of wyvern warriors found themselves barrelled right over by a terrifying charge of a Storm Rider.  <br />
<br />
Realizing that no single dragon or dwarvish army could ever match the new Kael Empire, the Claws of Veeshan and Coldain drop any differences they once had and band together, or else suffer an impending demise. <br />
<br />
******************************************<br />
<br />
With the story being said, new features we would see is exactly what everyone loved in the old Velious - Rewarding but difficult quests, multiple high end playgrounds to romp through, an interesting storyline, and difficult but non BS high end encounters.  Kael will appear completely different with a horde of new and powerful named to kill ranging from Generals, Priests, Captain of the Guards, Storm Guard Heros (Fighting on these new mounts ala Vhaksiz ;)), Overlord, and the newly refocused and rechanneled Avatar of War.  Of course, these new named would share the same difficult their last predicessors had when the armies of the mortals challenged them - massive melee dps.  **OPINON**  That's what made them fun.  None of this lets-train-1000-mobs-around-while-we-kill-the-boss.<br />
<br />
And, of course, it's Velious!  :D<br />
<br />
Sorry, I'm really, really bored here at work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The only problem with that is that not everyone has gone through all the content in the original kael, and if this was implemented, they'd be denied the ability to do so.  It would be sort of harsh for the up and coming players to be unable to get thurg quest armor, velious quest armors are a pretty big stepping stone on the way to uberness, for that matter so are Vindi and AoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i just want to see castle mistmoore become a level 65 raid zone ala LDoN ( tailored to raidforce ). take the same mobs; make them all level 65 with FULL offensive and defensive cababilities as PC's; open up a new lower level dungeon beneath it with all kinds of nastiness; and make the pathing EXACTLY as screwed up as it is now.<br />
<br />
That, my friend, would be a dream come true. At least in my demented mind it would be. In the history of EQ I have never seen anything etch such a serious fear of a zone in my life as Castle Mistmoore. Old Chardok was bad ( it used to be really bad pathing, etc. ); Old CT was fun as hell when the AoF would level the zone; Guk and SolB were too busy to ever be a threat; even the first romp through KC when the highest level people were 50 was fun. But.....Mistmoore make them look like Orc 1.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, pity too.  That's exactly why an expansion such as this would never happen though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'd personally take the expansion where they go thru and fix all the itemization, rebalance everything, and fix all the bugs.<br />
<br />
But hey, that's just me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">They'd probably need more than a 6 month lead in to do that though :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">that would be cool but i like fighting king T and Vindi and when you mean make AoW harder or easier? I have yet to face AoW but i've wanted to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Judin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I am sure they can log the activity in all zones over a trending period (2-3 months) and determine who uses what and what is NOT being used anymore.  Think about the content in Runney Eye, Befallen, Mistmore, Paw, The Karanas, Beholder's, etc.  There are a ton of areas that are rarely used and could easily be 'upgraded' to accomodate the changing game.  Sure they did it with CT and now Droga, etc...but there are a lot of zones and content that could be modified still.  Spread out those XPers :)  Just say no to over crowding!!</div></div><hr />

One of the few zones that gave me cold chills the 1st time we ventured in. And I remember thinking &quot;WTH is a Dark Huntress?&quot; As she proceeded to spank our band of intrepid adventurers. Fun yet frightening...&quot;Train to zone, and HELL's coming with me!&quot;</div></div><hr />
