<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">01-18-2005, 05:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">CE had its impact reduced with the Arrival of WA5.<br />
Before that they were supreme later they combined each over multiplicatively not additively.<br />
This of course got quickly fixed because it made CE really overpowered.<br />
<br />
CE will add a lot less than you think, since it does not &quot;add up/stack&quot; with WA5, <br />
<br />
WA5 CE0=  2x50% = 3 PPM<br />
WA5 CE10=  2x50 &amp;  2x10% = 3.2 PPM (and not 3.3 PPM)<br />
WA5 CE50= 2x50 &amp; 2x50% = 4 PPM (and not 4.5 PPM)<br />
<br />
It is not ... 2x50% = 3 PPM, now add CE to that 3 PPM.<br />
<br />
That beeing sad i had  CE19/29 and absolutely loved it, the impact is significat enough<br />
to feel it and also parse it. The problem is you loose too many tanking oriented stats :(<br />
<br />
/loves that CE15 Quarm earring !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">01-18-2005, 05:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">moreover CE10=/=10% it's closer to 8.6% with less than 1% error thus it can't ever reach 10%<br />
thank Torrin for parsing it.</div></div><hr />

I'm sure there's probably some other stuff in anguish too.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">01-28-2005, 06:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah with this list a warrior could have CE101 so might be inteesting to know where is the CE cap (got reports of it being at 30 or 50 or 70 or 100 :( quite a big difference between sources).<br />
<br />
EDIT: Emilia, does CE affect spell proc (SotP) or not (like WA) ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">01-28-2005, 07:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">WA does affect SoPM thats absolutely sure, sice i had a 1.56 to 1.75 average PPM if i remember well proc rate.<br />
<br />
BoW+A3+CE25 = 3.2 &amp; 3.2 &amp; 1.7 or something like that dont remember exactly.<br />
Parses went from 7.5 to 9 PPM. (Did in total 6x30min parse for SoPM)<br />
<br />
And since i didnt know how to use EQMacro, couldnt wait to just click on SoPM every 30 mins.<br />
The &quot;regular&quot; parse 8-18h like Torrins and had the predicted results considering the parameters.<br />
<br />
But i lost everything when our site went down.<br />
<br />
My guess would be that it does, but 6x30 mins is way too low for a reliable sample.<br />
And 1.3 to 1.8 or something similar can be easily attributed to the RNG.<br />
<br />
The proof : 13 Ruj Venom &amp; 5 Frozen Shards on a Huvul Strategist in MPG.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tohkin</div><div class="date">01-28-2005, 08:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I never had SoTPM before WA, but I'm under the impression that mine is procing 2PPM since I've had it. I don't think WA affects it and I would also assume that CE wouldn't affect it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">01-28-2005, 09:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">WA doesn't affect directly the thrid proc ... actually increasing the ppms decrease the ird proc ppm. look  at parses on Pal boards: <br />
WA0 CE0 -&gt; 2ppm +2ppm +1.9ppm<br />
WA5 CE0 -&gt; 3ppm +2.9ppm +1.5ppm<br />
WA doesn't increase third proc ppm, does it shouldn't affect it. However due to proc mecanics (you can proc only once per swing, you can proc only once each proc per round, you can't proc on ripost and flurry, proc check is ordered innate&gt;aug&gt;spell) when the ppm of the first proc increases it gives less occasion for other procs to fire, same for the aug proc decreasing the spell proc. <br />
Indeed, when you proc from the weapon and the aug in a round, you need at lest to get a triple (or a puni with 2Her) to give a chance at the third proc to fire. decreasing the overall ppm of the third proc. that's why WA does affect indirectly the third proc.<br />
But a non procing weapon, without aug but with spell proc will have a 2ppm with or without WA5. I guessed it was alike with CE but prefered to check.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Yoda.</div></div><hr />

to click on SoTPM 3.0 secs , wont really screw up the data.<br />
<br />
Gonna use MSC and Velium Gemmed Warspear as references.<br />
I do hope 1h30 ish tries give me some more info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">01-28-2005, 10:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thoeritically, the statistical error should be 1/sqrt(N), N being the number of attempt to proc (success or fail doesn't matter). Success are easy to calculate but fail is trickier. On very large sample I use the total number of procs assuming that it will always be much lower of the total attempt of one proc. But since you want shorter parses, we can try this formula N*=Swing#-Innate_proc#-aug_proc#-2*Flurry# (-riposts#, but you will hit from back isn't it) hopping that the game mecanics I described is accurate enougth to get a good correlation between N and N*.<br />
Thus, to increase N* you should get as much haste that you can during theese two parses.<br />
<br />
let's see what results you will get.<br />
Have fun,<br />
Yoda.<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT : if you are really bored, you can try anothre proc parse: equip a procing weapon in offhand and leave the mainhand empty. You can use the SotP but you shouldn't proc from it so it's pointless, the aim is to swing the slower than you can and check the procs firing. You be able to get some firing without it's associated swing (it's parsed in the library but it's so weird that it may have changed or hav been logs behaviors).<br />
Oh, and if you still have nothing better to do, there a really quick parse that might be nice to see: buy a weighted axe (really cheap usually) aug it whith whatever you want get as much slow as you can and you should get a pitfull ppm since that 70% slow gives less round per minutes that WA5&amp;CE&amp;ç give normal ppms. This would prove that you can't proc more than once each aug per round.</div></div><hr />

1:10:09 secs , thats 70 minutes. <br />

128 Procs of &quot;PestilenceEffect&quot;<br />

Guess SoPM does proc around 2PPM without any external parameters. My bad :)</div></div><hr />
