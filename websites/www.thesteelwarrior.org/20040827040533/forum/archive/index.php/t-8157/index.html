<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Words cannot describe the appreciate and exhiliaration I had tonight.  My guild just defeated The Rathe Council!  Not only that, but it was our very first attempt at it.  All the team work, all the gearing up, and all the work I've put into my guild payed off so much tonight.  <br />
<br />
I can't sleep now.  I still have a couple gallons left of adrenaline running through my arteries.  It's just such an awesome feeling to have beaten this encounter, and have beaten it on our very first attempt to boot!<br />
<br />
/uncontrollable giddyness<br />
<br />
Anyhoo, I just want to thank you all for the endless amount of reading I've done on this board to further better a player I can be.  I wouldn't have even a fraction of the knowledge that I have if it wasn't for you guys.  How mob damage works, what discs do, and generally how to be a great warrior.  <br />
<br />
PS - We only had one major set back during the script, but it wasn't anything of our own messup or wrong doing I guess.  It's a long ass script, I'll tell you that.  You can't rush through it by any means.  We had five of the councilmen locked down at the rear of the cave, when all the sudden I read in /gu<br />
<br />
&quot;Is it just my screen or did that councilman vanish?&quot;<br />
<br />
Vanish?  What the hell.  I frantically looked around.  The script takes time and patience.  Having that work you just did to beat him down, get him debuffed, and keep him locked down thrown underneath the carpet for you sucked.  Where did we find the Hudini?  At his bind point, peacefully regenning his health around the blue campfire.  Mind you, the councilman regen very, very slowly.  We had to sit there and wait a half an hour for him to regen from 5% up to 100% so he wouldn't annihilate our pullers on agro.  The councilmen quad hard and fast for like 3k, and the mezzables retain their strength no matter how much health they have.  <br />
<br />
It sucked having to sit there and wait, but two hours later, the Avatar of Earth's corpse was at our feet.  Rather odd occurance though.<br />
<br />
**PSS - This is not Time access for my guild, unfortunately.  We have yet to kill Coirnav due to another guild steadily working on it.  They've tried 7-8x now, so hopefully they'll beat it eventually.  /shrug</div></div><hr />
