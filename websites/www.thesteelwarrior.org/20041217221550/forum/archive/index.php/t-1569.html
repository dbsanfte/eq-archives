<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">06-27-2003, 11:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Each island has small mobs that you must kill to get the first part of the keys.  After the minor mobs, you have to kill the islands boss to get Sirran the Lunatic to spawn.  You then turn in the first part to recieve the actual key to move on.  Keeper of Souls is the boss of his island, thus you must kill him.  Note: do not kill the boss until all of the minor mobs are dead (unless the minor mobs will not aggro you).  Sirran does assist, and will kick your ass if you fight near him.</div></div><hr />

If you've got a sufficient force for the spiroc island though, he won't be at all an issue.  He's easier than the Spiroc Lord.</div></div><hr />

<br />
One miscalculation can end the raid. It is expensive and long. When you go, get some other warriors to come as well. There are quest items here that rock, including a 41 Haste Warrior Belt. <br />
<br />
Most classes can get something out of this raid.<br />
<br />
Look around and you will find a few guides still up on it.  I am going through this same thing now. On our first attempt, Sirran timed out before everyone got their key on one isle.<br />
<br />
So that was 400pp per player + wizzie port rune costs and a good part of a Saturday spent. But we learned and are going back.<br />
<br />
You'll need plenty of clerics, a necro or two, and to cut down on time, buy the first two keys.  The guides have good estimates of the number of folks required and levels.<br />
<br />
I am working on a plan based on the guides I found (some do conflict) and I am going to test it out when we go back. If it works well, I'll try to find a place to post it.<br />
