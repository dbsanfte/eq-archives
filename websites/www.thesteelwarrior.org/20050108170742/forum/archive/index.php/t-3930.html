Last night I went to help a guildie get there bod out of fear. being the semi noob that i am i said sure. we got him out but had 3 people die. then we go back in to get them with now only 3 people in gear and we all whipe. so then we get a decent size raid force of about 3 groups average lvl of 62 but one group with no gear and guess what the whole raid whipes. then to make matters worse on the way back after this death my cable company has to do network service and i go ld for the night so as i write this my body is rotting in pof and i have no idea how to get it out. it seems as if as soon as i zone in half he zone jumps on me and summons me all over the place so i dont even know where my body is. any suggestions would be appreciated. thanks in advance.<br />

<br />
Just have someone with some HP (warrior does fine), get invised and zone in. <br />
<br />
Get as much aggro as he can and Kite every things away and keep kiting until all corpses are dragged to the safe points (west wall) and rez.<br />
<br />
For the kiter, there are several ways to get him out. CoTH works the best or you can just do the timing and evacing.<br />
<br />
This same method can be used for initial zone in so no one will get unnecessary aggro (except the kiter) before getting to the zone in.<br />
<br />
Just dun aggro those DT golems while kiting. Sow is enough to outrun, only thing to worry is being rooted.<br />
