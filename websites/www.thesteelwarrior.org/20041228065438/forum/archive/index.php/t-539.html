<br />
heres my latest issue, <br />
<br />
currently wearing indicolite arms and  boots, they are nice AC, but the stats are kinda odd, especially the boots with the wis and int, any suggestions on what a dwarf war could save up for these areas, im thinking of getting some more enchanted dwarven plate for those areas and turning in the old stuff for xp<br />
<br />
but i thought id check here for suggestions first<br />
<br />
also anyone know how much xp i can expect to get per piece at lvl 51-52ish</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">05-09-2003, 12:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cobalt boots and arms are both 25AC with clicky effects - str buff on the boots, minor shielding on the vambs so those are both respectable and not too expensive in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
Champions (thurgadin quest) both pieces have 24AC and some minor stats.  MQs for boots and arms wouldnt cost more than 1-2k each.<br />
<br />
Crystal Chitin Arms and boots have respectable AC (arms 18, boots 20) and reasonable stats, but are usable by more classes so the price can be a little higher on these.<br />
<br />
And ofcourse plenty of other options out there too, Enchanted Dwarven plate, the new Dorf Cultural stuff(will cost more but will last you alot longer than the other options), heavy / worked / reinforced dragon scale stuff from WW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">05-09-2003, 02:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually the ac on the champs boots is 25, with like +2 or 3 to a couple of stats.  str and sta I think, but can't remember for sure. (at work so cant check)  They are a decent upgrade to cobalt, but cobalt boots effectively have +25 str if you're not grouped with someone that can buff your str. (kunzar doesnt stack with druid/shammy str, but I keep mine bagged for just that reason).  I'm still in indicolite arms too, and I like the stats on 'em. And 20 AC is definitely nice for the low 50's warrior.  Like Eoden said, there's a ton of stuff out there, just check out which quests (or MQ's) are most attainable, compare with what's being sold in the bazaar, and go from there.<br />

But hey, better than nothing I guess. Just wasted bank space that would have been destroyed down the road sometime anyway.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smakz</div><div class="date">05-12-2003, 07:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, um, Cobalt peices, Thurg Peices, really, any peices Kunark or later will prolly be a better choice.<br />
<br />
Try go get Thurg MQs, probably your best option, or get in on a Pick up PoG raid (they gotta still be common) score some berzerkers, its basically the same shit as Thurg.</div></div><hr />
