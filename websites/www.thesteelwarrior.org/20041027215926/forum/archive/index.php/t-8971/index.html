Frog thinks that GOOD Warriors will be in steady demand in WoW!<br />

thank you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Very true, a well played warrior at this point in the development is simply a sight to behold. They truely are the best at what they do. <br />
<br />
I'd like ot note that thats just from a min/max standpoint and the fact that warriors have talents, which many classes still lack. I read a dev post where his said something along the lines that people will really need to get out of there EQ mindsets. The warrior is awesome because he has so many tools at his disposal to do his main functions, damage (and they can dish a quite a bit) and tanking (no question at this point, no other class has the agro and defesive capabilities of the warrior).<br />
<br />
Warrior, rogue, preist, and mage, the four &quot;pure&quot; classes have all been given talents and other classes still have yet to be fully fleshed out. I expect when those 4 are adequately balanced, then the main brunt of the balancing for the rest of the classes will happen. Something that will happen soon, druid and shaman are getting talents tenatively set for the next big patch.<br />
<br />
With only warriors, and paladins for the alliance, able to wear the heaviest armor, I expect that the tank slot will more often than not be open in many groups and good warriors will be in great demand.</div></div><hr />
