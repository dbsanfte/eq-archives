Guild did him lastnight. I was not on to remind them of the strat. I started thinking about it and now relize I am missing alot of the strat also. We are pulling more for raids than  before. More lik 50-60 now. They said he left the room somehow. No idea how that would happen lol. Any help would be great. Hopefully one of you can dig up the old thread.<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seriously, after you get the spiders locked down, as soon as he is targetable you should be ready to go. Normally I just run in and pull him to corner and then call the raid in.<br />
<br />
Sounds like you took too long engaging him after he was targetable.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Keane Abrams</div><div class="date">06-30-2004, 01:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">MB will frequently leave his room due to his AE aggroing a loose pet. MB has a very large AE range (larger than his room). This is likely what happened to your guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">06-30-2004, 01:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The AE's are designed to make rushing the room and getting set up difficult, so don't rush the room. Set up in Behemoth room before Behemoth wakes up, as soon as the spider killing begins. Put tanks closest, healers furthest, and wait ~10 minutes while the spider groups do their thing. Then Behemoth will have no reason to leave the room, and there will be no confusion related to rushing into the room later.</div></div><hr />

If so, how far can you get him away from his room?  We always rush him, 2 forces from either side, but I would like to try something else for later kills of him.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Eek!<br />
<br />
Can you imagine zoning into PoI expecting to set up a yard trash group ... and then find this SOB there??<br />
<br />
(The thought of it made me laugh out loud at work!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Keane Abrams</div><div class="date">06-30-2004, 03:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, he is leashed. He will quickly warp back to his spawn point if pulled too far out of his room. And btw, he leashes back to full health.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">06-30-2004, 08:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, his leash limit is in the hallway just outside his doors.  I don't think he can touch the wall opposite his doors without warping home.<br />
<br />
Many mobs were given leashes that never used to have them.  For example, the days of seeing Emperor Ssra at zone in are gone. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ya thats what I would of forced if I was there. Thanks for puting my doubts to rest guys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Northerner</div><div class="date">07-01-2004, 02:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some guilds like to pull him just into the hallway to ensure that the Gnome won't die to loose spiders but I've never been a big fan of that myself.  He is tethured but will certainly come into the hall.<br />
<br />
In general though, I've never seen any real need to setup in the room ahead of time.  We'd typically just have a paladin watching for when he is targettable, then run in and DA position him fairly centrally with his back to whichever side we set the rangers and such up on.  Clerics MGB an elixer and warrior charges from the other side.  Burn and FD pull the gnome to a hall of choice.</div></div><hr />
