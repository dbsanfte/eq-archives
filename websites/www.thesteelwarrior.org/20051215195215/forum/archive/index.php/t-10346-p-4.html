<br />
The fucking difference between a warrior and a wizard is ARMOR, and always has been.  Sure, the warrior might have a couple pounds of muscle for padding, but realistically, is he fucking superman just because he's a warrior?  No.  He's just an average guy who grabbed his sword to fight the Horde.  EQ got way fucking out of hand with HP issues, so this is kind of refreshing in a way, at least for me.<br />
<br />
Now, I know that wizards don't exist (had to remind myself the Mithril wasn't a real metal a couple weeks ago), but the same can be said for the difference between a footman and an archer.  They're both basically the same guys..but one takes damage a lot differently than the other, due to what they're wearing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">01-25-2005, 12:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree, I prefer this system too where the hp difference isn't that large at all.  Once you start making warriors have significantly higher hp naturally, you have to balance to one or the other (warriors vs everyone else with significantly lower hp) for the solo part of the game which Blizzard is adamant upon keeping.<br />
<br />
Having the classes with similar numbers of hp (or at least potentially similar numbers if they had the right equipment), and the warrior advantage being their armor and abilities, is the only way to balance it correctly.  Thankfully this isn't EQ and Warriors have a shitload more than just &quot;hit autoattack and pray&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deurgeran</div><div class="date">01-26-2005, 12:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">However, having pretty much the same mitigation as a Paladin(both in plate) with the same HP is NOT unbalancing?  Especially when they can heal themselves?  Without being significantly behind us in DPS?<br />
<br />
I, for the most part, like the more realistic idea of having HP total's a lil more equal than they was in EQ.  It makes more sense, however, we SHOULD have a more HP than anyother class, but a decent margin not just the 100 200 I see above.  Now, I'm not saying we return to the day's of EQ with 15K warrior's or anything, but we should be able to take a hit or two more than a paladin when we're Exiscerated for 1200 from the rogue that decided to pop in and say hello, either through more HP, more mitigation or both.  <br />
<br />
As it stand's now, the survivability is not high enough for warrior's to make up for our shortcomings, and the above posts with the different HP per class prove it.  We eitehr need a bump in mitigation (accross all build types of warrior's) a bump in HP accross the whole class, or a lil of both.  <br />
<br />
If Blizzard want's to keep us innately worse than other clases from a DPS standpoint, but be able to absorb alot more damage than any other class then its fine by me, I like to tank .... by all means do the whole thing, not just one part of it.   There needs to be a reason to pick a warrior to tank.  As it is now, a play can be tank and group healer for most fights and when they come up against a boss, they simply concentrate on healing themselves, AND they can rez.  That's a big advantage desirability for groups since priests and druid's are NOT the most abundant class.</div></div><hr />

Just wanted to add this, even though it's been a week since it was posted.<br />
<br />
There's a quote from Kalgan about your point about paladins from his several post-long talk.  I'll add the actual quote here later, but Kalgan actually said that Paladins were intended to be the best tank mitigation-wise, not Warriors, or something like that.  That people often think that the Warrior is supposed to be the best, but that's not how they designed it.<br />
<br />
You forget though that Paladins don't have the huge agro difference in this game that they did in EQ.  Warriors have much better agro if they use Sunder and other abilities.  Paladins cannot hold agro on multiple mobs very easily...it's difficult enough holding on just one if they don't get a short time solo like warriors needed in EQ until higher levels, but they still have problems.<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT:  Here's the quote:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Q u o t e:<br />
<br />
Survivability: As a tank Warriors have a low survivability. Paladins have equal AC, as well as self heals and invulnerability to help themselves. This arguement has been heard many times, but it is valid and worth mentioning. <br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Agreed, this argument has been heard many times. However, it’s also worth mentioning that not only are there some balance issues being resolved with Paladins (ie: the fix to seal of the crusader which gives paladins both superior survivability and superior damage output), but there are some things I should clarify about the design intent of warriors and paladins. <br />
<br />
While paladins are indeed intended to be the most survivable of any class in the game (players sometimes assume warriors are, which is not the case), paladins aren’t intended to make the best “tanks” in the game, or to have superior offensive abilities then warriors. What this means is that survivability alone does not a tank make. <br />
<br />
The other key concept to tanking is the ability to hold agro on mobs (especially simultaneously on multiple mobs). This is the key difference between warriors and paladins in PvE. Simply put, warriors are intended to be the best at holding agro against multiple mobs (which will also be a more clear distinction once the Seal of the Crusader bug is fixed). So, assuming a group scenario that includes healers, a warrior’s survivability rivals that of a paladin’s, with the warrior having very significant advantages in terms of holding agro.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are we playing the same game here?<br />
<br />
For starters, warriors mitigation is better by an order of magnitude than pallies, when we're in defensive.  Their survivability is notably better,  but then it had better be considering the punching bags that they are in PvP.  War may be at a noteable disadvantage toe to toe in the current situation, but then there isn't any fight with a pally you can't walk away from at your choosing.<br />
<br />
There is a distinct aggro difference.  Warriors single target aggro, and aggro for 2-3 mobs is significantly better than pallies.  However, after that, if they're properly spec'd, pallies outaggro us on groups of larger enemies just by using consecration. (Their heals don't pull much aggro.)  Thier snap aggro sucks, but if you're not losing it in the first place, thats somewhat nonfactor. ^^</div></div><hr />
