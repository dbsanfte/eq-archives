Not to mention at level 70 LDoN exp is basically non-existant. Sony needs to either add level 66+ options for LDoN or give us freaking Anger procs and Ykesha type procs that drop elsewhere. I still need about 500 points in Guk LDoN to get an Anger3 augment for my epic, and I haven't seen any hate related augments drop anywhere...and so far I have gotten 51 points because an all 65 LDoN group was looking for a tank.<br />
<br />
However, even tanking for level 65 groups won't work because I'm the only one that got 51 points. The rest got ripped off and got like 41 pionts, so they asked if they could replace me after the first one. o.O</div></div><hr />

Also why should I be FORCED to have a 65 in the group?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kogur</div><div class="date">10-23-2004, 11:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That would be fine and dandy, except for the following:<br />
<br />
1.) The exp in BoT seems to be better at level 70(and I won't step foot into BoT at 70 because the exp is absolute shit)<br />
<br />
2.) No one 66+ wants to do LDoN because there are augments just as good or better in GoD and OoW(EXCEPT for the specific augments we as warriors need), along with better gear.<br />
<br />
3.) If you have a full strong group of level 70's you can't do LDoN at all...You are FORCED to have a 65 or below in the group. You say at no other level is there any possibility of doing the pevious levels normal LDoN's, but at the same time at no other level are you FORCED to bring a low level with you just to do them at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bardeil</div><div class="date">10-23-2004, 11:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1. True. However, XP in ldon has always sucked past the mid 50's though. BoT/LDoN xp sucks but it's really not so much worse than it was at 65. <br />
<br />
2. This is a problem. I saw a link to a dropped yak aug when oow first came out but haven't seen anything else recently. Like I said though, at 70 you should be able to handle normals with almost no healing anyway, so just get 6 warriors and practice bind wound if you have to :)<br />
<br />
3. My understanding is that hards are supposed to be able to be gotten by level 70's, you only need the 65 to get normals. I haven't tried it though. If you can't, it's bugged.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kogur</div><div class="date">10-23-2004, 11:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I tried yesterday, it said there were no adventures available for me at this time. The way it seems to work is this...<br />
<br />
First, to get an LDoN at all at least one person must be 65 or below in the group(I think they also have to get the adventure). If your groups average level is 64-67 you can select a normal or hard adventure,  and recieve a level 65 normal or hard adventure(and the lower level folks get ripped off by recieving less points for completion); however, if you groups average level is 68+ you can ONLY select normal adventures...and you recieve a 65 hard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ealsur Helevorn</div><div class="date">10-23-2004, 12:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">At 67, I got normal 65 and hard 65 adventures by myself, never got any message saying I couldnt. There was a bug on OoW release tho, but it has been fixed it seems.<br />
<br />
I always group with the same bunch of friends, and yes, people are more into OoW, but that happens with all new expansions, right? When LDoN was out, everyone wanted to do adventures and most people I asked prefered adventures than going to BoT at that time. Its normal that with the release of OoW people stopped doing adventures.<br />
<br />
By the way, there is an Ykesha aug dropping in OoW, called Bite of Ykesha, not sure where tho.<br />
<br />
If your group average is 68+, you should be ashamed of asking for a 65 normal :p Come on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kogur</div><div class="date">10-23-2004, 01:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I couldn't get the adventure yesterday. I tried, we had 3 level 70s a 69 and two 68's in group...we ended up having to haev the 69 leave and get a 65 before we could get one. I'll try it again today when I get home, we'll see. <br />
<br />
The bite of Ykesha is a type 4 augment, and I have to haev a type 8 augment. =(<br />
<br />
Also, LDoN was popular ever since LDoN came out...but now it's totally abandoned in my experience.</div></div><hr />

I get 105 or so points pr lvl 70 normal adventure. Mobs hit for around 1100 and have reasonable ammounts of hp, so basically they are about the same as a 65 Hard, maybe a little harder.<br />
<br />
That being said, yup, it's hard getting people to go do a LDoN adventure these days and it would be nice if some thing was done either via new LDoN Merchant equipment or an xp bonus added to lvl 70 adventures, so that it would be worth the time spent doing the adventures if you weren't in need of the points.</div></div><hr />

70 normals are the same as 65 hards.  But yeah it's hard to find people unless they're lvl 70 because it sucks for regular xp but at 70 it's still alright aaxp considering you get points too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyone have any experience with the new cleric level 70 pacify?  Does it actually work in high risk LDoNs?<br />
<br />
The thing that pisses me off about &quot;suppose to be doing high risks at level 70&quot;, is that since my cleric's level 65 pacify is pretty much completely ineffective in a high risk LDoN they're impossible to pull on my own.  I've enjoyed 3 and 4 boxing LDoNs, but since pacify is worthless in high risks, I don't even get to &quot;attempt&quot; them cause they'd be 100% sure fire suicide runs.  I can handle any mob inside that dungeon with ease, yet because of the ineffectiveness of one single spell, the transition from normal to high risk LDoNs goes from pathetically easy to completely impossible.  It goes from fighting one pathetic 300 hitter to a guarenteed train of two, three, four or more 900 hitters every pull.  If the high risks were pullable by the same classes that can pull normal risks, I'd have no problem at all.<br />
<br />
If the level 70 pacify works in high risk as good as the level 65 pacify worked in normal risks, then I'll be good to go in the &quot;future&quot;... but if it doesn't, I'm kinda miffed about having the ability to do LDoNs on my own taken from me.  Feign death and Fading Memories didn't all of a sudden become completely useless when going from normal to high risk adventures, so why in the hell did pacify?  The mobs are below level 65, so it's not like the spell just wasn't meant for the area... yet it still doesn't work worth crap.  Bards only get to use their's cause it doesn't require line of sight, which doesn't aggro the mobs, and they get to try over and over till it sticks... then fade memories if they make a mistake.  Clerics however, are just screwed, which knocks my only way of pulling out, and I don't even get to &quot;attempt&quot; the level of LDoN adventure that I'm &quot;suppose&quot; to be doing at my level (66+)... unless I bring along someone who can feign, or a bard.<br />
<br />
I think it's stupid that something that would be easy for me becomes impossible to even attempt simpley because of one stupid spell/skill that someone else gets.  Or rather, I think it's stupid that something that would normally be easy for me becomes impossible to even attempt simpley because one stupid pulling spell of mine is disabled while all of the other classes's get to keep theirs!</div></div><hr />

If they added better gear to LDoN for level 70 players, the elitists would be up in arms against it. OMG someone might get a 75HP aug without raiding!</div></div><hr />

Yes, normal 70 mobs are exactly the same as hard 65s.  Normal 70s are also 105 points for a win.</div></div><hr />

Nope, 40 hp augs are very difficult to come by outside of LDoN and now because I can't get anyone to LDoN, including guildmates it seems I will have to wait a very long time to get any.  I still need an A3 aug for a 2hander (when I get one).  Also need one for when/if I finish my epic 1.5.  Fortunately I have the points saved for one of these, but still that is 40 hp augs, 10 AC augs and at least one A3 aug I am not going to be able to get any time in the near future.<br />
<br />
BTW, for this post I'm considering casual any guild that doesn't raid GoD or beyond because that is where the raid quality augs drop.<br />

On a happier note, EP flagged as of last night.  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
LDoN has always needed something to bridge the gap between mobs that max for 360 or so and mobs that hit for over 900.  Nice progression, SOE. :p  And yeah, L65 pac pulling a hard ldon is suicide because of the high resist rates.  Overall the risk vs. reward for a L70 ldon just blows, so people don't do them.<br />
<br />
I'd like to see some other ways to get anger augs and some of the other types of gear there because yes, LDoN is pretty much dead now.  Oh well, I never liked those lame, cookie cutter, ranch home style dungeons.</div></div><hr />

To the original poster: Try to get youself a good base of friends. Tell them what you need. If they're real friends they'll be glad to help. It has worked for me.</div></div><hr />

War/war/pal/clr/clr/enc. It was, in general, a joke compared to what hard level 65 ldons used to be. Sure the max hit is still 946 or whatever, but those extra levels seem to reduce the aggro radius on the mobs, and they in general couldn't hit us very hard. We completed it in 60 minutes with 0 dps classes. <br />
<br />
Honestly, if these aren't pretty easy for you at 70, you probably levelled yourself out of your equipment or friends.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Did you pull the entire adventure using the chanter?  Or just the one cast on the one mob and got lucky?<br />

Monk lull is unresistable, so that will of course always work just fine.</div></div><hr />

More so with Guk, which actually still is my fave theme. I'd be willing to trade plat for ldon points so I can get the few augments I still want without having to pull peoples teeth to go there, or deal with lame exp..cookiecutter design..10+ mins to get something BUT rescue..<br />
In my opinion, ldon stuff needs a major overhaul. Make those dropped +6 rot augments sellable for points would be nice. Making old augments removable and re-sellable was a step in the right direction, but not far enough.<br />

You would generate more hate per minute if you put your bloodfreenzy into your main hand and offhand your epic.<br />
<br />
I can't imagine having trouble with aggro with that set up, but if you do,  take all the the energy you spend trying to do old content and work on geting your lvl 69 tomb.  That is a significant step up to the lvl 65 incite plus it's available on demand.  <br />
<br />
In addition to the increase in exp from being in more active zones where groups are more availble you will also find that their are augments for your gear in nearly every zone in oow.  It may not be the way you planed to skin the cat but it's what i would do if i were in your shoes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">czai</div><div class="date">10-27-2004, 05:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd settle for:<br />
<br />
1) No more &quot;unlocking&quot; themes -- let me buy whatever I want even if I've gotten all my points in just BB / EF.<br />
<br />
2) More points per adventure.<br />
<br />
A nice bonus would be upping the XP in the adventures and maybe adding a few new (random, droppable) items/augs that can be turned in for extra points.<br />
<br />
LDoN was a good expansion when it was released and it could still be good if it was tweaked a little to accomodate the growing pains of the game.  The same holds true for other zones.</div></div><hr />

Not the whole adv, just a handful of times when busting into crowded rooms.<br />

However, at 70 you'd be surprised how low the agro radius is.</div></div><hr />

I don't think we had more than a double pull except maybe once. We did get a nice train when a baddie got off a gate, but the enchanter was able to lock it down eventually.<br />
<br />
105 pts in 60 minutes without biting your nails is pretty smooth in my book.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Honestly in my opnion the aggro on epic A3x2 aug and Bloodfrenzy A3 aug are roughly equivalent on aggro due to the epic FAR greater ratio( 0.92 on epic, 1.25 on Bloodfrenzy). I never said I had aggro problems, but the &quot;energy I spend trying to do old content&quot; is due to the fact that there are NO replacements in the newer content for a type 8 anger augment(I've looked high and low, no aggro related type 8 augs have been found that I'm aware of). <br />
<br />
I already have the 69 Bazu Bellow(that's a complaint for another thread, this being our ONLY new disc worth the endurance usage) so that's not an issue. I'm not looking to LDoN for HP augs or AC augs: I'm too lazy to farm points for that crap. At any rate, I managed to force my buddies into LDoN to help me get the SEVEN Guk LDoNs that I needed...in seven Guk LDoN advenures I got a WHOPPING 3AAs.</div></div><hr />
