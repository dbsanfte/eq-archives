<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">For those who collect the knowledge of Norrath, here is a story that was told to me last ngiht while travelling though Plane of Knowledge. A Barbarian woman, Gara Tidyngs, appeared and began her tale....<br />
<br />
  <br />
T’was a long time ago, ere your time. Even the Dwarves have lost memories of that event. After Veeshan had brought life to Norrath;  She settled into the Plane of Sky and drew a veil across the chasm separating the dragon plane from us. Than she fell into a long and peaceful slumber.<br />
<br />
So too did the dragons still left on Norrath, as their strength was derived from the Plane, and the Veil kept them from exercising their magical powers.<br />
Ya see, lads and lasses, the Ring of Scale dinna take kindly to mortals meddling in their affairs, and the Veil did well to prevent that. <br />
<br />
Aye; but the Dragons slept; and the Veil fell into neglect; until mortals began to find cracks and once more make inroads into the Plane of Sky.<br />
<br />
On Norrath; the dragon Zavo’Zatanov and her accomplices were determined to remove the Veil and restore the power to the Ring of Scale. Not your normal group of travelers were these. Though they called themselves brother and sister; they were clearly not so.<br />
<br />
Zavo, a High Elven woman of exquisite beauty; Rals’Zezonis, strongly Human; Sarethsin’Kaz, a typically snobby Erudite; and rounding out this already peculiar group was a Troll named Soreg’Sslisn.<br />
<br />
Great Rewards and Dangerous Adventure they promised, fortune and glory to all who could hear, and not an ear on the land missed their call. And what could possibly be the goal of such a motley group, forcing them to enlist the aid of total strangers?<br />
Like a knife, the next two words sliced through the cold night air, silencing all within hearing<br />
<br />
“Lady Vox.“ Lady Vox holds that which we seek.<br />
<br />
Through Blackburrow did they Venture; the Gnolls rejoicing that they did not stay their journey. Thence through Everfrost, which some say melted a little under the presence of such a horde. <br />
On to Permafrost, the lair of Lady Vox.<br />
<br />
The group paused, casters with their noses buried deep within their books, murmuring arcane phrases; warriors unsheathing their blades, donning helms, whilst the smaller folk faded in and out of view. Suddenly; out of the bleak mountains of Ever frost a voice rang out. That is when they first heard:<br />
<br />
”Vile Children of Scale, Your Efforts are wasted this Day! You were fools to think you could stand against the fury of Mistmoore!”<br />
<br />
The sound echoed off the cavern walls. Out of the shadows sprung the horror, three Tier’Dal soldiers; Agents of the dreaded Vampire Lord. Lord Galendor, nightmare of Mistmoore and chief enforcer of Mayong himself; led the charge leveling a furious attack at the High Elven woman, Zavo, before they had any time to react. Khasra Vei’Ras was not far behind, and a Tier’Dal Priestess lent support from the shadows . . . D’shar was her name. Now; fighting a Tier’Dal Agent of the Vampire Lord might not seem to be such a difficult task . . . Until you turn and look to see her very life slipping away, slowly dripping down her tunic and staining the ground. This unholy union of Rage and Wit, Chaos and Order . . . it sticks with you.<br />
<br />
mesmerized; you see that Gara Tidyngs speaks of this with more than just a passing acquaintance with the issue<br />
<br />
Zavo and her companions defended themselves well, but they could have never lasted on their own. Luckily; they prepared themselves, enlisting the aid of some of the greatest that Norrath offered. The battle Was bloody, and before they even had time to organize themselves into some semblance of order, forty had become twenty. The tide began to turn for the heroes when one of the young Half Elf Warriors discovered the Tier’Dal cleric D’shar hiding in a corner and quickly dispatched her. Without a healing force, the Tier’Dal had no hope for Victory this day.<br />
<br />
Galendor fell almost immediately, and Khasra, badly wounded, stumbled backwards and uttered a few cryptic words.<br />
<br />
What followed sent a chill throughout the bones of all who were there to witness, and these were battle-hardened veterans that have seen some of the worst that Norrath had to offer. Ya see, the shadows crept out from the very stones beneath her feet, reaching up to envelop the Tier’Dal woman, swallowing her into darkness.<br />
<br />
Little did they know that while this was taking place, a dwarf rogue by the name of Kivgor Illbria had snuck into Vox’s Lair and had purloined the Shard. Loud and foul were the cries of anguish rumbling through the bowels of Permafrost when Vox discovered the Shard missing. Just as loud too were the cries of glee from Kivagor, taunting Vox for letting down her guard.<br />
<br />
His luck failed him, though.<br />
<br />
As he was about to make good his escape through the gates of the cavern, Kivgor ran headlong into Zavo’s group. Proud of his accomplishment, Kivgor waved the Shard before them, but his pride quickly turned to anguish when he discovered that this was the very Shard they were hunting. <br />
<br />
He attempted to flee, but they caught him and challenged him for rightful ownership of the Shard. Badly outnumbered, Kivgor stood nay chance at all, but he still fought for the Shard. His Dying words echoed throughout the chamber . . .<br />
<br />
“Fie on You, accursed Mistmoore! I fall in your favor, but now you be without your precious Trinket!”<br />
<br />
Mistmoore, mentioned Twice now? What role could Mistmoore play in this Drama?<br />
<br />
Ya see; Mayong Mistmoore was the bitter enemy of the Ring of Scale, and he wanted nothing more than to possess the Shard and thereby control access to the Plane of Sky.<br />
<br />
With all due haste, Zavo’s group journeyed to the Rathe Mountains, where the final partitioning of the Veil was to take place. Surrounded by their mortal supporters, Zavo and her friends shed their illusions and stepped forward to reveal their true dragon nature. However, before Zavo could reveal herself, the sky was suddenly filled w’shadows, while faint laughter swirled through the rising wind. A harsh voice, filled w’hatred and disgust, echoed through the mountainsides:<br />
<br />
”Children of Scale! You Shall Not Succeed this Night! I Will make sure of It!”<br />
“For centuries you have evaded me. Now this will end. Everything you possess . . . Is but a waste.”<br />
<br />
T’was the very voice of Mayong Mistmoore, challenging them for possession of the Shard.<br />
<br />
Quickly, the mortals sprang for the defense of the Scale, but it was too late for the doomed party. One by one; Mistmoore’s cold vampiric touch enveloped them in a misty vapor, draining their life and strengthening his. Fighting valiantly, the mortals appeared to be on the verge of victory, when suddenly Mayong faded from view, eluding their attacks. The shadows quickly retreated back to the corners and stones from which they were issued, their tendrils rising in the air and the sound of a thousand shrieks echoing throughout the Mountains of Rathe.<br />
<br />
As the shadows slithered from view; a voice was heard, faintly hissing these words of defeat:<br />
<br />
”You have won this Day, Children of Scale . . . But it will not be the last battle that you will face. Rend your Veil and harness your powers, it shall do nothing for you. You shall All perish, dragon and mortal alike, and your corpses shall rot at my feet.”<br />
For this I can assure you. Until that night comes, I bid thee a good morrow, and sleep well . . .<br />
<br />
The voice trailed off into a sadistic laughter that hung within the air for what seemed like an eternity before fading into the wind.<br />
Alas, Zavo mourned the loss of her beloved companions, cursing the name of Mistmoore. Determined to complete the quest which she had started; she called forward the human who had most distinguished himself into the battle. She asked him if he was ready for the final task, to die by the shard, spilling his blood upon the earth of Norrath so that the Veil would be sundered forever.<br />
<br />
He paused not a moment before nodding in agreement.<br />
<br />
After performing the sacrifice and resurrecting the hero, Zavo presented him w’the Shard, which became known thereafter as the Crystalline Claw of Veeshan. A mighty and powerful weapon. <br />
<br />
Furthermore in the realms of the Scale was his act bravely sung.<br />
<br />
Thus did the Veil of Veeshan become torn, and the realms of Mortals and Scale did mingle.<br />
<br />
The Dragons of Norrath were once more restored in power and glory; a fitting position for the Ring of Scale.<br />
<br />
Of the outcome of the battle between Mistmoore and the Ring of Scale, we can only guess. I am certain that the final pages of that Act have not been written.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Talic Moore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">So that's where the name came from. In my scrounging, I was only able to come up with some of the barest facts about Lady Zavo...<br />
<br />
Good to know where the bloody thing came from.<br />
<br />
Indeed, a good story, Shikarii.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Always you can rely on your half-elf warriors to pull the fat out of the fire whilst their brutish comrades slash away blindly.<br />
<br />
/evil grin</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">when one of the young Half Elf Warriors<br />
<br />
word em up</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>aakla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">That was from the tearing of the viel. the GM event that opened up Velious. if im not mistaken Mayong killed 3 dragons before the players chaed him off.<br />
<br />
did a NPC or GM realy tell you this story? if they did then they sound like they are going to bring Mayong back into the fold WOO HOO!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It was for the Crystal Claw of Veeshan GM event, rewarded to one person on every server who also obtained the Title xxxx the Scaled Claw. On most it went to rangers / warriors, xeg's went to some retarded rp pali who butted in at the last moment :b</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>aakla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yeah I missed the event but was told about it. wait thats right it wasnt for velious because it happened early in Kunark.<br />
<br />
I get all my events mixed up. I hope Mayong invades VP and takes out the Ring of Scale.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>aakla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I hope they come out with more history on mayong. acording to sony well the map they say that phiny and mayong are the 2 oldest beings on norath. this was back in classic EQ so that makes mayong older then nag and vox. <br />
<br />
so just how old is mayong? discriptions by NPC's make him out to be a high elf with the complection of a dark elf.<br />
<br />
the problem with Mayong is that alot of the lore is player lore and there are tons of contradiction all over the place about his past.<br />
<br />
most common is that he was a elf that liked music and he was having an affair with the elf queen. when she was kidnapped he begged innoruuk to spare the queen. innoruuk cursed him with eternal life instead just to piss him off.<br />
<br />
oh well maybe they here have more lore on him someday soon</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">yeah, it was a GM event...there wasn't a flagged GM or guide doing it ( green name ); but a blue name who told us the story. she had both her first and last name in the target box so i am assuming it was Gm controlled. why it caught my attention was that a long long time ago ( thinking about it now it might have been pre-velious even ) we had a gM event back on bertoxx where we followed some dragons and players through the same route they took and got to see Mayong Mistmoore himself...it was pretty cool. <br />
<br />
i'm guessing the continuation of the story will be in rathe mountains; near where the evil sphinx resides by the Dark Elf Camp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Niroth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Aye,<br />
<br />
I was there for the event on Rodcet last week, was kind of fun, then the GM passed out booze.  Kinda fun, wondering what is next?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The end did occur near the sphinx's in Rathe Mountains in game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Drunken Mick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Damn Kellaen... still bitter bout Allora gettin the claw? =P<br />
<br />
I recall she worked damn hard on that quest for quite awhile, leading us (at the time - not now) guildies all over to aid her.<br />
<br />
Yah... Allora still plays... pretty pimp pally now not quite as RP as she used to be :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">/hijack<br />
<br />
Bitter? I found it stupid, nothin to be bitter over tho. Was enough bs going on in that era on our server then to avert time agonizing over a gm event, mearly stated it was stupid. Don't recognize the name, assuming you were BoN at one point.<br />
<br />
Anyway to get back on track, the story tellers are supposedly going through some of the main plot lines in the comming month. I heard mention of dagnor and the bb hammer being resurfaced, tho it was really just a lore backstory event not game world changing like Mayong and the ring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>slyse</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">my guildleader  was the guy who ran the MM event on quellious back in the day, ended up with the crystal claw and the title &quot;champion of scale.&quot;  He's a pally, too =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Drunken Mick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Yup back before the server splits started happening, new content and space (Kunark), Xegony was a cesspool of constant training KS'ing, &lt;you ninja looted my cleric bp, carmine robe et al&gt; and general flaming.  Yers is one of the few names along with Emile's that I even recognize from Xeg days.  Not sure what other old school peeps that stayed behind are doing if even still playing.  Anywho, I don't see it as stupid really but hey difference of opinion and I didn't see any need to put Allora down.  /shrug.<br />
<br />
And ya I was in BoN which has basically become Forged Souls on 7th Hammer.</div></div><hr />
