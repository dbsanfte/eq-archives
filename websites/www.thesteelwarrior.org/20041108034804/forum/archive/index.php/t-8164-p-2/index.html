You could enter the zones, sure, but you sure as fuck arent going to be able to do jack shit once youre there.  I've been to the EP's, and if youre not geared/ready for the content then youre fucking useless.  The locks/flags on the zone are a good thing.<br />
<br />
You are just fuckin talkin to hear yourself talk now.  You dont' have a fuckin clue.  What zone in velious could I access but sure as hell couldn't do jack shit in?  There isn't one zone in velious besides sleepers that I couldn't walk into and XP or go for loot just fine, including ToV.  No, I couldn't kill the boss mobs but I could kill just about anything else in the zone.  Now for luclin, besides VT, what didn't I have access to?  You are just blowin smoke now.  What the fuck couldn't I do or see in either of the zones that is even remotely comparible to the shit going on in PoP and later expantions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Important? Naw, just a frequent poster. Actually Glatius, Haass, etc. are also frequent posters and make meaningful posts.... sometimes hehe.<br />
<br />
IF y'all could stop arguing the unlikely, then it might be possible to have an actual discusion.<br />
<br />
The stupid flags exist as timesinks so 20 guilds don't hit the same content at exactly the same time and half of them burn through a new expansion in two weeks.<br />
<br />
I supposed exactly the same thing could be achieved by putting a gatekeeper mob at the entrance of every zone. Want to see Kod'Taz? No problem - here comes Quarm's cousin to see if you are &quot;worthy&quot;.<br />
<br />
SoE has provided some single group content in every expansion. The trouble is that they can't really go all the way down to level 1 or even level 65 but 5K HP's in every single expansion.<br />
<br />
EVERYBODY is level 65 now. Being 65 means nothing. We used to gain less than 500HP's per level. Using that as a standard, a level 65 with 5k HP's is 10 whole levels behind a level 65 with 10K HP's. The &quot;problem&quot; is you grind out those levels by doing LDoN and getting armor and augments or completing previous content - experiance grinding will not get you those missing HP's.<br />
<br />
Level 70 will certainly change all this. Some older content will become trivial. BUT &lt;cackles madly&gt; players will have to fight blue mobs to get experiance. No more LDoN easy experiance, ME, PoD, CoD, etc. Time to step up and fight mobs that hit for 900's minimum.<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure a new LDoN armor set will be made available too.<br />
<br />
I think OoW and level 70 is going to re-energize the game in important ways. Those players wanting to progress will have 5 levels of progression in front of them. Those wanting to sit back or unable to play much will be at the level and doing the content that they have been able to attain.<br />

Dude, just think of all the mobs in ToV that we couldn't kill back in the day.  There was Vulak, there was Vyemm, there was Roy, there was Koi, there was Eashan...and oh, shit, Apolyon's outta fingers.  Well, I dunno how many mobs there were, but it was obviously a lot.</div></div><hr />

Did we have a helluva time?  Yup.  Fuckin Haass had just hit 55, and without defensive, we couldn't take down a veteran.  Were we able to do it? Yes.  Hell, you know what, we were doing it LONG before it became common to do it with one group.  In fact, we were told several times that because we didn't have a raid force, we weren't camping it, and fucksticks like yourself barged in and stole our fucking camp.<br />
<br />
Am I able to go try to get Raex pieces?  No.  Why? Because I haven't killed Rallos zek with the Zerg force.  Explain to me how it's different, and then explain to me WHY IT'S DIFFERENT YOU FUCKING MONGOLOID.<br />

I understand this and it is fine, but why are zones that a single group can get great XP in and upgrade drops off yard trash locked behind a mob that takes a raid to take down.  A raid should unlock another Raid zone, not a zone full of great single group stuff and 1 or 2 mobs that require a raid force.</div></div><hr />

Because those zones happen to contain raid mobs and EP gods ... not to mention it's a bonus perk for actually progressing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">As old as PoP is now, there is no reason not to open up the elemental zones so players can finally stop buying ornate molds from yantis and his gang of hoods.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Time to try rational thinking.  Here, i'll do it for you since you're failling.<br />
<br />
When I was in Kael, there is nothing standing between me and the armor except the mobs.<br />
<br />
Aarynor didn't concern me, because he wasn't standing between me and anything that I could obtain.<br />
<br />
Now I quit during PoP.  Logic would indicate that I had reached as far as I could go in PoP.  Can I do the EP&quot;s?  Absolutely I could, I guarantee I could.  Would I be doing them quickly, would I be farming up guildloads of gear in a nite?  Of course not, but I'd be progressing.<br />
<br />
What stands between me and mobs that I can kill in PoP?  Here's a clue...it's Rallos Zek, and a raid encounter shutting me out of a zone that I could be successful in is a crock of shit.<br />
<br />
Why am I still here?  Because if SoE pulls their head out of their ass and realizes that they fucked up, they might actually get my money again.  I enjoyed EQ, but I'm not gonna pay to slam my dick in their door repeatedly.  If you enjoy that, fine, I'm happy for you, but I'm not gonna deal with that crap while I'm paying them money.</div></div><hr />

Dude, seriously, why are you still posting?  You are just ignoring valid arguments now and trying to be a dick.  The &quot;perk&quot; for raiding is getting that 200HP+ peice of loot that only drops off that raid mob.  If I beat a raid boss that dropped a 300HP BP and it gave me access to a plain where I could farm those 300HP BPs, then I would understand it being locked.  But that isn't how it works, it gives you access to a zone where yard trash is pretty much roundly ignored by uber guilders other then for alt twinking and selling.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Can't get Ssra or VT?  Here's some alternative I can think of off my hand for the 'casual' player<br />
<br />
LDoN Hard (use pet and be willing to take losses to compensate for lack of gear)<br />
<br />
LDoN Normal and buy gear in Takish (slow but safe, and you need xp anyway, even if it's not the best)<br />
<br />
Farm Ornate in BoT.<br />
<br />
Farm Ornate in Sol Ro (public raids, at least on my server, could get you the flags you need).<br />
<br />
Do GoD Sewers expedition (slow but another choice, plus can get spells).<br />
<br />
Do Vxed (very easy, just have a pet hasted and dual wield.  One of these times your charm will last long enough for you to knock out named that drops 100 hp+ items.  And yes you'll be wiping a lot, but it's worth it if you want an easy way to progress in terms of gear).  <br />
<br />
Kill rare named in various early GoD zones that drop items from about 60-90ish HPs<br />
<br />
Do the poison part in BiC for an easy 100 hp neck (all poison parts are easy to get, just long farms).<br />
<br />
Use the aforementioned poison parts to knock out Ikaav for an easy 2 100hp+ loot (basically turns the fight into 3 fights against a yellow con that hits for about 1200 and slowable, with no limit on how many you can bring).<br />
<br />
Do the Riwwi quest and fight through the 8th battle, then stop (Slayer and 10th battle may be too hard for casuals, but first 8 is certainly winnable) for a 128 hp belt/neck.  Very time consuming yes to get keys but you can do it as part of xp grind.  As an aside some of the stuff you kill along the way drops loot too (Night Watchman and Officator).<br />
<br />
Some of these methods may be harder than others but none of them is harder than getting 30 or 50 or whatever you need now to kill Emperor Ssraeshza or the time it'd take to farm 10 shards for VT (not to mention you have nothing to show for shard camps).  Now of course VT/Ssra has loot in greater quantity, but you can't win them all.</div></div><hr />

I understand keys being a needed thing on expantion launch, but cant they just make up some bullcrap about the blockage to the elemental planes has become weak because of the number of people that have passed thru it, no reason not to allow people in elementals if they can kill the trash there as i think it is only fair when you base all AA costs off those 4 zones(and sol ro tower) since the only damn thing left to do is AA grind your ass off and hope for a winning roll agenst that loot whore you are stuck with.</div></div><hr />

Having the &quot;non raiders&quot; threatens their fucking &quot;e-penix&quot; and it also threatens their cash supply.

Solro is locked just as tactics is locked ... just as every single PoP zone other than tier 1 garbage in PoP. Sony caved, though, and opened all pre-EP zones except HoHb, Tactics, and Solro simply because you are supposed to earn them.<br />
<br />
I CAN clear some of the weaker trash mobs in Time ... does this mean i should have time access?? No.  There are enough xp zones and viable exploration sites for non-raiders/progressors including all of Tier3 PoP and riwwi/barindu/ferubi ... not to mention GoD trials.  Guess what ... GoD trial xp is better than EP xp, and most of the loot that drops there is better than any trash which drops off non raid named in EP.  All of this stuff is accessible to you with no pre-requisites, but you still retain this lust for the EP's.<br />
<br />
On a side note, i find it funny that so many people bitch about PoP content being locked and &quot;not geting to see stuff they pay for&quot; when they didnt ever bother to &quot;see&quot; the stuff in previous content.  Gerick, had you taken the time to &quot;see&quot; ST and &quot;see&quot; Emp SSra and &quot;see&quot; Aten ha Ra ... then geting to &quot;see&quot; Solro/Ep would be rather easy as it would be the next logical step.  Instead, you have leveled your ass slowly to 65, purchased a smattering of baz gear and maybe a handful of ornate (bought or otherwise) ... maybe even killed a few BoT towers ... only to expect the rest of the game to be given to you.  Play the game and enjoy it.  You will never catch the carrot, so you might as well enjoy the chase.<br />

Haas, Bourbon and Gerick ... i do believe the original poster would have lumped you under the &quot;whiney bitches&quot; category.  Just because there are 3 of you doesnt make you right.

No, the zone is your reward, as well as everything in it.  By killing the previous bosses you now have a train-free xp playground with neato perks.  These zones are primarily raid zones, though, with many many named and events.  If you ever take the time to earn your way there you will realize this immediately.<br />
<br />
First and foremost ... i'll reitterate that these are raid zones.  There are a few xp spots ... but the focus is raiding.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sure there are plenty of xp zones, but lets be honest why should we have half the XP rate you do? why should the uber get even more powerful and always have the lead?<br />
<br />
The thing is the first people to beat and farm the content have it easyest, no one to contend with, no one to beat you to the raid, no one farming the content ahead of you for awhile, all of us who didnt get to 7k before now are probibly going to stay under 7k, burried under mounds of trash and old content no one wants to do anymore.<br />

Dont call me lazy shit head, i have scrapped around for everyp upgrade i can, i do whatever i think i can acomplish but i fucking refuse to leave the guild i have had 3 characters grow old in, 3 and a half year membership and officership go to waste just so i can see some fucking god in time and wave my dick at it before everyone else.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Well, worth discussing I suppose. After the effort necessary to get to Plane of Earth, I felt I &quot;earned&quot; the priviledge of exping in a zone not overrun by players training the entrance, a nice ZEM, and where the components for Steel Ring of Earthen Resistance, and Stonewood Compound Bow dropped to groups. There was a sense of accomplishment and a tangible reward for that accomplishment.<br />
<br />
I believe the 1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th guild to reach PoEarth on my server felt exactly the same way. I suspect the 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12th guilds will feel the same in a month or two.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">&quot;There are enough xp zones&quot;<br />
<br />
Sure there are plenty of xp zones, but lets be honest why should we have half the XP rate you do? why should the uber get even more powerful and always have the lead?<br />
<br />
The thing is the first people to beat and farm the content have it easyest, no one to contend with, no one to beat you to the raid, no one farming the content ahead of you for awhile, all of us who didnt get to 7k before now are probibly going to stay under 7k, burried under mounds of trash and old content no one wants to do anymore.<br />
<br />
When all the casuals quit i hope you dont mind paying more for your acount, because i am getting sick of supporting your high horse and the mound of shit on top of it apo.<br />
<br />
First and foremost the uber get uberer faster simply because they play more and work harder than you do.  Secondly, GoD trials vxed/tipt and all sewers have BETTER XP and BETTER LOOT than trash in EPs ... and some of the loot rivals raid quality loot.  All of this is already open to you, but i doubt you can access it as at 5k unbuffed you will get anally raped by trash mobs in these zones.  Progress a bit and visit them when you are ready.<br />
<br />
And gerick you STILL arent listening, because you can get to over 7k unbuffed without raiding at all.  I started in April and i'm there already.  Just work at it ffs and quit whining.</div></div><hr />

I've tanked all 4 towers more than once in pick up raids, blizzard twice, i have been on 15 xanamech raids and lead several of them myself only to see the hammer drop twice and someone else wins it(and I even tank on those sometimes), I've tanked carp when no 6k+ warriors could take the time to lend a hand.

This still doesnt change the fact that you havent seen all of velious or luclin yet complain about not seeing EP's.  I've tanked all 4 towers over a dozen times each ... i've tanked xanameck 4-5 times before i got bored of it.  I've personally MT'd every single mob pre-EP at least once, though most 3+ times.  I've worked damn hard at earning my gear, and only 3 pieces i currently wear are raid gear.  The rest comes from<br />
<br />
Guess what .. my guild isnt in EP's yet.  Thats right, i worked extra hard and took the initiative to flag all by my one-sies.  Thankfully we have all caught up and are about to down RZ for the first time as a guild.<br />
<br />
Don't cry to me, as you will see 0 sympathy.  The amount of time you have invested in progressing yourself doesnt even begin to measure up with a lot of hardcore players (and no, i dont consider myself a hardcore raider).<br />

On a side note: I'm the MT and raid leader for my guild.  I'm an officer and have been such since the guild's inception.  Through my own sweat and blood (and the others who helped start this guild) we built a guild from the ground up ... slowly progressing through Luclin and Early PoP since September of last year when our old guild folded.  We slowly grew from Luclin mini named and BoT towers up through Tier 1-3 PoP bosses over the course of 10 fucking months.  <br />

You have a lot of presuppositions about me, sir.  You are 100% wrong if you think being in a guild and progressing is as simple as making an assist key and not drawing attention to myself.<br />

Gerick if you really wanted to 7500 hps is not all that hard to reach and you could do it in under a month or 2 if you work hard.  Just spend time in Hard ldon, GoD, and Solro.  I would really stress hard ldon though as you get loot, points, and good xp all at the same time.  Once you get some beef on you head to GoD for augments and trial loot.  <br />

<br />
Don't wait to be invited .. build your own groups with clerics you know are damn good and that you trust.  If your team is good and your aggro is strong you'll win the ldons.<br />
<br />
I wont lie to you and tell you it was easy, i had to dig in my fingernails and claw my way inch by inch from 5-7k hps unbuffed.  It seems impossible to do, but if you take your time and work at it slowly (40hp augs and 10ac augs help a lot) then you will get there eventually.  Once you hit around 6k unbuffed hps then you can start to cakewalk hard ldon and start working on GoD trials (wait for 6.5 for tipt/vxed).<br />
<br />
LDoN easies are still good things to do.  50 points per adv isnt bad, and named loot there can sell decently and be used to purchase buyable upgrades.... or turn them in for tribute.  I run 150hps for 21 pts per 10 mins all the time, and it isnt all that hard to do.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">One thing this thread has accomplished, is to make me really glad I've stopped playing EQ altogether.  I don't like the perspective of many of the people still playing the game.  I don't care for their attitudes.  And I think any game that is expanded upon further to accommodate their egos and give them validation strokes as being superior human beings because they happen to band together in a large group and have a few half way knowledgable leaders can't but suck serious ass.<br />
<br />
You're not a better person because you join a raiding guild.  You're not a superior player because you join a raiding guild.  You're just another Joe player like every other Joe player, except you have choosen a different playing style.  And for some reason you feel that playing style not only makes you deserving of better progression within the game, it also makes you deserving of significantly more content.  You'll continually point to the small bones tossed to the non-raiders here and there as evidence of everything being fair and equitable while you not only gear yourselves in three times as good of gear, keep zones strictly to yourselves for no other reason than you feel you deserve it, but you'll also look down on anyone who doesn't happen to play the game the same way you do.  If this description doesn't apply to you, then it's not for you it's intended.<br />
<br />
At this point, I don't just think the game is messed up, I'm pretty well convinced that at least a portion of the player base is as well.  Good luck with your ego trips.  Good luck with your uber leet attitudes.  And we'll all just sit back and watch the subscription levels over the next six months and we'll see who's more correct in the end.</div></div><hr />

 I've done it a number of times. There's nothing &quot;laborous&quot; about invising, killing a couple mobs, reinvising and moving, or nothing that a &quot;real casual' group can't do <br />
<br />
You see here is the root of your arrogance that winds throughout this argument.  YOU can do this because you are well geared (being able invis in and stop at see invis and kill them rapidly enough to not get pat adds).  Most NON TIME NON ELEMENTAL geared just cant do things the way you can.  There is simply to much risk of a wipe (wipe meaning a royal pain in the ass)...again and I'm going to use caps just so you might actually read this IT DOESNT MATTER WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH YOUR ELITE TOON IT MATTERS WHAT A NORMAL CASUAL PERSON CAN DO . <br />
<br />
Take a group of 65s with few aas and bazaar gear (casuals) and do it your way and the you'll die...try it before you go wising off again.<br />
<br />
You also seem confused on another point...I'm not a casual.  At this point I'm a guy who plays alot every night actually trying to do less with more.  The reason I'm championing the casual in this thread is I run into alot of them these days.  They are no lazy or whiney.  <br />

Scroll back up plz Flair and you will read where i pointed out that a select few pieces of my gear were &quot;raid loots&quot;. <br />
<br />
Now, take some of my weaker plate spots and replace them with completely aug'd Takish pieces ... replace my dain ring with the mistmoore 100hp ring, and replace my 100hp shoulders with the 85hp shoulders that come of of mistmooore.  Do all these changes and you will see that yeah breaking 7k without any raiding isnt hard to do.  It just times time and effort which 90% of the playerbase doesnt want to spend the time to do.<br />
<br />
And yes, we have 1 grouped seru.  It really isnt hard to do at all.  And no, we didnt have EP gear or even EP flags when we did it.  We did have it either when we farmed the hell out of Hard LDoN or GoD trials.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">Several aspects of this thread are of interest to me.<br />
<br />
1. Length: this topic is of considerable interest to the community, clearly.<br />
<br />
2. People I respect and am certain are highly skilled disagree on certain elements of this topic. Battleblade and Haass appear to hold different views on some key points (though not all), for example. <br />
<br />
3. There really is a huge range of power now among lvl 65 warriors, a fact that has significantly exacerbated disagreements in this thread given that it is also coupled with a complete lack of definition of what constutes &quot;casual.&quot; Several posters here have indicated that zones that are the rough equivalent to LDoN-hards and the named at the end of them are &quot;easy.&quot; Indeed they are if you have 9K hitpoints 250 AAs 400 days played and a group of equivalently-geared friends. Indeed they are not if you have 1350 AC. <br />
<br />
<br />
4. Many arguments here basically run like this: &quot;You could do this content with one group if you had the skill to do it and until you do this content you have to admit you are lazy and want everything handed to you. I this stuff all the time.&quot; Even assuming for a moment that not all these arguments are being made by people whose real goal is to claim they have much bigger dicks than everyone else, such arguments, in many cases, look as if they are saying that a casual player could advance his character with a single group if he put so much time into the game that he were no longer a casual player. <br />
Indeed, some of the stuff suggested as advancement paths for casual players would take much much less time to achieve if the player simply joined a raiding guild--and, presumably in many cases (though not all) casual players don't have the kind of time necessary to put into a raiding guild. How exactly are they going to find even more time to put into advancing with a single group?<br />
<br />
5. There is a consistant underestimation of the difficulty faced by casual players in retaining over time small groups of skilled fellow players to attack challenging single-group content. All characters in such a group would have to progress at the same rate, be online at the same time, and be available (not already in another group) when the sixth man logs on. The more casual the players, the less likely they will remain in the same place in terms of content, and the less likely it is that they will all be on at the same time/day, and the less likely they will be able to stay together over time. <br />
<br />
6.  Everyone skips some content to do other content. Raiders do it, casuals do it, even the bees do it. Saying that a casual player has no complaint if he hasn't done every zone that he could possibly do before he does the one he'd like to do is not a particularly strong argument. All but a handful of warriors in the game could &quot;advance&quot; their characters and see &quot;new&quot; content by becoming 1750 tradeskillers too. So I guess none of us -- not raiders and not casuals -- should complain about anything until we exhaust that possibility? I don't think so, and you don't think so either.<br />
<br />
7. There is a big difference between demonstrating these two things:<br />
A. I have a bigger dick than everyone else.<br />
B. I am a bigger dick than everyone else.<br />
Apparently it is orders of magnitude easier to demonstrate B than A.</div></div><hr />

His primary magelo is comprised of mostly LDoN with piece or 2 from GoD vxed (open to anyone).  Everything there is one groupable.  Everything there not from LDoN is trivial with the addition of another group.  Go to his alternat profile and you'll see what happens when you use that new-found gear base to 1group even more stuff including Kod`Taz random named and even Seru.  Breaking 7k is doable ... getting to 7500 is not impossible with 0 raid gear.<br />
<br />
None of these magelo's include any of the neato 20-35hp augs you can find in GoD off 1 groupable content.  If i filled all the gaps with even more 1groupable content you could add another 300hps and a lot more ac ...<br />

<br />
Such is the life of a level 65 person who doesnt raid.  1000+ people server-wide have done exactly what you just said is silly ... taken the initiative via ldon.  I personally did not do this as most of my gear is not LDoN purchased.  I have maybe 10k points total spent btw 40hp and 10ac augs ... and a few anger3's and a yak aug.  The rest of my gear was picked up along the way here and there slowly patching it together with a bit of spit-shine.<br />
<br />
Raiding doesnt put loot in your hands quickly Gerick.  I've spent around 250 hours of raiding for the 4 pieces of raid loot i have.  Most raiders see a single upgrade every month to month and a half in a casual guild, and maybe 1 loot per 2 weeks-1 month in a hardcore guild on average.<br />
<br />
250 hours translates to 12500 LDoN points running easies at 1 hour per mission ... at 45 mintues per mission youre looking at close to 20k LDoN points for the time i have invested raiding.  Run Hards versus normals at regular time and youre looking at close to 30k LDoN points. 20k LDoN points is enough to fully deck out a toon in Takish buyables + all the augments that go along with it.... not to mention the charm upgrades you get for completeing each camp .. an extra 100hp/mana and stats/saves to boot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">Personally, though, i think you're only cheating yourself out by choosing not to raid with a guild.  Unless your server has massively organized pickup raids (ours does), the most exciting and fun content in the game is found raiding.  The same is true with the coolest looking places imo.<br />

Single grouping is fun to do, but gets very old rather quickly for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">Sleepers was perma farmed on Stromm awhile with coth bot armies not sure if thats still happening.We ran into the same problems finding mobs up /shrug.So this week and the next couple you don't get the raid mob you want you will eventually,just hit other stuff until then it's what we did.The requirements for ep access have been there awhile and we all had to get through them.Everyone should have to play by the same rules imo.GOD xp is faster and more fun for me with better droppable loot.Mobs in the GOD I've seen  range from like normal LDON mobs in some sewers to Tipt freaks better tanked by pets.Though I like tanking them withut pets just to give my friend clerics a workout hehe.There are some trash drop upgrades in ep,but, nothing that will turn your magelo.EP molds of course don't drop off of trash.It'll be a while until the uberest  people have a hope in heck of 1 grouping mold droppers.At the moment ep is often a rat race raid zone with guilds tearing through them has targets of opportunity pop.They have to farm these mobs consistently to be able to drop the next set of pop flag mobs that block access to the plane of time.<br />
<br />
I think POP with POK books immense jumps in gear power(and raid mob power) pas a victem of the bigger is better syndrome thingy.Raids are tougher and require more tactics and skill from individuals in the raid force.Some of the mobs are pretty kewl looking and have interesting points to them that just seem like hell the first time you bump heads with them.By ramping stuff up this way they forced players to utilize larger raid forces and created some obvious shelves of gearing strength.Everyone else had to get their flags and imo everyone should still thats fair.<br />
<br />
God actually seems more fun to play in,although harder cr's and unknown quantities probably turn people off.POP zones and especially LDON imo led people to expect stuff spoon fed to them so anything that requires more time and risk seems like a bad deal.With xp group bonuses now( the thing that pissed me off really...why would 6 people killing a mob easily, get the same experience as me and my wife heh - of  course this has nothing to do with what it would drop)people hit 65 with much less effort and the challenge has gone from it relatively speaking.They need to refocus the adventure game be it 1 group ,or duo,trio whatever so people have stuff to explore and gain decent xp and relative strength loot without the benefit of the perfect raid or group.Requiring a pet for tipt imo is ridiculous.Wth charm is getting outa hand hehe.<br />
<br />
I imagine that level 70 will allow alot of warriors who presently feel &quot;capped&quot; to more safely explore GOD and whatever else pops up.Lots of good upgrades there.Though upgrades should try to reflect the power of the mob or quest that drop them.</div></div><hr />

I am sorry I have never seen a game that you can go same places that the top end could, and even if could go to some would be suicide. I am in a family/raid guild that has people wanting to join every day, we have had to basically close recruiting except for 3 classes atm, why do they come? they enjoy raiding they want to raid every day if we would. On FFA(free for all) days our guild population is very small. Basically can say left and right people want to have stuff to do 1 group but thats not what Ive seen from my eyes.</div></div><hr />

Good luck with your ego trips.  Good luck with your uber leet attitudes.  And we'll all just sit back and watch the subscription levels over the next six months and we'll see who's more correct in the end.<br />

Yeah sure, especialy since in 6 months EQ2 and WoW will have been released, i don't think you'll make any point. No need to be Sherlock Holmes to see to see it will have a very noticeable impact on EQ playerbase.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">I don't know if it is right that XP zones are locked from people who don't raid.  But it's wrong to characterize this as a recent problem.<br />
<br />
Kunark: froglok forager/hunter were harder than the XP mobs in Sebilis.  Trakanon was harder than half of the dragons in VP.  The only source of epic-class weapons prior to epic quests was locked away in VP.  The best XP zone in Kunark (HS) was locked, and the key mobs were arguably raid targets for those in the starting level range for HS (level 45).<br />
<br />
Velious: yes, the armor quest zones were open, but: the ST dragons were far tougher than the mobs in ST.  Better-than-epic weapons were locked away in ST, where they were one-group-farmable.  The best XP spot in Velious (POM), containing the best armor quests in Velious for 8 classes (which could be worked on by small groups), was &quot;locked&quot; deep in NTOV.<br />
<br />
Luclin: not going to touch this one since Luclin was so messed up (Inner Acrylia, broken quests, etc.)<br />
<br />
POP: originally POP was brutally locked up, true.  Then the &quot;ornate zones&quot; were opened up and things changed somewhat for the better.  I still wish that there was a long quest to obtain SolRo access (e.g. if you complete every other alternate access quest yourself, then I think you deserve to gain SolRo entry).  I don't know what the answer to EP's is.  They are much like ST in early Velious, or Sebilis in early Kunark, neither of which were ever opened up.  Mudflation eventually takes care of most barriers to most zones.</div></div><hr />

I guess that's a pretty central difference.<br />
<br />
I'm currently working on an 1150 AP 20HP/20Mana/20End aug which, after moving some augments around, will allow me to retire a Perfect Garnet of Constitution with 12HP's. That's a 8HP/20End net gain from 1150 AP's.<br />
<br />
I am in fact working on my trade skills and have accumulated 20 Buckets of Crab Legs. Being able to make Bristlebane's Party Platters instead of using Tormentor Stir Fry nets me a few HP's.<br />
<br />
Finally, I'm looking at fixing my Dain faction (I'm currently Scowls) one Velium piece at a time so I can upgrade my 8th ring to a 10th ring. 10 Regen and 2+ DS more is a powerful motivation.<br />
<br />
EverQuest is a game of accumlated small advanteges which are often obtained at a cost of a lot of time of effort. This is particularly true of Warriors - we don't generally get new &quot;spells&quot; or abilities that increase our power.<br />
<br />
Replace that Vindi BP with a Kizrak's Chestplate of Battle and you won't notice much difference. Replace all of your FH armor as well with Kizrak or Raex and the difference begins to accumulate and mean something.<br />
<br />
To be honest, I believe most of the &quot;casual&quot; and small raid posters on this thread are being a little dishonest - a path is there. The truth is, however, given their playstyle it's extremely steep and progress glacially slow. They believe under those circumstances, the path might as well not exist.<br />
<br />
***<br />
In the past, I (and others) have advocated allowing selling back LDoN AP items - it's happened. I've suggested increasing the AP's for a successfully completed LDoN adventure. I'm certainly not against non-progression &quot;solo&quot; quests to open up individual access to ToSoRo and even the EP's.<br />
<br />
On another thread things like 18 member instanced encounters (including Medium difficulty LDoN 18-person raids) have been suggested as has insuring that every class is able to meaningfully solo. I've suggested restoring the Fabled mobs to make old content meaningful again and provide some not quite high-level raid items primarily for players that don't raid 7 days a week.<br />
***<br />
<br />
See all the suggestions between the &quot;*'s&quot;? Please kindly explain to me WHY these aren't the kinds of things casual players are clamoring for and why SoE isn't listening.<br />
<br />
Don't think for one minute that &quot;ubah&quot; players aren't sympathetic with many of the complaints of casual players. Almost all of the things suggested above improves the game for us as well.<br />
<br />
I think there's a happy medium between the kind of massive timesinks a &quot;hard-core&quot; player will tolerate and the (from my point of view) instant gratification some casual players seem to be advocating.<br />

This shows a basic lack of understanding of how MMORPGs work.  They are games, yes.  But to keep people playing them there needs to always be a carrot dangling in front of you just out of reach.  The time required to get that carrot is significant because if it wasn't you'd get all the carrots and then there'd be nothing to do so you'd quit.  The time spent doing this is supposed to be fun.  If it's not then you're probably playing the wrong game.<br />
<br />
Raid gear takes significantly more time per piece to get than LDON gear.  This is balanced by the fact that the gear you do eventually get raiding is superior.  Gear tends to come in spurts for raiders.  My guild raids 4 days a week.  You know how many pieces of loot I got in the last 6 months?  With the exception of the last 2 weeks, One.  4 days a week x 26 weeks x about 5 hours a day = 520 hours for 1 piece of loot.  Why the long gap?  I already had all my EP armor and we were farming gear for the rest of our members and flagging people for time and KT.<br />
<br />
In the last 2 weeks we've gotten our first 2 Quarm kills and started chugging through the Ikkinz raid trials and I picked up 5 pieces of armor, 1 weapon, and a 4 damage weapon augment.  I'll be a loot sponge for another month probably and then I won't get much for another 3-6 months again while we gear everyone else up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">Raid gear takes significantly more time per piece to get than LDON gear.<br />
<br />
This is a false assumption.  It's not true.  Raid gear comes significantly faster than LDoN gear, or raiders would spend all their time gearing up in LDoN before raiding, yet we know they don't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">72 man raid ... 2 pieces of loot per hour average assuming lots of targets are up (and we all know they arent always) .... (Talking PoP here).<br />
<br />
youre looking at 32 hours invested on average per piece of loot.  This time decreases if you work with a smaller raid force ... down to 25 hours if you only raid with 50ish people.  <br />
<br />
Now you might say &quot;hot damn thats an EP loot item per 25 hours invested!! Wow!!!&quot;.  Think about this: In order to access this gear raiding, you have to spend a fuckton of hours raiding ... raiding more ... backflagging .... all of this before your guild can even start to raid this.  That, sir, is a metric fuckton of time spent for your EP loots.  Especially if you have walked your guild all the way through velious and Luclin as i know most all of the Highend raiders have.<br />
<br />
LDoN gear fully augmented rivals weak EP gear and can be gotten with simple time invested.  You dont have to make plans around it ... You dont have to miss things in RL to do it ... You dont even have to run with a dedicated crew or make any friends.  In the long run, a person can get to EP quality gear much much faster by being a lone wolf and earning the gear on their own.<br />
<br />
7k unbuffed is about as much as the best tanks had first entering EP's when PoP came out.... but now an average shmuck like me can waltz into EP's with single groupable and small raid gear and tank everything from Pyronis to Reparm in fire ... Hydrotha and Mr wise ... Avatar of Mist/Smoke/Dust ... Tant yadda yadda.<br />
<br />
Once you get into the full swing of things gear flows faster and at a higher quality than non-raiding can ever dream of, but in order to get there you have to invest twice the time and sell a large chunk of your soul.  The argument doesnt really hold water Glat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">Yes, we know all that.  And you're still wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u70"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p70">LDoN introduced a never before seen ability to see Rad Quality gear without raiding at all.  Without LDoN and GoD, breaking into the EP's and PoP progression would be practically impossible without first spending enourmous amts of time in SSRA and VT to gear up.  <br />
<br />
My guild killed HP once in SSra and XTC once ...  that is the most we have ever seen of Luclin, but yet we are still about to tackle RZ and waltz into EP's on the backs of our random LDoN gear and augments.<br />
<br />
So ... complaining that it takes you 50 hours per piece of almost EP quality armor that can last you all the way till time is completely fucked up.  If you dont want to spend the time you dont have to, but at least dont whine about it.</div></div><hr />

1. 50 points per win.<br />
<br />
a) 50 points because hard capable groups in a pickup setting are very hard to come by.<br />
<br />
b) 50 points because many groups will not use a tank under an arbitrary ammount of hitpoints.<br />
<br />
c) 50 points not because I'm unwilling to try hard, but because I have limited play time, 50 points on a success &gt; potential fail on hard. Failing a hard is very likely with gear that would be upgraded by LDoN.<br />
<br />
2. 2 hours minimum from start to finish, including setup.<br />
<br />
a) 2 hours because pickup groups take forever to form.<br />
<br />
b) 2 hours because there is a very real chance that someone will die even on easy.<br />
<br />
c) 2 hours because someone will want to leave after this one is over.<br />
<br />
d) 2 hours because it takes us gimps nearly an hour and a half to finish.<br />
<br />
3. 20 hours a week including weekends.<br />
<br />
a) 20 hours because of RL constraints.<br />
<br />
b) 20 hours because of guild events, epic hits, *gasp* Kael arena raids, rumblecrush wiping us 3 times before we get him down.<br />
<br />
c) 20 hours because that doesn't include helping guildies.<br />
<br />
d) 20 hours because my english comp professor loves to assign long ass research projects. (Why, oh, why do they do that...)<br />
<br />
50 / 2 = 25 points an hour x 20 hours a week = 500 points per week<br />
<br />
Thats roughly 40 hours per piece from LDoN and thats not including failures. This is still for subpar equipment. You still have to augment it to start seeing the real benefits.<br />
<br />
So, hmm, lets see...<br />
<br />
If I was a raider, I'd see what maybe 1 piece a month in upgrades? Ok, and thats for gear thats better than my LDON gear that I spent 120 hours on to buy and augment? So assuming, the same ammount of time spent on raiding. I have to work 1.5 times longer than a raider to get the best attainable gear I can get, which is still very much inferior to raid gear.<br />
<br />
I can accept that raids provide better gear than groupable content. I however, find it a little hard to believe you expect me to spend 50% more time to get that lesser gear.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm not gonna go ito this whole othe debate that has been going on in this thread. Gerick and I seem to see eye to eye on this one, so I figured I chime in with what I thought he was talking about.<br />
<br />
I'm not complaining per se, because i'm not quite there yet to fully see the problem. I can however see if approaching. My main concern is that non-raiders are not only expected to have inferior gear (thats fine, thats how the devs said it will be) but to also work harder for their inferior gear.<br />
<br />
This doesn't include having to compete with raiders for group spots. I was going to say something about bottom-feeding, but I think its been beat over the head enough. I will say that it is difficult for a family guild such as mine to find raid targets up on my server, I can't speak about other servers, just mine. Whether thats cock-blocking/botom-feeding or not, I don't know.</div></div><hr />

Raiders also have the added perk of access to the highest ZEM zones in the game, fairly competition free. Being able to farm augments in GoD. Most have even setup a point system in which to earn new gear drop on raids via DKP.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying non-raiders don't have it easier that its been in the past, they cahnges have been nice. the sell back feature makes LDoN the progressive quest it should have been in the first place.<br />
<br />
I only have one significant point to make and that is if raiders have to work so much harder for tehor gear and xp, then why is it the preferred progression path. Why has raiding taken such a drastic change in focus in the game from where it was upon release. I'd say that it was indicative of how hard it is to be a raider vs non-raider. People usually tend toward the path of least resistance, same as electricity.<br />
<br />
Maybe raiders know, somewhere in the back of thier mind, that their big machine depends on EQ providing the easier path to gear compared to non-raiders. Without the raid loot carrot being closer at hand than the non-raid loot carrot, the big guilds would crumble or at the very least depend on people that actually like being the one o the first to beat cutting edge content, and not just be there to roll on the Phat l33ts.</div></div><hr />

Hi, I'm a raider who raids 10 hours/week and does non-raiding 10 hours/week.  Here's the raid loot I received in the last 1.5 years (all from the same guild).  Does this look to you like a faster rate of equipment progression than LDON @ 500 pts/week?<br />
<br />
1/03 - Mask of Superiority (Lendiniara)<br />
2/03 - Cord Hilted Spiked Driver (Zanamech)<br />
3/03 - Primal bow (Zeixshi-Kar)<br />
4/03 - Greaves of the Deep Sea (Koi'Doken)<br />
5/03 - Great Blade of Storms (Eindride)<br />
6/03 - Ornate breastplate (Eindride)<br />
7/03 - Gauntlets of Dragon Slaying (Yelinak)<br />
8/03 - Greatstaff of the Four Winds (Auliffe)<br />
10/03 - Belt of Dwarf Slaying (Dain)<br />
11/03 - Guard Captain's Faceguard (Maidens)<br />
12/03 - Rotting Fist (Bertox)<br />
1/04 - Black Basalt Band (Jiva)<br />
2/04 - Helmet of Rallos Zek (AoW)<br />
3/04 - Crystallized Rain (Agnarr)<br />
4/04 - Rotting weapons that nobody wanted: Sparkling Shortsword, Obsidian Greatblade (EPs)<br />
5/04 - Raex's Bracer (PoAir)<br />
5/04 - Ensorcelled Metalcloth Cape (PoAir)<br />
<br />
Just for comparison, here's what I obtained by myself in the same time frame, without raiding, just by XPing in places where loot drops, or obtaining materials to make stuff:<br />
<br />
12/02 - Valorium Ring x2<br />
3/03 - Bloodmetal Earring x2<br />
4/03 - Ornate Hat, Boots<br />
4/03 - Amygdalan Chain Mask<br />
5/03 - Ornate Bracer<br />
6/03 - Heavy Rubicite Belt<br />
6/03 - Ornate Greaves, Gloves<br />
7/03 - Ornate Arms<br />
8/03 - Stonewood Compound Bow<br />
9/03 - Crinose Cape of Werewolf<br />
11/03 - Marble Sphere of Disgust<br />
11/03 - Preserved Flesh Mantle<br />
12/03 - Royal Attendant Bracer, Glowing Sapphire of Courage<br />

No, my theory is that Vikken's &quot;casual player rate&quot; of 500 LDON points per 20-hr week matches the rate that my EP raiding guild obtains gear.<br />

All this is fine Gunnar.  I believe that you and your guild buddies get less experience overall because you commit a significant portion of your time to raiding.  But that still leaves the unvarnished truth that should you decide to devote a greater portion of your time to gaining experience, the zones you can experience in successfully because you have access and appropriate gear reward you with more experience in the same amount of time.  So if you wish to make up for lost experience due to raiding, you certainly have every tool necessary to do that.  Reasonably exclusive content.  Reasonably adequate gear for that content.  And a higher ZEM as a reward.  Plus, those zones usually have some half way desirable loot drops that you may use or you may be able to sell for large amounts of plat.<br />
<br />
The stories that raiders have it harder just aren't true.  In many ways they have it easier, once they've geared up and flagged up.  Prior to that, yes perhaps it's a tough road.  But once the guild machine is in place, once you have a hardcore group of people flagged and geared, then the gear just comes easier and easier.  PoTime is well known for being a pinata of gear.  And that is the big carrot at the end for raiders in PoP.  The big carrot at the end for non-raiders just doesn't exist.</div></div><hr />

For me at least, LDoN loot rate doesn't vary. Risk is 0 and while it's mind-numbing getting something is guaranteed.<br />

I do both. Check my augs. I am however highly motivated to stop doing LDoN. Only maxing out my Adventure Stone and getting one final augment is keeping me there.<br />

Yes the big pinata for casual raiders does exist in multiple places ... the candy inside just isnt gonna have 50ac or 200+ hps on it.  BoT towers are a very nice perk for casuals, as are drops in Tactics out of nice xp camps ... and those very dedicated casuals who solro flag themselves have a trememdous perk in ornate dropping off of all yard trash mobs in the zone.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u96"><b>Khumak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p96">So, the theory here is that raiders invest more time, work harder, get fewer items, and at best about the same experience as a non-raider, but raid solely because they love to raid?   Nice theory.  I'm not buying it as factual though.<br />
<br />
No, raiders raid because they enjoy taking down bosses that require a large, coordinated effort to win and seeing how far and how fast they can break through the most current content before mudflation makes it easy enough for everyone to do it.<br />
<br />
50 / 2 = 25 points an hour x 20 hours a week = 500 points per week<br />
<br />
Thats roughly 40 hours per piece from LDoN and thats not including failures. This is still for subpar equipment. You still have to augment it to start seeing the real benefits.<br />
<br />
So, hmm, lets see...<br />
<br />
If I was a raider, I'd see what maybe 1 piece a month in upgrades? Ok, and thats for gear thats better than my LDON gear that I spent 120 hours on to buy and augment? So assuming, the same ammount of time spent on raiding. I have to work 1.5 times longer than a raider to get the best attainable gear I can get, which is still very much inferior to raid gear.<br />
<br />
<br />
You're trying to portray the worst possible scenario for LDON as the average experience for groups there.  Yes a good raid guild or for that matter even an average raid guild will get loot faster than a group that can just barely win normal LDONs.  If normal LDONs are that hard for you then you may need to buy some starter gear from the bazaar first.  They aren't that hard.<br />
<br />
I've done normal LDONs before with just me and 2 unguilded paladins.  With no buffs other than BSS and clicky haste (30%) it takes about 60 mins.  The pallies may have had KEI as well, I don't remember.  This is a group of 3 people that includes zero DPS classes and zero real healers.  I was the only one of the 3 with decent gear.  I find it hard to believe that even a poorly put together pickup group couldn't match that and I know damned well that a well balanced one would easily surpass it even with crappy gear.  I regularly burn through 4 normal missions every 3 hours with the first 5 people I see with LFG up when I'm trying to get another HP aug or something.<br />
<br />
As you win more of them and aquire more practice doing them and either buy gear from the merchants or use the drops you get your times should improve.  When the normal ones become easy take a shot at the hard ones.  You don't have to win them for them to be worthwhile.  For a casual gamer without raid gear the minibosses drop some damned nice loot that is roughly on par with low end VT raid gear.  This is before being auged.<br />
<br />
I lost a shitload of hard LDONs doing that while me and my friends geared up with VT caliber drops off of the mini named.  Early on we lost about 75% of the hard ones but we didn't care because our goal was the named.  Took about 2 months for a cleric friend of mine in a non raiding guild to get fully decked out in a mix of hard ldon drops and the 1492 pt merchant armor with full augs.  <br />
<br />
At that point you're ready to do the GoD sewer trials and then Vxed and Tipt.  Those trials also contain nice gear upgrades.  When you beat all of those you have access to KT which has low end Plane of Time caliber gear that drops off of trash mobs and 1 groupable named.<br />
<br />
The progression options for casual gamers are out there.  You just have to put the time in to do them.  The more time you're willing to spend, the farther you'll get.  If you can only play 2 hours a week then no, you'll never get anywhere in EQ.  You should be playing something like Diablo which doesn't require large time commitments if that's all you can spare.<br />
<br />
Case in point:  One of our recent warrior apps walked into the guild with around 10.5k hps raid buffed decked out almost entirely in LDON armor.  He's closer to 11k now with a few raid drops but he's tanking in KT, Plane of Time, and Ikkinz raid trials now in mostly single groupable gear.<br />
<br />
Another option for the casual gamer who doesn't like LDON is to just do pickup raids whenever you hear about them.  As each expansion comes out and mudflation makes older content easier, content that used to be exclusive to the raiding guilds becomes open to anyone willing to join a pickup raid.  Our server has pickup raids going on constantly hitting everything up to and including EP mold droppers.  I imagine when OOW comes out we'll start seeing pickup Time raids as well.</div></div><hr />

You actually give a reason in your post abuot why you are where you are. There are many ways to play EQ. Certain ways of play will get you into more zones. <br />
<br />
Based on your post, you make a conscious choice to stay in your current guild, rather than move up to a group of people that might play in such a way to get you to those zones, either quicker or at all. That's actually commendable. As a guild leader, I can't tell you how many times I've watched people bail on our guild to jump to a guild a notch or two above us so they can get the good stuff now, rather than when we get there. Many times, it works out that they just spent all their DKP, or just got a class defining item. <br />
<br />
So far as Haas posts, he just wants access to SEE the zones and be as successful as his play style allows him to be. While I understand the point, and accept it on the surface as not being a bad thing, there are some valid viewpoints as to why some of us wouldn't want the EP opened up. Some have been posted, some haven't. <br />
<br />
EP zone trash mobs in themselves aren't all hard and some are quite easy once you learn them, just like any other zone. One problem is that some of these zones are laggy as piss when you get a raid in them. Imagine trying to raid when you add another half dozen groups into the zone. Would better/more hardware fix this? I don't know as I don't know exactly what kind of hardware they use anyway. <br />
<br />
Some zones have events/rings that constant flooding of xp groups could potentially keep them in a state that they couldn't be triggered or even completed. That would keep raiding guilds or pickup raids from being able to progress and move out of those zones. I would think it would also be hell on local server politics if that did happen.<br />
<br />
Like it or not, guilds that DO raid a lot also gain status and recognition for progressing. Whether you think they are famous or infamous depends on your point of view, but it's part of human nature to compete and this is a form of competition.<br />
<br />
<br />
I think whoever had the idea of zones locking behind you as you get flags or keys to progress had a good idea. I can't imagine SoE would actually do anything so simple that seems on the surface to make so much sense. Make these zones fun AND rewarding for 1 to 2 groups at a time and give people another choice of play style.</div></div><hr />

... this isnt a far cry from &quot;I pay my 13 bucks every month and log in .... i deserve everything&quot;.<br />
<br />
Actually, this is your interpretation of my points. They actually vary slightly from what you think I want.<br />
<br />
1. Everyone should have access to the same xp zones -  Yes, I do.  Why shouldn't they?  Because some people raid means they should have access to exclusive xp content?  Not a very rational reason, since you seem to feel people should be rational.<br />
<br />
2.  Everyone should have access to the same caliber of gear -  No, not really.  I'm perfectly willing to accept that raiding should gain a person better gear.  Where I differ in my opinion versus the current reality is the degree of difference and the fact that, whether or not raiders will admit it, they will gain gear at a significantly faster rate than non-raiders.  The time commitment involved in LDoN is substantially higher than the rewards warrant.<br />
<br />
3.  Joining a raiding guild is the &quot;easy way&quot; - Yes, in some respects it can be.  Unless everyone in the guild has been a member prior to it breaking into places like the elemental planes and PoTime, you've got at least some members who haven't &quot;paid their dues&quot; so to speak.  They ride in on the coat tails of the guild itself and are massively rewarded for just being a warm body.  Please tell me you don't have members who joined your guild in complete and utter crap gear and within a few months weren't outfitted in gear that is at most just a step below that of the best geared in the guild.  It happens all the time.  Claiming it doesn't is blatantly untrue.<br />
<br />
4.  People who invested the time to actually earn shit are pompous pricks -  No, actually I have a lot of respect for people like Frodlin and even, most of the time anyway, Battleblade, who have gone out and earned their uber gear upgrades.  The ones I feel are pompous pricks are the ones like you, who want to beat their chests about how superior they are because their guilds have managed to gain them some pretty kick ass stuff and they refuse to accept that not everyone wants to or can play the same way.<br />
<br />
5.  Should alternate pathways to get anything in the game exist without actually progressing through the content required to earn it -  This one actually depends a great deal on what we're talking about.  Certainly there is a good argument to be made that raid loot shouldn't be accessible to those who don't raid.  But I don't agree there is a good arguement that large chunks of an expansion which contains primarily experience zones should be locked behind flags and only accessible to raiders.  It makes no rational sense for non-raiders to continue to purchase expansions that allow them only a tiny portion of the content.  If SoE wants to continue to sell expansions, it is in their best interests to provide actually usable and viable content to non-raiders.  To do otherwise isn't rational.  It just shrinks the potential market for your product.<br />
<br />
... this isnt a far cry from &quot;I pay my 13 bucks every month and log in .... i deserve everything&quot;.<br />
<br />
Yet from your perspective you deserve everything for your $13 a month.  Access to old content to bottom feed on.  Access to old content to rub the noses of non-raiders in your uberness.  Access to new content.  Access to cutting edge content.  Access to content with higher ZEMs.  Access to raid content with better gear drops.  Access to non-raid content with better gear drops.  In fact, you believe that for your $13 a month, you are deserving of access to everything I as a non-raider have access to and everything a raider has access too, all the perks of both, all because you like to join a large group of other like minded players and take on boss mobs.<br />
<br />
Who really is the one claiming they deserve everything?  Not me, by any stretch.</div></div><hr />

A raid being anything more than an xp group.  A large gathering of people with one common goal: to kill something they cant kill by themselves or with a small group.  Loot in some cases was a perk ... in other cases it was non existant ... but in most cases the chance at droppable loot was the single driving force.<br />
<br />
Raiding has been a part of this game ever since it first started over 5 years ago and raid targets included everything from Lady Vox all the way down to Emperor Crush and Flippy-fuckin-Darkpaw ... you just had completely different crowds raiding completely different targets.</div></div><hr />

Scroll back there, bub and please dig up a link where i've thumped my chest and said i was superior because my guilds have managed to gain them some pretty kick ass stuff.  I've got 4 pieces of raid gear on me, and they come from more than 3 expansions ago each and are hardly uber.  Other than that i'm pretty much a self made man.<br />
<br />
My guild has not entered EPs or KT and beyond.  Rather i took the initiative and flagged myself for all of these and clawed my way through content slowly the &quot;casual way&quot;.  On the side, i've helped manage and lead a guild through content ranging from mid Luclin all the way to now solro tower.  I'm a guild officer and a raid leader.<br />
<br />
Dont mistake me for a &quot;have&quot; as i certainly dont have much.  I'm a casual player in a family guild who is just so happening to shoot down the whiney, pitiful bitches of other less dedicated casual players.  <br />
<br />
So yeah i worked hard and got my stuff the casual way.<br />
<br />
None of this matters, though, because at the end of the day your arguments still smell like horse shit.<br />

The &quot;infamous 2&quot; .. i assume youre talking about tipt and ikkinz?  If you are geared for the content and have followed natural porgression then they arent impossible to leap over.  If you run at them without 9k buffed (as a minimum) then you will get ripped up like wet tissue paper.

<br />
Dont be fooled ... at 9750 raid buffed hp i get slaughtered in KT on yelloy/red XP mobs if i get a few unlucky rounds (especially before slow).  This shit isnt easy, and if you cant manage to pass tipt then you really cant do jack shit once you get into the new zone you just unlocked.  In case you've never been, trash in vxed can quad for 1100 and come in hasted ... trash in tipt can hit for over 1300 in quands and come in hasted ... trash in KT are the next step up in difficulty.  This stuff isnt easy xp.<br />
<br />
This really just goes to show that you dont know much about what you are talking.  Raid mobs in EP are harder than Rallos.  Rallos really isnt hard at all once you figure out the event.  IF you cant beat RZ then you really cant do much of shit once you hit EP's as the tactics only get even more and more complicated right along-side with more ane more dps output to manage at the same time.<br />
<br />
I really just thing that most casuals view EP and KT+ as the candylands of everquest .. little oasis's where the raiders come to party, get super easy, super fast xp, and where uber loot grows on trees...  The content you find as you progress gets harder and harder.  <br />
<br />
You MIGHT be able to kill trash in C if you cant pass the boss in B, but you cant even begin to progress ... i'ts like running hurdles on an uphill slope ... it gradually gets harder progressively, but you still ahve to jump over some obstacles to keep moving forward.</div></div><hr />

Simply not true. Raid content was obviously planned from the start. It just wasn't finished until after release.<br />
<br />
Dragons added around April/May<br />
Phinigel added around June<br />
Fear added around August<br />
Hate added around Halloween<br />
Sky added around Christmas<br />
<br />
All were specifically raid content, all of them predated expansions, and yes, the original EQ box mentioned such things.</div></div><hr />

What happened next was the development of more raid content in kunark along with disciplines. The raid content started a split in progression types. Those who advanced their character through grouping, and those who raided. Now, this was just a tiny thing as there still wasn't enough raid content to matter. Then velious came and it all pretty much changed. You had two distinct groups, people who just grouped and those who raided. If you raided , you got vastly better rewards. This trend continued through PoP.<br />
<br />
What happened after pop? Well, people who just grouped wanted access to gear that is as good as raid gear? What was the problem? There is almost no progression when it comes to grouping other then moving as you level. Whereas, with raiding you went from HoT/wtov-kings-ntov-aow/tunare-low end luclin-ssra-vt-elemental planes-time and you needed certain levels of gear to progress. (Yes, some of that can be skipped now, but that wasn't the case for guilds who progressed as each expansionw as fresh)<br />
<br />
So, we got ldon. Grouping players can advance their characters up to about VT level. Before, they didn't really have that access. But, they want more and this isn't necessarily wrong. But, up until this point in the game there existed NO means to challenge a single group the same way you would a raid and require certain levels of gear/aa/coordination. <br />
<br />
GoD gave that to the single group arena. For the first time, people who group truly had to progress aswell. You needed to gear up in one place before you could take on another. And this is a GOOD thing. It allows you to give single groups advancement options, but still demanding they go through progression like everyone else.  <br />
<br />
Hopefully OoW continues the GoD path in that they allow single groups to advance their characters in a meaningful way, but it forces them to earn it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are we trying to a contructive discussion, or just clearing our mouths of all the explicatives that we reserve for our boss at work?<br />
<br />
The 500 a week, 20 hour week, figure is from my experience, I know a few others that seem to come up with similar figures, at least to me, that means that maybe it is a reasonably valid figure.<br />
<br />
Bottomfeeding/cockblocking is a problem to more than a few family/social guilds. Many people have expressed this concern on many forums.<br />
<br />
I do not think, given the ammount of imphasis on gear in this game, that large raiding guild exist because so many people want to see cutting edge content or beat the monster, it is and has always been about the loot.<br />
<br />
Given that, I'm of the opinion that large raiding guilds would not be so prevalent if that progression path was harder/less rewarding than non-raid progression.<br />
<br />
Most raiding guilds do have a progressive point system similar to LDoN, only difference is, that except for a few key members, a 72 man raid force would be hard to notice the number of afk members they have &quot;earning&quot; points. I'd love see people getting afk LDoN points.<br />
<br />
Experience content is locked behind not just slightly harder, but 72 man raid harder boss mobs. Experence conect witch is used to adjust AA point costs for everyone, whether they have access to that content or not.<br />
<br />
Raid loot exists to allow raiders to continue their raid progression. That gear works in experience groups that everyone uses. It is also used to base the difficulty of expansion mobs, whether you've raided or not.<br />
<br />
I'm not going to sit here and argue of one of these points alone. It is the combination of all these factors that makes for the issue being discussed in this thread. I'm quite sure I missed more than a few reasons on top of these that I've listed.<br />
<br />
<br />
Simply put, many non-raiders feel that they have to jump through more hoops than raiders do to end up with lesser rewards. They want gear adequate for the content they are experiencing, nothing more. If SOE is going to design experience/1-group content based on the previous expansions raid loot progression, adequate alternatives need to exists to allow non-raiders to experience the new expansion without having to be vastly less productive with thier playtime as an active raider does.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u118"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p118">none of the posters here are &quot;casual&quot; players. Some are just &quot;non-raiding&quot; types. You can not call Haass casual. Me? When I was playing I definitely was not casual either. My brother was casual. In 4 years of EQ he got his pally to level 55.<br />
<br />
Now thats that out of the way... Non-raiders who put a lot of time into this game would like something to look forward to. (reply to a previous post) Like Aarynor was a possible target for Haass. I am sure, a few expansions later, Haass could have had a great time clearing NToV with his friends. Nothing was stopping him from trying. <br />
<br />
The single zone in each expansion we knew we would never see like VP/ST/VT never used to bothered my friends much. What started bother me was when I could not take my friends to places that were a challenge for me in PoP (I was raiding at a time). I understand GoD is much of the same. Why is it that every single non-raider is not worthy to go there? From what I understand LDoN didn't appeal to non-raiders. Which to me is understandable. Some zones just dont sit well with people.<br />
<br />
I can tell you what I want and what I think Haass is driving at.<br />
- I want to advance at my leisure and have competitive to raiders gear accessible to me since I feel I put in enough time into this piece of shit game to justify it. I do not want best fucking gear or easily obtainable one. I love challenge and something to look forward to. However I think its unfair that raiders can have double/triple character power over same level of even hardcore non-raider. The difference should have never been that fucking large. We like to compete with you fuckers :) Its part of fun.<br />
<br />
If SoE would start again to develop content with challenging for single group encounters and mobs that a few groups of friends can take down for fun once in a while.... With &quot;ubers&quot; who would set the bar for non-raiders to follow and not waving like now from behind a fence. That would be EQ the way I fucking remember playing it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyways, I hope the folks at SOE come to these boards and read this stuff. I think I read somewhere that with the big guild summit that they had a few weeks ago they are now supposedly listening to their customer base more than they did in the past (more? Did they ever listen?)...or so we are lead to believe (I wonder if that includes coming to the various EQ boards). I would really like to know the status of the game in general...how many accounts are being cancelled...why are they being cancelled...etc. I assume that the intent of the guild summit was to ebb the flow of account cancellations and to address the poor game design of GoD. At least I seem to recall reading that somewhere as well. <br />
<br />
I go to alot of message boards and these issues are not unique to &quot;The Steel Warrior&quot;. These issues are being brought up on almost all of the message boards.<br />
<br />
- Some people think there are no problems with EQ...or at least, their perception is that the problems are not as severe as some describe. Furthermore, they have busted more than their fair share of ass and have earned, what they believe, a payoff befitting the effort. If you put in the effort - you should getting something in return right? <br />
<br />
- On the other hand, there are people that have the perception that there are huge content gaps/discrepencies between certain types of playing styles (the raider vs. non-raider argument that everyone who has read even a couple of posts in this huge thread are now more than a little familiar with) and that they feel like they are getting less value for their dollar as compared to other more elite EQ subscribers (raiders). From reading these and many other boards, these types of players make up a majority of the EQ subscribers and there are a sizeable number of these people who are cancelling their accounts because of a general lack of content and character progression (or a perception that this is the case) that addresses their playing styles.<br />
<br />
Which leads me big to my first question. I really wonder how good or bad the game is doing? How many subscribers are cancelling their accounts? Why are they cancelling? If it's as bad as I think it may be, SOE really has to address these issues quickly - hell, even if it's not that bad SOE has to do something quick...because if SOE hasn't already shot itself in the foot with poor game design and poor planning on game concept, then other games like WoW are definitely going to ut this old fucking horse out of its misery.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u122"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p122">With regard to cancellations -<br />
<br />
Imo there are two major catagories:<br />
<br />
1. FoH, Afterlife, Recon (or whatever it became after I left the server). If I were SoE, I'd be real concerned why guilds at the top of the heap left the game.<br />
<br />
2. Attrition/burnout. In some cases this is because players became dissatisfied with something NEW that has occured in the game. SoE needs to find out what these things might be.<br />
<br />
In other cases players complain about situations that have existed for YEARS and they continued to play anyway. SoE can try to find out what the problem was, but in some cases it's things like &quot;Too many timesinks&quot; that the designers aren't showing any signs of ever changing.<br />
<br />
SoE should be most concerned when burned-out players affect guild viability and can potentially cause large numbers of players to abandon the game simultainiously. If Billy Bob leaves a guild, then there are 100's of players that will GLADLY take his place and are still entusiastic about the game. If half of a guild leaves the game, then the other half might very well follow suit - their guild is no longer viable.<br />
<br />
If a player that has no extensive social contacts leaves the game, SoE can work on retention of such players, but the server community is generally unaware of their departure.<br />

<br />
If the player that has no extensive social contacts because the state of the game has either enticed his friends to join raiding guilds or they have left the game out of frustration, then the server community may be generally unware of that individual's departure.  However, as this cycle is repeated over and over again, and more and more people fall prey to it, that isn't an individual incident, that's a trend.  <br />
<br />
Now, this trend is happening.  The only thing debatable is whether it's a significant trend or merely a minor trend.  If minor, then SoE should pay no attention, a certain percentage of the player base will always become disenchanted eventually.  There really is no changing that after all.  However, if it's a significant trend, then that means SoE should address it as quickly and as correctly as they can.<br />
<br />
I think it's a significant trend.  Obviously other people in this thread think it's a minor trend.  Neither belief can be supported with hard evidence, because we don't have any of the recent subscription figures available.  But SoE does.  And you know they're looking at them.  Only time will tell if they, as a company, believe it's a minor or a significant trend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u125"><b>Aonodorus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p125">To say that Qvic XP is somehow a reward over any place in the elementals is completely false.  A wipe in Qvic for an xp group = hours of CR'ing, and considering the mobs are barely slowable, hit 4-5 times per round, generally in the 700-1000 range on hits, like to chain proc a 700dd, not to mention flurrying and rampaging, and then when you finally get them to 30%, turn around and haul ass (even snared the move pretty fast), i dunno, the RvR there just isn't matching up.  I've done many groups in there, particularly for the purpose of placing CoH for raids later in the day, and yes the xp is great, but it's hardly, if at all, worth the risk.  Pofire and Powater reds are much more rewarding, because at least there if you wipe, you only have to wait for 15-20 mins, instead of hours for an sk/necro to come summon your corpse ( &lt;3 see SoS kyvs and ukuns.. )</div></div><hr />

Like it or not, guilds that DO raid a lot also gain status and recognition for progressing. <br />
<br />
... from other guilds that DO raid a lot to gain status, and them that wanna be, mebbe.  Not to knock your post at all, it was well written enough, but this point underscores how wide the gulf of perception has become between the non-raiders and the raiders: it implies that the raiders think the rest of us are keeping score, too.  Add to that another's erroneous comment that the unwashed masses believe that the raid-locked zones are a *candyland* of easy XP and wikk3d lootz falling as if from heaven, and you get a vivid sense of how out of touch with each other the two castes are.  (hint:  Few of us are actually that stupid.)<br />
<br />
Raids can be fun - but they're no more difficult than anything else in the game.  Barring, perhaps, the  hurry up and wait factor prevalent when your raiding with a dolt force.  This is, after all, a vidiot game and not rocket surgery, and you don't need to be a genius to do this stuff.  Being a genius is probably a hindrance.<br />
<br />
There will be them that think that the game since PoP is the way the game always shoulda been, them that think that that's how the game always was, and them that think that SoE left one screwed pooch the wake of it.  But that's when the game started to really split the player-base between the haves and the dont haves; when the seperation became a divide, and if you don't think SoE has noticed the fallout from that design decision, you might wanna pay more attention to the changes they propose to be making - and have made.<br />
<br />
The people who subsidize the raiding game include the same people that raiding guilds recruit from when their numbers thin out, and they need more people who can use */assist* without slipping into a catatonic stupor.  And if those pocketbooks don't feel like they can keep pace with the game, if they don't feel like there is an alternate path to appreciable upgrades, if they feel that too much of the game is closed to them, they won't be around to foot the bills or to follow the MA's lead anymore.  Then what?  If you took every Time capable guild out of EQ entirely and erased the subscriptions, it would be alarming but not a dint in the profit margin.  If you took away the ones who cannot jump through all the hoops, there wouldn't be enough coin coming in to justify the servers.<br />
<br />
It comes down to the bucks, and that's what SoE needs to look to unless they want EQ1 to be one of the *niche* games in the changing MMOG market, and they'll need the non-raider caste to believe in their advancement opportunities.  Raid force flags for xp zone access send the message *you don't belong here, go away*, and perception is nine tenths of the sale.<br />

If a player that has no extensive social contacts leaves the game, SoE can work on retention of such players, but the server community is generally unaware of their departure.<br />
<br />
I betcha a large amount of the attrition are folx like this ... while the remaining are unaware that this has happened not once, but many times  (Thousands?  Tens of thousands?  Mebbe dozens, or hundreds ... bunches of indeterminate size. :p)  And as the herd thins, the number of people who are now without extensive social contracts increases and my suspicion is that the increase is nearer the quadratic than the linear.  Some will rebuild their network, once or twice, but how often?   Loss of income through customer attrition is insidious (easily confused for normal clientele turnover), and any company would be foolish to overlook it.  The loss of a guild is dramatic, but I don't believe that the bulk of the estimated 420,000 subscriptions are tied to the raiding caste.</div></div><hr />

But read the patch messages. Most of the changes are a direct response to player requests.<br />
<br />
Yes, SoE will miss those it apparently can't please, but did it really ever have a chance to retain them?<br />
<br />
SoE also notes the departure of guilds that helped to build EQ's reputation among &quot;serious&quot; hard-core gamers that find difficult content a challange and were attracted to a game that wasn't Castle Wolfenstien v25.2. The people who contributed to the perceptions of favorable reviewers and most of us were eager to emulate when we started the game.<br />
<br />
/salute FoH, Afterlife, Arch Overseers, Cats in Hats, DH(SoTS), etc. Your achievements, not Johnnie Unknown's helped make this game what it is. Some of you are gone, but not forgotten. Others still blaze a trail through cutting edge content assuring the rest of us that it CAN be done.<br />
<br />
Players that are in it for cheap thrills and instant gratification have very short attention spans. They play EQ, move to SW:G, come back to EQ, go to DAOC, come back to EQ, try CoH, come back to EQ, get involved with WoW beta.<br />
<br />
Yes, many of these players retained their EQ accounts since nothing came down the pike that was better. Now, anticipating yet another generation of MMoRPG's that will try to topple EQ, they urge that their class be given or restored to god mode, that flagging be relaxed, that mudflation moves their paltry 5000HP's unbuffed so they can quickly see content they have been exclude from before they jump ship yet again.<br />
<br />
Sure, SoE might &quot;bow to the pressure&quot;, but it will hurt the integrity of the game.<br />
<br />
I was amused when a former acquaintance gave me a &quot;Hi&quot; /tell recently. He left EQ for DAoC and returned a month ago. He was level 60 and unflaged. He wanted to know if I could help him get into my guild - sorry Charlie, the game moved on in your absence and you can't make up over a years absence in a week or two and expect a high level guild to bet on your staying power. I seriously hope he enjoyed DAoC a lot. I hope those that leave for CoH or WoW beta aren't simularly disappointed if they flop or the release of the production version is delayed once again or there is little content.<br />

All three of my sons played EQ and then quit. Then they played DAoC and quit. They started FFXI and quit. Now one is playing MT:G online and another is in the WoW beta. They are a wonderful market if you want to sell a new title - they each own hundreds of games. They are a lousy market if you want to build and retain a large persistant user base.<br />

The only way EQ could keep such players is to drop ALL flags and mudflate the heck out of the game to the point of being able to one group PoTime. And still six months later they will be gone.<br />

The answer of course is reasonableness. You shouldn't get 51 AP's for an hour of play if a modest upgrade costs 1150 AP's+, a month to get flaged for VT, and huge gaps in a casual player's progression path and gameplay opprotunities.

But I know your debate style, all too well.  You'll probably start throwing around Brenlo said again at some point.  And then you'll find some quote out of the player handbook from like 5 years ago and throw that around.

If you in fact have those 20,000 that play well you'll have the other 1,980,000 as well. Endorsements, reputation, your guitar in Eric Clapton's hands in Guitar Player.<br />

Edit: bleh, thought you said you were a guitar maker. Too bad, I might be in the market for a great custom guitar and was hoping I found a maker. Like those 1,980,000 others that don't play well, I'd like to emulate my personal guitar heroes. Step #1 is get a great guitar. Step #2 is to learn to play it, but that's just a detail. I did, of course, want a hefty discount, you could have made it my signature model (or would that be silly marketing?).<br />

Sweet, a major endorsement from an influential constituency. I'll campaign and take office always hooked up to a lie detector. I'm a shoe in provided no one's offended by the absolute truth about my background or outraged by my views. Errr wait!! I'd be burned at the stake!!!   :eek: <br />
<br />
Btw, I agree they should make a non-progression single player quest to get into the zone where Ornate molds drop - that's not the EP's however, it's the Tower of Solusek Ro.<br />

We also know they aren't going to make ultra-radical changes to EQ. They'll try not to kill the golden goose until EQ2 is gtg, then they'll try very hard to establish a large stable player base on it.<br />
<br />
We both know every decent expansion server populations double and players renew accounts - I think that's the gameplan here in out - decent expansions with initially fairly easy and rewarding early content.<br />
<br />
I don't think they'll be mudflating those that can't even be bothered enough to get flagged to get Ornate molds that drop randomly from yardtrash in ToSoRo. PoP was released October 21, 2002, it doesn't take two years to get that flag. They may ease flag restrictions, but it's lame that some players &quot;need&quot; them to.<br />

Ornate can drop from trash in Sol ro. Like any other random rare drop you can get lucky. (Lots of it in X time) Or you could get nada. Now ornate has one thing that GoD doesn't more of the gear is sellable. (And is completely overpriced IMO at least in my server.)<br />

People seem to think everyone that raids is a no skill no life looser.  all they can do is hit assist and attack. Well that is important. It's not the only thing Aggro Control is huge. Wait that means that attack might have to be turned off?  If people don't they will wipe guilds. TZ in time is a good example. Uqua is another good one. But raiders have no skill. They can't have a life they play EQ all the time. But casual nonraiders play more? <br />

Trim the arguement to what you want and keep it in reason. You say you want to progress. Where do you want to progress to? What should you have to do to get there?

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u141"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p141">Long thread with some decent points on both sides, and after sorting through it the best I could I have a question. What specifically would the folks arguing the non-raider side of things like to see? Please give a specfic example of what type of zone/play you are advocating access to and what caliber of gear you think would be an appropriate reward. Don't need an essay, just something along the lines of &quot;Flag free zone tankable with 6k unbuffed with random mobs dropping 40ac/125hp boots&quot; or whatever...(this is just an example ya rat bastages :) ) <br />
<br />
I didn't see any detail of what exactly is being called for here, and perhaps by defining what it is you think non-raiders need we can have a more constructive debate.<br />
<br />
edit: congratulations, in the time it took to participate in this thread you could have earned an aa :)<br />
<br />
 Well, I'll differentiate myself from most of the folks on 'my side', I truly AM the casual player (or was).<br />
<br />
 What I want is simple. My guild, currently, can field 2-3 groups of level 60+ of similar gear to myself. I would like to be able to do progressive content with my guild that isn't:<br />
<br />
 1) Permacamped all to hell by bored highenders, or Ebaying highenders, or twinking highenders.<br />
<br />
 2) Locked behind a flagging mob that we have no chance of overcoming.<br />
<br />
 3) Not worth the RvR.<br />
<br />
 4) Boring as hell.<br />
<br />
 I could personally give a shit about the Elemental planes, simply because my guild can't kill RZTW. But I WOULD like to be able to do more stuff on the order of the Mistress of Darkwater. Of course, we rarely do the Mistress anymore, but that's 'cause we farmed hell out of that EB cloak.  :D<br />
<br />
 My bitch is: Raiders have a portion of the pie. It's the largest portion, has the most filling, and yet they can't be satisfied with that, they've got to have ALL the damn pie, and leave crumbs for the casuals. So, as time goes on, some of my guild leave to actually get some pie, and some just burn out on Veksar Redux or RL takes over, and they just leave. Call me lazy if you want, but take a look at my Magelo - the vast majority is off of shit I killed or earned, not stuff I bought in the Bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u142"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p142">Alright, I gots a new question for the ubers.<br />
<br />
I'm assuming (correct me if I'm wrong) that the majority of your play time comes in US (Or where ever the fuck you're from) prime time.  That is to say, that you play when everyone else in your guild plays.  <br />
<br />
I have a scenario for you to imagine. Lets say that absolutely nothing in EQ or your life changes, except for the fact that you can't play at your prime time anymore.  You still get in your 20-30-90 hours a week or whatever, just not at prime time.  As soon as you log on, your guild is already back in POK, and saying their goodnites and congratulating everyone else on another fine raid well done.<br />
<br />
There is the last 10 or so stragglers that will continue to grind AA or do LDoN or whatever, but that's it, your raiding activity for the nite is over.  <br />
<br />
What do you do?  How long can you take LDoN?  How many hundred more AA's can you grind?  How long before you're bored with the game? <br />
<br />
Answer these questions please.  Honestly sit down and think about what the game offers you.  If you don't feel like replying, here, i'll fucking tell you what the game offers you.<br />
<br />
It offers you twinks, which you're going to be extremely bored of very quickly.<br />
It offers you LDoN and/or Xp, which you're going to be extremely bored of very quickly.<br />
And it offers you the chance to go back and solo/duo/small group MY content, which pisses me off very quickly.<br />
<br />
AND THAT IS IT.  Don't try to fucking spin it, because it's the truth.  Fucking try it for a week, just a fucking week, and you come back and keep saying that EQ is such a great game and everyone else that isn't at your level of the game just doesn't work hard enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u143"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p143">Now thats that out of the way... Non-raiders who put a lot of time into this game would like something to look forward to. (reply to a previous post) Like Aarynor was a possible target for Haass. I am sure, a few expansions later, Haass could have had a great time clearing NToV with his friends. Nothing was stopping him from trying. <br />
<br />
This is actually very close to the truth Casai.  Right before I called it quits with EQ, I was looking at taking a crack at Eashan and Ikiatar.  The problem?  We could never find them up.  Late nite 1 group uberguilders would go thru and clear fucking ToV.  What the fuck could they gain there?  I have no idea.  Half the shit wouldn't even be an upgrade for me.<br />
<br />
The single zone in each expansion we knew we would never see like VP/ST/VT never used to bothered my friends much. What started bother me was when I could not take my friends to places that were a challenge for me in PoP (I was raiding at a time). I understand GoD is much of the same. Why is it that every single non-raider is not worthy to go there? From what I understand LDoN didn't appeal to non-raiders. Which to me is understandable. Some zones just dont sit well with people.<br />
<br />
Pretty much the way I feel as well.  So I can't get to Sky/VP/ST until long after anything in the zone is useful to me...big fuckin deal.  I understand that there should be a zone where the best geared people can go to get the REAL shining loots (first time I saw the stats on Primal, my jaw just about dropped cuz normal people were still using fucking Jade maces and shit).  LDoN may have been designed for people like me, but they missed.  It's not what I want.  I want to do the same shit everyone else is doing, I know I'm not going to get there today, tomorrow, or even next week, but I'll fuckin get there.<br />
<br />
Elemental molds don't drop from yard trash either. People seem to think they do but they don't . Elementals isn't like Kael where you can get Thurg armor. IT's more like NToV where only the named drop the loot. There are a set of 1 group named that drop LDoN hard level gear. (Maybe a bit better) Then there's the Raid named that drop the Molds. (And other loot.) <br />
<br />
No, you're right, but bow parts do.  Bows would be an upgrade for me, and many other people, and currently the only thing bow parts do now is pad your bank accounts, and that's fucked up.<br />
<br />
Aside from that fact, I&quot;ll never get a chance to know if I can snag an elemental mold.  Maybe it will take me more people and 2 more expansions to be able to get my first, but I'll eventually get there.  Not like now where you can release 50 fucking expansions, and I'm still never gonna get flagged because I don't know 70 other people to kill RZ with.  I first saw Myrmidon and Warlord armor linked like 4 fucking years ago...the BP was one of the last things I got before I quit in January.  I was happy as hell with that.  I don't need to be cutting edge, but I need to be able to get there eventually, and right now I can't.  That pisses me off, and it should.  And if you don't realize why, then maybe it's time to step back from your guild for a little while until you do.</div></div><hr />

when your work makes you travel around the world, or just because the working hour are cycling or many other reason. you lost your attatency to your friends/guild/whatever. At best if this is just a permanent shift in your EQ time, you will just have to get new friends/guilds/whatever at start over what you were doing before, but if its not permanent, if you change of playing time every few months or few weeks you are just out of the guild job/progression/reward, and you're fucked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u145"><b>arlakisd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p145">Actually this sort of happened to me When I quit back in november. I came back in Febuary. <br />
I had 175 AA at the time I left now I have 420. I had one spot of gear I could upgrade easily and a few others I'd have to work towards. Since I Was elemental flagged I started working on tradeskills and Farming. Those are boring (I Still haven't finished) I also started doing LDoN's with my friends. Sadly When I decided once more to join a guild I didn't have as much time with some of my friends Course they had guilded also but to another guild. Am I Better than my other friend? No.. Never claimed it. <br />
As to my time onle with my Guild Well About the only time I share is our raiding time other than that I log on in VERY atypical hours for the majority of the guild. I used to LFG alot during this time Now I've just accepted I won't get a group uintil I have to run to work in 30m so I just 2 box. I've met a couple people that join me when I 2 box. Making that FAR more enjoyable, Otherwise it's just a grind. But until I get my shaman better gear/AA I won't be able to go to much harder content. But soon I'll be heading to GoD so I can get my shaman some decent gear.<br />
Now I could be called bottom feeding course these mobs could easily kill me solo. But it's not a loot camp I'm taking unless you call wristband of strategy and Specs Massive loot :) <br />
Half the time I give them to my partner I just don't care. Others do.<br />
<br />
I miss sharing time outside of raids with my guild. But at least I get to spend time with them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u146"><b>Gunnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p146">On Stromm I think we have guilds whose basic set raid times come pretty close to covering  most of the day and night.Most people have to adjust there RL's somewhat and prioritize to make raids though.I could see on a low pop server it being very difficult to get enough people raiding from midnite to 4 am though.Personally, I often work weird hours through the night,but, I raid with a pst evening type raid guild with very specific raid times.A few of my friends in the guild have similiar work schedules and adjust their rl habits to suit playing with their guild.Groups can sometimes be tough to get with my guildies due to my weird hours /shrug.<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure with me and my wife if we couldn't make many raids anymore we'd just slack and fall behind the upgrade curve.She adjusted part of her work hours to make more raids awhile back as she was only able to attend about 25 pct of raids when she first joined for quite awhile.The people in my guild  and the guild it self are more important to me than gearing up,although some casuals have a hard time understanding this.I remember when we were breaking into ep's and rl had drawn some of our core members off I said something to the effect of, &quot;I don't really care if we go back to TOV and forgo the ep's as long as we raid togeather&quot; and I meant it.The gear is bonus.I have fun raiding with these guys and I've learned far more with them than I would have playing in 6 man groups hehe.Believe what you like.If you're there for the long haul and help work to overcome all the obstacles in the path of a progressive raiding guild you'll have been challenged more than by playing in 6 man grps.<br />
<br />
Haas and Gerrik and similiar posters in this thread have the experience and ability to make stuff happen themselves.If there really is no one around when you play it may take a server jump or a new char somewhere else ...I can't speak for your server conditions.Really, if for some reason you can't find any bloody guild that appeals to you make your own.Either way it'll probably be a long tough haul with a lot of challenge,but ,it sounds like you guys need that at this point in your eq experience.I wouldn't want to take the easyway and join a time guild straight out of ntov or ssra.Cripes you'd miss so much of the game and just be getting dragged along by your guild and spoonfed upgrades.<br />
<br />
I started with my guild at level 60.I believe the average level then was about early to mid 50's then.We've fought togeather(for a large part) since then from POG &amp; Vindi and whatever we could find up through most of the available content to ep's.We didn't have the benefit of bazaar gear either.Almost all of our stuff was dropped and ts'd by us.That experience is what has made eq so much fun for me and my wife not the numbers on our gear.None of my friends want x uber warrior with 2k more hp to tank them through any hard trials instead of me.They'd rather play with me and die until we get it right hehe.<br />
<br />
I do think there needs to be more duoable,1 group,2 group adventurous content out there especially for level 65 people with pre ep gear levels.I don't think the answer is changing the rules midstream and opening up the ep planes...although i expect them to be more crowded soon hehe.Srt might be a good zone to open to allow farming of ornate.Although I can see Xulz's cave turning into a total zoo and level 70 groups keeping the mini's down permanently outa the hands of progressing guilds. :( I'd rather see new content opened up to better support GOD and the like than old content requirements changed.<br />
<br />
The difficulty in dropping a mob or finishing a quest  should always balance the reward.Of course soe knows this ,or,large parts of their game would be rendered useless.50-70 people can accomplish more stuff then 1-6 it's simple and makes sense.Otherwise,the solo guy who can't get groups or doesn't like socializing at all should be able to get the same drops as any 6 man group.The whole idea would destroy EQ and turn it into diablo.<br />
<br />
Play to accomplish stuff or just relax and explore and slowly upgrade.If you want to be competitive you'll need a raid force and lots of time and patience.The next level of challenge in eq beyond the group is the raid force.People here keep putting the whole raid thing down because of some bad memories.To raid well and have fun requires you to invest more of yourself into the experience and it won't always payout with a successful guild.I don't think you have to raid to have fun in eq.I do think they need more groupable new stuff.I think raiding is the most challenging and demanding form of play in eq and has therefore the biggest rewards...by this I don't just mean in loot.</div></div><hr />

I personally am already past that point.  I was picked up by the 2nd guild on the server awhile back, that ended up not working out within a matter of hours.  I then started my own, but my guild pretty much ended up being my RL friends, and when our hardcore cleric decided to go psycho dramaqueen bitch on us, I really lost the drive to keep going, and that's when I quit.<br />
<br />
Trust me, I've already used up all the solutions here. EQ is just not fun anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u148"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p148">EQ is just not fun anymore.<br />
<br />
And there is the crux of the problem.  They've sucked the fun out of it.  Rather than the timesinks being disguised by the fun factor they're revealed for what they are, timesinks.  Rather than people looking forward to being able to log on and go someplace new or try something different, they're stuck in the same old crap zones because they're not geared, AAed, or flagged enough.  It would be like having Kunark released and knowing that you're always going to be stuck xping in Sol B, Lower Guk, and maybe two or three other zones in Kunark because you can't get a large enough group of people together to get keys for Howling Stones, Sebilis and half the rest of the expansion.<br />
<br />
Those people who don't raid but are still fooled by the illusion of having fun while you do your timesinks, gratz to you.  Enjoy it while it lasts.  Those people who do raid and enjoy it and are amply rewarded for that effort, gratz to you too.  Enjoy it while it lasts.  The rest of us, unfortunately, are just going to fade off into the sunset.  And while some of you staying will probably say good riddance, we still represent a percentage of the player base.  How large a percentage has yet to be seen.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u150"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p150">So in essence, Partha, Glatius, and Haass...<br />
<br />
You all left EQ, I dont' like seeing you guys go obviously, you've been a blast on these and other forums, yet you're not around for your reasons, primarily because you felt that you hit a given point, and then it became &quot;grind&quot;.   <br />
<br />
I think I can understand Haass' issue moreso than the others, because he wants to do stuff that's a challenge, yet doesn't feel as though he has the opportunity based on the ability of content, and the ability of others to eliminate that content.    That's reasonable, although I still hold the position that I think you'd have flourished in GoD, particularly in Riwwi, Barindu, Ferubi, and Sewers, the sewers being instanced with repops and having challenges at the end if you choose to do that (different from say... LDoN where you mow through, get another boring adventure and repeat).    <br />
<br />
I have a more difficult time with Glatius and Gerick's position which is that stuff is just plain too hard, and that they need a &quot;leg up&quot; to thrive.   I just think that both of you are too pessimistic for your own good, and are allowing your own preconceptions and rumor to affect your fun and experiences.<br />
<br />
With Partha, I don't know, it seems like he has a fairly valid concern as well, which is that there's not a lot of non-persistent low numbers multi-group content for which to advance.    In other words, he'd like to advance with raids of 3ish groups, yet Velious and Luclin mobs are well... Velious and Luclin mobs.  I hope something is done about the issues that Partha and Haass have, because they seem pretty valid to me.   Insofar as making things easier or unlocking stuff which will eventually lead only to frustration once that glass ceiling again is reached, I dont' necessarily agree with that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u151"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p151">Its not to hard, it takes to much time is the problem. the risk Vs. reward sucks, because the risk is I am going to spend the next year and a half getting old gear that OoW will probibly invalidate.<br />
<br />
Easy LDoNs are boring, I have not died in one for the longest time, hard on the otherhand is way to much challenge, I never get invited because I dont have the Hp for it(according to casters) who tell me I need LDoN armor (no shit guys, thats why I have LFG ldon up!)<br />
<br />
There needs to be a medium LDoN setting so some of us warriors who dont raid(the big shit) can get decently challenging groups, the problem only exisists for tanks as far as I know, I dont cruise the cleric boards to see if they get asked for the mana now that there is a mana pool number ( tho maybe I should start asking to be an asshole)<br />
<br />
BoT, slow, boring and all the named are farmed by people who are waiting for their raiding guild to give them something to do, keeps me from getting armor i would use unless i buy it from them(and to do that i have to line yantis's swollen pockets further)<br />
<br />
Basically, we want something somewhat harder but not something people wont invite us to, mainly we ALL want sol ro access via a decent quest so that we can go, even when you have sol ro access, other players of your level do not so you have no one to group with, the people there in the first place tend to stick with their well geared friends.<br />
<br />
In the old days, I could do velks, and when that was no longer a challenge or an upgrade, i could move to kael, from there skyshrine, there was new zones i could head to when i felt comfertable, in kunark there was the same thing, the worst there was to be seen was a key quest.<br />
<br />
the problem with the PoP quests is they require you to have all the fucking keys to get the next one, no one does grummis anymore, so what about the people that didnt do him yet? KoS? carprin? this is why many casual/non-raiders/non-hivers cant get into sol ro, people just do stuff like MM for loots.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u153"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p153">my problem is also unique. I stopped having fun xping with friends.

At any rate over the years I have made around 30+ friends 99% of whom are casual with who I always have a blast hanging out be it small raids or xping.<br />
<br />
Before PoP we had cool dungeons to explore and which we came to love like Sebelis/HS/Veleks(not-spiders)/parts of Kael/some HoT/CoM/Greig's/SolB(FG run)/revamped CT. All of those zones offered to my friends droppable gear upgrades, xp and challenge. PoP raised the bar for XP and loot very high, to the point that there was no reason to go to any zone in previous expansion. PoP zones that were unlocked and available were all outdoor train fest piece of shit by my standards and didnt offer any dungeon crawl options I love(upon release, to people who do not raid and therefore have no flags). Also power of my character through AAs and gear a few months after PoP pretty much doubled I'd say through gaining around 100AAs and getting probably over a thousand hps.  Hanging out with friends became an un-enjoayble choir. It was either doing totally trivial content that we love from previous expansions or hanging out in outdoor PoP which we did not enjoy after initial couple of times of doing it.... <br />
<br />
I pretty much always geared up to be able to do more and more challenging stuff with my friends and now there were no longer any challenging xp spots.... Which after a few months of realizing this thought prompted me to quit.</div></div><hr />

8. Improved tradeskill items using components not found behind locked content.<br />
<br />
Other things didn't appear but would help:<br />
1. Once you have a raid alliance or a viable public raiding organization, contact higher level raiding guilds and see if you can work out a list of mobs that would benefit you and if these guilds would prohibit their members from perma-camping them.<br />
<br />
2. Sit down and actually analyze a progression path for level 60-70 for non hard-core players. See what might happen if equipped with Class/Diety armor, if Tower of South Ro did get a non-progression flag for admittance and you could farm Ornate molds, if LDoN AP's were increased, if you examined Frodlin's beliefs about some GoD content and the benefits. If there are wide gaps, then suggest to SoE how they might be bridged. If any raiding whatsoever is too much of a burden, then suggest alternatives like 18 person content.<br />
<br />
Some of you have played this game for 4+ years. It should be obvious that GM's don't log on and lead you by the hand. You have to make your own fun just like everybody else and call to SoE's attention if there is a lack of content and a incomplete progression path that prevents you from doing so.<br />
<br />
***<br />
BTW, I have a 52 Paladin twink. I'm convinced that with FT, KEI, class diety armor, etc. Being level 52 is unbelievably awesome. There's Vox, Naggy, Trak, AoW, KT, Kunark dragons. Some of the most fun content in the game with all of the ills of various classes totally removed. IMO it's possible to NOT see PoTime and still have a great time playing EQ. The only problem is players othen strain like mad to advance, but never reflect about what they are advancing towards.<br />

I do not include experiencing the same six reused maps 3830101010 times new content.  After the first few times, btw, I include all GoD trials within this same response.  You can only &quot;see&quot; new &quot;content&quot; so many times before it's old hat.  <br />
<br />
The point remains the same.  There is very little new &quot;content out there for you to see&quot; if you are a non-raider.   This is coming from a non-raiding warrior who HAS experienced it (although I couldn't tank safely in mnt trials - had to nab by *gasp* raid-geared SK boyfriend for that job).</div></div><hr />

Of course the problem with this scenario is that I am painfully aware of the gap between the raider and non-raiders.  I think the new VP quests are a step in the right direction (although speaking purely from a nonbiased viewpoint the quests maybe ought to be a little tougher), and while I do see LDoN and GoD trials as advancement areas, other than the first 10 or so times in any one of them they are not NEW content for nonraiders.  Hell, even bottom farming raiding guilds eventually leave the VT, EP, Time content to progress on to new zones.  When its a six-man team rather than a 70-man raid you need to outfit, the need to waste time bottom feeding is decreased exponentially.  Why try to sell me on the sad tale that these zones are &quot;new content&quot;?  Of COURSE they are the first time.  But after I've exhausted that, much like the raider has exhausted it, I would like to move on to something new(er), much like the raider moves on. <br />
<br />
It's a treadmill, man, and I don't want a  harder setting, I want a new goddamn exercise machine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u162"><b>DG-Slider</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p162">I do not think the fact is that some of us are not willing to raid. I for one am very willing to raid as are alot of the people I group with. However because of RL issues I cannot keep the schedule required by the top raiding guilds on my server. Yes I have checked everyone of their requirements. I cannot possibly meet the 4 to 5 night a week at primetime schedule because of my job. Now we have had people move thru our guild and progress to the raiding guilds and we are still in contact with alot of them. None of these guilds have been at all willing to allow us to join in on a flagging raid even if they are not full. I do not expect to be allowed in on the loot, would just like to be able to help them out if they are at full raid numbers. Now I know some guilds do allow people to flag with them and that is very nice of them. Just as of yet we have not found one that would allow us to do so.<br />
<br />
That is one of the most basic and truthful statements I have read. Before any raiders or UBER guilds start attacking me, please look at my link and see I came from a raiding guild during PoP. I am EP flagged but due to a job change I CANNOT raid any longer. It sucks, I miss raiding but I love the game and still want to enjoy it. As a casual gamer, or non-raider, I can state that the game does not have many outlets for casual gameplay and it is hard to stay motivated. I own 3 accounts and 2 other casual gaming friends have a couple each. All are dissatisfied, and although that's only 7 accounts, that is money that will no longer be going towards maintenance, development, and NEW CONTENT if we don't feel fulfilled from the game. Is this our egos, maybe to some degree, just as much as the ego of the raider that wants to lock everyone out. It comes down to Sony dictating a certain play style for EQ and not giving people their money's-worth. Let's see how all the raiders feel when you have everything from the Gods and there is nowhere to go b/c LDoN and regular zones are a downgrade. Guess raiders will cancel their accounts then... and we can see where this goes... Please, make the plight of the casual gamer an issue for yourself and for the game. Try to put yourself in their place, and appreciate the luxury you have of being able to play often and raid. You already see content many other gamers will never look upon short of screenshots. I hope that the RAIDER players read this closely. <br />
<br />
Someone mentioned zones that if you have an EP flag, you would be denied access to. This is a brilliant idea in my opinion. I wouldn't even mind zones with level range restrictions. If Sont wants to dictate a certain play style then let them do it fairly and across the board. There are fixes and many of the casual or non-raiders, just love the game and want to be able to enjoy it the same as you do and keep it alive and thriving for as long as possible.<br />
<br />
<br />
In closing, EQ is a game for profit and if the money stops coming in... Sony will just shut it down. Then you have no place to raid. Think it through before screaming how unfair it is for 70 players to have to split 8 items a night or about time investment. That is not or should not really be the issue. The issue should be flexibility of play style and appeal to all gamers. Truth is the same quality items should be available through raiding, questing, LDoNs and single group camps. That caters to all styles of play and keeps any of us from having to play the game in a set method. It also helps alleviate farmers like Yantis.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This quote is the key part.  <br />
<br />
The game needs to be designed so more folks can progress with more variety of play styles.  The game would be better this way.<br />
<br />
Now, it wouldn't necessarily be better for everyone, including some Battleblade, but I'm fine with that.  I want the game design to move away from what makes him happy, and permit guys like Haass to feel a sense of meaningful progression - rather than nutty ideas like staying level 52 all the time.  <br />

The game used to have that.  It doesn't know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u165"><b>Iyacc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p165">Alright, I gots a new question for the ubers.<br />
<br />
I'm assuming (correct me if I'm wrong) that the majority of your play time comes in US (Or where ever the fuck you're from) prime time.  That is to say, that you play when everyone else in your guild plays.  <br />
<br />
I have a scenario for you to imagine. Lets say that absolutely nothing in EQ or your life changes, except for the fact that you can't play at your prime time anymore.  You still get in your 20-30-90 hours a week or whatever, just not at prime time.  As soon as you log on, your guild is already back in POK, and saying their goodnites and congratulating everyone else on another fine raid well done.<br />
<br />
There is the last 10 or so stragglers that will continue to grind AA or do LDoN or whatever, but that's it, your raiding activity for the nite is over.  <br />
<br />
What do you do?  How long can you take LDoN?  How many hundred more AA's can you grind?  How long before you're bored with the game? <br />
<br />
Answer these questions please.  Honestly sit down and think about what the game offers you.  If you don't feel like replying, here, i'll fucking tell you what the game offers you.<br />
<br />
It offers you twinks, which you're going to be extremely bored of very quickly.<br />
It offers you LDoN and/or Xp, which you're going to be extremely bored of very quickly.<br />
And it offers you the chance to go back and solo/duo/small group MY content, which pisses me off very quickly.<br />
<br />
AND THAT IS IT.  Don't try to fucking spin it, because it's the truth.  Fucking try it for a week, just a fucking week, and you come back and keep saying that EQ is such a great game and everyone else that isn't at your level of the game just doesn't work hard enough.<br />
<br />
<br />
I hate xp. Seriously, it blows chunks. I do it, to get LDoN points or AA to make myself a better tank for raiding. But, I typically only doi t in 1 to 2 hour slices because it makes me want to stab myself in the eye with a spoon. <br />
<br />
Having said that if my job changed and I couldn't raid EST, then the choices wouldn't be pretty.<br />
<br />
1. force my guild (I'm guild leader) to change   - not practical, spent last 3 years building it into an elemental/near time raiding guild on est hours<br />
2. leave it in capable hands and go to a guild that raids different hours - would depend on when myplaytime was, we have a couple guilds like that on my server. I don't think I would make a good follower though.<br />
3. quit EQ<br />
4. be the new pickup raid leader of our server<br />
<br />
<br />
It would most likely be 3 or 4. Number 4 would be fun for a while, maybe. It would let me do part of what I like, which is raid and lead raids, but it's more fun because I do it with friends in my guild. <br />
<br />
Sooner or later it would be number 3. EQ as a game, sooks. There are lots of better games out there. I continue to play it after 5 years because of the friends I've made and people in my guild and a commitment to them. I enjoy leading raids and running my guild, not the mindless xp camps, blah blah blah.<br />
<br />
There's your honest answer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u166"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p166">Thanks for the honesty, most people think our end of the game is &quot;perfectly fine&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yup, that's the honest answer that I think everyone would come to.  And yet, when we have discussions on this board about what non raiders are to do, we're told &quot;Do LDON, there are plenty of zones you can XP in.&quot;  In fact, I'm sure we'll see that answer come up yet again as some people in this thread still haven't learned how to read.<br />

<br />
I still think you guys can do stuff if you want to btw.It's your choice to leave though and with the social aspects of a game such as this it's easy to see a lot of people reaching that point regardless of content.More content is here and more to come I imagine and level 70(though I hate the idea) will open up stuff a bit.Hopefully, stuff will get better and SOE will retain some integrity and not sell out for last ditch bucks.Gl in your gaming where ever you go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u171"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p171">I have a more difficult time with Glatius and Gerick's position which is that stuff is just plain too hard, and that they need a &quot;leg up&quot; to thrive. I just think that both of you are too pessimistic for your own good, and are allowing your own preconceptions and rumor to affect your fun and experiences.<br />
<br />
Frodlin, in my eyes it's the combination of things.  On the one hand if I had a solid group of friends I could count on to take a try as some GoD content, I might have been willing to do that.  But those friends have been dispersed to the four winds by the game.  On the other hand I doubt that I'm well enough geared that a pick up group would want to add me, but even if they decided to take the chance, I feel I'd probably be more of a burden to the group than was warranted.  It would mean either an extremely skilled cleric or two healers and then they might have been better off with an extremely well geared Knight or Ranger anyway.<br />
<br />
Of course I could go back to LDoN and spend six months trying to get pick up groups for the specific theme I need to gain points in so I could add some gear to my profile and perhaps slowly gain some more AAs.  But the truth is that isn't attractive to me.  I find LDoN repetative and I find LDoN pickup groups to be horrible.  It may just be my luck, but I seem to get more than what I consider a reasonable number of complete morons in my groups.  Monks who pull 5.  Necros who can't stop pulling aggro to save their lives.  Knights who feel they have to show how uber they are by ganking aggro all the time.  Clerics who seem to be semi-afk all the time.  And so on and so on.<br />
<br />
Do I think it's too challenging?  At this time, given the place I'm at in the game and the alternatives offered for advancement, it isn't so much that it's too challening, although there is perhaps a factor of that involved, but more that the choices given to me feel like a straight jacket that I'm forced to spend my time only in certain places, IF I can find people to do it with.  And I have to this for a prolonged period, just to feel confident to step into a new expansion.<br />
<br />
Sorry, I won't pay good money to be put in that position any longer.  I don't want my choices narrowed down and restricted to only one or two paths and no others.  I don't want to feel like I have to spend huge amounts of time in content I don't particularly enjoy.  And there it is.  They've taken away the fun.  They've made it restrictive and progression tedious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u172"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p172">There have been some suggestions in various threads here that might seem not only reasonable to most players but might seem reasonable to SoE. The ones I'm fondest of are:<br />
<br />
1. 18 person Medium difficulty LDoN raids.<br />
2. Adjust upward the Adventure Points for completing an LDoN Adventure.<br />
3. Individual quest for non-progression admission to Tower of South Ro.<br />
4. Revitialization of empty old content - I'm particularly enamored of the idea of reinsituting Fabled mobs.<br />
5. Get involved with public raiding on your server. If it doesn't exist, start it.<br />
6. If you are in a small guild, contact other small guilds and work out an alliance.<br />
7. Additional one player or small party quests.<br />
8. Improved tradeskill items using components not found behind locked content.<br />
<br />
<br />
1) I can agree with those. 18 person raids for guilds like mine that are very casual where we can actually have something to do if the raid targets we plan for aren't up.<br />
<br />
2) I've advocated this a few times in various threads/boards. Especially for the lower levels, point progression even on hard comes nowhere near close enough to cover spells/item upgrades until you are well past the items/spells usefulness.<br />
<br />
3) No comment really, I haven't topped out to 65 with any of my characters. I love the 10-55 game.<br />
<br />
4) This is something that I would really love to see done. Redoing old dungeons and zones.<br />
<br />
a) Adding new steps to further some of the old world progressive quest such as the quenos badge and XXX symbol of &lt;insert diety) quests.<br />
<br />
b) Further progression type quest for class armor, starting with the noobie armor/weapon quests in your hometown. Real &quot;epic&quot; type quests you start from the first day you set foot on Norrath to your 65th season.<br />
<br />
c) Expanding content off of old world zones and themes such as our favorite old world dungeons like Clan Crushbone, Unrest, and Runneye. Make them &quot;progressively zoned&quot; so to speak. Hate those blue crushbone cronnies with a passion? Want to see them dead everytime you log on and thats all you want to do? Make new zones deeper inside these old dungeons that get higher and higher level as you zone deeper and deeper. Maybe Crushbone is just a puppet ruler after all and there's a real and mysterious threat deeper inside, maybe underneath the castle. You can be the one to discover and defaet this threat and rid Faydark of opression and slavery by these orcs. I think the devs started with Sol a/b/c, this could be expanded upon. Maybe if all I like to do is kill orcs, I can go all the to 65 and beyond just killing crushbone orcs.<br />
<br />
I'm not talking about LDON type cookie cutter zones where only the level change as you progress. I'm talking about true zones with unique mobs and quests, only off of the themes of already existing zones that we love. This has the added side effect of populating these old run down zones that are far out of the way for lower levels that is normallly a drawback for leveling in these zones. Died at level 30 deep inside Crushbone b? Grab a passing 45 necro while he is on the way to crushbone c. Maybe make zone chat for all the a/b/c zones common. I'm tired of seeing empty zones that have great content simply because people don't like to be completely alone. Hell, /ooc chat in some of the better zones is reason enough to level there simply because of the community feeling and lively chatter going on in these zones.<br />
<br />
Make ZEMs the same, don't punish people reliving old content.<br />
<br />
d) Adjust some of the old world quest to be more inline with the current risk(time)/reward that the game has come to have. Look at some of the old unsolved quests and figure out why no one has solved them yet. Adjust them accordingly. Reevaluate old world loot tables, nothing major, but most of the stuff you can loot in these zones aren't even worth holding on for vendor trash.<br />
5 &amp; 6) Make a public raiding tool that can be used in-game to plan/advertise coming raids. Give guilds/players event planning tools to post coming events and raids, allow people to comment or sign up for these events. IN-GAME, most player don't handle anything game related outside fo the game. Give guilds/raid an option to select a master looter that can hold and distribute loots after the raid or event is over, even if its no-drop. Give guild tools to track attendance for raid rewards or their point system. Provide an in-game guild-bank function.<br />
<br />
7 &amp;8) These have been asked for many times. I agree, however the ball has been SOE's court for a long time on this one.<br />
<br />
I'd like to add a few things to this list.<br />
<br />
9) Persistant messaging system (email, bard mail). The benefits are obvious. Chit chatting with friends when you can log on together. Planning events, coordinating raids, messaging guilds, negotiating trades...etc.<br />
<br />
10) OFF-LINE TRADERS Why isn't this implemented? This is a no duh just like the messaging system. A more active trade economy benefits everyone. Not just the select few that can run dedicated traders (I'm one of them, but I was on dail-up for a long time.) 24/7. surely SOE would like to see that bazaar server/bandwith load decreased from 500 afk traders.<br />
<br />
Well, too bad I decided to bury this behind 20+ pages of ranting and filth. I've said my peace, I've said these things before on other threads that noone seems to be interested enough in to say /bump even. Oh well, I've done what I can, lets see if anyone else can come up with some more offerings.<br />
<br />
EDIT: BTW, I'd pay a premium for an expansion of this kind. Yes!, even the old world revamps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u173"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p173">Well, too bad I decided to bury this behind 20+ pages of ranting and filth.<br />
Well Frodlin has started a thread covering this for casual players input only. And that's OK, we've  had a spirited debate, including both &quot;ranting and filth&quot;, that may have teased out an idea or two worth passing on to SoE. It is time to collect those ideas.<br />
<br />
Nothing prevents you from restating things on that thread, although I'm sure Frodlin will pass on things from this one as well.<br />
<br />
You observed on that thread that there is no Casual Player Correspondent. Such a person would have to read a dozen class boards. Under the circumstances I'm guess you'll have to be satisfied with having a Warrior Correspondent (Frodlin) that notices threads like this and follows through on them.<br />
<br />
It is interesting that the issues and possible solutions are remarkably different from the Top 10 Warrior Issues. It looks like EQ players aren't well served by &quot;one-size fits all&quot; expansions - a situation SoE may have been aware of, but wasn't sufficiently addressing.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u174"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p174">With Partha, I don't know, it seems like he has a fairly valid concern as well, which is that there's not a lot of non-persistent low numbers multi-group content for which to advance.    In other words, he'd like to advance with raids of 3ish groups, yet Velious and Luclin mobs are well... Velious and Luclin mobs.  I hope something is done about the issues that Partha and Haass have, because they seem pretty valid to me.   Insofar as making things easier or unlocking stuff which will eventually lead only to frustration once that glass ceiling again is reached, I dont' necessarily agree with that.<br />
<br />
 Y'Know, I (and most of my guildies, if you ask them) don't mind if it's Velious or Luclin or even Kunark - a lot of stuff that drops there is still an upgrade, like my neck from HS was. The problem is, we're basically a little past the point in time where Luclin was cutting edge - we may have levels, some of us, but we're not fully AA'd by any means (most of us, anyways - /wave Zazmadaz), we're in a mix of Velious/Kunark/LDoN/Bazaar/whathaveyou gear that probably doesn't stack up to Mid-Luclin raid drops as a whole. Add that to the numbers game, and we maybe could do a lot of stuff - but most of the stuff worth doing is gone and gone by the time we could get organized, and a lot of the stuff left just isn't worth the potential trouble a casual guild can get into. Hell, the EP guilds on Brell, thanks to the shakeup, STILL are hitting VT every now and then, and the Time guilds are 24/7 backflagging, and it pushes everyone down the totem pole a lil' bit more when it comes to quality raid mobs. <br />
<br />
 To be honest, you'll find a lot of PoM/Veksar/HS gear on DA toons because those places are still an upgrade for us or were, but are so far beneath raider's target lists as to leave them still standing. And THAT'S the content ceiling the true casuals like me are finding, and it's awfully low, that particular ceiling.<br />
<br />
 Thanks for your understanding, Frod. I'm hoping it's fixed somehow myself, but I don't see a way for it to happen as the game is built now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u175"><b>Vikken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p175">Well Frodlin has started a thread covering this for casual players input only. And that's OK, we've  had a spirited debate including both &quot;ranting and filth&quot; and ocassionally perhaps an idea or two worth passing on to SoE.<br />
<br />
Nothing prevents you from restating things on that thread, although I'm sure Frodlin will pass on things from this one as well.<br />
<br />
You observed on that thread that there is no Casual Player Correspondent. Such a person would have to read a dozen class boards. Under the circumstances I'm guess you'll have to be satisfied with having a Warrior Correspondent (Frodlin) that notices threads like this and follows through on them.<br />
<br />
It is interesting that the issues and possible solutions are remarkably different from the Top 10 Warrior Issues.<br />
<br />
BB<br />
<br />
Yes and thankfully we have such a good correspndent that we know actaully reads and participates on this board. I agree, a general correspondent probably wouldn't work out.<br />
<br />
Warriors are in my opinion about the single most balance class right now, next to paladins and druids. Warriors are a very fun and challenging class to play, its reassuring to see people rolling new warriors day by day in my guild. not just twinks, but actually being played. i remember when my main was a druid and I was just getting in PoP. I wouldn't touch a warrior to be MT with a 10 foot pole. I would have rather soloed than waste my time. I really think that things are starting to bright for the classes in general. Maybe then we could all focus on the game as a whole, something that I think has been neglected somewhat by comparison. now with the level increases, I fear we'll be at it again. Heh, I just realized that I haven't seen a berzerker in a while, maybe they'll get some lov'n soon too.<br />
<br />
I have my issues with the a few things in the game, but I hardly consider them major. I think SOE has been doing a fine job lately, from the 5th aniverary stuff to GoD, despite the initial issues. I have some guildies doing GoD pretty heavy right now and are having a blast. I can't wait to get geared up for those zones and check it out.<br />
<br />
After OoW comes out I really do hope SOE goes back and start putting some lov'n to the old zones. They are some of my favorite zones, and I wasn't even playing when EQ first come out. It just seems that a lot fo the old world zones had a lot of thought put into them, moreso at least than Luclin, LoY or LDoN had. SoV with those silly dwarfs, wise dragons, and annoying giants were all lotsof fun with the factions, worthwhile quests, and nice loot drops to this day. PoP blowing all the previous loot out the water. Even Kunark, an aquired taste, has some fun zones (/wave vekzar). I hated Luclin though, still can't stand it. LoY, beside the banks slots seem to have been a waste of time. LDoN's progression while boring, does allow one to progress steadily and you never have to worry about all the camps being taken in PoV, decent pp, even after the nerf, points for gear, dropped loot, worthwhile xp, and augments. For all the pluses, if they had just made zones more unique in them it would have blown away all the expansions. Especially if the raids would have been worthwhile for everyone. Good thing is, they way its made they can and have been adding on to it ever since.<br />
<br />
I don't know its just that maybe I haven't really hit all the bad stuff, but I find myself with more worthwhile things to do than I've ever had starting 1.5 years ago. I made my suggestions about what I think will really take the game into the next generation of MMOs. I can only hope that some of them come to be and that others will contribute their ideas on what they think will truely improve the game, and not just their playstyle/class adenda.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u176"><b>Gart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p176">I think the term &quot;casual&quot; is not very precise.  It should be &quot;non-raider&quot;.  <br />
<br />
There are lots of folks who play MORE than raiders, and if time=work as some believe, they are hosed with the present progression path to gear.  <br />
<br />
It pisses me off to hear some raiders crap on non-raiders about &quot;doing the work&quot;, when the non-raider does do more &quot;work&quot;.  If raiders are whining that raiding is &quot;harder&quot; and not fun, STFU.  Persumably you are doing it because you like it and want to do it.  If not, that's your issue and either see a therapist or don't be a freaking hypocrite and beat on guys who want to increase progression paths for those who, like the hyporcritical raider, don't or can't raid with large numbers do INconsistent play time or choice.  <br />
<br />
Personally, I think the answer is simple.  Don't design any more expansions with a progression path like PoP.  Some limited flagging is ok, but locked off zones should be FEW and FAR between.  The Sebilis model placed the boss in a dungeon everyone could use (Sebilis does not count as a locked off zone in my book-that key quest is actually about right).  ToV is another great example.  That design is superior v. the shit design that was PoP.  <br />
<br />
People blame GoD for killing EQ, but I think it was aftershocks of PoP that did.  That's what started the decay.  All that backflagging BS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u177"><b>Macenion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p177">Hey Guys<br />
<br />
Okay i just finished reading all 29 pages of this and I would like to bring up a few points but first i will clarify my RL situation then i will explain why i feel i have hit the upper end of my warriors life<br />
<br />
1. I am in Australia<br />
2. My days are you nights as long as u are in the USA anyways<br />
3. If i want into a raiding guild i have to be in a 9 to 5  job and pray i can get into an aussie guild that raids(currently only one on my server) or work nights and spend my days raiding or change my days around so i am awake from 2am in the morning every morning for raiding with a hardcore US/Euro guild.<br />
4. I am a security Guard so  i can work any time of any day and cannot give my prospective guild any more than a weeks notice(on a week by week roster)<br />
5. i have a 6 year old son i get every second weekend and actually want to spend time with him, when it rains he will sometimes watch me play eq but otherwise when i have him we are out spending time together.<br />
<br />
Now i am currently lvl 65, have been so for over a year and am now at 39aa,  i have 5523 hp and 1371 ac unbuffed. Some of the gear i have was from when i was in a raiding guild but am now in a family guild that is lucky to raid once a week. Now before this Group of friends i was guildless for 6 months and the reason for this was i could not balance my RL commitments with the raiding lifestyle of eq. I ended up burning both ends too often no matter which way i tried to manage both eq and RL. My relationships were affected, my job was affected  and my health was affected, because i tried to fit in with what EQ has become today.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is now my typical day(when i can actually log on)<br />
<br />
I log on i ask my guild if anyone needs me, do a /who GUILD all and find 4 bazaar bots and myself. Great okay time to put up lfg message i will not change it now just to stick it to some asswipe raiders on Xev. The message reads ldon norm or hard/Bot/HoH/Torment/Tactics/GoD. Every night without fail i get a tell, what is you unbuffed hp, i tell the truth and get(except for 1 instance) take hard ldon out till u are 6500 hp unbuffed take god out till 7 to 7500 unbuffed and quit wasting our fuckin time by advertising what u cannot do. Some are polite about it, others say that either exactly or worse.<br />
Now Xev is an old server, it is very topheavy and has alot of 9k+ tanks who when they are not raiding shock horror, they are exping  in my play time. Now i see in this thread, god is doable at 7khp, all well and good, but who the hell is gonna choose a tank with my stats over a 9k+ tank. What is left for me in the way of progression. The answer<br />
<br />
LDON Normals. <br />
<br />
Now dunno if i mentioned it here, but last weekend we took down vindi as a guild, we were hyped saw tormax was up went to try for him found an ep guild 1 grouping him. I sent the tank of this group a tell asking a) why they needed tormax at all and b) wondering if i could arrow tormax(i need the faction hit) his response to me was in OOC instead of a tell and read &quot;Fuck off and go back to the ldon normals where u belong, you and your no name fuckin guild do not deserve a mob like tormax&quot;. <br />
<br />
I was very upset and it took a lot of persuasion on the part of my guild leader for me not to do something really crazy but then i come here and see this mentality in the creator of this post and others that posted on it. What gives you the right to judge me for not raiding full time, what give you the right to decide that i am not good enuff to attempt a mob, WHAT gives SOE the right to tell me that GoD was aimed at the 65+ player group when it was clearly raid orientated. There was nothing in the advertisements regarding the fact i was going to need Elemental Plane+ gear to be able to tank here, nothing in the requirements that said i had to have over 9k hp buffed before i had a hope in hell of surviving here yet that is what i get told day in day out.<br />
<br />
And the raiders say we have it better than ever because we can fall back on ldon normals. Yet oh yeah dont forgot the part that when i can play,  i am competing against all those same raider tanks with over 9khp. So how often do i get a group, probably 2 in 5 times i log on. With one of those 2 times being the one day i can log on when the rest of my guild is online. The rest of the time i spend playing my bard alt, specially when i know i have a set time limit on how long i can play and have used half of it sitting lfg.<br />
<br />
For some of you mixing eq with RL is easy, for some of us it aint so easy, I play this game to relax, but more and more lately i log off thinking what the hell did i acomplish in that 3 hours.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah got another half a yellow of 53 on the bard caus i couldnt get a group with the warrior because according to the players of EQ he isnt good enuff because he cannot RAID!!!!!!!!!<br />
<br />
Bruenoar Battlehammer<br />
Overlord of Brell<br />
Valde Trucido<br />
Xev Server<br />
<br />
PS:- i know someone will try and flame me over this post but hey thats kewl, some people will understand where i am comming from and why i feel i have nowhere to move with my warrior.<br />
<br />
PPS:- in another thread i asked if anyone could recommend a server that was newish/less of the mentality of the xev server base in relation to the bullshit hp thing that i could transfer brue too and noone was able to answer, does this mean that he is doomed to retirement?</div></div><hr />

While maybe not as severe a problem, not all European players are on European servers.<br />
<br />
E'ci has (afaik) player from Asia and North America. While this created special problems, the server did have at one time three higher level guilds - Vane, Reconstructed, and Souls of the Shadows and well as public raiding.<br />
<br />
I mention both of these things because they show how the part of the world you are in and how its affects your gameplay is difficult for SoE to solve.<br />
<br />
European players have to speak English and get up at absolutely crazy hours to play on non-European servers. Concider yourself relatively lucky, you speak English (rather well for an Austialian too!). That's half the burden they face. All you need to do is get up at crazy hours.<br />
<br />
Or you could learn Japanese and have slightly less crazy hours.<br />
<br />
Or taking E'ci as a model, you could hope SoE makes additional multi-regional servers. But like I said E'ci at least before instanced content had a few problems.<br />
<br />
Finally you could convince 4,000 people in your region to play EQ if and only if SoE gave you a regional server.<br />
<br />
Looks pretty bleak to me too.<br />
<br />
SoE can not solve everyone's scheduling problems. Someone that plays on Midway Island and can only play 4 hours a week in 1 hours segments is going have a different gameplay experiance than others.<br />
<br />
SoE can make a new /lfg system, instanced content lke LDoN, ease the amount of time it takes to complete some raids, unlock some content that allows more of a progression path, etc. But so far, they can't play the game for you if you can't sit down at the keyboard when other people are playing.<br />
<br />
Hope you find a solution. Perhaps you could concider a moving 8P. Prisons are a major industry in Texas (GWB former Govenor) and Florida (Jeb Bush current Geovenor), and they need guards.<br />

I don't know what is SoE position on arassment (and especially of that kind), but with this situation, it wouldn't be surprising to see this person mining other progression as well (see this post, especially the end of the third paragraph) and at the end we should be able to get enougth proof that this guy doesn't &quot;play nice&quot; and should be warmed or banned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u183"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p183">Think for a moment.........<br />
<br />
Let's pretend for a moment that group killing KT had been all anonymous. It's not beyond possible for 5 PoTime+ players and one much lower level friend to kill KT for loot. Are you absolutely certain NO (0) members of that group could use the drops and they would ALL rot? Did they get any experiance or faction?<br />
<br />
What if they added a couple of level 50's that were LOWER progression level than you. Should the lowest progression level players have prescidense over ANY raid that's at a higher progression level including yours?<br />
<br />
Did you engage first? Where they engaging a mob that they could derive 0 benefit from (no usable items, no experiance, no faction, no tradeskill items).<br />
<br />
I happen to give up the Rockhopper camp should someone enter it that can get experiance. However, I NEED those Rockhopper hides too for tradeskilling - and that's why they wander past all the dead mobs and stand in front of me in the camp in all honesty, not for the high ZEM in the Rockhopper caves. They USE the fact that they are lower level than I to see if they can STEAL my camp that I have a 100% legitimate reason to be doing.<br />
<br />
Isn't that what you did? Wander past the dead Giants knowing full well KT was engaged so you could be indignant that someone who was further along in the game was killing a mob? So you could decide without being absolutely sure a high-level player was gyping you?<br />
<br />
What further progression content does killing KT unlock for you? How was this &quot;cockblocking&quot;?<br />
<br />
The /ooc comment should have been /reported. However, just because you are lower progression level does not give you a SPECIAL right to mobs. Didn't you just kill Vindi? Do you contend everything from Qvic and below should be your private game reserve while I should be allowed to hunt nothing, just because I'm more powerful than you? Sort of reverse Darwinism isn't it? The weak get everything while the strong can wait for Inkta'tu to repop.<br />
<br />
My guild happens to have a don't kill list of progression mobs we don't do anymore - we aren't griefers and we don't race lower level guilds to content they can use that's not on our target list. However, I'm pretty sure there a a fair number of very very old content non-progression mobs not on that list and that are fair game.<br />
<br />
Did they engage first? Was a mob engaged by others? Were they stealing your camp or did you wander over to THEIR mob?<br />

In 6 months of asking around I've yet to have anyone give me a /tell, &quot;We're doing KT, get over here for a faction hit.&quot; In the absence of this &quot;help&quot;, I'm quite willing to help myself. If that means KT dies and a low level guild that couldn't be bothered to give me a /tell in 6 months doesn't get the loot, then he dies. A good RL friend could also use the items. He's quite low level and I'm looking foward to helping both him and myself.<br />
<br />
High level players seldom fight mobs that do not benefit them in anyway. My twinks don't even need KT loot. Maybe if he drops something that is droppable, I'd loot it and sell it - I have pp requirements just like anyone else. 13kpp in the bank, QVic armor costs 11k PP to make. Care to list the droppable items (non-tradeskilled, I'm struggling enough to finish Tailoring) in Kod'Taz and beyond that can be sold?.<br />
<br />
Is asserting a &quot;special&quot; right to mobs not on the progression path just because you are at a lower progression level trump any other legitimate reason to kill these mobs including being there first and engaging first?<br />
<br />
BTW, KT is likely on my guild's list of mobs we don't touch if a lower level guild is in the zone and might be killing. In such a case it would be me giving you a /tell asking if I could help out or at least get a faction hit - even if I was there first with a fully capable group.<br />

 Seriously, though, who are you to tell someone that they cant kill a mob just because someone needs it more?  So on the same note should farming of things which dont give you xp for tradeskill stuff be wrong?  Should farming random named for loot be wrong?  Should rolling on something in a group you cant use in a group but your alt, friend, or bank account could benefit from?<br />
<br />
I'll agree that it is a rather assinine thing to do, as KT is such a nice target for lower level guilds, but you're treading on thin ice here with your argument.  I'm sure you are guilty as charged of similar things, as pretty much everyone has done it at one time or another.  Have you ever farmed anyting for an alt, and if so, how do you know that someone else didnt come looking for it 5 minutes later that could use it for their main?  It is the same exact thing as a bunch of ubers 1 grouping a raid named to sell the loot or give it to an alt, just on a slightly smaller scale.<br />

There is nothing stopping them from killing the mob.  But, we have had a number of people who aren't in high end raiding guilds come here and say, &quot;the high end raiders are bottom feeding the crap out of stuff that would be a challenge for us and cockblocking, either intentionally or unintentionally our progress.&quot;  Then we have a bunch of high end raider types say, &quot;oh no, I and my guild and everyone I know would never ever bottom feed, it just doesn't happen.&quot;   We have someone share a very specific instance of not only people bottom feeding, but the bottom feeders being complete asshats about it in the process, and now it's &quot;who are you to tell someone they can't kill a mob, blah blah blah.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm sorry, but just because you're bored with what you can do in a single group shouldn't mean that I have to be.  I can definately see how it could suck to be in a guild trying to find one of these mobs up, but the truth is KT is not a progression mob for guilds raiding at that level any longer. It's a target of oppurtunity. It's for loot the same way it is for us -- except ours is going to fund the plat sinks that we have to put up with where we are 'raiding'. <br />
<br />
With that said, there is a major difference between being courteous to others when you're playing EQ, and being complete jackasses because you think you're uber. Your problems lie in the people who bottom feed as the latter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u192"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p192">I was under the impression that Tormax was part of the progression with AoW and Vindi, back in Velious days.

<br />
 Why is it now wrong for a guild to attempt that same logical progression that you did, merely because alternatives exist? One would think you'd be pleased that someone was doing it 'the right way', rather than LDoN farming to EP, which pissed off a great deal of EP guilds who were rather vocal about it.</div></div><hr />

Glatius, I usually support your comments, but lately everything you say has been nothing but complait after complaint. If you have issue with the game, offer up some solutions so that we can discuss them. Otherwise, you are doing nothing but wasting breath on this thread. being frustrated is one thing, but you made it such that nothing wil make you happy short of eveyone forced to play your way, and subcribe to your version of fair play.<br />

I have no issue with high level guild members taking out old targets. I do have issue with guilds using the game system to block the progress of others though, be that gear or flags. I can't offer much of a solution either though. perhaps make these certain mobs such as AoW and tormax attackable only by raided players, this insures they stay the raid targets they were intended to be, and not just 1 group playthings for uber guilds. If those ubers want to kill those mobs, they have to be in a raid to do it.<br />
<br />
Side note: Specifying a minimum/maximum raid size that can engage these mobs insures that they stay the raid targets they were intended to be.</div></div><hr />

BB no offence, but you dont understand even the basics. Non-raiders - ppl who dont give a fuck about raids... Raids are once a month type of activities if ever. Because non-raiders do not enjoy fucking raiding and even finding 3 groups online is for some a rare sight... So LDoN raids, public raiding and guild alliances are out of the question. Ppl are sick of LDoN for whatever reason, maybe even because dungeons are instanced and offer little social interaction with other players, also sometimes there happen to be more then 5 of my friends online we pretty much never turn anyone down and they come down and we used to split in a group and half or whatever.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u197"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p197">Weird...well, this thread went in a different direction than I was hoping while I was at work.  Oh well, I'm gonna derail the derail here.<br />
<br />
What I was attempting to do in my last post was show that the alternatives that raiders say that non raiders have, are basically bullshit.  If you're not raiding, you don't want to play the game either.  This is a serious problem.  Think about it.<br />
<br />
EQ is over 5 years old now.  This is long enough for people to get a college education.  The thing is that for some people who were in college or in somewhat more lax situations for gameplay when they started EQ, they may not be in the same situation currently, and that is leading to a point where they can no longer enjoy EQ, simply because of the hours they play.  We see evidence of it all the time.  5 years ago, you're doing some classes from 8am till the early afternoon, you come home, raid in the evening, stay up all nite long and get back up to do it again.  You've got no real responsibilities, and EQ fits in with this.  As soon as you get to a point where EQ is no longer number 1 in your life, you literally can't play it anymore.  <br />
<br />
That's what happened to me.  I was offered a 20 grand a year raise, with the stipulation that I worked overnites, and my days off were tuesday, wednesday and thursday.  Not real raid friendly days, not real EQ population friendly days. Nothing at all changed, except for the fact that I needed to be a man and make the right decision in my life.  I still love gaming, I still think that EQ is an awesome game, but now it's completely unplayable.  It's absolutely mind boggling to think that I can't get something accomplished in a fucking VIDEO GAME at 3am on a wednesday.  The people in charge of the show down at SoE need to realize that this is a problem that is going to continue to haunt them as their player base matures, and if they don't recognize the causes of this problem, and take steps to rectify it, it WILL be the downfall of the game, mark my words.<br />
<br />
How do we change it?  It's pretty easy.  First of all, stop locking me out of zones simply because I don't have 72 friends.  XP zones locked behind raid content is bullshit, because it forces the dev's to make shit expansions like LDON to compensate for the non raiders.  We don't want that crap, we just want to be able to advance like everyone else.  Plus it makes sense from an economic perspective -- why the fuck would you waste time making content for 2 groups of people?  Just make one set of content that satiates both needs.  PoP was the worst design flaw in the game, and the solution was flawed as well.  Don't create meaningless repetitive shit just for the sake of filling our time.  I don't want meaningless shit, I want to keep growing and keep going thru a storyline (well, as much as EQ can create a storyline).<br />
<br />
Second of all, you've gotta make the game so that it's not such a complete fucking waste of time if you can only log in for an hour or 2.  An hour or 2 for most people means 45 minutes LFG.  Tradeskills are not the answer since they're currently such a waste of fucking time that it's not even funny.  Maybe make more tradeskill quests that don't involve me getting drops in zones that are locked to me (hi fucking retarded bristlebane's party platter quest), but the quests need to result in items that are worth the time, and probably no drop.  I don't have all the answers here, but that's mostly because it's not a real concern for me.  My friends and I logged on, grouped up, buffed, and off we went.  There was no such thing as downtime for me, but I realize that most people aren't so lucky, and have to deal with the LFG daemon.<br />
<br />

He's right about that shit tho.  I brought up the bottomfeeding point like 20 pages ago, and all I got was &quot;Oh, we never do that, ever, for any reason, what point is there?&quot; and now that we get a specific example, some of the people who don't have a clue in this thread jump right in and defend it.  Fuckin 9th ring my ass.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If the zones were not locked then they would be ruined for the one thing they are intended for .... raiding.  EP's and GoD beyond trials 1-6 are raiding zones.  There is xp there, but there isnt really any small time raiding content there at all.  If EP's had not been locked then a couple of things would happen.<br />
<br />
1. the zones would be overrun with trains<br />
2. the zones would be crowded to an extent where raiding isnt very possible<br />
3. Guild/guild competition would be atrocious, and things such as ring events in PoE would be potentially blown 24/7<br />
4. There would be 1000 complaints from people not geared for the content that the content was too difficult (much like they are doing with GoD atm).<br />
<br />
Sony has provided plenty xp/explore content intended for non-raiding individuals.  They have also provided content for raiders who want to progress in an orderly manner.  Why is this so hard to understand?  Elemental Zones are raiding zones first and foremost.  They are not simply these neato little xp zones flowing with milk and honey.  Yes there is xp ... yes there some single groupable loot .. yes there are some tradeskill items ... but no these arent the only zones with such niceties.  Pretty much all zones in PoP pre-EP's have xp ... they all have loot which can be gotten with 1 group ... and they all have some sort of tradeskill niceties, so why should EP's be any different.<br />
<br />
With the potential of unlocking Time level zones in single group encounters which have both loot and xp which blows single-groupable EP content out of the water, Haass, you can't really make that arguement anymore ... but then again you quit so you wouldnt know that.<br />
<br />
Anyways most PoP content is doable with 30-50 people pre-EP.  Even RZ is doable in such a way, and most server have pickup raids to help cover flags.  Many servers, such as my own, have even broken into the EP's via pickups and private raid clubs not sharing a common guild name.</div></div><hr />

Vikken, I have no problem with people going back to take down old content.  But, it is an obstacle to those trying to take on that content when it's actually a challenge for them.  It would be one thing if it was a mob that spawned every couple of hours, it's another when it's a mob that's up once a week.  Be that as it may, the thing that pisses me off is the sanctimonious types who want to claim it's not happening.  Bullshit.  It happens all the time.  I have personally been bum rushed by guilds that considered themselves more uber than the guild I was in on more than one occassion.  I've been leap frogged for content that would have been a major challenge and fun for the guild I was in, only to have the guild leap frogging AEing everything just to get it out of the way and not even considering the loot that dropped as worthy of being looted (Fear clearing so they could take down Cazic, regardless of the fact that my guild had been standing at the zone in, buffed, and about to enter).<br />
<br />
At least people could be, 1) honest about it, and 2) polite about it when they do it, and 3) not claim that the only thing holding non-high end guilds back is their inability to succeed at the content.  It's pretty damn hard to succeed at content that you're not allowed the opportunity to attempt except once in a blue moon.<br />
<br />
As far as offering up suggestions on how to fix the game, other than splitting it completely in two and not allowing anyone into content they're grossly overpowered for, I'm not sure how to fix it.  I take that back, one thing that comes to mind is to start putting naggy and vox like procs on old content boss mobs so that if you've got such and such a flag or some other criteria, you get auto ported from the zone if you try to attack the boss.  This would piss high end  raiders off no end, but then since high end raiders are being allowed exclusive content, it doesn't seem completely unreasonable to allow low end raiders the same privilege.</div></div><hr />

Sure what they said wasn't the kindest thing in the world, but here's the thing.  I don't believe that he said that to you.  I believe you said something over tells, and he responded, and you're changing the story around to better fit you.  Do I have any evidence?  No, but the way you described it was &quot;all too convenient for the casual plight which is non-existent&quot;.  <br />
<br />
There are some real asshole Elemental guilds out there.  A good chunk of them are on my server.  However I've never even heard of someone responding the way they did unless previously antagonized.<br />
<br />
King Tormax dies a lot on this server, probably like on every other server.  Thing is, he's dead more often than not to the casuals and lower end players.  You know why?  Because the Elemental+ guilds are all too busy raiding in, you guessed it, Elemental+.<br />
<br />
Patch days tend to draw some people kill old mobs such as King Tormax, because no one is raiding and he's a one groupable mob.  It's no big deal, Tormax will be back up, and it serves as much purpose for the ele guild to kill him as the bazaar guild.<br />
<br />
The bazaar guild generally wants to say &quot;Yup, we killed King Tormax...&quot; where as the ele guild wants to go &quot;Yup, look how few people we killed King Tormax with&quot;.<br />
<br />
Are they going to give the loot to alts?  Most likely, and there's nothing wrong with it.<br />
<br />
Are eles the only people who go on these raids?<br />
<br />
Obviously not if there's a sudden inflation of White Dragon Helms on my server, where every Tom, Dick, and Larry has one, and one dumb trader has sat here for two months trying to sell the same one.  Obviously not if, while all the &quot;uber&quot; guilds are up and raiding Tormax is still down.<br />
<br />
Just because you're a lower end or casual guild, does not mean you deserve any kind of precedence.<br />
<br />
High end guilds have to put up with missing spawns, they have to put up with other guilds getting to their targets first, they have to put up with other guilds farming the mobs they need to gear their people.<br />
<br />
Just because you're a casual or a low end player doesn't mean you shouldn't have to put up with the same thing, nor does it mean you are excluded from these.  If someone is to Tormax first, then its theirs, regardless of their numbers.<br />
<br />
BB no offence, but you dont understand even the basics. Non-raiders - ppl who dont give a fuck about raids... Raids are once a month type of activities if ever.  <br />
<br />
Don't speak for all casuals.  You're not the entire body of casuals.<br />
<br />
There are some posts devoted to &quot;there's no low end raiding for casuals&quot;, some are &quot;I want more content&quot; others are &quot;I want ubers to suffer because I can't have what they have&quot;.  There's no &quot;one&quot; topic concerning this and disregarding good ideas is stupidity.<br />
<br />
Low end LDoN raids for example...are a good idea.  Instanced, low end content with upgrades.<br />
<br />
But wait, high ends can get better, so that shouldn't be, right?<br />
<br />
Because non-raiders do not enjoy fucking raiding and even finding 3 groups online is for some a rare sight... So LDoN raids, public raiding and guild alliances are out of the question. Ppl are sick of LDoN for whatever reason, maybe even because dungeons are instanced and offer little social interaction with other players, also sometimes there happen to be more then 5 of my friends online we pretty much never turn anyone down and they come down and we used to split in a group and half or whatever.<br />
<br />
Jesus H. Christ.  <br />
<br />
You are given a dungeon entirely to yourself.  There is no one else there but you and your friends.  You are given free reign, everything that spawns is yours, everything that drops is yours.<br />
<br />
No one else can enter, no one can KS you, no &quot;evil big bad uber high ends&quot; can steal from you...and YOU STILL BITCH.<br />
<br />
What this indicates is that you'll never be happy.  SOE gave you exactly what you wanted and you'll never be happy.<br />
<br />
But there's *still* more out there other than Lost Dungeons of Norrath, you simply refuse to go out there, you refuse to try them, you refuse to do them.<br />
<br />
Sorry, but you don't get to blame high end guilds because for not getting loot or say SOE is spoonfeeding them because you're too chickenshit to try out new expansions.<br />
<br />
You dont understand ppls play styles.<br />
<br />
Nor do you, so what's your point?</div></div><hr />

<br />
BTW my guild doesn't race for spawns EVER.My guild also never takes trivial targets in official raids.Only things we hit are EP's and backflag targets atm.If we log in and fire  is popped we'll hit it,but, we don't play any games with folks and would quit for the night instead.Not all raiders have this foobar'd mentality.So does this make us evil?We had a lot of fun  with Velks ,it was challenging for us and we were just strong enough to group the target rather then raid it.<br />
<br />
Imo content is the problem.Sounds like some servers have too many bored raiders running around.We ran into this too though.Tons of stuff was down and we rarely ever got cursed or aow.Most guilds if they really want it and keep at it will progress though,just like players.</div></div><hr />

Spoken like the true Uberguild assclown.  You also fall into the category of &quot;Completely dependant on your fucking guild,&quot; sir.  If you were ever forced to not be in the raiding game, you'd quit because the alternative is unthinkable, and yet you lecture us on it.<br />

Now there's an excellent idea. Raid targets should never be trivalized by raid progression. I'm sure many people would be pissed by the idea, but no more so than the way vox and naggy is implemented. Single grouping raid targets because your bored only serves to degrade the accomplishments of the very guilds that find the target challenging.</div></div><hr />

There is a VERY limited amount of 65 players willing to raid once you stop counting all the 2 boxed and 3 boxed 65s that are already in these guilds, you make guild leaders dehumanize people once you get some many active people, I would no Joe blow from David O'conner</div></div><hr />

Why would guild run you out of the manor if they want to play in King Tormax's area or the Arena ... ?<br />
<br />
If you were in the arena, then yeah they have to pull vindi, stat, and AoW through there, so they did you a favor in asking you to leave rather than train you.<br />
<br />
No, they PULLED THE FUCKING SEE INVIS GIANTS, THE RESIDENT GIANTS, THE BANK GUARDS....<br />
<br />
THE ENTIRE ZONE JUST ABOUT on us, they wanted us out just because they said the zone was theirs in OOC.<br />
<br />
They didnt have to pull that shit, they didnt need to, not a one of us would have been able to run past the see invis mobs and ninja loot something as SoS didnt exisit at the time.<br />
<br />
The did it because they could, not that they needed to or they should have, this is the problem with ubers that makes a fair amount of them assholes, the have no reserves about how they treat others<br />
<br />
Btw, we were in the zone first, they were intruding on us if anyone was intruding<br />
<br />
Where on earth did you see they asked us to leave? they just came in and said the zone was theirs and trained us, end of story.</div></div><hr />

Eh?<br />
<br />
Pardon me but if people are going to be chickenshits I'm going to say &quot;Hey, you're being a chickenshit&quot; just as easily as Hass is going to call me an assclown.<br />
<br />
<br />
LDoN is fucking clone after clone after clone, 3 differnt damn mobs to kill in each zone, forgive me if i dont jump for joy when this is as creative as fucking killing guards in high hold keep, has a nerfed cash drop rate that is admitted to, slow XP and slow earning of gear.<br />
<br />
 I admit, LDoN was an idea that had merit...that turned out to be rather boring, it was crap in comparison to what they could've done, and I was one of the first to complain about it.<br />
<br />
But don't beg for something like that, endorse it, and then bitch once you have it.<br />
<br />
All throughout this thread, there's people stating: &quot;Why can't there be a zone where we can go where Timeds can't go?&quot;  Guess what, your own exclusive mirj cannot be accessed by any Time geared person in the game.<br />
 <br />
Same with the sewers, except they have repops.<br />
<br />
<br />
Spoken like the true Uberguild assclown. You also fall into the category of &quot;Completely dependant on your fucking guild,&quot; sir. If you were ever forced to not be in the raiding game, you'd quit because the alternative is unthinkable, and yet you lecture us on it.<br />
<br />
Hey Hass.<br />
<br />
I hadn't &quot;been in the raiding game&quot; for quite a while.  If you want to check my applications, I only got into my current guild a month ago.<br />
<br />
Since then I have gotten *zero* loot whatsoever.  I am completely dependent on myself and getting my own loots through outside sources.<br />
<br />
My chestplate was going to rot so I was given it on a Smith Rondo raid before I was guilded.  My bracer came from Jhiru, whom I was present to kill with one group, most of which were not members of the guild I later joined.<br />
<br />
My earrings are from VXed and Barindu, one groupable areas, again most of it was done without the help of my current guild.<br />
<br />
One of my rings is from Lost Dungeons, the other is tradeskilled.<br />
<br />
I wield a crappy Velium Gemmed Dagger (bazaar weapon) and my epic (most easily attained epic in the game).<br />
<br />
All of which was gotten without the aid of my guild.<br />
<br />
I bought my arms, I am currently waiting on a chance to get up to Yelinak to turn in Tormax's Head for a White Dragon Helm, my neck piece came from the Riwwi Coliseum event (can only be done with one group, until then I'd been using Shell Inlaid, a drop off of any thing in Natimbi).  My boots are Lodizal, my hands are Velium Encrusted (Killed Tormax for them with a pick up raid), my cloak is Lodizal.<br />
<br />
I assure you, no &quot;uber guild&quot; gets their members items like this.<br />
<br />
For the past year or so I've been stuck in the casual game, and did I once complain?  Nope.  I said &quot;Oh well, I'll get what I can&quot;.<br />
<br />
So, who's out of grip with reality?  The person who's sour and unwilling to try things, and yet likes to rant about things he doesn't know, or the person who's been through this, and is now raiding?<br />
<br />
Been there, done this, I'm in a new phase of the game that doesn't involve casual play - when I was in the phase that involved casual play, I did Lost Dungeons, I went on pick up raids, I tagged along, I got what the upper guilds didn't want.<br />
<br />
I was damn near Elemental Flagged and certainly content with my character.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry you guys aren't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u220"><b>Grumbam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p220">Actually Gerick I really like the kael example here ... <br />
<br />
Imagine for a minute you had:<br />
<br />
A zone that wasn't instanced<br />
<br />
but was ...<br />
<br />
A Zone that not just anyone could go to<br />
<br />
But was ...<br />
<br />
A zone that in order to access you had to demonstrate that you could cooperate with others.<br />
<br />
and thats ...<br />
<br />
A Locked Zone ...<br />
<br />
<br />
Quests to get into locked zones are a better alternative then just having all zones ( except maybe the topmost raid zone ) open. I don't think they neccessarily Need to be raids only. <br />
<br />
The challenge is to devise a quest that only friendly, sociable, cooperative players could accomplish, those are the only kind of players I would want in my favorite zone. <br />
<br />
The only way I can think of to create a quest then an asshole couldn't do, but a friendly, sociable, cooperative person could would be to require the person doing the quest to have made a whole bunch of friends to help him , sinch who would want to help some fuckholster like those guys in Kael get anyplace. <br />
<br />
Therein lies the problem IMO</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u221"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p221">Problem is fuckholsters get togeather and make their own guild of 72, while guys like me who are making an effort are blocked out purely because of numbers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u222"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p222">It amuses me that when someone contends there's no legitimate reason for a high level player to kill KT and you give them 3, they change the subject.<br />
<br />
People will jump up and down and swear KT is progression content and people are &quot;cockblocking&quot; them if they kill him. But, point out that real progression content like Tower of South Ro is doable and they change the subject. PoP has been out for 2 years and they can't even get themselves flagged for genuine progression content. Don't kill the Armsman in Sebilis Mr. High Level - you'd be &quot;cockblocking&quot; us.<br />
<br />
It's also amusing that some of the same people that complain the loudest about locked zones want zones locked away from high level players.<br />
<br />
Well, y'all needn't worry too much about the likes of me - I may kill KT a couple of times so I can finish my Coldain ring, but in all honesty only my level 52 Pally twink would have any interest in any of the loot that drops there. And truth be told, there's lot's better he can (and probably will) get.<br />
<br />
He's already turned down the quest armor from Kael (who wouldn't), there's lots better Class/Diety and he knows it. Seriously if your 65 main is on my server, you have Thurg faction, and you need that junk give me a /tell - it's been collecting dust in my bank for far too long. Heck, I'll MQ 10 pieces for a single KT faction hit.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u223"><b>Iyacc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p223">why were EPs and other zones then PoTimere locked period is the question? I dont see a reason why wouldnt they unlock everything but time to level 60+ crowd. Please spare me oohhhhh but my guild just did all this work and we are in EPs... Time should be locked behind same flags as it is now, no doubt. There are no other zones in PoP justified to be locked out at all. GoD shouldn't have more then 1 or 2 zones that requiers raid type of flag to zone into either or any other expansion for that matter. Else as been stated by every casual/non-raiding person here, people who do not enjoy raids will leave EQ if havent already.<br />
<br />
<br />
If the EP were unlocked, much of the raid content in them would be potnetially blown 24/7 or wouldn't be doable due to crowding and lag, etc....<br />
<br />
The people that have worked all the flags/raids/etc of Pop have learned what's in every zone to the point they know where you can and can't safely xp, what you can and can't safely kill to not blow earth_ring_01. If you unlocked them and 200 people went in to each zone to xp, it might be possible that noone would ever be able to kill the raid targets or progress past them into Time. <br />
<br />
There's really not much xp space with Fire at a full spawn of named. I'm not sure the zone would be playable with 50 or 60 people in it doing xp and another 50 trying to kill the raid mobs. Half the raid mobs in Fire roam a large portion of the zone which makes that entire area unsafe for the one or two semi-safe xp spots. Two other named are staionary but make an xp spot unsafe. Two named in the second castle, make part of the castle unplayable for xp and if Fennin trugger is up, that makes a very popular xp/kite spot unplayable for the most part. <br />
<br />
Earth rings would be undoable if it was wide open to xp groups for the simple fact that people who don't/can't raid wouldn't care about keeping the triggers dead and the rings blown. Guilds would get blocked from being able to get Earth B flags in a planned manner, which would slow down progression.<br />
<br />
Water is not a real big zone, it's mostly hallways with 15 or so rooms of fish, many of which are yellow and red con. People who don't have raid level gear/stats wouldn't safely be able to do much of this zone, but there are a couple rooms that they could handle. Some of these rooms/areas have a raid named in them though. <br />
<br />
Air probably has some spots you could do xp in and farm tradeskill spots or do some one groupable named. The problem is getting to them would be beyond many groups unless they were used to working together as a team and able to handle mobs that spit, or unmezzables that hit like a truck and stun/spin with a proc, etc.... The one groupable named are easier than much of the content to get TO it, not counting the named Bee that is just past the first island that requires several groups to do for most if not all people. Oh, and the first island is actually one of the more pain in the ass islands. And see invis mobs can roam right down to zone in, making it an unsafe place to even zone in to.<br />
<br />
<br />
Bottom line is they would have to revamp the zones to make them playable as unlocked zones and either move the raid content elsewhere and tone down the zones overall, or leave them as is and only the most adventurous and enterprising of xp groups could even hope to survive, much less be productive.  <br />
<br />
I know a lot of you will say that it should be your decision if the content is too hard and you should have a shot at it. I'm not going to debate that point one way or another, but from someone who's been in EP for a while and spent hundreds and hundreds of hours raiding and doing xp in them, it's just simply not as easy as just unlocking the zones. The zones are not designed for unlimited access.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What I find even more ironic and interesting is the high end raiders who swear up and down that low end raiders and non-raiders should rightfully be locked out of significant amounts of content which effectively restricts large chunks of an expansion to high end raiders only, and then want to trot out justifications for going out and messing with someone else's raid content.  You've got your exclusive content, right?  You have your locked zones, your flag restrictions and content that is more &quot;challenging&quot; because that's what you claim you want.  But you still want to be able to go out and whack the armsman at your leisure while continuing to have all your other perks.<br />

Did this all alone did you?  No guild support?  No massive raiding?  None of that?  Bullshit, we both know better.  As much as you would like to characterize yourself as a self made man, we both know you are as much a construct of your guild as you are of your own efforts.  So to play this &quot;you don't want to put in the time and effort&quot; arguement is pure bullshit.  What you really mean is &quot;you don't want to put in the time and effort in the way I did, being a cog in a raiding machine.&quot;  And that's your justification having it both ways, you raid ergo you are deserving of restricted content and better loot, but you still want to take your overpowered arse into content that is substantially below you and one group boss mobs that could be useful for lower end guilds.  We're not talking taking out trash mobs, we're talking the boss mobs.<br />
<br />
Well, I don't really care what your excuses are.  As far as I'm concerned they could add a routine to every pre-PoP boss mob that ported anyone on it's hate list that had flags greater than say PoJ trials out of the zone.  Hell, I think it would be great if the script included verbage along the lines of, &quot;your power will only be truly tested against the gods of the planes mortal, leave the likes of me alone,&quot; and poof you're ported to PoK.</div></div><hr />

<br />
let me put it a way a fucking blind fool could understand.<br />
<br />
If you play diablo 2 and all the monsters are dead, how would you gain xp and gear to fight the remaining monsters? you can expect to walk over to adnarial or whatever the hell her name is, and win without getting some gear.<br />
<br />
That is the problem we have, your bottom feeding is fucking up OUR progression, the BoC is one of the first, and still regarded as one of the best, hate weapons a player can get, his pants are some of the best in the game, SSra and VT and gods gift to non-visible upgrades.<br />
<br />
If all this content is constantly down by people killing it for fun or to gear up alts to 2 or 3 box with, they are fucking over anyone else trying to get up to your level of play.<br />
<br />
When you guys first went walked the path, it was easyer than when the next group tried and passed into time, and the people that follow them will have it twice as hard.<br />
<br />
Why? because the number of players using the flagging content goes up and there is not enough to go around, this is why alternate paths are needed, and all the gear you need to gear up is also being farmed by people gearing up alts or selling things to yantis so they dont have to have a real job in life.<br />
<br />
We eather need to make flagging monsters instanced or find ways to increase ways for people to get up, for gear up mobs uber people just need to respect the up and coming pu raiders and family guilds instead of beating them into the dirt and spitting on them.<br />
<br />
The reason I talked down to you to start with BB, is that you refuse to admit it may be harder for us to progress then it was for you, so we are not TRUELY following the same path are we? its like you going into the temple of doom before the traps were put in, and calling it a cake walk after they finish it.</div></div><hr />

Everyone who wants to enter them must jump the same hoops to preserve the zone and prevent mudflation and altogether retardation.  If you want in the zone you kill the fucking flag mobs just like every other fucking tool that wastes his/her time on this game (myself included).<br />
<br />
Clear enough for a blind fucking fool yet?<br />
<br />
You can cry all day long that youre in a family guild.  You can cry all day long that jerks cockblock you.  You can cry all day long that you dont find groups and therefore cant gear up.  At the end of the day all you will have is a pile of soggy tissues though as the only other people that give a rats ass are other clowns who expect something for nothing.  Be more competitive of shut the fuck up.  Everyone on every server has to deal with competition ... are you any more special than they are?  Jesus fucking christ you'd swear that the world was out to get you ... if it isn't problem a then it's problem b or c, d ,q , r, t ...  What you fail to realize is that everyone else has to deal with the same shit and they cope.  You accuse BB of not having to deal with these problems ... well think of this before you accuse him of having it easy:<br />
<br />
There are one of 2 possibilities<br />
1. BB was on the premier cutting-edge guild on his server.  They had access to the content first through HARD WORK and TIME INVESTED.  Not only this, but they had no one to hold their hands ... no spoiler infoz on leet strats to kill things.  That's right ... they did it the manly way and beat it all by themselves.<br />
2. Looking at his gear if he isnt on top then he is not far from it.  In this case he is battling not only the highest guild on his server but also the others who are right at his calibur or just behind.  You non-raiders dont know competition like some of the fierce campings and sleepless nights that go with battling multiple guild for spawns and a right to progression.<br />
<br />
But ... wtf does BB know?  <br />
/shrug<br />
<br />
This game has a definitive raiding aspect.  It always has and it always will.  There are other choices of gameplay style, but they wont result in the same rewards or progression.  Your choice to not raid or not join a raiding guild is precisely that ... your choice.</div></div><hr />

Honestly i think people are just using it as an excuse to whine.<br />
<br />
Viva la page 100!<br />
<br />
<br />
Sure, let me just make a check out to yantis asshole, I'm sure he loves people like you who farm ornate for him, AND premotes his little job.<br />
<br />
&quot;But once again, this just goes to show that you dont have a clue what you are talking about.&quot;<br />
<br />
And you sir, know jack shit about casuals and non raiders so we are even!<br />
<br />
Glad my comment made you laugh, OoW isnt even out yet so how can its content be buggy? is that the 3rd or 4th time reading comprehension was slipped past you?<br />
<br />
something that would take more then 10k to find a = item from? velious skyshrine warrior arms are a hard thing to beat until you farm the reluctant gladitor in GoD (which i am doing, i am NOT lazy)<br />
<br />
you dont need to come up with a defense for those guilds until you qoute the right part of my post. (the crag beast comment is what your looking for  :p )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u239"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p239">I'm a casual officer in a casual guild that takes things at a casual pace.  I am not a hardcore cutting-edge raider nor do i presume to be.  I do, however, take the time to educate myself before trying to have a discussion about it on a public board.   This is why it gets my knickers in a twist to watch other &quot;casuals&quot; bitch and moan about Everquest and the devs being out to get them.  There are paths available.<br />
<br />
The OoW comment stemmed from the GoD complaints from highend guilds about bugged content i presumed .. but i guess i gave you more credit than was due.  For a second there i actually thought you were being witty and for that I apologize.<br />
<br />
You are disgruntled and point the finger at anything/everything possible except the one thing that is really holding you back ... yourself.  You have 2 options available for progression yet you capitalize on neither.  You dont want to join a raiding guild (which is fine).  Your other option is to capitalize on LDoN, plat farming (just like the rest of us), the bazaar, and other 1 groupable fun stuffs for upgrades.  There is a clear path from 5-7k as a warrior ... you just dont want to invest the time into it.  After all, it is much easier to point the finger elsewhere than to take responsibility for your own shortcomings.<br />
<br />
Velious skyshrine armor is decimated by:<br />
Ornate Plate Arms<br />
Pitted Vambraces (sewer trial easy stuff .. check my magelo)<br />
LDoN Arms ...<br />
<br />
You can have these any day of the week with a spot of work.  <br />

Cheers!</div></div><hr />

Your a guild raider, not the best but still a guild raider.<br />
<br />
Tell me how I hold myself back? I lead pickup raiders on xanamech to win the hammer sooner or later.<br />
<br />
My guild and I are always trying harder content<br />
<br />
I've explored riwwi and gotten 2 upgrades and have my sights set on many more, and ferubi<br />
<br />
I do LDoN any time I can, I do BoT any time I can for ornate<br />
<br />
I bitch because I am sick of all this shit rolling downhill on us, while some people have the balls to tell us we should pick thru their crap to try to locate a gold nugget that isnt there.<br />
<br />
I bitch because I am sick of how the game has gone from being casual, to half and half, to almost all about raiding.<br />
<br />
I bitch because I am getting to where I almost want to quit, I am on the brink of going the way of haass and the others that still hold a thread of hope for this, the DKP list seems promissing and my best chance of me further gearing up to take my guild into more places<br />
<br />
I bitch because I want to see some damn change, and you should too.<br />
<br />
We both know this game has ALOT of room to improve but many people dont want improvements that dont suit them because they would rather the devs spent their time elsewhere on their concerns.<br />
<br />
Ornate Plate Arms (60k on my server, the best thing I can solo are the shades in TS and sell stacks of shadows for 500p, this takes an hour a stack and 30 min waiting on repops, that is 3 hours for 1k so 180 hours for ornate, or i can wait for the named in BoT to pop 6 hours at a time, only see it drop half the time and have to roll it)<br />
Pitted Vambraces (sewer trial easy stuff .. check my magelo) (sewer trial easy? bullshit)<br />
LDoN Arms ...(hmm 40 hours for them, 20-30 to augment them, so 70 hours.... almost as bad as farming shadows)<br />
<br />
I will just keep going after the reluctant gladitor... oh wait, some time geared shithead is farming ! well fuck me!<br />
<br />
It is far far from a walk in the park, I am sick of the best option being that I buy plat from some shithead who has reportedly made over 2 mil, I am also sick of people like you who think everything is easy and a walk in the park your guild carrys your ass and sucks up because your an officer, I am sure half the help you got for your upgrades were people trying to gain your favor.<br />

You silly silly little fool.  Killing AoWar takes what ... 4groups these days?  My guild actually killed him a few times with ~36 when we got lucky and he was up.  The rest of my gear is nodrop or comes from Hard LDoN there fuckstick.  Take your half asses accusations elsewhere.  Just because you dont take the time to better yourself doesnt mean others can't and don't.<br />
<br />
40 hours for VT/EP quality arms?  I'd say thats a fucking bargain and a half.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u242"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p242">Btw, let me add that by the time I spend my time to upgrade everything in LDoN I will have probibly trippled my playing time logged... that isnt my idea of fun or fair, the same cloned zones taking up as much time combined as my 3 and a half years playing?<br />
<br />
4 groups my fucking ass, it took us 35 to kill vindi.<br />
<br />
Just goes to show how good your guild really is, you can stop lying and saying your casual any time now, the very fact you farmed him to sell the BoC shows how much of a jackass you are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u243"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p243">We can kill vindi with 2 groups ... cakewalk.  Then again our players capitalize on LDoN and actually work at bettring themselves.  <br />
<br />
FYI we've had 4 BoC's and 2 RZ helms drop and they all reside in the hands of our resident warriors for active use.  Once again ... chill with false accusations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u244"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p244">So do I, you just ignore that.<br />

Repeating yourself doesnt make it true.<br />

I know a EP guild that farmed vindi so my brother could have his bp since they were friends they gave him a hand, it took them 2 groups.<br />

you where the one who choose to imply that those items had helped with your buyable gear, excuse me for not reaching out across space and time to read your mind. guess you just mean since you had them.<br />
<br />
If you kill AoW your guild is now a progression guild, not casual</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u245"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p245">If you kill AoW your guild is now a progression guild, not casual<br />
<br />
Says who?  ... by your reasoning if a guild can kill things and progress it isnt casual?  We are a family guild who happens to be able to do things.  Raid attendance is not mandatory ... real life always comes first for us and consequently we are forced to do more with less.  Our first kill of grummus was with 34 ... our first AoWar with 33 ... Terris with 40 for the first time and Saryrn with 45.  We 1-group Vallon Zek etc yadda yadda.<br />
<br />
Just because you're strong doesnt mean youre not casual.  If youre implying that anyone who is progressing is not casual then that means that YOU sir are not casual either, and neither is anyone who is posting on these boards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u246"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p246">If you can kill AoW with that number of people then you can handle VT, SSra, and many others, after farming VT and SSra you just about ready for EP.<br />
<br />
That is 2 zone you have to master to be ep, that isnt all that much in the scope of it all.<br />
<br />
My assertion about relative power comes from one of many charts placing big name boss mobs into sets of 10, AoW is about a 6, VT and SSra are 7, EP and several of the planer events just under the EP level are 8, time is 9 and the hardest GoD monsters are 10.<br />
<br />
(vindi would be 5, some kunark dragons would be 4 and 3 for compairison)<br />
<br />
Anyhow are you not tired of this thread yet? 496 posts     :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u247"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p247">We refuse to do VT because we are a casual guild whose members cannot invest a months time farming keys.  <br />
<br />
Funny thing is our LDoN and GoD 1 groupable stuff gotten the casual way will allow us to enter and be successful in EP without VT or SSRA.  Don't give me advice on how to lead a guild through content as i know what is needed.  As is we have killed everything except RZ as a guild and he will fall soon ... all of this done with only having raided XTC once, HP once ... and never setting foot inside VT.<br />
<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1072786<br />
<br />
Everything in this magelo can be gotten with 1 group ... some of the loot from named but most from steenky old ldon.  This is what you should concentrate on rather than arguing on this board.<br />
<br />
<br />
If your chart says AoWar is a 6 ... then some Pre-Ep content should be a 12 ... all EP content should be over 15 ... time over 20 and GoD hardest pushing 25.<br />

ps- yes i'm an officer</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u248"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p248">Didnt you say you were an officer</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u249"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p249">I wanted to make a couple of clarifications since there was speculation.<br />
<br />
If one goes by server firsts, I'm in the #2 guild on my server. The #1 guild is Dark Horizon. Although there was at one time plenty of racing, &quot;cockblocking&quot;, leapfrogging, and general futzing around, it was in the very very distant past on my server. Both DH and my guild have a longstanding reputation for fair play.<br />
<br />
However, every guld I know of raced to kill AoW, KT, the dragons for ST keys, to clear ST, Lodi, the dragon that drops the Green Scale, Ragefire, the Royals, Dain, Ssra named, Seru, etc. etc. etc.<br />
<br />
I'd like to point out that KT is not level 65. Kael in general is waaay pre-60. I believe I first did it at around level 50 and first attempted KT by level 55. So, the complaintent was bottom feeding. Should he not be chidded if he needs the drops to wear (giggle)? He doesn't - Class Diety armor alone is generally superior, besides he's farming Ornate molds in BoT.<br />
<br />
And there's the thing I find objectionable. Like those Paladins that outright asked Defensive to be turned off whenever it's not used to MT an &quot;appropriate&quot; raid mob - some of the posters here have asked for a nerf. Prevent &quot;high-level&quot; players from bottom feeding. Of course when those level 65's bottom feed low level zones, that's entirely different. If we aren't going to get Defensive, the Warrior class defining ability, then nerf Warriors. If we can't enter zones that you can enter because of the MERIT system EQ has had in place for a number of years, why then you should be locked out of zones too. Lock those ubers out of zones, nerf those dastardly Warriors.<br />
<br />
I'd like to see SoE provide a non-progression flag quest for Tower of South Ro. I think it would help non-hard core players a lot. However, there are a few posters in this thread that I'd like to see encounter Quarm each and every time they zoned in. It wouldn't be faaaaaaiiiiir it they missed out on seeing the endgame mob in PoP.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u250"><b>Adarian Silverthorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p250">Some of you are mistaken in your continuous spouting of the time=work thing.<br />
The real equation is (Time X Difficulty)=work<br />
<br />
That means that someone who plays 7 hours a day but only does LDoN/BoT/Tactics that they can't possibly fail at anymore unless server goes down or lots go LD, is not equal to the work of a person who has spent that same time raiding up to GoD content and finishing PoP content simply due ot the difficulty of doing so. <br />
<br />
You can not tell me that doing LDoN or xp in BoT is as tuff as dying over and over again trying to learn and win fights like RZ, Zegony, Coirnav, Rathe, all Time content, Ikk 4, Uqua etc.</div></div><hr />
