<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Slovack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, i dont know if this is the place to put this thread but i thought it was the best fit for the topic.<br />
Heres my question...<br />
We did the Caprin cycle in CoD, then killed Bertox. I got the &quot;you have recieved a character flag&quot; from hailing the pussling after Caprin and after hailing the planer projection from Bertox. So i go to Alder Fursteil next to PoD and hail him and say &quot;what ward&quot; then i went to Elder Fursteil in the sickbay and hailed him, i got the &quot;you have recieved a character flag&quot; text again. Then i hailed Fahlia Shadyglade and told her &quot;i will go to torment&quot;. but she said something to the effect of to leave, or im not ready?<br />
<br />
Anyways, did i get flaged from Bertox or not? The reason im asking is because the little gnome in PoK wont give me an AA?<br />
<br />
Hell im confused, when flagging is done out of order it can really be a bitz!<br />
<br />
Any help would be cool</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>omgmise</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">As long as you got your hails in , you have the flags, although you may need to do some work hailing the seer, and other npcs to fix them.  As far as the aa goes, Bertox is a checklist flag for solro access.  It doesnt open up a new zone for you, so you do not get an AA for it.  Hope that helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Derrict</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Fahlia is for the keeper / saryrn line of flags. You will need that phrase after you kill Saryrn iirc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Slovack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks guys, i was kind of thinking along those lines. I'll make sure everything is cosher with the Seer, then im gtg as far as Bertox goes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I believe Fahlia will only speak to you after you have resolved both the Bertox and TT line of flags (including post-hailings for each).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lessiter1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Probably need hedge or TT.. go hail Elder Poxbourne in the sickbay.  If you get a character flag from hailing him, your flags for hedge/tt are finished.  <br />
<br />
If you don't get a character flag from simply hailing Poxbourne, you need either TT or hedge.<br />
<br />
You can't get the KoS/Saryrn preflag without those 2</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shaiel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The &quot;what ward&quot; from the guy outside of PoD is something you're supposed to do before Grummus.  You might have some unlocking to do with the seer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Slovack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've done TT/Hedge and Grummus and have said &quot;what ward&quot; to the guy outside PoD. i think all i have to do is some work with the Seer  :confused:</div></div><hr />
