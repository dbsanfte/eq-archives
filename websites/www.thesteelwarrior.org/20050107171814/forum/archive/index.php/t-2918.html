<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daramin</div><div class="date">09-08-2003, 03:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Today my guild was killing Vallon Zek and while we were on the 2nd wave or so, another guild started the RZtW script. The 2nd wave proceeded normally, then the third waved popped and that went normally too. However, when the third wave was dead, there was no 4th wave. We never got the real Vallon.<br />
<br />
At the same time Tallon was up, and stayed up through the entire time, up to and including past this guild failing on either fake or real RZ.<br />
<br />
Several other guilds on the server have told us that VZ &quot;depopped&quot; basically -- ie that because the fake VZ is involved in the RZtW script, we got hosed on the real VZ event. However I'm unclear how this could be the case given that the real TZ stayed up the whole time.<br />
<br />
Can anyone shed some light on what happened? I want to make sure we know what the deal is so it doesn't happen again, or if it does we can at least warn other guilds beforehand. The leadership of the other guild said they had nothing to do with our VZ bug, and everything I know about them says that they're not lying to us, although they may have simply been ignorant of what the deal is.</div></div><hr />

Sounds to me like your vz just got bugged - stuff like that happens all the time in pop, i've seen numerous instances of mobs just not popping when they were supposed to during events, etc.</div></div><hr />

And it won't be the last, I've seen bugged Saryrn (no bird), bugged RZ, bugged Avatars in PoAir (not spawning after killing trigger), bugged PoEarth rings (trigger mobs despawning)... You just have to suck it up and go find something else to kill hehe</div></div><hr />

Second time we did the first two waves but no third wave.  There was also no one doing RZ at the time, so i don't think it's that.  Probably just sony messin up another event.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">09-08-2003, 07:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Same thing happened on TM a few nights ago.  VZ despawned after the third wave.  No one was doing Rallos at the time so I imagine it was just a bug.</div></div><hr />
