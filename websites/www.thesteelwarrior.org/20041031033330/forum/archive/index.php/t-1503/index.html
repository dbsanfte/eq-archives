Bloodfrenzy &gt; Hategiver &gt; BoC?<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Slammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Blood 1st, Boc,2 and hategiver 3, I have not used a blood, or hate giver my i have seen our Tanks use a BOC and blood combo awesome agro they get. Some im basing this on what i have SEEN..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fatz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'd prefer a Hategiver over a BoC myself but that's probably cause I have a Hategiver and no BoC :P But from what i've heard, the BoC has a pretty shitty proc rate and the 25ac on the Hategiver is well worth the 15hp loss IMO. Oh and of course the Bloodfrenzy is &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; either of the other two.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>thundersam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Id say Bf&gt;Hate&gt; boc, 15 hp is nothing to 25 ac and better svs, the hategiver has also better procrate atleast after my experiences.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Daemonwynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">BF&gt; Hategiver &gt;Boc</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Valnir Lanys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Definately BF &gt; HG &gt; BoC</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>zaos13</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i prefer BoC only for the fact that the other 2 are no drop. Currently we have:<br />
1 BF (not lucky with cursed =( everytime we don't get him it drops)<br />
1 Privatly owned BoC<br />
3 Guild BoCs<br />
<br />
Tank with the BF is moving right now<br />
tank with the privatly owned BoC is moving right now<br />
Tank with one guild boc is like a blue moon<br />
i have a guild boc<br />
BoC in bank<br />
So basicly right now we are down to the bank one and mine, Emp kill yesterday was...interesting =)<br />
<br />
Anyway....BoC is really nice cause its dropable EB  that can be stored with a officer...<br />
<br />
edit add, i'm not a moron i know BF is the best, just argueing the fact that 25 AC is pointless with HG vs. BoC if the HG person is offline.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gnomb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Still dreaming about a hategiver/bloodfrenzy combo.<br />
The only one in guild who sometimes grabs agro when i tank seems to be the warrior using hategiver/obsidian scimitar (off VZ) -  dont ask why he is using them even when not assigned SA...<br />
Seems to proc quite often.<br />
Personally i'd say grab what you can, unless your guild is the only one in ssra (VERY unlikely) your chances are probably limited to see several of either one drop.<br />
From what i heard bloodfrenzy drops about 1 out of 30 kills (we were more than lucky getting 2 on 6 or so cursed kills.<br />
Only seen one hategiver drop out of 10+ xtc kills.<br />
If your guild can do AoW thats probably the best chance to see a EB weapon drop as his loot table is rather small and 2 BoC's dropping is not that rare (another guild got 3 once).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">BoC is only common eb you will see atm, get one. HG and BF are rare drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Valnir Lanys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Gnomb don't loot a Bloodfrenzy and a Hategiver both.  I have both and wish I had never looted my Hategiver.  The bloodfrenzy is enough aggro alone and you'll want an offhand other than EB unless you REALLY need to lock aggro down, in which case you can just go get a BoC from AoW late at night or something.  My Hategiver essentially dosn't see any action these days. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Brokkah Narrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">First AoW kill had a BoC<br />
First Cursed had a Bloodfrenzy<br />
First XTC had a Hategiver<br />
<br />
Only seen 1 BoC since though..<br />
<br />
Since I was first in my guild to get a CHSD I've not got EB yet, but I'm praying a BF drops before either of the other 2 so I can grab it, although whatever we get first I will use :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Taelen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">My HG procs way more than the BoC Korinn.  Tried and tested. :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Bloodheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">In my experience, proc rate on BoC is terrible. Thank god for BBoE :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gnomb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Lol, on our last Cursed cycle BBotE rotted as noone wanted to spend dkp on it (3 warriors, 2 with BF/BoC and other with BoC/Agnarr 1hs).<br />
And i agree, most likely one of our other warriors will grab next EB weapon that drops, we have currently 6 active warriors, 2 with dual EB weapons and the other ones with one and decent offhanders.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Smakz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">my BoC &gt; Fatz hategiver ... just cause its mine. :)<br />
