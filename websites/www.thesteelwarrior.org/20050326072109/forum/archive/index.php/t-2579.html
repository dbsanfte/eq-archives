<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Esvee</div><div class="date">08-16-2003, 10:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all,<br />
<br />
Last night our guild managed to kill Lendinaria the keeper for the first time. This was probably the hardest fight we ve faced yet as he seemed to have never-ending hp. Clerics for the most part were oom by the end of it, especially as we got an add. <br />
<br />
Guild at the moment is allmost completely comprised of lvl 55-65 toons, with the majority above 60. Most have SS armor or Kael armor and I d say most melee are still equipped with droppable weapons or epics. We got Kland and Vindi to drop ST key parts yesterday too, so we seem to be slowly moving in that direction. <br />
<br />
At the moment we can drop Vindi, Xanemech or similar mobs without too much trouble. We ve done Itraer Vius a few times too. Velious dragons seem a bit hard still. <br />
<br />
My question now is wether it would be worth it for us to ruin our CoV faction and head into NToV or just build up towards ST and get to work in Ssra? I have no idea on the difficulty of NToV mobs so it would be nice to know how they compare to Lend. I imagine we would be able to kill the SoRZ but not the AoW yet. BoT tower may also be an option as more people pass lvl 62.<br />

<br />
NToV named are a great way to gear up a guild... if the place is full, you can kill 5-7 named in a single raid and all of them will drop several pieces of loot.<br />
<br />
NToV also exposes you to some new encounter styles... ae mana drains, flurry drakes, ae knockbacks, etc...<br />
<br />
As for difficulty, I think the NToV named are a bit harder than LtK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fenring</div><div class="date">08-16-2003, 10:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In NTov for the first time this weekend and I have to agree with Sangiovese, it is very good training and so far nice loot.<br />
<br />
If you're doing Klandi, Vindi etc you should be able to take those BoT bosses too it will just take a couple tries to get the strategy down. SoRZ is weaker than vindi IMO so you can do him too just a little harder to find up. Tormax, Yelinak, Sontalak and Dain could also be possible targets for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">08-16-2003, 10:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another thing to consider is that Ssra is probably highly contested and if you try to go there with a bunch of inexperienced mid-50s you are gonna get rolled over by bigger more powerful guilds.  Also if you thought Lend was challenging, then anything in Ssra other than rhag 1/2 is probably gonna cream you.  NToV is a lot of fun, certainly more fun than Ssra and VT so I say go for it.  CoV faction isn't worth much, and switching faction is a pain, but it's very doable and it's worth it for something like a doze quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kendolekk</div><div class="date">08-16-2003, 01:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No one should skip NToV. Ever.<br />

<br />
Avatar weapons knock precious seconds off your boss mob fights too, so consider the benefits of ST. <br />
<br />
Personally, once your guild has a reasonable amount of velious armour I'd forget faction and just kill whatever you can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">08-16-2003, 03:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally, once your guild has a reasonable amount of velious armour I'd forget faction and just kill whatever you can. <br />
<br />
Spoken like a true wise man.<br />
<br />
The thing with NToV is that it doesn't take very many runs to gear your guild up.  There is a TON of droppable loot.  A lot of the gear is only average when you first look at it, but spreading lots of average to above average gear around a guild that's equipped with below average crap is a considerable power upgrade.  Then there are the really awesome drops that come out of NToV that make it all worth it, like Blackstar, Gaudralek, Cloak of Thorns, Onyx Gauntlets, etc.  <br />
<br />
As far as difficulty goes, dragons in NToV can vary in difficulty compaired to Len.  If you had problems with him, then Aaryonar, Lady Nev, Lord Vyemm, Zlexak (Hoshkar 2.0), and Dagarn will give you trouble.  Being that most of the dragons are permarooted, however, they're fairly straight forward fights after you figure out where to position what classes.  They just become endurance matches after that.<br />
<br />
Also, if you never make the switch over to giant faction, you'll be missing out on two high prized and awesome pieces of loot in the game:  Belt of Dwarf Slaying and Gauntlets of Dragon Slaying.  Farming Yeli takes a bit more time than farming Dain does since Dain is spawned every time someone does the Shawl/Ring quest, I think.  I participated in five Dain kills in one week before.  Both always drop their head.<br />
<br />
The 425 Dain also drops the Frostreaver.   That's a hella nice agro weapon. :)</div></div><hr />

Kill, die, farm, enjoy it.  I really enjoy NToV because we get to kill mobs that were increidbly evil when I first started playing, and they drop loot that is still good.<br />
<br />
Also, raiding to clear NToV is a lesson in raiding.  Not only in tactics, but time management, as well as bio management.  Some raids take all day to get on and do, and clearning all of NToV will help you learn how to deal with that.<br />
<br />
NToV is a blast, go for it!  You don't know how you will do until you run up and die, rez and fight again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just wondering, cuz' if it's possible to pull mobs to the front like a HoT entrance camp, then I might give it a try, but having a huge cr just to test our strength seems a bit much for me.<br />
<br />
Thank all.<br />
<br />
Course, I could just run in myself and find out. :)<br />

I do agree with everyone that pound for pound NToV is some of the best stuff a guild can do for many of the above mentioned reasons and the not yet mentioned 41% haste items =)<br />
As for not wanting to risk a CR in there just have either a Necro with a Velious quest robe (Thurg,SS,Kael I believe all have the clicky summon spell) or a SoS Rogue. I can speak from expierience that my SoS rogue can wander and CR thru all of NToV with little to no danger.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Surlok</div><div class="date">08-17-2003, 12:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">NToV requires moving thru the zone, there is no pulling to one place <br />
<br />
There is Several Camps in NtoV where yo ucan pull to.<br />
<br />
The first camp most guilds use will be Roys hallway should they havea coth mage,which if your guild can should be a high priority it will save tons of time.,First cothing to top of Ramp clearing the chickens out,After that people often camp at Roys stairs and pull everything for Eashen/ITV to there.<br />
<br />
Then it is back to ramp for roy.<br />
<br />
Then it is roys pit,Where if it is a full spawn you will pull several Named Flurries,or otherwise normal drakes with the odd flurrie thrown in.If you are going Fesh route you can pull everything up to his guards to here.<br />
<br />
If you are going Vyemm it is often better to pull the left side a bit till you can pull His guards sans adds.<br />
<br />
Eashens Ramp and Roys pit are the 2 places where I have always spent the most time while I was there.The rest of the dungeon is basically a crawl,though after Lady M you will hang out a bit and a good deal of time is usualyl spent around Kriezens lair.<br />
<br />
You will learn about all kinds of AE's.how to Hide Casters,How to time AE's and move in and out for them,Learning Flurries,and dealing with several high dps mobs in camp.Learning how to work with other tanks on mobs,If you are unlucky you will end up with alot of Flurries sometimes and in my opinion clearing them is often more difficult than the actual boss fights should you get mroe than one on a pull.The spam is remarkable,especially when you have 3 or 4 in camp.<br />
<br />
Gaters are pure hell for that =P<br />
<br />
But the loot is great,Flurries drop great Melee Necks and Caster Shields,Most every Dragon has a couple pieces of great loot and some are just shit.Things will rot but there is so much quality gear there at the same time.</div></div><hr />

If these people are actually in need of NTOV gear, then no.  You'll need enough healers to perform a healing rotation, probably 3 depending on your tank.  And you'll need more damage: a single wizard with dragonbane, or ranger with elemental bow, might be enough.  A bard with AE resists/mana/regen would make a huge difference with a small force, too.<br />
<br />
Basically, if you are able to kill flurry drakes or Eashen/Ikatiar without deaths, then you are ready to try dragons in NTOV.  So my advice is to find a night where Aaryonar is dead, go to his pit, and see how you fare against the flurry drakes that roam NTOV.  Or if Eashen/Ikatiar are up, then try them.  Your ability to even pull these mobs will be part of the indicator of your readiness.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">08-18-2003, 12:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think that if you are new to NToV you should bring at least 4 good groups the first time you go there.  If your guild can kill the WToV dragons, including the keeper, pretty easily then you are probably ready for NToV.  The WToV dragons are easier to practice on because if you have a non-kos mage you can just CoH to the spot and dont have to worry about pulling them and such</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">08-18-2003, 03:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That group could do NToV if they were in elemental armor hehe, if you're wearing Skyshrine armor and epics I don't think so.  <br />
<br />
I would echo what Eriatha said about BoDS/GoDS.  Those are two awesome items for pretty much everyone in your guild.  You won't replace either of them until Vex Thal at the earliest, and a lot of people are wearing them in the elemental planes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vigdis SangCaru</div><div class="date">08-18-2003, 07:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As a general rule I'd say that all the previous posters are right.  You will want to try NTOV in order to stretch your raid experience, take on new encounters and gear up your people.<br />
<br />
I do think, however, that with the advent of POP you have alternative paths available to you.  For example, you no longer need the speed items as you can pretty easily upgrade from Xanamech.  You can also get items from the POS mini and uppers.  If you are capable of doing Xanamech, I suspect you are capable of at least doing Auflie and Einride and probably all the tower bosses in BOT, all of which will drop good upgradeable stuff that fills many of the slots otherwise upgraded in NTOV.  And if you work within the confines of POP (kicking in Vindi, IV, THO, Burrower, RC, Servitor, Korocust, DS, etc) you can basically skip NTOV entirely.  In addition, since many of these encounters have &quot;tricks&quot;, AEs, etc., you really don't lose much in raid skill experience.<br />
<br />
So, in short, I think its up to you and your guild.  If your guild will actively pursue and track the mobs in POP, Luclin, Velious, I'd think you can just leave NTOV.  But it is a lot easier and more satisfactory to upgrade a bunch of folks in 6 hours in NTOV than many days elsewhere.<br />
<br />
And in the end, I'd never make a decision based upon faction.  When I joined my guild they managed to trash every single one of my Velious factions within about a week.  It is the individual raidmember's responsibility to raise faction when needed (and its damn easy!) - let the guild gank any damn Velious mob it wants because ultimately spreading the love is a good way to upgrade everyone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Naralli_VoLS</div><div class="date">08-19-2003, 10:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Re: NToV.<br />
<br />
I am going to echo pretty well everyone else here. It is well worth it to go here and try this out. Lots of gear upgrades, lots of tactics required and killing dragons is fun.<br />
Good practice for this is Clearing all the mobs from the zone in through the &quot;Hub&quot; to the NToV doors. Many NToV capable guilds find clearing all of that harder than the actual NToV area. And if you intend on destroying CoV faction ( which you will do in a single NToV run ) you will have to clear all those mobs each and every time you do NToV anyways. <br />
I also agree that there is ALOT of loot off other sources in this game that would make it possible for any guild to bypass NToV entirely. Many of the Luclin Boss types have way better gear drops. Of course, the difficulty of the Luclin boss types is significantly higher as well. The thing that NToV has them beat on is that it has Many Mobs that drop good loot upgrades all in One location. You will get 15-20 drops in one NToV raid and maybe 1-3 drops in a Luclin boss raid. cant beat that. :)<br />
<br />
re: ST<br />
I am torn on this zone with the exception of the weapons. The loot only drops off the named Golems ( 3 of them ) so at best you will get from 3-6 Prismatic weapons. It takes clearing a &quot;billion&quot; mobs to get all 3 named Golems. The last Golem is at the very bottem of ST in front of the gate to the Ancients. It takes a long time to move a raid down all those tunnels killing hundreds of drakes along the way. It is a Pain in the arse to be honest for a couple of weapons. Also consider that CR's in here are difficult as dragging takes forever due to length of the corridor lower in, as well you cant drag at all from the last Golem camp as it is after the drop off. Therefore dying at the bottom = raid end as you will have to summon all the bodies and it takes to long to get all the way back down unless you intend on leaving a mage down there for CoH. Therefore you must look seriously at what the weapons do for you as a guild to see if Keying up 16-20+ people for a serious shot at taking down the 3 Mobs in ST is worth the effort.<br />
The weapons are all of reasonable damage delay, and still hold up well to todays ratios. proc is Avatar which is 100 str, 100 dex, 100 agi, and 100 atk. This is a significant buff for free off a weapon. I find I equip my Ancient Prismatic warsword for the proc, then swap it out for another weapon. The buff in turn makes me do more damage, proc more often ( from 100 dex ).<br />
Beyond the golems I am uncertain if tackling the ancients is worth it, as I have yet to see any loot from them that makes me want to go there over NToV, BoT, any of the Luclin Bosses, etc.<br />
Is ST worth it?..I am unsure.<br />

While the Xanamech neck is a viable alternative to Gauntlets of Dragon Slaying, just remember that Woven Shim Choker (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=16477) is not always a guarunteed drop.  While I would still encourage guilds to kill Xanamech for it, I would not rely on just killing Xanamech to equip your guild with 41% haste items.  <br />

If you do Vindicator, you can at least do Ikatiar and Eashen.<br />
Those can be pulled into the lower corners of &quot;The Hub&quot; if you want to (or even to entrance... gets you odd looks from bystanders though).<br />
<br />
Aaryonar is all about timing. You'll fight her at a corner to hide the casters preferrably (manadrain dot).<br />
<br />
Flurry drakes could kick any named dragon's ass in NToV, except vulak ring maybe :p they HURT!<br />
<br />
Feshlak, Kreizenn, Vyemm, Mirenilla (sp), Nevderia are rooted.<br />
Aaryonar, Dagarn, Koi'Doken, Jorlleag, Zlexak, Sevalak and Cwhateverak are not.<br />
<br />
You'll learn to have long endurance fights (nevderia with skeleton crew at 2 AM anyone?), and you'll have fast burst fights (hi zlexak. that ass never gave me a bracer :()<br />
You'll have to deal with silence, stuns, knockbacks, multi-flurry-inc (ouch), gating mobs, gating flurrys (very ouch).<br />
<br />
Your guild as a whole will improve from this. Don't miss it.<br />
And, it looks kickass.<br />
<br />
<br />
ST:<br />
get primals if you can. not only the buff kicks ass, for many of your melees the weapons might still be upgrades (not sure with all that droppable PoP stuff around).<br />
Further, the Ancients around sleeper bubble drop loot that is about NToV quality, for example a 100hp 39% haste robe for mnk/bst, a dwarf illusion mask, some caster stuff like shields or boots or shoulders, which will still be upgrades for some people.<br />
<br />
Don't miss out on this zone. Key up your guild. Do a full crawl.<br />
It's so worth it. The feeling of the zone overall is amazing.<br />
(hint: don't talk to the gnome in the library unless you're prepared).<br />

Flurry is an ability that some melee mobs have where they execute 4 simultaneous attacks on their target. The massive amounts of damage these mobs can muster make them very challenging. The Flurry wyverns and flurry drakes in Ntov can easily put down a MT in seconds.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">08-21-2003, 11:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe flurry is an extra set of main-hand attacks.  So potentially, a mob can swing 3 (mainhand) + 2 (offhand) + 3 (flurry) = 8 times in a single round, plus perhaps a bash as well.<br />
<br />
Of course, they'll miss a lot of those attacks, and their chances of actually making 8 attempts in a given round is low, but you'll see lots of 5 and 6 attack rounds with mobs like these.  When they hit for 700, and have a delay of about 1 second, like those flurry drakes do, they can still put a world of hurt on an 8k tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">08-21-2003, 12:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I love these 2 zones. Very high up there on the bank-for-the-buck scale. Both are considerably easier now with AAs and level 65. Like several others have said, NToV is a great training ground for teaching a guild raid skills. You will learn positioning, AE avoidance, multi-tanking, pulling, dealing with gaters, and marathon fights.<br />
<br />
I still farm ToV (not enough ST keys for pick up farming these days) and its a blast. I would recommend taking a full raid force if your guild is still getting their feet wet raiding. When I've farmed with my guildies, we have taken everything up to Vyemm with under 3 groups pretty easily, but that was with elem geared people. I have also done LtK, Telk, Ikky, and Eash with as few as 13-18 ornate+cultural+lower end PoP geared people. The fights where long, but they where a ton of fun.<br />

For a guild at this level, NToV is the best and fastest way to gear up. There are a lot of items with great stats and 75 or more mana/hp. A lot of these items will last well into VT/PoP.</div></div><hr />

if you got a nonkos mage with some balls at least, they can run to aary coth spot (hatchling corner at aary hallway) and coth FD classes and rogues first, then some invis clerics and slowers, then while you clear chickens just coth up the rest. i liked it better to pull to aary hallway really.</div></div><hr />
