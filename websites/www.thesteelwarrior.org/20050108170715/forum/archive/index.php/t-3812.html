For VT, a few good monks are essential as well as some SoS rogues for dragging.  Other than that, a couple good tanks plus healers and dps should be fine.<br />

Have fun clearing :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">10-22-2003, 06:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">depending on gear and DETERMINATION VT can be cleared by 20-30 ppl will take forever but doable. All boss mobs are total pamsy. The hardest of them can be done with 3-4 groups its the clearing that gets you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crystara</div><div class="date">10-22-2003, 08:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">TVK repops would likely slaughter you before killing him on under 30, the rest should all be doable though on those numbers if you like tedious trash clearing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">10-22-2003, 08:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guild did VT for the first time this weekend.   With ~40 people (only a few who had ever been to VT before) we were able to clear all the bosses except for the north guy on the 2nd floor in 2 days.  The bosses themselves are pure weaksauce, the hardest part is killing the huge trains of 4 arms and robes while clearing to the bosses.  Basicaly if you can kill the emperor then none of the bosses in VT should worry you at all.  Most of them melee like Idol of RZ, are slowable, and a few have short range silence or grav flux AoE spells.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ronaan</div><div class="date">10-23-2003, 03:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">shouldn't do much more than palace key (the big stone dude in the courtyard) and maybe TVX's until the majority of your guild had a chance at rifts or they will feel left out.<br />
<br />
after that, you'll have big attendance at first and notice less and less over time because VT seems to be boring to some people. won't matter though, your gear upgrades should compensate that ;)</div></div><hr />

I know there are 9 items you have to get to get into VT but anyone have a link to specifics on the mobs and zones that drop the items for the VT key?<br />

10 shards, 1 orb of lucinite, 1 planar rift, 1 scepter frame.</div></div><hr />

Hit everquest.allakhazam.com.   Here's the basics on whatcha need, plus some of my personal experiences, having personally gotten 60 shards.  My group consists of<br />
65 war - 80+ aa (defensive)<br />
65 clr - 50+aa<br />
65 dru - succor up and ready, quick evac AAs in case of MT death<br />
65 mag &amp; pet - 50+ aa<br />
65 enc &amp; pet - 50+ aa - mez not memmed, never needed<br />
65 nec &amp; pet - 50+ aa<br />
<br />
You now need to gather together 10 Lucid Shards. These identify as different letters, and are thus each unique. They identify and drop as follows: <br />
<br />
Dat - Fungus Grove from Shik`Nar Warriors and Royals, confirmed from: <br />
Shik`nar Warrior<br />
Shik`nar Royal Guard<br />
contrary to most people's impressions, I found this to be the fastest camp!  I managed 5 shards in 1-2 hours there.  I simply moved to the tunnel between the priest and the royal guards.  Only one roamer there.  The mobs shouldn't be underestimated as they're all DB and will multi-pull without pacify/fd splitter.  The royal guards do cast/heal.  You will be bogged down by chitin leggings/belts before you're done, as each guard drops 2 items per kill.  I thoroughly enjoyed this quick camp.  You can invis down to the royals area (I managed it twice, your mileage may vary)<br />
<br />
Dax - Akheva Ruins, confirmed from: <br />
A Shadow Reaver<br />
A Shade Golem <br />
A Rubble Rouser<br />
Shaded Stones<br />
I invis'd in and setup camp right outside the rock room.  I believe Va'Dynn spawns in that room.  In the corner, outside that room, there is one alien there.  It is free of roamers, outside of that one static spawn.  I pulled the entire room, rousers included.  This was a moderate length camp for me.  I got most of my shards from the rubble rousers (confirmed 100K hp, hit like pansies even before slow).  This camp was a semi-joke as I could double tank the 2 rubble rousers and another 2 rocks without issue.  The best I could muster with my non-wiz nuking group was 3 minutes on a rubble rouser :(  Very boring camp.<br />
<br />
<br />
Kel - The Grey, confirmed from: <br />
A Sun Revenant (near the lake)<br />
This was a moderate-long camp for me.  With 5 revenants there and a long respawn time, it was a suck.  The mobs are all single pullable and you can setup camp behind the lake (corner of zone) without fear of adds.  Watch going between the rocks as you'll spawn rock mob traps/etc.  I pulled either by going in the left side (as you face out from corner of zone) or the closest right corner, which has a large opening between the rocks.<br />
<br />
Kelera - Sanctus Seru or Katta, confirmed from: <br />
A Legionnaire of the Hand <br />
Named Legionnaires in the upper level of Sanctus Seru <br />
An Intervallum Guard <br />
Various Katta centurions (too many to list)<br />
I hit Sanctus Seru and went up to the tower or whatever it is.  When you zone in from twilight, I clicked on the crystal in front of the flag.  You're basically no top of a tower with mobs in little nooks along the outer wall and wanderers in the middle.  I made ~3 laps around the whole tower to get 6 shards.  The drop rate on this was moderate.<br />
<br />
<br />
Lor - Dawnshroud Peaks from Rockhoppers and Sambata in the cave, confirmed from: <br />
Sambata Tribal Worker <br />
A Rockhopper Ravager<br />
Simply run on in and plow your way through the entire cave system, as long as nobody is camping any of the spawns.  The drop rate here is fast-moderate.  The mobs are mainly green, with some LBs.<br />
<br />
Raf - The Deep from Thought Horrors across the bridge, confirmed from: <br />
A Thought Horror Spiriter<br />
A Thought Horror<br />
I finished this one very very quickly once I crossed the invisible bridge.  Yes, you can get the shards before the bridge, but after the bridge was the quickest for me.  I'm talking about 3 shards in under an hour there, twice!  I had to let 1 shard rot, because I got one before crossing the bridge.  No need to go in super deep, just the first couple of rooms.  If you get very close to the Ssra zone area, the mobs are serious, unslowable (some are anyways) with huge aggro range and decent DPS.<br />
<br />
Set - The Scarlet Desert from Sun Revenants and Reavers on the Plateau, confirmed from: <br />
A Sun Revenant<br />
A Sun Reaver<br />
This was a long camp for me.  It took me several multi-hour camps to get my 5 shards (already had 1 from a year ago when I used to level here).  I would pull the entire castle, the alien camp, start training from the lower tiers and still have to wait on respawns.  Almost everything is green, rare LB/DB mobs.<br />
<br />
Tak - Maiden's Eye from named Goranga, confirmed from: <br />
A Goranga Battlemaster<br />
A Goranga Forager<br />
A Goranga Prophet<br />
A Goranga Savant<br />
A Goranga Seer<br />
I camped the battlemaster + prophet/savant camps by sitting to the left of AR building.  The prophet/savant camp is hard to pull without many adds, so be ready for some decent sized pulls.  I'd just pull whatever and slow them one by one.  Having cleric celest spell on ya should give you enough time to build aggro before a real heal lands.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ved - Acrylia Cavern from Grimlings in Inner Acrylia, confirmed from: <br />
A Grimling Prison Guard<br />
A Grimling Deathguard<br />
A Sanctum Bloodguard<br />
I went to the inner sanctum, I guess, check out a map or read the posts on this zone.  You can invis all the way into the inner area, at one point you can switch to invis to undead, then back to invis to get to inner area.  The inner area was all DB to me.  The mobs can be semi-hard in mass quantities (I'm talking 4+ or 3+ with casters).  This was a fast-moderate camp for me.  I went into the area above the warlord, there are 'glass' windows overlooking the courtyard up there (also some kind of black pot up there, shows on track but cannot be attacked).  I sat in the corner of that room, 2 statics guard the door with 2 @ pot and another 2 opposite side of room.  <br />
<br />
Vin - Ssraeshza Temple from Skeletons in the Mines, confirmed from: <br />
A Soriz Corpse<br />
A Soriz Drudge<br />
Fighting here can be done AoE style or in my case, I'd just pull and war tank them.  If I got too many, I'd have everyone nuke and drop a mob per round of casting (enc/nec/dru/clr/mag).  This shard took me a moderate amount of time to get 6 of.  A lot of groups I bumped into had a lot of problems here, I really did not.  You can invis all the way down to the basement and safely camp in the corners of the first open area (closest to the tube that takes you down) without fear of roamers.  I would invis my mage down and CoH the group down so I didn't have to deal with invis breaking bs.  If you time things right, you can avoid the Taskmaster/Warden (see invis) and setup right outside the mines after the cart there.  Expect to deal with 3 &amp; 4 mob pulls.  You may think you got 2 inc and get 4, until you learn how they pull.  4 of them have decent DPS.  Expect a decent number of named spawns.  Taking it at a leisure pace, I would clear all the mobs right up to where the mines split and go left &amp; right.  You can easily do two groups, who don't mind sharing.  Keep casters way away from fighting areas and aggro management is quite easy.<br />
<br />
A lot of groups said they kept failing here cuz they didn't have crowd control.  You don't need CC down here.  You either need multi-tank or capable of nuking mobs down in a round.  I'm sure 1-2 wizzies could easily outnuker my 6sec casting group.<br />
<br />
Then, you need emp keys.. green metal of ssra bane weapons (not totally necessary according to reading, but definately helps), oh yeah, some pesky luclinite orbs from luclin named...  oh, maybe an emp kill too ;)<br />
<br />
Hope that helps someone!</div></div><hr />
