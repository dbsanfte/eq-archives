<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">After succesfully killing AD i hail PP and go down click on HoH, i visit PoT w/ out visiting HoH. So i decide to check the seer. i have killed him she says but need to prove worthy or whatever(blah blah blah). So i was wondering would it be possible for me to just get a friend to invis/run down there with me and click on it or do i need to find another AD raid i can join?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Keane Abrams</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You have not passed a PoJ trial yet if you clicked on the HoH portal and zoned into PoT after the tunnel under AD. <br />
<br />
You need to pass one of the PoJ trials before you get the AA and charm stats from AD. <br />
<br />
Is that what you meant or are you saying that you ported out after hailling the projection?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">A guildmate of mine just went through this in December.  It is no longer necessary to click into HOH behind AD.  You will get the same flag message the first time you zone into HOH after killing AD, whether you do so behind AD or directly from POT.  Once your POJ trial is done and you have unlocked memories, you will be able to zone into HOH directly from POT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Geltwip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yes, what both of the above posters said is true.  Do your PoJ trial, visit the seer, than zone in from PoT stones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">ok i did a PoJ trial like a week ago or two. i'll visit the seer today and see what she says.</div></div><hr />
