<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>BattleToad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetings members and lurkers of the steel warrior, I'd just recently been directed to this website for warriors from a friend, and decided to ask a few pressing questions on my mind.  I am currently a Froglok Warrior of the 41st level, and gear becomes a more and more pressing issue.  Seeing as this is my only, and first, character I have no alts of any significance( I have a couple 5-15 characters just for kicks.) I was forced to stop playing for a while after velious(sp?) was released, so I know a bit about the game.( Or I claim as much anyhow). Things of course are hitting for more and more damage and I cannot manage to hold up very well.  Seeing as I believe I'm doing everything right, I must assume it is a problem with what I'm wearing.<br />
      Everything I own, I either saved up some money to get, or got off loots.  Seeing what level I am, I can assure you that what &quot;I&quot; can get from loots is very poor.  I have not a magelo for this character yet, but I am working on it.  Anyhow, enough beating around the bush.  I'm requesting if anyone knows a good place that a warrior can farm for money.  I hear people say Hill Giants, but between being overcamped, killsteals, and deaths due to aggro.  I've concluded this isn't the best course of action.  I'm currently wearing mostly crusty and crafted armor.  With a Centi Shortsword and a Lamentation for weapons.(Remember crafted?  Yeah, the blue stuff! (^___^)<br />
<br />
      Any responces are thanked, I'll check back regularly to see!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">at 41 your options are slim to none :D HG's and IG's will still pulverize ya ( moreso being un-twinked as yourself )...prob your easiest and best bet is to go hit up runnyeye and kill some gobbos and collect the items ( black aloy/iron) and sell to merchant + collect pages and stuff too. coin ain't too shabby either.<br />
<br />
or just start looking for LDoN groups. good coin + experience + upgrades + points to buy armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Best stuff to farm at low levels is tradeskill stuff.  Lesser shades in shadeweaver's thicket drop shadeling silks much quicker than newbie zone spiderlings and are used in leather padding for smiths.  You could also go to mons letalis and kill greyhoppers for low quality rockhopper hides and make the padding yourself.  The silk and padding should sell pretty well in the bazaar depending on your server.  At 41 you may also be able to get a group in Dulak Harbor, and gem drops are pretty good there, with stuff like blue diamonds dropping of of exp mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Plumppoopsie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Tradeskills drops are good PP makers.<br />
<br />
Look to see how much spider silks, spiderling silks, hides, leather pading cost in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
Also, if you are in a guild, see if there are any smiths.  Find out there skill and check out www.eqtraders.com and see if they can make anything that is an upgrade for you.<br />
<br />
Think when I was in my 40's is when I got myself a set of Acrylia armour (I am a smith, so made myself).<br />
<br />
For me, being a smith, I made most of my upgrades as I leveled/increased smithing, then at 65, saved PP and bought the &quot;uber&quot; items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">spiders in EK (or anywhere for that matter)...last I checked, the silks were selling for 15 plat each on emarr.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Omnus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Get yourself sow of some kind and maybe a snare whip then head off to Hollowshade moor. Go kill the grimlings. They should be easy to kill, and very little competetion. Problem is you got shaman over there so they sow and run away, but if you kill em they drops acrylia runes, that are 1-4 plat a piece vendor sold and they are stackable. You should never run out of mobs, and should be quite easy. Just rough to deal with a runner when you lag for a sec, and he got a head start on you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The silkworm/greyhoppers and the EK spiders are the best low-risk bets I can think of. In East K you can also whack the lions, as they drop LQ, MQ &amp; HQ pelts, which smiths can use.<br />
In about 10 levels you might start running across some spell research items and even spells that can sell in the bazaar.<br />
LDoNs are not that great for cash, but over the long haul they're hard to beat for non-raid gear upgrades.<br />
I used to think when I was leveling up and desperately looking for ways to scrape together some pp that the fastest way for a warrior to get plat was to start a soloing caster, level the caster up, and farm stuff with his alt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">go to shadeweaver and hunt the shak drathas and loot chunk of condensed shadow. they are very low level so even solo you should be able to loot quite a lot of it. it sells on veeshan for 70-100pp each now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">As Omnus points out, Hollowshade grimlings are an option.<br />
If you get a couple levels and can find a partner also in need of cash, you can (carefully) make your way to the Grimling caves in Ten. Mountains. In addition to other nice loot, they drop windstones (check the prices on your server's bazaar and I doubt you'll vendor a windstone ever again). Also, the grimling runner, who drops the rallic pack pattern, spawns or runs by at least one of those caves.<br />
I didn't start farming there until level 50, when I could do it solo, which is why I suggest you get a partner. But you'll both make good plat doing this, and, at your level, some experience.<br />
<br />
Edit: I happened to do something last night while on a 52 War at the grimling caves that may be of interest here. With Regen 3, sitting, focused will (until it ran out) and max bind wound skill for that toon's level, I was healing myself for over 300 hitpoints a minute. Doesn't really help in a fight, but at that level it certainly cuts down on your downtime if you plan on farming. In your 40s, of course, regen AA is not an option yet, but now that you can sit and at the same tim BW up to 70%, you might find it worth it to max your BW skill if you plan on farming a good bit.</div></div><hr />
