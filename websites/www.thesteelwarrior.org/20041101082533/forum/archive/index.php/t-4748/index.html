<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Greyslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well I can't pull up Alla from Work.  Offhand though I know the Tak Bracers are better than Ornate.  Legs have tad more AC think same HP.  BP is better AC less HP.  If I had to choose between full set I would say Takish armor.  Mix and Match though different story :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Griglon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Just going with BP for now.  It will be a mix and match set.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If your gear is already quite good, and you do LDoN a lot, go for the Tak BP, you can augment it nicely.  We have a pally in the guild whose Tak BP owns my Kizrak's.<br />
<br />
However, you may be better off with the Kizark's BP, if you need upgrades in other areas.  For example, I have the Kizraks BP, and I used by LDoN points on weaponry (16 19 MDoD), and will upgrade my armor next.<br />
<br />
I also scored an &quot;inferior&quot; Kizrak's bracer to replace a Champion's.  Since I want Malevolent for legs, arms, and helm, and also an Anger 3 aug, it would be a long time before I could get the LDoN bracer, and I had useless plat saved up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Tak bp can be 140hp, kizraks can be 155 hp, how does that own it? (I'm not including pre-nerf ldon)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Double post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bulbog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well at least to me an ornate bp would be easier to come by especially considering it sounds like you're looking to buy other ldon armor pieces, may as well just get an ornate bp since it's pretty similar to the ldon bp and just use those points that you saved on the ldon armor that's obviously&gt; then ornate like the bracers or something, I haven't compared them much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Her BP owns mine 'cause hers is fully loaded.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Griglon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The way my points stand right now, I have a few more adventures to get the BP from NRo.  A friend of mine is giving me the Ornate BP mold which is why I was asking.  I could update other slots with LDoN ie. the bracers, helm, or greaves.  Most of my adventure points are in EF right now to get the Anger 3 augment.  The only reason I was asking is because the Ornate is basically mine already and wanted to know which one was the definite must have in the long run.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Dakryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If someones giving you the ornate BP use the points on a weak slot, Ornate is basically = to Tak,a lateral &quot;upgrade&quot; would be a waste of 1492 points</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Raunstonecutter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If you are getting the ornate BP, I'd just as soon use that and use your LDon points to upgrade other areas.  The Ornate BP certainly isn't a bad item.  But if you could use the Tak upgrades else where more desperatly, then go with the other areas first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Ornate generally have more STR / DEX / STA / AGI than the Tak armor, since the Tak armor have silly things like INT / WIS / mana.<br />
<br />
They are very equal though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Griglon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Thanks, that's the info I was looking for.  Appreciate it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>zito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Okay, but all &quot;if you can get this LDoN instead...&quot; or &quot;you should upgrade this first blah blah blah&quot; comments aside, which is preferable?  If the tooth fairy came up and said &quot;hey Zito, you hawt kilt-wearin sexah thang you, which of these 2 bad boys do you want??&quot;, which would be the preference?  The LDoN BP, with it's 6 more AC and 15 fewer HP, but 2 more augment slots; or the Ornate BP, with it's 6 fewer AC, 15 extra HP, and better stats?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Cuclain MacLlir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Tak is better, due to the type 3 augment slot imo. You can drop a 12hp or 15hp type1 into the Tak to equal the hp of ornate. Then you can put Vengeance IV or Regen III or Aura of Battle in the type 3 slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">You can drop a 12hp or 15hp type1 into the Tak to equal the hp of ornateNot anymore, any new xxx garnets of constitution that drop are now all type 7.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Sam DeathWalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">The ornate has a effect that gives you about 300 HP and some AC I cant see there is any choice here. You would be silly not to get the ornate BP.<br />
<br />
Basically get the ornate that has good effects and the Royal in the others slots.... <br />
<br />
Like Ornate legs also has a good effect (you can cast on others if yur sta is maxed)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Ahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Yes, the buff from the Ornate is good.  Be advised that Focus overwrites it.  That being said, I like being independent.<br />
<br />
If someone were *giving* me the Ornate, you can bet I'd swoop on it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Tharak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">If I was offered a Ornate BP I would take it, simply because there is no way someone can &quot;give&quot; you a tak BP; you have to earn it plain and simple.  If you can get an ornate BP in the process of saving the points for a tak BP, then you can upgrade other items, and if you get a tak BP before you can get an ornate drop you are still well off and the Tak BP is very very nice.</div></div><hr />
