<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Calhoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hail, just thought I'd ask for some help on some things that I could upgrade.  Here is my magelo link www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=296342 (my magelo) <br />
My guild is probably strong enough to do Arch Lich and maybe even Terris Thule, just to give you what I can reach.  Thanks 8^)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Smakz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">well, first off, if your AL capable, Ebony Armguards ( i think thats what they are called, 80hp arms from AL)<br />
<br />
Also from AL, Great Helm of True Vision (45ac 100hp helm)<br />
<br />
AL is on par with AoW, so look into killing big orange.<br />
<br />
Ditch the Pearly sarnak bauble, pick up a mosq leg, Bloodmetal, or Lizard bone/tooth earring.<br />
<br />
Va'Dyn is your friend, he has a Shaderock Amulet that he drops quite a bit, and would look really good around your neck, or hope for Faded Skull Medalion from AL.<br />
<br />
if your in Ssra, i assume you can do NToV with ease.  Eashen has a nice mask you may want to look at, Mask of the Sky.  As well as a ring, Ring of the Sky<br />
<br />
If your doing AL, you can kill everything in ssra save emp and High priest.  Convince your guild to kill cursed till you have a bloodfrenzy, and kill Creator till you have a Hategiver.<br />
<br />
Cursed also drops a nice BP, and a very nice cloak (BP of the Void 65ac 110hp, Cloak of Dark Shadows (see my magelo))<br />
<br />
Creator has a nice bracer that seems to elude me every time it drops (adamantium wristguard), and is a much easier kill than people think, hell, we had a chanter tank him once, just for shits and giggles.<br />
<br />
this should give you a few ideas.  hope it helps</div></div><hr />
