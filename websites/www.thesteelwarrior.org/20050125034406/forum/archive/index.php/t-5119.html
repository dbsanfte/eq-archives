<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maree</div><div class="date">01-08-2004, 02:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Question:<br />
When equipping certain armor/items/weapons with a combo of AC/HP/STA, how does that actually equate to which item would be the best?  I guess what I am trying to ask is how much AC/HP is added to your current stats?<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
Two different types of greaves.<br />
AC44 STA8 CHA/WIS/INT5 HP70 MANA65 SvC/M10<br />
<br />
AC48 STR10 WIS/INT6 AGI10 HP85 MANA80 SvF/D13<br />
<br />
At a glance, one would probably choose the higher AC legs, but wouldn't the STA of the first pair up the stats over the higher AC coupled with the HP70 on the first pair?  <br />
<br />
My unbuffed HP/AC I don't remember offhand, but lets just suppose the unbuffed HP is around 5200.  What would my stats jump to using either set of greaves? And could you please give me the formula/calculation so I don't have to keep asking the same question over and over? ;)<br />
<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Consider the following:<br />
<br />
1. You are unbuffed, and your Stamina is not maxxed. Yes, the 44ac 8sta legs do seem more attractive.<br />
<br />
2. You are unbuffed, and your Stamina is maxxed. No, the 44ac 8sta legs won't be better than the latter.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kilaara</div><div class="date">01-08-2004, 06:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is a point in game where you look at your equippment in another way than before.<br />
<br />
1. You are mostly exp grinding, youre Sta is not maxed, youre mostly out of PoP = AC is not so important than Sta and HP.<br />
2. You are raiding more and more and youre the MT or one of the MTs fighting more and more PoP Mobs .. AC is a point to look after. Youre Sta should be maxed ( buffed ). At that point sta is ok but not the nessessary part . So AC HP are better then.<br />
3. You are raiding Mobs with damnd AEs or damnd single Target DD/Dots ... and youre hit quite often with that crap cause youre resist are so lala .. the resiststats will become more interesting so you look for HP AC and Resists ( Sta maxed when buffed ) maybe at that point also atk ( some clickies maybe too ).<br />
4. Youre VT/Elemental .. mostly all you need is on the gear you can lay your hands on ( except of charisma ).<br />
5. The DI is often not going cause of the lack of charisma on your gear and your extrem &quot;high&quot; natural charisma and you start to kill everybody in an Ldon when he tries to roll on an charisma augment. :D</div></div><hr />

I consider the North Ro legs broken, suitable only for those whose STA is always maxed.  And, incidently, I consider the Everfrost BP and Bracers broken for similar reasons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maree</div><div class="date">01-08-2004, 09:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Great.<br />
Thank  you all.<br />
Now, how much AC/HP is added per STA point?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Batem Tuhates</div><div class="date">01-08-2004, 10:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't get AC for Sta I dont think <br />
HP's per Stamina depens on your Lvl think it was around 5.6 HP per Sta at lvl 63</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ealsur Helevorn</div><div class="date">01-08-2004, 10:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">AAs also affect the STA/HP equation, I think that with ND3 PE PD3, its more like 7hp/sta.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sikkorak</div><div class="date">01-08-2004, 10:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was debating these too.<br />
<br />
Don't bother, unless you have no way to get ornate plate legs.  THEN I would personally go with the EF legs with the sta, 10-15hp is easy., just get a 12 or 15hp dropped aug and aug it in slot 1 or slot 7.<br />
<br />
If you can, get ornate legs, ac/sta/85hp, just use one of the 40hp type 7 instead of the type 2 , that I KNOW you were going to aug the ldon legs with :)<br />
Also, ornate bp is better, hell everything but the bracer I would pass on, and get the bloodied boots from hard adventure for boots, can't really go wrong there.</div></div><hr />
