<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>meatshieldd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">on mine it regularly goes for 375,000-425,000plat</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kilzalot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">About that.. maybe 50-60k less.  Just depends on availability really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Drunder50</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">On CT Server, Anywhere from 325K to 600K. Just this morning I saw the only one for sale in the Bazaar for 250K. Could not believe my eyes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>NeoKlux</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">trying to sell one for 150k for 2 month</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>rexiant</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i'm currently in the market for one on drinal so i've been checking a lot. in the last month i've seen 363k, 370k, 400k, 550k, 550k, and 1M all from seperate people. it's rough finding someone selling it for what its worth and not just price-gouging. for me anything around the 350k mark feels right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>dethvegi1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Sold one i had for 250k a month ago.  250-300 typically, unless you run into bazaar price gougers we have here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jarelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">sold mine for 375k i think..usually between 350-500k<br />

Move to TZ IMO~ You could sell it for 300K and then the person that buys it would turn around and sell it for 400K. The rate is 400K if there is ever one forsale.</div></div><hr />

You missed one this weekend at 302k for a while. Sadly, I didn't have the cash either. Most of them sit in the bazaar on drinal at 550, but I don't think they sell. Ones below 400 tend not to stay there for long, so I'm guessing 350k is about what people are readily willing to pay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I paid 275k for mine over a year ago, and I was happy to get it that cheap. Going rate on TT at the time was around 400-500k. I still check the bazaar on TT and Prexus from time to time and BoC still seem to be going for 400k+ but they don't seem to sell very fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Cenyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">people sell 350-500k on Rodcet Nife, people buy at 250-300 though</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gaspie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">300ish to where nobody will be it 500k. I haven't seen many on Emarr in a while though. People are usually auctioning them without a price and I feel no need to ask since I can't afford one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Wulfran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">They're pretty rare to spot in bazaar on Veeshan. Usually start at 500K then come down. Don't see them less than 400K although I have heard a lot of the sales usually can be &quot;down&quot; to 350K...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Crathsor Gnawbones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Seen em holding steady at 375-500k on Vazaelle.  Have one person trying for ~camera pans close, with pinky held to corner of mouth~ One Miiillllliiioonnn Plat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Redleaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">On E'Ci, I rarely see them for sale.  When I do its the same &quot;Power&quot; traders that I see with other high priced items.  Anyhow, they usually cost around 400-500k.  On a related note and hopefully not to much of a thread derailer, What price do you see Helmet of Rallos Zek go for?  On my server its now up to 300k.  I saw one for 180k one time but didnt have the cash.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Hates</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">On Stromm they sell for 275-350k.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Quarg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I think anywhere from 250-400k on druzzil... although helms of rallos zek are cheap, like 150k usually if I remember right.</div></div><hr />

ugh. i so would have snatched that up. trying to not spend every penny i have in upgrading my hate. so much gear upgrading i need to do, and it's a lot harder to make money when you have no money  :mad: <br />

BoC, 12 wins from dual A3's, then sloooowly start working my way down the list from most to least expensive bazaar upgrades. 3 cheers for working nightshift and farming/bazaaring at 6am  :(</div></div><hr />
