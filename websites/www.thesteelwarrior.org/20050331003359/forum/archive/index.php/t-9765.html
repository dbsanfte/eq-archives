<br />
All of these mobs have Place Holders. They will pop like one in 3-5 times. Easy do with my Six Box Crew. Have dropped runes up to level 70 (very rare). The PH have dropped the &quot;any mob in the zone&quot; rares. You can get to all with invisible. Only the Stonetooth Camp might have a see invisible dog on the bridge from Ornaia. If so you can take the bridge to the left as you leave castle from zone in. Watch out for wandering mob Souldrainer at the BowHound camp as it will kind of pop right on you. Need like 12-18 to take it down but drops a nice range item, but not better for wizards then the BowHound range.<br />
<br />
I believe its safe to assume that all named will drops runes (although the Noc Slavehunter is reported not to so far), as well as the No drop items for the Armor Quests, in addition to their loot. So you can’t really go wrong camping any of them.<br />
<br />
1. Kyv Bowhound<br />
Easy camp. PH is a dog in gully. Of interest to Wizards is the Range Item on SamAdvancer.<br />
<br />
3. Noc Slavehunter<br />
PH is the Noc next to the two guards across from Daignal. Has only dropped the Mnk/Bst Hands, no runes yet.<br />
<br />
4. Bowlord Rorn<br />
This is my favorite camp. Best to pass the room and go into the hallway towards 8 on the map. Rorn PH is the 2nd bowguy (under the flag thing) on your left looking back into the room. The dog near you sometimes is see invisible. Have to split the dog and the bowguy under the flag near you off from Rorn PH but once you do the spilt it loots city. In 7 hours on day I got 4 runes, 2 caster facemasks (see the mask on Samadvancer) and 2 cloaks I sold for 100K twice. Also got some gauntlets for a quest (don’t have warm Loyalist faction yet though).<br />
<br />
5. Dragorn Laborer<br />
Dragorn Model that has a Dragorn laborer etc as a model. Its next to the tree to the right of Tornwing Statue as you look at Tornwing from the front, away from Ornaia. Its a Red Dragorn model. If you pull to the back all the mobs for the Tornwing event will not assist. Drops a hybrid ring and more rare the Earring of Fanciful Hope (see Samadvancer Ear). And the melee Conqueror's Cape.<br />
<br />
6. Ornaia the Foul <br />
Mob is a caster. Casts a pet which disappears after a bit. Best to Mez and forget. Do not pull far from Spot as it warps back and gets 33percent more health. Watch Guards as they will add. SnakeLady Model. Seems to have spell shield might want to dispel. Drops the Map of Old Kuua a lot. Might drop nice ranger ear. Drops warrior cape.<br />
<br />
7. Stoneworker Stonetooth<br />
Kind of a far camp. Hill fight. Drops a fine caster ring. Shimmering Band, on Samadvancer.<br />
<br />
8. Tyian Rianda <br />
PH is the Dragorn model 3rd from the left looking in from the hallway going to Bowlord Rorn. The first Dragorn model to the left is another Dragorn Prodigy PH. You need to split the back two dragorns. Drops the nice belt that SamDancer is wearing.<br />
<br />
9. A Dragorn Prodigy <br />
PH is a Dragorn Model, next to Stonetooth close to the bridge. This mob drops the Weather-Worn Signet every time for the Anguish quest so you don’t die when you enter Anguish.<br />
<br />
10. GraniteSmash<br />
Warps if you pull while on a the Hill. Stone model is place holder. Priest Ear and a 10AC augment.<br />
<br />
11. Ikaav Slaveherder<br />
You can single pull over the wall to the GraniteSmash camp. PH is near tree in corner near Warrior Epic mob.<br />
<br />
The see invisible dog on the bridge near Ornaia (random spawn time) drops the cleric face on SamEnhancer.<br />
<br />
Around 12 there are lots of mobs and what looks to be a very perilous camp with some named archers. Also there is a see invisible noc there so I have not been able to check it out. The “fluxing ore” is a ground spawn around there for Wizard Epic.<br />
<br />
There are also the rare &quot;any mob in the zone&quot; drops. They all dropped from Place Holders, need to kill like 100 or more though to see one drop. Try and work up Loyalist faction for the Armor turn in quest. Avoid killing mobs that lower Loyalist faction if you can.<br />
<br />
All of these are one group camps. Getting the Invisibility that you can cast on other that does not drop is a great help for moving around. Its Cloud of Indifference for Chanters. Wizards also get one.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarcazzm</div><div class="date">11-17-2004, 12:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks for the update, sam, great post :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telen</div><div class="date">11-17-2004, 12:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for all the info!  Just started spending some time in this zone this week, moved from HS and NC mostly.  Mobs are mean!  Got lucky on the first PH for Ornaia, got the Serpent Ring (forget exact name, 135 hp, etc, uber).  Was the second or third mob I pulled.<br />
<br />
Need to get Ungli the Swift on your map.  Went to camp him one day with a description of where he was, but wasn't sure where the PH was when I got jumped by some see-invis Ukun that hit for 2500 and took me out quick.  At that point we reverted back to NC for a bit before finally returning to RCoD, and I went ahead and bought the BBC.  Mobs are mean in RCoD tho!  I died three times that night, twice to some noc blood something or other, mean ass fast hitting mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ichkabibel2</div><div class="date">11-17-2004, 01:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ungi the Swift spawns between #7 and #12 on the map about half-way up the hill.  his PH is an ukun sitting by himself.  he drops a melee shield, Bygone Butcher's Cleaver, runes, and dranik blood standard (wrist)..<br />
<br />
 Further up the hill, theres one static noc and another noc that sometimes roams down.. that roamer is PH for Vornad Deathtusk, drops caster boots and dranik blood standard, and a spell guard III aug;  no runes in over 10 kills<br />
<br />
there are several other normal named up at the #12 spot, but the Kyv Sharpshooters are perma rooted, see invis, and blast u with explosive 1500 dmg arrows so unless they were recently raided that area is pretty much off limits<br />
<br />
<br />
also of notice for warriors.. Granitesmash can drop 10ac aug;  forsaken stone of ire or something like that, type 7 goes in pretty much all slots.  Noc Slavehunter also drops 15atk aug</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telen</div><div class="date">11-17-2004, 01:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah, ok, that's where we were looking for Ungi PH.  There were lots of mobs in that area and it looked difficult to pull.  While I was searching I ran into a wandering Ukun that hit for 2500ish.  I forget the name, but he wanders along the bridge and down onto the hill and sees invis.  Is he normally up around there?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">11-17-2004, 02:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I bumped into that named Ukun too, he was walking on the bridge next to Tiorpat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">11-17-2004, 02:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The roaming Ukun seems about the same difficulty as Discordling Warfiend in WoS.  One groupable but not for the average group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telen</div><div class="date">11-17-2004, 02:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, but is that Ukun always there?  I was going to pull to the hall that goes towards the Murkgliders, because I couldn't see another good pull spot, but that Ukun roams right by there making that area near impossible to pull.  Is there a better pull spot or place to setup camp with no roamers or spawns?  He may be one groupable, but way beyond my ability to tank at this point.   :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vigdis SangCaru</div><div class="date">11-17-2004, 02:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If the Ukun FleshHunter spawns, he will roam in that area.<br />
<br />
In my opinion, the very safest place to pull Ungi is on TOP of the Murk cave.  If you go inviz, head out of the cave, take a right, and right before the Ungi PHer take another right and head up the hill.  This is a &quot;safe spot&quot; with zero roamers and zero spawners.  It can be annoying to pull up if someone in the group requires line of sight since obviously you won't see the mob until it's actually in camp, but it's just a lot easier and safer than the Murk cave entrance (which has around 3 Murk roamers and 1 Murk spawn - good if you want to kill Murks or get drops from them, bad if you just want Ungi or the other named out in the field).    <br />
<br />
The cave top will NOT aggro Fleshhunter, but when he roams that area you will be limited in what you can pull until he roams back across the bridge, etc.</div></div><hr />
