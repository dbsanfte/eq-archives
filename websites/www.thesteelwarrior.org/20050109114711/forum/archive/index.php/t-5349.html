 Maybe there's a kernel of truth in some of their whines, but I know those three classes aren't hurting for group invites like we were, and if they are can at least go solo for XP if they are. And all three of them justify it with our upgrades and stand down.<br />

<br />
Shamans really don't have anything to bitch about.  The days of them being a healing class are gone.  They're a utility class that can heal, but unfortunately there are going to be people we can't evolve with the class and will never be happy.  It's the same shit at the druids grove.  We should nuke better, we should heal better, we should DoT better, we should buff better.  Fuck off.  Your class is your class, and ya know what, I'd say that classes are actually about as balanced as they've ever been.  Which of course coincides with a new class being released.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The melee changes have made my warrior more fun, and the shaman class really has been pretty stagnant since Kunark, so perhaps change or two would breathe new life in to that as well.  Personally, I'll live if they don't change a thing, but the same was true of the melee changes.  I love them, but I would still be playing my warrior if they didn't happen.</div></div><hr />

If I easily out DPS your Ranger you got equipment problems, how about stop leveling and farm or somehow get better stuff. As for Shaman and Necro, you guys are to funny! Really now, I LOVE grouping with both classes! In fact I two box a Shaman, and you know what? They change anything on my Shaman I will be pissed! They are that good! I pick a Necro (if possible) for every LDoN I can! Met some that crowd control better than most Enchanters! Add Pet, twitch, heals, they are the best in a group! I plan on leveling mine, then doing a 6 necro LDoN, should be sick DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flair</div><div class="date">01-23-2004, 12:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Many Rangers very much enjoy tanking for experience groups. It is challenging and rewarding. The more the other melee classes pull ahead of us in this category, the less we will be able to perform that function. Rangers don’t really see themselves tanking the big mobs and raid targets. However, they do like to tank for regular groups in zones appropriate for their level and gear. <br />
<br />
One of those fixes would be to add Triple Attack to our repertoire of melee advantages. This would help bring us past Warriors (thus increasing our desirability) and would help put us solidly in the lead among the hybrids for overall damage. <br />
<br />
I have no comment other than to state I want whatever he is smoking.  I have a friend who is a ranger who offtanks quite often in LDoN/exp groups.<br />
<br />
And all three of them justify it with our upgrades and stand down. <br />
<br />
I read through all 3 initial posts/proposals...I only saw warrs referenced once by Rangers and no reference to our stand down.</div></div><hr />

 At any rate, NONE of this hit the boards until after pure melee finally got upgrades. Kinda like how the PoN boards exploded with 'issues' after they finally saw the discipline bar.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not quite true. Every class board has been filled with wishlists, and &quot;I wants&quot; since before the melee balance chat even.<br />
<br />
But the melee balance thing does give any class a soapbox that's for sure. Now they can just point to warriors or melees in general and say &quot;I want a free cookie too!&quot;<br />
<br />
What's funniest about HYBRIDS asking for free cookies, is that they got some very REAL benefits out of CASTER rebalancing that went on for the past few years. And now they want in on melee balancing. Which of course would leave them with the best of both worlds. It's kind of sad and funny at the same time.<br />
<br />
And HEY, berserkers are coming to unbalance the whole damn scale, one more time!</div></div><hr />

Shaman are probably strongest in a group setting...  <br />
<br />
Okay soloers (yes, we can kill big stuff, but it also takes forever, so what's the point?)... <br />
<br />
But having more than one or two shaman on a raid is nearly pointless.  I think a lot of what was suggested, like a group heal over time, or better quick heal, or better nuke is to give us something meaningful to do in a raid setting when we're the 3rd or 4th shaman.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Rangers need their archery in wall thing fixed really bad, especially since they are introducing a new range damage class, they need to fix that crap.  I think rangers should do more damage with melee too, but you have to give up something for that range ability, so if they fix archery I think rangers are good.<br />
<br />
Necros whining just seems normal to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">01-23-2004, 05:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As I read it, the necro thread is about necros not stacking well on raids past a certain point, due to the set number of debuff slots on each mob.  Bummer, some classes do not stack well for raiding.  That is just how it is.<br />
<br />
Rangers want more melee, more tankability, more heals, more utility.  I have no issue with them getting a little more melee damage, and maybe a little more utility, but they do not need to be able to tank better, they do not need more healing.  I do agree with the comment in the ranger post about improving dual wield for all classes that can tho.<br />
<br />
Shaman have the most legitimate gripe, and the best thought out message(they point out that they don't want it all, as that would be overpowering, but that they are offering suggestions that one or two of would help them enough).  Shaman have lost ground in a big way.  Several classes can slow well enough(shaman signature ability), and offer more damage, more utility to a group(BL's can buff more hp's than shaman, plus have SD and paragon, enchanters have KEi +, DC pets, CoD pets,  along with mez, bards...well bards can do it all).  Shaman are still desired in groups, but I think that shaman are looking towards the day where this may no longer be true, and are working to head that off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">01-23-2004, 05:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Had a shaman slower in a BoT group the other day, he had to leave, the BST took over slowing and buffing duties, and we replaced the shaman with a DPS class.  I'm not uber by any means (7k buffed, 8 AA), and we did just as well with that setup as we did with the shaman buffing/slowing and the BST on DPS alone.  The cleric didnt seem to be having any more difficulty keeping me on my feet even with a less effective slow spell on the mobs.  Of course, hybrids being more powerful than one or both of their parent classes probably doesnt surprise anyone who regularly frequents this board.</div></div><hr />

I don't see a problem with upping their DPS or seeing them get more spells (not heals).<br />
<br />
But Rangers can already tank in xp groups/LDON.<br />
<br />
It's the folks who come to POV and BOT with no AA's and 2000 hp unbuffed and get smacked down that whine too much.  And that includes knights, warriors AND rangers.</div></div><hr />

I do. Berserkers already have enough time finding groups because everyone is fighting for the DPS slot.<br />

And with no real raid role, what are all the berserkers going to do?<br />

Can't speak for the rest of them, but the shaman one does come from the shaman boards...  Once it was complete, it was posted to TNZ because there's no evidence that anyone from Sony looks at the shaman boards more than once every year or so.  It has almost 300 /agree posts in support of it on the shaman boards.<br />

<br />
Oh please...<br />
Shamans have had all their abilities farmed out to every other class out there plus a new one read bst.<br />
I know this might be really hard for you guys, but try to think for just a second...<br />
<br />
At 65 in elemental gear, actually at any level, what buffs do you ask for from a shaman? Focus, and possibly FA.<br />
All your other effects should be maxed. <br />
Shamans [b]used to be the king of buffs. But we all know that the only stat worth a shit was sta. everything else is pointless so that was a lie... <br />
[damage/dots]<br />
Shamans, pre 50, where the KING of dots. They are the only class that can stack all their dots from their two spells lines. Ebolt used to be the shit... Well this died some where and now necros are the undisputed kings of dots and damage over time...<br />
[Damage/Direct]<br />
All classes including clerics have always had better/faster nukes than shaman... Nothing new here.<br />
[Pet]<br />
Shamans get a pet line at a late level(34). But acording to Sony Shamans aren't a pet class... The Shaman pets were nerf horribly to the point that they are about a sgood as shadowknight pets... Actually some would argue that SK pets tend to be better, although lower lvl you don't have to feed them items so they dual weild...<br />
[Healing]<br />
Shamans are the worste in healing, Paladins in GoD will be 100hps below shaman. A TRUE hybrid healing as good as a preist. sorry you had your hybrid tanking as good as a warrior battle, now shamans have to fight the same pricks over their core abilities.<br />
[Mana regen]<br />
Shamans have the best mana regen in the game. Cept for Enchanters(gather Mana AA) And soon to be put out by clerics in GoD(hello free 2500mana).<br />
But lets put the AA's aside for a moment. Shamans to gain this Mana regen to offest the the higher spell costs for all thier spells which is a direct result of the mana regen(catch 22?) must spend constant time Canni'ing/Torpor/Quisense them selves.<br />
During this Canni tiem they are unable to cast any thing else... <br />
<br />
blah blah blah... Any way how would you feel if all your abilities were farmed off to someone else? Oh wait that already happened and look what you did...<br />
<br />
Pull your heads out for a secound... jeess. There just might be more broken in this game than your little corner of the world...</div></div><hr />

That's not going to be a pretty fight. Good luck. <br />
<br />
Over on Monkly Biz, someone just started a thread asking for Avatar and Ferine Avatar to be made more comprable to KEI and VoQ. It's an interesting idea. And one I'm sure quite a few people here wold certainly support. <br />
<br />
The suggestion even included getting rid of the reagent cost altogether.<br />

<br />
Um, That was the same with pet canni, In fact it brought mages mana regen up 25 points a tick with rathe's son. It also had the same draw back as shaman canni. All I can say is, Pot meet Kettle.<br />
<br />
Also is Canni is making you unable to cast spells etc then why the hell are you canning while a mob is in camp, Thats the dumbest thing I have heard, Even giving shamans 10 seconds between pulls to canni and heal themselves they are fine. <br />
<br />
Mages did the same kinda canni with their pets.. 12 seconds to summon, 2 seconds to regain mana, And the develpers said that was fine, The only problem, Where shamans get new canni, Pet Canni over time with new pets for mages would become a bit too powerful. <br />
 <br />
Well I say Necro / Shaman regen capabilities are a bit too powerful and should be introduced to the nerf bat.  ^_^<br />

But this is just a rants board so take it as you would.<br />

<br />
Rathe's Son pet was not the pet to use for pet canni, it was the level 49 pet that was most efficient(BTW, if any class has room to complain right now it is mages, who can solo poorly outside of charm, yet have none of the spells needed to make charm safe, and can only charm elemental mobs, which are rare, and are a DPS class in groups, with poor DPS and almost no utility for a group).<br />

I don't know about necro's, but go look at shaman spell mana costs.  Shaman spells are horribly inneficient mana wise, to balance their mana regen.  If you nerf their mana regen, are you going to go back and retune mana costs on shaman spells?<br />
<br />
Can 5 needs constant attention? <br />
<br />
A shaman who only casts canni 5 is a lazy shaman, and should be booted from a group immedietly.<br />
<br />
Stop bitching if your in time and a shaman. You have won EQ. You can can duo camp water, You can, etc etc etc.  <br />
<br />
If a shaman is in Time, they are a raid shaman, and part of one of the lest stackable classes in raiding.  More than 2 shaman at a raid is almost a waste.  Also note that shaman have not complained about there soloability, tho several classes are much better at it(wizzy, necro, druid and chanter pop to mind), but strictly about there group role.  To be honest, why would you pick a shaman as slower when you could have a) a bard, who improves everything that everyone in the group does, and pulls, b) an enchanter, who also adds mana regen forthe group, plus best haste, plus more DPS, plus Mezz, c)a BL, who adds more hp's buffs, more DPS, mana regen buffs, plus paragon?  <br />
<br />
Shaman are not asking for the world, just to be able to do a bit more DPS in group situations, and/or heal a little better.  They see a day coming when what they have to offer a group is simply not enough.  When perception catches up with reality, shaman could be hurting like we were so recently.</div></div><hr />

Yes, because there clearly is not enough mana in the game already to the point where thats all a shaman ever has to use 90% of the time before you run the rest of the group oom.</div></div><hr />

 Hi, did, thanks.<br />
<br />
 And I pride myself that those in the Warrior class held the public outcries until the final straw was reached with the whole Quarm thing. Otherwise, the Warrior community has been a model of restraint. Especially when compared to a community whose class is one of the best soloers, one of the most sought after for groups, and absolutely essential in raids.<br />
<br />
 As far as this whole 'No more than 2 ever needed' whine.......<br />
<br />
 The only things that stack in a raid are damage, whether Melee or Caster. So why have more than one of any class that isn't there to do damage?<br />
<br />
 Because a lot of encounters require it for one, but for another REDUNDANCY IS JUST AS IMPORTANT AS EFFICIENCY.<br />
<br />
 It amazes me that people who live in high end guilds, who see tank rotations, CH rotations, and the like never understand the idea that BACKUP IS ESSENTIAL.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Shaman soloing is at best slightly more efficient than grouping.  The only real soloing a shaman can do at high level is root rotting, and is very slow.  Essential for raids, but after buffs are done, 2 debuffs, and poor backup healing and even worse DPS is all they have.<br />
<br />
Sought after by groups tho?  Where?  I would take in a heartbeat a bard, a chanter, or a BL over a shaman in any group situation.  We had it bad when we were third choice as tanks, now imagine being 4th choice for slower spot.  While a shaman can both heal and slow, what tends to happen is they bounce a couple slows, and start having to chain cast Tnargs(1300 hp fst heal for 450 mana a shot) just to keep the tank up.  That happens often enough that most shaman hate being the only healer in a group.  Shaman best DPS is DoT's, but to be efficient they have to run to completion(which does not happen much in exp groups).  Best nuke is Velium strike(925 damage for 300 mana and a 7.8 cast time).  Every other slow class offers more to a group.  More hp's buffed, or mezz, or more DPS, or more mana regen.  <br />
<br />
As soon as perception catches up with reality, shaman will be in a bad situation, and GoD offers nothing much for them.  A new slow will be nice, but it is less slow than a BL's 65 slow.  A new disease DoT that shaman simply don't need or want.  AA's that are even worse than most classes get.</div></div><hr />

 Best slower in the game. Period. Hands down. Why would groups want that?<br />
<br />
 Second best (Some might argue best) TANKING slower in the game. Only BL's can deal with the punishment the way a Shaman can - it means your slower isn't gonna fold like a carboard table the first time it gets hit.

 <br />

<br />
 Best stat buffer in the game hands down? Shaman. And it may not seem like much at the moment, but as Endurance tricks get added to the game for all classes, it's going to mean more and more. Now, if you're talking like you are in the end of your little whinefest, then no, you're going to have a hard time being primary healer AND slower for a group. Of course, if you look at the other HEALING classes, well, their slow sucks. :D <br />
<br />
 Shamans get groups, no two ways about it. Shamans are well represented at all levels of EQ, which is a FAR cry from the place Warriors were at when they finally got taken care of.</div></div><hr />

Because the need for best slow is not great.  The difference between shaman slow and BL/Ench/bard slow is not that great, while the other things they offer a group are great.<br />
<br />

Bard slow has almost no agro, therefore negating any need to take a hit.  Enchanters can easily rune tank, and BL's can take a few hits themselves. <br />
<br />

<br />
And as more and more melee people are maxing there stats(thanks LDoN augs), there is less and less need for them.  BTW, BL's can stat buff almost as well, and offer a better attack buff.<br />
<br />
Now, if you're talking like you are in the end of your little whinefest <br />
<br />
Actually, I pointed out why I felt that shaman had some justification in asking for help.  You where the one who started this thread with 'I almost wish they'd never fixed us...... <br />
......because now the fucking RANGERS, NECROS and SHAMANS are whining.'  Now  that  is a whine.  Poor you, it is so terrible that other classes might have issues too.<br />
<br />
Shamans get groups, no two ways about it. <br />
<br />
They do.  And even when things where the worst for us, warriors got groups as well(and I might add, we had shaman on there message board talking about how badly we needed help, not dismissing us as whiners).  Shaman are looking at the basic fact that as soon as people wake up, they will find that there groups are better with another class, and that simply is true.<br />
<br />
Shamans are well represented at all levels of EQ, which is a FAR cry from the place Warriors were at when they finally got taken care of. <br />
<br />
So shaman should wait till they where as bad off as we were before they say anything?  Or should they step up now, and work to keep  there class wanted, before the inevitable happens?<br />
<br />
Whining because other classes have issues, and many of them legit issues, is not going to make you many friends, and serves only to make you look foolish, in addition to being a first class whiner.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A shaman using only Canni5 every time it pops is getting LESS mana regen than a druid using 9 and mask, or a cleric using zealot and yaulp.  Add to that the fact that you have to heal that damage, and you can't use it in certain situations, makes it even less comparably.<br />
<br />
Um, That was the same with pet canni, In fact it brought mages mana regen up 25 points a tick with rathe's son. It also had the same draw back as shaman canni. All I can say is, Pot meet Kettle. <br />
<br />
The second part was explaining why it didn't need nerfed, not comparing it more to mage pet canni.<br />
<br />
why the hell are you canning while a mob is in camp, Thats the dumbest thing I have heard <br />
<br />
Hahahaha.  Right.  First, if shamans can't use canni while a mob is in camp, once again their mana regen drops and classes with passive mana regen pull ahead again.  Second, you are an idiot.  If a shaman is not using canni constantly then they are slacking, and are still suffering from very inefficent spells during that time.<br />
<br />
Yes, because there clearly is not enough mana in the game already to the point where thats all a shaman ever has to use 90% of the time before you run the rest of the group oom <br />
<br />
Shaman spells are some of the most ineffient spells there are.  They were given them because of the mana regen, and now they need the mana regen to keep up with their mana.<br />
<br />
Hi, did, thanks <br />
<br />
Then what the hell was the point of your other post?  You quote him asking how you would feel if it happened to us, and then list a bunch of ways how it did happen.  Yet he even admitted it happened to us in the next sentence.  Everyone already knew that it happened, your post was just redundant.<br />
<br />
Best slower in the game. Period. Hands down <br />
<br />
Just because they have the best percentage, doesn't mean they are the best slower.  We always tanked better than a pally, even if by a tiny bit, yet were we the best tank?  The difference between the slows is pretty similar to the difference between the tanks, as in, not worth caring about in an exp group.  Easily done LDoN high risk with just a bard slower.<br />
<br />
Will go more into this at the bottom.<br />
<br />
Best stat buffer in the game hands down? Shaman. <br />
<br />
Hah.  You're right, they can buff stats best, though if you buff most stats, you are wasting mana and buff slots.  I have 124 unbuffed agi, and even when I get up to 305 agi (SoV and FA), there is not a noticable amount of more endurance.  Also, I don't even need a pure agi buff to cap agi and I have ONLY 124, so why the hell do stat buffs matter?<br />
<br />
Ok, so lets see how shamans compare:<br />
Bst buffs give more hps than shaman buffs, plus are much more dps, have Fero (which is better than FA), and mana regen for group.<br />
Other priests outheal shamans easily<br />
Pallys and shamans are close in heal abilities (GoD pally heal is &gt; best shaman heal which is not a GoD spell, cause shamans don't get a GoD heal).<br />
Chanters also give crowd control, better haste, mana regen for everyone, much more dps.<br />
Rangers are close to shaman nukes.<br />
Bards have good enough slow for groups, mana regen, crowd control, pulling, etc.<br />
<br />
I certainly don't think they need a ton of work, but they are not the uber class they once were, and could really use an upgrade (or a bst nerf, which I am more in favor of).</div></div><hr />

I suffered through Planes of Power, when it came to getting group related XP. The flagging issues at one point restricted me to FOUR lackluster zones. And I was forced further into grouping with a lot of strangers. It sucked ass.<br />
<br />
Many MANY a shaman was highly sought after in those heady days, due to slow being so integral in the non-uber, non-flagged, bottom of the barrel XP group makeup.<br />

Seeing other classes feel the pain of having their roles and abilities FARMED out to everyone else ... I am petty enough to admit I get a secret little chuckle out of it.

 And the need for CH isn't that great either in XP groups, especially when you have druids with the Healing AA's and Foci running around (And shamans too, let's not forget - or is that the point?)<br />
<br />
 Add to that you're not talking about the other things that you add to a group that those classes individually don't. I'd love to see any of those three slowing classes throw a significant heal.<br />

 Bard slow also has to be continuously reapplied, and it gets resisted too, trust me on this, I own one, I know. Not to mention that it's still not a 75% slow. Then again, neither is anyone else's, and in a normal XP session for 90%+ of the playerbase, that extra 5-20% means something - at least enough that shamans are the preferred slower in groups, especially if you have CC.<br />

 I wanted to point out that almost ALL of our toys got 'spread out' a LONG time ago to other classes, and it didn't break us as a functional class - a lot of people forget that, or minimize just HOW much our abilities got whored out. I felt it incumbent to post it because this is a guy clueless enough to post that Shamans are 'broken'.<br />

<br />
 Right now? Not much. Don't think the way it is today is the way it's going to be, tho. There's already talk about making spells with Endurance regen - guess who are going to get them? Sure as hell not Enchanters or Bards, and what BL's get will be a pale echo of what Shaman get. Not to mention the fact (But I will again, because people seem to keep forgetting it) that MOST FOLKS IN GAME DON'T HIT 305 ACROSS THE BOARDS IN XP GROUPS. Now, maybe folks geared to the eyeteeth in VT+ gear do, I dunno. But what I DO know is the vast majority of folks on each individual server aren't in VT+ guilds, and aren't 100% geared to VT+ levels. They like Shaman buffs, they use Shaman buffs, they like Shamans in their groups, they actively look for Shamans for their groups, and that's a hell of a long way from 'broken' or needing Warrior style attention to their class.<br />
<br />
 For my money, a healing upgrade about halfway between Druids and where they are now would suffice to reestablish them as a 'priest class', and solidify even more their desireablity as a group and a raid class, and amplify their solo ability.

I always look for a BST/Shaman first for the slowing spot, if I have a choice Shaman first. I just love their buffs, ability to heal if it is needed, and I find their aggro/survivability ratio to best suit a warrior out of any other slowing class.  <br />
<br />
Beastlords give me more aggro problems because they mellee after they have slowed, but I agree they are also an awesome class to have, especially for CCin a mob or two if there is none. Bards I will choose last for a slowing role because of reasons mentioned above. I still like a Bard in my group for other things though. Enchanters... Well getting an Enchanter is like winning the lottery. If you can find one that can tash, slow, mez, understands that runes are your friend, and can handle a charmed quad hitting pet all with about 50hp buffed you have hit the jackpot. I would say 10% of all Enchanters I have met though are that good.<br />
<br />
Here on Fennin Ro though its pretty much the only thing thats in very high demand, so you often don't have much choice what slower you want in your group. They are like gold on this server. Thank God I am good friends with a few :).<br />
<br />
<br />
edit:- And yeah having read those posts you are correct I do feel Shaman have the biggest gripe out of those classes and the poster did express his issues far better. The ranger one I found ridiculous, the necro one I feel the problems with necros are that people still do not understand how good a necro can be in a group or raids. One of the most  most underrated classes IMO.</div></div><hr />

If you've read it, you'll notice that a healing upgrade is one of the suggestions in there and it clearly says we don't want everything listed...  Just something.  I'm sure that if we got what you just described, many, many shamans would be happy.  I know healing is a very big concern for many of us.  Slow mitigation has reduced the effectiveness of our slow by up to 75%, with no corresponding increase in healing power to compensate.<br />
<br />
To repeat: That list of suggestions DOES NOT say we want ALL of that stuff.  It's just a list of things for sony to consider, and maybe pick one or two if they think they're reasonable!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would take a druid healer any day over a cleric healer.  You are right, CH is not that important any more, and a druid offers more.  Note tho that the shaman's biggest heal is 2k(with a 10 second cast time), and most 65 shaman do not mem it, prefering Tnarg's(1300 hp's for 450 mana) due to a casting time of 3.75.  That is a huge difference in healing.<br />
<br />
Add to that you're not talking about the other things that you add to a group that those classes individually don't. I'd love to see any of those three slowing classes throw a significant heal. <br />
<br />
And I would love to see a shaamn pet do significant DPS, and a shaman offer a group mana regen, etc.  Those things that other classes do are much greater than being able to heal 1300 hp's, or a 300 per tick heal over time(that does not stck with cleric heal over times).  A cleric or druid can keep me healed just fine, extra heals are not needed.  DPS tho is always welcome, as is mana regen, CC, more hp's, etc.<br />
<br />
Bard slow also has to be continuously reapplied, and it gets resisted too, trust me on this, I own one, I know. <br />
<br />
So you can only twist in 3 other songs while slowing...oh no.  Yes, it will get resisted, but it is not that big of deal.<br />
<br />
it's still not a 75% slow. Then again, neither is anyone else's, and in a normal XP session for 90%+ of the playerbase, that extra 5-20% means something - at least enough that shamans are the preferred slower in groups, especially if you have CC. <br />
<br />
That 5 to 20 % is nearly meaningless.  Add in mobs that mitigate slow(and there are plenty, go visit HoH for example), and that 5 to 20 % is even less.<br />
<br />
(But I will again, because people seem to keep forgetting it) that MOST FOLKS IN GAME DON'T HIT 305 ACROSS THE BOARDS IN XP GROUPS <br />
<br />
Guess what...with a BL to buff you, you will get almost as many stats as with a shaman, plus more hp's(the most important stat), plus more attack.  Plus the group gets more DPS.  If you are so clueless as to feel that that the few extra agi that a shaamn gives you is more important than more hp's, and more attack, and more group DPS, I pitty the people who have to group with you.<br />
<br />
For my money, a healing upgrade about halfway between Druids and where they are now would suffice to reestablish them as a 'priest class', and solidify even more their desireablity as a group and a raid class, and amplify their solo ability. But not all the things they're asking for in that petition. <br />
<br />
So, after all that, you do actually agree that shaman could use some help.  But you add a caveat about 'not all the things they are asking for'.  Now let me take you to the post that Glorianna made at TNZ, and see her comments on this:<br />
<br />
We are definitely not asking for every suggestion to be fulfilled! <br />
<br />
Wow, they are not asking for everything as you are implying, just suggesting areas that they could be improved in.  Since you obviously did not actually read the thread you threw a hissy about, why don't you follow the link you posted, look at the suggestions they made, and you will see that in fact they are not unreasonable.  Since you mentioned healing, I will post their suggestions for possible healing fixes:<br />
<br />
* Some sort of group heal or group heal over time (with MGB option).<br />
* Some sort of upgrade to or improvement of Quiescence.<br />
* Some sort of faster, larger, and more efficient quick single-target heal, more on par with PoP mob damage<br />
* AA HOT ability<br />
<br />
Now which of those comes off as overpowered?  Remember, they are not asking for all those, only presenting a list ofways they think that healing could be upgraded for them.<br />
<br />
It is important to remember that even the most overpowered classes(to me that would be BL's, Bards, and Enchanters) do have legitimate class issues.  To dismiss them as whining, just because you don't play those classes, is unfair and shows a pettyness of mind.</div></div><hr />

It's as dishonest as the Paladins who wanted to keep Warriors in line solely because of /defensive and their lack thereof, without wanting to mention all the other things they brought to the table.<br />
<br />
 Shamans are some of the most efficient soloers in the game; they pay for that with long individual solo times.<br />
<br />
 Shamans are the best slowers in the game; whether or not you like to admit it, that 5%-20% that you insist is meaningless holds SOME sort of value to XP groups, as Shamans are at the top of the 'must-have' list along with Clerics and Enchanters.<br />
<br />
 Shamans are the third best healers in the game; they can't break into the top two because they ARE the best slowers in the game, but they are certainly number 3 solidly. <br />
<br />
 Shamans are highly valued for XP groups at all levels of grouping.<br />
<br />
 Shamans are highly valued in raid guilds at all levels of raiding.<br />
<br />
 Shamans are highly competent soloers.<br />
<br />
 To present a need for minor tweaking at best with statements like this,<br />
<br />
 The general consensus is that we have reached our pinnacle of usefulness in Kunark and have wound up at the bottom of the heap in just about any measure of class balance. <br />
<br />
 (Which, BTW, is blatantly untrue), does NOTHING to give them credibility in my eyes. (Which, since this was MY rant to begin with, is the most important set of oculars in the thread, IMNSHO :) )<br />
<br />
 I don't dismiss class issues as 'whining'. I dismiss hamhanded attempts to force the issue of upgrading with untrue and illogical statements about the class as it stands in EQ now as 'whining'. I especially despise it because they are subvocalizing the message 'Warriors got theirs, where's mine?'<br />
<br />
 (If you wish to argue this point, feel free. Go back and look at the post, they mention unhappiness over the last couple of years, so the Rangers intimate as well.

<br />
This statement is false.  Shaman can solo, but it is for little better if at all better than group exp.<br />
<br />
Shamans are the best slowers in the game <br />
<br />
This statement is true, they are.  Just as warriors are the best at absorbing damage.  Note tho that when you hit a point of slow enough, just like being able to absorb damage enough, there is a very limited retern.  5 - 20 % more slow is not enough alone to get a group.<br />
<br />
as Shamans are at the top of the 'must-have' list along with Clerics and Enchanters. <br />
<br />
This statement is false.  I would trade the cleric for a druid any day, and if I have an enchanter, why would I want a shaman?<br />
<br />
Shamans are the third best healers in the game; they can't break into the top two because they ARE the best slowers in the game, but they are certainly number 3 solidly.  <br />
<br />
This statement is misleading.  Shaman are the 3rd best healers, but barely.  Paladins heal almost as well as shaman.  They are far far far behind druids and clerics...clerics get a 7500 hp heal, druids best heal is 4680, shaman best heal is 1950.<br />
<br />
Shamans are highly valued for XP groups at all levels of grouping. <br />
<br />
To whom?  You?  Let me clue you in on a few things.  When I play my warrior main, I prefer idealy a BL as slower(more hp's, more attack, more DPS, and more mana for the casters).  When I play my number 1 alt, I want any class but a shaman, because shaman offer me nothing, while all other slower classes offer me improved mana regen, and bards also offer Rizlona's(sp?).  Just because you like to group with shaman does not mean they do not have issues.  I bring up again, that once perception catches up with reality, and people realize that a group with bard slower, a BL slower, or an enchanter slower is simply more efficient than one with a shaman slower, shaman desirability will take a nosedive.  Same thing happened to us.  Once people realized that knights could tank well enough, and had top agro, warrior group desirability took a nosedive.<br />
<br />
The general consensus is that we have reached our pinnacle of usefulness in Kunark and have wound up at the bottom of the heap in just about any measure of class balance.<br />
(Which, BTW, is blatantly untrue), does NOTHING to give them credibility in my eyes <br />
<br />
You repeatedly refer to them as beingthe best slower in the game.  This has been the center, the key to your argument.  Understand, Turgur's is a kunark spell!  Since then the idea of mitigation of slows has been introdued, which significantly reduces the effectiveness of that spell.  Shaman get their most powerfull, signature spell at level 51!<br />
<br />
 I dismiss hamhanded attempts to force the issue of upgrading with untrue and illogical statements about the class as it stands in EQ now as 'whining'<br />
<br />
Untrue and illogical because you disagree with them?  They all struck me as well thought out(well, the necro one was a little iffy), logical arguments.  Some I agreed with, some I did not.  But I certainly did not dismiss them as whining.  The only whining I saw was you at the thought other classes might actually want some love and attention as well.<br />
<br />
I especially despise it because they are subvocalizing the message 'Warriors got theirs, where's mine?' <br />
<br />
Please once again, go back and read the shaman post and show where it mentions warriors.  When you fail to find it, please admit that you are simply adding something that is not there.<br />
<br />
I have given you numbers, I have used logic, I have showed you what shaman spells actually can do, and all you have managed to come back with is the same tired, inaccurate, and misleeding comments...'but they slow a little better'(except 3 other classes slow almost as well, and well enough), 'but they have slightly better stat buffs'(that are mostly useless, and can be gotten from other classes), 'but they can solo'(slowly),' but people want them'(quantify this, or admit that it is simply perception, colored by your desire to have a shaman's agi buff).<br />
<br />
This is basically a whine forum, so if you want to whine, feel free.  Just don't think I won't excercise my right to call you on it, and point out the oh so many ways you are wrong.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is actually the point I was getting at, sorta.  Since knights can mitigate well enough, their agro lock becomes important.  Since other classes can slow enough, their other abilities become important.  Shaman are in somedanger of going down the road we went.<br />
<br />
Because we don't have aggro lock, an Enchanter is WAY more likely to be one rounded than a Shaman, why have an Enchanter to start with if you can buy KEI, and I cap with a Shaman's haste, plus any caster does more DPS than an Enchanter INCLUDING Shaman <br />
<br />
An enchanter who knows what they are doing, has up his rune, will very very rarely if ever get one rounded, and in fact can stand up to agro for extended periods of time by rune tanking.  I have seen this done.  Second, of the three tank classes, 2 do provide agro lock, meaning the enchanter is far less likely to even have to worry about agro.  Third, enchanters with CD pet(or better, CoD), fully hasted, plus nukes, will outdamage a shaman.  Enchanter best nuke is 1100, with a 6 second cast time, shaman's 925 with a 7.8 cast time.<br />
<br />
You still can heal me in a group, esp if you slow a mob, I two boxed a druid, without slow they are not that great, EVAC was a greater asset, because of MORONS training my pair <br />
<br />
Shaman are not asking to compete for main healing postition.  In a pinch, against easy content, shaman can heal a group while slowing.  Shaman healing is like pally healing tho usually...good for an emergency, and that is about it(note pallies have nearly the healing power of a shaman).  If a group has a cleric or druid, a shaman can be last choice for a slower, as the healing a shaman provides is not neccessary, and other classes offer more.<br />
<br />
Mitigation was added because slow is an overpowering spell, it trivializes many encounters that should be tough but now aren't or why change it <br />
<br />
Absolutely.  Slow mitigation is to make encounters more challenging, no doubt.  Mitigation also reduces the gap between shaman slows, and every one elses. <br />
<br />
You can lie and say soloing doesn't matter, but I wish Sony would nerf one of the soloing classes just so you can see the absulote screamfest that would occur. Soloing is important to obtain items in this game, cause there is WAY more greedy little shits than people want to admit clogging this game up! Being forced to group with morons is another disavantage <br />
<br />
I never said soloing did not matter, I said that saying shaman are one of the best slowers is not true.  Most classes that can solo effectivly, can solo more effectivly than a shaman.  This includes bards and enchanters, who are competing for that slowing spot in groups.<br />
<br />
Of course not, it is infered, just because warriors got looked at, means all the nuts will crawl out of the woodwork for OUTRAGEOUS claims, got a Ranger in my guild asking for Gate and more Druid abilities so he can quad more effectively, yes, he quads in his low-mid 50's <br />
<br />
You mistake perception for reality.  You believe that classes are asking for help because warriors got some help, you do not know this.  One ranger in ytour guild who is a fruitcake does not make all classes who ask for their issues to be looked at equally fruity.<br />
<br />
In closing your arguement that &quot;you would take a Beastlord over Shaman&quot; is misleading from a Warriors view point. <br />
<br />
I am a warrior, and I can tell you strait up, with no qualms or hesitation, that I would prefer a BL slower to a shaman slower hands down, as they bring more to a group.  I also prefer bard and enchanter slowers, as they bring more to a group than a shaman.<br />
<br />
Instead lets give the Beastlord the SAME ability to heal as you, plus all his extras, and take away your ability to solo, and now you know how a warrior feels compared to Knights. Then have everyone tell you to shut up, because you can slow better, but you never get a group, and can't solo. Thats how Warrior was <br />
<br />
Is there some point to this?  Yes, I remember the dark days(a couple months ago) when we as warriors where shunned from groups.  We needed help, and we needed it badly.  No one is trying to suggest that shaman have it that bad, or will.  This does not change the fact that the shaman class has issues, and they should be addressed.<br />
<br />
And Clerics get their signature spell at level 39.<br />
Concidentally, Complete Heal have been nerfed too.<br />
<br />
This doesn't make the spells any less powerful though.<br />
<br />
This is true.  Even shaman mostly admit the Turgurs was a mistake on SoE's part, and too powerfull, especially at the level it is gotten(same as cleric CH).  Trouble is, they do get it, and the game has been balanced around it.  When we were talking about getting warriors fixed, the subject of /disc defensive came up alot.  Many felt that this old Kunark era discipline was part of what was keeping us from getting upgrades.  This was a legitimate viewpoint, and thankfully SoE found a way around it.  Turgur's is the shaman version of /disc defensive...a very powerfull ability that limited them in other ways.  Hopefully, SoE will find a way to improve them as well, without breaking the game in other ways.</div></div><hr />

Procrastination on melee issues is the norm for Sony's &quot;Programmers&quot;. I do prefer a Beastlord be in group, but not as slower as DPS, throw in a Necromancer also, Bard, Cleric, Rogue. I still see no need for two TANKS, and this group doesn't represent the player's base class preference and population of classes. I don't think Necromancer, Druid, or Beatslord should be desired in a group. They can solo, LET THEM SOLO!

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mystaviant</div><div class="date">01-25-2004, 02:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I play a shaman, as the only character I play at all now.  I played a monk, a necro, and a bard to 55+, and found them unsuitable for my tastes.  The monk got hit with the nerf bat, and I was a semi-solo monk, and that killed him.  So I made the necro, and he was cool, but NEVER got groups.  So I made a group toon, the bard, and he was ok, but lacked the ability to solo indoors at all.  So I made a shaman.  GREAT solo ability (not the best exp-per-hour perhaps, but the best at making ANYTHING dead), good group ability, and decent raid ability.<br />
<br />
I often log in, go /lfg and then gate to my solo haven (nadox) and kill for exp, plat and drops.  It is more often than not that I can log in with a fresh KEI, solo for the entire duration, get another, kill for a bit, then log, and NEVER have gotten one tell for a group.<br />
<br />
This includes putting &quot;Full spellbook, XX AA's&quot; in the added comments, so everyone knows that I have malo and my slows will nearly NEVER bounce, maybe one bounce in 6 hours or so.<br />
<br />
Still, hours go by, not one invite.<br />
<br />
Not as bad as warriors, as I am getting 25% of an AA per hour or more, and if I ever level to 65, and get a few dots that don't break my root, I could root-rot in tier3+ and up that to an AA per hour or so.  So I am not sitting on my ass, but its not fun going for days w/o an invite.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So, yes, shamans DO have problems getting a group.<br />
<br />
Simple fix?<br />
<br />
Scale back chanter slow to 55%, BL slow to 40% and bard slow to 35%.  Drop my 60% haste down to 40% so people want chanters and bards for CC and haste, and give me a 60% or better pet haste, so my soloing won't suffer due to less haste on my doggie.  Hell, i want a 70% or so pet haste anyways.  Since there is the beginnings of the line there anyways.<br />
<br />
That would make shaman the #1 choice for slows.  Chanters and bards tied for haste and CC, and mana regen.<br />
<br />
Then groups would be:<br />
<br />
Tank<br />
Healer<br />
Chanter/Bard<br />
Shaman<br />
DPS/other<br />
DPS/other<br />
<br />
All other classes stack in group aside from clerics and slowers.  There aren't enough clerics to have more than one in a group, anyways, so thats not a concern.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I could certainly agree with that.  If I was to list classes in the order they need help from SoE, it would look like this:<br />
<br />
Mages<br />
warriors<br />
Monks<br />
Rogue/shaman<br />
...<br />
Enchanters<br />
Pallies<br />
Bards<br />
Beastlords<br />
<br />
<br />
Mages are in desperate need of help, and where even before the pet canni nerf hit.  People see them to much as solo classes, and post 60, mages are not strong soloers(outside charm solo, and that is a whole other issue...giving a class it's first charm at 65, and no ability to self rune, snare, or root is a cruel joke).  People see wizzies, rangers, rogues and BL's as higher DPS(with some justification, tho mages do shine in LDoN when given the chance), and nearly zero utility.<br />
<br />
Warriors are in much better shape, but still could use some help.  Knights are still the preffered exp tank, just by a smaller margin than before.<br />
<br />
Monks probably should be about the same level as mages in this list...but I don't play one, and it's my list:D .  Monks need a serious increase in power.<br />
<br />
Rogues and shaman are not in terrible straits right now, but both could have issues in the near future.  Rogues could use more DPS, shaman a boost in any of several area.<br />
<br />
Charm solo, long lasting mana regen buffs, DC or CoD pets for DPS in groups, best crowd controll, paci pulling, slows...Enchanters are a very strong class.<br />
<br />
Pallies still have it good, and need no real fixing.  Agro lock is intact, and they still tank well.<br />
<br />
Bards are if anything overpowered.  A group with a bard will kill faster than one without.  They enhace what everyone in the group does.  Combine this with being the hands down best pulling class, and bards are in very good shape.<br />
<br />
BL's are proof that the total can exceed the sum of the parts.  They can slow, can do DPS, can buff more hp's than their parent class, can buff attack more than their parent class, can take a hit better than their other parent class, do more DPS than either parent class, can solo, and are strongly desired for groups.<br />
<br />
Myst, you are never going to get a situation where one class is needed for an exp group.  Other slower classes have to be able to compete for the slower spot, shaman cannot have a lock on it.  Shaman need a little boost to be competative, but cannot be the sole slow class that groups want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">01-25-2004, 04:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well shamans have a point about BL's.  But like warriors, I don't think they are weak, they just suffer in comparison to their hybrid.  Beastlords have too many spells.  They shouldn't be able to slow more than 35% or so IMO.<br />
<br />
Rangers tanking like knights?  Whatever =P.</div></div><hr />

I think that is a SERVER population related problem, NOT class problem. If my Shaman is online, I get IMMEDIATE tells for groups on Tunare, my Warrior must start or seek one out. I don't have LDoN on the Shaman's account, or I would never be able to play my Warrior again!<br />
<br />
Here's my magelo http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=893697 I should have no problem getting groups, but when ZERO healers are available, I can't play! A monk even asked &quot;why are you level 57 and who did you MT (guild) for?&quot; He stated &quot;I knew you were MT for a heavy guild just by your play style, far superior to that of others your level&quot;.  I deleveled for plat for the most part, and to get away from the overcrowded 65 Tank crowd. That has done me little good (though it has helped) when a healer is unavailable, I have had druid and shaman MAIN healers (below 58th) MORE often than a Cleric! Your server population can effect group availability more than anything else!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daemonwynd</div><div class="date">01-25-2004, 06:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">5 - 20 % more slow is not enough alone to get a group.<br />
<br />
When looking for a slower, it's between you and a chanter, because you can both slow, and you can both debuff for slow to land easy. Bards and Beastlords beither are as good of slowers.<br />
 <br />
and if I have an enchanter, why would I want a shaman?<br />
<br />
That's a misleading argument, as those two classes are traditionally in competition for one role, that of slower/haster.<br />
<br />
Anyway.<br />
<br />
You would want a shaman in an exp group if you have an enchanter for the shaman's HP and stat buffs, his better slow, plus the shaman's ability to add decent DPS via DoTs, AS WELL AS the ability to perform as main healer for the group.<br />
 <br />
This statement is misleading.  Shaman are the 3rd best healers, but barely.  Paladins heal almost as well as shaman.  They are far far far behind druids and clerics...clerics get a 7500 hp heal, druids best heal is 4680, shaman best heal is 1950.<br />
<br />
Paladins can heal as well in terms on HPS healed at a time only. They cannot maintain the levels of healing required to perform as main healer for a group as a shaman can. Paladins are emergency healers, thier mana efficiency, skills, specialization, mana regen, etc, all reflect that. <br />
<br />
Take a pally's HoT, it does 900HP, almost as much as a shaman's 1200HoT, aye, but the pally pays 300mn for his, which if I remember correctly, is HALF AGAIN what the shaman pays? a pally could heal 1800in HoT spells for 600 mana, while the shaman can heal DOUBLE that, 3600, for the same mana. not to mention the pally doesn't have the ability to sit and med, as he's almost ALWAYS busy in melee... nor does he have cann, both of which make a massive difference.<br />
<br />
Shamans can get the job done, due to their mana regen ability via cann, and a HoT that's among the most efficient in the game.<br />
 <br />
 I prefer idealy a BL as slower(more hp's, more attack, more DPS, and more mana for the casters). <br />
<br />
I have to agree with Partha here. I prefer shamans, due to better  HP buffs, good DPS via DoT's, plus better haste. better slow, and better debuffs which = more damage for the casters.<br />
<br />
 I bring up again, that once perception catches up with reality, and people realize that a group with bard slower, a BL slower, or an enchanter slower is simply more efficient than one with a shaman slower.<br />
<br />
I disagree that that is actually the case.<br />
<br />
Since then the idea of mitigation of slows has been introdued, which significantly reduces the effectiveness of that spell.<br />
<br />
This mitigation makes ALL slows less effictive, so it hasn't changed a thing in relative terms... shaman slow abilities are less powerful; so are beastlord slows, bard slows, and enchanter slows.<br />
<br />
Clerics get their signature spell at 39, warriors their signature ability at level 55. It doesn't change anything.<br />
<br />
Your comment about shamns having better stat buffs... but you can get them from other classes... Tell me, where can you get FoS? Endurance of the boar? Talisman of the Daiku? Right. Only form a shaman.</div></div><hr />

Tank<br />
Healer<br />
Chanter/Bard<br />
Shaman<br />
DPS/other<br />
DPS/other<br />

So where does this leave us if a server has 25% of the player base as Warriors and about the same or more as Druid? That IS the situation on Tunare!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bsts can buff more hps than shamans.  Bsts and chanters do more dps than a shaman can with dots (especially with a warrior tank, since most dots are very high aggro).  And bsts buff more atk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daemonwynd</div><div class="date">01-25-2004, 08:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How is this? <br />
<br />
The only buff that I'm aware of that shamans DON'T get that beastlords do is SV, and their other stamina, stat, and hitpoint buffs are markedly inferior.<br />
<br />
I'd be genuinely interested to see how beastlords can buff more HPS, and how exactly that they do it.<br />
<br />
As for a chanter doing more DPS than a shaman? Not unless they have a pet, which has a high risk vs reward. shaman DPS doesn't carry that risk.<br />
<br />
Beastlords, yup, course they do more DPS, I'm not arguing that. But  shmans do decent DPS themselves.<br />
<br />
And, again, there's the better slow, better debuffs, better haste, and better stat buffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daemonwynd</div><div class="date">01-25-2004, 08:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">nevermind, looking up some spells and calculating quickly, I see Beastlords at 905HP total if they can use all of IoS, talisman, stamina, and SV.<br />
<br />
Shamans hit 844HP with Fo7th and sta.<br />
<br />
That's a 60 point advantage, IF the BST's spells ALL are permitted to be used. All of these buffs have better versions by shamans and BSS, so I submit that that's a rare case.<br />
<br />
I feel shamans in experience groups will be shown to buff more HPS on average than the bst.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">01-25-2004, 09:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bsts - Talisman and SV - 620<br />
Shaman - Focus - 544<br />
<br />
Stamina is a seperate situation since it can be capped, and amount of hps it gives can change per person<br />
Bsts - IoS, Fero, Stamina - 125<br />
Shaman - Boar - 60<br />
<br />
Atk<br />
Bst - Fero, SV - 190<br />
Shaman - FA, Bih'li - 155<br />
<br />
As for stacking issues, we are discussing shaman vs bst, so I don't think it would make sense to include that Focus and sta will overwrite bst versions.<br />
<br />
The only other stacking issue is with a ranger or paladin, IF someone decides to use the buff from the other hybrid, then yes they don't give as many hps, but thats more of a choice than straight fact (as some may prefer the bst version for the atk over brells, or maybe for hps over SoT).  Unlike a paladins symbol when you have a cleric, where it's a straight upgrade.  I don't see this as a rare case, how often do you make sure you have brells before you go exp?  Most people go with the buffs the group can give, and you don't always have a pally in your group.<br />
<br />
Since we're adding notes, I guess I should include that Bih'li can only be cast outdoors, though you can cast before going into a dungeon it only lasts 36 mins.<br />
<br />
As for better slow, it's only 10%.  How noticable that is in an exp group setting is as noticable as the difference between a warrior and paladin tanks.  No one gives a shit that it's minorly better considering what other classes bring to the table.<br />
<br />
About haste.  Bst haste is 50%, which is the same percent as the group haste shamans get.  Though shamans can use 60% single target haste, once again not a big difference.<br />
<br />
Stat buffs are worthless.  If you are getting agi cast on you, then there is nothing I can really say to you to explain it.  A smart shaman may as well delete wrulan from his spell book for all the good it does.<br />
<br />
Now debuff is a place where shamans are actually ahead of bsts, I will give you that.<br />
<br />
In closing, the fact that bsts can buff hps, sta, and atk more than shamans makes me sick.  Their haste is similar, their slow is more than enough (considering bards 52% is enough), and their dps is leaps and bounds ahead.  This is one over powered class that needs a massive strike from the nerf bat.  I don't think they should have the option of the talisman line at all if they are given SV, or maybe make it so SV doesn't stack with the talisman line (but does stack with focus line).  Also Fero was a fuck up if I ever saw one, same with them getting a PC haste.  I agree with Brutul, their slow should never have been over 35%.</div></div><hr />

Which really doesn't matter anyway, as BihLi is only 15 atk.<br />
<br />
About haste. Bst haste is 50%, which is the same percent as the group haste shamans get. Though shamans can use 60% single target haste, once again not a big difference.<br />
<br />
Actually, it makes all the difference in the world. Bst casting haste on you, you'll never reach haste cap. With a shaman, you will. If, of course, you've raided anythint NToV+.<br />
<br />
While we're adding notes, avatar adds 140 to all stats including str, which can also add up to 140atk by itself, putting shaman atk buffing back on top. Wayyyyy on top. Plus dex, which is capped less easily, which adds to procs, plus agility, which adds to AC. beastlord buffs will add to none of those.<br />
<br />
Not that stats usually mean much elemental+, anyway, but they do make a difference for those not lucky enough to cap stats.<br />
<br />
No one gives a shit that it's minorly better considering what other classes bring to the table. <br />
<br />
It's not MINORLY better. That 10% is a large difference. Like a 30% decrease in attacks... with no slow, a mob attacks, say, 10 times a second. With 65% slow, it attacks 3.5 times every 10 seconds, with 75% slow, it attacks 2.5 times every 10 seconds. So a mob that's bst slowed will attack nearly HALF AGAIN as fast as a shaman slowed mob. That's far more than the 10% that you'd think it would be.<br />
<br />
It's a common bitch to hear about beastlords, about their damn slow not landing... it makes a big difference being able to debuff.</div></div><hr />

I'm not even in VT yet, and I can tell you stats mean jack shit.  I have 124 agi, and don't cap unless I have FA and chanter haste, but that still doesn't mean agi is worth anything.<br />

No, stats are not at ALL useless. stats on buffs and items are useless when you're capped, but not until then. Except for agi, which as far as I can tell is completely useless.<br />

The order of efffectiveness is not changed, but the difference is reduced.  At 25 % mitigated slow, a shaman slow is 56.25 %, an enchante slow is 52.5 %, a BL slow is 48.75 % and a bard slow is 39 %.  Notice how the range of difference has changed dramataically.<br />

I am almost consciously shedding str from items, I cap strength with any strength buff.  Sta unbuffed for me is 280, with PP2, I gain a whole 30 hp's from a sta buff.

<br />
Seriously, try some groups with healer, bard, you 3 DPS and watch the exp flow in.  Bards slow is certainly good enough outside of the toughest zones, and what else they add to a group is unreal.<br />

<br />
I believe your conclusion is in error.  As I understand it(and I may be wrong, please let me know if I am...and I am sure you will:) ) the easiest way to understand slow effectiveness is to consider that it directly lowers mob DPS.  A mob 75 % slowed will do 75 % less DPS.  A mob 70 % slowed will do 70 % less DPS.<br />
<br />
Nooooo, I'm not bitter. I'm just over here feigned in the corner. <br />

If it makes you feel any better, I and I think most others here agree with you that monks have gotten the shaft, and need looking at probably before any other class(tho I prefer warrior and mage improvements, for purly selfish reasons...and mages are nearly as badly off as manks...maybe worse)<br />

This sounds like the argument about Pally and Cleric buffs, and everyone points to the whole 'you need 3 Pally buffs to situationally top one Cleric buff'. /shrug<br />
<br />
 As for better slow, it's only 10%. How noticable that is in an exp group setting is as noticable as the difference between a warrior and paladin tanks. No one gives a shit that it's minorly better considering what other classes bring to the table. <br />
<br />
 As for better slow, it's only 10% when the BL is 65 and has a full spellbook. (Yes, shocking, it's true, but most BST's aren't 65, and even many 65's haven't ponied up the money for that slow yet.) In that case, it's a 20% difference at least- one seen from level 51 on up. Wanna argue that a 20% difference in slow is insignificant? If so, next time you fight a good mitigating mob, be sure and tell the raid leader that you're not slowing because 20% isn't a big difference. Then tell us how long it was before they /guildremoved you. :D <br />
<br />
If it is such a large difference, then how do bards get groups for slow, when theirs is only 52%? Done LDoN high risk with bards repeatedly, and shamans really aren't that much more powerful. <br />
<br />
 I don't think they get groups solely for slow, that's how. They're also the A-Number One pullers in LDoN by a large margin, can CC, can OVERHASTE (But that's only 15% or so until Rizlona's, so I guess that's marginal :p ), can debuff, can do an amazing number of things, not the least of which being mana regen.<br />
<br />
 But, of course, once again, it's Paladin-style arguing going on here: Maximize the opposition's abilities, minimize your own, or dismiss them altogether if you can, and if you can't, assert that whatever advantage you have is meaningless, regardless of the numbers.</div></div><hr />

Quite humorous coming from you, especially after you put this at the top:<br />
<br />
the BST only gets his advantage by casting 2-3 buffs to the Shaman's 1 in each line <br />
<br />
Isn't that exactly what you are doing?  Oh sure, he can buff more hps and atk than a shaman, but he has to use more buff slots, so it doesn't count!  Exact same tactic as you listed.  Come in here, tell us we're wrong without many numbers, then call us paladins.  Not much of a better debating tactic either.<br />
<br />
Wanna argue that a 20% difference in slow is insignificant <br />
<br />
Bard slow works good enough for an exp group, and it is 23% less than shaman slow.  So yes, I will argue that 20% is insignificant for an exp group (repeating this since even though I've mentioned it repeatedly, you brought up a raid).<br />
<br />
I don't think they get groups solely for slow, that's how. They're also the A-Number One pullers in LDoN by a large margin, can CC, can OVERHASTE (But that's only 15% or so until Rizlona's, so I guess that's marginal  ), can debuff, can do an amazing number of things, not the least of which being mana regen. <br />
<br />
Is kinda my point.  Bard slow is good enough to do the job of the slower in exp groups, and then they bring all those nice things you listed too.<br />
<br />
Shamans have a higher slow, and of course it's better.  They also are decently good buffers.  Their healing is not in line with being a priest class though.  But, the sum of all the things a shaman brings to the table including better slows is not greater than the sum the other things different classes bring with their slows being good enough for an exp group.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, there's several problems with that group. A bard can only do so many things at once.... and when you're making him do all those things, he starts sucking at each of them. So you take him doing haste, mana, slow, you don't get haste cap, or any kind of good slow. Soon as you get an add, buffs have to go out the window because bard has to mez... get 2 adds, you're in some trouble. He can't mez multiples, AND slow, and buff. No, that's not a balanced group, or a group that's going to deal with any kind of trouble very easily. No, I'd have to take a shaman or a chanter in the group, so the bard isn't doing all the work, and allow the group more of a chance to live with the crap hitrs the fan. That, and the bard's songs work well in tandem with both classes.<br />
Unless you're fighting in areas where the difficulty is trivial for you...<br />
<br />

Yes, that's exactly how it works.<br />
A mob unslowed, say, does 250DPS. a mob 52% slowed does what, 120DPS. 65% slowed,  86DPS. 75% slowed, 62DPS. So, a mob that's bard slowed will do TWICE the DPS of a mob that's shaman slowed, and a mob that's 65% slowed will do 132%  of the DPS of a mob that's slowed 75% (82/62 = 1.32). Whoops, you're right, it wasn't half again. it was 30% more. My bad. /shrug, I knew it was far more than the 10% you'd think, anyway.</div></div><hr />

Since where shaman want help is at 65, bringing up that BL's don't get there best slow till 65 is kinda foolish.<br />
<br />
Wanna argue that a 20% difference in slow is insignificant? <br />
<br />
Yes I do.  The point of slow is to reduce a mobs damage output, and thereby reduce the amount of healing needed to a managable level, and reduce the likelyhood of a player dying.  On exp  mobs, an extra 20 % slow is not that huge a slow.  Note only bards of the 4 slow classes uses a slow that much lower that a shaman.<br />
<br />
I don't think they get groups solely for slow, that's how. <br />
<br />
Exactly, bards bring a shitload of other things to a group becides slow, and that, in conjunction with slow, makes a package that is greater than a shaman's package.  BLs and enchanters do as well.<br />
<br />

<br />
Funny, when we were hurting most, and needed help, paladin's where one of the most vocal communities supporting us.  Not all paladin's, but most did say that we needed help badly, even tho we were in direct competition with them for group spots.  Thank you for insulting a group of people who did what good they could for us, and supported us(with exceprtions).  If you care to actually offer a reasoned argument at some point, I will listen, but your attempt at a low blow there failed miserably.<br />
<br />
Again, as I said, stats are useless AFTER they are capped, but not until then. <br />
<br />

<br />
Sorry for cutting up your paragraph, just trying to get to the meat of the thing, so here goes...Where do most people exp at 65?  LDoN normal, PoV/BoT/HoH.  Difficulty in those zones is  trivial.  Noter also that as bards are arguably the best puller in the game, that trying to mez a bunch of mobs and do everything else is not going to happen much, if at all.<br />
<br />
A mob unslowed, say, does 250DPS. a mob 52% slowed does what, 120DPS. 65% slowed, 86DPS. 75% slowed, 62DPS. So, a mob that's bard slowed will do TWICE the DPS of a mob that's shaman slowed, and a mob that's 65% slowed will do 132% of the DPS of a mob that's slowed 75% (82/62 = 1.32). Whoops, you're right, it wasn't half again. it was 30% more.  <br />
<br />
Even that is misleading.  Comparing aginst unslowed DPS provides meaningfull numbers, comparing final DPS numbers as a percentage is not.  Also, the issue is whether 52 % slow(or 65, or 70 %, depending on class) is enough.  Once you cross that magic threshold, and DPS is lowered enough that healer mana is not an issue, extra is not a big deal.<br />
<br />
A bard slower in a BoT group where the tank doesn't have his defensive AA's, and/or doesn't have great gear, is a good way to get that tank killed... krigers, anyone? <br />
<br />
Hmm...I could tank krigers at 65, with almost no defensive aa's, with little issue, with a BL slowing(my firswt BoT group, I remember it well still...was so exciting at the time).  It was mana intensive on the cleric, but not bad.  We still chain pulled all day long.  I admit with a bard it would have been a bit more iffy.  Flash forward to taday, and I could do that with no issue at all. <br />
<br />
Understand that shaman fully admit that pre 65, they are in decent shape, and around level 60, are very powerfull.  Where they start having trouble is in the 65 plus AA's area.  When groups have enough aa's, good enough gear, etc, that 75 % slow is not needed or even particularly advantageous, then othe classes start being more desirably by far than shaman, they offer more.<br />
<br />
A bard slower in elemental isn't going to cut it, either, until and unless the tank is very well geared and AA'd. <br />
<br />
True, but what percentage of people exp in the elemental planes?  Most people(even elemental flagged people) exp mostly on trivial type mobs...BoT/HoH/Tactics/LDoN normal.  In those zones, against those mobs, bard slow, BL slow, enchanter slow is more than enough.  Flash back to my first BoT group, with a BL slower, I was working on ND3, using a GSoT, with 2 pieces of Myrmidon armor(gloves and boots) as my best armor...and the cleric was able to melee and occasionally nuke while we kept a mob in camp continuously.  This is what most people are exping on, not elemental, or LDoN hard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">01-26-2004, 04:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, actually, it is.<br />
<br />
We both know what a shaman brings, and what other classes bring by this point.  I personally do not view it as enough, as do most shamans and people who deal with shamans often that I speak to.  Just saying yes or no isn't much of an arguement though.  Especially since we've already discussed the facts and still disagree.<br />
<br />
A bard slower in a BoT group  <br />
<br />
Obviously there are times when a bard won't work.   There are times when a shaman won't work (low dps group in a situation with a time limit).  And a chanter won't work with a low aggro warrior and mobs that need fast tash and slow.  A bst doesn't really work with really resistant mobs.  Though I've used a bard as main puller, slower, cc in quite a few high risk LDoN missions, without any problems (this was in gear a good bit worse than my current, still below VT atm).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kilaara</div><div class="date">01-26-2004, 06:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One thing to mention about slow.<br />
<br />
Shaman 75<br />
chanter 70<br />
Beastlord 65<br />
Bard 52 (?)<br />
<br />
So you can say its only 5 / 10 / 23 % more or less, but thats not the real part.<br />
<br />
A shaman slowed Mob (fullslow) may dish out 100 dps( 25 % of 400 dps)<br />
The same mob slowed by a chanter will dish out 120 dps( 30 % of 400 dps). <br />
And when slowed by a Beastlord it will dish out 140 dps (35 % of 400 dps).<br />
And finally when slowed by bardslow it will dish out 192 dps ( 48 % of 400 dps)<br />
<br />
As to say it shaman slow ist 20 % more effectiv than chanter slow, 40 % more effectiv than beastlord slow and finally 92 % more effectiv than bardslow.<br />
<br />
But a slowed mob is alltime better than an unslowed one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daemonwynd</div><div class="date">01-26-2004, 07:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Exactly, bards bring a shitload of other things to a group becides slow, and that, in conjunction with slow, makes a package that is greater than a shaman's package.  BLs and enchanters do as well.<br />
Actually, to be precise, bards only bring 2 other things besides slow to a group. Where chanters can mez multiple targets, plus give mana regen, haste, debuff, and slow, a bard is limited to 3 of those at a time via twisting. If he's mezzing 2 and slowing 1, he's not giving any mana regen or haste to the group, like the chanter is able to. If he's hasting, mana regenning, and slowing the mob, he's not able to do all those plus CC a mob, while a chanter can. That's why I like to use bards to augment and complement present group abilities, not replace them altogether, because they just don't replace entire ability sets very well.<br />
<br />
And again, my point is that it is very easy to cap them.<br />
No argument there, when you hit level 65, and if you raid or have a lot of plat, anyway. Even when they're at 305.<br />
<br />
Sorry for cutting up your paragraph, just trying to get to the meat of the thing, so here goes...Where do most people exp at 65?  LDoN normal, PoV/BoT/HoH.  Difficulty in those zones is  trivial.  <br />
They also normally have the gear to match for that kind of playing level. <br />
<br />
Noter also that as bards are arguably the best puller in the game, that trying to mez a bunch of mobs and do everything else is not going to happen much, if at all.<br />
<br />
Yeah, and while the bard's off pulling, the mana song fades, the haste song fades, etc, and it takes a few ticks to get them going even after the bard gets back, so there's significant durations where the group isn't getting the benefit of the bard's spells.<br />
<br />
Even that is misleading.<br />
No, it's not. It takes the abstract slow percentages and translates them into what that means the mob's going to actually do to you with the different slowers slowing. A 75% slow is NOT half again better than a 50% slow, it's TWICE as good.<br />
<br />
Comparing aginst unslowed DPS provides meaningfull numbers, comparing final DPS numbers as a percentage is not. <br />
I gave both. And they are CERTAINLY both meaningful.<br />
<br />
Hmm...I could tank krigers at 65, with almost no defensive aa's, with little issue, with a BL slowing(my firswt BoT group, I remember it well still...was so exciting at the time).  It was mana intensive on the cleric, but not bad.<br />
<br />
Yeah. A beastlord slowing. Not a bard....<br />
<br />
When groups have enough aa's, good enough gear, etc, that 75 % slow is not needed or even particularly advantageous, then othe classes start being more desirably by far than shaman, they offer more.<br />
<br />
They don't offer more, they just offer different things. Case in point Beastlords, they don't offer debuffs or the ability to act as main healer, do they?<br />
<br />
Ever tried a shaman as healer and slower, with a tank, bard, DPS, DPS, DPS? Yeah, that's some fast keelin.<br />
<br />
Most people(even elemental flagged people) exp mostly on trivial type mobs...BoT/HoH/Tactics/LDoN normal.  In those zones, against those mobs, bard slow, BL slow, enchanter slow is more than enough.<br />
<br />
You seem to be focusing on all of them like I claimed none of the other slowers were good enough. Other than bards as an absolute last resort as a slower, the other two ARE good enough slowers to fill that role. Chanters being so close to shamans as to make no real discernible difference, due to their debuff ability.<br />
<br />
If I look for a slower, I look for a shaman for his slows, buffs, ability to also add damage, ability to form as primary healer, as well as ability to buff MY damage, unless I need to have a slower and CC, in which case I look for a chanter.</div></div><hr />

Bards can easily twist more than 3 songs at a time, and many songs provide more than one effect(Rilzona's for example).<br />
<br />
No, it's not. It takes the abstract slow percentages and translates them into what that means the mob's going to actually do to you with the different slowers slowing. A 75% slow is NOT half again better than a 50% slow, it's TWICE as good. <br />
<br />
No, that is simply not true.  A 75 % slow reduces 75 % of a mobs damage, a 50 % reduces it by 50 %.  That is not twice as much.  You can try amd juggle numbers around to make it look like it, but it is not true.  You are reducing  damage taken.  Therefore, the key is to look at how much damage is reduced.  Another way to think of it, a mob does say 400 DPS.  A shaman reduces it DPS by 300, a bard by 200.  That is not twice as good.<br />
<br />
Yeah. A beastlord slowing. Not a bard.... <br />
<br />
Yes, there are 4 slow classes, bards are only one.  Note that now, I can tank a kriger with absolutly no difficulty just bard slowed.<br />
<br />
They don't offer more, they just offer different things. Case in point Beastlords, they don't offer debuffs or the ability to act as main healer, do they? <br />
<br />
Shaman can make ok main healers against trivial content.  Trouble is first time they bounce a couple slows(and it does happen).  Then they are reduced to spam healing just trying to keep up with the damage the tank is taking, if they have not pulled agro themsleves.  Shaman are not good main healers, certainly 3rd choice for that role.  My argument is that they are the things they bring to a group besides slow is less than other slow classes.<br />
<br />
Ever tried a shaman as healer and slower, with a tank, bard, DPS, DPS, DPS? Yeah, that's some fast keelin. <br />
<br />
I would rather replace the shaman with a druid in that case, let bard slow.  Druid does more DPS, heals better, and the bard can cover slows well enough.  Now we are talking fast killing.<br />
<br />
If I look for a slower, I look for a shaman for his slows, buffs, ability to also add damage, ability to form as primary healer, as well as ability to buff MY damage, unless I need to have a slower and CC, in which case I look for a chanter. <br />
<br />
I look first for a BL...more hp's for me, more attack for melee, more DPS, and more mana regen for casters, next a bard, who makes a group stronger in so many ways, then an enchanter(more DPS, free crack for the casters), and lastly a shaman.  Note that with a chanter in group, it is usually very easy to trade KEI for shaman buffs, and not have an extra low DPS class ingroup.</div></div><hr />

Discounting AoEs or freaky ripostes, that 75% slow will require half as many heals on the MT as the 50% slow. Of course, this is in a perfect situation when the MT absorbs all damage, which of course doesn't happen =) But, I don't see how you condemn &quot;juggling numbers&quot; when you in fact are basically doing the same thing to suit your argument.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 But, the sum of all the things a shaman brings to the table including better slows is not greater than the sum the other things different classes bring with their slows being good enough for an exp group. <br />
<br />
 Understand that shaman fully admit that pre 65, they are in decent shape, and around level 60, are very powerfull. Where they start having trouble is in the 65 plus AA's area. When groups have enough aa's, good enough gear, etc, that 75 % slow is not needed or even particularly advantageous, then othe classes start being more desirably by far than shaman, they offer more. <br />
<br />
 So, what Hussar is looking for is to have, in addition to the best slows in the game, is a total package that is greater than any other slower's total package.<br />
<br />
 And what Redhenna is looking for is a 'fix' for 65+AA Shamans specifically, since she admits that, prior to 65, Shamans are 'very powerful'.<br />
<br />
 Hate to break it to the both of you, but 1-65 you guys are pretty honestly thought of as one of THE most well-balanced classes in EQ. I'll keep repeating, but there is NO area in the game in which Shamans are weak or unnecessary. Situationally, there may be times when it's better to have a lesser slower, but once again, that's hardly unique to any class, nor does it validate incorrect and misleading rubbish like<br />
<br />
 The general consensus is that we have reached our pinnacle of usefulness in Kunark and have wound up at the bottom of the heap in just about any measure of class balance. <br />

Fix archery so arrows don't poof on walled MOBs.  That's the only change the highest DPS class needs.  If you really look at rangers, no other class and deliver NEARLY as much DPS as they do without getting summoned and killed.  They have the lowest aggro DPS available to anyone.<br />
<br />
Shaman<br />
This is one of the most powerful classes in the game and no fixes are needed.  The have the BEST debufs and slows.  In many group situations, they can play the role of a cleric and still out damage a warrior with their DoT's.  In raid situation, a single shaman can mean the difference between success and failure.<br />

<br />
This is true, but how you measure the effectiveness of slow is in how mych damage it reduces.  To put it in terms of heals as you did, and using easy numbers...if a mob requires the tank to be healed 4 times unslowed, then with a bard slow it will take 2 less heals, and with a shaman 3 less heals.  You are goinf from one amount of healing needed, to a lesser amount, and so to measure effectiveness, you look at how much less.  It's a minor point, but that is technically how it works.<br />
<br />
And what Redhenna is looking for is a 'fix' for 65+AA Shamans specifically, since she admits that, prior to 65, Shamans are 'very powerful'. <br />

Yes, that is exactly right.  At the end game, the '65+AA' crowd(where a very large portion of the EQ population is), shaman have some very real issues.<br />
<br />
but there is NO area in the game in which Shamans are weak or unnecessary.  <br />
<br />
Care to back that up?  Healing, a shaman is very weak(best heal in less than half the best druid heal, and barely better than a pallies), DPS, shaman are weak.  You have said nothing to refute this, so how can you apply a blanket statement that they are 'no areas...which shaman are weak'?<br />
<br />
Situationally, there may be times when it's better to have a lesser slower, but once again, that's hardly unique to any class, nor does it validate incorrect and misleading rubbish like <br />

Shaman are not asking to be '&gt; everybody else', they are asking for some small upgrades to keep them viable, as they are more and more loosing that viability.  Go thru the list of options for upgrades that shaman gave, point out the ones that look overpowering...I bet you don't find any.</div></div><hr />

A better comparison is priest on UNSLOWED MOBs to shaman on 75% SLOWED MOBs.  That is why shaman are such capable healers.  By significantly reducing the DPS of the MOB, they also reduce the amount of healing required by 75% on melee MOBs.  <br />
<br />
Mathematically speaking, shaman only need 25% of the healing of other priest, but they are more than that (~40%) so they are ahead.<br />

As for shaman DPS, they can easily do 5K+ of damage (w/o focus items) with just two DoTs in less time than it takes for a warrior to do 5K.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Cute...<br />
Debuffs? You do realize that mages share our Mala line right?<br />
The unresistable ones, malo and malos, are only effective singling against exp mobs. Raid mobs still require, tash, bard debuffs and then its required to go back over malo,malos with malosine. <br />
Necros have better disease debuffs than shamans do.<br />
<br />
Damage? Shamans best Dot is Bane (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4095&amp;source=Live) , at level 64. For 490 mana, with no resist check, Shamans get a 30 second dot with a 24 second recast time. With todays DPS and MOB TTL(Time to live) at or less than 30 seconds, Shamans would have to do nothing but dot, to be able to contribute fully to a mobs death. Which means your taking more damage and needing more mana to heal. Take into account that Malo or Malos is ussually required to slow a mob your looking at a total of 8 seconds to slow a mob and 650 mana before you can do other things, like add damage...<br />
<br />
Slow? Yes shaman have the best slows in the game, by 5%. But when Sony introduced slow mitigate the playing field suddenly doesn't look as one sided as it once did. Once mitigation kicks in a BST slow is less than 3% as effective as the shaman slow. <br />
<br />
Raid? Bling bling bling, your right ONE shaman can make or break a raid. Hence we've said along that we don't stack well on raids... <br />
Dots? Lets hope that Necros aren't there becuase 4 necros would fill up a mobs buff counters pretty quick(after debuffs)... <br />
<br />
Your blanket statement is so full of holes its not even funny. Actually had this been posted 3 expansions ago you would have been right, but saddly your not... The playing field has changed and with each expansion the shamans precieved power errodes more and more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Shaman have it good in xp groups.  The fact that they can solo well (and they can as I often have my shaman soloing the little named guys in Droga for cash, something not many other classes have all the tools to solo) means something is sacrificed.<br />
<br />
So you guys don't stack on raids?  Bid deal, not many classes do.<br />
<br />
For the shaman previously who said he has trouble getting groups, probably your reputation has gotten you to that point. <br />
<br />
As for competition for slowers.  Every group needs one and there are never enough to go around.  I always look for a shaman first (being for reasons that enchanters tashing then slowing is an agro nightmare if I'm the MT, so I still prefer shaman)  As far as Beastlords, I have run into some who don't have the 65 slow spell and then you get stuck with a subpar slower.  So if a shaman is out there I go with him first.</div></div><hr />

Shaman have it fucking good right now, and a lot of them don't know it because they have bad reps or bad gear or no spells or whatever.  Shamans make or break groups.  They're a chanter and a healer rolled up in one.  Quiescense and Tnarg are sufficient for healing, if you took the time work on some AA's to make them sufficient.  A 2100/2400 Heal over time, and crit 3016 heals are more than adequate to keep a tank alive against a slowed XP mob.  Damage?  Well, i've got news for you, shaman aren't getting groups for fucking damage.  I know it's nice to see that you did XXX to each mob, but that's not why people pick shaman up for groups.  Work on the Fury AA's and use Velium Strike with a ID4 item and you contribute just fine.  <br />
<br />
The more AA's I get, the less I think that shaman need anything.  Other classes are balanced a bit high against them tho.  Beastlords probably shouldn't get the 65 slow, and the druid 64 heal doesn't need to be QUITE so impressive compared to the shaman one.  Other than that, I don't see much to bitch about.

<br />
 If you define ~5-10% as 'very large', I might even agree with you. Better stated, however, is that ~90-95% of all Shamans have NO real issues, are well balanced, and powerful. Not to say that their 'pinnacle was Kunark' and not to say that they are 'ineffective' and 'bring a smaller total package to the table than other classes'.<br />
<br />
 Care to back that up?  <br />
<br />
 Already have, although you've mistaken my point that they are viable and wanted and powerful in different situations as saying they're strong in all the things they do. That's not what I meant.<br />
<br />
 I meant that Shamans, as they are now with no modifications, are good soloers, good in groups, and good in raids. If you wish to dispute that, then I truly can't say anything to you, since you are convinced of your doom beyond all rational expectations.<br />
<br />
It is never 'better' to have a lesser slow, but when the lesser slowers bring more to an exp group almost every time, then there is an issue. <br />
<br />
 Except that what they bring is not better. What they bring is different and can't be compared. If you really want to compare, tho, let's try.<br />

 With the healing, I used just healing, not mitigation. I guess if you want to talk mitigation, you'd talk ENC, and then BL, SHM, and BRD, I'd guess. The other 3 are so far behind Enchanters in that respect, tho, that it doesn't really matter what order you stick them in.</div></div><hr />

BL Healing. If the BST is pet healing they far out heal a Shaman. As they have direct pet heals for 1200pts. And if the BST is going to be healing they sure as hell are going to be healing their pets...<br />

You haven't made one arguement yet that has been worth a damn, in fact, you primarily are just attacking people.  Pathetic.<br />
<br />
So, what Hussar is looking for is to have, in addition to the best slows in the game, is a total package that is greater than any other slower's total package. <br />
<br />
No.  People were saying shamans package was greater than others, so I said it wasn't greater than.  No where have I remotely asked for shamans to be more powerful than other classes.  I believe they should be balanced, not stuck in a shit position because their slow is a small amount more than others.<br />
<br />
My opinion on upgrades is to have them have heals that are in line with being a priest class (still less than druids of course).  Also, an aa group heal that can be MGB'd (along the lines of celestial regen, spirit of the wood, paragon).  And maybe a bit less aggro on dots (it's not like they are very powerful in an exp setting right now, since most mobs die too fast for them to really be worth the mana cost).  Nothing overpowering.<br />
<br />
If you define ~5-10% as 'very large' <br />
<br />
Um, no.  65+aa is a very large percent</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daemonwynd</div><div class="date">01-26-2004, 05:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, that is simply not true.  A 75 % slow reduces 75 % of a mobs damage, a 50 % reduces it by 50 %.  That is not twice as much.<br />
<br />
I never SAID it was twice as MUCH, I said it was twice as GOOD.<br />
<br />
The FACT of the matter is, in real terms, the healer with a bard slower in the group is gonna be healing TWICE as much as the healer with a shaman in the group. That's a FACT. And that's what my point is based on.<br />
<br />
Yes, there are 4 slow classes, bards are only one.  Note that now, I can tank a kriger with absolutly no difficulty just bard slowed.<br />
And I can tank one without even being bard slowed. Your point? =) I think you're losing the original thread, where I was talking about krigers sucking enough, bard slowed and for most people that XP there, that they want something better for slower.<br />
 <br />
Shaman can make ok main healers against trivial content.<br />
Isn't that your whole argument about &quot;good enough&quot; being so very powerful? And they're not JUST main healers, they're the only class in the game that can do both. They can make good main healers if someone else is doing the slowing too, against more than just trivial content. 2kHoTs that cost well under 200mn after specialization and mana pres and IH AA's will do that, especially when you have cann4.<br />
<br />
<br />
Shaman are not good main healers, certainly 3rd choice for that role.<br />
No argument there, only clerics are &quot;good&quot; main healers, IMO. But again, they bring what no other class in the game does, the ability to heal AND slow AND debuff AND do damage too.<br />
<br />
My argument is that they are the things they bring to a group besides slow is less than other slow classes.<br />
And my argument is that it's not. Now that we got THAT clarification out of the way...<br />
<br />
 I would rather replace the shaman with a druid in that case, let bard slow.  Druid does more DPS, heals better, and the bard can cover slows well enough.  Now we are talking fast killing.<br />
I notice you extolling the virtues on the druid... What I don't see you mentioning is losing the shaman's haste, and therefore the bard's overhaste, losing the shaman's HP buffs, losing the shaman's atk buffs to add other's DPS, the worse slow, translating into more heals, translating into less druid DPS. Also while we're talking about fast killing, shamans also have FAST dots, now, so that argument simply won't fly that shamans are good DPS only during long fights.<br />
<br />
I look first for a BL...more hp's for me,<br />
By a whole 60HP, and that's ONLY if they can get all their buffs going at once. otherwise they're inferior. Let me tell you something, I YAWN at 60HP.<br />
<br />
 more attack for melee,<br />
Again, only situationally. You're mking like this i the way it is all the time, and that's just plain not the case.<br />
<br />
 more DPS, and more mana regen for casters, next a bard, who makes a group stronger in so many ways,<br />
And so can a shaman. And the shaman van make a group stronger in so many ways, and more at the same time.<br />
<br />
 then an enchanter(more DPS, free crack for the casters),<br />
more DPS? only situationally, and only with more risk. Again, you make it sound like this is ALL The time. Crack? can easily get it with any number of crack casters in nexus and PoK.<br />
<br />
 and lastly a shaman.  Note that with a chanter in group, it is usually very easy to trade KEI for shaman buffs, and not have an extra low DPS class ingroup.<br />
If you want to start talking about trading, you can trade for Fo7, Virtue, and any other buff you might name, but THOSE trading for buffs don't support your argument.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raivene</div><div class="date">01-26-2004, 06:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally I think the shamans can use a little bit of help for the 65 with AAs crowd.<br />
<br />
Myth  - Shamans are the best slowers in the game.<br />
<br />
Well...they have the highest percent slow.  They have a disease based slow that hits some mobs that nothing else will.  They have higher hps than enchanters and can heal themselves.   The reality, unfortunetly is that on normal (read non raid mobs) the chanters have some advantages that no on really talks about.  There might be other advantages to BL or bard that I dont' mention here, but I play a chanter as well as a warrior so I'm familiar with those advantages.<br />
<br />
1 - The chanters get spell casting subtlety.  This is huge.  I've seen it over and over and over again.  The chanter has the mob slowed 70% when the mob is at 95% health and doesn't get agro.  The shammy has to wait till the mob is at 85% and sometimes STILL gets summoned and beat on.  Now the chanter goes on to debuff with cripple or land a DoT, send his pet, nuke whatever and never pulls agro off the tank.  The shaman has to heal himself.  Simply put when you factor in the mana required to heal, when you can actually slow the mob without getting agro etc., the chanters seem to be more efficient.   Now this isn't totally a fair argument, since most enchanters have to cast Tash which is huge agro before they cast slow.  But there are pretty easy items in the game to get with effect Innoruuk's sarcasm that combined with subtelty make not getting agro trivial.  If you have a mage or shammy mala/malo it first the slow will land on normal mobs virtually everytime.<br />
<br />
2 - Chanters get Arcane rune and eldritch rune.  The part that folks who don't play chanters don't realize is you don't get pushed back while being hit with a rune on.  You can get bashed which will interrupt a spell sometimes, but normal hits chanters are immune from.  Simply put so long as the rune holds and you don't get bashed you will not be interrupted.  While the shammy is struggling to get that spell off, the enchanter is yawning, looking at his watch and recasting the spell.<br />
<br />
3 - Recast time.  If I recall correctly there is a recast time on shammy slow.  They have to sit there and wait till they can recast after a resist.  Enchanter gets resisted?  NBD...cast it again right away.<br />
<br />
bottom line to all this, Shammies are good.  They solo decently, provide great utility in the 1 to 64 game, have good haste, great slows, etc .  In the raid setting they are good to have, but having 2 shaman or 4 shaman on a raid doesnt' make a lot of difference.   Shammy buffs in the medium to high end raid situation mostly get clicked off.  Focus almost everyone keeps ... everyone usually has to leave *1* of the following up to max that one stat (boar, wrulon, diaku).  FA is great .. it would be even better if had a group version of the spell.   Mobs die too quickly to use DoTs on (excluding boss mobs), and even then you have druids, necros, shammies and sometimes even enchanters all trying to load the mob up with DoT spells when they can.  <br />
<br />
Shammies do need some help in one aspect of the game.  Stackability on raids.  Let them have a group heal that can be MGB'd.  That won't affect the group role.  Give them at least the same level nuke (1100) that chanters get, that also won't affect the group role where the shammy is the main healer too.  Maybe even buff their pet up just a bit.   <br />
<br />
The shaman community by and large supported the warrior community in it's recent efforts to address some long standing issues with our characters.  They have identified an issue with themselves and proposed several possible remedies for them.  Let's be nicer than a lot were to us.  Let's give them a bit of support in the section of the game it's needed in.</div></div><hr />

Uh, no he doesn't. Not since incite was added... I can slow at 99%.<br />
<br />
The shaman has to heal himself.<br />
MAYBE pre-incite... but since the addition of incite, that simply isn't the case any more.<br />
<br />
2 - Chanters get Arcane rune and eldritch rune.  <br />
Shamans are a chain class, with more hitpoints, who are also able to heal themselves. 6 of one, half a dozen of the other.<br />
<br />
3 - Recast time.  If I recall correctly there is a recast time on shammy slow.  They have to sit there and wait till they can recast after a resist.  Enchanter gets resisted?  NBD...cast it again right away.<br />
Yup, it's a 6 second recast time. not a real huge deal. Course, debuff before slow, and you don't normally need to worry about it.<br />
<br />
Mobs die too quickly to use DoTs on (excluding boss mobs), and even then you have druids, necros, shammies and sometimes even enchanters all trying to load the mob up with DoT spells when they can.<br />
Here, you DO have a point. that's why there's the 1K DD for 300 mana. It's like, maybe 10% worse than enchanter's, for the same ratio. That's not a real big issue, IMO.<br />
<br />
Let them have a group heal that can be MGB'd.  That won't affect the group role.<br />
That's not really needed. The paladins also want a Mass Group Heal. Good way to get the druids jealous and wanting more.... also it's a good way to encourage yet more big AE-centric encounters.<br />
<br />
Maybe even buff their pet up just a bit.<br />
This, I can agree on. Their pet isn't a wolf, it's a bit of a pussy. /cough =P<br />
<br />
Let's give them a bit of support in the section of the game it's needed in.<br />
For the most part, shaman upogrades aren't seen to be needed. It's one thing to give support for change that's needed, quite another to give support for change that's not. That's what's under question, not whether we'd support it if we felt it was needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">01-26-2004, 06:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't know what game you're playing but Shamans certainly don't need help.<br />
<br />
Even on a fast killing group there's always time to drop a Bane.  Even if the Shaman isn't doing any damage directly they can always FA the melees for a considerable boost.  Enchanter have no such option, unless you count the attack from Vallon's Quickening which can be obtained outside group fairly easily due to its long duration.  <br />
<br />
Quiscience is basically free and it's also a way better heal than Arcane Rune.  Also you can't compare a Shaman's mana regen to an Enchanter's.  Shamans really don't run out of mana, Enchanters do.<br />
<br />
They can even debuff the mob without getting aggroed (Malos vs Tash) if it's needed.  A bard is probably better than either, but I'd rather have a Shaman over an Enchanter for a lot of things.<br />
<br />
On the casting time issue, Forlorn is 6 cast/2.25 recast.  Turgur is 3 cast/6 recast.  If for some reason you need to slow multiple times, you'd probably need to drop a debuff and again Shaman wins since their debuff is virtually no aggro.  I guess if you didn't debuff the mob and tried to slow it 6 times or whatever the Enchanter would win (i.e. cast them faster) but that situation has got to be pretty rare.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Good point on the incite.  I don't think I've grouped with a shammy as prime slower in an XP group since it came out.<br />
<br />
My point on the rune and recast though is to address the shammy tanking portion brought up earlier.  On those occasions where the slow is resisted, the shammy is going to be able to take real hits better than the enchanter.  The enchanter though will normally still get the mob slowed and mezed well before the shammy can.  Again, as you said, six of one.<br />
<br />
The shammy pet does need some...ummm... adjustments.   He's not a lot better, in all honesty, than the chanter pet.  Same max hit of 60 I think, about the same godawful hps and at least the chanter pet dual wields out of the box.<br />
<br />
On the nukes, the absolute worst nuking pure class has traditionally been the enchanters.  That was ok as part of the balance.  To have shammies below the generally accepted low nukes seems a bit strange.  DoTs may not stack...but nukes always do.  Now the chanter nukes have a relatively long recast time (6 secs as I recall) so if the shammy nuke casts faster than this is a moot point.<br />
<br />
I can agree the pallies want a group heal etc..., but for purposes of this conversation I'm far more concerned with the parity of cleric/druid/shaman.  The hybrids have to balanced with a far more intricate equation than the 3 non hybrid healing classes.  To me, the shaman can use a bit of a bone here.<br />
<br />
For my own xp groups I usually have 2 slots open as I 4 box most times.  I don't take any one class over any other for those spots, but from the perspective of DPS done , DPS received etc., shammy is not my favorite in those positions.  Beastlord would be.  They are just that good.   I can very well see the shammy sitting out on the sidelines 6 months from know the way things are progressing.  Pushing SoE to be proactive rather than reactive to what's needed I think is worth the effort alone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 Because you can't depend on having a mob there to DC every place you go. You can only depend on what's in the spellbook. Furthermore, while Enchanter nukes &gt; Shaman nukes, do you REALLY want to argue that Enchanter nukes + dots + pet &gt; Shaman nukes + dots + pet? :p <br />

 How can you claim SHM have better DPS than Druids, then turn around and list Druids has having better nukes... Did you know that Druid dots have neg resist checks against them (making them easier to land) where as the Shaman dots don't? <br />

 BL Healing. If the BST is pet healing they far out heal a Shaman. As they have direct pet heals for 1200pts. And if the BST is going to be healing they sure as hell are going to be healing their pets... <br />
<br />
 And BL's who have to heal other members of their party can do 428 HP's for 175 mana. Shamans, I'll admit, are less effective at healing BL pets, but in every other situation blow away BL's at healing, hands down. Of course, you can throw in the AA for Paragon, and I'll be sure to add the AA's for heals to the massively larger player targeted Shaman heals. :D <br />
<br />

 You're actually right, and Shamans ARE king of the heap here, too, but we have to give Druids the illusion that they're better at something besides Forage, also. Otherwise we'll see a 'well thought out' petiton on the Sony boards for them again. :mad:</div></div><hr />

Enchanters out DPS *any* class in the game with a charmed, hasted pet. Not a Dire Charm pet, a Command of Druzzil charmed pet. <br />

<br />
Charm has gone through several re-tunings over the past year or so, so as to balance the risk vs the reward... now, while the reward is still great in having very nice DPS, the risk of having the chanter being killed by a pet who broke charm at exactly the wrong time, is also a high risk. Even with the VT/EP geared folk.<br />

Now, dire charmed pets, on the other hand, are a dime a dozen. Especially in EP.</div></div><hr />

 People keep having to concede points, have to admit that they're playing Paladin argument games, and yet say that the OTHER GUY is the one with no clue.<br />
<br />
 And as far as the 'Non 65' epenis bullshit, why don't you tell Redhenna to shut up on Shaman issues? Red's only 56 and any evidence brought from a 56 Shaman regarding 65+AA would be as anecdotal as anything I bring, according to you.<br />

I really don't understand why people always say we are balanced.<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Well, because we don't really specialize in one particular thing, but we are capable of filling many roles in a group, and we've been able to do this since before Kunark, as well as being able to solo if we don't wish to group, and we can fit into any size group whether it's a duo or a 6 person group.<br />

Staying the same for 3 years does not equal balanced when other priests/casters have gained so much.<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Actually, staying the same for 3 years is the epitome of being balanced. If we weren't balanced, we'd have had changes done to our class TO MAKE us balanced. Instead, we remain unchanged because we have been and are still balanced compared to other classes out there.<br />

What are our 2 best spells other than our level 51 spell from kunark (3 yrs ago)<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Class balance isn't based around 1 or 2 spells. It's why clerics weren't balanced when they were only good for Aego and Cheal back in the days of Kunark. Class balance is based around everything the class can do. Shaman class balance is based around the combination of all these abilities, but not limited to:<br />
Heals<br />
Slows<br />
Resist debuffs<br />
Pet<br />
Nukes<br />
Dots<br />
Root<br />
Buffs<br />
Miscellaneous Spells (like Invis, Bind Vision, Ultravision)<br />
Armor type<br />
AA abilities<br />
Of all the abilities in the game, ressing, fearing, snaring, porting, and mezzing are the only main abilities that we cannot cast inherantly. Fear is fairly useless at high end game. It's possible to get multiple items that will allow you to snare if it's of absolute necessity. Porting is fairly inconsequential with Graveyards and PoK stones. And mezzing while very nice to have can be substituted by parking mobs with root by any competant shaman. When a class can do just about everything reasonably well, that's balance.<br />

Now with Tier 2 and 3+ zones we still can't be main healer without pulling our hair out and constant cannibalizing (pain in the arse), but clerics and druids both make fine healers. <br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
If you don't like wincing, don't play a shaman.<br />
And shaman can heal just fine in any tier of zone. The only places they can't heal ok is if you are hunting in the Elemental planes on the mobs that hit for 900+. I can heal just fine on mobs that are only partially slowable that hit for 700s. Quiescence and fast heals or Q and 2k heals work just fine healing a real tank in PoFire at the 1st castle. Clerics in groups are pretty much dedicated only to healing players when the group is rapidly pulling mobs with no downtime. A shaman solely concentrating on healing can function as the healer in a group.<br />
Quote:<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
This is all because of one spell, turgurs. A spell that is only marginally better than what a chanter and BL can use. And when you take into account the amount of DPS a BL offers with his pet/melee and a chanter with his charms and ownage in the CC dept. most people will agree that the dps/usefullness each class brings to the table outweighs the 5% loss of their slows... even more so with the amount of mitigating mobs out there.<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
I have yet to see a group ask for a BST to be the main slower and healer in a group. If the BST is doing the slowing job on multiple mob pulls, he's not meleeing. He's medding to get back the mana he's spending because he doesn't have canni. The only damage he's contributing is through his pet. Meanwhile, a shaman can slow all the mobs in camp, as well as heal or cast spells or do other things that a BST couldn't possibly do because they don't have the mana regeneration. It's called balance. BST can slow and melee if you have solo pulls. Shaman can slow and dot if you have solo pulls. BST can slow and med if you have multiple pulls. Shaman can slow and dot if you have multiple pulls. Once class is a bit better in one situation, while another class is better in another. That's balance my friend.<br />
Quote:<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Basically if I wasn't a shaman and I was gonna form a group I would most definitely take a BL or chanter over a shaman in most PoP zones for their huge advantage of dps over a shaman. But we're balanced..... (not really)<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Oh boo hoo. I have a monk alt that I've played here and there up to level 58 so far. When I want a group somewhere, I look for a shaman first. The reason I want a shaman first is because I'm a shaman myself and I know how incredibly versatile the shaman is. The BST might do some more damage if they concentrate on a single mob, but that's just it. They have to concentrate on single targets to excel. The moment you get something like a 3 pull, a BST can't handle it as the support class. Root is a huge tool we have. 2 Well placed roots are worth an entire BST and his pet in terms of mana spent healing.<br />
<br />
I have no competition from BST finding groups. I have no competition from Enc finding groups. I am the base of my groups a lot of the time and build my group around whatever classes are available. If I get a healer in my group, I won't look for chanter because it's not necessary a lot of the time. I'll look for DPS at that point. If I grab a chanter, I'll skip on the healer quite possibly since I'll take over that role. If I see all DPS classes, I'll take them all and just play debuffer and slower in the group. I can do this precisely because the Shaman is balanced. We aren't going to heal as well as a cleric or druid. We aren't going to nuke like the nuking classes. We aren't going to CC like Enchanters do. We aren't going to dot like necros do. We aren't going to do anything better than anyone else except slow a bit more. But what no one else can do is do EVERYTHING at once in a group. Shaman can slow and heal and add some dps and CC in a group all at once.<br />
<br />
Shaman are the class by which other classes are measured in terms of how balanced THEY are. We are not to be measured against other single classes to see how balanced we are in relation to one other class and the aspect in which they excel.<br />
<br />
Well, if you are kind of wondering...<br />
I've got LR5, ID1, SCRM so far as related AAs.<br />
I've got about 9 pieces of VT gear, ele plane arms, and an ele plane mask.<br />
I've got FT12.<br />
I've got malosini neck from VT, and pretty much every focus effect I'll ever need.<br />
<br />
There's a friend of mine that has a 56 Shadowknight. I helped her get PoV flagged at 47. We've been duoing in PoV ever since then. We started out on Larvae, but moved on to Golems. I main tank everything because she can't get aggro off my quite yet if I use both my poison dots. I don't have to even keep my heal memmed. As long as I don't go too low for safety, Quiescence is easily enough healing to keep myself healthy when a golem/spider is trying to kill me. I pull with free malosini, slow, then double poison dot them, and keep up my dots the whole fight, and usually end the fight at about 80+ mana.<br />
<br />
When I go to PoFire, there's these level 65 humanoid mobs in the first castle that look like the mobs in Sol Ro tower. They are partially slowable, and hit for about 700. I can party with a warrior and he'll need Q and sometimes 2k heal to stay healthy if I'm duoing. If I'm partying with a Knight, I'll probably be able to get away with just Q.<br />
<br />
With LR5 and Q, I can main tank pretty much anything that's mostly or fully slowable and hits for 700 or less. Slow + poison dot holds aggro very well. I can solo kill by tanking down Sol Ro mobs with difficulty, but it's doable. The only thing I can't really handle tanking is the stuff that starts to hit for 900s in PoFire, the stuff that rampages like mobs in PoEarth, or multiple mobs at once. Give me a healer in a group, and I can tank about 90% of the xp mobs in all of PoP.<br />
Pre Kunark the shaman was a healer as good as druids but much worse than clerics, that debuffed about as well as enchanters, could dot as well as necros, and nuked nearly as well as druids.<br />
<br />
During Kunark, the shaman was as good a healer as druids but lost ground to clerics increased heal abilities, could debuff even better with addition of Malo, could dot about as well as necros, and lost ground on nukes.<br />
<br />
During Velious, druids got a wee bit better at healing, debuffing didn't change, dotting didn't change, and nuking didn't change.<br />
<br />
During Luclin with AAs nothing much really changed except that shaman sort of advanced in everything indirectly due to C5 and our massive mana regen. It indirectly made all our other spellcasting abilities better because we don't have to worry about their mana costs as much, so for example while we can't nuke as well, we can throw more nukes without going oom so it sort of catches us up.<br />
<br />
During POP, we lose ground to the cheal type healing spells, but still stay competitive with Quiesence, get even more debuffing power with malos and malosinia and Cloud of Grummus, can't dot as well as a necro but still keep a close second, and lost more ground on nukes.<br />
<br />
If you look at the course of things, we haven't changed much. We have always been close to druids in healing abilities, but pulled ahead of us because they don't have as many other things to give a group as we do. We have always been very close to necros in terms of dotting things, and still are. We've always been close to enchanters in terms of debuffing, but have pulled ahead with our unresistable dr debuff, dslows, and our Malo(s). We've been close to druids in terms of DDs, but fell behind because we use our dots for damage over DDs and they needed something to make them more desirable to groups. Throughout time we've been in the same spot as we are now in terms of heals, dots, debuffs, and nukes. We've just gained ground in some areas and lost it in areas that we don't do as much, just on occasion.<br />

<br />
 Likewise, I could go to EVERY class board in EQ and find someone griping that their class is unbalanced, I could find someone griping that another class is too overpowered (And using suspect data to 'prove' it), and I could find someone claiming that Sony ignores their class and they never get groups as long as class XYZ 'brings more to the table'. And for 10 of the 15 class boards you'd do that at, you'd LOL at them and then laugh harder when they say things like 'You're just trivializing the problems we have 'cause you dont' know anything about them!!1!!'<br />

Another difficulty the shaman are facing is that we are suffering deficiencies in so many areas, that it looks like we’re asking for the world if we suggest fixes for them! However, in terms of balance, fixing one or two of the issues would effectively negate four or five others. For instance, addressing damage per second (“dps”) covers nukes, damage over time spells (“DoTs”) and pets concurrently. A fix in one of those areas might make changes in the others overpowering. Accordingly, we decided to post a list of problems we feel need to be addressed desperately. After all, you folks at SoE have to decide what constitutes balance in the end.</div></div><hr />

Druids got a nice upgrade in their heals, while Shaman got shit. I think shaman have a legitimate concern about their heals not being powerful enough. Why shouldn't shaman have a 2350-ish heal?

Actaully, I rarely debuff unless I am having a real trouble with resists, or am raiding, with my mage.  If I do, I use a lower level mal* spell, which gives me all the debuff I usually need.<br />

Sta does nothing for pets.  You can check that py having some one cast sta on you and your pet.  When cast on you, your max hp's rises, but not current, so your health will be at less that 100 %.  Cast it on your pet and their health stays at 100 %.  Makes absolutly no difference as far as your point, just thought I would mention it tho.<br />

Ick, you linked to casters realm(the satan of EQ sites, it was them told me I would be better of being an agnostic warrior and put my starting points in str oh so long ago).  You also linked to an ancient spell,  Woohoo, so many shaman have that.  There is an inherent problem with DoTing as a shaman in an exp group.  Similar to nukes, it takes multiple DoTs to get much in the way of DPS, so let's look at an example to show the problem.  Tank engages mob, it's got roughly let's say 1 minute to live.  First you cast Malos(400 mana), which takes 5 seconds, then 2.5 seconds for spell gem to reset.  Next up us Turgurs(250 mana), 3 second cast time, 2.5 more seconds for spell gem to reset.  47 seconds left till mob is dead, or just under 8 ticks.  You can cast Blood of Saryn now(535 mana), 5.7 second cast.  It should land with 7 ticks remaining, assuming you chained the spells one on top of the other, so it will run its course.  The shaman now has 38 DPS going for the course of the fight, and has used 1185 mana.  Next up after that 2.5 seconds reset, we go with Bane(490 mana), 5.5 second cast, it's not quite going to run it's duration of 5 ticks, but will for sake of easy math give it full damage wich will increase shaman DPS for the course of the fight by 35, for 73 total.  The shaman has used 1675 mana total to do this, and has 30 seconds to regain that mana.  Note canni 4 returns 82 mana every 5 seconds, so 6 canni's for 492 mana returned from canni.  On those pulls when canni5 is up, that returns 1066 mana, making mana use about even for that pull.  A shaman can do this every 3 minutes(or 3 pulls for this example.  So, this should show that a shaman using their 2 best DoTs that you point out does a glorious 73 DPS, and rapidly runs 00m.  Yes, focus affects will change these numbers, and it is not as  dire as it sounds at first, but even using their 2 best DoTs, a shaman will still have a paltry DPS, and use mana in a rapid manor.  In LDoN, where the average mob lasts 30 seconds, and DPS is even more important, shaman DPS drops significantly.  One last point to add is that based on Lucy, the new DoT that shaman get this expansion is a disease DoT that lasts 2.1 minutes, and that I have seen no shaman say they want.<br />
<br />
Which one heals you? I mean, if you're going into groups preset with a healer and a slower and want as high a DPS as you could ever want, then yeah, you're not looking for a Shaman right away. However, I submit that most groups do NOT exclude Shamans when looking for a slower, not do they NOT exclude Shamans when looking for a healer. <br />
<br />
Well, if I am playing my mage, I am not going to get hit(and trust me, I am good at not getting hit).  If I do get hit, I am probably dead unless some one pulls the mob off very very fast.  Mages are the only int caster without some form of self rune.  I have never actually seen a group look for a shaman as primary healer in outside LDoN since I have been 65.  It can be done, tho it has some innate risks(the slow bounce, tnarg chain to keep tank up cycle).  Druids and clerics are much prefered, simply because the larger amounts they can heal makes for a safer situation.<br />
<br />
I wholly agree, in fact today the only healers.....59 Shaman and 59 Paladin, did fine in an LDoN adventure, and thats all that matters to me! <br />
<br />
Shaman complaints are based around the post 65 game.    I can state for a fact that during the 50's, shaman are very powerfull(tho LDoN has redued shaman desirability some even there).<br />
<br />
Shamans shouldn't have heals anywhere close to a Druid or a Cleric because they have way more mana. Cannibalize + AA Cannibalize is just so much mana that you can afford to toss out close to twice the heals any other class can afford with the same base stats, not to mention Quiscence has an insanely good mana to HP healed ratio when you have focus/AAs, and isn't even that bad without any focus/AAs at all. <br />
<br />
This is somewhat misleading.  Mana costs(and most shaman spells are very innefficient in terms of mana cost) are not the issue, size is.  Quiescence is 300 hp's a tick, or to put it another way, can cover 50 DPS.  Tnargs is 1300 hp's.  A shaman has no way to react to damage spikes other than to chain Tnarg's.  This is fine while everything is going well, but as soon as something does go wrong, they have no way to recover.  If you look at the suggestions for healing improvements that they listed, none of them would be overpowering</div></div><hr />

Yes once a while you can't slow so there's some spikes but you overlook that a druid or a cleric cannot slow at all and their spikes is going to be a lot worse than your spikes because they can't even slow.<br />
<br />
Clerics cast Supernal Elixir all the time and it's only 500/tick, and they certainly can't use it as liberally as Shamans can with Quiscence.  Yes if someone's getting pounded on by an unslowed mob and you cast a Quiscence it's probably not going to do the trick but that's not what the spell is for.  Slow is your ability to deal with spike damages.  Of course if a druid or a cleric has a slower they have to be better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">01-28-2004, 02:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">All true.  The trouble is that slow does get resisted, even after malos.  When that happens, shaman as primary healer quickly becomes troublesome.  Note also that slow is most likely to be resisted by tougher mobs, krigers in BoT as an example most of us can relate to.  Acting as primary healer to a mob that hits for high 600's or 700's(some one help me here, what do krigers hit for...I am drawing a blank...seems like over 600 anyway), all it takes is one slow resist and a shaman is in dire trouble.  A group is much safer with a cleric/druid healer, and a slower(and as I have argued before, a shaman brings less than the other slowers to a group...especially if you are not a melee...ask a wizzy for example which slow class they would prefer).<br />
<br />
I do want to add fast that arguing for a class to get upgrades on a message board for a class that has more pressing issues is bound to be a painfull process.  I do not feel that shaman are in terrible shape, only that they have some legitimate concerns.  They are competing for group slots agains one of the most overpowered classes in EQ(BL's), and 2 very powerfull classes(bards and chanters).  The upgrades they are asking for are not huge(a small increase to healing ability, or small upgrades to canni, or either reducing cast time on their top nuke, or a nuke with similar time and ratio, but a little more damage,  or tweaking shaman slows, or changes to buffs, such as group FA, entirely new buffs...think a shielding mob buff, endurence buff, buffs that exceed the stat cap like bard songs exceed the haste cap(note that I think some of those would help melee alot too)), and they are not asking for all of them.  Yes, warriors, monks, mages at least all need alot more help than shaman, but that alone does not mean that shaman do not have legitimate issues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daemonwynd</div><div class="date">01-28-2004, 02:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You also linked to an ancient spell,  Woohoo, so many shaman have that.<br />
I know lots that do... so would you have me believe that it doesn't matter, because it's a rarer spell? Especially when you yourself were specifically limiting it to the 65 +AA's crowd? Please. You'll have to do better than that. <br />
<br />
There is an inherent problem with DoTing as a shaman in an exp group.  Similar to nukes, it takes multiple DoTs to get much in the way of DPS, so let's look at an example to show the problem.<br />
&lt;cough&gt; and it takes multiple swings for melee to get much in the way of DPS. It takes multiples of ANYTHING to get much in the way of DPS, that's just how the game works.<br />
<br />
Tank engages mob, it's got roughly let's say 1 minute to live.  First you cast Malos(400 mana), which takes 5 seconds, then 2.5 seconds for spell gem to reset.  Next up us Turgurs(250 mana), 3 second cast time, 2.5 more seconds for spell gem to reset.  47 seconds left till mob is dead, or just under 8 ticks.  You can cast Blood of Saryn now(535 mana), 5.7 second cast.  It should land with 7 ticks remaining, assuming you chained the spells one on top of the other, so it will run its course.  The shaman now has 38 DPS going for the course of the fight, and has used 1185 mana.<br />
And you're complaining to ME about being misleading. What I don't see you mentioning here, is that he's got the mob debuffed, he's also got the mob slowed, AND he's doing DPS for that mana.<br />
<br />
Next up after that 2.5 seconds reset, we go with Bane(490 mana), 5.5 second cast, it's not quite going to run it's duration of 5 ticks, but will for sake of easy math give it full damage wich will increase shaman DPS for the course of the fight by 35, for 73 total.  The shaman has used 1675 mana total to do this, and has 30 seconds to regain that mana.<br />
Don't be ridiculous... First you're starting off with as soon as the mob hits camp, it lasts a minute, now all of a sudden you're saying he's got 30 seconds to regain all that mana? Please. And talk about misleading... you're claiming the shaman has got DPS of 73, and used 1675 mana to do so? There you go being misleading again... The shaman hasn't used 1675 mana just to get that DPS, the shaman's used that mana to debuff, AND slow, AND double DoT the creature. Plus, you're also forgetting pet DPS, pitiful as it is.<br />
<br />
Note canni 4 returns 82 mana every 5 seconds, so 6 canni's for 492 mana returned from canni.  On those pulls when canni5 is up, that returns 1066 mana, making mana use about even for that pull.  A shaman can do this every 3 minutes(or 3 pulls for this example.  So, this should show that a shaman using their 2 best DoTs that you point out does a glorious 73 DPS, and rapidly runs 00m.<br />
Uh huh, and of course, I don't see you adding in mana regen from FT, OR from c5, or any of the host of mana regen spells, abilities, or AA's. Of course not.<br />
<br />
Yes, focus affects will change these numbers, and it is not as  dire as it sounds at first, but even using their 2 best DoTs, a shaman will still have a paltry DPS, and use mana in a rapid manor..<br />
Let me clue you into something here, those aren't bad numbers, biased and wrong as they are, with your ignoring external mana regen other than cann, lack of addition of focus effect, lack of pets, and so on,  because, guess what, SHAMMIES AREN'T a DPS CLASS! They add DECENT damage, AS WELL as being a debuffing, healing, slowing, hasting, buffing class, and you know what, they do ALL of those, &quot;well enough&quot;. Considering they do ALL of that, those are pretty respectable numbers!<br />
<br />
One last point to add is that based on Lucy, the new DoT that shaman get this expansion is a disease DoT that lasts 2.1 minutes, and that I have seen no shaman say they want.<br />
<br />
That's not surprising, I have yet to see any class say they want any of their new spells. Why? because they all pretty much SUCK.<br />
<br />
All true. The trouble is that slow does get resisted, even after malos.<br />
Rarely. VERY rarely. And ya know what, you know those bards and beastlords that you were saying did these things &quot;good enough?&quot; Yeah, they're gonna have MORE of a problem with resists than the shaman, who as we see you're complaining about slow being resisted as part of an argument to show how shamans are so bad.<br />
<br />
A group is much safer with a cleric/druid healer, and a slower<br />
Yeah, but you know what, you know that ability that you keep touting as being so good, the ability to do things &quot;good enough&quot;, even if they aren't the best at it? Shamans are &quot;good enough&quot; at being slower AND healer at the same time, most especially in trivial content, and they are the ONLY class in the game that can fill both roles at once.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It drops in what...2 zones?  The link you provided shows it droping from RoV...ya, that's done alot these days.<br />
<br />
First you're starting off with as soon as the mob hits camp, it lasts a minute, now all of a sudden you're saying he's got 30 seconds to regain all that mana? <br />
<br />
Ok, to actively regain that mana...you are correct, that is clearer.  I thought it would be understood, but I was wrong on that.<br />
<br />
And talk about misleading... you're claiming the shaman has got DPS of 73, and used 1675 mana to do so?There you go being misleading again... The shaman hasn't used 1675 mana just to get that DPS, the shaman's used that mana to debuff, AND slow, AND double DoT the creature. <br />
<br />
Noooo, I said that during the course of the fight, the shaman used that much mana, even listing mana costs with each spell...reading comprehension is gud.<br />
<br />
Plus, you're also forgetting pet DPS, pitiful as it is. <br />
<br />
True, I did forget pet damage, but as you point out, it is pitiful.<br />
<br />
Uh huh, and of course, I don't see you adding in mana regen from FT, OR from c5, or any of the host of mana regen spells, abilities, or AA's. Of course not. <br />
<br />
Ok, let's include those.  Let's assume KEI(since shaman is slower, I am assuming no chanter in group and shaman bought a C3), FT7, standing regen of 3(no sitting regen now, our example shaman is chain casting), that is 24 mana per tick, or 240 mana over the course of the fight.  Add in 492 from the 6 cannis, that is 732 mana.  Wait, I forgot MC3(prereq to canni5), that is another 3 mana a tick, takes the total to 762 mana in, 1675 mana out.  Let's be really nice and add PoT9 and SD for another 17 per tick, 170 mana.  we are up to 1002 mana in over that minute.  Only 672 net loss.  Let's add a MP4 item and assume the shaman has scm3, this reduces mana cost on the spells cast by ~235...only 438 mana down now.  With Canni 5 every third pull you get 1066 mana(minus 200 mana for the Q cast to heal the damage taken).  That nets 866/3 =287 per pull.  So, under better than average circumstances, a shaman can do sub 100 DPS, slow and debuff, and only looses ~150 mana per mob.  With a chanter in group to C5, situation is better, but why then have a shaman in group?  Happy now with the numbers?<br />
<br />
<br />
They add DECENT damage, AS WELL as being a debuffing, healing, slowing, hasting, buffing class, and you know what, they do ALL of those, &quot;well enough&quot;. Considering they do ALL of that, those are pretty respectable numbers! <br />
<br />
You brought up their fantastic DoTs, I simply showed you why they are less than awesome.   Before the big melee revamp, I used to point out that in a vaccum, warriors where perfectly viable.  Groups could use us and succeed.  We were 'well enough'.  But when compared to knights, all of a sudden,well enough was not enough.  This is similar to shaman problems.  Looked at in a vaccum, they look good, but when compared against those who they compete with for group slots, they start to not look so good. <br />
<br />
That's not surprising, I have yet to see any class say they want any of their new spells. Why? because they all pretty much SUCK <br />
<br />
But every class get's some upgrade in power out of their new spells(usually 10 %...10 % more damamge for 10 % more mana), and shaman get...a disease DoT that looks to be useless, and a less effective slow, but has a resist adjust of -40.  Shaman AA's are equally bad(looking at warrior AA's, I am actually looking forward to 2 of them).<br />
<br />
Edit:  Damn you for editing while I was posting...now I got to redo some of this...oh well.<br />
<br />
And ya know what, you know those bards and beastlords that you were saying did these things &quot;good enough?&quot;  <br />
<br />
But guess what, those clerics and druids healing during this are more than capable of keeping up.  You say that shaman slow gets resisted rarely, and this is true, but BL slows don't get resisted all that often, not bard slows.  More than a shaman...yes, but not to the point where it slows down killing.<br />
<br />
Shamans are &quot;good enough&quot; at being slower AND healer at the same time, most especially in trivial content, and they are the ONLY class in the game that can fill both roles at once. <br />
<br />
You are right, they are the only ones who can.  Trouble is, it is very very rare to have a group that wants a shaman to do both.  It is also rare that a shaman gets an invite as primary healer, period.  About as often as a warrior gets an invite as DPS...we don't generally get group spots as DPS, shaman don't as primary healer.  It does happen, but it is not a big selling point of the class.</div></div><hr />

If I do get hit, I am probably dead unless some one pulls the mob off very very fast. Mages are the only int caster without some form of self rune. I have never actually seen a group look for a shaman as primary healer in outside LDoN since I have been 65. It can be done, tho it has some innate risks(the slow bounce, tnarg chain to keep tank up cycle). Druids and clerics are much prefered, simply because the larger amounts they can heal makes for a safer situation. <br />
<br />
 And of course, that's why Shamans are much prefered for slow, simply because the larger amount they can slow makes for a safer situation as well. :D <br />
<br />
 At any rate, where are you fighting with a  56, unflagged Shaman that is so very instantaneously deadly, especially if you're cracking 3k with buffs? Are you playing solely in Tier 2?</div></div><hr />

I comprehended just fine. Sure, you can claim what you really meant, but thing is, you APPEAR to be claiming like &quot;well, the shaman's doing this much DPS, and he used this ungodly amount of mana to do so.&quot;<br />
<br />
 True, I did forget pet damage, but as you point out, it is pitiful.<br />
But nothing, it still makes a difference.<br />
 <br />
<br />

Which is an assumption of which is not always the case, but I'll let that pass.<br />
<br />
With a chanter in group to C5, situation is better, but why then have a shaman in group?  Happy now with the numbers?<br />
<br />
A little happier. Note first of all that you're completely ignoring horsemed @25/tick, which screws your numbers right up. Let me also point out that in not every group and most definitely not all the time are you going to be constantly fighting one mob after another with no break time. Many times, these 65+ AA shamans will have better than the basic mana pres as well. Not only THAT, but they're damn lucky to get that, no other class in the game can debuff AND slow AND buff AND do DPS and have a hope in hell of pulling it off at all well... hell, noone of them can pull *all* of that off at ALL! Your oh-so-powerful bards and beastlords would be sittin there going... you want me to do WHAT? Yeah right. The beastlord would be permanently parked on his ass, with only the pet doing the DPS. Yet you're whining about how they're weak for it. Sheesh.<br />
<br />
As for why have a shaman in a group with a chanter... because the shaman can also play healer and buffer? Come on, Redhenna. Don't try and tell me you honestly don't know why a shaman would be in a group with a chanter....<br />
<br />
 You brought up their fantastic DoTs, I simply showed you why they are less than awesome.<br />
<br />
Less than awesome... they're only MARGINALLY worse than the best dotter in the game! And the best dotter in the game doesn't have HALF the other abilities you do! Cry me a river, they're &quot;less than awesome.&quot; Especially considering all your OTHER abilities too.<br />
<br />
Looked at in a vaccum, they look good, but when compared against those who they compete with for group slots, they start to not look so good.<br />
<br />
Wrong. It's the &quot;grass is greener on the other side of the fence&quot; syndrome. Shamans are just fine, as many people in this thread agree with me. They were, are, and remain extremely flexible and capable characters.<br />
<br />
But guess what, those clerics and druids healing during this are more than capable of keeping up.  You say that shaman slow gets resisted rarely, and this is true, but BL slows don't get resisted all that often, not bard slows. More than a shaman...yes, but not to the point where it slows down killing.<br />
<br />
Oh, come on. First you complain about SHAMAN slows being resisted and claiming how it can cause all sorts of problems, then you blow off beastlord slows, a class that can't even debuff before slows, as not being resisted all that often, and not causing much of a problem? That's a lot of crap. I hear beastlords bitching all the time about their damn slow not sticking. And I know if I don't debuff before slow, my slow bounces an annoying amount of the time. So if it's annoying for me, it's for damn sure annoying for them.<br />
No, shamans don't need to worry about slow bouncing all that much with their debuffs, so there's not even nearly the problem that you would like to make it out to be. It's about as much for a problem for a shaman as healer and slower, as it is for a cleric or a druid with a beastlord or bard slower.<br />
<br />
 You are right, they are the only ones who can.  Trouble is, it is very very rare to have a group that wants a shaman to do both.<br />
<br />
Yeah, you're right. That's why the versatile shaman usually only does one of them, and assumes another role. That's why they're so good. They're not like a chanter and stuck in the CC/slower/haster role, for example.<br />
<br />
It does happen, but it is not a big selling point of the class. <br />
<br />
Yeah, it's a good thing you do so many OTHER things too. Like slow. haste. debuff. DoT. A good shaman takes a look at the group he's in and assumes any one of several different roles, more than any other class is capable of. All of which, I might add, he can do ably, or &quot;good enough.&quot;Slower not to good? I'll take that. Melee need some buffs? Here ya go. Healer getting LoM or need a hand? toss off some heals. Toss off a few DoTs. Root some adds of, or sic a quiess'd pet on em for a few seconds. toss a few debuffs for the casters to get their spells to land better. <br />
<br />
But, ya know... I hear on one hand, that bards and beastlords, for example, get groups for their slows, because their slow abilities  &quot;good enough&quot;, even if they are not the greatest at them... plus they can &quot;add so much more&quot; in other ways.<br />
<br />
Yet, I mention all these things that shamans can do that they do &quot;good enough&quot;, even if they are not the greatest at them... plus they add so much more in other ways, yet all of a sudden for you &quot;good enough&quot; isn't good enough! All of a sudden, shamans, this class that you're interested in proving are underpowered, don't get groups for THEIR ability to heal, which is &quot;good enough&quot; like a beastlord's ability to slow is &quot;good enough&quot;!<br />
<br />
It really appears to me that you're only using these good enouarguments as they help your argument, and as soon as it helps your claim to say the opposite, you'll jump right over to the opposite site and start claiming THAT.</div></div><hr />

This is utter BS... I have group with tons of 65 BL's and they never had a problem with mana... And hell they would 90% of the time &quot;preslow&quot; a mob before the shaman could get malos or every start to slow... This last statement is just flat out WRONG.

<br />
Yes, it does drop in VT, and on my server, that is done by a total of 2 guilds right now.  Not a spell 90+ % of shaman have or will ever have.<br />
<br />
I comprehended just fine. Sure, you can claim what you really meant, but thing is, you APPEAR to be claiming like &quot;well, the shaman's doing this much DPS, and he used this ungodly amount of mana to do so.&quot; <br />
<br />
If you comprehend so well, then you can explain how listing mana cost for each spell, and then listing the total mana cost is in any way misleading.  If you could not follow that chain, you have serious problems with simple reading comprehension.  I apear  to be doing nothing but exactly what I ws doing, listing spell mana costs, and keeping a running total.<br />
<br />
Note first of all that you're completely ignoring horsemed @25/tick, which screws your numbers right up <br />
<br />
Only in outdoor zones.  Yes, there are zones other then BoT in this game.<br />
<br />
Let me also point out that in not every group and most definitely not all the time are you going to be constantly fighting one mob after another with no break time <br />
<br />
Then it is time to find a different group.  Downtime is the devil.<br />
<br />
 Many times, these 65+ AA shamans will have better than the basic mana pres as well. <br />
<br />
And many times they will not have all the buffs I listed.  I tried to make a nice list of buffs + focus effects + AA that would yield something like a semi meaningfull number.  Truth is, whether you like to admit it or not, that a shaman is mana limited(as well as time limited) on what they can do.  That was the whole point of the numbers.<br />
<br />
Not only THAT, but they're damn lucky to get that, no other class in the game can debuff AND slow AND buff AND do DPS and have a hope in hell of pulling it off at all well... hell, noone of them can pull *all* of that off at ALL! <br />
<br />
Enchanters.  Can debuff with tash and cripple, can slow, can buff KEI line, haste, NDT, DPS with COD/DC pet, plus nukes, and they can do it very well.  Don't you just hate making a strong comment like that, and have it turn out to be entirely wrong?<br />
<br />
Your oh-so-powerful bards and beastlords would be sittin there going... you want me to do WHAT? Yeah right. The beastlord would be permanently parked on his ass, with only the pet doing the DPS. Yet you're whining about how they're weak for it. Sheesh. <br />
<br />
And yet I frequently group with BL's and bards who can do it.  I notice you forgot to mention chanters again...they are so inconvienient to your argument.<br />
<br />
Less than awesome... they're only MARGINALLY worse than the best dotter in the game! <br />
<br />
True soloing, tho necros can do have a real edge.  Grouped tho it is another issue.  While the necro can lay on his DoTs from the start, allowing them to stack more DoTs, the shaman has to debuff and slow first, and only then can DoT, limiting the number of DoTs they can stack.  Also, a necro can FD off agro from those DoTs, while a shaman by thetime they have slowed and double DoTed is probably taking a couple hits.<br />
<br />
As for why have a shaman in a group with a chanter... because the shaman can also play healer and buffer? Come on, Redhenna. Don't try and tell me you honestly don't know why a shaman would be in a group with a chanter.... <br />
<br />
The only reason I can see to have a shaman in a group when I already have a chanter would be that I simply cannot find a cleric or druid to heal, and that is rare.  Note that I already mentioned how a shaman getting a primary healing group slot is about like a warrior getting a DPS group slot.  Otherwise, if I have a chanter, and a healer, the shaman is just taking up space that could be better used by a DPS class.<br />
<br />
Wrong. It's the &quot;grass is greener on the other side of the fence&quot; syndrome. Shamans are just fine, as many people in this thread agree with me. They were, are, and remain extremely flexible and capable characters. <br />
<br />
And I disagree with this statement.  Since it is a matter of opinion, we can at best simply disagree.  You have offered no real good reason that shamana are fine, only that they can do lots of things.  I counter that other classes can also do lots of things, and do them better.<br />
<br />
Oh, come on. First you complain about SHAMAN slows being resisted and claiming how it can cause all sorts of problems, then you blow off beastlord slows, a class that can't even debuff before slows, as not being resisted all that often, and not causing much of a problem? <br />
<br />
Ah, let's take statements out of context and try that ploy why don't we?  You are getting desperate.  I stated that when a shaman is both slower and  healer, that a resisted slow can cause significant problems.  If a bard or BL is slowing, they certainly are not the main healer.  Nice try at twisting my words around, but it's not going to work.<br />
<br />
No, shamans don't need to worry about slow bouncing all that much with their debuffs, so there's not even nearly the problem that you would like to make it out to be. It's about as much for a problem for a shaman as healer and slower, as it is for a cleric or a druid with a beastlord or bard slower. <br />
<br />
Slow bounces, it happens.  I never claimed it was an every pull kinda thing, but it does happen often enough that is is an issue, more so as you cface more challenging content usually(ie when you really don't want it to bounce).  It is not as much of a problem with a bard or BL or chanter slower as opposed to a shaman handling both slow and heals, simply because if a BL, bard or chanter bounces slow, the healer covers the healing, and they immedietly recast slow.  If a shaman is both healing and slowing, he is faced with what can be a bad situation, needing to both heal with a shaman's small heals, and get the mob slowed asap.<br />
<br />
Yeah, you're right. That's why the versatile shaman usually only does one of them, and assumes another role. That's why they're so good. They're not like a chanter and stuck in the CC/slower/haster role, for example. <br />
<br />
It's better to be stuck in the slower/buffer/healer role?  Both are primarily slowers, and most generally that is the slot they go to.  For this slot they are in competition, and as I have pointed out many times, to my mind, a chanter brings far more to the group than a shaman does.  With a chanter, the group will kill faster, and somewhat safer.<br />
<br />
Not going to quote out your last three paragraphs, it is basically one long thought.  You say I downplay what a shaman can do, and play up what other classes can do.  I don't think that is it, what I think you are seeing is that I value  what the other classes bring more than what a shaman brings.  Shaman can slow, heal(marginally), DPS(marginally), buff.  Enchanters can slow, DPS, buff, CC by mez, BL's can slow, DPS, buff, and bards can do slow(marginally), and just about everything else.  In order of how I value these things it is slows, DPS, buffs.  I find that the contribution the other classes bring in terms of DPS(both in terms of increases to group DPS and their own), far outweigh shamans best slow, and all their other abilities.<br />
<br />
Maybe you guys just group with shitty shamans, because if you've seen HALF of the shit I've seen a shaman do, you wouldn't be calling them underpowered. <br />
<br />
There are players of every class who really take the class to it's logical limits.  Shaman have them too, and I had the privledge to spend some time with one of our servers acknowledged best.  I remember a Saturday morning in Tactics with him, at first he was healer and slower, but we had serious issues, and he found us a cleric, cuz it was just too hard to keep up with both.</div></div><hr />

I deleveled to be with my friend's Clerics in LDoN, you are FAR from Uber and I have probably raided as much as you have. EQ is now the home of the ebayed and PLed pansy. Everything is 100 times easier, or they wouldn't play. Everyone is just distracting from the melee DPS that NEEDS to be done with a bunch of crap that is hardly true. Shaman is NOT underpowered. I play a 57th, my roomy plays a 65th, we just don't put &quot;lfg&quot; tag on and go solo. Put a little WORK into getting groups, Warriors have to, the lfg tag is NOT enough to get you a group in EQ!</div></div><hr />

Yes, it does drop in VT, and on my server, that is done by a total of 2 guilds right now.  Not a spell 90+ % of shaman have or will ever have. <br />
<br />
Yeah, true to my comment at the beginning, you're going to make like it somehow doesn't matter, this spell that goes against a point you're trying to make, because it's a rarer spell. I say, that's a load of crap.<br />
Let me tell you something, there are, on my server, 5 guilds that have farmed VT. 2 guilds that are farming it now, and another couple guilds that are getting close to that level. When YOU YOURSELF limit it to the 65 +AA's crowd, that's a fairly significant number of shamans.  <br />
<br />
If you comprehend so well, then you can explain how listing mana cost for each spell, and then listing the total mana cost is in any way misleading.  If you could not follow that chain, you have serious problems with simple reading comprehension.  I apear  to be doing nothing but exactly what I ws doing, listing spell mana costs, and keeping a running total.<br />
Pretty simple, Redhenna. It was your words, and phrasing, that left that impression. If you don't understand that choice of words and phrasing don't put a spin of something that you say, then, well...<br />
<br />
 Only in outdoor zones.  Yes, there are zones other then BoT in this game.<br />
So? What, are you trying to say it somehow doesn't matter? Only in LDoN in areas that are fought in any more are horses not used. In nearly EVERY PoP zone in the game, including the only good experience zones in the game, guess what, it's OUTDOOR. Again, you pull the paladin trick... ignore it or minimize it if it does'n tsupport what you'd have us believe, and maximize every point that seems to support what you want us to believe.<br />
As for your comment that there are other zones than BoT in this game... No, really, ya think?<br />
<br />
Then it is time to find a different group.  Downtime is the devil.<br />
No. Redhenna, it's called having fun, it's called hanging out with your friends, it's called not taking the game way too seriously. Leaviong a group because it isn't chain killing. Sheesh. <br />
 <br />
And many times they will not have all the buffs I listed.  I tried to make a nice list of buffs + focus effects + AA that would yield something like a semi meaningfull number.  Truth is, whether you like to admit it or not, that a shaman is mana limited(as well as time limited) on what they can do.  That was the whole point of the numbers.<br />
Mana limited? Everyone is mana limited... What you would like to ignore is the fact is that the shaman is one of the least mana limited characters of any class in the GAME. Why? because that's a strength of the shaman, and that's a point in favor of shamans, and you don't want to acknowledge it, because of that fact.<br />
<br />
Enchanters.  Can debuff with tash and cripple, can slow, can buff KEI line, haste, NDT, DPS with COD/DC pet, plus nukes, and they can do it very well.  Don't you just hate making a strong comment like that, and have it turn out to be entirely wrong?<br />
Enchanters, DPS? Ridiculous. DC pets don't do great DPS. Not only that, much as you might make it out to be every chanter has a DC pet or a CoD pet in his pocket to pull out? That just not the case. It's *at best* a situational ability, and the better DPS it is, the rarer it is. <br />
<br />
And yet I frequently group with BL's and bards who can do it.  I notice you forgot to mention chanters again...they are so inconvienient to your argument.<br />
No, I'm not mentioning chanters because they're not at issue as such supposed powerful replacements to shamans as a slower and haster by EITHER SIDE. Your baseless assertion to the contrary.<br />
Tell me, you say your groups, beastlords and bards both do this? Really... Where's the beastlord that can debuff, hmmm? Yeah, you're right, they don't, which means you're full of it. And bards... you seriously going to call them DPS? ROFL, don't be ridiculous. Bard melee is among the weakest, if not THE weakest, in the game.<br />
<br />
the shaman has to debuff and slow firs, and only then can DoT,<br />
Has to? You're completely full of it. A shaman doesn't HAVE TO debuff and slow crap. you know those chanters you say I'm ignoring? Yeah, they have a good slow spell too, which is &quot;good enough&quot; that they can do it. Yeah, mages? They can debuff too. Voila, the shaman can concentrate of DoT's, just like the shaman. <br />
<br />
 The only reason I can see to have a shaman in a group when I already have a chanter would be that I simply cannot find a cleric or druid to heal, and that is rare.<br />
Of course that's how you feel. You've already convinced yourself that shamans are a crappy underpowered class. Needless to say, almost everyone else is disagreeing with you here on that.<br />
<br />
You are getting desperate.<br />
Not at all. I'm just shoving your own tactics right back at you.<br />
<br />
It's better to be stuck in the slower/buffer/healer role?  Both are primarily slowers, and most generally that is the slot they go to.  For this slot they are in competition, and as I have pointed out many times, to my mind, a chanter brings far more to the group than a shaman does.  With a chanter, the group will kill faster, and somewhat safer.<br />
<br />
With a chanter, they're NOT going to kill somewhat faster. UNLESS they are able to take advantage of charm, which is situational. Much as you'd have us believe a chanter's always carrying around a DC or CoD pet, and that he's always able to use them with no problem. Not only that, the chanter can't heal, can't buff HPS. However, the chanter CAN mez. A shaman can't.<br />
<br />
No, Redhenna. They don't bring MORE. They just bring DIFFERENT abilities.<br />
<br />
 Enchanters can slow, DPS, buff, CC by mez, BL's can slow, DPS, buff, and bards can do slow(marginally), and just about everything else.  In order of how I value these things it is slows, DPS, buffs.  I find that the contribution the other classes bring in terms of DPS(both in terms of increases to group DPS and their own), far outweigh shamans best slow, and all their other abilities.<br />
Let me correct that for you.<br />
<br />
 Enchanters can slow, DPS(marginally), buff(marginally), CC by mez, BL's can slow(averagely), DPS(depends on mana usage, if high, the DPS is extremely average), buff(average), and bards can do slow(marginally), and just about everything else(to a limited extent, usually maxed at 2 other things at a time)<br />
That's fine that you think shamans suck... everyone has a right to their own opinion. But look at just about all the other people in this thread... they realize how powerful shamans are, and they understand that they're just fine. You're quite significantly in the minority here.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
No, my words and phrases where quite explicit, if you cannot comprehend them, that is your problem.<br />

No. Redhenna, it's called having fun, it's called hanging out with your friends, it's called not taking the game way too seriously. Leaviong a group because it isn't chain killing. Sheesh.  <br />
<br />
If I am hanging out with friends, efficiency isn't what I am after.  If I am doing a pickup group, I want fast hard pulling.<br />
<br />
Mana limited? Everyone is mana limited... What you would like to ignore is the fact is that the shaman is one of the least mana limited characters of any class in the GAME. Why? because that's a strength of the shaman, and that's a point in favor of shamans, and you don't want to acknowledge it, because of that fact. <br />
<br />
It is also why they have some of the least efficient spells in the game.  They have awesome mana regen, but high spell costs to balance that.  True to what you claim I do, you forget little details inconvienient to your argument.<br />
<br />
Enchanters, DPS? Ridiculous. DC pets don't do great DPS. Not only that, much as you might make it out to be every chanter has a DC pet or a CoD pet in his pocket to pull out? That just not the case. It's *at best* a situational ability, and the better DPS it is, the rarer it is.  <br />
<br />
DC pet's are not 'great', but they are decent DPS(about in linewith mage pets from my understanding).  DC pets are available in almost any zone.  CoD is more rare, but with CoD, a chanter becomes a DPS powerhouse.  Chanter DPS is not great, and does not match up usually with a DPS class, but is far better than shaman DPS.<br />
<br />
 Where's the beastlord that can debuff, hmmm? Yeah, you're right, they don't, which means you're full of it. <br />
<br />
Not every mob needs to be debuffed.  It is nice, but not mandatory.  And, as you point out soon 'Yeah, mages? They can debuff too'.   So, apparently, it is you that is full of it.<br />
<br />
And bards... you seriously going to call them DPS? ROFL, don't be ridiculous. Bard melee is among the weakest, if not THE weakest, in the game. <br />

2:  Increase Haste v3 by 30% <br />
3:  Limit: Effect(Hitpoints allowed) <br />
4:  Limit: Instant spells only <br />

<br />
<br />
So, by having a bard in group, with just 1 song, they can up groups nuke damage by 15 %, and add 30 % v3 haste.  And that is just one song.  You are right, bards don't do great DPS, but they make everyone else do much better DPS.<br />
<br />
Has to? You're completely full of it. A shaman doesn't HAVE TO debuff and slow crap. you know those chanters you say I'm ignoring? Yeah, they have a good slow spell too, which is &quot;good enough&quot; that they can do it. Yeah, mages? They can debuff too. Voila, the shaman can concentrate of DoT's, just like the shaman.  <br />
<br />
True, but I question again, what do you need a shaman for in that group?  DPS?  Nope, even when concentrating on it, shaman are not good DPS.  Healing?  Nope, they are not that good a healer.  So what is the shaman doing there?<br />
<br />
Of course that's how you feel. You've already convinced yourself that shamans are a crappy underpowered class. Needless to say, almost everyone else is disagreeing with you here on that. <br />
<br />
So go ahead, tell me why you would want a low DPS class, with piss poor heals, in your group if they are not using their one strong ability, slowing.<br />
<br />
With a chanter, they're NOT going to kill somewhat faster. UNLESS they are able to take advantage of charm, which is situational. Much as you'd have us believe a chanter's always carrying around a DC or CoD pet, and that he's always able to use them with no problem. Not only that, the chanter can't heal, can't buff HPS. However, the chanter CAN mez. A shaman can't. <br />
<br />
Wrong, and so wrong.  With a chanter, you will kill faster.  DC/CoD is not situational, almost every zone has mobs there for just that purpose.  I admit fully that many enchanters do not COD(tho they should to my mind), but I have never met an enchanter with DC who did not use it. <br />
<br />
Enchanters can slow, DPS(marginally), buff(marginally), CC by mez, BL's can slow(averagely), DPS(depends on mana usage, if high, the DPS is extremely average), buff(average), and bards can do slow(marginally), and just about everything else(to a limited extent, usually maxed at 2 other things at a time) <br />
<br />
Wow, lies and exagerations galore.  Assuming a DC pet is about on par with a mage pet(I have no parses, this is based on things I have been told, but sounds reasonable), it does about 70 DPS.  Enchanters have an 1100 point nuke as well(200 greater than shaman).  A chanter with 1 nuke and pet can close in on 100 DPS, a shaman would be lucky to ever get that.  DPS average at least for enchanters.  marginal bufs = best mana regen buffs, best haste, and decent atack buffs.  Wow, marginal must not mean what I thought.  Bl buffs are average...they buff better than shaman...more hp's, more attack, and have a mana regen buff.  So you get a few less points of agi...they are still all things concidered a better buff class than shaman.  Bards with those 2 other songs can in fact do far more than 2 things, see the song I listed above.<br />
<br />
But look at just about all the other people in this thread... they realize how powerful shamans are, and they understand that they're just fine <br />
<br />
And when warriors started having trouble, at first everyone said the same thing...warriors just did not realize how powerfull we were(we could group tank, and where needed for raiding...and we had defensive).  Shaman issues are a tough sell here, in part because warriors have greater issues than shaman(and before the melee patch, far far far more problems than shaman dreamed of having).  Also, as a pure melee, warriors can underapreciate the mana regen that the other 3 slow classes offer(an example being you calling enchanter buffs marginal...ask a wizzy if enchanter buffs are maginal).  It is also easy to point to shaman strengths(slow, ability to solo, great mana regen and can do alot of things at least a little bit), and miss that when compared to other classes that they are competing with, they loose a bit.  The buffs you are so stuck on do casters little good, while all 3 other slowers do help mana regen.  The DPS they add to a group, both directly and indirectly, is lower than any of the other 3.  They heal better than the other 3 classes, but that is almost like saying that rangers heal better than warriors...it's true, but not the whole picture.</div></div><hr />

I also prefer having nearly all my stats maxed. An enchanter can't do this.<br />
<br />
You can argue until you're blue in the face that an enchanter's superior haste is greater than the shaman's superior slow, or a shaman's healing ability and dots aren't as significant as an enchanters mezzing and charm, or whatever other argument you want to make. Obviously, just as every other class can do some things better than another class can and some classes have one or two unique abilities, so do shaman's and enchanters have certain checks and balances that make them better for certain tasks. I will still choose a shaman over an enchanter unless there is a dire need for mezzing, and in my average group that need just isn't present.</div></div><hr />

Uh, no... the Ancient is just one of several of a type of spell that every shaman has access to, and which if not every one at this level, 99% of them have the benefit of &lt;Cough&gt;Blood of Sarym&lt;cough&gt; Not everyone in the game has access to a DBoTW/EoE combo. Not even everyone in the game has access to a Hategiver and BoC, which would be a more appropriate comparison.<br />
<br />
 No, my words and phrases where quite explicit, if you cannot comprehend them, that is your problem.<br />
No, I understood them quite fine, thank you. In fact I already mentioned that I did, and my comment was that it could be interpreted otherwise, not that I didn't understand it, so your comment shows that YOU just might have a problem with reading comprehension. <br />
<br />
 /cough Tactics.  Doh, you loose again.<br />
I said NEARLY, dumbass. What was that you were saying about reading comprehension? Here's another freebie for you. Sol Ro. but ya know what, that's 2 of what, 20ish zones? And yeah, I don't call Tactics good experience. Elemental, on the other hand, is a completely different story. But, you know what, if I have to look at it from a PoV regular's perspective, you know what, you're perfectly right, Tactics IS a good XP zone with no horses.<br />
 <br />
It is also why they have some of the least efficient spells in the game.<br />
They also have some of the MOST efficient spells in the game. &lt;cough&gt;quiessence&lt;cough&gt; EVERY class has less efficient spells for areas that they're designed to not be strong in. Chanter and shaman nukes, paladin heals, anyone? Sorry, try again. Nice attempt to paint the picture of shamans having all these mana hogging spells, so they spend more mana per spell than other classes, though. <br />
<br />
DC pet's are not 'great', but they are decent DPS(about in linewith mage pets from my understanding).  DC pets are available in almost any zone.<br />
<br />
&lt;cough&gt;LDoN&lt;cough&gt; Overstating your case again... only in PoP,  are they widely available.<br />
<br />
CoD is more rare, but with CoD, a chanter becomes a DPS powerhouse.<br />
A chanter also becomes in great danger of his life, and can spend more time being rezzed, rebuffed, and medding than contributing DPS. Not to mention that when the chanter dies to a pissed pet, all of a sudden you get an add from angry pet, and yer CC is dead.... course I don't see you mentioning that... you'll just extoll the virtues of how much DPS the chanter can do, and conveniently forget about the balance... the danger involved.<br />
<br />
Chanter DPS is not great, and does not match up usually with a DPS class, but is far better than shaman DPS.<br />
<br />
Heh, no, I don't think so. Prove that it's far better than shaman DPS. Truth is, even DC chanter DPS and shaman DPS is about comparable. But by all means, let's see some parses.<br />
<br />
Not every mob needs to be debuffed.  It is nice, but not mandatory.  And, as you point out soon 'Yeah, mages? They can debuff too'.   So, apparently, it is you that is full of it.<br />
<br />
Bullshit. YOU were the one claiming that beastlords can do these things, INCLUDING debuff. Nice attempt at a diversion, though.<br />
<br />
I also like how you go from one post, claiming,<br />
<br />
the shaman has to debuff and slow first<br />
and then turn 180 degrees when it suits your purpose:<br />
Not every mob needs to be debuffed.  It is nice, but not mandatory.<br />
Uh huh.<br />
<br />
So, by having a bard in group, with just 1 song, they can up groups nuke damage by 15 %, and add 30 % v3 haste.  And that is just one song.  You are right, bards don't do great DPS, but they make everyone else do much better DPS.<br />
What the hell does buffing have to do with that character's DPS? We were talking about your bullcrap claim that bards are DPS, not that they can buff others to have better DPS!<br />
 You can't defend your claim, so you have to twist and then all of a start with the &quot;well, but they can buff THIS!&quot; crap?<br />
You wanna start with that, I can play that game too. It's a little spell, called Ferine Avatar? Yeah, it ups melee damage SIGNIFICANTLY. Yeah, and another spell, called swift like the wind? Pumps your haste up to cap if you have raid haste. FoS? Sta? they're great on adding more HPS so that your chanter has more of a chance to survive when he's getting the crap kicked out of him by his charmed pet that just broke charm and turned on him...<br />
Nice wriggling, though.<br />
<br />
True, but I question again, what do you need a shaman for in that group? DPS? Nope, even when concentrating on it, shaman are not good DPS. Healing? Nope, they are not that good a healer. So what is the shaman doing there?<br />
So go ahead, tell me why you would want a low DPS class, with piss poor heals, in your group if they are not using their one strong ability, slowing.<br />
Sure, they're not rogue DPS. Sure, they're not monk DPS. But you know what, they're decent at it. They're solidly middle of the pack in the game spectrum for DPS. And ya know what, they can augment the crap out of the rest of the group as well, and make them perform better, and take a hit better. Allow me to suggest that if you don't know what you're supposed to do in a group, that you should simply delete your shaman and level up one of those bards or beastlords you've got the hots for.<br />
Piss poor heals. 1200HP for 200 mana, UNFOCUSED, and they're whining about piss poor heals. Cry me a river. Why don't you go whine to the rangers, beastlords, or even the paladins about your &quot;piss poor heals&quot; and see what reaction you get.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Wrong, and so wrong.  With a chanter, you will kill faster.  DC/CoD is not situational, almost every zone has mobs there for just that purpose.  I admit fully that many enchanters do not COD(tho they should to my mind), but I have never met an enchanter with DC who did not use it.<br />
Charm NOT situational. What a retarded claim.<br />
<br />
Question for you.<br />
Do chanters always, in every case, have a CoD or DC pet?<br />
No?<br />
Then guess what, buddy. DC/CoD is SITUATIONAL. A shaman ALWAYS has his DoT's, pet, and the like, the chanter does NOT always have his charmed pet. Often, at the 65+AA level? Yes. But not all the time like you would have us believe.<br />
Oh, and your claim about mobs being there just for that purpose? Only DC pets, and only in PoP. LDoN, charm and DC opportunities are next to non existent in comparison... and they were balanced that way on purpose.<br />
I've grouped with chanters with DC in zones iwth DC pets, who were grumping about how they can't find a DC pet to charm.<br />
No, I'm not saying DC isn't common to see, but it sure isn't EVERY time.<br />
<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Wow, lies and exagerations galore.   Enchanters have an 1100 point nuke as well(200 greater than shaman).<br />
<br />
175, actually. Lies and exxagerations? Pot, kettle, black.<br />
<br />
 A chanter with 1 nuke and pet can close in on 100 DPS, a shaman would be lucky to ever get that.<br />
No, they wouldn't.<br />
<br />
DPS average at least for enchanters.  marginal bufs = best mana regen buffs, best haste, and decent atack buffs.  Wow, marginal must not mean what I thought.<br />
<br />
Yeah, marginal. To anyone but a caster, anyway. Haste, MR, Cx, very moderate attack buffs. We ARE comparing to a shaman, with haste, tribunal, Fo7, boar, daiku, Bih'Li, wrulan, Avatar. Only one buff I'm ever interested in form a chanter, and that's haste. That's it.<br />
<br />
Bl buffs are average...they buff better than shaman...more hp's, more attack, and have a mana regen buff.<br />
Every single buff that beastlords have in the shaman line is overwrriten by shamans, as their versions are, guess what, BETTER. Not only that, they have to waste several times the buff slots, and use more mana for a shorter duration of buff. So I'll say they only buff averagely. No, all those buffs, all those slots, all those buffs fading all the time for some fairly insignificantly better HPS and atk, and that's only IF the BST is able to keep all his buffs up at once. No, that's REALLY reaching. I also don't see you mentioning that the mana regen buff they have is the worst of its type in the game. Nor do I see your mentioning the haste of a beastlord, which is inferior to BOTH a shaman and a chanter. Par for the course, for you.<br />
<br />
they are still all things concidered a better buff class than shaman.<br />
<br />
ROFLMAO. Um. No. Just plain no. That claim is nothing short of ridiculous.<br />
<br />
Question... on a raid, who does the buffing, BST or shaman? That's right, the shaman does. Because, guess what, their buffs are BETTER.<br />
<br />
Bards with those 2 other songs can in fact do far more than 2 things, see the song I listed above.<br />
FAR more than the 2 things? No, I don't think so, you're overstating your case again. You're right in that the songs do more than one thing, but that's an argument that's reaching. Do we now count every single effect that a spell has as a &quot;different&quot; thing?<br />
<br />
So what, cleric's Virtue counts as several things at once because it buffs HP AND AC? A shaman's Fo7th spell also does more things at once because it buffs HP AND it buffs stats? Beastlords, because SD buffs both mana and health?<br />
<br />
You're reaching in your desperation.<br />
<br />
The buffs you are so stuck on do casters little good, while all 3 other slowers do help mana regen.<br />
Uh huh, and a shaman does more for the melee than any of the other 3. It's called balance.<br />
<br />
The DPS they add to a group, both directly and indirectly, is lower than any of the other 3.<br />
<br />
Bullshit. Prove how a shaman offers less, directly AND indirectly, with his haste PLUS pet PLUS DoT's PLUS attack buffs, than ANY of the other 3. I tell you right now, you can't. Why? Because it simply is not true. That's what you BELIEVE, and that's all.<br />
<br />
They heal better than the other 3 classes, but that is almost like saying that rangers heal better than warriors...it's true, but not the whole picture. <br />
<br />
That amuses the hell out of me... First you go, well, the other 3 classes do this better than a shaman does! on a statement that supports your point. Then you go the complete opposite way conceding that yeah, shamans DO heal better, but then you go and try and minimize that benefit, saying that's not the whole picture.<br />
<br />
Here's a clue for ya, buddy. when you say that shamans buffs don't do anything for casters (which is bull, by the way, fragile casters LOVE more hitpoints, which shamans provide), THAT'S NOT THE WHOLE PICTURE!<br />
<br />
Quit trying to play it both ways.</div></div><hr />

Enchanters get Insanity, 1100 for 300 mana, 6 second cast 8 second recast.<br />
<br />
If all you're doing is nuking, Enchanter comes out to be 78.6 DPS while Shaman figures out at 92.0 DPS.<br />
<br />
The efficiency of nuke hardly matters since Shamans have way better mana regen than Enchanters (or any other class for that matter).  <br />
<br />
And before you say an Enchanter can do something weird like having two nukes loaded, I have never seen an enchanter with 2 nukes loaded, ever.  They're complaining about not having enough spell slots as it is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And both are far easier to come by than an ancient spell.  You have totally lost track of what you are arguing, and just making it easier on me.<br />
<br />
 In fact I already mentioned that I did, and my comment was that it could be interpreted otherwise, not that I didn't understand it, so your comment shows that YOU just might have a problem with reading comprehension.  <br />
<br />
You took an explicit listing, stated that I was trying to make it look like I was claiming all the mana was being used to DoT with(when I specifically listed the mana used by each spell), and now want to suggest that my reading comprehension lacks?  No, try again, you can twist my words, and try and make blind accusations, but you will only fail.<br />
<br />
<br />
I said NEARLY, dumbass <br />
<br />
Um, no you said:  'including the only good experience zones in the game, guess what, it's OUTDOOR.'.  I strongly suggest before calling names you at least try and be right.  Sucks to be caught flat out lieing about what you say, doesn't it, dumbass.<br />
<br />
<br />
They also have some of the MOST efficient spells in the game. &lt;cough&gt;quiessence&lt;cough&gt; <br />
<br />
Q is very effiecient, yes.  Name some more tho.  Over all shaman spells are very innefficient, and if you really want to claim otherwise, I will happily list spells and spell costs.<br />
<br />
&lt;cough&gt;LDoN&lt;cough&gt; Overstating your case again... only in PoP, are they widely available. <br />
<br />
So one expansion lacks DC pets?  Wow, that is alot.  Note that LDoN does make charmable mobs in every zone.<br />
<br />
A chanter also becomes in great danger of his life, and can spend more time being rezzed, rebuffed, and medding than contributing DPS. Not to mention that when the chanter dies to a pissed pet, all of a sudden you get an add from angry pet, and yer CC is dead.... course I don't see you mentioning that... you'll just extoll the virtues of how much DPS the chanter can do, and conveniently forget about the balance... the danger involved. <br />
<br />
Funny thing is, I spent this afternoon grouped with a chanter iwth a CoD pet.  No deaths, 1 real close call.  If people are on their toes, it is not that hard, once the chanter has the right AA's.  Yes, there are added risks, bit the DPS increase more than makes up for it.<br />
<br />
A shaman ALWAYS has his DoT's, pet, and the like, the chanter does NOT always have his charmed pet. Often, at the 65+AA level? Yes. But not all the time like you would have us believe. <br />
<br />
I can live with that statement.  DC and CoD are powerfull tools that are avaialable, but there are certain situations that rarely do not allow them to be used.<br />
<br />
and then turn 180 degrees when it suits your purpose: <br />
<br />
You stated that not every mob neaded to be debuffed, and I agreed, that you had a point...oh, terrible me.<br />
<br />
What the hell does buffing have to do with that character's DPS? We were talking about your bullcrap claim that bards are DPS, not that they can buff others to have better DPS!<br />
You can't defend your claim, so you have to twist and then all of a start with the &quot;well, but they can buff THIS!&quot; crap?<br />
You wanna start with that, I can play that game too. It's a little spell, called Ferine Avatar? Yeah, it ups melee damage SIGNIFICANTLY. Yeah, and another spell, called swift like the wind? Pumps your haste up to cap if you have raid haste. FoS? Sta? they're great on adding more HPS so that your chanter has more of a chance to survive when he's getting the crap kicked out of him by his charmed pet that just broke charm and turned on him...<br />
Nice wriggling, though.<br />
 <br />
<br />
Ah, you are one of those.  You look at individuals, not groups.  Let me clue you in a sec here.  The goal of a group is to kill mobs as fast as possible, as safe as possible.  Group DPS matters, individual DPS is nothing outside what it contributes to a group(outside soloing obviously).  Bards do have significant DPS on their own, but enhance group DPS significantly.  yes, shaman up a groups DPS with buffs as you point out, but enchanters provide more haste, plus mind buffs so your DPS classes can do more, plus smaller attack buffs.  BL's provide more raw attack, increasing the groups DPS more, plus mana regen, that helps the casters do more DPS.  Bards as pointed out do major increases to a groups DPS.<br />
<br />
Sure, they're not rogue DPS. Sure, they're not monk DPS. But you know what, they're decent at it. They're solidly middle of the pack in the game spectrum for DPS. And ya know what, they can augment the crap out of the rest of the group as well, and make them perform better, and take a hit better. Allow me to suggest that if you don't know what you're supposed to do in a group, that you should simply delete your shaman and level up one of those bards or beastlords you've got the hots for.<br />
Piss poor heals. 1200HP for 200 mana, UNFOCUSED, and they're whining about piss poor heals. Cry me a river. Why don't you go whine to the rangers, beastlords, or even the paladins about your &quot;piss poor heals&quot; and see what reaction you get.<br />
<br />
They are roughly around warrior DPS, I would call that lower end.  The buffs they have only accent melee DPS, not caster DPS I might add(all 3 other slower classes can add to both), and at least one of the 3 classes will provide a bigger boost to melee damage(ferocity is awesome, more attack than FA).  The heal you keep mentioning does 300 per tick, wich is nice, provided you get hit only once every 6 seconds, for less than 300.  It is great for buying time for the other shaan heal, Tnarg's...1300 hp's for 450 mana.<br />
<br />
<br />
Then guess what, buddy. DC/CoD is SITUATIONAL. A shaman ALWAYS has his DoT's, pet, and the like, the chanter does NOT always have his charmed pet. Often, at the 65+AA level? Yes. But not all the time like you would have us believe. <br />
<br />
The ability is there for them to use, and the mobs are there to be charmed.  Yes, some chanters don't charm...but then some shaman don't bother to make a pet, or bother to canni.  Should we balance around that?<br />
<br />
175, actually. Lies and exxagerations? Pot, kettle, black. <br />
<br />
I stand coorected.  That 25 damage makes a huge difference I am sure.<br />
<br />
Yeah, marginal. To anyone but a caster, anyway. Haste, MR, Cx, very moderate attack buffs. We ARE comparing to a shaman, with haste, tribunal, Fo7, boar, daiku, Bih'Li, wrulan, Avatar. Only one buff I'm ever interested in form a chanter, and that's haste. That's it. <br />
<br />
To anyone but a caster you say...so in other words, all but 3 classes.  Cx benefits far more classes than FA, daiku or wrulan, or bih`li for that matter.  Stop thinking as a melee for a minute and thing from a caster point of view, you will see that chanters are very strong when it comes to buffs.<br />
<br />
Every single buff that beastlords have in the shaman line is overwrriten by shamans, as their versions are, guess what, BETTER. Not only that, they have to waste several times the buff slots, and use more mana for a shorter duration of buff. So I'll say they only buff averagely. No, all those buffs, all those slots, all those buffs fading all the time for some fairly insignificantly better HPS and atk, and that's only IF the BST is able to keep all his buffs up at once. No, that's REALLY reaching. I also don't see you mentioning that the mana regen buff they have is the worst of its type in the game. Nor do I see your mentioning the haste of a beastlord, which is inferior to BOTH a shaman and a chanter. Par for the course, for you. <br />
<br />
This is one of my favorites.  You clain I am reaching by suggesting that a shaman can keep every buff up on someone(I actually only ask for 5 IoS/Kragg/SV/Fero/Haste), and they last a reasonable amount of time.  Then you point out that BL mana regen buffs are the worst in the game, when in fact it is one more mana per tick than Pot9, and totally discounts paragon.  You also fail to note that a BL can buff more hp's than a shaamn, and more attack.  But I am reaching by calling them a good buff class.<br />
<br />
Question... on a raid, who does the buffing, BST or shaman? That's right, the shaman does. Because, guess what, their buffs are BETTER.<br />
<br />
Time to make you look foolish again.  Both buff.  Shaman buffs are used for stat/focus line, due to fewer buff slots used, and stacking.  BL's buff SD(remember, not everyone in a raid is pure melee), and Ferocity, and sometimes SV for those who prefer it to BSS and SoTuna.  Either you are incredibly ignorant of raiding outside your one class, or you are being outright deceptive with the above statement.<br />
<br />
FAR more than the 2 things? No, I don't think so, you're overstating your case again. You're right in that the songs do more than one thing, but that's an argument that's reaching. Do we now count every single effect that a spell has as a &quot;different&quot; thing? <br />
<br />
I have no issue with doing that.  In fact, I wish more buffs combined multiple effects, as I always have to click off unwanted buffs on raids to make room for ones I need.<br />
<br />
Uh huh, and a shaman does more for the melee than any of the other 3. It's called balance. <br />
<br />
No actually the BL does at least as much, if not more for the melee.<br />
<br />
Bullshit. Prove how a shaman offers less, directly AND indirectly, with his haste PLUS pet PLUS DoT's PLUS attack buffs, than ANY of the other 3. I tell you right now, you can't. Why? Because it simply is not true. That's what you BELIEVE, and that's all. <br />
<br />
Prove that I am wrong.  Prove that wizzies are not about the best DPS class, and their DPS is improved by every class but shaman.  Hell, a mage can outDPS most melee.  Shaman improve melee damage, no doubt.  Enchanters inmprove both melee damage and caster damage.  BL's inprove both melee damage, and caster damage, and so do bards.  I have just in this paragraph offered more support for my claim than you have for yours.<br />
<br />
Here's a clue for ya, buddy. when you say that shamans buffs don't do anything for casters (which is bull, by the way, fragile casters LOVE more hitpoints, which shamans provide), THAT'S NOT THE WHOLE PICTURE! <br />
<br />
True, most casters do love more hp's.  They do not improve their effectiveness much, but they do love them, less chance of dying.  Now start asking other casters who they would prefer in a group.  Do they want the hp's from a shaman, or the mana regen from a chanter...or the mana regen and hp's from a BL, or the mana regen, and focus effect from a bard.  The problem you have is that you  lack to see the whole picture, and look at it more from a pure melee point of view(which is kinda natural), and fail to remember that all but 3 classes in EQ use mana.<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Note, I am calling it quits from this argument.  We are going around in circles, and saying the same things, and not convincing the other.  Feel free to take your last rebuttal, and then let's agree to disagree, and move onto other topics.  This one has gooten stale.  You do have some legitimate points, and I hope I have made some as well.  Class balance as always is subjective, and therefore there will always be disagreement.</div></div><hr />

No. I haven't. You were the one getting off on a tangent about them, and then accused ME of loosing track of my original argument. Nice play, tho.<br />

<br />
I wasn't lying, thanks. I already addressed this... good thing you lack the READING COMPREHENSION to no understood what I said, and attack me anyway...<br />
<br />
Q is very effiecient, yes.  Name some more tho.  Over all shaman spells are very innefficient, and if you really want to claim otherwise, I will happily list spells and spell costs.<br />
<br />
How about thier buffs, which are more efficient than a beastlords. How about their DoT's, which, especially their long duration buffs, are are among the most damage per mana in the game. Let's take, for example. Breath of Ultor. 3354 for 540 mana. I'll go off memory here, and a wizard's most efficient damage, I beleive, is 2740 for 640 mana! LESS damage, for MORE mana!<br />
Oh, that beastlord spell you're so hot and horny over, Savagery? It costs SIX HUNDRED mana to the shaman's 350.<br />
Doh, you lose again.<br />
<br />
So one expansion lacks DC pets?  Wow, that is alot.  Note that LDoN does make charmable mobs in every zone.<br />
<br />
...and what you don't mention, is that it's extremely limited, last I heard, to a single mob type, on top of all the other limititations and dangers of charm. Try to charm the wrong one, and you're gonn hae some problems.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ah, you are one of those.  You look at individuals, not groups.  Let me clue you in a sec here.  The goal of a group is to kill mobs as fast as possible, as safe as possible.<br />
<br />
As you were were jsut talking about how chanters are so good with their charmed pets. You wanna talk about a clue? Here's one. CHARM IS NOT SAFE! You wanna say charm roxxors so much, BY YOUR OWN STANDARDS a group doesn't like it because of the added danger level. Course you only bust out and change your argumenets when it suits you, just like this one...<br />
<br />
yes, shaman up a groups DPS with buffs as you point out, but enchanters provide more haste, plus mind buffs so your DPS classes can do more, plus smaller attack buffs.<br />
<br />
Weren't you just trying to make a  point about another clas adding something with traded buffs? Fine, here's one for you. Trade a FoSeventh for a c3 that can last SEVEARL HOURS and you can have your cake, AND eat it to. No need for a chanter at all then, unless you wanna mez something or you don't have 41% haste.<br />
<br />
BL's provide more raw attack, increasing the groups DPS more, plus mana regen, that helps the casters do more DPS.  Bards as pointed out do major increases to a groups DPS<br />
<br />
Yeah, bards can't get you to haste cap, even with the best haste iitem in the game without wasting 1/3 of their abilities on haste alone, unless they have epic. So unless they're epic'd, in which case they rely on unreliable procs, when they're doin haste, mana, slow, they're maxed out. I will say one thing, an epic'd bard with a Marr clicky is MUCH more powerful, but they're still limited to the 3 things with the songs, for the most part.<br />
Beastlords, they CANNOT get you to haste cap. At all. Ever. So those attack buffs you're trumping as so awesome? ALL that minor (and situational!) bonus has been wiped out. The only thing they're better on is mana regen.<br />
Bards are good when you allow them to augment present abilities, or give them a limited role of their own. If you're putting them in a shaman's spot, or a chanter's spot, they suck at it. Even in a group with a beatlord, they perform better.<br />
<br />
and at least one of the 3 classes will provide a bigger boost to melee damage(ferocity is awesome, more attack than FA).<br />
<br />
No. They won't. Two words. Haste cap.<br />
<br />
The heal you keep mentioning does 300 per tick, wich is nice, provided you get hit only once every 6 seconds, for less than 300.  It is great for buying time for the other shaman heal, Tnarg's...1300 hp's for 450 mana.<br />
<br />
Talk about your deceptive arguments.  No, to put it in realistic terms, it heals 50DPS, unfocused. If you can take that in damage, quiess will keep you alive all by itself. As soon as the shaman puts some AA'S into it, and gets an IH item, it's more like a 2k heal for 200 mana. That ALONE can keep a tank's ass a live in lower tier PoP, with the shaman's mana regen. Plus the shaman can add DPS on top of slowing.<br />
<br />
To anyone but a caster you say...so in other words, all but 3 classes.<br />
Nice try. They're called hybrids, perhaps you've heard of them....<br />
<br />
Cx benefits far more classes than FA, daiku or wrulan, or bih`li for that matter.  Stop thinking as a melee for a minute and thing from a caster point of view, you will see that chanters are very strong when it comes to buffs.<br />
Chanter's aren't needed in groups for buffs. A caster can simply run to PoK and get extended c3, and he's GTG for 4 hours and change. That makes chanters fairly useless in a buffing aspect in a group even for casters. Hey, you opened this can of worms when you started yapping about external buffs!<br />
<br />
Then you point out that BL mana regen buffs are the worst in the game, when in fact it is one more mana per tick than Pot9, and totally discounts paragon.<br />
<br />
Really, SD's more than Pot9 by one? Oh, i'm so bad, SD's 9 to the pot9's 8. Close enough! Talk about your splitting hairs.<br />
 You also fail to note that a BL can buff more hp's than a shaamn, and more attack.  But I am reaching by calling them a good buff class.<br />
Are we back to the &quot;more HPS and more attack&quot; thing? I'm not even addressing that, you've brought them up several times now, i've responded, you ignore my response and bring them up again like you never brought them up to begin with. Your claim that beastlords are as good... no... BETTER... a buff class as shaman is just hilarous in how ridiculous it is.<br />
Time to make you look foolish again.  Both buff.  Shaman buffs are used for stat/focus line, due to fewer buff slots used, and stacking.  BL's buff SD(remember, not everyone in a raid is pure melee), and Ferocity, and sometimes SV for those who prefer it to BSS and SoTuna.  Either you are incredibly ignorant of raiding outside your one class, or you are being outright deceptive with the above statement.<br />
<br />
Heh, I'm deceptive. Look in the mirror much?<br />
Ferocity: Good for the melee. Damn straight. Can only use on bout 3 people at once.<br />
SD. Most melee click it off as soon as they don't have room. Casters like it for its minor benefit, though.<br />
SV: Used only for melee who are interested in atk, no other class wants it.<br />
<br />
So, let me see, one buff you can only keep on a VERY small percentage of the raid, and you know what, betwseen the two OTHER buffs, they actually have ONE that's kept up on all the rest of the raid! This compared to FoS, Sta, Wrulan, Avatar, Tribunal. Oh yeah, you really did make me look foolish. Oh yes, Beastlords ARE better buffers!<br />
<br />
I have no issue with doing that.  In fact, I wish more buffs combined multiple effects, as I always have to click off unwanted buffs on raids to make room for ones I need.<br />
<br />
Heh, I'm not going to even walk in the door you opened for me. Suffice to say, you just destroyed your own argument.<br />
<br />
 <br />
Prove that I am wrong.<br />
<br />
The burden of proof is on you to prove your initial claims, not on me, because I never claimed any of that crap about wizzies and mages that you want me to show proof for. <br />
<br />
So let's see this proof of your claims. Can't or won't provide it? Going to ignore the request? Yeah, nuff said. All you can offer is rhetoric.<br />
 <br />
 The problem you have is that you  lack to see the whole icture, and look at it more from a pure melee point of view(which is kinda natural), and fail to remember that all but 3 classes in EQ use mana.<br />
<br />
No. I don't. Shamans are to a melee what enchanters are to a caster. This is an elementary statement that anyone in their 40's has learned, LET ALONE by now. Telling me I don't know these things is like telling a high schooler they don't know the difference between History and English. This conversation has revolved around a lot of what shamans bring to a group, and the tone is set by their abilities, which are melee centric.<br />
I've said it before, and i'll say it again. Shamans don't bring any more or any less to the table than enchanters, bards, or beastlords do. They just bring DIFFERENT things to the table.<br />
<br />
You play your trump card about how the other three classes can bring mana regen to the table, while the shaman cannot? Here's MY trump card. Shamans are the only ones that bring significant party healing to the table, the others don't. Note beastlords have chloro by 65, but that's insigificant in the PoP age, where mobs hit for that or more in a single hit. Still, I suppose, it must be mentioned... they're the only ones that bring crappy mana regen AND crappy heals to the table. The other 2 bring significant amounts of mana regen, but they have NO healing abilities, either. See? shamans DON'T bring anything more or less to the table. They just bring DIFFERENT things.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here's a mental exercise for you:<br />
<br />
Try to make a viable group using only INT casters.  You've got SK, bard, necro, wizard, enchanter, mage.<br />
<br />
It's doable, but I think it'd have to be either charm-based or a kiting group, i.e. situational and quite possibly poorly-optimized.<br />
<br />
Try to make a viable group using only pure melee.  Um... no, not working.<br />
<br />
Now try to make a viable group using only WIS casters.  You've got pally, beastlord, ranger, cleric, druid, and shaman.  Cha-ching: this one works well.<br />
<br />
Conclusion: WIS casters are relatively versatile and powerful.<br />
<br />
Here's another mental exercise:  Consider the primary group roles.  Tank, healer, crowd controller, haster, slower, damage dealer, and for unconventional groups, kiter.<br />
<br />
Tank is the least vital role; in an xp group, it's perfectly possible and sometimes preferable to replace a tank with a slower or a kiter.<br />
<br />
Healer?  WIS casters of all sorts, and particularly priests, are obviously teh w1nz0rz.<br />
<br />
Crowd controller?  Bard/chanter is optimal - but any of the priest classes are a decent option.  Clerics are third best CC through Pacification, Root, Stun, and Atone; Druids fourth best through Harmony, Root, and snare kiting; Shamans fifth with root, slow, and ignore.<br />
<br />
Haster?  Shamans and beastlords are as good as enchanters  or bards for most xp groups.  Slower?  Nod to the shm/bl again.<br />
<br />
Damage dealer?  The priest classes are all decent at this (clerics confined to undead really) - although only ranger, beastlord and druid in a charm-enabled location like Ruj are really notable.<br />
<br />
Kiter?  Druids and rangers are the masters.<br />
<br />
Yeah, I don't think any of the WIS casters have any real cause for complaint about game balance at the moment.<br />
<br />
I feel for shamans to a certain extent.  Shamans were gods before PoP - a level 60 shaman is considerably more powerful than a level 60 anything else.  PoP brought them down from the top of the tree somewhere into the middle, and provided for beastlords to march far into shaman territory, costing shamans a great deal of uniqueness.<br />
<br />
But still - I'd far rather be a shaman in today's game than a monk, and I can't help thinking that there are still more urgent class balance considerations than the plight of the shammy.</div></div><hr />

Shamans are well balanced and versatile characters. I don't see them as needing any real upgrade, upgrade them and you'll screw the delicate balance we have, IMO.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm sorry your shaman can't solo fucking Time gods.  They're not supposed to, nor is every fucking class in this game supposed to be the best at everything they do, and yet we have people from every one of those classes coming here and crying because they're not.  It's fucking stupid.  This isn't the goddamned druid's grove.  <br />
<br />
Shamans are the best augment to a melee group in the game right now, and always have been.  They can provide anyone with between 544 and 844 HP, which trails only the clerics and the paladins, they have the best debuffs in the game, can contribute DPS on most mobs via nukes or high damage fast DoT's, they have a REALLY fucking nice pet compared to what they had at 55, and with the right AA's, their ability at healing anyone other than the main tank is second to none, as well as providing basically every possible utility buff in the game.  Shamans could use an upgrade?  Please explain how you can justify giving them an upgrade when there are no other classes in the game that have that level of ability.<br />
<br />
Shamans are fine.  I realize most of you group with level 63 shamans with no AA points, who's best buff is fucking strength of the diaku, but those shaman are not who we need to base class balance off of.</div></div><hr />

Even the shaman board was saying that all of those upgrades would be overpowered, and they only want a small bit.  Not one person was fucking mentioning anything overpowered.<br />
<br />
And I don't group with gimp shamans.  I duo often with a damn good shaman.  But what is wrong with an aa group heal, that both other priests and fucking beastlords get.  And a slightly higher direct heal, cause if slow bounces a few times on a decent hitting mob, they can't keep up a tank.  Though a cleric and druid can keep up without slow on the same mob.  Not easy on the mana, but at least everyone lives at the end.<br />
A bst can buff more pure hps and more stamina than a shaman, that sounds fucked up to me.  That also puts bsts as the ones who trail only behind clerics and paladins.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You realize that Druid's direct heal is only 1750 HP versus 1300 HP on Tnargs?  So this mob that you somehow can't keep up with Tnarg's it's no problem for a Druid using a 1750 HP heal?  Or are you talking about their 3k/5k CHs?  But that's 10 second casting time and you will never use those anyway because it makes more sense to take those time to try to slow something instead of doing a 10 second heal.</div></div><hr />

Only BL's can deal with the punishment the way a Shaman can - it means your slower isn't gonna fold like a carboard table the first time it gets hit. Take taunt away from their pet and I doubt BL's tank better than a Shaman, either <br />
<br />
That is quite silly. I dont suppose stonestance helps out the bst who tanks through a slow or anything, along with having more defensive skills and higher caps on them. Or the fact that a bard has higher skill caps and far more defensive abilities than a shaman, and the ability to go deftdance as needed, or jesus, run around in a circle while recasting slow, or mez it or etc and so on. Not that a bard would pull aggro with requiem of time anyway. <br />
<br />
Ah, well, I guess I will concede that a shaman can 'tank' a mob better than an enchanter with their superior skills and mitigation, discounting the runes which I look at as just an extension of their hp basically.<br />
<br />
Saying a shaman is the best at tanking through slow aggro is just  false. A bard would be 1st with their ability to entirely avoid damage by running while recasting and more likely never getting aggro in the first place, with beastlords second. Or in terms of actually tanking the aggrod mob, the beastlord wins. I see no basis on how a shaman could even be compared versus those two to become (some would argue the best!!11) as you say.<br />
<br />
As for classes having their abilities handed out to others..<br />
<br />
Berserkers only get nearly every warrior disc duplicated, our AA's and improve on our 'unique' ability to go into a berserker frenzy as well as obtaining crippling blows. F them.<br />
<br />
The differance between a warrior and berserker? Warriors get to wear plate and have defensive. Berserkers get everything else and then some.<br />
<br />
I still find the entire concept of the class just retarded beyond belief. Could have saved alot of time and made the game much more fun by adding the few 'perks' of berserkers to the warrior class. The ability to go into a berserker frenzy at will, and rally cries, along with some melee based utlity skills (which we still may get who knows, we should) while still having dps lower than a monk (as berserkers are slated to be) would not be unbalancing.</div></div><hr />

Also their slow is hardest to resist by far because Malos has virtually no aggro.  I suppose as a bard you could do Harmony of Sound and then Requiem of Time but most Bards don't seem to have HoS memmed for XP groups from what I can see.  It is very rare for a Shaman to be tanking an unslowed mob even if they draw aggro since Malos exists.  On the other hand an Enchanter will get aggro if they try to tash first (at least with most Warriors).</div></div><hr />

I will admit fault there.  Though druids are getting a slightly faster, slightly more hp direct heal.  The main spell I thought that could use some work is just a higher 10 second cast heal.  More in line with a priest than a hybrid.<br />
<br />
As for BSS over SV, some may choose SV even if brells is availabe for the added attack, it's not necessarily a better spell overall.<br />
<br />
But then again, a pally can buff slightly more hps than a cleric, guess my ideals of a parent being better than their hybrid on some of their most important aspects isn't common anymore.<br />

Not worth arguing, if they just nerfed bsts away from overpowered I'd be happy.</div></div><hr />

Bsts can buff more hps than shamans.  Bsts and chanters do more dps than a shaman can with dots (especially with a warrior tank, since most dots are very high aggro).  And bsts buff more atk.  <br />
<br />
This is from a while back in this post...<br />
<br />
But, Shamans get IoS and Talisman, you know, those spells that let a beastlord buff more hp than a shaman...well, a shaman gets those spells at level 49....yea, level 49.<br />
<br />
More ATK?  I dont think so.<br />
<br />
Ferine Avatar:140<br />
Bih'Li:20<br />
<br />
That makes 160ATK in 2 spells.<br />
<br />
Sure, you might get a bit more ATK with Ferocity and SV....but Ferocity is 650 mana...and takes an emerald iirc...not going to be cast all that often, where avatar would be cast all the time.<br />
<br />
Lets take Ferocity vs Avatar:<br />
<br />
Ferocity is 600 mana for 6.5 mins<br />
Avatar is 350 mana for 6.5 mins<br />
<br />
Avatar recast time is 1 minute<br />
Ferocity recast time is 2 minutes<br />
<br />
Lets take a group, with a BL, Warrior, and other melee.  Now lets imagine a BL &quot;Adding more ATK&quot; to that group.<br />
<br />
First, the BL will have to recast Ferocity nearly the INSTANT it refreshes, since its 6.5 minute duration, and 2 minute recast...more than 3 melee....someone isnt getting it.<br />
<br />
Now, lets look at mana cost.<br />
<br />
600 mana every 2 minutes, no specialization checks.<br />
300 mana/min just to keep it up.<br />
<br />
Now, lets look at BL mana regen.<br />
<br />
KEI+FT15 (for the sake of argument, most BL's wont have FT15), MC3 and SD = 41 mana/tick<br />
<br />
41x10=410 mana/min<br />
<br />
That means, a BL would use almost 75% of his mana JUST to keep Ferocity on 3 people...and is UNABLE to do it on more than that.<br />
<br />
Now, lets look at Avatar.<br />
<br />
350 mana, 1 minute recast<br />
<br />
Due to duration and recast, a shaman can keep it on an entire group.<br />
<br />
Now, lets look at mana cost.<br />
<br />
350 mana every 2 mins for 3 people.<br />
Thats 175 mana/minute. Specialization check takes it down to 155.<br />
<br />
Now, lets look at shaman mana regen<br />
<br />
KEI+FT15+MC3+Can4/5 at 50% utilization (ie being cast at a rate 50% of what a shaman can max them at...I CAN back these numbers up if needed) = 14+15+3+ ~50 = 82, add 50% medding rate and you have ~100 mana/tick regen.<br />
<br />
So a shaman uses LESS THAN TWO TICKS of mana to keep Ferine Avatar on 3 people, CAN keep in on the whole group, and would use LESS THAN 40% of his mana keeping it on a WHOLE GROUP....and this is with the shaman NOT USING CANNI TO ITS FULL POTENTIAL...<br />
<br />
Add in the fact that more shamans have SCM3 and SCR+M and EE4 or better than BL do (or can, not sure), and Ferine Avatar is lasting 12 minutes, and costing 10% less mana than mentioned above.  I don't think that either of those AA's is anywhere near as high on a BL's list as on a shamans.<br />
<br />
The ONLY thing a BL can do better than a shaman is TANK and GROUP DPS.<br />
<br />
Raid DPS? No.  Check out what a shaman can do with the top DoTs.  Now aggro and death associated with such DoT dps is another matter.  I routinely out-damage BL's on large, high-hp targets...in places like Ssra, its not even a contest.<br />
<br />
Group DPS? BL win on this one.<br />
<br />
Heal? No, haha.<br />
<br />
Slow? No, 65% is a long way from 75%.  Malo(s) &gt; All when slowing as well...I don't EVER get resisted on exp mobs...ever.<br />
<br />
Buff? No, see above.<br />
<br />
Debuff? Cripple + Malo(s) win here. Nods to the Shaman.<br />
<br />
CC? I dont see root anywhere in the BL spellbook.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall, I don't really see BL's as a threat to Shaman's at all.  There is a BIG difference in what a class CAN do, and what happens in reality.  Sure, a BL CAN buff more ATK and 60 more HP, and slow a mob 65%...but it takes WAY more buff slots, too much mana, and mobs resist slow when not tashed/maloed quite a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Doomflayer</div><div class="date">01-31-2004, 11:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have seen BL try to slow in an LDoN adventure for us, resists were near 40% mark.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mystaviant</div><div class="date">01-31-2004, 12:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok.  Beastlords do NOT compete with a shaman in groups.  Bards don't either.  Both bards and BL go very very well with a shaman, especially the bard.<br />
<br />
Basically it comes down to enchanters being the most competition for group slots with shaman.<br />
<br />
First, the DPS issue:<br />
<br />
Charm SUCKS for DPS.  It's incredibly dangerous, a bad charm break means a group wipe, as a hasted pet is going to do far more DPS than  ANY cleric could heal against.  Also, don't forget that the MORE DPS the pet does, the LESS EXP the group gets.<br />
<br />
As for spell DPS, I can guarentee that given only 2 spell slots, a Shaman can do far more DPS in a group than a chanter.  Velium Strike + Bane = very respectible DPS from a class that was invited to the group in the first place for a reason OTHER than DPS.<br />
<br />
No one is going to go &quot;Get a slower&quot; then think, 'Get a chanter slower, they are better DPS&quot;.  No, they are going to get a chanter over a shaman for ONE reason, MEZ.  If there is little or not chance of adds, or there is room to kite, snare, and root-slow-park the adds, then the shaman is going to get the nod.<br />
<br />
<br />
Right now, melee classes are very weak compared to caster classes.  Consequently, a lot of groups have just a tank and casters, or maybe a tank and 1 melee dps... but almost never more than 1 tank.<br />
<br />
Shamans were the champs in kunark....consequently, melee classes rocked back then.  I was in quite a few groups in kunark and up to just after luclin (when the caster upgrades started to be utilized, as not everyone had kei the day luclin was released), that had a healer of some sort, and the rest were melee.  Did you need mez? No, just keep the mobs off the healer, and you are ok, everyone was a tank.  Screw mezzing them.<br />
<br />
Once melee classes get a boost, and they will, whether it be from higher caps on skills, or faster weapons, or new skills, or anything else the devs come up with, shamans will be king again.  When we start seeing groups that consist of a healer and slower and the rest are melee, who do you think is going to be more wanted, a melee-friendly slower, or a caster-friendly slower?  Exactly, the shaman will.<br />
<br />
Add endurance regen buffs, AoE slow (great for melee heavy multi-pulls) and heals and Quiesence to help keep the tanks standing, plus health regen and haste and you have a good group.<br />
<br />
Hopefully, melee will get the boost they need soon, because shaman sure dont need it (but make our pets dual-weild when cast for the love of GoD).  Add a few zones with low-hitting, Mez-Immune, social, Lull-Immune mobs, and all of a sudden, melee-oriented groups are popular again.  PoP would remain as is, so the other classes wont get left in the dark for exp groups, as well.<br />
<br />
Sorry for the rant, but I am just getting sick of lull-pulling LDoN groups, caster heavy groups wanting a chanter slower, so when their robe wearin ass gets owned, they dont have to get their crack fix before returning to the group, and people going on about other classes slowing &quot;as good&quot; or &quot;good enough&quot; or buffing &quot;better&quot; than a shaman.<br />
<br />
PS: Just an additional thought on the whole &quot;bl adding more atk&quot; thing... <br />
<br />
Sure, you 'might' get 40 more ATK with a BL, which adds maybe 4DPS...<br />
<br />
but with a shaman you get 10% more haste. <br />
<br />
Lets say you have the shittiest dps imaginable for a 65+AA melee class....maybe 70DPS<br />
<br />
10% of 70 is 7...or twice the DPS boost from the extra 40ATK.<br />
<br />
Plus, 10% more haste scales linearly with your dps, the extra ATK pretty much remains fixed at adding a few DPS, no matter what.</div></div><hr />

Besides it simply wouldn't be efficient.  Why take 10 seconds to cast say a Shaman CH for 4K when you could try to slow again in that time unless the mob is plain unslowable?  <br />
<br />
As for melee vs caster DPS, you'll be surprised how much more damage melees do than casters in long settings.  4 melees + clerics + slower (Bard/Enc/Sham) is always the most damaging combination you can get for LDoN for example (ignoring charm).</div></div><hr />

As much as all of us complain about 125 HP ALL/ALL items, you guys seem to forget that 500 HP buff that is ALL/ALL too.<br />
<br />
In a game &quot;powered&quot; by magic effects, any class that has a near infinite well of mana is possibly too powerful.  Shamans are slightly over powered because of the combination of Cani/Quint.  If they only had one or the other it wouldn't be so horrific.  Ce la vie I guess.</div></div><hr />
