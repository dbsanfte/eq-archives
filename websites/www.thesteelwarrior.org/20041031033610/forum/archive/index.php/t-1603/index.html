<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>DinadassDegladi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I need an equipment check, we just entered NToV and i don't have means to 100k+ in plat for ornate (stupid shammy bot's spells)<br />
<br />
I have the lvl 6 charm so i sit at about 4970hp unlike what my magelo says. I think i need new shoulders and bracers, ac sta/hp is all that matters i have FA all the time.<br />
<br />
I'm not on chardok faction yet, but may switch for spirit wacked cords, i have the OS drop for them in my bank, how hard would the switch/finishing the quest be?<br />

thanks for any advice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Smakz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">step #1 ... Chestplate of Vindication, or Breastplate of Eradication.<br />
<br />
step #2 ... Boots of the storm, Fierce Heraldic, or Vindi boots.<br />
<br />
Step #3 ... you said NToV ... you can kill Dagarn, thats obvious ... so, Greaves of the Deep Sea (Lord Koi, easiest kill in North), or FH, Cloak of Thorns from Lady N, or Cloak of the Fearsome, from Cazic (the god).  Also, look into replacing your arms, helm, and bracers with Warlords (BoBs are nice, but warlords have more raw HP, and AC, and they still have some stam on em).  Mask of the Sky from Eashen, Ring of the Sky from Eashen<br />
<br />
and thats about all i can think of off the top of my head.<br />
<br />
GSoT should hold you till EB or better (even though i despise the weapon, i cant ignore the fact its a great aggro generator)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>kriegartorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">seeing as ur a RZ barb... hook urself up with FH... its dirt cheap (well at least on my server)<br />
