Well if those 2 things above apply to you &amp; you either got into elemental planes in the last week or 2 or plan to in the future, youre already used to being turned around &amp; bent over so I wont have to explain anything else to you!</div></div><hr />

The Vergog ring went off without a hitch, status quo pretty much, never had a problem with it. The Dust Ring however....<br />
<br />
Adding a trigger was nice, we popped trigger and started clearing the Devotees, only to find out that the last 2 on track were stuck under the world/in the wall pretty much behind and sorta under the raid, not in the temple. We did manage to target and kill them, which resulted in the next wave of junk that attacked us and promptly went under the world to take the place of the missing Devotees, this must be a hotspot for Earth mobs, cause they all wanted to go down there...<br />
<br />
Managing to kill them, we did end up going on to drop the Warder and finish the ring. This event was somewhat smoother, but still needs some work..</div></div><hr />

For the first time that I can remember since January, the birds where left up on ptach day.<br />
<br />
SoE did exactly what they intended, these are going to be much harder than before. They did need retuning though, most of the PoF minis where 3 group fights at this point. I like the changes so far, should make the fights a lot more fun.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are you one of those people that killed AoW the first time with your guild all level 60 and little to no AA?  Are you one of those people who actually attempted events without knowing beforehand what to expect or even how to trigger them due to spoilers?  Are you one of the ones that tried for weeks on end to get earth and air events to spawn, only to find out that they are broken and only spawn once per patch, never respawning?  Are you one of the ones that actually had to figure out where to go and what to kill to progress in PoP without following a pre-made kill order on some spoilers site?  Are you one of the ones that cleared Vex Thall when mobs cast an unresistable AE blind?<br />
<br />
(sarcasm)Yes, the game is soooo unfairly biased towards those who are pioneers(/sarcasm)<br />
<br />
Fact is, the game gets easier and easier as a whole as time goes by.  Believe it or not, those guilds who pioneered to be first at things, constantly put in a ton of work into the game to stay on top. THe pioneers get bent over by beta testing things far more than you do when you come to a mostly balanced encounter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gallerus</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 01:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah youre right...<br />
<br />
(sarcasm)Fact is, the game gets easier and easier as a whole as time goes by.(/sarcasm)<br />
<br />
and making aes virtually unresistable &amp; extending their ranges from 100-&gt;300 is testament to things being easier!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solinar</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 02:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, but the theory that those who pioneer the game have it so much easier than everyone else, is frankly, completely false.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gallerus</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 02:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm talking about the unfairness of people getting to farm, for months &amp; months, mobs that are now significantly harder than they were previously.  This much is painfully obvious just from looking at the aes on lucy.  Hersay infomation includes shaman saying that some of these mobs are immune to slow were they mitigated slow before, increased meele &amp; increased hps are also being reported.<br />
<br />
So now after months of running around flagging people, with more competition than the so called &quot;pioneers&quot; (the pioneers who benefit from pre nerfed drop rates + who get increased access to mobs due to less competition), those just entering elemental planes have to suffer with needing 50+ people raids to farm mobs that were killed previously with half those numbers.  <br />
<br />
Your gonna tell me someone at soe just woke up 6 months after people started killing these mobs &amp; decided &quot;gee these need to be orders of magnitude harder than they are &amp; now is the time cause the 'pioneers' have been justly rewarded for their efforts&quot; ?<br />
<br />
History has shown that soe cant test or balance the content they create.  It would be nice if they would stop punishing people for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solinar</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 03:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm talking about the unfairness of people getting to farm, for months &amp; months, mobs that are now significantly harder than they were previously.<br />
<br />
Somethings are tougher, some things are easier. Should there not be balance?<br />
<br />
Air and Earth are now significantly easier than before.<br />
<br />
The first guilds in the planes dealt with:<br />
1) Bugged rings in earth and air<br />
2) Lack of Raid Flagging (having to do a full reflagging every fooking returned guildmember or recruit your guild needed)<br />
3) Screwed up pathing that was recently fixed.<br />
<br />
Even with the upgrades, guilds coming into the elemental planes now have it easier than those who were there first.<br />
<br />
You think that guilds were in the planes would not have cleared minis at the exact same rate they did?  Most people bring 45-60 to clear minis, because thats how many in their guild raid every night. Some minis could be done with 25, but after taking 60+ to kill Rallos Zek, how many guilds ditched those members and started raiding with 25?<br />
<br />
Anyone who can kill RZ can kill any mini in Fire or Water still.  I dont understand what exactly you think the guilds that killed these mobs when they were easier got that you wont get.  The mobs will still be killed just as they would have had they been upgraded the day the planes were entered.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 03:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">not all guilds read spoilers to assume that just wrong besides ONLY pioneers are far and few in-between most uber guilds leach info off one another on encounters and pharming most of the time made so so much easier for them. in most cases<br />
<br />
Warders<br />
Vulak<br />
nuking Seru to death without any hindarance<br />
Also come to mind</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 03:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Spoilers are basically stuff you learn on your first attempt (how hard he hits, what kind of spells land, what his AE is, etc.  Rarely is a real strat available in a spoiler, and even if it is, you still have to adapt it to your guild.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Pioneer&quot; guilds get to try mobs uncontested as many times as they need to to figure them out, where second tier guilds have to race more experienced, better geared guilds for every mob they get, and usually only get one shot if they do manage to win the race.<br />
<br />
Given the choice between having unlimited, uncontested tries at a mob and having to race a guild that has already mastered the mob with the help of a spoiler, I'd pick being the &quot;pioneer&quot; every time.  Also, even the &quot;pioneer&quot; guilds get spoilers.  If you listen to most uber guilds learning an encounter you will here things like &quot;this is how Afterlife does it&quot; all the time.  It may not be on Allakazam's but it's in the &quot;top sekrit leet monk/rog/whatever channel&quot;.<br />
<br />
Then when you're done waiting for the #1 guild to finish farming loot for their alts and let you have a shot at it, VI makes the mobs harder (ie Cazic Thule, Sleepers, Vulak, and now Fire minis).  After being in a 2nd tier guild for years and now watching my RL friends play in a &quot;pioneer&quot; guild I can tell you that being the top-tier guild is the place to be.  They may whine about their progress being blocked by VI occaisionally, but guilds behind them have had their progress blocked by the top dog guild on pretty much every mob that they have ever killed.  <br />
<br />
Top Tier uber guilds have an easier life than the ones following them.  They don't stay the #1 guild year after year because they are so damn good.  Some guilds are really exceptional, most of them got on top by luck or hard work years ago and stay there because they are able to keep the other guilds behind them down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spinetwist</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 03:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Im absolutely shocked at the revamp. The mobs used to be steady, but they have boosted the HP so significantly that the named Fire mobs are now holding a challenge. Two days ago  we did Magmaton and it was a breeze. Last night we wiped 3 times and had to give up because it got too late. The loot didnt change so Im pretty upset about this. Ive been busting my ass getting AA's and up until last night I was able to Tank some of the big guys. Now that the mobs have been given a boost Ive been knocked back down to my worthless tank status. <br />
<br />
This pisses me off to no end, and the only reason I can think of why SOE did this was to further delay plane progression due to their own incompetence with Plane of Time. <br />
<br />
Im running and running to catch up and it just seems that when I get to see the finish line, SOE puts the finish line further away. It's nuts.<br />
<br />
Anyway. Yes the mobs are incredibly tougher and I feel very sorry for those people trying to get their foot in the door.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spinetwist</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 03:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As for balance arguements, the mobs are caked in HP, fights last 3 times as long, aoe's are further radius.<br />
<br />
I dont see any balance in the equation. And those Earth rings were busted so arguing that's balance doesnt hold any water with me. SOE should have had that worked out before they launched PoP, instead of trying to stop gamers from progressing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gallerus</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 04:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You think that guilds were in the planes would not have cleared minis at the exact same rate they did?

Some minis could be done with 25, but after taking 60+ to kill Rallos Zek, how many guilds ditched those members and started raiding with 25? <br />
<br />
I dunno about other guilds, but my guild is spread out over like the whole world (literally).  Our top dps people all seem to be east coast, clerics mostly midwest &amp; west coast, our top 4 warriors are east coast, midwest, west coast &amp; aussie, etc.  Throw in half of them are in college, a quarter are single &amp; another quarter married &amp; you got people logging in &amp; out constantly.  We get about a 5-6 hour window everyday with our whole raid force online where we can hit mobs like bert, mm, etc.  After hours we get 25ish people running through solro tower killing minis &amp; stuff there.<br />
<br />
I do /wh all elemental_guild_01 on my server &amp; I see EXACTLY the same thing going on - they are full out raiding at the same time we are...except at 2am when we are in solro with 25, they are (were) in pof/pow/etc farming up armor &amp; loots with 25.<br />
<br />
So basically this nerf is going to impact the speed at which I acquire the same loot, cause now instead of having my guild farming the stuff like 8 hours a day with a partial raid force the whole time, we will be limited to a much smaller window when everyone is on - thus it will take twice as long to farm up the same gear (and thats before you take the extra competition into account.).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spinetwist</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 04:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This change is great for all the uber guilds since it will prevent the rapid advancement of rival guilds, this is why the pimp guilds are so happy SOE did this. Loot isnt a big issue since they have been farming the planes for months now, so who wouldnt be glad to see the supply cut off to enemies? The uber guilds also seem to be excited because the upgrades will offer new challenges. <br />
<br />
This change is positive for people who are Plane Veterans, and Sony - since preventing progression of planes will give SOE time to fix all their busted crap, and veteran guilds will have less competiton.<br />
<br />
Im still mad at this change. Seems like I will need another 85 AA's and 750hp before I can tank these improved mobs, and by that time they will have revamped mobs or some stupid crap again.<br />
<br />
Yeah I might be whining, but I havent been in EQ as long as some veterans and Im sick of being screwed around.</div></div><hr />

These mobs were too easy.<br />
<br />
It doesn't matter who got to farm it for however long, it was still too easy.  It's good to see a company find a problem and fix it.  There are many, many more rvr related issues that need to be fixed, maybe they will start tackling them next.<br />
<br />
Once again, the mobs were too easy for the loot they gave.  Now we just need them to move molds to HoT-style trash mobs and design real loot tables for the minis.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You continue to think that, and you will continue to not be the top guild on your server because of that attitude.<br />
<br />
Its alot easier to say that guilds are intentionally kept a cut above other guilds because verant for some reason wants it that way, than it is to decide that maybe the top guilds really put in more work to get where they are than you did and buckle down and try to get better.<br />
<br />
My guild was not always the top guild on our server, but I plan on pushing them to stay on top now that we are.  And for the record we havent cockblocked a single mob in PoP, not one.<br />
<br />
I wont be posting back here, to close to flames for me, and thats something my guild does not like its members to partake in.<br />
<br />
Each person has a right to their own opinion, and the right to display it here. I wouldnt begrudge you that right :)</div></div><hr />

as for &quot;AoW the first time with your guild all level 60 and little to no AA&quot;<br />

<br />
Of course these mobs are'nt going to be a challenge if you have been in Elementals for 4 months.<br />
<br />
I guess my anger is coming from a wrong perspective. I should be pissed off at the group of 5 people with charmed pets doing mobs like Pyronis - cuz ultimately people who find an easy way out ending up screwing everyone.</div></div><hr />

I did both of these things.  I had no elemental loot prior to doing so.  That, my friend, is far too easy.  Fire and Water should have taken WEEKS to complete.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Should I walk into Plane of Fire and clear it on the second day I raided there?<br />
Yup, us too. Other than Blazzax, the rest of the minis where a joke after the first couple of tries. The other 2 elemental guilds on my server did the same thing, minis dead the day they set foot in tier 4.<br />
<br />
They didn't change the spawn time, they didn't change the loot - farming will continue, now it will just be a little more fun.  Seriously, anyone who doesn't think this is a good thing either never fought the PoF/PoW minis or they are not thinking straight. The night before the patch we killed Criare Sunmane with 16, straight smackdown, no charmed mob BS. That is way too easy, elemental bosses should never be that easy no matter how long you have been there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raaj</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 08:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The change is good, the fights are a lot more fun now. They're actually *gasp* exciting! The loot farm was getting really old.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Parv</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 09:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hah, this change really hurts my guild more than the other elemental guilds on my server.  We would regularly do Fire and Water named with a skeleton crew in the early afternoon or late late at night, which let us kill a lot more named than the others.  Now we're going to have to field normal raid numbers to kill a lot of them, the same that other guilds had to do since the beginning, which cuts down on the amount of pre- and post-raiding hours ganking.<br />
<br />
Anyway &lt;3 changes. <br />
<br />
AoW the first time with your guild all level 60 and little to no AA<br />
You youngin's with your 10 or less minute AoW fight.  I remember when AoW was a solid 40 minutes of fighting with 80 people in mostly Kunark and Growth level gear, and Deputy Buda was the only way to tank him :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
-Sony is doing this, to delay EQ from dying, cause as soon as plane of time comes into play, people will be at their cap , at their best gear possible, then theres nothing else to do.<br />
<br />
-Now they just need to nerf tier 4 crafted items drop rates, to people have to exp longer to get them, or either make their success rates worst. <br />
<br />
-Next thing you know,they make all minis 5 day spawns!</div></div><hr />

IF THAT HAPPENS YOUR DEAD !  :)<br />
<br />
<br />
I do agree that the minis in fire &amp; water were easy.<br />
But the loot was crapastic. Killing mobs for rotting leather is lame.<br />
<br />
Please make some more creative loot tables.<br />
Killing 6 7 magmaton praying for a Necklace and seeing<br />
Leather x2 , Silk Leather, Leather Silk, is just lame.<br />
<br />
If you want to boost up named, sure np but :<br />
<br />
1) FIX THE FOOKING ARMOR DROP RATES  (aka more plate/silk plz)<br />
<br />
2) Make some MORE CREATIVE LOOT TABLES (awesome job on earth revamp)<br />
<br />
3) FIX THE FOOKING RESISTS -400 ? gimme a break<br />
4) FIX THE FOOKING RANGES 300+ ? gimme a break<br />
<br />
WHY THE FUCK ARE THERE RESIST BUFFS AND FOCUS ITEMS ?<br />
(hey lets make it so that the best effect in the game is<br />
totally useless VS trash, and usable only for Fenin &amp; Xenogy)<br />
(I wont even comment the resist change)<br />
<br />
Doubling DoT strength &amp; mob melee = great idea.<br />
<br />
Make Focus &amp; Resist MATTER, we are back to gimp zerg sontalak again :<br />
ZERG ATTACK and hope he dies before the AE eat us.<br />
Thats LAME</div></div><hr />

They were all fun fights. More fun than a lot of us have had in EQ in a long time. They are sufficiently strong. Now, they need to revamp the loot tables. 2 drops of rotting leather and silk is a joke. 3 drops, including real items (not elemental) would be more in line, with a chance for a fourth drop (ie, how gods can have 2 items+legs...have minis with 1 item, 1 item/armor, and an armor with a chance for a fourth.).</div></div><hr />

<br />
 HOWEVER! Making everything unresistable was stupid. In conjunction with no AE blocking and 300 range anyways. just a dumb combo to make resists absolutely pointless.<br />
<br />
 And I'm still waiting for links to the hundreds of posts from people who were calling for these changes months ago. Not after farming this stuff for 4+ months, but after a few weeks. And not &quot;they're easy teehee&quot; but &quot;they're too easy and need changed&quot;. About 9 days ago a big outcry started for them to get made harder. No idea what triggered it directly but that's when it started. And all the bullshit claims about &quot;I always thought it was too easy, this is great!&quot; mean jackshit if you just happily farmed the easy versions for months.<br />
<br />
 Blah, summary: Changes needed. Poorly tested. Resists are supposed to matter. Poor bards.<br />
<br />
 Oh yeah, keep in mind all the people 0wnzoring them now are already chock full 'o' ele gear. 9500+hp 1900+ac makes em a lil bit easier methinks. And you didn't get to that point by farming tier 1-3.</div></div><hr />

I don't mind mega-range AE so you get stuck in it, but at least give us a chance to resist it. Either remove the 500 hardcap or drop the resist mods to something around 250-300.</div></div><hr />

<br />
WRONG!<br />
<br />
Sure all the &quot;gods&quot; will have been disposed of but what of the Great Crystalline Dragon?  What about the ultimate Planes of Veeshan or Planes of Dragons?  What guild doesn't want to take on the big V?  Veeshan must be destroyed!  (Unless they put Veeshan in the Plane of Time.  Did they?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zotha</div><div class="date">05-03-2003, 01:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The mobs arent all that bad. Speaking from the standpoint of a guild who came along well after FOH and has been farming molds for a few months off these mobs (with alot of competition), they WERE too easy, espescially Hydrotha, Krziik, Pyronis, AM and Babnoxis. Blazzax was fine in his old form, though the new version isnt much different all up. The only really stupid change was making Ofossaa so much harder. Changing either his hp, AE range or resists would have tuned the encounter to be reasonably difficult. Changing all 3 was way overkill. Killing this absolute monster for a mage dagger and some leather boots seems quite retarded.<br />
 <br />
That being said what I do disagree with is doing such changes without fixing the mobs loot tables in the same process. These mobs should be dropping real loot, with molds as the afterthought. Coming from a server with 6 guilds sharing the elemental planes I can say that there is NOT enough mobs dropping enough loot to go around. There should either be more spawns (there is room enough in Water for another 6 named or more, they could easily add static mold droppers in earth A) or these mobs should be dropping 3 items (preferably with more real loot added to droptables with molds as an afterthought).</div></div><hr />

They need to change the AE on the Arch Mage to a curse and he will be fine. His AE atm just promotes zerging. You can *try* to dispell it off your casters, but we ran into problems tonight. The problem was that some people just couldn't dispell the AE on themselves or anyone else. We had everyone (besides the enchanters) using the exact same dispell. There were also people complaining that radiant was just sucking for the most part to get rid of it.<br />
<br />
The Generals are very much overpowered. I don't enjoy sitting here basing my tanking abilities on pure luck. That's a total crock of shit. One of them proc'd 3k dmg on me 3 times in a row with a 500 FR. Speaking of resist, we killed both generals and I resisted, partially or fully, a total of 0 procs. This was with 500 FR with over 9 mins worth of pure tanking.<br />

Some mobs they did ok with, but others they screwed.</div></div><hr />
