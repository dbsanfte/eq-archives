Yeppers... and if it don't turn the mob (this is exp group grind) then I hit my SHIELD macro<br />
<br />
/assist<br />
/shield<br />
<br />
Then re target mob<br />

Rarely rarely rarely do I have problems with agro for more then the refresh of a taunt button.</div></div><hr />

As a rule, I only hit it when I lose aggro coz if I'm mashing it and I lose aggro I may have to wait a couple of seconds for it to pop back up.<br />
<br />
This is bad when the mob is bashing on caster_01, and also means I may have to run after the mob, also bad.<br />

<br />
I don't know if it's something I'm doing wrong or not. But I can't seem to gain any sort of aggro lock when grouped with those two. Any ideas? click my Magelo and you can see my set up (the bottom bag on the left side has my alternate weapons)...<br />
<br />
However, when I'm in a group where I can gain aggro lock, I tend to taunt constantly for until the mob gets to about 95-90 % health and then begin to space the taunts out. I normally cease taunting at about 50-60%, depending on group and such.</div></div><hr />

To keep aggro :)  <br />
<br />
You shouldnt use it that way.<br />
<br />
Taunt should ONLY be used/pressed WHEN you lose aggro.  You dont gain additional aggro everytime you use it.  Taunt puts you on top of the hate list +X number.  Everytime you use it, I think it refreshes that hate list.  Thus you should only use if you lose.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">07-02-2003, 02:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well then shouldn't you be gaining X agro every time you successfully taunt?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lorre</div><div class="date">07-02-2003, 02:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">X is a tiny amount.  By taunting you refresh that list.  Say you have +300 hate points above anyone else on a mob via procs and damage.  When you hit taunt, it recycles that list and adds +X for you.  So you ended up losing that [300 - X] amount of hate.  I think thats how taunt works.<br />
<br />
That means that you should only use it if someone has more hate points than you.  That way you get to the top of the list + X</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ygnir</div><div class="date">07-02-2003, 02:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Let's just say that there are taunt mashers and non-taunt mashers, you either do the one, or the other, whatever works for you. Commanding people to do either one or the other because it's 'obviously' better is silly to the extreme, since not a single shred of evidence supports either theory.  If you're in doubt of doinjg the right thing.. just try the other method for a few days and see how it feels.. experiment.. be your own judge :)<br />
<br />
<br />
My personal thought:<br />
<br />
Waiting for me to lose aggro only insures that someone else is going to get hit. Having a fresh taunt button at that time means nothing to me, taunt may well fail and i'll still lose the mob. By taunting whenever I can, I assure myself of a higher % of succesful taunts and keep myself no1 on the hate list... since I am in effect constantly piggy-backing of my group member's aggro. The gap between me and any other partymember will therefor be generally smaller and can in some cases even be filled by pure DPS on my side... (i.e mob starts to turn for druid, steps one step in direction of druid and turns back me)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Noone knows what the &quot;X&quot; is, however, and hitting it when you already have aggro gives diminishing returns as compared to hitting it when someone else accidentally pulls aggro.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, if that little bit of &quot;X&quot; value keeps you on top if you keep spamming it, then by all means go for it.<br />
<br />
I personally am of the mindset that it is better to keep aggro than lose it every once in a while. My usage of the taunt button is situational. If someone is ganking aggro quite a bit, ill save the taunt button until then. If the only thing turning a mobs head on someone is pure DPS, then I would hit the taunt button when it pops. This changed some when i got an EB weapon.<br />

<br />
Because X~1<br />
<br />
Let me elaborate.<br />
<br />
Let’s say, because it is easy to think in round numbers, that you generate 100 points of hate every 3 seconds. (  Mind you this is an outrageous number to just pull out of my ass and in actuality the number would probably be much smaller)<br />
<br />
You can taunt once every six seconds. Also for the hell of it, lets be generous and assume that taunt generates 50 hate when it works ( ~50% of the time on blues )<br />
<br />
So you whack a mob for 6 seconds and taunt the mob successfully and you have 250 hate.<br />
<br />
That sounds nice?<br />
<br />
No.<br />
<br />
Spells generate 300, 400, 500, 600+ hate  per cast.<br />
<br />
Not good~<br />
<br />
That means if someone casts one of the huge hate spells they are going to get their asses handed to them. ( BTW the huge hate spells tend to be the ones you want to have cast on a mob, such as slow and other de-buffs. ) Let’s say slow has 600 aggro.<br />
<br />
Now then :<br />
<br />
So now you have 250 hate and the slower has 600 and is getting eaten alive after just six seconds with the mob.<br />
<br />
You cannot taunt for another 6 seconds and only generate 100 hate every three seconds so...<br />
<br />
6 seconds:<br />
You have 250 hate slower has 600. Slower is being eaten<br />
<br />
After 9 seconds:<br />
You have 350 hate. Mob is still eating slower.<br />
<br />
After 12 seconds:<br />
You have 450 hate. Taunt fails ( 50% and you lost the roll ) mob is still eating the slower.<br />
<br />
after 15 seconds: <br />
You have 550 hate. The poor slower is still getting chewed on despite the heal that was tossed on them.<br />
<br />
After 18 seconds: <br />
You now have 650 hate Vs the slowers 600 woot! Problem is the slower is now suffering from low hit point aggro and the mob finishes them off.<br />
<br />
( The average caster will not live that long against a pop mob fyi )<br />
<br />
Now then lets save taunt till the slower slows. Best case:<br />
<br />
6 seconds: <br />
You have 200 hate, the slower is getting eaten cause they have 600.<br />
<br />
You taunt and make the roll: You have 650 hate the slower has 600 and all is good in the world.<br />
<br />
Mind you: you can still fail the first taunt but a 50% chance right off the bat is far better than having to wait 6 seconds before getting the same.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
DISCLAIMER:<br />
<br />
These are not the exact numbers. And any numbers will vary from mob to mob depending on the mob and/or zone that said mob is in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ealsur Helevorn</div><div class="date">07-02-2003, 03:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Great explained post Varaho :D<br />
<br />
I was just gonna add myself to the &quot;I press it when I lose agro&quot; crowd. The only moment I lose agro to the caster is on the incoming slow or malo (debuff... or whatever is called, I leave magiks for finger wigglers), or if the wizzy might get a round of 3 2k+ crits on a round, and I taunt just to be sure.<br />
<br />
Mob is incoming, slower casts, slow lands, mob turns his eye on slower, and the moment he turns his eye and he is not even half way to the slower, you taunt and voila! the mob never touched the slower, in case taunt fails, you /shield and wait for a refresh. But I press it inmediately when I see the mob turning, no matter who is he turning to (if its not me :p) I press it, but never if I have the agro. I find it much more eficient than smashing it all the time, I used to smash it till I was like lvl45-50.<br />
<br />
The problem with other meeles and agro its kinda different, procs and occasional taunts help with that, like when rogue gets a couple of backstabs in and the mob turns, or before ranger jolts, you taunt and the gap is bigger.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sargman</div><div class="date">07-02-2003, 03:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Really the only issue I have with taunt is when I'm in situations where I'm grouped or raiding with a person who has a bug up their rear with me (or at least it seems) and they are intentionally trying to steal agro...or someone who has no ability to control their agro (which I still see far too much at lvl 65). <br />
<br />
 Other than that agro is pretty easy to maintain once you get it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dintorr</div><div class="date">07-02-2003, 04:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I used to be a Taunt masher ...<br />
<br />
Then I read a nice long thread (on the old board, not sure if it made it to this new board or not) on how taunt works.  I thought it was quite enlightening.<br />
<br />
Since then I have only mashed taunt whenever I lose aggro.  I have found this method to be very effective.  This ensures that if, for whatever reason, I lose aggro that the taunt button will be ready for me to use it.  Quite frequently I am able to get the mob turned back around onto me before it has even taken 2 steps and had a chance to hit the person doing the slowing.  There are many fights where I have not had to hit the taunt button a single time, but that is more due to the skill of the group and the luck of the RNG I'm sure.<br />
<br />
In fact, using this technique I have been told by several people that they are amazed at how well I hold aggro.  Emberassingly enough, I was once told by a Pally in the group that he was going to make me an un-official Pally because of my aggro holding skills.  :eek:<br />
<br />
People who constantly mash the taunt button do not have this advantage.  In fact, because taunt mashers lose the critical ability to effectively time their taunts, I would call them bad Tanks.  Perhaps taunt mashers are one reason Warriors have such a bad reputation as aggro holders.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">07-02-2003, 04:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Taunt button usage (http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showMessage?topicID=2691.topic) <br />
<br />
When I was about level 55, I began to realize there was an awefull lot I did not know about being a warrior.  Had the old message board pointed out to me, and the number one thread at the time was the one linked above.  I discovered that I had misunderstood taunt for 55 levels, and was devestated.  How dumb could I be?  I had always thought taunt added a certain amount of hate, so every time the button refreshed, I pushed it.<br />
<br />
After reading that thread, I started just taunting as I lost agro.  I was amazed.  My job got tons easier.  As I went along, I started timing taunts more...watching for the important cast messages, and taunting immedietly after.  My job got even better.  <br />
<br />
Based on my experiences, I can say that button mashing is the wrong way, timing taunts, and saving it for after loosing agro is the best way.<br />
<br />
BTW, I would like to thank everyone who posted in that old thread, and pointed out the right way, and guided me on the path to becoming at least some what competent.  If not for you all, I would have given up on Redhenna long ago, and that would have been just sad.</div></div><hr />

If ENCH in grp, see tash being casted - wait for tash msg (hope it dont out aggro if it does taunt/shield) wait for slow being casted - see slow land hit taunt and pray for a good RNG weee Im so far up on the hate list I usualy hold aggro from there to eternity,(this is without weapon procs also)<br />
during the fight see a CH cast wait for it to land Taunt again Yay top o the hate again. Taunt is a tool like any other and playing with it can cause blindness 8)~<br />
<br />
I have seen a large persentage of aggro control with the last taunt patch, but before and after that using control and not mashing has given me far more control over aggro.<br />
<br />
disclaimer.. SoE's RNG is = loaded dice. wheres the bouncer casino guards?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lorre</div><div class="date">07-02-2003, 04:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I got a question. <br />
<br />
If you are WAAY at the top of the list (say +1000 above everyone else) and you hit taunt, what happens?<br />
<br />
a) You add that X amount ontop of 1000 (so 1000 + X hate)<br />
<br />
b) You reset your hate value so you're on top + X? (only + X hate)<br />
<br />
Anyone have any ideas or answers?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Graal the Dorf</div><div class="date">07-02-2003, 10:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">since not a single shred of evidence supports either theory. <br />
<br />
(sigh)<br />
<br />
Wrong.<br />
<br />
Think of taunt as a yes or no. <br />
<br />
Do I currently have aggro? If not I will taunt. Did taunt succeed? Yes. I now have aggro.<br />
<br />
Don't think of taunt as adding x amount of hate, taunt gets you aggro. If you already have aggro and taunt, congrats, you just taunted the mob off of yourself. You added a miniscule amount of hate and greyed out your taunt button for 6? seconds.<br />
<br />
Yes | No</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">07-02-2003, 11:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ex-masher here aswell.<br />
<br />
Now mashing taunt just means that if someone pulls agro off me it will be up to an additional 5 secs before I can have an attempt at taunting the mob back.  Enchanters can die in that time, so can wizards (tho dead enchanter = bad, dead wizard = lesson in agro management :p )<br />
<br />
When I XP I find that the portion of the fight up until the mob is debuffed and beating on me is crucial, and during this stage I have to have taunt available to press for when debuffs land.  Once the mob is debuffed and agro is established on me I could press or not press but at this stage I usually find I dont need to press taunt again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dakkin</div><div class="date">07-03-2003, 06:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">90% of the time you use taunt to get aggro back when you've lost it, or when you think there's a very high chance you've lost it and don't want to take the risk.  This is about the only way I've used it myself.<br />
<br />
BUT Redhenna's linking the previous thread reminded me of Frodlin's excellent post there, which gave me pause for thought when I first saw it (and especially now when AE taunt is available for real emergencies).<br />
<br />
Can anyone who's done a fair amount of both mashing and timed taunts on raids comment on this?  I'd be interested to see what people think who've used both approaches:<br />
<br />
Posted by Frodlin:<br />
<br />
I'm not only in Thorbadin's &quot;Mash during raids where there's the potential for high aggro at long distances&quot; camp, I'd take it a step further and say that ping pong is more likely, and aggro re-establishment is *less* likely by taking a &quot;taunt when you lose aggro&quot; approach, making yourself a danger to your raid by simply being stubborn because &quot;you know how taunt works&quot;.<br />
<br />
Please note: This ONLY refers to raiding scenarios when there's fairly large numbers of people engaging a LOT of high aggro behaviour from a distance. It does NOT refer to experience groups, more melee oriented raids, or anything else whuch doesn't involve high distance aggro.<br />
<br />
1. It is absolutely proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that one can be highest on a mob's aggro list and not be getting beaten upon because of distance. Don't believe me? Go get yourself on top of a mob's hate list with 10 mother melees around and try to move the mob. You CANT DO IT by yourself unless it's immediately post-summon.<br />
<br />
2. IF you are the main tank and are NOT highest on the mob's hate list, but are the highest among those within &quot;aggro proximity&quot;, then a successful taunt ABSOLUTELY adds numeric hate to you, it places you above those higher than you yet far enough away to avoid engagement.<br />
<br />
3. Every time you press the taunt button, it does NOT guarantee a successful taunt.<br />
<br />
4. The more times you press it, the more likely it is to be successful once.<br />
<br />
5. If someone exceeds the range/aggro quotient, the mob WILL move, particularly post summonning placing everyone nearby in danger of either AE's or Melee damage.<br />
<br />
6. It is MUCH harder to re-establish lost aggro than it is to maintain a position on top of the aggro list.<br />
<br />
7. It is also MUCH less likely that a mob will be in taunt range for your convenience if he runs halfway across a zone to pound on a mage or wizard, leading to the possibility of wasting your chance to taunt because of range issues.<br />
<br />
8. If you think that you're on top of the mob's aggro list simply because he's beating on you, explain that to the wizards who get summonned while you're getting beaten upon. <br />
<br />
9. If you had the opportunity to place yourself higher on a mob's aggro list and avoided that opportunity, out of stubbornness then you're a jackass.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sargman</div><div class="date">07-03-2003, 10:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with the statements made, especially with PoP these days, because in the off chance that the MT dies, it can be a pita for the second tank in line to establish enough hate quick enough even with AET because of the fools who aren't paying attention and helping the new MT gain sufficient agro. Too often you watch (especially rogues) others get turned on and wiped out quickly because they're generally afk (which is why I think they play rogues just to afk a lot and feel more needed during a CR). More often than not, that few seconds can be the difference between a success and a failure on a raid. <br />
<br />
 Generally I try to make sure I'm 2nd behind the MT on the hate list, in case he does die, it makes for a smoother transition. Something our SK's have been working on more of late is agro transfer as well, as they're more likely to grab 1 mob when pulling compared to monks sometimes pulling 2 or 3 inadvertently, and with the SK, the hate is on them 100% on pull, they are able to transfer agro more cleanly, and if need be based on how the mob hits, they can DA themselves for the pull.<br />
<br />
 Amusingly enough, taunt at this point is working I think the best it ever has since the low levels when everything agro'd you and you didn't need to do much to maintain agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ygnir</div><div class="date">07-03-2003, 12:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you already have aggro and taunt, congrats, you just taunted the mob off of yourself.

<br />
Maybe you are all doing groups where you are the the only one hitting the mob ?<br />
<br />
In my groups I generally have a shaman, druid and sk, all blasting full power, no holds barred.  The chance that a succesfull taunt is succesful on 'my' aggro listing (i.e I taunt myself) is far smaller then my taunt overtaking the constant stream of aggro generated by these other players. I adventure mostly in PoP with hard hitting mofo's, often with 2+ mobs in camp,  no chanter, just a nice collection of mobs, toons,  packs of dogs and screenspamming from my hammer-girl. To suggest I could afford to watch a mob turn for someone else before pressing taunt ( and then praying that it works ) is kinda funny... it just doesn't work. Maybe it works in a single pulling , one-mob-inc, we-have-a-nice-safe-camp-here situation... but frankly speaking... that's for sissies and monks. Let me mash my button, slam my beer, and be happy as can be, without all the bullshit about warriors not being able to hold aggro other people use to excuse themselfs from the fighting floor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now to the meat of the matter:<br />
<br />
To suggest I could afford to watch a mob turn for someone else before pressing taunt ( and then praying that it works ) is kinda funny... it just doesn't work<br />
<br />
You can't  afford it, however mashing will make them die just the same. Rather catch 22 eh?<br />
<br />
Now I am going to say a rather &quot;DUH&quot; statement, but people still can't get it into their heads.<br />
<br />
You have no way of keeping the other people in your group from outaggroing you. Mashing taunt won't: they will still out aggro your ass then get beat on. Saving taunt won't: They will still outaggro you and get their ass beat on.<br />
<br />
The only difference is how long you have to wait until you have the chance to get aggro back from them.<br />
<br />
<br />
It doesn't bother me if you like to let your group to get beat on for 6 more seconds than the people that save taunt, you are only hurting your group.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Amen Bro.  Like I said earlier, I think it's taunt mashers who mainly give Warriors a bad name in aggro holding.  Well, that and groups that don't work with the Warrior on aggro management.<br />
<br />
What's the phrase ... &quot;Any fool can taunt off a Warrior, but only a fool would do so.&quot;<br />
<br />
To suggest I could afford to watch a mob turn for someone else before pressing taunt ( and then praying that it works ) is kinda funny... it just doesn't work. <br />
<br />
Oddly enough, this is what I do and it works great for me, even on PoV mobs and I'm only a level 61 Warrior.<br />
<br />
Maybe you should try timing your taunts ... I think you'll be surprised at how effective it can be once you get the timing down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Buun Sofsteel</div><div class="date">07-03-2003, 06:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am much more effective using taunt when necessary and following high aggro debuffs/slows.  I think it is widely agreed that a succesful taunt gets you barely above the next person on the hate list ~ someone mentioned a number like Top of list + X (and perhaps X is a very small number like 1).<br />
<br />
I would like to present you with this thought...<br />
<br />
A SUCCESFUL TAUNT MAY LOWER YOUR AGGRO.<br />
<br />
Here is how and why mashing should be avoided.<br />
<br />
example scenario only using a chanter and a war (ignoring all other classes as if they do not come into play atm):<br />
<br />
Mob is pulled...  <br />
War engages with attack, kick and a successful taunt...  <br />
He is building aggro and has the mob...<br />
Tash hits (mob stays on war but enchanter is just barely below the war on the hate list now)...<br />
Couple more combat rounds...<br />
Slow hits (Enchanter has now risen above the war and mob changes targets)...<br />
War succesfully taunts and gets aggro back...<br />
War is now at Top + X and continues fighting...<br />
War has risen above Top + X with a proc and his additional damage...<br />
CHAIN MASHER HITS SUCCESSFUL TAUNT AGAIN... <br />
WAR NOW DROPS TO TOP + X (ie loses the additional aggro he has built in relation to the chanter during the rounds since his last succesful taunt... <br />
Chanter cripples and moves well ahead of war on aggro list and is again beat down...<br />
<br />
Had the war not taunted prior to the Cripple he would have had enough extra hate in there to have maintained control after the cripple but because he is a masher he actually lowered(removed) his excess hate and the Chanter is thinking (Damn, we need a Pally).<br />
<br />
Now, apply that to any point in combat with any group makeup.  Imagine if at the beginning of that scenario where he had built enough beginning aggro to overcome the tash but had taunted JUST BEFORE the tash hit??!!  Well, he would have lost aggro on the tash right off the bat...<br />
<br />
Hmm, just my thoughts on the matter.  Bottomline is I have become an effective aggro tank now by making sure I only taunt when necessary and using a high aggro 2 hander.<br />

If you are at the top of the aggro list already, it may or may not add a tiny bit of aggro.  It would make no sense to lower you on the aggro list to the same as the 2nd highest person.  It's not really possible to test this, but I don't believe taunting could lower your aggro.  If it could it would be the stupidest thing in history and the opposite of the intent of the taunt button.<br />
<br />
Ygnir please lay off the &quot;in my groups we go hard and I can't afford to wait for a mob to turn like you noobs&quot; crap.  A lot of us have been in PoP experience groups.  It's no different than anywhere else.<br />

Think there are a whole lot of NEW warriors out there.  And a lot of them are getting to the high lvl's pretty darn fast.  Anyways, they might be fairly new to the class and threads like these should be helping them improve their class ability.  That and also debunking some old myths they might have heard about taunt, etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its not funny at all, its your duty to watch that.<br />
<br />
What if you taunted 2 secs before the mob turns? The mob turns and you have to wait 4 seconds before taunting again.... and pray that it works anyways... but if you wait till the mob turns, you can taunt the second it turns, not wait up to 5 secs to do it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Maybe you are all doing groups where you are the the only one hitting the mob ? <br />
<br />
No, I often group with a 62 ranger, and they can easily steal agro.<br />
<br />
And you know what Ygnir, it works even better on multiple mob situations, why? Lets say you have 2 parked adds and 1 mob you are tanking, you have the agro on this mob and the rooter has the agro of the other 2 parked adds. You and your mob are away to avoid getting smacked unnecesarely (sp?) but, the closest rooted mob to you brakes root, and starts to go to caster, you can actually switch the mob, taunt and go back to your mob, now you have 2 on you, wait for root and proceed to move your first one. Its not really hard and there are more chances of you having your taunt available if you dont smash it, that if you do...<br />
<br />
But again, Varaho said it really well on his posts</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thulikore</div><div class="date">07-04-2003, 01:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">/agree Varaho 100%<br />
<br />
Every test that I've conducted myself matches precisely with what he posted. <br />
<br />
That said, some of what Frodlin mentioned I agree with as well. In a raid situation where dozens of folks are poised to pull agro off of you at once, it can, at times, be beneficial to chain Taunt, at least until you're confident that you've amassed a nice amount of agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GSW</div><div class="date">07-04-2003, 03:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How does the amount of hate on the other person change the chances of taunt working? For example, if you have build some aggro and slow lands, you can taunt and get back on the top. But if an SK has cast a load of aggro spells and you taunt, there is no way you will get aggro back. Or maybe there were 2 mobs and no chanty and they can't be rooted. The shaman slows the mob you're on, you taunt to get back on top. Shaman slows the other mob, now if you taunt the other mob it will most likely stay on the shaman, you'll have to throw some damage, procs, or more taunts at the mob to get it back on you.<br />
<br />
Of course, about taunt actually adding a fixed ammount of aggro...Well, how could it add aggro if you could stand next to a non KoS mob taunting it and it won't do a thing about it? Of course, AE taunt is different. I just got AE taunt a few days ago, and our group was just getting ready to go kill stuff when the zonein was trained. So, there's 2 mobs, i AE taunt them, they get on me. Problem is, there was a non KoS mob there which reacted to my AE taunt by jumping on my head and smacking me a few times, so i had to zone. If i did a regular taunt on it, it would not have aggroed. So, is AE taunt sorta like a area effect EB? <br />
<br />
Oh, and about using AE taunt...is it best to just throw it in right away when there is adds, or should i wait for the add to get slowed and then AE taunt to get the add back on me?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, it just does  work.  To do it otherwise, after having how taunt works explained to you, just makes you a bad warrior.<br />
<br />
Let me mash my button, slam my beer, and be happy as can be, without all the bullshit about warriors not being able to hold aggro other people use to excuse themselfs from the fighting floor. <br />
<br />
People who mash buttons help add to the perception that warriors are unsafe to group with.  Bad warriors make good casters leary of grouping with the rest of us(the same why some bad enchanters have made me dread seeing them as primary slower).  <br />
<br />
How does the amount of hate on the other person change the chances of taunt working? <br />
<br />
Anecdotally, I would say that it seems that the difference in hate between you and the person highest on the hate list does affect the chance of taunt success.  It seems that way.<br />
<br />
So, is AE taunt sorta like a area effect EB?  <br />
<br />
Area affect 100 % top of hate list(frenzy agro excluded).  The area is not terribly large, but yes, you can agro non-KoS stuff with it.  I have several times agroed casters horses with it as well.  Thankfully, they are pretty gimp.<br />
<br />
Oh, and about using AE taunt...is it best to just throw it in right away when there is adds, or should i wait for the add to get slowed and then AE taunt to get the add back on me? <br />
<br />
I watch health bars when using AE taunt myself.  A lot of times, casters can sort the problem out well, without you needing to blow AE taunt(root, mez, etc).  I mostly use AE taunt when a caster hits 50 % health, or if it is a chanter, as soon as they start taking actual damage, meening the mob has ate thru theeir rune.  I am not 100 % sure that is the best way, but it does seem to work.</div></div><hr />

I dont have proofs, but from my experience and from diving in on mobs that were at 50% and starting to taunt, that it took like 3 or 4 taunts to get em on me off the previous tank, and that is much more times than it takes when Im taking and I lose agro due to the slow, when it only takes 1 taunt oftenly.<br />

Completely and totally wrong.<br />
<br />
Taunt is a ( yes | no ) and is based completely on your taunt skill, your level relative to the mob's level, and the RNG. It doesn't matter how much of a hate lead the other person has at all. <br />
<br />
What you are seeing is the fact that when someone has a smaller hate lead, it is easier to regain aggro by bridging the hate gap with melee when that hate gap is smaller.<br />

Ever seen a freshly rezzed tank come in and get aggro with 1 taunt on a mob that has been engaged for 15 minutes?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have in fact done that.  I also know that is is far less likely to do that than to successfully taunt off a lower agro differential.  I am not saying that agro difference in fact makes a difference, but I do know that it does in fact seem that way.  Have any tests been done to prove that a difference in amount of agro has no affect on the likelyhood of taunt success?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your experiences seem to match mine.  Whenever there is a large aggro differential it generally seems to take more presses of the taunt key to get aggro than if I already had aggro and the mob had just turned onto the slower or debuffer.<br />
<br />
I don't know the formula used to determine taunt success (of course), but it doesn't seem unreasonable that there is some component in it that takes into account the aggro difference in determining success / failure.</div></div><hr />

<br />
from my experience<br />
<br />
Im not saying it works like this, its just that, like many other said, it seems harder to taunt a mob after it was engaged by another tank for some time and there is a substancial agro gap between him and you. Of course that with meeling, this gap starts to be smaller (hence why it might be easier getting agro with taunt as rounds of meele passes).<br />
I know Taunt is a yes | no, and that is based on my skill and my lvl and the RNG, but can you say for sure those are the only factors that work on the % of success? Its just my opinion that a big gap in agro might affect this chance of success, and it comes from experience, you have other experience and have other opinion, but you didnt code the game and you cant say Im totally wrong.<br />
<br />
And no, I've never seen a warrior fresh rezzed come and engage a mob after 15min and gain agro with the first taunt.</div></div><hr />

Can you either post your test results(with an explanation of just exactly what the test was), or link to them please?  I understand how speaking mobs can be used to test succesfull taunt, but just saying 'mobs that speak'  tells all of us nothing.  If you have done a test on taunt success rates for varying agro differentials, I would love to see the results.</div></div><hr />

If by testing you mean taunting mobs that have different ammounts of aggro from other people, i think all warriors do that as part of their job. I'm posting about this because i've done it many times myself and it is very hard to get a mob off someone with lots of aggro. Please explain how mobs that speak made it possible to see that ammount of aggro has no effect on taunt.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Find a non KOS mob that speaks. Have the paladin or cleric chain stun said mob over and over...and over again. They don't have attack turned on. Now without attacking, go up and try to taunt the mob. The very first time you get a taunt success message, the mob will turn on you. Once you have a success, memblur. Repeat. Find your average success rate on taunt. Notice, by the way, that you can (and do) have successes on the very first taunt.<br />
<br />
Same mob. Without anyone else aggroing the mob, taunt until you get the success message (and aggro). Memblur, repeat. Find your average success rate on taunt.<br />

Compare success rates.<br />

Taunt is a known quantity. We, the playerbase, have known exactly how it works for a long, long time. Feel free to run the tests yourself. It is conceivable that SOE (or Verant...it's been that long) could have completely changed the basic nature of the Taunt skill without everyone noticing. But I don't think so.</div></div><hr />

I find that I am quite often forced to mash it constantly as I commonly group with an epic'd rogue and epic'd monk and they tend to steal aggro if I don't consta-taunt. :/<br />
 <br />
<br />
It is up to the rogue, monk, and ranger to manage their own aggro.  Each of these classes has the ability to drop themselves down the hate list.  I play one of those epic'd rogues, and as soon as I see the whites of a mobs eyes, I mash evade.  If the melee gets killed because they drew aggro and did not drop it, then let them die, maybe they will learn someday.<br />
<br />
As for Sargman who wrote<br />
Too often you watch (especially rogues) others get turned on and wiped out quickly because they're generally afk (which is why I think they play rogues just to afk a lot and feel more needed during a CR). <br />
