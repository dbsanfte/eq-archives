In a recent message from smedley or whoever the hell it was , they said something very close to &quot;melee have fallen behind thier casting counterparts at the end game&quot; , please dont quote me but it was very similar to that.<br />
<br />
 So since then , they have/are going to : expanded the manapool by 50% , upgraded the mage pet , upgraded the necro pet<br />

The 52 fire pet was useless, so it was upgraded to be on par with the other pets, but not to be on par with a level 50 wizard hehe.  I don't really think this is a major upgrade for mages.  They certainly don't need one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">05-18-2003, 08:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">But Brutul, where's the little matchstick keep all his snowballs?<br />

Surely it's more like SLUSH COMET when coming from someone as hot tempered as the oft maligned mage FIRE pet?<br />

cause without us. every ranger would die... not saying thats a bad thing. but then they would have to rant some more.........</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GSW</div><div class="date">05-18-2003, 10:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, it matters. If you gave Harm Touch to necros, SKs would feel like you'd taken some specialness away from them. If you raised druidic tracking caps to ranger levels, rangers would feel like something special was taken away from them. If you gave all plate tanks Defensive disc, warriors would feel like something special was taken away from them. <br />
This was in the thread on the wizzy boards...I was reading them with some apathy, not really caring much about this stuff. Until i get to the last part of that paragraph. At that point i jumped up in my seat and stared at the screen. Good thing there was an &quot;IF&quot; there, or i would run after that guy and kick him so hard...heh. Anyway, i don't really see this as a bad thing...62 pet casting a 52 wizzy spell once in a while and spending half its mana on it is not that bad...i think...only problem is that it's ice based. Basically, what Supercham said :)</div></div><hr />

Right now, I think of it like this - at least they are looking at problems instead of sitting on their ass counting their money.  If they continue with this path, they should get to us soon.<br />
<br />
As for group buffs not sticking on lower chars on test, I thought KEI didn't even have a limit as is?  Some spells do, yes, but I thought KEI didn't.  Could be wrong though.  They also might be adding one, who knows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Apothes Drudoll</div><div class="date">05-19-2003, 11:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kei Does have a limit I have a 60 chanter. just about all 50+ spells have a level limit. (there may be a few that do not) but to my knowledge all have a level limit. but the group ones you could use MGB or group with a low level to get the buff to stick on them. not anymore. on test anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jecht</div><div class="date">05-19-2003, 11:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree that warriors need changed.  I don't believe the class is nearly as useful as other classes, but alot of people don't sound like they have ever played a mage or a necro.  These were the 2 MOST USELESS CLASSES IN EQ until they started fixing them.  Most of the upgrades to these classes is pretty recent and I think that currently the mage class is still pretty useless.  Necros are sitting pretty nice but mages still suck.  Mebbe worse off than us warriors is the mage.  If you have played EQ for a while you will notice a trend.  A few classes will be overpowered, and a few will be underpowered and this will shift and change with every new expansion.  Like someone said, at least they are fixing things and I'm pretty sure that eventually warriors will get the upgrades they deserve to make them an actually balanced class instead of what they are now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bloodslake</div><div class="date">05-19-2003, 12:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As a 55 mage on Innoruuk I can tell you this upgrade was needed.  Actually mages need more work than warriors.  No one likes mages in groups.  Imagine how many mages would even be in guilds if not for CoTH....LOL - exactly.<br />
<br />
I love playing my warrior.  Yes, tweeks are needed.   Someone wrote this should be encouraging - SOE is listening and making an attempt to make the game better - more fun.<br />
<br />
Hell, I may even start playing the mage again from time to time.<br />
<br />
Course I should be doing my 3500 kills in Droga to become ally with Sarnaks.....to help others get decent epics.<br />
<br />
Then there is the mage epic...which sucks....sorry getting started on mage shortcomings - wrong board.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaldanm</div><div class="date">05-19-2003, 12:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Iagree the class need some tweaking, but no more than warriors need. Of course if you're a mage you may be biaised, as I am for warriors :).<br />
<br />
Mage and necros, most useless classes ?<br />
 humm dont think so. Every time I grouped with a necro, fights were easier, shorter. The can group-tap hp, stats, mana... they can solo any add with no prob, your healer is never oom, they are wonderful damage dealers with dot stacking (assuming the mob you fight last 1 min :p).<br />
I have played a mage too, they can do wonderful stuff. Fabulous damage with spells, combined with light melee damage from pets, summoning tons of stuff (arrows, focus items, resist gear, people, beer)... If you think your mage is &quot;underpowered&quot;, stop playing him. Best group I ever had was war (me) / druid /mage/mage/mage/mage.<br />
<br />
Most useless class... there is none. The useless class is the one you do not know to play.<br />
<br />
By the way, those pets are great. now you may take them out of your page 50.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">05-19-2003, 12:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello?  Mages are the best damage dealers in the game right now, especially at the high end.  I duo a warrior and a cleric, and if I get to pick one person to add to my group, I will pick a mage every time.  Backstabbing pet, nukes, damage shields.  Picking up a mage more than doubles my exp, and I don't have to heal the mage or do anything except turn mobs so the pet can BS.  Mages own.<br />
<br />
The mage epic sucks?  I hope you're talking about the quest.  The pet doesn't suck at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">05-19-2003, 01:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mages are very powerful, and underappreciated imo, but the fire pet itself was all but worthless comparatively.  An upgrade to that was needed.  I personally love mages though, like Brutul said, they are amazing damage dealers, and very useful to groups.  There's a reason I got a mage twink =).  All this does is change the way they do their damage on certain occasions.  So they have pets for high ac / ae'ing mobs.  Hopefully the pet AI will be smart enough to hang back while nuking to avoid ae's.  As for the epic, who else can summon their epic at will and right click it for an amazing pet? =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">05-19-2003, 01:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A fully buffed and hasted mage pet has around 7k hps and does close to 100 dps(that's JUST the pet, add on nukes and Damage Shields to that).  Anybody know any level 60+ warriors that have less than that?  I do, a lot of them.  Mages do not need an upgrade.  Not being able to solo in Tier 2 PoP doesn't make you underpowered.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">05-19-2003, 02:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This change isn't an upgrade to the mage class.  Right now, mages use either water, earth, or air pets.  With this change, sometimes they will use fire instead.  All this does is make fire pets a possible choice.  If they use water, earth, or air, there is absolutely no change.  As for the hps and dps, which pet are you talking about?  Each type has a different amount of hps, and has different abilities.  Fire pets have the lowest hps of all, they also do the least melee damage, they are designed to be a caster, and before this the spells they cast made them not worth using.  It also has to med.  This doesn't overpower mages, this gives them the 4th choice they were supposed to have all along.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Binnamar</div><div class="date">05-19-2003, 03:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I love having mage pets in my group... their stunning pets (bleh can't remember which one it is air?) help me keep agro by keeping it stunned so I don't chase it after a slow or something.<br />

However, they seem to have been getting along just fine with only the 3 pets to choose from.  I grant that having 4 choices is better than 3 and if all this does is give that to them, then well and good.<br />
<br />
My question still is, why do casters need/rate continued improvements/fixes/upgrades while Warriors get ignored, again?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">05-19-2003, 04:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For the record, I wasn't disagreeing with the fire pet upgrade.  All 4 pets should be similar quality and in at least some situations every pet should be the best choice.<br />
<br />
I was just disagreeing with Jecht and Bloodslake saying that mages suck.  They don't.  In fact mages are pretty damn nice now.  Their only real complaint is that they can't solo in PoP like they have been able to in the past.  Personally, I think PoP was the &quot;group&quot; expansion, and being a grouping class I like that.  They wussed out on it though, and made zones where kiting classes can solo.<br />
<br />
The numbers I posted came from a post on the Mage's compendium.  I think it was the 62 air pet but I'm not sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gallerus</div><div class="date">05-19-2003, 04:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You'd have to be insane or stupid to say mages suck these days.  There arent many classes that can easily burst in excess of 300 dps + still have sustained 100+ dps.  /pet hold pretty much eliminated any problems with pet control, so there are very few times mages cant use pets now (high damage aes still = bad though).  Mages are freaking machines in situations like bert ring where you gotta kill mob after mob after mob for 2 hours.<br />
<br />
EQ isnt the same as it was when velious was 1st released when every mob was like immune to non lure spells.<br />
<br />
edit: btw pre-rok, mages owned everyone so hard it wasnt even funny - lvl 49 earth pets tanked way better than lvl 50 warriors &amp; did way more damage than anyone else &amp; not by a small margin.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You guys are painting mages to be the end all to end all, they are not. Mages pre 58 are worthless. Mod rods? worthless, thanks C3<br />
<br />
COTH? rarely used anymore<br />
<br />
big raids? hi enjoy sitting on your ass and doing nothing because your DS is overwritten by druids.<br />
<br />
Malosi, no good others can do that<br />
<br />
Sure, its all fine and dandy for the mages you guys are talking about that have epic pets or are above level 60, but pre 60, we are unwelcomed and useless.<br />
<br />
No one even wants our focus items that Verant gave us to supposedly make us more wanted. Now those things have been rendered useless by items with better focus effects.<br />
<br />
SO dont make all mages out to be UBER fun, cause its a rough and under appreciated class</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">05-20-2003, 11:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So how does the fact that Mages suck pre-60 have anything to do with upgrading the level 65 Mage pet?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gwarf</div><div class="date">05-20-2003, 11:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">nothing, all im saying is that for a mage to be effective they need to be level 58+ and it should be noted lol<br />
<br />
just making sure they are painted with a broad brsuh as being some great class that doesnt need to be looked at.<br />
<br />
besides warriors, mages hardly ever get anything worth mentioning</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">05-20-2003, 11:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Guess what, every class sucks on raids pre-60.  If you're raiding, then you should be leveling up to 65.  You know warriors can't even taunt boss mobs until 60 right?  Useless on raids pre-58?  That's pretty much everybody.  That's why most raiding guilds have a level limit of 60+.  <br />
<br />
CoTH isn't used anymore?  Mod Rods are useless?  Whatever.<br />
<br />
Anyway, that is just utility.  Even without any of that stuff, you are still great damage dealers, which is the ONLY thing that wizards and rogs bring to a raid.  Mages just need to get over their inferiority complex and realize that they are a pretty nice class now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gwarf</div><div class="date">05-20-2003, 11:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well im not gonna argue about what I have experienced as a 55 mage, maybe 56 mod rods are more in demand but I dont ever see one single request from any of our mages answered in raid chat or group chat.<br />
<br />
I have seen level 57+ mages just no even wanted on raids period.<br />
<br />
COTH is hardly ever used except for maybe 2 raids where it may help.<br />
<br />
every single shout out by a mage if anyone wants summoned focus items, or mod rods, are simply ignored and its a good point, why bother?<br />
<br />
honestly, what guild can say they need a mage on a raid to be successfull. Before mass rods were nerfed, mages were great to have along, but thanks to a new reuse time and FT items and uber crack, mod rods arent even wanted anymore<br />
<br />
thats all im gonna say. As far as the life of a mage goes, not impressed. I think its fair to look at pre 60 mages as well as uber mages<br />
<br />
its not all cheese and wine. Some level 40 mage may come by here and get all excited and not realize he needs to spend half a year and shout for groups or sit on his ass going solo till level 60 to be effective</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">05-20-2003, 12:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Or maybe you will succeed in convincing all the warriors that read this board that mages suck and they don't want them in their groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gallerus</div><div class="date">05-20-2003, 12:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We use tons of mod rods still - they are like adding ft7 for free basically.<br />
<br />
coth hardly ever used anymore ? I wish this was the case i'm quite bored of cothing everyone with my mage - luckily now I have someone else do it ;D<br />
<br />
Regardless of both of these things, mages are the 2nd best nuking class in the game at most levels + bring pet damage as well + dshields...dont want your dshield overwritten - then level past the freaking druid.<br />
<br />
1-60 mages arent in bad shape either - they bring very good dps to exp groups regardless of level.  People like you who post on msg boards about how bad mages have it perpetuate the myth - other people read msg boards see someone say &quot;oh mages suck&quot; &amp; then decide hey - i'm not gonna group with mages - they suck!<br />
<br />
Msg board posts have a really big influence on people &amp; not always for good reasons - there are SO many times when i'm playing alts &amp; I see low level people take advice given situationally for very high end stuff &amp; try to apply it to their level 50ish xp group &amp; its just stupid.<br />
<br />
btw - I still summon a lotta focus items for people &amp; we are vt capable/rz short of elementals - id4 items, etc dont grow on trees.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gwarf</div><div class="date">05-20-2003, 12:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">LOL?<br />
<br />
no not really, any warrior that reads these forums is gonna get a negative impression about a warrior!!!!<br />
<br />
Good god you are worried about mages? I almost quit my warrior when i came here at level 30 to read some tips, the negativity is sad!<br />
<br />
I actually made a dwarf paladin and then had to slap myself<br />
<br />
Im not saying mages suck, what im saying (and this is typical of forums) is that you guys got off the subject I was adding to:<br />
<br />
dont make mages look like they are all that great when you guys are talking about UBER mages.<br />
<br />
the average mage does not have that much fun in this game before 60<br />
<br />
My mage is USELESS on raids. Period. Maybe that is because he was in an uber guild, perhaps. If he was in a guild with no mages and he was more desired, I can see that maybe he would get the love a gnome deserves :(<br />
<br />
But where he was, he was not ever ever ever needed.</div></div><hr />

Mages seem have no idea how pissed off you get when you are doing some tactical weapon swapping and then suddenly *poof* this useless crack-on-a-stick appears trying to get you to click away your hps while some mob is eating you alive. Stuff like that just makes you want to take said mod rod and beat the mage that gave you it over the head until the spell is deleted from their spell book and then shove the rod up their anus sideways as a warning in case they ever think about memming the spell agian.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gallerus</div><div class="date">05-20-2003, 01:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">heres a solution then - ask for a mod rod at the start of the raid &amp; stick it in a bag.<br />
<br />
they are lore &amp; you wont get a 2nd one on your cursor later if you have one already.<br />
<br />
we dont have this issue in my guilds cause all our tanks are too lazy to swap weapons (well unless they are in xp groups with no slower, then I see the willsapper + blue epic coming out a lot) :P</div></div><hr />

Mages are one of the best classes to have in raids or xp groups. COH is used all the time, and mod rods...I've never been in a raid or xp group where they aren't asked for.<br />
<br />
Way off topic, but if a mage is useless on a raid then they aren't being used properly. COH can assemble a raid grp in no time and avoid unnecessary crawls to pull points (been in TOV?). Further, their dps is huge...plain and simple.<br />
