<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I might be sticking at 60 for a while. so i'm wandering which AA choices should i keep away with. Cuz to me, even warcry sounds really good.</div></div><hr />

305AA done Havent found one useless yet.<br />
<br />
I would say as &quot;sub optimal AA&quot; :<br />
* Warcry<br />
* Finishing Blow<br />
* Super Finishing Blow<br />
* Bind wounds<br />
* Super Bind wounds<br />
* AE rampage<br />
* Super AE rampage<br />
* Regen<br />
* Super Regen<br />
<br />
All the other AA are worth getting, the Gain per AA isnt the same.<br />
But we dont have that many &quot;useless AA&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tim99</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">what about Double Reposte Emilia? <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Auron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have maxed double rip, and maybe i just miss it but its borderline worthless to me.  I find it rarely going off and not nearly worth the points i put into it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You forgot innate lung capacity.<br />
<br />
Any AA that can be made practically useless by Fishbone Earring ... not all that OPTIMAL in my book.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well cant parse it, dont have results ....<br />
<br />
But here is a wild guess ...<br />
<br />
But lets say you riposte 5% of your enemies attacks (single riposte every time).<br />
And that 66% of these ripostes land.<br />
<br />
0.66x0.05 x1 = 3.3% of your DPS is ripostes (using 2H weapons)<br />
<br />
(hit ratio x riposte ratio x single riposte factor)<br />
<br />
Lets say double riposte gives you a 75% chance to double ...<br />
0.66x0.05x  (0.25+2x0.75) = 5.775<br />
<br />
In theory (wild guess, no real numbers at hand) Maxing double<br />
riposte will get your riposte DPS from 3.3% to 5.57%.<br />
<br />
The increase is very small ....<br />
Like from lets say 100dps to 103-105 depending on your weapon.<br />
Maybe 106-110 with a big 2H.<br />
<br />
Its not the the AA with the best ratio Points/Gain , but i'm sure<br />
those 150-300 double ripostes using an Emp 2HS will do a lot of dmg.<br />
<br />
Ps : Double Riposte = Clearly a 2HS skill</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Innate lung capacity was THE AA to have during Lucling for a raiding guild.<br />

Ever tried to cross The Grey as a wood elf (75sta) naked and<br />

<br />
I did ... Let me tell you, wasnt pretty<br />
<br />
Plus its very helpfull when you have to loot your corpse underwater.</div></div><hr />

Uh, I guess I'm like the only person in EQ who keeps an extra EB item banked for the &quot;emergency.&quot; <br />
<br />
Then again, if you're only trying to get back to Sraa, why not just have one of the casters in your raid cast EB on you? Or a bard?<br />
<br />
SIDE NOTE: I was actually quite surprised the other day at how many people I know who A) Don't know where the entrance to Veksar is, and B) Don't have an EB item.<br />
<br />
I spent levels 48 to 51 with BOTH my monk and my warrior submerged and playing with the bloodgills. Curiosity got the best of me, I had to see what was in that tunnel.<br />
<br />
Nowadays, I try to explain to people where Veksar is ... 10 minutes later I find out that they don't have an EB item and that they're looking for the entrance at the SURFACE of the lake.<br />
<br />
It's like ... helloooooooo ... &quot;BOTTOM of the lake, means ... BOTTOM OF THE LAKE!&quot;<br />
<br />
Sorry to rant. S'just been bugging me lately. I thought enduring breath was like required utility gear to just play everquest. I mean, Kedge Keep and all.<br />
<br />
/sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Emilia is like my AA god now.  Wow, that is alot of AA's!  My related(sorta) question to you is, what path would you recomend for aa's?  I know this has been covered to death, but I am too lazy to search and find what you recommended.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If I needed to cross the Grey or go into KK for a CR, I just bought an EB potion from a vendor *shrug*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Khumak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'd give anything bindn wounds related the nod as most useless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Auron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">haha my old guild required 2 EB items, so i always had the amulet from the grey banked but being a barb i never took it out =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Hulanta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I use my bind wounds skill again!  I have had a couple of days where I did about 5 hours total solo or with a non-healing class.  Bandaging is good sometimes... was really good in Luclin when a warrior could solo really well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Yea I loved first aid back in the Luclin mushroom-soloing days.  Went through a million bandaids grinding AA in there and occaisionally used it to heal up casters while people were medding after a wipe-out.  <br />
<br />
Now that I can't solo effectively anymore and I have a cleric bot I don't think I'll be buying it again tho hehe.</div></div><hr />

Innate lung capacity was THE AA to have during Lucling for a raiding guild.<br />

<br />
:D  I run across the Grey without EB all the time, but I tried it the other day with my DE cleric and he didn't even get close.  Then I got him rezzed, looted my corpse and realized that he can't move with rez effects and had zero mana to gate or anything so he sat there 3 feet from the Ssra zone and drowned again lol.  Now he wears a lodizal shield, damn weenie casters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Khabok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I have EB necklaces for both my warrior and shaman, but since they can both hold their breath for quite a while I never bother using them for short swims. Ran out of Veksar other night and the shaman zoned to desktop. Soon as I logged him back on the next night I hear that chocking sound and his HP dropping and before I could figure out what direction the zone was I was dead. Guess that will teach me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kazzuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Frankly, With run3 you dont need EB to run across the grey to ssra, hell, I don't even get to half my bar holding my breath when I zone in....<br />
<br />
The only general ones I think are worthwhile are run3 (a must) sta and regen (but only spend 6 points total here unless you have nothing left to buy)<br />
<br />
Also, if you have to do ANY factioning work... rampage is a godsend.<br />
<br />
Other than that.. I pretty much agree to stay away from the others listed above unless you have AA to blow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Korinn_emarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Ingenuity level 1 is pretty useless imo.  I got the Gbos so I decided to train 1 level because it was cheap.. does it go off more often when you have level 2 and 3? Right now ingenuity goes off about 1 in 20.</div></div><hr />

Yea, I thought the same thing till I tried it with my DE cleric...he didn't even make it halfway without SoW hehe.  Used DA and still died 100 yards from the temple.</div></div><hr />

Not everyone can be super sexah trolls! ;) <br />

<br />
/side note.. I am not advocating not getting an EB item, yer gonna need em now and then... I just think there are better places for me to spend my AA than in innate lung capacity hehe.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>kriegartorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">i disagree with Emilia somewhat... which aa's will be benificial to you depends on how u spend ur time in game... if you dont exp a lot but do a lot of farming greens then certain aa's will be more benificial to you...<br />
<br />
regen is a aa skill to have<br />
rampage is very situational<br />
<br />
im currently regening at 35 a tick standing with out a fungi as a barb...  so like soloing stuff or when not MTing an aeing mob...<br />
<br />
rampage was a god send for farming hollowshade while doing my aid gimel earing...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Allpain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I have around 310 AAs so far and agree that I haven't done any to date that are worthless.  Yes some are better than others, but get all the offensive and deff. AAs out there. . .you will be a better tank for it.<br />
<br />
At this point I am working resists.  I have Magic maxed and have 15 or the 20 available in Fire completed (Trolls 'N Fire don't mix well).<br />
<br />
Major ones I haven't done are the Finishing Blow series, the Bandage Wound series, or the Regen series.  Main reason I haven't done these is I always have a healer and a wizzy with me so I didn't feel they were as much benefit as the resists.<br />
<br />
IMO we are one of the lucky classes because all our AA skills are of some benefit.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>aakla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">im told fear and warcry are being used in time for CT</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Grendonbb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Most useless has got to be innate lung capacity... but there aren't that many other ones that are.  Rampage is pretty useless imo, but no doubt some people would challenge that.  Also, double reposte and warcry seem to be a complete waste of time.<br />
<br />
However, I disagree that BW is a useless aa... like Brutul, I soloed FG back in the &quot;good old days&quot; and that is where I originally purchased the aa... to help me solo better.  But even now, with anizok's gauze press and trusty stack of mana batteries that I carry everywhere, I use it a lot.  It may not make a huge difference when the cleric doesn't have to heal the group after rezzing and a wipe, but it does make a little of one, and since warriors are already an incredibly limited class, I take any utility that is tossed my way.</div></div><hr />
