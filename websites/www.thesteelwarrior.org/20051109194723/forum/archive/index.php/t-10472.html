I want to create a macro to make it easy to switch between my dagger and swords/mace so I can easily...<br />
<br />
1. Stealth<br />
2. Switch to dagger  (&lt;--- macro needed here)<br />
3. Ambush<br />
4. Switch back to mace/sword (&lt;--- here too)<br />
<br />
So my question is, if it's done with a macro is it easy to make?  And secondly, is there a UI that I can download to switch weapons quickly?  Thanks~</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here is the problem: All commands in a macro exicute simultaniously so it is impossible for you to have the correct weapon in place and fire the attack. The best you can do is a weaponswitch (which can be generic, swap main hand weapon for weapon in a bag slot or off hand).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">01-30-2005, 04:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Shoudl be something along the lines of <br />
/script if(not CursorHasObject()) then  PickupInventoryItem(16);PickupContainerItem(4,10); end<br />
<br />
Couple of notes: InventoryItem 16 is main hand, InventoryItem 17 is off hand. The bags are 4, 3, 2, 1, 0 with 0 = F12, your backpack, etc. The slots in each pack are number left to right, top to bottom (just like regular english) starting with 1. So in my example PickupContinerItem(4, 10) would be the 10th slot in the far left hand bag (the one open with F8).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KermeyKhazi</div><div class="date">01-31-2005, 08:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There was a post a while back about an AddOn that allowed you to bind a key to switch weapon sets. I downloaded it and it works perfectly. I can go from dual wielding to build fast rage, then when Overpower Mortal strike etc. becomes available I hit one key and pop the Ability.  With two fast weapons and one really hard hitting slow weapon the switch virtually negates the Slow Attack speed of the 2hander I get the Overpower/MS and an Additional Big Hit from the 2hander then back to dual wield no break in attacks. Only thing to be careful of is if your packs are full and you switch from dual wield to 2hander you will end up with your offhand weapon picked up on your mouse and no where to put it.... usually scares the hell outta me when I do that. I can see where it would work great for protection build tanks to generate extra dps  by switching to 2hander to pop revenge then back to sword and board, with a good two hander like most high lvl warriors carry around you can easily add a quick 400-1000+ dmg. You don't have to take my word for it but you should at least try it out.</div></div><hr />

Check out Weapon Quick Swap on that page.  It allows you to make a macro that will toggle between two weapon sets.  The syntax, once you have the AddOn installed, is this (example):<br />
<br />
/script WeaponSwap(&quot;Tooth of Eranikus&quot;,&quot;Crest of Supremacy&quot;,&quot;Princess Theradras' Scepter&quot;,&quot;&quot;);<br />
<br />
Which would toggle between axe/shield and a 2hander.  There is also another AddOn on that page that allows you to make &quot;weapon sets&quot;, but I haven't used it.<br />

That should help.  I don't use Macros though.  My big sword generates enough aggro/rage for my tastes.</div></div><hr />
