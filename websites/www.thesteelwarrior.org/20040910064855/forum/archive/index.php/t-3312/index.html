In the past, various classes have attempted to organize an embargo on buying an announced upcoming expansion.  This is usually done after the item is announced, folks have pre-ordered, and what have you.  And, as we're still sucking hind-tit, it's been ineffective.<br />
<br />
Why don't we organize NOW, and tell SOE NOW that we will not be buying their next &quot;New, Improved, Bigger, Better, Faster, More&quot; whatever until our issues are addressed?  Be it EQ2, be it something they want to roll out in 4 months for regular EQ, whatever it is.  Let's organize and get the voice of the Pure-Melee players heard.<br />
<br />
Or am I just dreaming?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Because 99% of the people who say they're not gonna buy it are spineless wimps and are gonna buy it because they can't control their addictions.<br />
<br />
I mean hell...go look at FOHGuild.org.  Furor stated unequivocally that he wasn't gonna buy their new shit, and yet there's a brand new thread with him bitching about LDoN issues.  Even the hardasses don't have the balls to actually sit out an expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">How bout we just crown Haass the new Furor then? I'm sure he can fill the shoes of an angry person!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Pff, I know my place.  I ain't no Furor and never will be.  I can grasp simple concepts, but Furor see's problems years in advance.  He's still one of the best spokesmen for change in this game, I just think he really made a mistake being so vehement in his refusal to purchase LDoN and then caving a week later.  There is a multitude of people who do exactly the same thing and that's why a boycott is never gonna work.<br />
<br />
Plus what the hell is keeping people from saying that they didn't buy LDoN on TSW and acting tough, but secretly going anon and doing some adventures in game?  No one will know as long as they don't update their Magelo right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It's hard to update your Magelo when it won't even accept LDoN yet...<br />
<br />
Anyway, yeah I didn't buy LDoN because I'm not going to dump more money in when I'm leaving for Lineage 2 when it comes out in a few months (I hope). It sure sounds like fun though...</div></div><hr />
