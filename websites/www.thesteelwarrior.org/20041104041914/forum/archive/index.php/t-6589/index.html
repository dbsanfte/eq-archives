<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gaylon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have discussed recently how I was given a BoC by an old friend. :)<br />
<br />
I am not in a guild and just play with friends and the occasional pickup(s).<br />
<br />
Currently I am currently using BoC in mainhand and CHoS in offhand.<br />
<br />
Im shooting for an Ang3 Aug for the BoC.<br />
<br />
I really dislike the Hammer for reasons unrelated to its performance(i.e it does its job nicely but i still hate it). :) <br />
<br />
I don't see any options for someone in my position as far as upgrades to the hammer?<br />
<br />
Is it possible to &quot;build&quot; a worthy weapon to use with the BoC from LDON?<br />
<br />
Or should I just suck it up and spend the rest of my days looking like every Monk, Ranger, BST twink? :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bah i was afraid someone would say that. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kiya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The CHoS is pretty good, even if everyone gives their twinks one.   :( <br />
Your points would be better spent in anger augs and armor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Hiya Kiya :)  Heven't seen you in-game for while :(<br />
<br />
Thanks for setting me straight.  I just hate trying to MT in a LDON group against Rangers, Monks and BST wielding the same weapon i am. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kiya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You probably haven't seen me in a while cause I was on my cleric, heh.  Gameon's the name.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">So you don't like using your CHoS because other melee classes use one? Don't worry about that. Monk, rogues, rangers all have ways to lower their agro so you can keep it. If they are getting agro let them get hit and pretty soon they'll learn to control it...or die. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>ThornyEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think that in the &quot;reasonably buyable&quot; category, you're using the best you can for aggro (I should agree, I'm using the exact same combo ;)).<br />
<br />
In the &quot;reasonably acquirable&quot; category, there are a pair of no-drop weapons that might be good options: the Great Blade of Storms and the Fabled Short Sword of the Ykesha. Yes, 24 delay in the offhand is kinda slow for the f-yak, but 16 damage is nice, and so is that proc; and for a good single group, the fabled lord is easier to take down than Eindride Icestorm, and he drops the f-yak every time he pops, which is more than someone can say for Eindride and the GBoS (curse you, Eindride!). Unless, of course, the fabled lord doesn't pop anymore (haven't been in EQ for over a week due to the CoH beta, so not sure if they removed the fabled stuff yet).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Caldron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I agree gaylon that I hate looking like everyone else but My job is MT to hold aggro and therefore I will swing the cookie cutter combo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">could use the parryblade offhand if you still have it.<br />
<br />
as for ldon none can be made with dubble procs. except some drops and them all are dps procs i think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">How is the copper hammer better than the sword of the bloodsworn exactly?<br />
Could use that instead of the hammer if you wanted.<br />
<br />
The DPS? Cause if it's DPS that you're going on about, then you CAN make a comprable weapon out of LDoNs.<br />
<br />
If it's aggro, then Sword of the Bloodsworn could compete just as easily.</div></div><hr />

I agree that it's a better weapon than CHOS, but marginally. Offhanding this to the BoC will make its increased DPS rate negligable, and the extra DD over force strike doesn't do much. The + in aggro isn't nearly worth the huge chunk of cash you'd have to cough up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Binnamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">SoD is a waste of money in my opinion. It's far too expensive, and your money is better off buying something else. Or if you're like me... in the casino!<br />
<br />
Gayl, I'd keep the CHoS, and anger3 the BoC. It's your decision weather or not to anger the ChOS or put it into armor. For some reason magelo is gaying me out atm so I can't give reccomendations on that.<br />
<br />
Don't waste money on another offhander, CHoS is fine.</div></div><hr />

Well i will be going on a semi-pickup raid to Towers in a few weeks so perhaps the dice will be in my favor :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Zynth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">if you were going to buy a SoD the money would be better spent paying some people to get you a GBoS. i'd definatlly go for the GBoS every chance you get. the tower bosses are up every day, so if you hangout in BoT often you can probably catch a pick up raid, or start one your self.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Jaqyl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Another option, at least on my server, is to buy the Great Blade of Storms.  No I'm not on FV.  Xev has Kalr, he's a rogue in the top guild on the server that hydro's 7-8+ toons and kills BoT tower named and at least one SolRo mini and sells the looting rights to the nodrop items that drop.  His prices are pretty damn resonable at a set 50k for any nodrop BoT Tower boss item.  Your server may not have a Kalr, but it may have a small group of 2-3boxers that do essentially the same thing, you might want to check around.  I bought the FT2 helm off Thunderclap for my clericbot just cause its alot easier for me to cough up 50k than go through the headache of organizing a BoT Tower kill(even a single group run can have its headaches).</div></div><hr />

Hmm, interesting option.  Not sure how to go about finding out if such a &quot;Service&quot; is available on my server but for someone like me with little to no access to stuff I could use it would definately be nice.  50k is not that much to come by for me but then again on my server that 50k service would probably be 500k :(  Torvo = Greed.</div></div><hr />
