<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tiejinnie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Since we now know how the Provoke-line of abilities are going to be like, do you think it would still be the &quot;best&quot; option to go with Anger3 augs into weapons?<br />
<br />
Or would Yak procs now be more bang for the buck? Since Yak proc basically increases DPS a bit, and still generates some decent aggro.<br />

Your views?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Darkoan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have a hard time finding groups willing to do the Guk adventure :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Odd, one would think the belts from Guk would attract people ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tiejinnie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Groups across most servers generally avoid Guk if they can because:<br />
<br />
1. Mobs in general have more HP.<br />
2. Dungeon setup is quite confusing, or difficult to pull at times.</div></div><hr />

However if you've got a good group of friends, you can farm the hell out of the rare stuff that no one wants to go get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tiejinnie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Which is a waste, cos in Guk, you could get:<br />

Definitely not the &quot;best&quot; belt there is out there, but a good option for those who are not EP-enabled, or for those who do not belong in guilds who would ever do VT etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry but that belt just seems like a massive points sink (3570pts, 70 normal wins worth) that could better be spent on takish armor, anger augments or even the 1h wepaons if you're going that route. Much of the non-set armor items from LDoN are lacklustre even fully aug'd imo. If you're that hard up for haste grab a quested cof from sol.c if cash is a problem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hmm, wont ever loose aggro eh?  I guess you have never grouped with a paladin or a monk that never FDs after pulling or an over-nuking wizard.  I have monster aggro weapons and i still loose it to just about anyone that wants to take it.<br />

Sorry I have seen anything that says Dex directly effects proc rate.<br />

EDIT: Since Magelo is down I have BF (mainhand) Aug'd with 125dd ykesha and BoC (offhand) Aug'd with AngerII.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">If I was to make an haste item with augments, I'd go for a Royal Attendant Helmet of the Sand, it has very nice AC and base HP, you can put the +40 from HP augment in it, a +10 STA augment and also the 36% haste from Mistmoore.<br />
<br />
Would be something like this :<br />
[color=blue]Royal Attendant Helmet of the Sand (1492 AP, TAK)<br />
AC:39, Str:6, Sta:6, Agi:6, HP:75, Mana:75, FR:7, CR:7, PR:7,<br />

<br />
I think that would be better than the haste belt or cape.<br />
Though they were still very nice.<br />
<br />
Buggers me that you cannot put the 10 AC augment into the helmet though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Reason I chose the cape is because you won't be able to upgrade a 24ac 9sta 100hp 36% haste cape without some serious effort - VT drops, pain in the ass ToV quest, tier 3+ PoP. You could replace the helm with Ornate or HoRZ, both of which can be purchased.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tiejinnie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Ok ok hehe. BACK TO THE TOPIC! roflmao :D <br />
<br />
Now that we know how the Provoke ability works, and the progressive increase in aggro-creation across the levels, would Anger II or Anger III augment still be the best bang for the buck?<br />
<br />
Or would the Yak proc now actually be a better option?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Krowbar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The 125 dd yak proc is supposed to be around 400 hate since it has stun and pushback so I think its definitely better than anger II due to the similar aggro and superior dps. <br />
<br />
I need to test provoke some more on real servers under real conditions first but now Im seriously thinking of going for the yak proc over even anger 3 on my dual wield setup.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">id probably still go for anger 3. dont think you can ever have too much hate as opposed to a little bit more dps.<br />
<br />
anyway stun proc weps are a big no no on our raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Too much pushback I assume ?<br />
<br />
And yeah, I agree with the others, cannot have too much aggro.<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit : because I confuse myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">i think the point was also ably put by another warrior in relation to whether a warrior or sham should get symbol of the planemaster.<br />
<br />
simply put, whats more likely to save your raid -<br />
<br />
1. a 600 hate proc which may make the difference between keeping aggro on for example a time god or losing it which depending on the god can  = lots of dead peeps <br />
<br />
2. an extra 150 damage a couple of times a minute.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Originally posted by Tiejinnie <br />
Or would the Yak proc now actually be a better option?  More agro &gt; more DPS<br />
<br />
The increase in DPS is minimal as well. On a main hand weapon (2 proc/min) you gain 5 DPS, on an offhand weapon (1 proc/min) you gain 2.5 DPS. With an anger 3 weapon you are looking at adding 1200 hate per minute mainhand, 600 hate per minute offhand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I'm still planning on getting Anger III.  Hopefully tonight if the server isn't overly screwed up and I can get a group for 2 miragul adventures after the raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Anger 2= 760 points. <br />
<br />
No sir it is 510 pts from MiR...at least it was when I bought it for my GsoT.<br />
<br />
To answer the question: as no one can parse hate its a hard question to answer.   I guess the key question is that while Anger scales (400 hate for 2 and 700 for 3...correct me if wrong I am not an eq librarian) the yak procs only scale for damage (i.e. assuming the stun of the higher cost is not greater hate than the lower).<br />
<br />
So, it comes down to: how much adventuring do you want to spend on this?  I think from my own exp that Anger 3 truly is the big dog of the agro mods.  <br />
<br />
I'd guess that the agro generated between Anger 2 and the stun on the yak mod is a fair wash.  So if your goal is the quick path I'd take the low yak mod (you get DD + proc fer yer Ldon pts spent).  If its to add the biggest agro I'd save for Anger 3.<br />
<br />
Hope this makes some sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">A proc with stun and Damage does scale up a bit with the damage, just not as much as the Anger augments.<br />
<br />
So where the low end stun+DD procs might be better than low end anger procs, the reverse is true from the high end Anger procs. Basically, the Stun + DD scales from both components .. and since one component (the stun) remains the same, it just don't scale much.<br />
<br />
Seems all DD's get aggro much like weapons do .. maximum potential (non critical), which would explain why a resisted nuke can get wizard much aggro.<br />
<br />
With Stuns / slows / debuffs, it seems SOE have assigned a fixed amount of hate for how inconvenient the different spells are .. and someone said to themselves &quot;ooooo I hate being stunned ... +500 aggro&quot; :p<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
At least, that's how I perceive it from parses and stuffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Khumak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">IMO Anger III is still the way to go.  The highest level Provoke (Belittle?) only adds 400 initial hate and it takes a full 60 seconds to get the other 700 hate out of it.  Most fights don't last 60 seconds so you're likely to get anywhere from about 700-1100 aggro out of it.  That's the equivalent of only 1 to 1.5 EB procs per fight.  That will help for initial aggro but won't do that much to keep the mob on you for the rest of the fight.  For that you want Anger III.</div></div><hr />

How can you say that its been well established that Dex effects proc rate. The '2 procs per miniute&quot; is based on 280 Dex (or over 265 I think I read recently), as you lower yur dex the proc rate lowers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">i belive the shams have done a fair amount of parsing on dex on proc rates. cant find the thread but iirc more dex does mean more procs but the increase is relatively marginal.</div></div><hr />

 Proc rate and dex is something that I have studied for a long time with many different weapons. Just last week in the cave in pon killing Mephits (high 50's) and fighting for 105 mins I had 205 procs from GoT for one proc every 30.73 sec. This is what I have found for every weapon I have tested at dex of 265 or higher, WC, FB, Epics 1hs, epic 2hs, BP's the weapon made no differce the delay made no difference. Back when my dex was lower the testing I did showed a linear relationship between dex and proc rate. There is a huge difference in proc rate in short test but as you near 1hr or more I always come to 1 proc/30sec and the limited testing I did for offhand showed half that or 1 proc / 60 sec at &gt;= 265 dex.<br />
<br />
Just my two cents, take if for what is worth<br />

How can you say that its been well established that Dex effects proc rate. The '2 procs per miniute&quot; is based on 280 Dex (or over 265 I think I read recently), as you lower yur dex the proc rate lowers.What kind of broken gibberish is this? You have or haven't seen information relating dex to process rates?<br />
<br />
If the answer is 'you haven't' then you just stated yourself that lower dex affects process rates. :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">It does affect proc rates, but you have to remember that a lot warriors on this forum have 250+ DEX .. unbuffed. And some even 305 DEX unbuffed.<br />
<br />
Especially the ones that do parses.<br />
<br />
So therefore everyone that have done extensive parsing will come back and tell us that PPM is roughly 2 per minute, which is true, at their DEX and level.<br />
<br />
Anyways, as has been said, the bonus is marginal, so you'll probably have some 1.8 PPM with only 100 DEX. (just a guess)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Draganetti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Anger 3, no question.  <br />
<br />
If your group/raid wants more dps, get a rogue.  If your group/raid wants the mob hitting you, get anger 3.  I had force of ykesha first and switched to anger3 on BoW, and this is my first-hand comparison opinion.</div></div><hr />

Anyway Anker view is mine also, with 100 dex you get like 1.8 procs per minute (also just a wild guess) and with 265 plus you get 2.0 procs per minute.</div></div><hr />

Actually I'd say 305 dex gets you closer or past 2 procs per minute. I have around 250 dex or so unbuffed and I'm just shy of 2 procs per minute.<br />

And yes, I have several parses.</div></div><hr />
