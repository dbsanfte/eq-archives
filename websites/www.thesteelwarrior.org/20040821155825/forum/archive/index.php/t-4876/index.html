<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Malek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Cause it sure as hell doesn't seem like it.  I know what 700  hate does, and it's enough to cover a slow on inc.  So you'd think that pulling with Incite and several seconds of melee would be enough to cover a slow, by which time a tick for 70 more hate has passed, but not always.  About 50/50.  I get better aggro with a stun proc at the start of a fight then Incite.<br />
<br />
I also have yet to pull aggro by hitting Incite.  Sometimes it can be hard to tell if the mobs casting or stunned when you hit it, but so far I've not had a single mob snap around the second I press the button.<br />
<br />
And when a monk pulls a mob into camp I have yet to pull aggro with Incite before he FD's.  I find it hard to believe that the initial aggro he gets from pulling is more than 400 hate.<br />
<br />
So is it just me or is this so called 400 hate just bs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rasco</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I pull with my bow, incite as the mobs gets to me, attack on and taunt rigth away has always held aggro through tash and slow for me.<br />
I have also gotten snap aggro from just hitting incite. Happened in droga when a gater brought back about 6 friends and cleric got a spider on her due to CH aggro for healing someone else in our party.<br />
As far as pulling aggro off of a puller on inc, I've never been able to do it with just incite</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It could have some of the same issues SK terror spells have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dafrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm seeing where your coming from Malek. I experience the same things. Seems a huge difference between 600 Hate augmented proc, and 400 hate with dot. 600 has always turned the mob on me...maybe slow is in between somewhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I find that if you use Incite for pulling (and by pulling I mean it actually takes time for you to run back to camp so your hate dot can kick in), or at near melee range then it's fine.  Trying to tag a mob at max distance of Incite doesn't seem to give you the full 400 hate since I'd see a mob I Incite at max range stop and hit someone else who's just standing there, even though it seems like 400 hate ought to be enough to make a mob chase you.  After all, it is enough to deal with a slow, and mob's always run after a slower if you're not trying to get aggro.  <br />
<br />
I don't know the exact distance but I think it has to be pretty clsoe to melee... probably close eonugh you can't use a range weapon at least.  I managed to move an ice boned skeleton across a Wayfarer Camp of AFK people with just one incite so 400 hate is definitely enough to move something, even with *undead aggro*, if you get the full 400 hate effect.  The trick is finding out how close you've to be to get the 400.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Cily</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I am not sure it is a range thing. I have pulled some MOBs off of people from pretty far away.<br />
<br />
The problem I have is if I use it before I am on the agro list. In these cases it seems to do close to zero agro generation.<br />
<br />
Cily</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Seems to work fine for me.  I wasn't the puller in most of my groups this weekend and all I'd do was hit incite at max range and the mobs went straight to me 95% of the time - even when the puller was a ranger that shot the mob 4 or 5 times on inc.  Every now and then I'd incite a second time (if I had a low dps grp), but normally the initial incite was enough.  (I use GSoT btw)<br />
<br />
It didn't seem great at pulling a mob off someone if they were damaging it, but if they were just standing there it worked fine.  In one case I was even able to pull an add off our secondary tank (he was 61 using the droga wpns)...course, he kept beating on it till he got agro back and then almost died cause we only had 1 healer and 3 mobs...gotta love AE taunt and the ability to use more discs now :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Khumak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If someone else is pulling and I use Incite at about a range of 50 or less, the mob almost always turns and runs straight to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bonequest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">When you are pulling hit with bow to get initial puller agro, then incite and run back to camp.<br />
<br />
When you are not not pulling, hit with bow on incoming.  Attack with sword as soon as mob is in melee range, then taunt, then incite.  If taunt fails incite still moves you way up agro list.  If taunt succeeds incite puts you way over what puller had and leapfrogs you a whole lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>ThornyEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Experience below related by a level 63 warrior, in a BoT South Bottom group that lasted about 5 hours. The rest of the group was level 62-65, so mobs were either yellow, white, or very high blue; no reds.<br />
<br />
I used incite quite a bit last night in BoT. Our monk would pull and I would start shooting arrows at the mob on inc. I would then start to melee it. Note that I've not used incite as of yet. As soon as I saw the shaman's slow lands, the mob would typically turn to the shaman. This is when I'd hit incite, and 95 out of 100 times the mob would snap right back to me. The other times I had to pray for a successful taunt.<br />
<br />
Basically, after attaining initial aggro, incite seems to be just a bit more hate than the hate thrown around by a level 64 shaman slowing.<br />
<br />
I played with pulling with incite, tossing incite out on inc, starting the fight with an incite, and frankly, the way it worked best is if I just used it as a &quot;guaranteed successful&quot; taunt somewhere after aggro was established. I'm generally happy with it that way; it's not too overpowering but it's certainly workable.<br />
<br />
Oh, one thing incite worked really well on: toss it on a mezzed mob that's been slowed, tashed, snared, etc. while mezzed. do this right before breaking mezz. Not once in the entire night's proceedings did an incited mob that had been gone over by the shaman/chanter/druid turn on them after breaking mezz. This was a huge improvement over the previous &quot;taunt and hope&quot; method.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Malek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Thorny the &quot;taunt and hope&quot; method has been improved to &quot;taunt till you don't see a fail message&quot; which is when I would suggest an incite and mez break.  That way you get all the chanters aggro+incite on break.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Cimmar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I am also having problems pulling off a monk with incite (at a distance) if i get close to the mob they always turn on me instead of the monk. Range aggro sucks on purpose or all the casters would be dead</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kadah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">65 war,<br />
BoT / HoH Group<br />
Had a few dumb chanter's chain slowing which &quot;I&quot; let die for a change. Note I let them.<br />
I tiold them after they where rezzed each time, Hey I have better aggro, but I wont waste it if you just plan to chain slow.<br />
The first two left saying I was a prick, Yay! me.<br />
<br />
The third was actully bright he didnt die once, He waited for me to control aggro, and played along telling how incite helped him so much better in what he could do. (i.E Charm etc)<br />
<br />
There is no room for stupidity in caster classes, Warriors are sop much more balanced now then ever before. If anyone says we are not, Then they are grouping with idioits that dont understand how their class work's. <br />
<br />
Not that I advocate to other's how to play their class, yet this is a step in a more active, then lazy role for all classes. I can keep aggrio off the malo, and then the turgar's or the ressit, But I cant keep it if they chain slow till it land's, nor should they feel they have to chain slow. <br />
<br />
Most xp mobs, Take tier 3 for example, hit weak, slow,wont 1 or 2 round most now and arent very much of a challange Slow just makes it easier to deal with them. <br />
<br />
With the innate mitigation boost this just proves it more, Warriors are starting to shine like we did back in the day, However I'd like more mitigation personally, Maybe a extra 6% to top us off at 10% better innate mitigation. <br />
<br />
But thats a wish list, and one I think is very possible for us to get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">never seemed to have much of a problem pulling aggro off pullers with a bow, so it surprises me to hear that incite doesnt do it so easily.<br />
<br />
i ahve been wondering about the 400 hate figure myself. i know when the mobs in camp its not enough to overcome an early slow.<br />
yet my old aggro weps like GSoT, CHoS would keep aggro on me with an early proc.<br />
<br />
So does that mean that the procs on GSoT and CHoS are more than 400 aggro?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I also have yet to pull aggro by hitting Incite. <br />

Same here.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Think its great .... bow pull inc to camp, attack slam incite ... mobs mine 99% of the time.<br />
<br />
Best fun tankin 2 sometimes 3 mobs and holding them ..... workin as intended IMO :) <br />
<br />
Play with Guild players though so may make a huge diff'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Sounds like you want to be actively on the mobs hate list first before the incite has it's full effect and/or need to be within normal aggro radius so that the mob 'see's you' to apply the full value to you after the incite, would mirror the SK pure hate line in that respect(?).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">It almost feels like you need to hit a mob a few times to refresh the hate you just did via Incite.  It's like the game registers 400 Hate but it doesn't give you credit for it until you actually hit the mob.  It's like how a caster can overaggro and then back off and not get hit due to proximity aggro, but in reverse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Tasso</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">ive noticed even before this that if my boc proced on pull (no arrows) and i dragged it back to camp the slow would still pull aggro to the shammy.<br />
<br />
I have been using this as more of a 2nd taunt (3rd with aoe taunt)<br />
<br />
I have seen the mob turn to another player and i hit incite and it snaps back to me like if i had proced with the boc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Khumak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">If I Incite a mob that someone else pulls before it gets to camp it turns and runs straight to me rather than to the puller.  So it does not depend on your inflicting any damage on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Malek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Ran a little test on a goblin food supplier in Droga with a 65 war and 65 shammy.

Neither char did anything to the goblin during this time.  Second incite took aggro.<br />
I find it hard to believe slow is more than 1100 hate as I have never lost aggro to a slow after an EB proc.</div></div><hr />

How long are you fighting before you ussually Proc that EB?<br />
Even if its 100dmg = 50hate, in 10 seocnds you've made that difference up...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Malek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">It can be a proc on the pull and slow on inc.  If the shammy sits right after slow, then it will take aggro.  Certainly don't need 10 seconds of melee+eb proc to cover slow aggro.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've found this too.  I find it additionally entertaining in the sense that I am basically calling a mobs mother a skanky whore, and he chases me, all the while getting madder and madder at me as it simmers inside his peanut sized brain that his mom is a hobag.  I picture in my head the BoT Giants muttering under their breath as they run after me &quot;call my mother a whore, I'll show you you sonofabitch, I'm gonna turn you around and make you MY whore blah blah blah&quot;.  <br />
<br />
Seems to make sense to me as far as why a mob might wanna beat you down.  I like it over Anger augs in that sense.  It makes more sense to want to kill someone because they insult your lineage then because a sword goes *flash*.  Ideally would be nice to be able to purchase new &quot;Tomes&quot; in LDoN to add to my repetoire of cursewords instead of anger augments.   Instead of buying anger3 maybe on top of incite, could add a second skill to &quot;say, 'and your sister was great in bed, too'&quot;.  <br />
<br />
On a rambling note, three months ago in an exp group I got a good laugh by &quot;demonstrating my new Warrior Aggro skill&quot;.  I hotkeyed a four line /say Hey %T your mother was great last night.  /say And you're ugly, too.  Maybe one of the groupmates was a developer :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>proteg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">&quot;I find it hard to believe slow is more than 1100 hate as I have never lost aggro to a slow after an EB proc.&quot;<br />
<br />
Uhhhhhhh.   &quot;?&quot;  Soo, you can make your EB weap proc without any dps?  I know of a few EB weapons that put out ok dps.  Perhaps by the time they proced you had decent aggro based on damage as well to aid the EB?  It's a possability.  <br />
<br />
Who said Incite was 1100 Hate?  Incite generates a certain amount of Hate.  It is in the computer code, and Sony can change it at any time.  The developer who said it was currently at 1100 hate did not say it would be released as such.  <br />
<br />
When some guild pallies were doing the ol' FG shard, they and a shammy and Cler ran some half-assed tests.  Among their tests, they had a Shammy slow, then had a Pally beat it off him just using melee damage.  Usually took around (?) 700-900 dmg.  Not sure if i remember that.  I remember a stun took around 1000+ melee damage to pull off.  I remember that it was more then a slow.  <br />
<br />
In other words, if you proced an EB, you probably have a significant amount of melee aggro built up on top of the proc.  iirc EB is around the hate of 750 melee damage.  So basically its around the same amount of damage you need to pull off a slow all by itself.  <br />
<br />
This test ran regarding Incite and the shammy slow tells me that either the slow WE used to test is a different slow, or that Incite only produces around 600-700 Hate in total.  In other words, you cannot slow a mob on a pull no matter how long a pull it is, warriors have to deal some form of damage to maintain aggro through a slow.  Fine by me.  <br />
<br />
All I know is that Enchanter slowers don't quiver in their boots any more, and mobs can safely get slowed in a resonable amount of time.  Simply put, the game is fun again, but not so damned easy I will get bored.  Hats off to Sony.  Lord knows I've bitched enough about this.  <br />
<br />
If you don't have a clue regarding damage related aggro, try a four winds and try a greatstaff of thunder.  The four winds holds aggro better despite the fact the thunder procs a stun and knockback.  Why?  It puts out that much more damage.  Don't discount the aggro off of pure melee damage.  Why you think Rogues and Monks can pull aggro off of you?<br />
<br />
EDIT: In response to the original question regarding whether Incite is 400 Hate... might be, by the test run above, it seems less then a slow, and SOny sure as hell did not state its total would definately end up being 1100 hate.  Either way, it seems freaking great to me.  I'm not exactly standing there picking my nose in that time, I'm beating the living crap out of the mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Aveen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I like incite a lot, but I think its still a tad underpowerd. I haven't tried pulling with it yet, but I still feel that it is only margionally better than taunt right now. There are mobs (especially in ldon) where I can use incite and be fine, and then there are mobs still that no matter what i can't seem to get agro. Taunt wont turn them, incite wont turn them, 5 hate procs in a span of 12 seconds wont turn them. <br />
<br />
I would like to see the initial hate on incite bumped up by about 150 hate or have the timer be shortend by 10 seconds (for a 20 second timer).  As it is, it really isn't enough yet. I don't want absolutly ensured agro. it would be boring if the mob never turned away, but at the same time I would like to see the tools have more of an effect on the mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>proteg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">&quot;but I think its still a tad underpowerd&quot;<br />
<br />
Figure out how to hack a God mode then, cause thats what youre asking for.  Incite is fine.  <br />
<br />
Learn how aggro works, you obviously need to look at the numbers more.  This is not a mystical thing here guys.  It is a computer, not magic.  It all comes down to a number somewhere.  Somwhere in that little computerized brain of the mob is a number called &quot;Who I Hate Most and Want to Kill&quot;.  Which ever toon has the largest Hate sits up here and thats who the mob beats on.  That is it.  Period.  There is nothing mystical about this.  The mob beats on someone other then you because they have a higher number then you.  <br />
<br />
If you proc 5 hate procs on top of Incite and regular old malee dps aggro and the mob won't beat on you, someone else (gee, maybe the person who is getting beat on, try /assist to find out who it is) is REALLY putting a lot of hate into the mob.  They obviously don't have a clue what they are doing.  5 Hate procs from Anger3 is the same aggro as a nuke for 3000 dmg.  On top of that, Incite is the hate of a 400-1100 dmg nuke, depending on how long its ben sitting there on the mob.  Add to that your melee damage, and you find that someone must have DRASTICALLY put in aggro.  <br />
<br />
&quot;As it is, it really isn't enough yet.&quot; - Do you want CH and Mez along with your new Jesus Christ aggro?  Someone else in your group does not know how to play their toon.  /assist the mob to find out who, then ask them to put in less hate.  Takes 5 seconds.  If its a shammy who pulls aggro off of slow, ask them to figure out how long it takes you to beat the mob off of them onto you, then wait that long before slowing next time.  That is the amount of hate OVER the hate you have put into the mob that they have put into the mob.  <br />
<br />
If it is a nuker who nukes too early, ask them to chill on nukes a little until you guys get warmed up and learn each others aggro better. <br />
<br />
BTW to any Pallies or Devs reading this post, no, warriors are not crazy enough to claim 5 EB procs and Incite is not enough.  At least not all of us.  You Devs did very good, thank you.  You pallies, considering your ideas you came up with ended up contributing to our fix, thank you too (GOD that hurt to say that).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Malek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">&quot;Who said incite was 1100 hate?&quot;<br />
<br />
Uhhhhh &quot;?&quot; how about Lucy?<br />
<br />
And please stop spewing x amount of dmg equals x amount of hate as if you know this for a fact.<br />
<br />
And yes, it is possible to proc eb, or any proc without dealing dps because you can proc on a miss genius.<br />
<br />
Overall, I'm happy with the changes, but when you compare 700 hate proc vs 400 hate + 700 dot something doesn't seem to be &quot;working as intended&quot; imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>proteg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Lol Malek.  I don't care if you believe a word I say.  Smart people won't believe anything without thinking about it and running small tests: ie checking it out on their own.  If you already have I am completely open to hearing your results.  Really.  I can be open minded on rare occasions and I think today I can.  <br />
<br />
Proc on a miss?  So you miss every hit between when you start meleeing the mob and when the Shaman casts slow?  Or do Shammies you fight with slow on inc and you land a lucky first proc?  This one I am curious about.  <br />
<br />
 &quot;working as intended&quot; imo<br />
Of course you are entitled to that.  Happy Holidays :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Arathena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">There are very odd caps involving pure hate and the very early stages of the battle. What you're seeing here is the results of those caps, and it's the same kind of thing that happens with terrors. The provoke and terror lines are unique in the game in that they are the only methods in the game to generate true, raw, hate. Even a miss-and-proc from an Eblow weapon carries the hate generated by the missed swing. (Search for the various melee-aggro generation threads for corroboration.) There's no real consesus among SKs on how to use terrors, since because of this factor, the value of terrors is very much crippled. <br />
<br />
Those that do use the terrors, however, will generally use it to solidify aggro, rather than try to regain it. In general, aggro gaining for me tends to go Snare-Melee-Terror. Like us, I suspect that as an 'initial aggro' tool, you're vastly underusing the initial 400 aggro. <br />
<br />
In example: <br />
Monk pulls mob. Pull process generated 10 hate. Mob on monk.<br />
On inc, warrior incites mob. Cap generates 200 hate. Produces 150 more melee hate +70 more Incite hate, before Slow lands, generating (say) 500 hate: Result: mob on shaman until warrior generates 80 more hate. <br />
<br />
Alternate Scenario 1: <br />
Monk Pulls mob. Generates 10 hate.<br />
Warrior engages w/bow or melee, generating 20 hate. Mob on warrior. Warrior incites, generating 400 hate. Warrior generates 80 more melee hate + 70 hate incite tick, placing him at 570 when shaman's 500 hate slow lands. Mob never blinks at shaman.<br />
<br />
Alternate Scenario 2: <br />
Monk pulls, generating 10 hate. Warrior engages, generating 100 melee hate before 500 hate of slow lands. Warrior incites, generating 400 hate. As shaman and warrior have same aggro, lazy mob swipes at nearest target. <br />
<br />
The capped nature of isolated hate is very difficult to pin down exactly, and no one fully understands it to our knowledge. <br />
<br />
There is, of course, the possibility that I'm talking out my ass, but something's gotta explain why I can generate 200+ aggro a second with terrors and still lose aggro to a single slow if I don't back it up with something 'real'.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Malek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I said it was possible to proc without making contact, I didn't say it happens every pull.  And yes, the shammy knows when it's safe to slow because I bot him, and if I proc on a pull the slow button is getting mashed until the mob is in range.<br />
<br />
and happy holidays to you too ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>proteg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">My roundabout point was that youre nice dps hate ought to be enough for decent aggro along with Incite from what I have seen. <br />

Seems Incite is the &quot;little extra&quot; but not lock on that lots asked for.  And it seems very nice as is.  To me and a lot others.  I just don't want to get something nice and then just keep asking for more.</div></div><hr />

Sounds like you want to be actively on the mobs hate list first before the incite has it's full effect and/or need to be within normal aggro radius so that the mob 'see's you' to apply the full value to you after the incite, would mirror the SK pure hate line in that respect(?).  <br />
<br />
I kind feel the same way here.  Except I think it really has to do with proximity.  I notice if I incite at max or near max range on a pull and am not in the direct path of the inc mob very often it will continue on after the puller until I get close enough to &quot;kick&quot; the aggro in.<br />
<br />
If I line myself up in the mobs inc path and hit incite right as he is getting on top of me most of the time I will get that 'snap' aggro.<br />
<br />
Also it could be different pulling techniques.  I group with a rogue that likes to pull...he also likes to Backstab for his initial tag.  Depending on how much hate the puller builds up and the tanks proximity to target on inc, incite may not be enough to overcome in certain situations.</div></div><hr />

Let them pull green mobs with the debuffing/aggro spells they normally use on exp/raid setting, then you use Incite to pull it off them.<br />
<br />
See how many Incites it takes to pull mob off. No DPS, No Taunt, No procs. <br />
<br />
In exp setting, 1 Incite is not enough to regain aggro from slow aggro.  Tested that enough times already while in adventures.<br />
<br />
Too many people continue to assume Incite is powerful enough to do it on its own, without taking in account their hate from DPS, procs going off before Incite and Taunt.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Burst agro at the beginning of a fight after I'm already in melee- Usually it hits just after a successful slow, and a successful taunt.<br />

Or later in the fight if I realize I forgot to use it, and have had a number of failed taunts in a row.</div></div><hr />

To set the stage:  Lvl 65 Ogre War, 109AA's wielding Great blade of storms in Primary and Copper Hammer of Striking off hand after an Avatar proc from my Primal...  typical group buffs put me at 305 to my top four stats, 8400hp, 1505AC and roughly 1650ATK...<br />
<br />
I almost never pull...  Always end up with a ranger, bard or chanter pulling depending on who I'm grouping with and where.  Everyone stands on incomming, I meet the mob when he gets to camp, attack and taunt. I try to time my first taunt to land right after the chanter tashes which puts me 1 point over the chanters agro assuming that taunt doesn't fail.  After my first successful taunt I'll use incite. this puts me one point over the top of the agro list, then adds a 400 hate buffer on top of it.  I'm still adding agro from dual wielding decent weapons, Stun and 179DD procs and I pretty much only have to taunt if the mob turns away from me.  If the mob turns on the a rogue or a monk or something I'll taunt once, get him back on me and incite if its recycled or use spirit of rage if I have to to build my agro back up.  More then ever now, agro control is all about timing.  Even if that first taunt fails I very seldom ever lose agro to a tash and if I do the mob won't get through the chanters Rune before I can get it back on me.  Sony isn't going to make it easy to control agro.  We will never get and never should get an &quot;agro lock&quot; button.  But they will give you the tools to hold agro.  Its up to you to learn how to use them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Heh, at first he's praying.  After a few pulls they stop worrying about it and tash / slow / whatever they are doing.  I have to assume from the reactions I get from pickup groups that I'm the only warrior in BoT who can hold agro... lol<br />
<br />
I know one warrior who uses incite to pull mobs and holds agro just fine.  But he also has a BoC and a GBoS with Anger III Augs on both and I'm sure 305 in all the melee stats.  He could probably turn on auto attack and walk away to watch TV and not loose agro.  Less well equiped warriors still have to work at it but if your paying attention and not just spamming your taunt key and jamming the incite button as soon as it pops up you'll find out its really not that hard to hold agro.  You just have to think about what your doing.   Even before the addition of Incite I rarely lost agro on a tash and a slow would only steal agro for a split second if I missed a few taunts in a row.<br />
<br />
The real problem is that warriors can buy decent armor and weapons in the bazaar with plat they bought on PA and powerlevel themselves to 65 without ever learning how to play thier class.  The same could be said for any class really but people assume that a warrior is the easiest class to play so alot of warriors get twinked.  You just point towards the mob and hit the attack key.  taunt if your the main tank.  If only that were true...  those people have no idea about positioning mobs to maximize the groups DPS or how to single pull with sit agro.  They don't understand kick and bash agro or how taunt really works or any of the things you need to actually play the charactor to learn.   I started my warrior long before kunark was released and dinged level 60 the day before they did the remove hell levels patch.  In that much time and being in a small guild that couldn't kill much more then Giants in the arena in kael i learned to play a warrior and take advantage of what little strengths we did have.  I'm not in a time guild or even elemental for that matter but I know my class and I'm very good at playing it.</div></div><hr />

I held aggro fine beforehand, but then again I know how aggro works and how to communicate nicely with my group members to get them to play in a fashion that we all succeed.  Now I don't have to spend the first 30 minutes of the group teaching everyone how aggro works...<br />
<br />
We did not &quot;need&quot; Incite before, but it sure as fuck makes the game &quot;fun&quot; and not &quot;work&quot;.  Hmmm, I take that back, we needed Incite lol.  It IS a game right?  It SHOULD be fun right?  <br />
<br />
In all seriousness, what Incite has done is drastically increased the groupage I get with people who don't already know me.  Previous, the vast majority of my groups had soneone in the group already who could vouch that I could hold aggro fine or I had to simply make the group myself (bah, work).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well on my main weap I don't have an aggro proc and I have no issues holding aggro.  Of course, I had no issues before the patch.  <br />
<br />
I was on the Warrior's aren't broke, but people don't know how to play EQ anymore so might as well give us more aggro to make us work with the newbs side of the debate.  <br />
<br />
Honestly, if you can't hold aggro with Incite and an easy to acquire weapon, I would never hold you in any respect at all.  GSoTs go for 50pp on my server lately.  I dicked around with one one night to see how Incite helped it out and found it to be solid even without a proc.  If you can't do the same then you have issues.  <br />
<br />
I was in a group a few weeks ago where I was watching them invised as their SK MT could not hold aggro.  Mob was ponging all over the place, and the Cleric was healing someone else in the group when the SK went down.  I jumped in and took over just for the hell of it.  The SK LDed and did not come back.  They invited me, and on the first pull the mob jumped all over the place.  I politically and gently coaxed them into trying it my way on the next pull, and when it went smoothly I did not say &quot;look how much better this is&quot; but just kept the pulls coming.  After a few hours and several nameds dropped (BoT East crawling) they all commented on how much better fighting that way was...<br />
<br />
The issue had nothing to do with aggro generation as the SK was having issues (he has a good rep on the server).  It has everything to do with incompetent groups.  The solution is communication and discretion.  Incite gives us as Warrior more leeway on the aggro issue, but if you are in an incompetent group, you still need to communicate.  Gently.  <br />
<br />
I saw a war with a BoW rep someone and the first pull, mob ponged all over... then they stood there without pulling for a minute, then resumed pulls and there was absolutely no ponging the rest of the night.  I assume the War or someone said &quot;guys, lets do it this way&quot;.  Communication succeeds.  <br />
<br />
Incite and aggro procs merely give us a set of tools to work with.  Still gotta make sure group knows how to play though... (recently, I'd give it about a 65% chance someone in the group needs to learn how to play now, so I expect to be in tells with every group)</div></div><hr />

<br />
You should just say, &quot;I never had any aggro issues even before Incite as long as my group did little to nothing to the mob.&quot;  Because it doesn't matter how skilled a warrior is, he has no control over when his weapons proc or when taunt will actually succeed.<br />
<br />

The issue with aggro is groups who do not know how to play EQ, if you re-read my post, and you obviously have major reading comprehenshion issue if you actually read it through (no surprise to me), then you MIGHT maybe, just possibly but oh so unlikely pick up the point that SKs and Paladins have it easier on holding aggro, as would a warrior with a BoW or other higher end aggro weapon, then a lesser equipped warrior.  But in observing (yes, this is how us smart people come to what we like to refer as conclusions, we actually watch and analyze what we are seeing, then when we come to an actual &quot;conclusion&quot; [www.dictionary.com, I know you will need it] we observe even MORE to confirm our original conclusion).  <br />
<br />
I'm sorry I used to many big words, if you need me to dumb it down more for you I can try bashing my head against the wall and drinking forty quarts of vodka to TRY, really honestly TRY to get down to your level of ineptitude and incompetence.

When your head begins to hurt with all this &quot;thinking stuff&quot; you can go to health.yahoo.com to find out why your headie hurtsie.  <br />
<br />
Hold back on Nukes dots slows?  Yeah, for the 5-7 seconds it took to build aggro.  Heaven forbid they wait 5 seconds or 10 seconds on a mob.  When you add that up over several hours, they missed how many seconds of nuking?  Oh wait a second, did I hear that there is more to EQ then nuking in that 5 second span?  Oh there I go again with increasing the complexity of the discussion for you.  I should know better then that.  *pounds fist on desk several times*<br />
<br />
Ok, going to repeat my point one last time in anticipation of your skipping to the end, I know how hard this reading stuff is for you... /obvious on: No matter how high a rate your aggro generation is these days, there is still the need to communicate with the members of your group to coordinate and clean up group efforts because it is so damn easy to get to 65 now.  *gapes in utter shock*<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Besrikarle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">I still dont like how incite used at range really does nothing. Example, pulling with my bard (which bards are like the lowest aggro pullers ever) using incite to tag, the mob will still run to the bard and hit him. Thats 400 hate vs whatever bard song i use to pull. Now if i run behind bes and train her, like you normally would do, the mob will hit bes np. But if the bard is off to the side, the tiny song aggro overcomes the instant 400 hate and 70 per tick dot. It just doesnt work at a range or something. I guess this is similar to the way the SK terror lines function to? Wish it would be fixed. This alone causes a bit of mistrust in the ability to me.</div></div><hr />

I can position myself in a way that I am out of melee range of the mob  when this happens, and then the mob will attack my pet even though I snared on it on incoming.  I have no idea how much aggro Engulfing Darkness but it seems like it can't be that low (it's a snare after all) and yet my green pet can grab aggro if I'm not in melee range after casting it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Panazule</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">The entire point of all of this has nothing to do with whether or not your group has the intelligence to manage their aggro or not.<br />
<br />
If that is the basis of your &quot;Warriors are not broke&quot; argument then I am sorry, it's flawed.<br />
<br />
Sure, a group can decide to cripple their dps and kill speed to compensate for the warriors aggro generation compared to a knights.<br />
<br />
But why would the group want a warrior tank then? Just get that SK/Paladin who will hold the aggro through tash and slow.  This will massively increase the groups kill speed which means more experience for the Exp group.<br />
<br />
If your referring to warriors not being broken on raids, I'll go along with that certainly but in regards to being able to do our job in a exp group that is averaging 20-30 second kills, all we'll do if we choose for that group to properly manage aggro is cause those 20-30 second kills to be 30-40 second kills.<br />
<br />
You wind up with pissed off clerics because they have to work harder because the mob can't be slowed as fast.  You wind up with pissed off nukers because they can't nuke earlier.  And you wind up with an entire upset pickup group because their experience is going slower.<br />
<br />
Someone made a comment of even if I lose aggro to a tash or a slow it only takes me a second or so to get it back even with a failed taunt or two.   I'd like this to be explained a bit.<br />
<br />
If your taunt fails 3 times in a row and your weapon doesn't proc a hate, what exactly are you doing to get aggro back? Please, Enlighten us.<br />
<br />
Refresh on the taunt button is more than a second or two and every one here I am sure has watched it fail up to 7-8 times in a row.<br />
<br />
The point of balancing in EQ is to enable every class to do their role in EQ and for every class to be an assett in a group and raid environment.<br />
<br />
Warriors are melee only, we have inferior dps, hp is meaningless once you break 7k in an exp group and have no skills to compensate for only having a low percent chance of the taunt button being successful or hoping that the random proc goes off in the beginning.<br />
<br />
If the answer to fixing warriors is to ask everyone to gimp down their exp groups then that is just plain ridiculous.<br />
<br />
Sure there are people who have no clue how to properly use their taunt buttons and are plenty who have no idea how to properly use incite and your right, those people have it much worse off than the people with a clue but even those who do understand the logistics of how the system works, are still left with the facts of the situation -  Not enough hate generate to allow your group to play in the same style as if there was a pal/sk tank.<br />
<br />
On top of this, We can't allow ourselves to judge and view the warrior class and its needs by comparing to those with BoW's, BF's, BoC's, etc.<br />
<br />
Even an Anger III proc on a non EB weapon, the proc rate is so much lower on non eb weapons it doesn't help near as much.<br />
<br />
When my screen isn't littered with &quot;Your taunt has failed&quot; messages as I hope for my 2 eb weapons to proc to turn that mob and I think about how someone without eb weapons would feel right now, I will stick to my opinion that much more needs to be done.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If I line myself up in the mobs inc path and hit incite right as he is getting on top of me most of the time I will get that 'snap' aggro.<br />

<br />
If you think your group does less DPS because of your aggro you're the problem not the group (well, the group is messed up too...)  I try to look for Knights when I make groups for LDoN and I have never seen DPS gone up just because one is present because my groups last longer than 15 minutes which gives everyone plenty of time to run out of mana, and since most people would rather not use up mana too early the actual aggro you need is often MUCH less.  Parses show Warriors can outdamage Wizards in a decently long (30 minute+) LDoN mission and if someone can get aggro while doing less damage than you, that's their problem not yours.

You don't play any sort of high level nuker class do you?<br />
<br />
Parse the kills per hour in a good dps group.<br />
<br />
It's often the difference between that nuker landing an extra nuke per fight and the shaman getting to land that dot because they didn't need to wait for aggro to be established to finish their slows and such.<br />
<br />
To actually think there is no difference in kills per hour between a tank that can solidly hold aggro and one where the group has to hold back some just isn't logical.<br />
<br />
Even just a 10 second difference per kill adds up tremendously over time, which your using in your example.<br />
<br />
Of course your right, with good gear noone would have to hold back of course the MA of the fight would turn into everyone but the Warrior, which brings us back to the original problem now doesn't it, of aggro control being out of balance with tanking ability/gear/spells.<br />

Again, If your going to compare here, please don't compare the SK/Paladin group to that of a group that has a PoTime geared warrior.  Compare average geared MA's.</div></div><hr />

A Time Warrior can easily let a Time Wizard unload to OOM in 10 minutes.  If an average warrior has half the aggro ability of a Time Warrior (as my weapons certainly don't have twice the ratio than some easily obtainable weapons, this does not appear unreasonable), and an average Wizard has half the mana of a Time Wizard, it'd still stand to reason you can do the same in 10 minutes.  Or, if that is an overestimate of the warrior's aggro and/or underestimate of wizard's mana pool, let's say we're off by a factor of 3, so that gives you 30 minutes.  Still a short time as far as XP group is concerned.  <br />

I have never heard of anyone, aside from possibly shamans, who have so much mana that they don't know how to use up over the course of say an hour, which is a pretty reasonable time for an xp group to last.</div></div><hr />

What about the mana saved by the cleric because the mob is slowed as soon as it gets to the knight (instead of 10 seconds later for the warrior)?  What about the mana regen all casters get from being able to sit immediately after casting a spell since they don't have to worry about sit agro with a knight?  What about the utility provided by knight spells - doesn't this effectively saves other casting classes mana?<br />
<br />
I'm not saying warriors are still horribly out of balance, but I still think knights are a better MA in most xp groups.  (if the knights know how to use their spells to control agro)<br />
