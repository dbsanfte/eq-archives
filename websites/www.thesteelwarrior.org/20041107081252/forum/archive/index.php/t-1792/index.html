<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Wasted at least an hour in 2 different groups with my little 50th rogue in KC this weekend. <br />
<br />
Why? <br />
<br />
Because the only healer in the groups though it quite acceptable to leave to get C3. To PoK! That is at least 4 zones you have to go though before you get back to your healerless group.  Friggin rediculous!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Trast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Don't forget Protection of the Nine, Beasty Crack, Spell Casting haste, etc. It's all the unbalancing of the devil!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">it's kinda sad really how many people are 'spoilt' now, downside to making the world so small i guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Its not the unbalancing that bothered me...<br />
<br />
(as a rogue with 11/22 main hand and either 10/20 (1hb) or 13/25 (1hs) off hand it doesn't really bother me) <br />
<br />
but the fact that they left the group for it! So addictided they would leave a well running XP for over 10 minutes for the damned thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Fixing the level restriction workaround was a good first step for SoE to take to fix the KEI problem, but I think they need to take it further.  KEI(and all mana regen buffs, outside self buffs) should have duration lowered to 30 minutes, and mana regen from the buff should be modified by the buffed persons level(so to get full mana regen from buff you need to be 65).  Make those 2 changes and I think it would just be a better game.<br />
<br />
My number 1 alt is a mage(60 as of yesterday woohoo).  I self buff for 4 points of mana regen, mod every 5 minutes(total from modding averages out to I believe 7 mana per tick) and yet if I am invited to a group, I am frequently told 'no C3 in group, make sure you get one before heading over'.  That is just wrong.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kiya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Bah, stinky little monkeys need to learn to manage their mana!  Blessed Armor of the Risen (on clr) or Protection of the Cabbage (on dru) is enough regen for me.  If I get mana regen upon joining the group, great!  If not, I make do.  =P</div></div><hr />
