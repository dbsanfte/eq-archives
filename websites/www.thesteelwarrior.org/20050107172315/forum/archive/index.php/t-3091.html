<br />
So... has anyone found out how to start these? At first the rumour was 2 wins at any camp... then it was 2 wins at each camp... now its 10 wins... and there are people saying its just 2 wins at a single camp again.<br />
<br />
We were pretty much in &quot;go and explore&quot; mode last week, but I know we'll want to give em a shot this week...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sivok Kovis</div><div class="date">09-15-2003, 01:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">2 wins per is what I heard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sarsippius</div><div class="date">09-15-2003, 06:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">2 wins at camp of raid needed to start as well as to talk to the lore dude after 2nd win.  after raid is initiated form up outside of zone in and use invis to get in and secure camp site.  our first raid it took us an hour to break in the zone....it is very hard.  at MM, 75% of the raid mobs werent mezzable, all had nutso high MR, and super huge agro radius.  All mobs hit for over 1k and were pulled in lumps of 3+ at best.  <br />
<br />
We had the most success using bard lull to pull, but once we got it figured out and started to make way, the adventure shut down and timed out when it hit 60 minutes to go and said we hadn't progressed far enough.  We had 20 elemental geared people, and it was rough...i suggest using the full 36 allowed.  Was fun though....kinda like the first raid to Fear.  Good luck...we have to wait 5 days to try again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">09-15-2003, 08:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Has anyone tried a raid with pre-elemental geared people? Does it scale down for non-ubers to be able to raid? I know my guild tried a 36-man raid on Mistemoore on the hard setting and I understand it was hard as hell, but I wasn't there.<br />
<br />
Is there any hope of putting together 18-man pick up raids?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brudal the Fat</div><div class="date">09-16-2003, 11:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I read there are no &quot;Hard/Normal&quot; settings for raids. Its just a raid. Also I read that there are 3 types of raids, VT, Elemental, Time difficulty.<br />
<br />
Not tried a raid yet so don't quote me, just posting the things I have read. Maybe the raid looks at your flags, i.e if no elemental flags then raid is set to VT difficulty, if Elemental flag set to EP difficulty and if Time flag set at the hardest difficulty. Just a guess on my part though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Splaktar</div><div class="date">09-16-2003, 11:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hrm, I've seen people post that you don't need any wins... strange... maybe only the raid leader needs 2 wins?<br />
<br />
Cause another guy posted that he brought in people who had 0 wins at all in LDoN and they were in his raid just fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Coray</div><div class="date">09-16-2003, 12:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">don't need any wins, anyone in the raid, to do them.  Various sony things indicate otherwise but done a number without having ever done that theme, and I was the raid leader.<br />
<br />
*edit*<br />
<br />
also raids are set difficulty, flags, etc don't matter at all, and I've heard even the risk setting doesn't change anything which appears atleast from my few runs to be true. <br />
<br />
One of the biggest issues so far is that you have no clue what the difficulty is going to be and generally speaking, you don't know what you have to do once you start.  We did one last night and although we eventually failed because too many people died, we had no clue what we were really supposed to be doing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Korlis</div><div class="date">09-16-2003, 03:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We are aguild that is pre-elemental sitting in VT atm. We tried the raid the other day with 24 and same as described above. All mobs con even or yellow from what i saw, hit for 1k+ and very resistant. I noticed very high riposte rates also and used 2hs to offtank was alot less dmg taken. Our raid timed out also after about 60min (we think too many died).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Splaktar</div><div class="date">09-20-2003, 02:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We've tried raiding LDoN about 5x or so now and have never even got close to being successful with anything.  A couple times we couldn't even get the raid started.  Our best attempt so far we 'break the zone in area'... with a few deaths, and some people falling off... people started looking around and training us... we killed a bunch, but people were dying some... maybe 8-10 died.. and we got kicked out of zone w/ a fail... and all rares/named/bosses despawned.  We thought the limit was like 18, but I guess it was much lower...<br />
<br />
This was in Mir.<br />
<br />
We've been raiding other stuff, got our 2nd Quarm tonight... prolly concentrate more on LDoN in the comming weeks... still seems like quite a pain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Splaktar</div><div class="date">09-21-2003, 11:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Finished one raid now in about 5 tries.<br />
<br />
You can only do each raid once per 5 days, this is on a per-char basis. <br />
<br />
Some more info can be found in Overlord's Section, as all my info is for lvl 65 raids for Time/Elemental guilds, etc.</div></div><hr />
