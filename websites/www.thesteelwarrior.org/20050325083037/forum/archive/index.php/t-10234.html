<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">01-10-2005, 05:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Running through the trials with guildies to get them (and myself) flagged and we flew through trial 1 in an hour and started trial 2. Collected the 4 skulls, fought to the Furnace and the 4 ghosts spawned. We slaughtered them and watched the pink wisps go out the room toward the Blue Crystal Room. We then evacuated to zone in and invised/pacified to the Blue Crystal room and got there with about 7 minutes to spare on the 30 minute timer.<br />
<br />
The only problem was 2 of the wisps were on the alter and the other 2 were no where to be seen. They showed up on track so we started looking through walls and found them under the world. Since they were under the world the hand in NPC didnt spawn to hand the skulls to. We tried /targeting them (which worked) but could not taunt them, cast on them, attack them, or anything to try and pull them out. 7 minutes went by and we never got a fail message that we took too long.<br />
<br />
I ended up having to go and so the group brought in another guildie and they exited the exp and started over. I came back later and they had petitioned and a GM came and flat out said he couldn't help and if we felt it wasn't working as intended we should /bug it. Well duh it's not working as intended. They tried 2 more times and same thing each time once they got to the blue crystal room.<br />
<br />
So now we have a couple sets of these skulls for future runs, but it's very frustrating because we want to get Kod`Taz access and having a bugged sewer trial isn't helping.<br />
<br />
Anyone else run into this problem?  :(</div></div><hr />

She isn't that bad now, infact clearing to her is probably worse than her.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Soulcoughing</div><div class="date">01-10-2005, 09:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">you cannot evac after spawn the wisps or that blows the mission.  Also cannot go into the blue crystal room before spawning the wisps.  Easiest is to bring a SoS rogue with all the skulls to run by themselves after spawning last one.  Can also use a really bored mage and park them at the safespot at the crossroads area to coth everyone once ya spawn them all.<br />
<br />
I recomend the rogue simply since it will be faster to flag a rogue for sewer 1 and 2 then it will be to clear all the way back to end of sewer 3 but that is just my feelings</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Antaran</div><div class="date">01-10-2005, 11:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Regarding the bug or not, sewer 2 has not posed problems for me recently with one exception.  We got to the crystal room well withing 30 minutes but the NPC poofed as soon as I hailed him and started handing in last skull....after that try I did not take any chances and took care of the hand in by other means.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Roanne Lefaye</div><div class="date">01-11-2005, 07:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had basically the same bug a few weeks back. We did the mage CoH at crossroads safespot thing and had only 1 wisp on the alter when we got there and the rest under the word. Ranger in the group said the turn in named did spawn, but stayed up less than 5 mins before disappearing and we never received the 15 min warning zone message nor fail message. I submitted a /bug then as well.<br />
<br />
I havent tried this trial again since then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Menon</div><div class="date">01-11-2005, 08:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've run through this trial multiple times for myself and guildies, and found it to be the most bugged of all of them.  I have about a 50% rate of failing due to a bug.  Sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn't.<br />
<br />
Also, the skulls you saved will not work in future trials.  You'll want to destroy them and collect new ones.<br />
<br />
What are the sewers needed for now anyway?  I thought tipt was enough to get you into KT since the patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Futumsh</div><div class="date">01-11-2005, 11:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Skulls from previous trials do work - just you need someone that doesn't have the flag to have 4 skulls on them to spawn the nameds.  I often collect skulls with my rogue in xp only versions for flagging other people later on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">01-11-2005, 11:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I haven't heard anything about Tipt being the only zone you need to get into KT, that would make the other 5 zones pretty silly to have around.<br />
<br />
I will try trial 2 again without succoring, but my try bringing a mage if we don't have the dps to fight back.</div></div><hr />
