<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>anarke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey there my brother has been playing everquest for a little while now and now that he is 50+ i thought i'd throw him a whole new set of gear, i would link you his magelo but its pretty much all noob stuff once you get to the upper/high end so basically im looking for a full suit of stuff money is not really a problem I can easily make 100k a day. So basically would like help creating a quite nice set of gear with HP's/AC king obviouisly id like to pay 1000k for it all at most. Ornate/Magnetic etc. all an option</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">OK, heres the ultimate reasonable bazaar twink list imo. <br />
<br />
Ear: iron cog earring<br />
Ear:  bloodmetal earring of engagement<br />
Neck: serpentine necklace<br />
Face: mask of flourishing fungus / thulian visage of horror / amygdalan chain mask<br />
Head: helmet of rallos zek<br />
Fingers: steel ring of earthen resililience<br />
hands: ornate<br />
legs: ornate<br />
chest: ornate<br />
arms: dried clay armguards, ornate, magnetic, you pick<br />
wrist: crystallized acid bracer<br />
wrist: mana-threaded bone bracer<br />
shoulder: horn spiked pauldrons<br />
back: tainted cloak of treachery<br />
waist: soulscream belt, spiked seahorse hide belt (haste)<br />
feet: bloodied boots of dark rites<br />
primary: blade of carnage<br />
secondary: sceptre of destruction / sword of midwinters vengeance / bygone butchers cleaver / copper hammer of strike<br />
<br />
You're probably already looking at over 1m pp there but thats a damn nicely equipped level 65 bazaar toon, let alone a level 50. You might improve a few of the non-visable stuff with new oow attuneable stuff if you want to lose the ability to resell the items, too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>anarke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">thanks for the quick reply and its good to see someone else from drinal ive seen you around bardeil my main is aazzaari a 65 druid word to UF and drinal ;)<br />
<br />
EDIT: i just updated the magelo with the given gear http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1132003 is the link, raw hp's ~4100 raw ac ~1300, which would bring hp's to around 6200 fully buffed. How long can I expect this gear last? As in am I going to be upgrading him again at 65 because he can't even tank elemental planes etc. Also didn't add any augs as cheap as the +12 augs are now i could easily sacrifice portion of stat gear for more raw ac/hp, imo 1300 ac looks weak and 4100 raw's hp may be a tad low but let me know thanks :)<br />
<br />
EDIT 2: I realize the warrior is only level 52 and some of the gear may have req levels such as needed 55 for ornate or the flag but he will be up in no time was just 35 a couple days ago and I checked the HP's at 65 w/ exact same gear would be around 5200 unbuffed which is a lot better</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Atkins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I would also not neglect dex as it seems to give me a feel of more proccing with it at 200+ unbuffed as compared to when i had dex at 130.  Ogre dex is not all that great.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">That gear is about as good as can be bought and resold. Many of the pieces are better than what I'm wearing and I can tank eplains easily. He could tank eplains, hard ldons, some GoD/ OOW stuff with it. Apolyon posted a newer magelo with the new attuneable stuff in it, but it's 65 required and couldn't be resold so I wouldn't go with that stuff personally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Range: get a stonewood compound bow, too. Forgot that one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Spockmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">stonewood is req lvl 61, he should wait on that till he gets there maybe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nazgrub</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Is attuneable stuff out of the question?  If it isn't, there are quite a few attuneable items that are better than what is listed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Spockmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">attuneable would work too, cept its a total loss of pp since it turns no drop after equip.</div></div><hr />

That gear is great. Take the magelo and add in HP aa's as well as 65 to get a true view of how the gear stacks up. I think you'll be pleasently surprised.<br />
<br />
I personally used almost that exact gear as a  base to tank for my group of friends (not guilded) from hard LDoN, through Ikkinz, and now into Riftseekers where I've been upgrading it to no drop gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gaspie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">attuneable would work too, cept its a total loss of pp since it turns no drop after equip. So does ornate. Go go Charged Magnetic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Spockmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">So does ornate. Go go Charged Magnetic.<br />
<br />
so it does, although id still rather have the ornate BP over the magnetic one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is correct, all magnetic stuff is Attuneable, so it is virtually same as buying ornate.</div></div><hr />
