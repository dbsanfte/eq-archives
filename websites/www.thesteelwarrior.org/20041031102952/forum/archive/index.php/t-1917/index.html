<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Meanfred</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello everyone, I am Meanfred, Level 54 Champion of the Xev server, well I have 50k now, saved up finally after so long of saving, I am wondering what I should upgrade I will give you a list of some of my stuff I want to upgrade and I want only the people who know about what the good gear is to tell me what &quot;I&quot; want.<br />
<br />
Primary: Serrated Cutlass of Hatred<br />
Secondary: Defenders Lightblade<br />
Head: Helm of Raldukan<br />
Waist: RBB<br />
Chest: Barbed Ringmail<br />
<br />
Ok these are the slots I think I might need an upgrade in, I know for one being level 54 about to be 55, I will soon be 60, because I level fast, and I have been told many times, I need Aggro procing weapons, and I am wondering if I should upgrade weapons or maybe some of the other slots, here is a list of possible upgrades I want to do, please somone tell me what the best thing to do with 50k is.<br />
<br />
Upgrade:<br />
Primary: Fleshgrinder<br />
Head: Helmet of Ralloz Zek<br />
Waist: Spikes Seahorse Hide Belt<br />
Chest: Iron Breastplate of the Demented<br />
<br />
Please somone tell me what to upgrade out of those, or what is your opinion on what I should do (IE: Flip my money into 80-100k maybe by selling in bazaar and save for another item maybe?)  So please any Overlords who know how to play please feel free to give me your suggestions because I worked hard to make my 50k which may not seem much to you guys, but it is to me, Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Daabu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Not sure what Rallos Zek helmet goes for on your server, but on mine its sitting right around 200k...if thats in reach for you, its a very nice upgrade.<br />
<br />
That being said, though, many times your goal would probably be more to get a decent weapon, just because without aggro, all the hp in the world wont mean anything.  Fleshgrinder is about the best hate-producing weapon you can buy, shord of a Blade of Carnage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Smakz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">fleshgrinder about sucks a nut for aggro, its pure DPS, thats it ... <br />
<br />
even though i hate the weapon with the bowels of my soul, i cant ignore it .... Buy a Greatstaff of Thunder, its the best aggro weapon you can get for your price range.<br />
<br />
or, if you like Dual weilding, Pick up a Frostbringer, and look into one of those new weapons comming out of Droga or Chardok B, they will be selling cheap, but get em while you can, when the zone drops, they wont be cheap anymore.<br />
<br />
RBB is more than adaquate for a non-Ssra+ warrior, i would keep that right where it is, on your waist.<br />
<br />
Looking at a Helm of Rallos, with only 50k to toss around is kind of pointless, as you might be able to buy a few rivets off of it.  Your helm of Radulkan is fine for now.<br />
<br />
Your Breastplate however needs some work.  Look into MQing a Thurgadin chestplate, or take a few friends and sit in Kael Arena for a while, till you get one to drop for you.  Or look into getting into a Plane of Growth raid, and pick up a Berzerkers.  There are a few nice BPs dropping in Umbral Plains that are single groupable also (Moktor BP, 35ac 15agi/stam/str 15hp ... and Radulkan Breastplate, which is 46ac 100hp, and a few other stats i cant remember).<br />
<br />
and most importantly is levels, that should be your primary concern right now ... when you hit 60/61 then you should start worrying about gear a little more.</div></div><hr />
