There maybe some other instances where it doest get the mob fully pissed at you.  I can't recall any others.  The closest thing to a 100% taunt we have.</div></div><hr />

For example when you get summoned on a mob you always appear in the same area, which is where the mob is, as far as the game is concerned.  Many mobs, especially ubers, have a melee radius that's much bigger than the AE taunt range.<br />
<br />
So you can hit AE taunt and not be in range of where the mob actually is and fail.  There's also Z-axis issues, i.e. where the game considers the mob to be is too high for your AE Taunt to reach.</div></div><hr />

I suppose this is one of those bugs that has been around forever and not given to SoE to fix then?<br />
<br />
btw...appreciate the info on z-axis too, I suppose dragons could give z-axis and range issues.</div></div><hr />

IIRC that's why they lowered it, but now it doesn't work on some really tall mobs like Fennin Ro, Rallos Zek, or the Avatar of War.<br />

Levi usually fixes it as others have said.</div></div><hr />

This serves as a backdrop for paying attention to the range of it and your surroundings.<br />

The Hole math:  x mobs + AE Taunt = 2x mobs</div></div><hr />

I still recall tanking the shade in PoN and he summoned me into a tree about 50 feet off the ground while the mob was still at ground level...it made it a little difficult to get oriented and retain agro...but I'm wondering if we could ask the developers to look into making AET somewhat variable due to a mob's melee range and size...not to mention it would be nice to have a success / failure message indicating whether or not any mob (or which mobs) were affected by the AET.  I suppose it would be asking too much for AET to be reset if it fails to taunt any mobs.</div></div><hr />
