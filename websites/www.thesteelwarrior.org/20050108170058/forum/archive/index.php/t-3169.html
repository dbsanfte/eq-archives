<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">doncanaidaho</div><div class="date">09-20-2003, 10:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well my main is a 65 monkey (VT equipped and some solro) and I have a 65 druid bot.  I just made a war and used my druid bot to pl him to 25 and then worked on my skills with him blah blah blah yeah yeah... <br />
<br />
Ok so... he is still in full crusty,  and I just wanted to know if you guys knew some camps (or quests) I could do to get him some better equip.  I know some and I've already camped him both copper hammer of striking and sword of the bloodsworn but now I don't know whatelse?  I was in the grey last night farming shissar organs for when he hits 39 and can get the amulet of the grey wastes and I came apon a shissar scale headband so that was cool... I guess Im kinda looking for stuff like that.  I could care less about how long the camp takes, as long as a nicely equipped monk and druid could do it.  <br />
<br />
(I've already gotten him 3 pieces of the SoE quest, just need the piece from the hole to finish it)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dovan</div><div class="date">09-20-2003, 10:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Depending on diety, you might wanna look into racial, especially if he's either rallos zek or tribunal aligned.<br />
<br />
Could get'um up to 46 and drop xamamech for haste item, only takes 10 or so where you're sitting.<br />
<br />
Might look at some of the kunzar helm out of veksar, along with the kylong legs there.<br />
<br />
Magelo link on this guy would be a lot of help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">doncanaidaho</div><div class="date">09-20-2003, 10:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess I could make a magelo but he is simply in full crusty with 2 velium fire wedding rings and 2 black sapphire electrum earrings<br />
<br />
EDIT:  Oh and he is rallos zek follower and I currently have the pieces to make him fierce heraldic but a human GM smith on drinal is rare.. infact I think there are 2 and one already turned me down cause hes &quot;retired&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dovan</div><div class="date">09-20-2003, 11:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh I promise there's gonna be more than 2 out there, the Aid quest series changed a lot to GM smith.<br />
<br />
I looked at Druzzil area on eqtraders...  might look up either Pzing or Scirocco, both these people are human druids that are max in all skills.<br />
<br />
Rings, snag some valorium for the time being, they ain't bad and getting ML is pie, that or buy'um cheap.  Bloodmetal earrings are nice, just depends if ya wanna spend time in tactics farming piggah/pit area.<br />
<br />
Heavy Rubicite Girdle's are cheap, and if ya go in to farm them, get an Amyaglam chain mask.  You can as well snag in that area as well, lizard earrings.  If you're really into self abuse, do grid in CT for mosquite earrings and FT boots (for resale of more gear).<br />
<br />
But seriously, can't stress... ya lucked out having RZ as diety.  Make sure ya take full advantage of that when you can, ie armor and idol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">doncanaidaho</div><div class="date">09-20-2003, 11:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the tips bro =D  I'm actually on drinal so I'll try and look up some GM smiths up.  I was thinking about the moquito leg earring I'll look into that and the valorium rings I wouldn't really want till they give near the hp as velium fire wedding but I can farm the parts rather easily.  OH and I already did the cloak of greater pernicity quest for him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dovan</div><div class="date">09-20-2003, 11:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry bout that... those names ARE from Drinal's board area on eqtraders.  Some reason I had druzzil on the mind.<br />
<br />
But those are DRINAL smith names.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dovan</div><div class="date">09-20-2003, 11:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also uncoded some names off that mess they call html.<br />
<br />
Human GM Smiths on Drinal-<br />
<br />
KiRahann TyRann<br />
Monual<br />
Trewayn<br />
Pzing<br />
Scirocco</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">doncanaidaho</div><div class="date">09-20-2003, 11:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">aye thank you very much for your help.  I got ahold of scirocco and he said he would help me out.  Turns out he has maxed all tradeskills and all AA's lol =D<br />
<br />
Thanks again</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">09-21-2003, 08:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">keep your little guy in the crustacean armour until the FH armor comes to age on him ( i think around 40 it's at like 80% statwise ) ...<br />
<br />
hell; after that might want to LDoN equip him; some of that architect stuff ( mentioned here somewhere ) is pretty decent too</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">doncanaidaho</div><div class="date">09-22-2003, 12:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah I hear ya.  Though FH gear doesn't have the greatest stats around lvl 25, its still better then crusty.  I'm ready to make the gear now so might as well.<br />
<br />
Also another camp I have been working on for him is clattering bone neck.  So far I have gotten the druid scimitar twice.  Also was thinking I could check Va'Dyn every once in a while for a chance to get him shaderock amulet.</div></div><hr />
