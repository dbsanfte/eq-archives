None in my search have show the max regen with items and aa's<br />
now possible with GOD expansion.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know what total worn regen cap is worn (plus self aa's) sitting / or standing?<br />
<br />
Anyone that has a good breakdown on this would be much appreciated.</div></div><hr />

Thats just items.  It doesn't include any AA or the sitting bonus, but you can figure those out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SincroFashad</div><div class="date">07-06-2004, 03:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For a lvl 65 dark elf you can have:<br />
35 worn<br />
3 from general AA<br />
3 from archetype AA<br />
2 GoD AA<br />
9 innate standing /or/<br />
12 innate sitting<br />
<br />
For a total regen, unbuffed, of 50 standing, 53 sitting.  For rogues/warriors/berserkers who aren't a troll or an iksar, those numbers should be good.  Iksar and Trolls have innate bonuses to regen, and monks have their own bonuses iirc.<br />
<br />
Also, new coding changes theoretically put in place to help with melee downtime has drastically increased the innate sitting regen numbers.  Basically, every conscutive minute you stay sitting, your innate regen gets a bump.  When I tested it when it first came out, the final few ticks before I got to full health were in the 120 hp/tick range.  The new sitting regen does not work if you are dotted, although staying seated *does* increment your timer so if you're still sitting 10 minutes later when the DoT wears off, you'll immediately start regenning at an extreme rate.</div></div><hr />
