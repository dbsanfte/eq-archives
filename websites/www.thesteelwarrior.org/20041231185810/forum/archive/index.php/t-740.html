<br />
Let me start this out by saying I HATE VERANT! Had some odd problems move logging to legends for a month to do some trading and such, originaly from innoruuk, but when my 30 days were up, i got moved back to torv....i do not understand what happend at all and the GM's and tech support are claiming they have no clue what happend and that my records are messed up, but wont move me back :mad:  :mad: <br />
<br />
So what the thing is is....i know nothing about the server...whose the big uber guild, what are some good raiding guilds that could use a 60 ogre warrior and such, and basicly anything i should know about the server? any info would be appreciated, i been arguing with VI for 2 weeks and since it looks like im gonna be becoming a permamant resident of of torv (which isnt necissarily a bad thing...) any info would be helpful thanks :)<br />

Blades of Wrath is resident uber guild, followed by Monolith, then Nexxus of Faith (European guild) then Immortals Rising. There are guilds recruiting and stuff on the Torv boards, so check them out and see what fits.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The above poster is correct as far as the Uber guilds.<br />
<br />
The only thing I would add about Torvo is if you read the various posts here about items and what they normally cost, add about 3-4k and thats the low end on Torvo. :)</div></div><hr />

Welcome to Torvo.<br />
<br />
Top Guilds are as listed. <br />
<br />
There are a bunch that are in the high-50 low 60 range. <br />
<br />
Poke around the Torv board at http://pub173.ezboard.com/btorvboard in the recruiting section to see who is recruiting these days.</div></div><hr />
