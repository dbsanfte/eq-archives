Was fighting RD in HoH trial and was MA.  I guess i got quickly feared at start.  Didn't notice.  Had not heard about this bug where you can't attack after being feared.  I was told after we wiped that you need to lose target and re-acquire before you can attack again.  Anyone seen this?  Is it just on RD?  Or other fearing mobs as well.  I have been feared a billion times and not seen this.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valeris</div><div class="date">11-02-2003, 07:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've had occasional bugs like that occur on normal mobs. You have em targetted, you attack and nothing, not even miss or out of range messages. Clearing your target and retargetting seems to be the best/only way to overcome it - I've not tried it but to save difficulty with mouse targetting you might want to clear the target box then hit the 'switch to last target' hotkey to reacquire. In the middle of a fight it may save some problems.</div></div><hr />

No need to retarget.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hittem</div><div class="date">11-02-2003, 11:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is a sucky bug.  Please /bug it and bitch to any coder's ear who can hear you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">czai</div><div class="date">11-02-2003, 03:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This has happened to me.  Was tanking a charm bird in Fire, got charmed then mezzed, when I popped out of it I couldn't attack, taunts didnt seem to work, and I was completely wiped off the aggro list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lakashu</div><div class="date">11-02-2003, 09:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Didnt help any that Brell's server went down right after that wipe either so was no chance for Hittem to redeem himself.<br />
<br />
Fortunately Hittem is well known and respected so no harm done to him.<br />

(My wizard was with ya on that one)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draganetti</div><div class="date">11-03-2003, 01:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, the main problems that i've seen happen when you get mezed (by a friend) while you are charmed (by an npc).  This happens alot at the birds in PoFire as the above posters stated.  As long as you aren't mezed when the charm breaks, i think you are ok.  Best bet is just to have someone offtank you instead of mez.  :P  PC's do crappy damage when charmed anyways.<br />
<br />
I've never really had that problem from a fear, but fear has always seemed rather buggy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">niin</div><div class="date">11-03-2003, 01:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It happens even if you're just charmed.  I think it's any time you lose control of your char (anything that will throw the LD tag next to your name even tho you're still connected, like charm or fear); folks report the same bug with Rydda'Dar's fear.</div></div><hr />
