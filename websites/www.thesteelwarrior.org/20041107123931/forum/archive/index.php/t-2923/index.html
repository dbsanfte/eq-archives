<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Marshall</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">..you can do /feedback in game. We need to convey it to Sony that the game is seriously out of balance. /feedback today explaining the aggro problem of warriors and the imbalance wrt knights. Do it with any other accounts you have as well. Tell your guildies to do it too. Too long have we all waited in silence, don't you think?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wyloc Wormwood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">silence?? your kiddin right? <br />
i personaly do /feedback everyday (upto 2-3 a day now) as im sure almost every pure melee are doing. do they give a fuck? bollox do they, they come off the printer...through the shedder... into the hamster cage.<br />
take a step back and look at the game for a min guys.<br />
pure melee are NOT needed. they keep fobbing us off with the same message in future plans (only changing the typeface and making it smaller lol to look different)  yes it will take a lot of work (takes even more each fucking upgrade you give to casters btw) but we see no feedback or anyone with a fuckin clue poping over the forums with &quot;guys its taking a while but your really gonna like this, heres a few examples of what ya gonna get to fix the sorry ass of melee (and it wont be mana and a spellbook) it'll be good so hang in there&quot;<br />
no we get Alan &quot;i talk shit cos they dont tell me fuck all&quot; Absor comming over and saying &quot;classes are not that out of balance&quot;<br />
<br />
fuckin bollox:mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Here's a hint.<br />
<br />
Sony loves $$. You want something from Sony.<br />
<br />
BOYCOTT LDON. SHOW SONY YOU WANT SOMETHING DONE.<br />
<br />
That is all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">feedback would work, whining on class boards doesnt do shit(but its still fun)<br />
