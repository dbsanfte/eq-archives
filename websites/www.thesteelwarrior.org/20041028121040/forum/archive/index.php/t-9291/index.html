<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am an ac whore and i'm aiming as high as possible (3K is realistic nowdays).<br />
<br />
This however requires me finding 3 augments :<br />
<br />
- Ground Murkglinder Eyes (I have heard MPG not confirmed)<br />
- Ore of Stone Strength (Riftseekers, Lower floor, Named Griplan near Feratha)<br />
- Flamshield Stone (Unable to locate this one)<br />
<br />
I've seen many people with these augments on other server.<br />
But mine is deserted, and people want to farm the 70hp.<br />
There are at most 1-3 groups in rift (none at primetime, only outside raids)<br />
<br />
So i'm having a hard time convincing groups to just &quot;move around&quot;<br />
specially since the 70hp camp is almost always open.<br />
<br />
Would anyone with these 2 augments mind sharing some info ?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

Warclasp Ring is his common drop, aug is rare. Killed him more than 10 times, saw only 1 aug so far.<br />
<br />
Hope it helps</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aonodorus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">just clear out the room that says riftseeker on the eq-toolbox maps.  you'll see alot more of the other named that spawns there and drops the gimp ass chain bracer, but occasionally you'll get a riftseeker.</div></div><hr />

Oh, if 65hp aug (Gleaming stone of Ferocity) Drops off the named dog (Prefected Companion) next to Tanomari, along with a greater rune all our times we killed it</div></div><hr />

I went looking last evening and only was able to find a Girplan Stonesinger who dropped a shoulder item on both kills.<br />

Thank you.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Lidan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I was in MPG on my beast the other day and I was at the Taskfiend and Blindhunter Camp.  Its between the two.  The Blind Hunter spawned for us 3 times in 4 hours and the Taskfiend didn't spawn for us at all.  Hunter dropped 1 AC aug (gratz cleric) and two of the earrings (gratz me and shadow knight) so atleast the SK got something out of it.  This was just a pick up group I put together.  The map I have has the two mobs marked.  Plus, you can pull lightning guys to get lightning cores, which sell pretty well on TT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Dima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Hunter dropped 1 AC aug (gratz cleric) on TT.<br />
<br />
Your cleric is a goddamn retard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Bulbog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">If you clear up a bit further you can clear the taskfiend, blind hunter and named ikaav PH's by running back and forth.  The named ikaav drops a 55 hp aug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Sarrasis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Your cleric is a goddamn retard.<br />
heh, I was in a guild group where a friggin monk almost won that AC aug over me.  I had to explain to him that AC does jack shit for them to let me loot it. <br />
<br />
Thanks for the info on the Perfected Companion btw.  Took a guild group there last night and camped it for a couple hours.  Got one named to pop and it dropped a nice BP (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=70299).  Bard bot looted since it really wasnt an upgrade for me or the cleric.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Pumilio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">yeah, north of it there's a choice of going north or east (to riftseekers) that mob directly north is a ph for odimate issie? somethingl like that, if you have a great group you can clear those, or if not so uber clear odimate, invis kill blind hunter ph and the taskfiend ph hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Fynepisa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">The 55HP aug from Oduimate also doesn't seem as rare as the AC aug off Blind Hunter. They have dropped about 1/3 of the time for my group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Lakor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I was in Riftseeker's room (25ac aug) from 11am to 4:30pm once, and only named we got was the Battlemaster which drops that quest thingy.<br />
<br />
I heard that a guildee had 3 of them drop within a few hours the day before. Boy, was I pissed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
During a primals raid a cleric won the random against me, thinking it was a joke I looted the blessed shard. Cleric wasn't happy but I probably would've given it up to him anyhow, I guess thinking it was a joke saved me 30ac =p</div></div><hr />

Trying to camp this, just want to make sure I'm in the right spot. This is a big round room with about 6 pyrilen's in it, and has a cubby on each side with more spawns?<br />
<br />
Can anyone tell me exactly which spot he spawns in?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Aonodorus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">riftseeker room in rs, had 5 riftseeker's in 2 spawn cycles, 4 ac augs :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Barraind</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">One night had 9 riftseekers and 8 bows.  Thats a pretty funny sight if you are the rest of the group.</div></div><hr />
