<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Thinking about doing this event and would like some info. I understand to spawn the acidic mass you need to kill a rooted placeholder but have not been able to find any info re this placeholder or where he is located. Can anyone shed some light.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jedediah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">He spawns in the camp we call Ooze alley, on RN.  Basically, come through the double doors, turn around, and go up the ladder.  Follow the hall down to the pool, and swim up into the tunnel that contains lots of oozes.  Go all the way to the end of that tunnel, and you'll see another pool.  In the back of that pool are 5 spawns.  The rooted PH pops every ~3 days, in the same spot as the mob in the middle of the pool, so if he's up, you'll see 2 mobs there.  Incidentally, once you kill the PH, that will spawn a new ooze (bubbling ooze?) which you can pull out of the pool.  Then he will spawn a new ooze (boiling ooze?), which will in turn pop the acidic mass, which is also perma-rooted, wherever he spawns.<br />

Good luck!</div></div><hr />

If you don't know.... those are the only good loots. Everything else pretty much sucks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Promethis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Head into the green pool with the oozes and kill the rooted PH.<br />
<br />
PH spawns bubbling ooze, hits for like 340, not slowable, not rooted.<br />
<br />
Bubbling ooze spawns boiling ooze on death, rooted (I think, been a while) hits for like 500, unslowable.<br />
<br />
Bubbling spawns Acidic Mass (rootable), slowable, 850-ish hitter, hella lot of hp.  Casts an AE stun thats easily resistable at 65.<br />
<br />
Least I've done him with was myself (war, duh!), cleric, cleric, ench, mage, wiz.  Took us like, 90 minutes or some shit.</div></div><hr />
