<br />
Also, if your corpse is right at the &quot;lightning portal&quot; (which you basically need to be to avoid aggroing the nearby mobs) it would be a good idea to /target Baadan's corpse and /loot rather than right click as you might get ported. ;)</div></div><hr />

Pull corpse as close as you can to you and inch up on it until you can loot it using /loot. Should be safe to res/loot there, and you have less worries about zoning into HoHa</div></div><hr />

Just don't go into his chamber, that's where the dogs see invis.</div></div><hr />

HoHa/b are fun because basically nothing sees invis so you can just run around a bunch with invis potions and even check if LMM is up.  Just don't go into his chamber, that's where the dogs see invis.  I discovered exactly this last night.. the hard way.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the responses and the looting tip Pag0.<br />
<br />
On another note, how hard are the 3 mobs at the zin?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baadan</div><div class="date">12-23-2003, 04:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got in there.. and one corpse was missing. The corpse that was at the GY was naked.<br />
<br />
I scrambled to find a willing and flagged Cleric and got one, but they arrived literally seconds too late to rez that corpse. Now that there was no reason not to loot that corpse (previously I had worried whether or not that corpse had gear on it, and was just graphically bugged and not displaying it as happens sometimes... but, if that corpse actually didn't have gear and I tried to loot it, that would cause it to poof and in my previous dealings with GMs, the corpse must still exist for exp to be replaced) I looted it after dragging it to a safer spot and to my surprise, it had my gear. I looted it all except for my arrows which I left so that there would be a corpse in case the GM needed that.<br />
<br />
The real problem here is that when I got disconnected last night, there was over 2:30 left on the rez timer, but when I logged on, one corpse had poofed and the other only have 45 minutes remaining. I was robbed of ~2 hours of CR time. I petitioned and got no reponse. I saw an actual GM on, but they seemed only to be on to promote a guide from level 20 to 50. I sent an email through the website so hopefully I can get somewhere through that.</div></div><hr />

They'll still contain all gear/items, just won't show it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">12-24-2003, 05:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The mobs in HoHB are pretty standard for their cons, minus the Wrulons in Marr's room.  The yellow cons are roughly comparable to the average LDoN normal assassination boss though their HPs are probably higher (and DPS probably a bit lower).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pag0</div><div class="date">12-24-2003, 10:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Badaan, I've also noticed that res timer problem recently. Especially with all of the emergency patchs, it seems they are not turning off res timers at all during the patchs. Hopefully this is a bug that they will fix.<br />
<br />
Good luck in getting the missing corpse and exp back on your other one.<br />
<br />
I am sure an exp group could kill the 3 wrulons at the zone in, but haven't tried it yet, so might take that with a grain of salt.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you loot everything on your corpse accidently (who hasn't!) but you have not yet stood up, (ie, you're still in loot mode even though you have looted all the gear) simply stay down.  Within a few minutes, a timer runs out and you stand automatically.  But your rezzable corpse will remain.<br />
<br />
I found this out accidently with my necro. You can also /q out and leave a naked rezzable corpse also.</div></div><hr />
