I'm in the process of building a new system, but it's not going to be to play EQ on.  I find it revolting that the machine I have been running the game on for 4 years will no longer run it because some assclowns decided they needed new textures.  Fuck EQ, that's the last goddamned straw.<br />
<br />
There was nothing wrong with the engine or the models, or the animations or anything, there was no reason to fuck with it other than to try to make it look good in the abscence of gameplay.  If the game kicked ass, people would play it if it was black and white stick figures.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I agree, the change wasn't necessary.<br />
<br />
However, it's normal to have to upgrade computer hardware to continue to play games and keep current with technology.  In this case the most you should have to do is throw a few bucks into a new video card, a sub $50 GeForce MX440 should do nicely.<br />

<br />
Either of those should run the new engine just fine...  but don't expect them to run EQ2 or WoW well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't argue that, for new games.<br />
<br />
It's completely unreasonable in my eyes to tell me that I spent money on the game, all expansions, and a monthly fee, and now it's all worthless because the computer I started playing the game with doesn't run the game anymore.  If I want to, I can still install Duke Nukem and go blast some aliens for awhile.  EQ cd's will sit in my desk for years, and it doesn't matter...can't play em.  Crock of crap if you ask me.</div></div><hr />

I play on a 3 year old laptop, one right before they started putting Radeons in them as my wife's is 8 months newer and thats what shes running. Intel card was working just fine in most zones, laggy in bazaar, pok, GoD and zones with alot of trees. <br />
<br />
This is the last straw for me. It ticks me off too that they had to do this, when 1/2 the game is still crappy mob graphics, whats the freakin point. Especially with EQ2 around the corner....good freakin luck to the poor souls that wander over to that dead horse.<br />
<br />
In a way, this is a blessing in disguise. I've grown rapidly weary of all the bugs and issues in the game that its no longer as enjoyable as it was before.  As it is, a little time off for now, and if I decide to buy a new system, I'm heading over to Blizzard for WoW. I love those guys, and have never had a complaint with them.</div></div><hr />

EXACTLY.<br />
<br />
Broke 2 of my comps and this one is just barely limping along on it.  I don't have the goddamn cash to fork over for a better machine to run some putz's idea of &quot;better colors/textures.&quot;<br />
<br />
I canceled one account since there's no point to playing it any longer since I can't 2box.<br />
<br />
I have np with upgrading my machine before WoW or another game but this was a lot sooner than I wanted to upgrade it.<br />
<br />
SoE would be better served looking at their piss poor customer service than upgrading shit that doesn't need to be upgraded.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I logged on for a short time just to check and noticed no adverse effects, but at the same time noticed no improvements. Some people had their graphics totally fuxed, others claim improvements in clarity and speed. For reference, I am on a 1.5GHz, 512ram, 128mb GeForce MX 5600 Ultra system.</div></div><hr />

3Ghz P4, 1Gig Ram, ATI 9800 Pro. I did notice it played a little smoother, but that could have just been because of the lighter server load since it sounds like a good chunk of people can't play anymore.</div></div><hr />

What the fuck is your point?<br />
<br />
The one problem I had with EQ until today was the utter lack of GMs addressing player problems.  Today I get stuck on every tiny bit of geometry, on walls in VT, stumbling over nonexistent bumps in PoE, the lag is horrendous and my other box is effectively rendered useless. <br />
<br />
All I do is whine, bitch and moan about the game?  I haven't had a prob with this game besides customer service since they added incite to the warrior class and I *certainly* don't go around whining on message boards in every post I make, or whining about people whining.  I have every right to point out the shortcomings of dx9 without being jumped on by some retard with a liplock on SoE's left nut.  The squeaky wheel gets the grease.  If you don't like it, don't read it.</div></div><hr />

Nice of sony to change EQ so that only people with a 2.5 Ghz + machines notice any benefits, people with 1.5 Ghz - 2.5 Ghz probably are running about the same and people with less are SoL.<br />
<br />
It seems like their list of fixes keeps getting longer, and the time it takes for them to actually get to them grows longer as well. Maybe its time for them to halt all upgrades and expansions and fix the shit that is wrong with the current game. What happened for example to the Melee Disc ability upgrade? Also has anyone here played a Berserker? They got so many things wrong with them I reallly dont understand the point of that class. Anyway, looks like they have to add a way to allow the older PC's to play now or chance losing half their customer base.<br />

In case you didn't notice, there was this exact same problem during Luclin.  Anyone who wasn't running a top of the line system had to upgrade.  I'm growing weary of this upgrading my system to PLAY THE SAME FUCKING GAME.  I don't give a shit about games of the future, I haven't paid for those.

<br />
Unfortunately this problem isn't about games of the future.  This is about a game of the past that is no longer playable because SoE felt like implementing an unnecessary change, thus leaving a portion of their player base with the choice of either a) spend more money on top of the hundreds of dollars spent over the years for this game just so they can play the same game again, or b) flush years of work and time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Haass got it right; but I guess it's like everything else in the world; either shit or get off the pot.<br />
<br />
If that what it takes to play EQ; than that' what it takes. It's wrong that people need to have the top of the line equip ( not just drivers and stupid krap ) upgraded quarterly or twice a year just to play the same damn game with maybe some new flashing lights that no one really noticed nor cared about it's implementing. But, eh, it's their game. I got the power to stop playing it if it comesdown to needing another $1000 rig is needed to play the same damn game and if enough people share the same views about leaving it and their (SoE) $$ profits drop enough; maybe they'll get the hint that no one gives a flying rats ass about twinkling stars and puffier clouds.<br />
<br />
Time will tell. There's just too many people who still live at home and/or have the funds to throw the dollars at upgrading their rigs whenever they want to to not turn the tide to force the point that no matter what the flashing lights and whstles do; the game is STILL THE SAME and needless upgrading and elimination of entire companies of previously supported hardware like a prom dress is wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Shaiel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">For the majority of players out there, the new graphics engine was an improvement over the old (and a vast improvement at that).  The players that get screwed are those using 5 year old video cards or got crappy parts to begin with (ie, crappy onboard video cards).  SOE is assuming that if you can't afford a 40$ video card, you can't afford a subscription for the next 6 months.  It's really not much to ask people to have at least a GeForce2, and they gave quite a bit of warning to those without Dx9 compliant cards.<br />
<br />
And whoever said something about the new graphics engine and server lag somehow being related has no idea what they're talking about... your connection has absolutely nothing to do with your framerate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">The thing is; this month it's a new 40-50 dollar video card. 6 months ago it was a new memory stick. 6 months previous to that it was a new Processor. 6 months before that it was a new memory stick and video card. 6 months before that it was a new MoBo+processor+memory. 6 months before that and so on and so forth.<br />
<br />
the only new changes to the engine were; umm, let's see :<br />
<br />
1. new character pixel representation(s). nice, but un necessary. didn't change gameplay excpet for turning them off.<br />
2. new movement animation to trees and grass. nice; but ddn't change gameplay except for turning them off. <br />
3. new depth and geometry(s) filtering. raiding; people turned them down or off. compelling gameplay it's not.<br />
4. new emotes. whooo. next...<br />
<br />
What I'm saying is; what exactly were these upgrades that SoE decided were necessary that most people who play the game at an upper level were already turned down low or even off?<br />
<br />
Justify my 50$ expenditure in new hardware by offering real improvements to EQ's function(s). Not by implementing eye candy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Lynetta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I actually had faster zone times and a lot less lag last night after installing the new stuff. I think it had been a while since I upgraded my drivers. But, Im a naturally optomistic person and totally still addicted to EQ :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Goradain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">I upgrade my 2 PCs last night.  I noticed that both had alot more graphic lag (mostly in PoK, but I'm now getting some lag in all zones).  Zone times were not effected.  One card is a Geforce 4 and one is a Geforce 3600.  Both had the same issue.  Maybe a driver problem (I updated), but who knows.  Near as I can tell this update not only did not improve gameplay, it slowed it down for me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Huh, that's not what I see when i'm surfing the various boards.  I'm seeing a huge chunk of people who can't play anymore, and then another huge chunk of people who don't WANT to play anymore because their character can't handle something as simple as a rock in a path.  You think this is a vast improvement?<br />
<br />
SOE is assuming that if you can't afford a 40$ video card, you can't afford a subscription for the next 6 months. <br />
<br />
I can afford a subscription just fine, the fact of the matter is that I shouldn't have to throw yet ANOTHER 40 (Or more fucking realisitically, 200, since the 40 dollar card is going to be obsolete next year anyway) to play the same fucking game I've been playing since before Kunark.  See, there's this thing called the real world, and for a lot of people who started playing 4 -5 years ago, the real world has changed.  When I started playing EQ I had just gotten married, didn't have a daughter, and I also had a roommate on top of that.  My bills were light, and I didn't give a shit how much money my gaming habit took, because i had the money to throw around.<br />
<br />
Now I'm a father who's looking at buying a house sometime soon here.  It comes down to whether I want to keep throwing down cash to play a game I already paid for, or whether I want to get this house, and more importantly, get it PAID OFF so that my future is more financially stable.  There's a big difference between the college kid attitude here, who maybe works 20 hours a week and lives with his parents or in a virtually free dorm, and people who's lives have changed in 4 years and are trying to support a family and still get a little gaming time in.  EQ is quickly telling us that it's not the game to play if we want that.  If they think the game is going to last being aimed at ONLY 18-22 year olds, they've got another thing coming.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">and for the record too; my PC athough slightly dated ( P4 2.4ghz with 1024 megs RAM and GeForce2 ) runs okay with the new additons. My wifes PC is kaput with the new changes. My backup PC is kaput as well.<br />
<br />
The new changes to my rig is fine; and it does run well. But i'm only 1 of 400,000 and everyone does not have the available funds and/or knowledge to build or buy another $1000 rig just to play a game. It's not fair to the everyday casual let's go kill some orcs and roleplay and goof around player. <br />
<br />
Even to the conspiracy theorists out there; to limit an established game title to ONE video card company is quite an idea. I wonder if they have more stock in nVidia than I do :D I guess I can expect a nice raise to my stock worth in the upcoming quarter.</div></div><hr />

There is a thread on SoE's tech support pages that's getting near 100 replies many all about this video card or similar Radeon cards. These are new cards, some are even top end cards for home PC's and the only thing i've heard is that some TSR told somebody they knew there were issues and the should just buy a different card.

My comp is not a top of the line or anything, and I noticed a big increase with this jump to DX9 (DX9 itself is a big step over 8), they added some cool stuff here and there (new sky that I actually like, and even the epics shine differently) but I think even when they would had just change the DX core, it would have been a good improvement. I know it sucks to have to pay to buy hardware for an old game, after all these years, I have done it a few times myself, but I dont know, with my old video card it works, maybe buying a Gforce 2 instead of a FX or something like that it's much more cheaper and it works wonders anyways, just an idea.

The thing is; this month it's a new 40-50 dollar video card. 6 months ago it was a new memory stick. 6 months previous to that it was a new Processor. 6 months before that it was a new memory stick and video card. 6 months before that it was a new MoBo+processor+memory. 6 months before that and so on and so forth.<br />
<br />
the only new changes to the engine were; umm, let's see :<br />
<br />
1. new character pixel representation(s). nice, but un necessary. didn't change gameplay excpet for turning them off.<br />
2. new movement animation to trees and grass. nice; but ddn't change gameplay except for turning them off. <br />
3. new depth and geometry(s) filtering. raiding; people turned them down or off. compelling gameplay it's not.<br />
4. new emotes. whooo. next...<br />
<br />
What I'm saying is; what exactly were these upgrades that SoE decided were necessary that most people who play the game at an upper level were already turned down low or even off?<br />
<br />
Justify my 50$ expenditure in new hardware by offering real improvements to EQ's function(s). Not by implementing eye candy.  <br />
<br />
You said it yourself, all the previous updates to the graphics were optional.  This is the first one that was required.  So saying you're being &quot;forced&quot; to upgrade every 6 months is false.<br />
<br />
They HAD to make an upgrade like this sooner or later to remain viable against the other MMORPGs coming out.  The performance of the old engine versus that of the current games coming out was just horrible.  You can't except them to keep the old one forever if they want to stay competitive.  Sure, they might lose a few people to it, but in the long run they'll keep a lot more.  And yes, it requires tweaking more, especially concerning the collision detection, but that's the way it's always been with the first release of anything, EQ or not.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Uukla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">No, They didnt have to make this change to compete with other games coming out.  Thats total BS.  A game competes on content.  Otherwise people who turned off all thier graphics to raid would have changed to DAoC or SWG, or some other game when it came out with thier spiffier graphics.   The point is, they had a game that was running 5/2 year old graphics (original / luclin) and it had a good customer base.<br />
If they think that they can keep customers happy with graphics, they are fooling themselves.  What is keeping customers now is content which is new to each customer (those that are working on elemental access that didnt have it before, or GoD for those who did) and the YEARS that customers have invested in thier accounts.<br />

Yall think you have problems?  Im running a damn celeron 400 with a diamond video card that cant seem to understand it has a TnT2 chipset.  I can log on, but damn if I can do anything more than stare at the ground in the bazaar with my trader mule.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Umm, that is my point :D. I HAD the option(s). But to increase my usability as a contributing member of a guild and for friend's alone..I needed upgrades.<br />
<br />
New PC graphics I could switch back to old world. Few months down the road and if I wanted my dogmor or horsey ( casters need these things I guess, and the majority of EQ as we l know cast spells ) to work I NEEDED to upgrade. So, there's the necessary upgrade. Not to me; but to a LOT of players.<br />
<br />
New Trees and Grass. I'll give a that one. Wasn't needed, not necessary, and can still be turned off.<br />
<br />
Every Expansion dating from Kunark was more graphics and horsepower intensive to your current rig. Even with clipping at a minimum most older rigs lagged. Forget it if you Raid. Every option you had was at 0% or &gt;5% due to wanting to be able to move. So, it's either not raid and fall out of EQ or buy upgrade. <br />
<br />
With the exact setup and hardware of all 3 of my previous PC's I had previous to this patch the capability of running the game Dating from Day 1 to Pre-this patch. Luckily as a pure melee I did't need no stinkin' horsey graphics either.<br />
<br />
Do the other 'x' number of people without GeForce cards have that same capability today ? No.<br />
<br />
It's sink or swim. The final arguement I know is basically 'shut up and buy a new card for $50. or quit EQ' which most people will shout to the hills ... but my whole point is that limiting the game as this day and age by forseeing some ray of sunshine that &quot;OH NOS WoW IS THIS GOOD WE NEED TO UPGRADE OUR OBSOLETE GRAPHICS WITH UNKNOWNS AND EYE CANDY AND ELIMINATE TOTALLY 15% +/- OF OUR PLAYERBASE IN THE FLIP OF THE PATCHER&quot; is just plain; for the lack of a better word;  plain silly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is true.  If you're a gamer, I think most people upgrade *something* at least once a year, if not build a whole new system.  If you've been a hardcore gamer for 5 years on the same computer that's amazing.  My original EQ machine has been in the dumpster for 3 years at least.  My current computer is a year and a half old and last night was just amazing.  We had the biggest raid my guild has *ever* had (for some reason we get 20 more people than usual on Tuesday nights)...80 people, and I had all models on, all particle effects on, and zero lag.  This has never happened before.  <br />
<br />
For every person with a 4-5 year old video card, there was somebody with a Radeon 9800 that was pissed because their new $400 card got them little to no improvment in EQ.  You can't make everybody happy, and if your computer can't play EQ you can't play most other current games either.  Saying you're leaving EQ because your computer can't play it and then buying a new comp so you can play WoW seems a bit silly to me, but whatever makes you happy I guess.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It doesn't seem silly if you don't want to encourage that kind of behavior.<br />
<br />
Lets say for a minute that you want to go back and play Total Annihilation or Doom 2 or Quake or something, but you can't, because your system can't run it anymore...it needs new hardware.  That's right, the game you bought 5 years ago, now requires a 3ghz system with 2 gigs of ram to run.  It didn't when you bought the game, nothing has changed, the game isn't any better of a game than it was 5 years ago, but now you can't run it.  What kind of crap would that be?<br />
<br />
Saying that EQ NEEDED to do this is bullshit.  They didn't need new spell particles, they didn't need a new graphics engine, hell, they didn't even need new fucking models with luclin.  If the game kicks ass, people will fucking play it, but they seem to be catering to the dipshit monkeys who only like shiny things. <br />
<br />
I don't want to encourage other games doing this.  If enough people believe the same, and this ends up hurting EQ bigtime, then no other game will do it.  I'll have my new system in a couple weeks here, and I'll still be patiently awaiting the release of Doom 3 and a beta e-mail from WoW, and I'll NOT be playing a game that thought they could force me to upgrade after 5 years.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">Look, EQ is a really still a ground breaking game. It's been the first to do alot of things, and for good or bad this is another. It's true: No other game has ever really REQUIRED new hardware since release. This could honestly increase EQ's lifespan by alot. Yes, it'll screw people over to start, but if 5 years after release WoW is still interesting to as many people as EQ is currently, they'll revamp stuff too. They'll increase graphics, and if enough fundamental engine changes are required, they may do a similar shift. <br />
<br />
Lets say for a minute that you want to go back and play Total Annihilation or Doom 2 or Quake or something, but you can't, because your system can't run it anymore<br />

  Not really relevent at all, but just taking this little blurb, I spent ~ 10 hours (probably more) last week trying to play old DOS games from the early '90s. I had to give up on some of them, because Windows XP doesn't run them. It sucks! I guess I could install DOS on one of my drives and occasionally boot into it, if I could get all the drivers together... Stupid DOS games.</div></div><hr />

But would you want to?  That's the difference in my mind.  EQ is not the same game that came out 5 years ago, and that's why people are still playing it.</div></div><hr />

That was EXACTLY why they needed to update the engine.  The engine performed like shit compared to the kinds of graphics it was producing.  If you tried playing those new games of yours on graphics engines produced 5 years ago, your framerate would be about 2fps.<br />
<br />
I'd also like a list of those other games of yours, to compare their graphics to the CPU/GPU power they take to produce versus EQ pre and post patch.</div></div><hr />

Maybe I don't understand this, or maybe we're just different kinds of people.<br />
<br />
Yes, I actually did recently run thru Doom 2 just because I was bored with my gaming options.  I regularly load up Q2 and DM for a couple days when I feel like blasting someone's ass.  TA is still one of the best RTS games ever in my opinion.  Warcraft 3 fucking rules and all, but there's still nothing like a coordinated Tank/Bombing run/Nuclear Strike.  When I stop playing a game I don't just chuck the discs in the trash, it just falls out of the regular rotation of games I play.  How often it comes back in depends on how often I enjoyed said game.  <br />
<br />
I could probably tolerate playing EQ a couple times a year, just for something to do, at least until I remember how there's nothing for me to do anyway.<br />
<br />
If they stopped developing EQ, you wouldn't ever need new hardware either. <br />
<br />
This would be an acceptable reason if I was able to play my version and you guys could go ahead with this &quot;Upgrade.&quot;  Since it's not, people like me get fucked, and you don't see a problem.  Well of course not.</div></div><hr />

Make the engine platform flexible enough to support many different driver sets.  They went the lazy route (setting a minimum bar) and now they have made some of their customer base unhappy.<br />

I also had this issue with the SoL expansion; why not create a load option for &quot;clunky old original eq&quot; and &quot;for spiffy new eq&quot;?

For SoL you can still load &quot;clunky old EQ&quot; by not installing the new textures, etc, and chosing the old models, so I don't get what you're problem is there.

No, you can't. <br />
<br />
Every expansion to date, whether you install it or not, has slowed down EQ.  Luclin without luclin models is slower than Velious was.

Yes, you can.  It's an option when you install SoL whether or not to get the new textures.  And you can always chose which models to use.  I really like how you show that my logic fails &quot;because SOE sucks!&quot;, when your statements are based solely on how you &quot;feel&quot; the game plays when a new expansion comes out.  If you think EQ sucks so bad, why not play another game?  Oh wait, your current system probably can't play any of those, either.</div></div><hr />

     I've had DX9 for a long time now, I also have several other games that use DX9 and have never had a problem with any of them with my current drivers. The fact of the matter is that SoE knew there were problems with this videocard well in advance of this patch being implemented and they gave no warning and still refuse to admit that there's a problem either with there engine or with the ATI drivers themselves, they simply tell you to download a driver that does nothing to fix the problem. It's obvious that they don't take time to properly test there product before dumping it on us, there are several other problems that many people are having with this patch, the cornering problem, the warping beneath the world, I've heard some people can't run up an incline with a mount, as well as some other odd pathing glitches.

Apparantly you're not understanding me here.  I never chose to install any new textures with SoL.  Not when it came out, and not the last time I reinstalled the game.  It changes NOTHING.  EQ IS SLOWER EVERY EXPANSION AND YOU DON'T HAVE A CHOICE IN THE MATTER.  There are options to minimize the slowdown, but that's like saying you were wearing a fur coat when you got into a car accident so you're better protected.<br />
<br />
And if you can argue that SoE doesn't have the shittiest programming, and more importantly, testing division in the world today, I'd like to fucking hear it.  There is simply no excuse for 95% of the bullshit they push off the test server, and never has been.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For information I run a 3Ghz P4, 9800 Pro, 1Gig RAM and I can run the game just fine, but that doesn't change the fact that this change was bullshit and should never have been done.  A new sky with stars does not help SoE compete against other games, content does and your graphics engine has nothing to do with that.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u73"><b>Gabriel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p73">Wow a lot of hostility here.  Yes my eyes are bleeding from reading the whole rantfest.....  All in All, last night after a fresh hard drive/XP/Drivers/EQ (my choice btw) I logged on and all was great.  xp2600/9800pro/1gig/etc etc.  I really do like the changes, I get zero lag right up until Im on a mob and 10 different particle effects go off at once.  I can fix that under my options though.<br />
Wifes computer asked her to upgrade her video drivers, which in turn fucked up her system, washed out colors even on the desktop, so we reverted back and hell it looks great there as well.<br />
I think the new engine will allow greater changes in the future, not just in &quot;eye candy&quot; but in lag/playability.  I don't pay for a game that is 5 years old, I pay for a game that is updated monthly/(insert timeframe here) that is still fun to play.  With changing technology, how could SOE say five years ago, &quot;Hey you will be required to upgrade to things that havent been invented yet, we know it so suck it up!&quot;  Seems to me this is like the whole Windows ME thing with microsoft.  They said they won't support it after this date, people raised hell and they reinstated the support but set a new drop dead date for nonsupport.  Point is, the technology went beyond ME and moved into bigger and better things and thus the software moved on.  Lets face it.  This is a first with any game.  Sony has put out a product that has lasted 5 years and continues to be the top rated game on the market.  We are in uncharted waters here.  Do you expect them to stay stagnant with 5 year old technology or move along with the tide?  If nothing had changed in 5 years would you still play this game?  Hell I wouldn't.  <br />
When something else comes along, hell maybe even WoW, that stands the test of time, do you think they wont make changes like this as well?  Everyone trying to make a game like this is taking notes and will try to do things a little different or a lot different.  But after 5 years of playing, it would be naive to think you would still be able to play said game with the hardware you started with.  Stand alone games cannot even be compared to EQ as they are not supported beyond a certain timeframe, and if they are, they are usually supported by the fanbase (maps etc).  So that falls a bit short.  I understand what people are trying to say here, but hell, you have played 5 years or 4 or 3 or whatever, if this does it for you, then move on, WoW is around the corner, just don't expect to play it on a 5 year old system ;-)<br />
EQ is all about money for SOE, they don't have anything else to prove to anyone.  And again it would be naive to think they make these decisions on a whim.  They do their homework, make decisions based on the bottom line and press.  This might initially fudge the bottom line a bit in the short term from you people quitting in mass, but lets face it, they will get more EQ addicts to replace you (and me when I finally leave) because they have a game that looks pretty, can be played for years, provides social interaction for those stuck in their basements, and hell can be downright fun.<br />
Ok enough of the blabbering, the prior reading if affecting my perceptions atm.  Good Luck all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm sorry if it screwed up your crappy antique computer, but your shitty old computer was standing in the way of progress.  If you don't want to upgrade then you can quit.  That's what Sony is telling you.  Rant all you want, but that's the facts.  They knew how many people it was going to effect (or at least had a good idea).  They never would have gone to the time and effort of making these changes if they didn't think it would make the game better for the vast majority of players, and it has (or will in some cases).  They knew some of you would cancel your accounts.  They went ahead with the changes anyway, and I for one am glad they did.  I'll be more glad when they fix the collision detection problems, but I'm sure they will get that worked out eventually.  <br />

I downloaded the newest driver from ATI's website and from what I noticed is. Zero LAG in POK and surprisingly the bazaar.  The bazaar had over 500 people in it and still I didn't notice any lag with all models on.   Not bad for a 172 dollar video card.</div></div><hr />

It's an option when you install SoL whether or not to get the new textures. And you can always chose which models to use.<br />
When SoL was released it was optional to install the updated textures and it has been optional to run new or old models, however when SoL was released EQ also had a graphics engine upgrade that was not optional. (you can't turn off new wolves or new skeletons for example, there isnt an old model option for frogloks and there wasnt an old model option for Vah Shir when Luclin was released.  That came later.)<br />
<br />
It wasnt the requirement to run new models vs old models or use the new textures that caused problems, it was the change in graphics engine.  When SoL was released DirectX8 (or was it 8.1?) became required, several popular cards became unsupported (Voodoo 1 &amp; 2 cards?) and Windows 95 became nolonger supported (They had to go so far as to offer refunds of purchase price and subscription to win95 users).<br />
<br />
The driver issue is a big pain in the arse, and also the reason why I will never buy an ATI video card - driver issues.  I have a friend running EQ on a AMD Duron 700 w/512mb ram and a Geforce2 MX and it runs like a dog, but it ran like a dog before the patch and more importantly it still runs despite the card being 3+ years old.  His Geforce2 MX uses the same driver as the FX5600 in my GF's PC - no problems there.</div></div><hr />

I don't beleive I'm ignoring the real issue at all.  I think I just feel the real issue is different then you do and so you tell me my opinion doesn't count because of it.  In my opinion the real issue is the &quot;upgrade&quot; made the game run better for a few and not at all for others.  I think for EQ to compete they need to stop worring about how flashy it looks and start worrying about actual game mechanics and content.  <br />

Second, how does the world look from your high horse?  You sound pretty pompous there.  You wanna step down from your soap box now and take a look at the rest of the world?  Not everyone has even $40 bucks to just toss down on a new computer part.  The 13 bucks a month they have been laying down for the last few years is about all they can manage and now SoE is telling all of those people to go fuck themselves and the years they have spent supporting this game don't mean shit.

EQ is not a right and it's not a necessity.  If you don't have the computer to play it on, then you can either not play it or get a better computer.  I'm not gonna shed any tears for you either way.

That is the card that's in my bot computer.  It did fine on an 80 person raid last night.  It costs $29.  Less than one EQ expansion.  Less than a tank of gas where I live.  Hell cancel your account for 2 months and you can pretty much buy it with the savings.  <br />

  Not by pulling the plug on the servers, not by stop developing new expansions.  It is their incompetance as a company,  I never seen so much incompetance in a software company besides M$ that feels the need that they can release half assed code and let the paying customers deal with until they get around to fix it.  They did not need to rush this graphic engine, a new graphic engine needs to be tested till it hurts.

I did read the thread, well most of it, its gets boring reading rants from the same people everytime something new happens,  and most of the people bitchin about how they don't want to upgrade for EQ and they can't wait for WoW or Vanguard and its idiotic to think that either of those games won't use the latest technology.  I mean I would want to play a game that uses the latest technology, not some game that uses technology from 3 years ago just so a few thousand people who are too cheap to spend $20 on a dx9.0 compatiable card can play the game and people bitching that they can't play on a 2 year old laptop, shows how intelligent they are and the playerbase as a whole is better off without those types of idiots. <br />
<br />
And its not like SoE all of a sudden sprung this on the player base, they have been saying that dx9 cards would be required for months. The game has continued to change and grow, over the 5 years its been out, which is why they have 400k people playing it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They seriously did a lot of testing on this stuff. It has been on Test for like 3 weeks now and it has come a long way.  Really every problem I knew about (except for getting stuck on the rocks) was fixed when it went live.  Of course a couple thousand people on the test server aren't gonna find every bug, so some of them show up after the live patch.  Do you play some other game that never patches bugs?  <br />
<br />
Just for an info update a Dev opened up a channel on test last night for people to join and feedback on about the DX9 stuff.  Apparently the /rewind command was disabled because people were using it to exploit dain and other banishing mobs.  Instead we had &quot;autorewind&quot; on test last night, which was annoying as hell (basically when you run into something you would get stuck on it automatically bounces you back a couple feet).  We were fighting next to a stalagmite in water that was bouncing me around all the time but it's better than getting stuck.  According to the dev that's just a quick fix until they can get the collision detection stuff fixed.  He said that the issue with gnomes and small characters climbing stairs is fixed and they were working on the collision detection problems and seemed confident that they could fix them.  <br />
<br />
I ran into some rocks in PoT last night and it didn't really seem that bad to me.  I could run over the plane of earth and plane of water zone rocks no problem, so I'm not sure where people are having issues.  I guess probably there were some times where you would have bounced to the sides but just stopped now, but any rock that I should have been able to get over I could still run over.  Of course I'm a barb so I have never been able to get over anything steep.  Should have tried to climb a spire with my cleric I guess.  <br />
<br />
The dev also said that the problems with intel cards was fixed and they didn't know they didn't work until yesterday.  Of course non-dx9 compatible cards are never going to work.  He suggested that if you were using an allegedly compatible card but still having problems to /feedback with detailed system specs and if they could replicate your system they could fix it.<br />
<br />
Finally, my cleric's machine (1GHz Athlon with a 64Mb GeForce2) was running much better last night.  He had been taking 3-4 minutes to zone since the dx9 stuff came out but last night he was zoning in probably less than 15 seconds.<br />
<br />
That's about all I can remember from the dev chat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u102"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p102">I used to play a caster with all Luclin models off, my system just ran better.  Then they required you to have Luclin models on to use your horse.  That kind of pissed me off.<br />
<br />
The only thing I have noticed with this change is that the graphics are marginally better, really marginally.  In return we have mobs warping more, targetting issues, and lag on slower systems.  It's not a good trade-off.  We have five systems in our house that we play EQ on, my whole family plays.  One of those systems is so laggy now that it is basically unplayable, which kinds of sucks.  What I think they don't think about is for a lot of people it's not one new $50 video card, it's multiple systems that need upgrades each time they make a change that requires better hardware.<br />
<br />
I really am not opposed to the move to DX9 that strongly, but that's probably because four of the five systems are fine...  But if 2-3 of them had broken I'd be more than a little pissed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u103"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p103">For SoL you can still load &quot;clunky old EQ&quot; by not installing the new textures, etc, and chosing the old models, so I don't get what you're problem is there. <br />
<br />
And no, supporting 2 game engines is NOT easy. Every wonder why they don't make games where PCs and Macs can play on the same servers? It would be a nightmare. <br />
<br />
Ok I'm going to be harsh here:<br />
<br />
1. My issue with Luclin was 2 YEARS ago.  The actual issue with SoL had nothing to do with models but with a new technology (for that time) called Umbral that was integrated (poorly) into the video engine.  My point, if you bothered to read it, was at that point they also could have created two load options for the client (basically a &quot;basket&quot; approach to customer service as opposed to a &quot;minimum bar&quot;).<br />
<br />
2. As a guy with a very long development background I can tell you that yes indeed two engines is not easy.  However, SoE toughts itself as &quot;the first and largest MMORG&quot;.  My point, again you need to read, is that this issue (volume and technical straification of consumer base) is something SoE has as part of their core business solution.  <br />
<br />
Because it is NOT easy this requires some highly creative thinking to design and implement a system that is not dependant on a &quot;minimum bar&quot; approach.  And yes it is possible.<br />
<br />
You Mac/PC is not a question of drivers/engine (which are APPLICATION/OS level code issues) but are ARCHITECTURAL/PLATFORM issues.  You are making an analogy that isn't even close to applicable.  If you want I can get into the detailed messaging level differences between Mac and PC based OS's.<br />
<br />
/shrug I'm sure in 1 month folks will either quit EQ or upgrade their equipment.</div></div><hr />

One of those systems is so laggy now that it is basically unplayable, which kinds of sucks.  <br />
<br />
I'd give it a shot after the next patch again.  My bot computer has been extremely laggy since the DX9 engine came out, but was hugely improved with last night's patch on test.  Literally went from taking 3 minutes to zone to taking 15 seconds.<br />

If you're still having issues after the next patch be sure to /feedback with your exact system specs and what your problem is.</div></div><hr />

The game did affect me I had to replace my card. I did it and it works fine. I do not have a problem with this because Sony has been friggin pounding it into our heads for a minimum of 2 months that this was going to happen.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u116"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p116">My brother and I grew up working on various cattle ranches, among which was the ranch owned by our great uncle.<br />
One of the jobs on the ranch was to irrigate hay fields, most of which were flood irrigated. To get water to flood evenly and slowly out of ditches across a big field involves a good deal of mucking around with shovels and walking back and forth in 90 degree heat.<br />
One day as they were changing irrigation dams my brother said to our great uncle, &quot;You know, we spend 90 percent of our time out here trying to get water onto the last 10 percent of the ground. If we just gave up on those high spots we'd save a lot of time.&quot;<br />
My great uncle stopped digging in the ditch and leaned on his shovel for a minute, staring at my brother. Then he smiled--just barely--and he said, &quot;Ten percent is my profit margin.&quot;<br />
<br />
The unsupport cards/required upgrades situation is is not a technology issue. It's a business calculation. <br />
Sony has estimated how many customers it will lose by requiring system upgrades and how many they will lose by not making this or that &quot;improvement.&quot; <br />
I think their decision curve is influenced by a number of special circumstances surrounding EQ, including the fact that this game is highly addictive.<br />
I don't know if their cost/benefit analysis was correct. And neither do they--they won't know until the numbers are in.<br />
Anyway, this is not about microprocessors; it's about microeconomics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u117"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p117">And to top it off, if you make people upgrade their video cards now to keep playing EQ, then they will be ready for EQ2 when it comes out.  Thus people who may not have upgraded thier systems to play a new game, might do it to keep playing EQ now, and then when EQ2 comes out they are more likely to buy it!<br />

Between you, me, and the trees, I've heard a VERY VERY  UNSUBSTANTIATED rumor that EQ2 might end up being more of an &quot;expansion&quot; than a new game anyway, in the hopes of not killing the golden goose (EQ) for short term profit (EQ2 launch).  Having a mmorpg keep &quot;up with the times&quot; in terms of hardware/software support is a Good Thing, shows long term commitment to the player base, and suggests Better Things To Come.  It's also, as several people have very vocally pointed out, a severe Pain In The As... Posterior for some.  For those, all I can say is try not to take it personally, I'm pretty sure it wasn't meant as a slap or insult, but like the folks said above, it's a business decision... and one that can be reasonably interpreted as solidly &quot;good intent&quot; for the player base as a whole.<br />
<br />

p.s. I had to upgrade a few systems too, waterfalled some GEF3's to backup pcs (both wife's and my &quot;backup&quot; pcs heh) and dropped in a few new ATI9800 pro's.  Very happy w/ the results, the main systems needed the bump up for UT2k4 anyway. :)</div></div><hr />

The thing is; this month it's a new 40-50 dollar video card. 6 months ago it was a new memory stick. 6 months previous to that it was a new Processor. 6 months before that it was a new memory stick and video card. 6 months before that it was a new MoBo+processor+memory. 6 months before that and so on and so forth.<br />
<br />
the only new changes to the engine were; umm, let's see :<br />
<br />
1. new character pixel representation(s). nice, but un necessary. didn't change gameplay excpet for turning them off.<br />
2. new movement animation to trees and grass. nice; but ddn't change gameplay except for turning them off. <br />
3. new depth and geometry(s) filtering. raiding; people turned them down or off. compelling gameplay it's not.<br />
4. new emotes. whooo. next...<br />
<br />
What I'm saying is; what exactly were these upgrades that SoE decided were necessary that most people who play the game at an upper level were already turned down low or even off?<br />
<br />
Justify my 50$ expenditure in new hardware by offering real improvements to EQ's function(s). Not by implementing eye candy.  <br />
<br />
I tend to disagree, in order to allow the game to keep getting new people as the old ones quit, it needs to stay looking fresh.<br />
<br />
here is my problem with that, first of all it is MAJORLY undertested, Second the motherfuckers said that if you card can run DX 9, it will run EQ with no more slow down than before, it might even improve your preformance, this is a bullshit lie because the bullshit test server didnt report enough bugs, Third problem is they said you may keep all the old stuff, you dont have to get the new skys, textures, spell effects ETC, but again, bullshit lie, no off button, no .ini file editable line to keep it like it was, it is not backwards compatable AT ALL.<br />
<br />
the way to fix this is to allow players to keep playing on old graphics if they choose to, allow us with better PCs the option to play with more sparklys and crisper textures etc, but of course this will never happen because they are eather to stupid or to lazy to support 2 differnt groups of customers at once, this is shown by their total lack of phone service(in the past) or lack of GMs in game(current), their total lack of raiding(or casual) content in one expantion, and to much in another.<br />
<br />
its everquest, get used to people that need to be smacked in the face by their players in order to figure something out(like our standdown did)<br />
<br />
anyways mine runs the puffy clouds so im not effected by this, but i do feel bad for ya.</div></div><hr />

LOL ok Partha whatever man.  Why are you getting all defensive about me calling the coders of EQ a bunch of cracker jack hacks, they are because that is what type of code they release.  They continously release half assed code to live servers and that is ok with you I don't see how it could.  We pay for this shit so we should DEMAND that this shit be done right.  I am not talking about simple bugs these things happen I am talking about the major bugs that are released like that was in this patch. <br />
<br />
<br />
If they can patch the patch a day later why didnt that wait a day to release the first patch if that was all the time that was needed to fix it. They did not have to rush the graphic engine it could of waited a couple of more months so that the proper development and testing needed for this major revamp to the game.   We are talking about the engine that runs the game not a fucking boat or the DPS of the Mage pets here.  It shouldn't have been rushed and released that is all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just an idea here; but how many people were brought into EQ on the sole reason alone of just seeing the box at the store as compared to meeting friends who do play the game and talked to others about how much fun it was and they should try it? Or even just by browsing across thee Internet and running across player's websites and MB's like this here and coming to their own conclusions?<br />
<br />
Usually ( I know this doesn't apply to EQ but eh... ) the best marketing is word of mouth and; well; I tend to believe that keeping your well-established ( 5 years on a videogame is huge ) players happy and feeling like they contribute in all ways from customer service to actually listening to the people who see all facets of gameplay from all angles and can unbiasly contribute to it's development is something i'd strive for. I'd let my players sell the game for me. Happy people can do more towards expanding my market than any amount of advertising can; especially in a gmaing market where the 'new and fresh feeling' often leaves in the blink of an eye.<br />
<br />
But, this is EQ and none of that applies <br />

For one, if you have a Radeon card, you only use one driver set, just like NVidia. Secondly, what makes them a better card, when they designed the chipset, they built it around DirectX, which the GEForce FX line did not. If you look at all the benchmarks and tests out there, www.hardocp.com for one, you will see that even the old  Radeon 9700 Pro and 9500 Pro cards smoke most of the newer FX cards out there just based on the archecture of the chipset.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u138"><b>Kizef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p138">My wife's 4yr old laptop would just barely run eq with Dx8.  <br />
<br />
She went out and found some newer drivers ( from a totally differnent Laptop manufacturer)  and install dx9.0. Now her 700 p3 with 8 meg Ati rage Video card run great.<br />
<br />
We were worried about looseing a laptop, but now it runs almost as good as my 1gig p3 with 32 meg geforce2.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So before everyone freaks out, try looking around for some drivers. Her laptop maker went out of business so she had to go somewhere else to find drivers that would work with dx9. <br />
<br />
<br />
Here is a good link to find drivers for your old &quot;un-supported&quot; cards;<br />
