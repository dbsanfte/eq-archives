<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Viladdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello,<br />
<br />
Can anyone please suggest some good farming spots for a 61 warrior (solo, got ToD, Fungi and maxed Bind Wounds) ? I've heard the boats in Dulak are not bad, never been there tho. Mostly looking for raw cash / gems but if some item can drop that can be selled without too much pain, I'm interested aswell :)<br />
<br />
Also, what about soloing for exp ? I know a warrior cannot do anything great just alone, but still wondering if it is possible.<br />
<br />
And, a last question, do you think I could farm the Kael bank area ? I need dragon faction, but Kael is pretty desert nowadays...<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Compo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I heard you said SOLO /shiver<br />
<br />
Try the 2 Archers in the evil side of Echo Cavern (via hidden wall in SH). Turn right after you zoned and open the rock wall. Look to your left, you should see a building that looks like a mini Castle. <br />
<br />
There are 2 anchers on the top. Invis if you can or just run up. The 2 mobs at the front of the castle, you can solo them for exp.<br />
<br />
About the Archers, get well prepared before engage the 1st time to get a feel. They summon, you dont want to risk.<br />
<br />
Each archer drops 2 bows and some arrow. Each Bow can be sold to vendor for up to 18ish pp. They are on LONG timer like 25mins.<br />
<br />
Good Luck. That was a hot spot for warriors to solo pre-PoP!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aurthur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I just thought I'd chime in and mention that you don't want to disarm the archers...when you take away their bow, their damage increases X2.<br />
<br />
Nurga is soloable and XP not too far from the zoneline, and the mobs drop decent cash loot (5-10 plat per).  <br />
<br />
Shrooms in FG are solo-fodder...not sure if they go LBlue at 61, it's been a while.<br />
<br />
If you don't care about faction, Coldain in EW drop plat &amp; heads that sell for 50-100 to the faction inclined.<br />
<br />
You could also probably solo a good way into Seb, try for a rare drop off the common mobs.  <br />
<br />
All in all, you're of course better off getting into even a poor adventure/xp group than going solo'ing...for both plat and XP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Just play the cash-rich LDON adventures.<br />
<br />
You will get half an AA point.<br />
<br />
You will get between 200-300 platinum.<br />
<br />
You will get 51 adventure points.<br />
<br />
You can do it all in 50 minutes with a strong pickup group.<br />
<br />
Why not get everything at once? Screw the soloing. Get yourself some sweet nodrop gear, platinum at 200-300 per hour and augs and other crap.<br />
<br />
Not to mention some sellable droppables.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gruda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I kill coldain wolfmasters for giggles while I am hanging out the LFG flag, or waiting for my RL friends to log on.  They drop a few plat, the velium weapons velium sell for a few plat, and on The Tribunal, the heads sell in the bazaar for 150 plat.  If I know I will have just a couple hours to play, I completely empty my bags of everything but one stack of food and one stack of drink, and go do the grimling orefinder caves in Tenebrous Mountains.  They drop  marks that vendor sell pretty well, they drop some gems, including windstones (sells fairly well in the bazaar to tradeskillers), and they drop acrylia ore (sells for about 70-80 plat a brick in the bazaar).  You might also catch the grimling runner and get the pouch for making the Rallic pack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Viladdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ok, thanks for the tips. In fact, though I perfectly know that soloing is really limited for a warrior, I do sometimes have too few time to group (casual player here). For instance, when I only have something like 2 hours for playing EQ, what can I do but soloing ? Creating or finding a group takes time, and 2 hours is not enough for that, even for a LDoN adventure (btw I love LDoN, what Jakle said is 100% true). So, instead of just sitting on my arse in the baz for 2 hours, I'd better go somewhere and whack some mobs, at least I'll get a bit of cash.<br />
<br />
That's why I was asking about Kael, since I need dragon faction, do you think that I could solo there ? If it was possible, I would probably use those little periods of time to build some Skyshrine faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">heres a suggestion, try the kael guard WL side, you can kill them most are LB or blue, as for farming go to TS and go to the shade island, people will pay 50 for each swirling shadow and you get about 2-3 each kill, id get some resists tho first</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The best things you can do to get your group together and the adventure done in 2 hours...(I am in the same boat you are)<br />
<br />
/who all 65 lfg.<br />
<br />
/who all 65 cleric lfg.<br />
<br />
/who all 65 Ench lfg.<br />
<br />
/who all 65 bard lfg.<br />
<br />
/who all 65 DPS lfg.<br />
<br />
<br />
At least see if you can get a Cleric and Ench/Bard in the first 20 minutes.<br />
<br />
If you can't, then go ahead and solo. Once you get the CC and the healer, you are basically done and can get anyone.<br />
<br />
ALWAYS do the slaughter mission if you are pressed for time.<br />
<br />
Sticking to Dungeons like Takhiz will get you people the fastest. They are the easiest to pull by a mile and have lots of summoned junk that mages can tear to pieces. (or charm golems $$)<br />
<br />
Try that and see if you can get a group going in 30 mins or less.<br />
<br />
Just send out multiple tells and as soon as they start sticking tell people that the group is getting full....<br />
<br />
It works pretty well. Just don't wipe. Wiping is the #1 way to have your wife hate you when you tell her you will be on for an hour and a half.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">farm tradeskill components - poaches in JP drop furs, quite often can get high quality ones.<br />
<br />
wyverns in CS - about 1 in 4 drop 40-50pp cash gems, plus every other wyvern or so drops artic wyvern hide which ive sold for about 25pp each to tradeskillers.<br />
<br />
alternatively farm silks &amp; acrylia in crystal caverns.<br />
<br />
not sure how much exp that will get you though.<br />
<br />
your best bet really is to do LDON adventures.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ramirezz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">not sure on exp places but if Im strap for cash I farm Crystal Caverns kill all the  Ry'gorr Miner  and save all the velium you can to sell in the bazaar prices may vary from server to server.    They drop some chump change, but hey its cash.   Go all the way down and kill all the spiders in there and collect there crystalline silks used for trade skills you can sell in the bazaar.    Some drop some snare trigger silks  I keep those for fun.     And kill the  geonids for there gems near the  tunnel to EW.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Yiktin Voxbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I have always favoured Velketors, underused, silks that sell in bazaar, quest armour gems (ok not the goldmine they used to be)<br />
and velium. With a ToD U will eat them, especially if Packing some blistering flesh potions.<br />
<br />
I did 57-61 here largely solo (hey I'm an aussie, makes LFG a chore, just easier to solo), infact I managed to go 1-15 in steamfont......26-28 firescale croc.... Late 40's early 50's entry mobs in SolB (xp modifier helped here)....then 57-61 in VL.<br />
<br />
Since then has been in my interests to get up @ 4-6AM and do some levelling with guild, tho I still hit VL (Light blue floor mobs @ 65). TD may even be doable now, might have to go check that out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>dreadx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">You can go to rath mtns and kill hill giants for some decent plat if its not to crowded.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not all of us were fucking insane for Crystallized Acid Bracers that we could build up 700k+ there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>azon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">For nostalgia purposes I went to hk, instead of farming crystal caverns for velium, and I made 2k pretty quickly. It was pretty empty, so results may vary. I just killed all the main floor guards, then basement, then I moved up the floors, sellin there swords as soon as I ran out of space.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gharghael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I used to frequent Rathe Mountains to farm Hill Giants. Depending on how much plat they decide to drop that day, and how many druids and necros are in the zone, I actually made a fair amount of cash there. But I'd do a /who when I zoned in, and just turn around if there were more than 10 people in the zone. When it's crowded it sucks balls.<br />
<br />
I like Tenebrous Mountains a lot more. For the most part it's almost always empty except on weekends, mostly because it's kinda out of the way I think. The focus here is the pair of caves along the southern wall of the zone, east of the zone-in from Grimling Forest. These two caves are full of static spawns for grimling orefinders, grimling geomancers, and the occasional grimling foreman. Also, grimling laborers will path in, through, and back out of the caves intermittently. The orefinders are green and completely trivial (I think they're level 30ish). Your HP will barely wiggle. They have about 1khp. The geomancers have around 700hp and will try to cast spells that won't stick. The foreman are slightly higher level and have about twice as much hp as the orefinders. They might bring your hp below 97% if they get some lucky hits in. The laborers are about as weak as the geomancers, but are melee only.<br />
Every single on of these mobs will drop one or more Etched Acrylia Runes with varying names. As far as I know, these are good for nother but selling to a vendor. You can get anywhere from 9gp to 10+pp for each rune. Obviously the cheaper ones are more common. Each of these mobs also have the chance to drop useless weapons that sell for a few plat each. If you spend an hour farming these caves, you'll probably rake in between 200-400pp just from runes and weapons.<br />
The real money here though is from the gems and acrylia. There are small pieces, small bricks, large bricks, and blocks. These sell to players in the bazaar, and depending on the current supply you can get anywhere from 40pp to 100pp for each piece (on Fennin Ro that is). Windstones also drop pretty often, and sell for at least 100pp each to players. A lot of other random luclin gems drop here, most of them selling to vendors for 10-20pp. Some of the more rare gems like Luclinite and Umbracite sell for 80-100pp to vendors.<br />
At the rate that I clear out one of these caves, the first ones start to repop a couple minutes after the last I kill. Your results may vary depending on your DPS. I'm guessing the respawn is about 10minutes. If both caves are uncamped, you can clear one out, clear the other, and come back and the first will be fully popped again.<br />
They also drop vials of blood which are pretty worthless, and mining picks and pieces of pyrrohite (sp?) that are good for faction turn-ins in Katta Castellum. There are some nice quests in Katta.<br />
One of which is the Rallic Pack quest. For the uninitiated, the Rallic Pack is a 10 slot bag, capable of holding giant items, with 85% weight reduction. Basically, you turn in a grimling runner's pouch to a guy named Rallic in Katta to receive a Rallic Pack Pattern. He's on Concillium Universus faction I think, one of Katta's many factions. I believe the pyrrohite sample turn-in quest gives CU faction. Factioning for Katta sucks though. I always just keep an Illusion:Human (any good race works) Potion in the shared bank just for the purpose of doing the Rallic turn-in. I'm a troll. If you're a good race and haven't screwed up your faction, you shouldn't have to worry about it. You combine Rallic's pattern, a perfect owlbear pelt, a shade silk cord, and a shade silk thread in a sewing kit to receive the Rallic Pack. The grimling runner pouch that you turn in to Rallic for the pattern drops off of a grimling runner in Tenebrous Mountains. He spawns just inside the cave to the Grimling Forest zoneline 90 minutes from the time he was last killed. He's about as wimpy as a grimling foreman. From there he'll path along the south edge of the zone going just inside the two orefinder caves and back. The pelts can be obtained from owlbears in Grimling Forest or wherever, but I just buy them in the bazaar for 40pp. The shade silk cords and threads are made from shadeling silks which I just buy in the bazaar for 2pp or farm from xakthra (sp?) silk worms whenever I go through Shadeweaver's Thicket. Trivial on the cords and threads are around 20 or so, and there is no skill-check on the final combine for the pack. These are LORE. I usually sell them for 700-800pp a piece. All of my alts have one, and there's always one in both of my shared banks ready to sell. My sewing kit is always full of a handful of pelts, silks, cords, and threads, and I usually have a spare pattern or pouch on hand.<br />

Oops. I didn't mean to write such a lengthy discourse. And I certainly didn't mean to give away all my sekritz! Oh well. This is what I do when I only have a couple hours to play. It works for me.</div></div><hr />
