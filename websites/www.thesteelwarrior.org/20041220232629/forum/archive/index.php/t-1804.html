<br />
Attack should be displyed as it was, way long ago, in a galaxy far, far way known as beta.<br />
<br />
Attack and Ac should be toggable stats that are displayed by default as the one (less confusing and useful) number and then as the more complex 2 number representations. To hit and damage for Attack and avoidance / mitigation for AC.<br />
<br />
I would have agrued against the dicision when it was made.<br />
<br />
Just have no clue why it took me this long to start a thread on it :p.</div></div><hr />

But having the chance of toggling ingame those numbers would be nice :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
All I remember is when it would say your AC as ####/1000.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">07-08-2003, 02:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Back in bate (which I was not in) and the reason that ATK and AC were both /1000 was they were broken down into their component parts. The 1000s are the place holders for the changeable valuse that were smooshed together.<br />
<br />
To hit (whch from what we can tell is level + offense + weapon skill) and to damage (which has at least some of the same factors as to hit + str). The reason your ATK goes up when you add str is that you to damage rating is going up.<br />
<br />
We now have secondary confirmation of AC being 2 different numbers though CA/CS. CA/CS are how hard you are to hit (which I beleive is the AC raised by Agi buffs) and mitigation---how much your armor helps take the damage. <br />
<br />
Would be nice if CA/CS were displayed in AC too.<br />
<br />
To hit is compaired against CA, to damage against mitigation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flair</div><div class="date">07-08-2003, 04:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Parsing tells you to a certain extent &quot;what&quot; is happening (the 10,000 foot picture if you will.)<br />
<br />
It does not tell you &quot;how&quot; or &quot;why&quot;.  <br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure they moved this stuff behind the curtains for a reason Kailyn.  In essence I think it to deliberately obscure the &quot;how&quot; part of the question (the questions being: How exactly does melee work, How exactly does taunt work, How exactly does agro work, etc at a mechanical level).   <br />
<br />
Still have the same opinion I did 2+ years ago: I do not think they want us to know &quot;how&quot; because it would open them up to accountability (because they do not have the resources to keep the &quot;How&quot; accurate and timely to the level of player expectations).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Luthair</div><div class="date">07-11-2003, 12:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was hoping that we'd get the option to split it up with the NewUI.<br />
<br />
I wasn't in beta, but I remember reading from someone at VI that one of the reasons for merging the values was that two for def/off confused the hell out of people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">07-11-2003, 01:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the option of allowing people to see the two different levels, maybe even after a certain level, would be nice.  You'd kinda know how well you can avoid and mitigate after wearing the freaking armor for a long time.<br />
<br />
Of course if it confuses you, you could just keep it as the one single number...I'd assume the one single number is just mitigation and avoidance added together.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lirelle</div><div class="date">07-11-2003, 08:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am not familiar with the displayed numbers in which everyone is speaking as I just joined onto the game about 2 months prior to PoP, but one point that was brought up did peak my interest.<br />
<br />
Kailyn stated:<br />
<br />
&quot;To hit (whch from what we can tell is level + offense + weapon skill)&quot;<br />
<br />
From my short time playing, it seems to me that Dexterity has some factor in the amount of times that you hit.  I seem to notice that my halfling warrior (base 90 dex) seems to hit quite a bit more than the drow warrior I had (base 75 dex) while wearing the exact same equipment and having offensive + weapon skills maxed.  <br />
<br />
This is mearly a sense that I get however, as I have just gotten into the whole &quot;parsing&quot; thing lately and am not fully up to speed on what the info means.  Also, along with seeming to hit quite a bit more with a higher dex, it definately seems that I crit more.<br />
<br />
If anyone has any insight into this, I would be more than glad to hear it.  As I said, I am rather new to the game (a true n00b), and some more seasoned insight could be helpful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">07-11-2003, 10:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Welome and hello<br />
<br />
Dex is one of the stats that always looks likes its making a differance until you look at the logs. Heck I used to be a stats warrior (LOL way long ago). Parcing logs has proven that there are no stats that effect to hit. Graffe's also has an archived post from Brad stating that no stats effect to hit--I think under the character creation section.<br />
<br />
The shaman are big on testing that (The Shaman's Crucible) so they are the ones to ask. I would aso add you may want to peruse the library here. I am sure that someone could quote you the change in dex vs proc rate and crits.<br />
<br />
The one thing I have to caution you about is that watching the hit go by is a good way to form very bad impressions (for anything).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khumak</div><div class="date">07-11-2003, 04:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think splitting the ATK number up would do anything for us at this point.  Unless I'm missing something the only factors involved in your chance to hit something are Level, offensive skill, and weapon skill.  So once you cap your skills at level 65 you have the same chance to hit something with a 3000 atk as you do with a 500 atk.  You'll just hit it a lot harder with the 3000 atk.  I seem to remember someone showing that through parses (identical hit percentage at all levels of atk) quite a while ago but I could be wrong.<br />
<br />
To my understanding AC pretty much behaves the same way.  Your chance to be hit is related to level and defensive skills.  AC doesn't matter.  The AC just reduces the amount you'll be hit for if you ARE hit.<br />
<br />
So while ATK and AC may both have separate mods to hit and damage, once our level and skills are capped we can only affect the damage mods so the accuracy component is basically the same for everyone of the same level with their skills maxed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">07-14-2003, 02:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's meaningless to show the AC as its two components because there is very little a player can do to alter his avoidance significantly.  So you'd have one component that basically never changes and the other mitigation component which you can already see currently.  <br />
<br />
Likewise the only part about ATK that can be altered in a significant way is the raw +attack (assuming str is maxed).  The underlying to hit simply can't be modified without items out of Time so what's the point of showing them?  You can already see how your attack changes based on raw attack, and the other components you can alter them anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">07-14-2003, 07:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Which numbers do buffs effect? <br />
<br />
DO cleric buffs add to mitigation or avoidance?<br />
<br />
Does CoP add to to hit or to damage?<br />
<br />
Does agi add to mitigation or avoidance?<br />
<br />
At least all that could be answered easily.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">thrashette</div><div class="date">07-14-2003, 03:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I hate to be a wet blanket, but I was there in beta.  <br />
<br />
Regardless of what Sony said, as far back as the second day of EQ Beta 2, ATK and AC were displayed as XXXX/1000.<br />
<br />
At that time dual wield, riposte, parry, and dodge were not in game.  All weapons said 'hit', and all weapons worked off 1HS skill.  In the second week of beta 2, VI  changed how AC was calculated, leaving the display the same but with new numbers.  A little later they differentiated the weapons skills and made the weapons skill levels add ATK with the right weapon.<br />
<br />
So I think that there's not really anything to return to.  Whatever phase it might have said XXXX/XXXX was long before those two numbers meant what they do today.<br />
<br />
I agree that it would be nice to see a THAC0 type number for to-hit, to-dodge, to-mitigate, and to-parry.  I think such a thing would be a new fabrication rather than any return to an old way, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khumak</div><div class="date">07-14-2003, 05:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think we've already seen parses that show AC has zero effect on hit percentage, same with ATK (assuming max skill level in both cases).  So unless there's a buff that increases skill level AC buffs add only to mitigation (not avoidance) and ATK and STR buffs add only to damage (not hit %).  So if you split the 2 numbers you'd see 1 number that never changed and one that changed according to what gear and buffs you had.  I don't see the value.  It would just confuse people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">07-15-2003, 12:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well then, one locially has to ask, why bother displaying it at all? If there is 0 the player can do to change it, why bother giving it to us?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">thrashette</div><div class="date">07-15-2003, 02:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One of the more interesting things to do is parse a relatively low-AC character in PoP before and after buying Lightning Reflexes.  <br />
<br />
One would think that this  pure avoidance skill would change the number of hits without substantially changing the average hit value for such a player.  After all, he is going to get pummeled for the magic hit number 90% of the time no matter what.<br />
<br />
But what you do see is that the DI index (the 1 to 20 number) spreads out across a lower range as well as there being more dodges and misses.<br />
<br />
That indicates that there is certainly some information that we aren't getting in the display.  My AC hasn't changed but now I am taking less damage. I say WTF?</div></div><hr />
