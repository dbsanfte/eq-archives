I learned from my bard that at these levels I need to keep all skills maxed.  I find it easier to do so with two of the same weapons swinging.  Would you all suggest any upgrades:<br />
<br />
1 Hand Slash Primary:<br />
Centi Longsword<br />
<br />
1 Hand Slash Secondary:<br />
Wakizashi of the Frozen Skies (I like this for the proc)<br />
<br />
2 Hand Slash:<br />
Argent Protector (Amazing damage.  At 30 I had a 350+ Crippling Blow)<br />
<br />
1 Hand Blunt Primary:<br />
Architect's Scepter <br />
<br />
1 Hand Blunt Secondary:<br />
Bed Leg Club<br />
<br />
2 Hand Blunt:<br />
Cant Remember the name but its the one that looks like the big torch.<br />
<br />
1 Hand Pierce Primary:<br />
Shimmering Partisan <br />
<br />
1 Hand Pierce Secondary<br />
Jarsath Trident <br />
<br />
2 Hand Pierce:<br />
Iceflame (Doesnt proc yet :(  )<br />
<br />
Ok thanks for the advice all!</div></div><hr />

My bard is unguilded at the moment so I dont have alot of group options so I guess I am stuck with things I could either buy or solo hunt.</div></div><hr />

INT effects skillups (is that true for warriors, not sure but whatever stat it is make sure you buff it during yur skill up period).<br />
<br />
Frankly I would not waste a lot of time on peircing as there are to few good quality weapons of that sort. Blunt and Slice one and two hand will do you well enough. Later in the game when you find a perciens weapon, if you ever do, you can raise the skill then. You'll be using the drogma weapons more then likely soon enough and one is 1HB and 1HS so Id concentrate on that.</div></div><hr />

It's dex for tanks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Seirnak</div><div class="date">02-24-2004, 01:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I want to reiterate that the secondary hand choice for one hand slash is only because of the proc, its difficult to find a nice slasher that will proc at level 31.  Also I have another one hand slasher (I dont remember the name only that its war only an has one of the necro snare spells as a proc.  It doesnt proc yet so I dont use it.)<br />
<br />
I am actually maxxed in slash and pierce and I need about 20 points to max 1 hand blunt.  Where I am lacking is two hand blunt which is only about 53.</div></div><hr />

You should be able to pick up a Mithril Staff for next to nothing...28/45, and you can use that to work skills.<br />
<br />
No, it's not fast, but I remember using one in Kunark and man that thing cranked back in the day.  Now that we know what we do about the damage you deal having no real effect on aggro, you can use it from skill 0 and you should be able to do just fine with it holding aggro in groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Seirnak</div><div class="date">02-24-2004, 02:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually the two hand blunt I have is 30 something damage and I think 44 delay.  It does some damage but the skill I have sucks.<br />
<br />
I asked about upgrades only because I dont know everything that available out there and I dont want to miss out on something that will make him a better tank.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lidan</div><div class="date">02-24-2004, 06:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Grab a Copper Hammer of Striking and a Sword of the Bloodsworn.  Those 2 weapons will last you well into your 50s even 60s.  They hold agro great with good procs and low delay.  Low delay is very helpful in skilling up DW, DA, and weapon skills.  GL with the weapons.  Those 2 might require some plat farming though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shadowedspawn</div><div class="date">02-24-2004, 06:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kunzar Kunjuch (sp) is the war only sword your thinking of.  Had one on my war and would use it to bow kite gaints in GD.  Melee till snared then bow kite til it wore off.  Rinse Repeat.  If you can get a regen bp or a few regen items you can regen back some of those lost hps before the snare wears off.  <br />
<br />
My war was in his mid 30s when I was doing this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Evariste</div><div class="date">02-24-2004, 09:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Try picking up cheap 18-20-ish delay weapons - the aggro on these is quite impressive for your level. Examples: Crescent Blades of Luclin, Jade Mace, Lamentation, etc. <br />
<br />
Or you can start saving up for a Sword of the Bloodsworn.</div></div><hr />
