I have been hitting HK guards getting 10pp a drop but I heard there was better. Merchant fodder items preferred :) Thanks</div></div><hr />

Might wanna try some ykesha zones, good cash and item drops and probably some exp, if HGs are camped.  Gornit in OOT is also a good piggy bank if he's not camped.<br />

Admittedly, there's alot more good gear out there now, and it's easier to attain, but HG's were a handful for me at 52.  Take a healing partner with you the first time you try it and do some experimenting to see if you need help killing them. If you can handle them, they're good money.  If you end up spending  more of your time sitting and healing than you do fighting, try gnolls in splitpaw and lizards in front of CT, most of those drop at least a few plat and they carry fine steel weapons.</div></div><hr />

At 52, you should be able to solo at least boat 1.  Of course, you probably need an invis to get to the boats &lt;grin&gt;.  But at 52, the spawns have a fairly narrow aggro range, so you can single pull easily, and the loot in Dulak Harbor is pretty great.</div></div><hr />

But at 52 I couldn't.<br />
LoY mobs are good.<br />
If you have a bazaar mule, you also might try going to East K and killing every lion and spider you see, then transfering LQ, MQ and HQ lion pelts (not the skins) and the spider silks to the mule for sale at market price. Very low risk; about the worst thing that can happen is that some L65 druids will be beating you to the spiders.<br />
Another thing you can try is to go to the bottom of Runnyeye and kill every single goblin you see. They seem to drop on average 1-2 pp and either blackened iron or blackened alloy armor/weapons, good for a couple-three more pp each. Obviously, volume is the key here, but there are a lot of goblins around, and it's quite likely you'll be the only player in the zone. Luckily--and this is the real reason a warrior might consider farming here -- there's also a goblin banker on the lowest floor (which is where you'll be hunting) who will let you bank even after your faction couldn't possibly get worse--just don't sit down near him. So there's no need to run long distances to a bank, etc: just drop the armor you loot in your shared bank slots when you are full, switch to alt to vendor it, then repeat cycle. Bring bandages and food and you're good to go. Lord Picklaw and the named batttlewizards (who you can easily solo) also drop the blackened alloy medalian, which is kind of a decent item for young (&lt;lvl 44) caster alts for you or guildmates. They'd probably sell in the bazaar as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If HG are camped I goto mistmoore and mow down everything in the zone. I loot up all the fine steel and bronze and run to the ranger hut in Lesser Faydark and sell. Nets me about 300p per clearing, plus the chance at a couple of items to stick on my bazaar mule and twinks.<br />
<br />
If MM is occupied I try lower guk dead side. I can solo anything except the ghoul lord since I can't get him split from his guards! :mad: If you don't care about your live side faction you can run to the king room and pull to the portal behind the throne. If you get into a bind you can just zone out, heal up and run back down. Oh and invis helps since greenies will agro :)</div></div><hr />
