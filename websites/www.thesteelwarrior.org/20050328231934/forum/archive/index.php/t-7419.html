  EPs are probably easier than hard LDoN for the most part. It really depends on where you are. PoWater is pretty hard some times, because trash can hit for over 1k, often. PoFire, first field, is cake. PoEarth isn't too bad, except the annoying procs and the armadillos. PoAir is a raid zone, in my opinion. Never experience grouped there.</div></div><hr />

First field in fire is considerably easier, and even 2nd field wouldn't be any worse I don't think.  2nd field mobs are comparable difficulty, and much easier to single-pull.  Red stuff deep in water or in the 2nd castle/picnic tables in fire are tougher to tank than LDoN hard I would say, but if you can tank Hard you aren't far off from this stuff with a good healer.<br />
<br />
Have only done 1-group Air once but I don't reccomend it for anyone.  Very painful.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The weaker tier tends to be level 64-65 and is easier than hard LDONs, similar to SolRo trash and krigers in BOT.  Generally hits for 700-900.<br />
<br />
The harder tier is closer to the mountain trials in GoD, the mobs are 66-68 and generally hit for 1200-1400, and are overall harder than hard LDONs.<br />
<br />
PoFire has a third, extra-easy tier of mobs in the first field, which is a total joke in terms of difficulty, and is probably equivalent to the PoValor wasteland.</div></div><hr />
