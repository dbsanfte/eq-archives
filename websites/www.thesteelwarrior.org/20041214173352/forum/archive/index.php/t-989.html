1. SK/Shaman<br />
2. Necro/Mage<br />
3. Necro/Shaman<br />
4. Necro/Necro<br />
<br />
Notice warrior not included, wish it could be. I use a cleric/warrior combo that barely works because warrior has willsapper and belt of marvelous visions, but it works only barely. I have seen SK/Shaman do a lot more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 For melee, Sham/Rogue=D Or monk I guess, but I prefer rogue. Not sure how high ya can go with this but was 2boxing 65sham 58rog tonight really easily. And I suck at 2boxing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rumblingdeth</div><div class="date">06-03-2003, 07:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think I can handle quading with two chars. Summoners is another problem that combo gets destroyed by. I think shaman/necro maybe the best because you have a FD puller, two pets, slow, and TWO healers (people forget necro can heal in a pinch). The DoTs are plain scary too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">06-03-2003, 11:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe, I think duoing quad kiters could be fun.  Just quad with one while the other meds.  Wouldn't be any faster for either char than just quadding alone, but you would be leveling two chars and have way less downtime (assuming one char could finish his quad before the other got FM).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nokmgud</div><div class="date">06-03-2003, 01:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I personally like warrior/shaman best.  Maybe not as fast as a speciallized combo like nercro pally vs. undead, but definitly the most versatile and safest in regards for needed rezzes.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GSW</div><div class="date">06-03-2003, 04:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Warrior/Shaman. Warrior puts out better DPS than a pally or SK, and the pally heals won't be helping much in the planes. If doing non-planar stuff that's not too hard, pally heals will work but the shaman will have mana to heal anyway, so a warrior would work better. The shaman can slow, and is a pretty good healer. And of course, the shammy can buff very well. The duo would be able to take on adds also. Warrior can AE taunt and shammy can root.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">06-03-2003, 04:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">best is relative<br />
probably best leveling combo would be chanter/cleric cause with that you would be NEVER LFG and can duo fine too with charms.<br />
<br />
for mele / healer combo<br />
best probably shamen + any mele pretty much doesnt really matter after slow who the fuck cares who tanking.</div></div><hr />

Of course you will be the most hated mofo in what ever zone you are in, LOL.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ayash</div><div class="date">06-03-2003, 06:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I 2 Box a 65 Druid/Wiz combo- it's pretty awesome for xp gathering but falls over on summoning PoP mobs.<br />
<br />
My gf 2 boxes a druid/shammy combo which i must say is amazing. Basically she can take out a huge range of mobs [basically all of the mobs a shammy can solo but a lot easier]- ornate druid BP/heals/buffs/snare etc all add to the mix</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Binnamar</div><div class="date">06-03-2003, 10:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually 2 boxing a set of quad kiters would be nice constant exp. Kinda like a level 8 wizzy with kei.... never stops goind.<br />
<br />
Druid/wizzy would make a killer money farming duo too :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gerili</div><div class="date">06-04-2003, 02:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">IMO really depends on what you are looking to acomplish with your two box combo.  If you are looking for the best duo combo, best combo for groups, or the best for a raid.  Then you also have ease of use.  Few factors you must concider:<br />
<br />
Your own skill level of being able to two-box is a critical factor.  If your out for soloing, do you want to be able to slaughter the little mobs faster or be able to take down the bigger tougher mobs.<br />
<br />
Personally I believe for a duo combination a necro/shaman would make a very powerful combination because:  1.  Both have the highest mana regen rates of any class in the game.  2.  Abilities compliment each other really well, necros get a strong pet, shaman's get slow and some very good buffs to compliment it. 3.  Both are concidered towards the top of the list on soloing, depending on the situation sometimes the best.  <br />
<br />
If you are talking about a group combination, I would say shaman or chanter/cleric, shaman or chanter/tank, or cleric/tank.  Every group needs 3 key classes to get started, a slower, a tank, and a healer.   After that you just fill in the gaps. Starting off w/ 2 of 3 makes that much easier to get a group started somewhere.  <br />
<br />
For raids really depends on your guilds current situation and what they need.   A cleric/wizard might be extremely powerful in a raid, or a cleric/shaman depending on what your guild currently has.</div></div><hr />
