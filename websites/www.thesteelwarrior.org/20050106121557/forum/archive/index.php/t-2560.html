I recently made an ogre warrior and atm he has a full set of crusty and a centi short sword and a centi warhammer. I was wondering if you guys have any sugestions on some stuff that I could farm with my 52 SK for equipment, or some stuff that isn't too expensive and I could pick up. I would use the search feature but wasn't sure what to type in for soemthing like this, so if it is somewhere pls just tell me where it is.<br />

Thanks<br />

But i think at the time, i came to the conclusion that, although you lose all that stamina, it can be made up with buffs. plus you get additional benefits. it's been a while, so i could be wrong there.<br />
<br />
at the level your running about in crusty these days, sta doesn't pay off much. it starts to pay off 50+ i believe. <br />
<br />
hence the general consensus, levels &gt; gear =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pre-60s your stats aren't going to change much because the mob being slowed isn't AS important and shammies won't be around as often. Therefore your unbuffed stats is what counts, and where Crusty really comes to shine.<br />
<br />
Anyway, the only peice of Crafted that compares to Crusty at all to begin with is the BP, I thought about that for a bit but in the end I went with Crusty.</div></div><hr />

Some of the crafted pieces are damned nice. And you'll end up looking like a bruised blueberry that way. :)</div></div><hr />
