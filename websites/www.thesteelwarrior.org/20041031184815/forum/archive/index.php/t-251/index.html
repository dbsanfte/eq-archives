<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Barja Bardagi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay, guild did Halls of Training two weeks ago, and we're set to go again tomorrow.  I've set my eyes on Vindi, and think we can take him down.  (I view Vindi as a comparable 'level' encounter to fighting in HoT)  My question is this-<br />
<br />
Curently, my weapons are:<br />
2 x Vengeful Honed Blade of the Ykesha (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=15805) <br />
Windblade (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=16695) <br />
Silken Whip of Ensnaring (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=341) <br />
Truncheon of Doom (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=582) <br />
<br />
I've been debating on the strategy to use and the weapon choices.  Here's what I am currently considering...<br />
<br />
After the monks pull Vindi to me/us in the alley corner, have a ranger engage him with Weaponshield, buying me 10-sec for the Cheal cycle to land and me to build agro.  (Have him chain snare and me taunt like mad.)  Once I've got agro (or the ranger dies and Vindi turns to me naturally),  I'll be tanking him Evasive.  Do I try it with the Windblade (DPS/potential DPS agro), the Yaks (speed, ratio, plus a 0.0 Stun proc), or do I go and pick myself up a cheap Barnacle Covered Axe (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=19649) and hope the 100-Hate proc does a good enough job?<br />
<br />
Just looking for some general advice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Korak Sarathai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Back in the day, my guild never bothered with the weaponshield tactic.  Not that it isn't valid, just not really needed.  Definitely run dual ykesha.  Just make sure that no one but the puller and tagger (if you aren't the tagger... some like to use SKs to tag so they can FD out of bag tag)... make sure no one but you and those two people shoot at or otherwise get aggro on Vindi as he is coming in.  Make sure everyone is standing when he gets near camp.  Have the raid give you 10 sec of solo time, and have all the druids and paladins spam you with small heals for the first 10 seconds.  We've found that method to give good results and ensure the CH rotation gets started smoothly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>tarsk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Spam heals and solo time. That's all ya need and you'll be fine. And definitely go Dual Ykesha.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gunrack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">From a newbie warrior I have a couple of questions... when I see you guys recommending him to use the Ykeshas makes sense... now something I am wondering... why use evasive instead of defensive?  And while I am asking that... what situations could you be in that you would rather hit less amounts of times TO BE hit less amount of times rather than just hit for less DMG to take less DMG...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Strikingone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">.13 is right on the line, I wish you luck tho. Myself, I have never done anything but Defensive on Vindi.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ygnir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Me neither, he hits too hard and too fast for my liking, and I actually want him to connect to me, so he kills himself on my DS.<br />
<br />
A tip for Vindi therefor, if you haven't thought about it allready, is to get as much DS as you can... shammy potion + mage DS and get a bard in your group so he/she can sing DS too... at 100-160 damage per hit, Vindi does a pretty good job of killing himself.<br />
<br />
Also make sure you have a healer assigned to the rampage tank, and make sure the rampage tank is someone who can take a beating... (i.e not your favorite cleric casting Cheals at you )<br />
<br />
Some numbers from my last kill:<br />
<br />
DPS on Vindi, on def disc: 209.9<br />
the DS was good for 172.25 of that.<br />
Vindi died be4 my def disc ran out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">1. just make sure your clerics dont sit till 3 rounds of CH<br />
2. go defensive<br />
3. tell your raid when defensive goes out, preferrably before it goes out, and get some spot heals.<br />
4. start chs early, they can duck out if you havent taken dmg.<br />
5. backup tank should be ready, getting agro right away is bad, few wizards should work as roadbumps till the switch is done = p<br />
<br />
the devil is in the details.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>tarsk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I agree on the defensive thing. I like to see him chewing himself up on my DS too, and Ygnir said, he hits just too damn hard and fast for me to risk evasive. With my bad luck from the RNG, he'd land 2 full rounds of max damage quads right at the wrong time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Brudal the Fat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">small heal spams will save you more than anything. Also be ready to tank change and make sure clerics are waiting for it to because most likely he will get the best of you the first few times once defensive drops.<br />
<br />
And I wouldnt use Evasive on Vindi personally. Like everyone said DS will do tons of damage if you stack it up.<br />
<br />
Good luck, he is a good kill to get used to hard melee and cho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Friedrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">First off, let me say it is possible to tank Vindi at 59, I did it.  To this day I have no idea how though as it was prior to the patch which opened up taunt for warriors under 60.<br />
<br />
Personally I would shoot for lvl 60 though first.  It should make your tanking him easier as your taunt should work better and you will gain another 150 or so hps.  In addition, you will gain triple attack (small advantage) and be one lvl closer to Vindi.<br />
<br />
One final piece of advice.  On your first attempt at Vindi, I would use defensive.  Already you don't know what you are up against and throwing in random damage on the main tank would add confusion in my opinion.  The RNG is a harsh mistress.  At least with Defensive you should take a more predictable amount of damage for your clerics to deal with.<br />
<br />
Just a couple thoughts to consider.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Barja Bardagi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Tried him the other night, it was a throw together attempt to see how we did, not really expecting to win.  Well, we didn't.  But, I did attempt him Defensive and I will probably be sticking with Defensive.  It normallizes the damage down to a more reasonable level.  We failed the attempt because the 2nd line healers, to a man, paniced/stunned/awed into forgetting to spam-heal.  I looked at the log though, I survived 10 full seconds from his first hit on the Rune to death.  Initially I was figuring a 2 sec C-Heal rotation, but am now looking at a 4-5 second.  This should stretch healer mana considerably.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the advice everyone and I'll keep you updated on how the attempt goes.  Tonight is Halls of Testing again, and will probably try Vindi Tuesday or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>lelara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Hey warriors,<br />
<br />
In my experiance, Defensive is better for Vindi when we were level 60 (before PoP) but now with our levels, it may have changed a little. I haven't tried evasive since hitting 65 but it would be fun to try if you have good healers.<br />
<br />
Going off topic, I once accidently used Evasive instead of Defensive on Avatar of War (since both hotkeys were next to each other) and take a guess what happened?<br />
<br />
I lived !!!<br />
<br />
I sort of panicked a little but it worked out nicely somehow. I went beserk more often than with Defensive though. So I can assure you too that Defensive for AoW is the way to go...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Galuvian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">If you are still learning the Vindi fight, defnitely use Defensive.  Until your healers are ready to deal with the potential damage spikes from Evasive you should stick with Defensive.<br />

This is from the PoV of a raid leader, but not a warrior.</div></div><hr />
