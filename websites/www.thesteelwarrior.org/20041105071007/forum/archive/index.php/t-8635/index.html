<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">having no experience with it, id guess it would just be alright for aggro, like a BoW or SEWS without their procs. not sure if mana decrease on a proc generates any more hate but aside from any added augs, the only dps youre gonna get is off the ratio and while good for getting really early aggro, probably wouldnt hold it so well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Squizer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Have you ever had an enc steal your aggro when using mana sieve spells ?<br />
Do you know a necro that had to FD after taping a mob's mana ?<br />
<br />
if I answer those 2 questions on my own, I tend to think that the effect on this weapon won't generate a lot of aggro.<br />
<br />
but the only way to know it is to try &amp; parse... ( fight same mob vs someone that has a stun proc on a same dps weapon.. see how often you get aggro on your proc )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mashor Dabashor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">When some of our more agro challenged warriors are tanking big mobs I often see our SeW's wielding knights names pop up in the HoTT box.  I have yet to see the knights with Zun's blade appear.  My conclusion is the agro proc on this weapon is not so hot.  Not hard evidence but enough for me to avoid putting in on this sword.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If knights pull aggro on raids it's from casting group heals, not a wimpy rune III proc on their sword if you ask me.</div></div><hr />

&quot;The proc effect just removes HP and mana and does not confer any on you. Its a nice agro effect roughly on par with Force strike and 150ykesha procs since mobs hate mana reduction more than they do HP reduction after the nuke fixes just prior to PoP. Its still low enough to be easily kept up with by a BoW or dual anger weilding warrior or most Knights. <br />
Not too many pre-time procs have higher damage either for tank classes. <br />
Two thumbs up from me. Now to get one for my Warrior *grin&quot;<br />
<br />
Granted, most of the posters on alla are retards ... so not sure how much validity is in the statment.  I believed him till he pulled out the the &quot;Its still low enough to be easily kept up with by a BoW&quot; ... I'm 100% positive a BoW would run aggro circles around this blade.</div></div><hr />
