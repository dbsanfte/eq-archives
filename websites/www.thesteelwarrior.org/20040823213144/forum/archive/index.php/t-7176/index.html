<br />
I am in the process of trying to create a throwback style guild. The premise of the guild will be to try and play classic content as it was once offered during that specific era. For example, before Kunark only lvl 50 was available and of course there were only certain weapons,items and spells that one could acquire. <br />
<br />
Many people, including myself have bitched and moaned how the original EQ was the best and that the new EQ blows. After quitting the game for the last 10 months, I've decided that it maybe possible to bring some life back into a game that I once loved. <br />
<br />
The goal at this point will be to kill and defeat all eras leading up to and including Velious. By that point I would assume that WoW and perhaps EQ2 would be out and I am holding noone bound to it if they want to explore these new avenues. <br />
<br />
If you think that this idea sounds like something you'd like to participate in, drop by http://p218.ezboard.com/bemeritus and leave me a note. <br />
<br />
Thanks for your time!</div></div><hr />
