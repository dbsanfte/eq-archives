<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kiya</div><div class="date">02-13-2005, 09:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I've run out of ideas on where to dual box with just my cleric and my warrior.  (My enchanter is on the back burner for now, due to medical bills.)  My warrior is flagged up to Earth, air and water.  My cleric only has alt access to tactics and alt access to sol ro in the way of flags.  I've been getting tired of doing the lfg thing and tired of waiting on people so I can go exp.  <br />
<br />
Do you folks have suggestions on where to dual box with a low end elemental tank and a bascially flagless healer bot at 69?   Please don't say sol ro, the sight of that zone makes me want to scream, I've boxed there enough!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">02-15-2005, 10:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The task system isn't horrible.  2-boxing makes them a lot quicker, so you can get both of your toons a task in the same zone and do them together.   Not awesome exp, but they're kind of fun.  I do this with one of the guild clerics from time to time when there's not much goin on and we don't feel like grinding in earth.  Other than that you could try Noble's Causeway.  I don't think it's great exp either but I know some 2-3 boxers that like that zone for grinding AA.  Catacombs of Dranik could be good too, but I think you need 3 to start them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kiya</div><div class="date">02-16-2005, 12:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh, waza, look in my sig.  Gameon.  Pretty gimped char, I know.<br />
As for the task system, the selection at level 69 is pretty low.  I get to choose from a whopping *2* tasks.  I'd rather not go into the deepest parts of veksar alone.  It would just be an assured corpse run.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">02-16-2005, 10:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There should be a lot more than two tasks for you on the OT taskmaster.  There are at 70 anyway.  He gives tasks to nurga/droga and chardok as well as Veksar IIRC.   There is also a taskmaster in the DL and one in ......gunthak I think that gives LoY tasks.  You would be suprised how easy it is to crawl through Veksar these days.  And your cleric can CR in there easily, just need a couple invis pots and to pay attention to the spots where it changes from live to undead, but frankly, unless you are being totally reckless you shouldn't die in there.  Tanking 2 or even 3 of those things as a level 69 is pretty trivial with a cleric healing you.  <br />
<br />
I don't know, they're not for everybody, but I kind of think it's fun to go crawl through old dungeons with some goal outside of the light blue exp kills.  They are designed to be done solo, and I have soloed some of them although it was non-trivial for me to do.  With a healer bot though they are a piece of cake.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Terrya Anuuazz</div><div class="date">02-16-2005, 12:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I haven't done any of the tasks, I 2-box a cleric as well (I'm a beastlord though, so I have slow).  I'd have to say that the suggestions of Droga and Griegs end are among the best for easy decent experience and semi-decent loot for tribute/vendor/some bazaaring.  One of my more favorite spots lately however has been Noble's Causeway.  There are several very very nice camps for 2-boxing there.  Even with my poor tanking skills, my cleric (who is also gimp beyond belief) can chain CH's on me and rarely get below 70 mana (I use a drogmar for the cleric, SA and cleric self buff for mana regen-he rarely ever has C).  Even without slow, a cleric should be able chain CH on you through most anything in Nobles (I've had a few nameds bounce slow until they turned to run, so if I can tank one unslowed, it should be considerably easier for a warrior).  There are many camps in NC that have at least 1 and sometimes more named or PH's within a close proximity and they drop some decent things to include Runes as well as well as some of the minor OoW Tier 1 quest armor no-drop peices (wrist/boots/head is what I've found so far in NC).  My normal routine when I log on is to go to Nobles Causeway with my cleric, find an open camp, throw up LFG and start killing and getting EXP and runes while I'm waiting for a better group in MPG, RCoD or RS.  I've found that I *can* 2 box in WoS, but it causes more pinching of my seat cushion than it is worth.  Nobles Causeway is decent exp, non-trivial mobs, and some decent loot, especially while waiting for the nicer camps in the higher zones.<br />
<br />
Get an extended C for the cleric, and you should do just fine in Nobles Causeway.  And unless you bring a slower with you, take advantage of some DS potions for the extra DPS since you'll be battling unslowed.... just start those CH's early... I know for me, I will start a CH as I get the mob in camp even before I've taken damage if my first slow bounced, then continue the chain as necessary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daabu</div><div class="date">02-16-2005, 12:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like camping in Bloodfields (when it's not lagging to high hell there).  At the Dranik's Scar, it's essentially soloable mobs but downtime is required every so often.  The exp isnt phenominal there for a group of two, but if you go to the RCoD side, there are more blue cons.<br />
<br />
The mobs are dragorns, and seem to drop magnetized / augments at a low but steady rate.  The cash in general is nice there (I think I've made close to 1k/hr from the gems etc that drop, plus I average one magnetized/aug per hour).<br />
<br />
If you fight in the middle area, they're easy to get in single or 2-pulls, they're easy enough that even a non-EP warrior could probably take them with a cleric bot, and they con low-dark-blue to a warrior. <br />
<br />
Buffs are nice, but not necessary.  If I were you, though, I'd either use Kizrak's gaunts or get some sort of haste.  Clicky DSes are nice as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callon</div><div class="date">02-17-2005, 09:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">DoN has a lot of tasks you could probably try.  As usual of course the vast majority of solo warriors could never hope to do the level appropriate tasks.  Go slaughter mobs in Stillmoon?  riiiiiight....<br />
<br />
But with a boxed cleric you could probably manage it.</div></div><hr />
