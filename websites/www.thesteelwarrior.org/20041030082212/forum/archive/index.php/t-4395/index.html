<br />
Check out the new shoes! Got them in an LDON last night, I know they ain't much, but hey, it makes my feet that much cooler!<br />
<br />
Anyway, haven't done this in like 10 levels, so I thought I would get some feedback, I am nearing that 1000AC mark Shik! Aren't you proud of me! Remember when I first came here 30 levels (and 6 months or so ago) wearing a Serpentine Bracer (1 AC, LOL)<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'm not rich, I go for drops, I have some items in mind, just tell me what you think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">woot :D ( sorry magelo is blocked here at work so no help :( )<br />
just passing along the woot...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jakle Attakle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Magelo is blocked for me too, can someone explain what exactly is happening that we only get symbols and stuff?<br />
<br />
We are on Win XP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">dunno; but it's something (don't quote me here) to do with sites with the java_coding and corporate internet security systems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Donnel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I got that until I uninstalled and reinstalled IE, up to version 6<br />
<br />
It cleared all the symbols up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">you gear is fine to go hit kael or temple of veeshan up for some thurg or ss armours :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Donnel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Cool :)<br />
<br />
So I have gear suitable for my level then?<br />
<br />
That's a confidence booster.<br />
<br />
To tell you the truth, I am skipping (only because I don't have people to hit up SS and HoT with) those armours for now in favor of getting points in Takish Hiz.<br />
<br />
Even If I only get one piece of Royal Attendent, I think it will be time well spent.<br />
<br />
Especially since the wife and I REALLY enjoy doing the missions, and it's good experience for the time invested.<br />
<br />
Now that my endorsement has ended, any other thoughts?</div></div><hr />
