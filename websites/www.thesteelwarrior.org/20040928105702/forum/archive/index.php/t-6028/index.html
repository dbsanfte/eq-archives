<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>JAFFO</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">First why did I post this message on this board, I wanted to know the opion of the warrior community.<br />
<br />
  I have nothing against class balance, I do think that classes should have an equal use although it may not be in the same way. <br />
<br />
NOW /rant on<br />
<br />
 I have been playing EQ since 99, and in that time I have seen the game shift severly, some of those changes for the good some for the bad; However I am getting fucking fed up with all the damn hybrids and fuck necks believing that they should be equal to specialist classes. Every damn one of them does some stupid fucking parse that is set up to show what they want. And over the course of the last few months I have seen one to many post about how &quot;Holy Trinty&quot; are  GOD classes, these fucking idiots have zero clue, they want all thier special tools, and tricks and also be able to do every damn thing equal (and hell some want to be better) to the classes they take peneties for have those abilities. I am a cleric, and every damn class with a healing spell thinks they need to be able to heal in almost any situation, except raids of course, the only fucking reason they dont want to heal on raids is the fact that it sucks, they want to be able to nuke or tank or something more interesting, but they also want to heal like a cleric so when they want to group they can replace us. No they dont want to stand in the cheal chain since that is to boring for them,  so basically they want to have every heal I have and keep them in the back of thier spell books until they need them to replace me any time they wish. <br />
 <br />
  After reading all the post about how unfair it is for a cleric to be the only valid healer in the high end zones, and how it is unfair that a warrior is needed to tank in the high end zones. I wish they would just go fuck off, they dont like clerics then fuck you, you dont like warrios then fuck you etc etc. Why do they beleive they have the right to have all of our class specific abilities without taking the penelties that come with those abilities. If they played to 65 (most probably bought the damn chars) then they understand the strengths and weakness with each class and if they wanted the abilities of a specialist class then they need to delete the worthless char they are playing (according to them they are all gimp and usless) and make a warrior or cleric, at the char select screen we made our choses you made yours so STFU or hit the damn delete key.<br />
<br />
/rant off<br />
<br />
  Yes I know I am rambling but you get the idea of what I am saying. Sorry for creating a post on your boards but I wanted to know what the warrior community had to say.<br />

&quot;Every damn class &lt;&lt;That Wears PLATE&gt;&gt; thinks they need to be able to &lt;&lt;TANK&gt;&gt; in almost any situation, &lt;&lt;INCLUDING&gt;&gt; raids of course,  they also want to be able to &lt;&lt;RES/HAVE A COOL HORSE/HEAL/SELF BUFF ETC&gt;&gt; or something more interesting &lt;&lt;LIKE ALL THE WARR DISCIPLINES&gt;&gt;, but they also want to &lt;&lt;TANK&gt;&gt; like a &lt;&lt;WARRIOR&gt;&gt; so when they want to group they can replace us.&quot;<br />

<br />
There is a difference between &quot;wanting to tank/heal as well&quot; as the specialist class, and wanting to be as valuable as the specialist in the tank/heal position. Knights shouldn't tank as well as warrior, but they should bring enough other things to the table that they are just as valuable in the tanking role. Druids shouldn't heal as well as clerics, but the entirety of their skillset should make them as valuable as a cleric in the healing role (technically, you can debate this, since you could compare the druid to a DPS class rather than a cleric). All the classes should be valuable and viable in their roles. &quot;You picked a hybrid, you should have known you were going to suck.&quot; is not good game design.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 No that isn't what i am saying at all. Every class has abilities that are unique to them and important. What I am saying is that if a class feels that they are useless and unwanted (which 99% of the time is BS anyway) the first thing they do is start preaching about &quot;HOLY TRINITY&quot; and how warriors, and clerics are over powered, and they feel that they should be equal to a clerics healing and a warriors tanking, without every taking into consideration the tools they have that we dont. They preach about class balance using one encounter, or spell set  as an example to attempt to prove thier point about how they are underpowered while the warriors , clerics are overpowered; However they never take into considration the fact that if they got thier way then the specialist class would have nothing. I think that instead of attempting to neautrilize another class maybe they should be focusing on their class taliored abilities, for if they are underpowered then that would be the area to improve. I do not wish to play a game of cookie cutter class's that overlap to the point that thier is no longer a difference.<br />
<br />
[i]Ding You have become better at looking like an idiot (250) congrats Jaffo!!!!<br />

<br />
 And no that isnt what I want either, I also think that every class should be wanted, I would also love to see it to where you could grab any 6 class's and have an equal chance of success. What I am refering to is the fact that all I ever see are post's to where melee_1 feels they are underpowered and usless thus they should be given all the warrios /disc, caster_01 feels they are underpowered thus should have all the cleric heals, and yes that has annoyed the hell out of me, gimmel said it best, <br />
<br />
[i]wanting to tank/heal as well&quot; as the specialist class, and wanting to be as valuable as the specialist in the tank/heal position..[/B]<br />
<br />
 And to add to that though i think that thier should be encouters that require abilities unique to different class's, to where YES the warrior should be the prefered tank on a boss mob, but also thier should be encouters that a knight would be prefered etc etc etc.<br />
Preaching about wanting every usful tool that is unique to a specialist  class solves nothing and is just annoying, and irritating.</div></div><hr />

Like...? Knights are tanks, druids are healers. They should be able to actually do their jobs. Do they do it in a different way? I would hope so, that's what makes classes different. But to say that druids shouldn't be able to heal and knights shoudln't be able to tank for relevant single group content because they aren't &quot;specialists&quot; is a bad, bad idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>JAFFO</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I agree 100% gimmel, that is a bad thing. However the knights, and other priests do not need warrior and cleric abilities to ensure that they can do thier primary jobs. Lets take knights for example, they think they need warrior /disc to allow them to tank, I do not agree with that at all, I feel that warriors should be the prefered tanks on the high end encouters, and that all tanks should be equaly desired when it comes to groups. However I think that if the knights are truly behind warriors in thier ability to tank then they should be fixed via spells, not given all thw warrior abilities. And like I said what irritates and annoyes the hell out me is everyone saying how they deserver warrior ability_01 or cleric ability_02.</div></div><hr />

Except that isn't what almost anyone is asking for. They want the COMBINATION of physical tanking ability PLUS the spellbook to add up to a tank package that is equally valuable as a warrior. Same value, different ways of getting there.<br />

In general I totally agree, I think that in general knights asking for defensive is not a good idea, but then again I don't think defensive is a very good thing for the game in general. But to be honest I really wish that there was a LOT less specialization in this game, and a lot more ability of different classes to fill the various roles. I would GLADLY give up a lot of the cleric's relative superiority in healing in exchange for a more interesting toolset like the other priests have. That's why my cleric is pretty much a bot these days, and why I got so bored with my warrior alt. Being really good at one thing and one thing only gets really old.</div></div><hr />

  No where in my post do I say or imply that. I said that each class should be equal and bring thier unique abilities to bare. And that saying  that they should just copy warrior /disc and give them to every melee, and copy all the cleric heals and give them to everyone with a spell book, does irritate and piss me off, I am sorry that you aren't the GOD class that you wish to be, but a little news flash for you neither are we, contrary to your delisional beliefs.</div></div><hr />

See it's because of those comments that I posted that. I'm not saying YOU per say, but the crux of the matter is this. If a hybrid asks for an upgrade in either of their parents field of excellence, we are considered whiners and or told we want to be Gods. NM whether or not those changes are warranted.<br />
<br />
Now consider the following:<br />
<br />
Warrior: 1 trick pony <br />
Cleric: 1 trick pony <br />
Paladin: Combination of both<br />
SoE: Refusal of using originality for the class<br />
<br />
Problem: Upgrading either side pisses off the parent class because it infringes upon their sole purpose. <br />
<br />
Solution: SoE introduces a new class. :)</div></div><hr />

   Thier are ways to create balance with coping warrior /disc's or the cleric spell book. An example of this (and I am not a melee so please understand I know thier are flaws in this just using it as an example), instead of adding to the pally what about adding something to the warrior that will increase the desirablity of a knight in those high end GoD groups. A warrior ability that he can use and add a buff to another melee that will take all agro generated from the knight and transfer it to the warrior. Think about it, the warrior stands and goes defensive while the knights use thier ability to draw snap agro. This would also be a great benifit to the group as a whole since the hate added to the warrior via the knight would be enough to decrese thechance of the healer drawing agro. And as for the priest healing thing add a debuff line to druids that prevents the mitagation of disease based slows, you could flag the raid tgt's immune to this effect to prevent it from being used outside of groups. With that ability since shamans are the only ones that use disease based slows it would increase the desirability of both class's, since druids + shaman could count slow into the healing equation effectively where as enchanter and cleric would still have the issue. So a group would have to truly think about which class to bring to aencouter. <br />
<br />
 I know thier are flaws in those examples, but I think they get my point across.</div></div><hr />

You seen a cleric QUAD? I started EQ in 1999 PUPS, when EVERYONE soloed, and if you couldn't, you made no progress in the game. No tank got groups, Rangers tanked them all. Then the spoiled people that post most of the Knight bitches started in Kunark, you aren't old school. Yk's and Mithrals were UBER, and most of my play time was then. Go ahead, delevel and solo in crafted with no haste, old school style. EQ is for BABIES now, you are all dr00ds.<br />
Your the one whining about ONE SET OF TRIALS, WITH NO MAGELO STILL. I want the time repaid is all that I could have soloed like an SK, and want all the pp too, with interest. The first one with 1 million pp on the server was an Enchanter who Charm kited in original EQ. Yea, soloers made phat pp to set themselves on easy street.

i hope you aren't reffering to me with all the yous. for one you know nothing about me and when i started to play. for another thing i didn't say shit about the trials. my comment was about you tring to twist everything into a &quot;they can solo i can't at all&quot; line when it isn't true. no i didn't say where to solo at, or if it was as good as others exp when they solo. the point is that it can be done. that it has been done.<br />

The Knight argument is just as dumb as requesting warriors be altered to be able to exp like the kiters can.<br />
Since you STILL aren't getting it, they would have to make Warriors a guy with the big ole &quot;S&quot; on his chest to do this, exactly what Knights are asking for when they ask for tools to do the single group trials!</div></div><hr />

Either Paladins tank or they shouldn't bother trying.  It sounds like you favor the abandoning tanking.  That is fine as your opinion but you'll have to forgive me if I think that is a stupid thing to do.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Either Paladins tank or they shouldn't bother trying.<br />
It sounds to me that being able to tank all content up to the very latest content doesn't validate a paladin as a tank in your mind Aeka?<br />
<br />
The release of GoD hasn't effected class make up in any big way, a few more AAs, a couple more spells but in terms of class balance what is making knights less favorable to warriors as tanks is the content, not changes to the class.  If paladins were acceptable as tanks 3 months ago and the class hasn't been nerfed in anyway why is it all or nothing now?  <br />
<br />
Every trial I have done has had an SK in the group for their other abilitys aswell as a backup tank, if it was the other way round there is no way a warrior could justify taking that spot.  I can't FD split, my DPS and especially burst DPS don't compare at all, I can't FD and assist with CR on a wipe, I can't agro an add off a chanter after a mez resist without damaging the mob to allow it to be mezzed again.  I can act as a 2nd tank if the primary tank goes down, but why take me for that role when your other option brings so much more.<br />
<br />
If a knight could tank this with equal survivability to a warrior then the knight would become the 1st choice to use as a tank.<br />
<br />
While I do think the difference in difficulty between a warrior and a knight tanking these trials is excessive I also think that knights have a good amount of utility that gives them value to a group despite their ability to take the damage.<br />
<br />
The examples I gave above were SK utility rather than paladin utility because I almost always group with an SK and I didnt want to list examples from both classes and fall into the trap of illustrating knights as a single class.  I can think of some pretty good reasons to take Paladin's on trials too beyond having a 2nd tank (which I personally like to have anyway).  A secondary rezzer is the most obvious and very useful to have, a paladin can work well as a backup healer in place of a druid, especially if the group has an enchanter or bard slower instead of a shaman, offtank and root CC are also part of the paladin package.<br />
<br />
I'm not adverse to some changes to the trials to make them more knight tankable though I would like to see warriors maintain a tanking advantage.  I don't think there is any reason here to start adding knight abilities because knights don't feel like tanks anymore when they when 3 months ago they had held the #1 tanking spot for 18months and the classes themselves havent changed.</div></div><hr />

I gave up the ability to  buff, heal others, GRC, root adds, Res, and get a free $#@^% horse for 4 years to be a member of the BEST Tank class in the game. Read the Class Descriptions sometime if you don't know by know what the differences between the two classes are.<br />
<br />
A Paladin is NOT entitled to be a Warrior with a Spellbook.<br />
<br />

BB I think you need some sleep :)<br />
<br />
Combination of tank + spellbook to equal the package value of a warrior does NOT equal being a warrior. It equals the VALUE of a needed class role.<br />
<br />
BTW, would you get off the fucking horse already. We didn't ASK for the fucking thing, we don't give a SHIT that we have it, or that all the other fucking classes might get it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
thing is you aways say that you have a unfair weakness in &lt;insert singled out part of a knight class&gt; <br />
<br />
and if your class was that one thing, you might have a point (like warriors are tanks, and that is all)<br />
<br />
most of the paladins and SKs who bitch the loudest aways sport a lengthy parse of ONE aspect, that works for pure classes, not hybrids, YOU MUST consider all parts that make up the whole, yes your heals may not be the best, but your not a paper tank, and yes your buffs may get over written but so can cleric, ranger, sk and other pure/hrbrids spells<br />
<br />
get over yourself, relise your class isnt just a 1 trick pony like mine is</div></div><hr />

There is no problem at all when Knights look at one of opprotunities in an experaince group and want to be in it, that's perfect. But that does not mean that they have to tank like a Warrior or heal like a Shaman. Bestlords, Rangers, etc. get groups. What are they the &quot;best&quot; at? Is a Ranger really a the best melee DPS in the game? I don't think so.<br />
<br />
If in fact Paladins concidered themselves as total packages and didn't try to resolve every problem they faced by either advocating that a Warrior capability be nerfed or that they get a Warrior capability there would be a lot less friction.<br />
<br />
The Phase 1 Melee changes happened and YOU are still talking about the fact that you think Warriors shouldn't have gotten the &quot;-1 DI&quot; change. Why don't you take a chill pill? With Warriors having 1500 to 2k more buffed HP's now than most PoTime Paladins and &quot;-1 DI&quot;, and Defensive it isn't like the two classes are in competition over survivability - and they never should have been.<br />

<br />
BB that's the biggest bunch of BS you can come up with. The survivability issue that you say shouldn't be balanced between our 2 classes isn't just in question vs named mobs. Expansions SCALE from easy to harder and since you're in Kod'Taz+ I am SURE you are aware that the mobs in ferubi sure as fook don't hit as hard as the ones in KT. Why? because the game difficulty is scaling. <br />
<br />
Now here's a trick question for you.<br />
<br />
Are mobs being offtanked in higher GoD or are they being CC'ed (mezzed)?<br />
<br />
<br />
My original argument about the -1DI changes were in direct response to the warrior belief that it had nothing to do with the mob setup of GoD that was approaching. Warriors saying that it was to put a greater gap between them and knights pre GoD is idiotic and you know it. The -1DI does NOTHING to change the roles war/knights had in PoP or before.<br />

Paladins don't solo. Not saying they couldn't, but there's just no friggin POINT in it. <br />

And AGAIN, P A C I F Y works up to lvl 55 mobs P E R I O D. Now if your paladin is soloing pre 55 then I need to argue I know warriors that soloed in velk at 60 before dinging 61 to do aa's.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Correct, we weren't given the -1 DI change because paladins were tanking better than we were.  It was because they were tanking just as well as we were in situations that did  not require defensive.  News Flash for you, you're not supposed to tank as well as we do.  Tanking is all we do, it is the sole function of our class.  If you tank as well as we do, you should be expected to give up your entire spellbook in order to balance our classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>exeter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">So far as Pallies are concerned my now dated understanding of the class might still be workable:<br />

Not a great tank - but probably the best class for grabbing aggron in the game.<br />
<br />
That role can have a lot of strategic value.  Warriors are better tanks - but aggro control is tougher.  The reverse should be true of Knights (SKs).<br />
<br />
#1  Maybe the ability of Knights to grab aggro needs to be heightened - to accentuate their role in this capacity.<br />
<br />
#2  In a role play context - perhaps Knights should be given an enhanced version of the warrior /shield ability to protect casters and other vulnerable classes in the group.<br />
<br />
Maybe the intended role of a knight in the first place needs to be re-visisted:  they are the ultimate protectors ---&gt; they provide rapid interim aggro control protecting weak party members until aggro is brought under control where the warrior can tank one mob at a time.</div></div><hr />

If you can't hold agro you arent tanking, so therefore holding agro better is a factor in tanking better.  <br />
<br />
If you want to read some of the arguements about tanking during pop I recommend reading every post ever made in the war room and searching this forum for posts about tanking and paladins... theres a lot of discussion there and while some of its good it doesnt need to be posted again.</div></div><hr />

Really. So where pray tell does this put non plate classes tanking xp groups all over the place in every expansion except GoD? You're saying knights (plate) were too close to you, yet PoTime has been tanked by chain/leather/silk wearers. <br />
<br />
Explain to me the logic that a knight, which is a tank class, should not be close to a warrior, but complete non tank classes should be close to knights.<br />

Sigh, how many TIMES must we go through this.<br />
<br />
Yes BOTH combined equal proper tanking. The POINT is that warriors HAD the greater survivability even before the phase 1 changes, what they didn't have was the aggro generation. The provoke line was a GOOD thing, but the provoke line itself was ALL that was required to make all 3 tanks balanced within the xp setting, the dmg mitigation change was not required.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>lokkak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Taragor,<br />
<br />
I am losing more and more respect for you as the days pass.<br />
<br />
1) Before the -1DI change, Paladins tanked identically to warriors.<br />
<br />
2) Warriors had from 100 to 200 hp advantage (unless you would like to throw out your spell book which you seem to be fond of doing.)<br />
<br />
3) Paladin AC wearing identical gear was within a few percent off warrior AC, and unless you break a 50 AC step, there hasn't been shown to be any improvements.  Combine this with many Paladins may opt for 1H + Shield and not lose any agro (due to spell book) their AC is often higher than a Warrior.<br />
<br />
4) Incite is not the wonder fix like a stun on pull and stun when the mob gets into camp.  When I play with a good Paladin, agro is completely trivial.  Even with all the new tools a Warrior has, you can not tash as soon as the mob is in range, and slow as soon as your spell gems pop without getting agro like you can with a &quot;good&quot; Paladin.<br />
<br />
Personally, the -1DI didn't do squat.  It certainly isn't much different than adding a few more percent (3 to 5 at best) more HP, so if you think 500 HP from -1DI plus 500 HP from Sturdiness makes warriors the Superman, you can think that, but it simply isn't true.  Now -5DI and leave defensive a net of 50 percent, that would have done something.  None of this addresses the fact that a &quot;good&quot; Paladin would STILL be able to play in exp places with no healer (no cleric, no druid) due to stun damage mitigation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Taragor,<br />
<br />
I'm going to explain it all to you the best I can. IF you or anyone else believes I'm incorrect feel free to disagree,<br />
<br />
You understand that a Cleric is The Prime Healer I hope.<br />
<br />
Warriors are The Primary Tank. If you read the Warrior description you see what we call Tank defined. You see that Warriors are to be &quot;.....unmatched in the ability to survive the most brutal battles.&quot; Defensive, &quot;-1 DI&quot;, and greater HP's all give a Warrior advantages vs. the most hard hitting high DI mobs that is not to be matched by other classes - not by their tanking abilities and not by their tanking abilities augmented by their spellbook - unmatched.<br />
<br />
Verant/SoE has placed limits on a Warrior's supremacy in tanking. In the most brutal battles it is unmatched. As battles get less and less brutal (to the point where defensive is no longer necessary) Warriors still have a survival advantage but it's impact trails off. <br />
<br />
Once brutal mobs eventually become trivial - that's one way progression is experianced. Such mobs can and are tanked by non-Warriors. Raid Adds with their generally much lower DI are traditionally tanked by Knights. And in normal experiance groups the three plate tank classes are pretty much interchangable.<br />
<br />
Warriors aren't too concerned by non-Plate tanks. Our intended niche is unmatched survivability vs. high DI mobs. That's why the survivability changes were needed - to insure that our survivability vs. such mobs exists and can not be readily matched.<br />
<br />
Our advantage increases as DI goes up and trails off as DI goes down. <br />
<br />
The &quot;-1 DI&quot; change has neglegable effect on experiance group tanking where the goal is to move the experiance bar as quickly as possible with the least amount of risk.<br />
<br />
***The Warrior Survivability Advantage not only functions as intended, but it functions as it should.***<br />
<br />
Now, if it can be shown that high-level members of some classes can not participate in GoD because of the way SoE designed it, particularly the trials, then either adjustments in the classes affected or changes in the encounters are in order.<br />
<br />
Suggestions ranging from a Knight version of Weaponshield to adjusting mob DB and DI values have been made.<br />
<br />
IMO, since superior survivability is the central attribute of Warriors as The Primary Tank, any &quot;burst mitigation&quot; changes to Knights should preserve it in a way that matters - an advantage vs. high DI mobs encountered during progression.<br />
Though the Paladin and SK will never equal the warrior in their ability to taunt...some of the taunting spells should help them become more effective tanks. - The EverQuest Team <br />
After all of these changes, hybrids will not be able to deal out the damage of a pure melee class, with the possible exception of rangers, who might be able to get close. The warrior, monk and rogue will still out damage hybrids, and by a noticeable margin. That difference is in part what hybrids lose for the power of their spells.<br />
<br />
Also, warriors will always have the broadest selection of weapons and armor.<br />
<br />
Warriors will still have a significantly larger amount of hit points.<br />
<br />
Their role as primary tank will not be endangered. - Absor 10/01<br />

1) Before the -1DI change, Paladins tanked identically to warriors.<br />
<br />
Which setting are we speaking of?<br />
<br />
Raid: Until a zone/lvl/expansion is being farmed for gear and paladins gear up in that equipment, warriors are the only MT's (A few exceptions to this rule). This is as it should be.<br />
<br />
Xp setting: In an xp group there should never be a time where a warrior is the only capable class to MT. All gear/lvl being equal of course. <br />
<br />
<br />
2) Warriors had from 100 to 200 hp advantage (unless you would like to throw out your spell book which you seem to be fond of doing.)<br />
<br />
I never disputed that knights and warriors were not close in their ac/hp comparisons. I do have a question I'd like answered from the warriors though.<br />
<br />
Why must there be a  gap in hp/ac difference between knights/wars *if* warriors have greater survivability from skills/aa/discs/dmg mit?<br />
<br />
This is not a whine, I would honestly like to have peoples true opinion on this. <br />
<br />
3) Paladin AC wearing identical gear was within a few percent off warrior AC, and unless you break a 50 AC step, there hasn't been shown to be any improvements.  Combine this with many Paladins may opt for 1H + Shield and not lose any agro (due to spell book) their AC is often higher than a Warrior.<br />
<br />
I'm not arguing what you're saying but there are risks and drawbacks to using a 1h/shield combo when tanking, especially in a raid situation.<br />
<br />
<br />
Personally, the -1DI didn't do squat.  It certainly isn't much different than adding a few more percent (3 to 5 at best) more HP, so if you think 500 HP from -1DI plus 500 HP from Sturdiness makes warriors the Superman, you can think that, but it simply isn't true.  Now -5DI and leave defensive a net of 50 percent, that would have done something.  <br />
<br />
-1DI is not alot. True. -1DI added to other mitigation factors then compounded to an expansion that uses it to it's fullest extent means alot more. This is why I said that the change pre GoD had no real affect. In GoD though where mobs DI value is so great it means a difference on every single hit so it's cumulative effect is much greater.<br />
<br />
None of this addresses the fact that a &quot;good&quot; Paladin would STILL be able to play in exp places with no healer (no cleric, no druid) due to stun damage mitigation. <br />

<br />
Posted by Battleblade<br />
Our advantage increases as DI goes up and trails off as DI goes down.<br />
<br />
Consider the last 3 expansions (PoP,LDoN,GoD) it is undeniable that SoE has progressively gone to higher and higher DI mobs. <br />
<br />
So though you would have more balance with a mix of<br />
<br />
-Low DB hi DI mobs<br />
-Hi DB low DI mobs<br />
<br />
that is not the case. Perfect example would be warrior type mobs having hi DI and caster type mobs having low DI. Unfortunately, caster mobs in EQ hit as hard as warriors.<br />
<br />
*Just thinking about this now as I'm responding. An approach SoE should have considered was making caster mobs very weak vs stuns with only named casters having any stun immunity. This in itself would give paladins an actual possibility at a 2nd role in a 1 group setting. Combine the 2 types of mobs in dungeons/event/trials and you have greater need for multiple classes. (tweaking to eliminate stun lock can be easily done)<br />
<br />
Suggestions ranging from a Knight version of Weaponshield to adjusting mob DB and DI values have been made.<br />
<br />
IMO, since superior survivability is the central attribute of Warriors as tanks, any &quot;burst mitigation&quot; changes to Knights should preserve it in a way that matters - an advantage vs. current content high DI mobs encountered during progression.<br />
<br />
IMO Raid named should have never been tankable for more than a short period of time by any class except warriors using defensive. <br />
<br />
-Warriors should have the only /defensive disc<br />
-Knights should have a very short duration parry type ability while wielding a shield (could be further hindered by draining the mana bar)<br />
-Non tank type classes should have no discs to mitigate any kind of dmg<br />
<br />
Before this is seen as a whine, or nerf, or wanting to be in God mode I do have a reasoning as to why I'd suggest the above and it has nothing to do with my being able to outtank a warrior.<br />
<br />
As for your quotes from SoE BB, I have issues with those considering they were written 2 1/2 years ago. Alot has changed since in the content design of the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Taragor,<br />
<br />
I have read no statement from Verant/SoE counterdicting the quotes supplied. The interview with the SoE spokesman where he specifically identified the changes as &quot;needed&quot; is much more recent. The Class Descriptions were updated about 4 months ago.<br />
<br />
Let's be a little honest - you have dismissed statements about the Phase 1 Melee Changes and Warriors as The Primary Tank, not because they aren't Verant/SoE's intention or what they said, but because you don't want it to be the case.<br />
<br />
The HP advantage is needed because not all damage in brutal battles is melee. Defensive and the &quot;-1 DI&quot; change is melee damage only. The Warrior brutal battle advantage is intended to be somewhat general with exceptions notable because they are exceptions - Griegg for example.<br />
<br />
Outside of raids, the Warrior survivability advantage still provides preference for Warriors when a party hunts high DI mobs.<br />
<br />
A Paladin's advantages provides preference when the party's main healer is a Druid or Shaman, when multiple adds are frequent and must be controlled, etc.<br />
<br />
In normal experiance goups, these advantages are very marginal. In some of the one group ring events, the Paladin advantages are pretty overwhelming. In some one group events like LDon Hard Assassinate Warriors enjoy an advantage. In others like some of the GoD trials, a great advantage.<br />
<br />
6 Wizards can take out dragons. A single Shaman can solo in WW.<br />
<br />
The objection to GoD trials should be based not on the fact that Warriors have an advantage in brutal battles or some classes are able to do things easily with smaller numbers but rather that the trials themselves are not fair.<br />
<br />
A 6-person mandatory trial with 20 adds that must be AE'd is not fair. One with high DI bosses that can't be accomplished with a Knight contributing to the group's success is unfair. One with a steady stream of summoned adds that must be banished is unfair.<br />
<br />
That's one issue.<br />
<br />
The apparent inability of some classes to participate in farming these 6-person instances is the other.<br />
<br />
Warrior aggro control and survivability is immaterial, as is Cleric superiority in high damage situations to provide the necessary healing to the MT.<br />
<br />
It's the trial.<br />
<br />
I'm pretty defensive about Warrior preference vs. brutal mobs. But I am convinced Knights should have a &quot;burst mitigation&quot; ability totally separate from the ability to successfully MT in the trials as they currently are implimented. I would prefer it if it could be accomplished with Paladin heals and stuns and SK lifetaps since I think this is much more in class character. But I can understand either approach.  Just not comparable to a Warrior's Defensive discipline. <br />
<br />
I also believe the always present Warrior melee mitigation should be adjusted to &quot;-2 DI&quot; and all other plate wearers receive &quot;-1 DI&quot; to distinguish Plate from non-Plate armor.<br />
<br />
I also believe strongly that mob damage has outpaced backup and spot healing and those classes filling those roles should get improved healing.<br />
<br />
But I do not believe Paladins should be Warriors.<br />
<br />
I doubt that I can answer your questions or address your reservations to your satisfaction. I don't believe that this is because my explanations are inconsistant with the way things are and what Verant/SoE has said - it's because you don't like the answers and what they mean.<br />
<br />
On PoN those with other beliefs and perhaps an agenda of &quot;Tank Parity&quot; not supported by class description or SoE/Verant's statements can say anything to avoid honest discussion. Here in the TSW Outhouse we have higher standards. Thank you for meeting them in your last post.<br />

I am referring to when I EXP with a friend (a Paladin) and I rarely heal (with the dual box cleric) due to him taking almost no damage.  He certainly takes less damage (on average) than my warrior (by stun locking the mob.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
You say let's be honest and follow that not only by putting words in my mouth, but by trying to display a mentality I have never held or defended. I didn't dismiss the melee changes, I have advocated the need for the provoke line since day 1 and have only stated that the -1DI change had nothing to do with creating a bigger gap between our classes pre GoD. <br />
<br />
The HP advantage is needed because not all damage in brutal battles is melee. Defensive and the &quot;-1 DI&quot; change is melee damage only. The Warrior brutal battle advantage is intended to be somewhat general with exceptions notable because they are exceptions - Griegg for example.<br />
<br />
So what you are saying is that you MUST have those hp's so that when SoE makes casting raid mobs you would still be the best choice as MT for them no matter what. With that kind of mentality I wonder how much of an insult the 2 or 3 fearing raid mobs in the game that are much more effectively done with a knight tanking affect you.<br />
<br />
Outside of raids, the Warrior survivability advantage still provides preference for Warriors when a party hunts high DI mobs.<br />
<br />
And that is plainly wrong. Just like it would be wrong to have whole xp zones where the mobs were all casters with low melee dps/high magic dps with a low resistance to stuns. <br />
<br />
A Paladin's advantages provides preference when the party's main healer is a Druid or Shaman, when multiple adds are frequent and must be controlled, etc.<br />
<br />
That's BS and you know it. Name me exactly how many xp zones there are where a warrior CANNOT MT because his only healer is a druid or shaman but a paladin can under the same circumstances. Also, I never asked for advantages I asked for equality in xp groups.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm pretty defensive about Warrior preference vs. brutal mobs. But I am convinced Knights should have a &quot;burst mitigation&quot; ability totally separate from the ability to successfully MT in the trials as they currently are implimented. I would prefer it if it could be accomplished with Paladin heals and stuns and SK lifetaps since I think this is much more in class character. But I can understand either approach.  Just not comparable to a Warrior's Defensive discipline. <br />
<br />
Once again I state that I have never asked for defensive. It's ironic that you're saying you're not against some form of upgrade/change yet at every turn that something has been mentionned (forego the /def) you've balked and backtracked. <br />
<br />
<br />
I doubt that I can answer your questions or address your reservations to your satisfaction. I don't believe that this is because my explanations are inconsistant with the way things are and what Verant/SoE has said - it's because you don't like the answers and what they mean.<br />
<br />
BB, have you ever considered that paladins are only now asking for this change? If we REALLY wanted your role on raids why exactly did we wait hmmmm 5 expansions?

The concept of the trials to avoid having to backflag people day in and day out is a good one, making it that the gains in those trials are of a very high nature then restricting the access solely to specific classes is not.<br />

I mentionned something on PoN which unfortunately you are unable to read but I'd be interested to know how you feel about this. Part of the outrage from the higher tier players at the arguments going on now is that they believe that players of a lower rank want what they have by skipping content. Why not have GoD trials attached to PoP tiers. <br />
<br />
(Example only not specifics)<br />
<br />
Tier 1 GoD - Open to all<br />
Tier 2 GoD - Open to players having completed tier 1 in PoP<br />
Tier 3-4 GoD - Must be EP enabled<br />
Tier 5+ - Must be PoTime enabled<br />
etc<br />
<br />
Then you have SoE tune the trials/xp zone/raid zones per level. <br />

I am referring to when I EXP with a friend (a Paladin) and I rarely heal (with the dual box cleric) due to him taking almost no damage. He certainly takes less damage (on average) than my warrior (by stun locking the mob.)<br />
<br />
I'm not trying to be insulting but mind telling me at what lvl you're doing this? I can honestly tell you that in EP gear I can't sustain heal myself in an xp setting. (xp setting = EP. LDoN)</div></div><hr />

No way! my spellbbok is worthless! Thats what all Paladins will decry! Its BS, we know it!<br />
<br />
I do NOT agree with all plate classes getting -1 DI and warrior to -2 DI, I would agree KNIGHTS -1DI and Warriors -2 DI! The non-tank classes tank entirely too well, and I think Warriors AND Knights can agree there!</div></div><hr />

BB, have you ever considered that paladins are only now asking for this change? If we REALLY wanted your role on raids why exactly did we wait hmmmm 5 expansions? We didn't ask for the role in PoP, we didn't ask for the role when you got the phase 1 melee changes. What we DID do was start having reservations when the dmg mit change occured in prepartion to GoD. Where we really got vocal was seeing the disperity in the tanking abilities of war/knights in a 1 group setting. Be they trials or not. be they needed by all or not. The concept of the trials to avoid having to backflag people day in and day out is a good one, making it that the gains in those trials are of a very high nature then restricting the access solely to specific classes is not. <br />
You didn't ask for it in PoP because you didn't need to; you already had it.<br />
<br />
Again, and listen very carefully, these trials do not have &quot;WARRIOR ONLY&quot; stamped on them.  All I'm seeing in these posts are paladins whinning that they can't do it.  Which is far from true.<br />
<br />
The problem you seem to be having is that warriors are preferred for tanking... well, duh?  That's what we do?  It's our singular task in the game.  If we weren't prefered for the only role we have, what's the point in having a warrior at all?</div></div><hr />

You read what I believe are the answers and as I predicted you didn't like them.<br />
<br />
It doesn't matter if the &quot;-1 DI&quot; change was needed for X or Y. It's enough that the Warrior Class Description calls for unmatched survivability, the HP gap was patheticly small, and SoE made the change and stated it was &quot;needed&quot;. All done, case closed.<br />
<br />
It doesn't matter if you think Warriors were entitled to more HP's than Paladins. The answers still remain the answers. Warriors are Warriors and Paladins are Paladins.<br />

*The GoD controversy started with claims that Paladins could not perform their group role in GoD trials - debunked<br />
*Then it was claimed they could not get flagged in trials with named mobs that hit for up to 2100HPs - debunked<br />
*Then it was discovered a guild raid would give you the flags for the first 4 trials and that most single group trials didn't look to be mandatory to raid.<br />
<br />
The longer this has gone on, the more some Paladins are forced to admit &quot;the problem&quot; was not as they described it. Now we are down to &quot;We can't do these things with the same reliability.&quot;<br />
<br />
But regardless of which symtoms they report in their nearly daily trip to the doctor's office, the perscription they urge him to write is always the same - Warriors with Spellbooks.<br />
<br />
Yes, Warriors were always supposed to have adequate taunt and in fact have been the primary tank for years.<br />
Though the Paladin and SK will never equal the warrior in their ability to taunt...some of the taunting spells should help them become more effective tanks. - The EverQuest Team <br />
Warriors will still have a significantly larger amount of hit points.<br />

That's BS and you know it. The ONLY time paladins took over the role of MT on raids pre GoD was once that paladin was in the best current expansion gear. We didn't ask to be able to tank EP named/Gods or PoTime Gods upon first entering the zones. We had our secondary roles and played them and were happy with them. <br />

<br />
Why were warriors completely ignored in LDoN pre provoke? Consider the time requirements for a warrior to achieve aggro on a mob back then and then look at that little timer ticking down. You COULD do the dungeons, nothing prevented you, but you just so royally SUCKED at it that nobody bothered inviting you. See a pattern?<br />

Oh yeah cause SoE doesn't screw the pooch every time they have a friggin idea of how to FIX things. Saying a change needs to be done and making a change that borders on the insanely unbalancing are 2 different things. In this case it wasn't the change per say, it was the change in combination with the expansion it was geared on. <br />

Every complaint from warriors pre phase 1 changes were debunked so this is not an argument. Or is it acceptable for paladins to have 1% of their population capable of doing stuff while 99% cannot but the reverse isn't true for warriors.<br />

Lies. Every complaint from warriors pre-phase 1 changes were debunked? I guarantee you the ONLY people who think that are the 20 or so hidebound reactionaries on WoN, sitting around in their paladin pity party circle jerk. There was unanimity across EQ about warrior troubles like there hasn't been about ANY issue I've seen -- confirmed by strong changes implemented by the game designers.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, the line of classes having trouble in GoD trials doesn't start with paladins -- it starts with shaman.<br />

The debunk statement is in regards to warriors COMPLETING LDoN dungeons pre phase 1 changes. Doesn't mean you didn't need to be FIXED, it means BB using the mentality that paladins are FINE in GoD because 1% of the paladin population is capable of doing things is as valid an argument as saying things were fine in LDoN because 1% of warriors pre phase 1 changes were able to complete dungeons.<br />
<br />
As for other classes having trouble in GoD, I don't play those other classes, therefore I obviously cannot argue for them. The debate right now in this thread is also war/pal not druid/cle or chanter/shm etc. <br />

When I play cleric with a pally guildie of mine, I rarely have to heal him, between his stuns and healing himself. In fact there were specific comments made by other members to the effect of he doesn't require much healing. <br />

You don't have to stun lock a mob, to not require much healing by others.</div></div><hr />

Ah, ok, so if there's a 1 group situation, Paladins are supposed to be as good at tanking as warriors... but don't lose their spellbook...  So, you're saying, if it's a 1 group situation, you might as well delete your warrior?  Where the hell did you get the idea that the tanking desirability between Paladins and Warriors is supposed to be the same for single group stuff?<br />
<br />
I don't know about other warriors, but I wasn't ignored in LDoN.  I've never had a problem getting groups for anything, because I know my class and know how to play the game.  The only people I see having problems getting single group invites is because THEY suck, not their class.<br />
<br />
Warriors are SUPPOSED to be umatched in tanking; raid situations AND single groups.  If a group wants more than just a pure tank, they ask a knight to come.  I still have yet to see anyone challange that warriors are supposed to be the best pure tank, in EVERY situation (which isn't even always true), and unless that changes, any other arguements about &quot;tanking balance&quot; are moot.</div></div><hr />

 Hate to disagree with a fellow Warrior, but you're wrong.

I have ZERO problems holding aggro now, I would rather ALL the tanks had a harder job of it, non-tank classes couldn't MT in PoP or LDoN, and overall the game made HARDER. But I knew it would never be allowed that the pet classes of SOE employees be nerfed anyway.</div></div><hr />

One Paladin would regularly include me in his groups - it did not go unnoticed.<br />

I endured hearing people saying thoughtless things like &quot;No, get the Paladin.&quot;, &quot;There are only three Warriors on this server I trust to MT for me.&quot;, and &quot;The Paladin/SK (in pre-EP bazaar gear) will MT, you (near full-EP gear at the time) can backup tank.

I dou'd mushrooms in Fungus grove when Shaman took pity on me (they could solo for more experiance - they didn't need me).<br />

I was so desperate for exp I learned to solo Fear kite. J-stick to reduce resists, Silken Whip of Ensnaring, Polished Obsidean Great Axe. I did most of my first 70 AA points solo.<br />

Warriors argued with their guilds that there were always wothwhile raid targets and the guild should always be raiding (raid exp was often the only exp we got.)<br />

I doubt there's more than a handful of warriors per guild that actually know &quot;how to play their class&quot;.  There's a hundred little tips and tricks you can use to squeeze that last little bit of aggro out or to survive that extra second.  Sure, before I got my Time gear the enchanter might die once during the adventure, or the beastlord will take a pounding for a few seconds right after they slow.  But I never had issues getting into a Hard Guk adventure, even ones without CC (those are quite fun, and having a paladin along to tank mez and group heal is very handy).  But if you were consistantly getting passed over like that, you're doing something wrong.<br />
<br />
I can see getting picked over by a specific other individual of another class, but if you're always getting picked over for another class, no matter who they are...  Learn to use what you have.  Incite was a nice thing to get, and it makes things easier, but I didn't need it to start getting exp groups again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 Had nothing to do with 'what I was doing wrong', had everything to do with the fact that pickup Clerics and Enchanters and Shamans and Wizards and Mages knew that aggro on demand &gt; aggro on RNG. They knew with a Knight they were getting pulling ability, snap aggro, ranged aggro, and the ability to slow on incoming with impunity - Gods know they told me and everyone else that enough. Even though they probably can't explain Incite to you, they know SOMETHING got fixed with the melee upgrade and that mobs are a LOT less likely to peel anymore, so Warriors are back to being 'OK' to group with, although some STILL hold out for Knights.</div></div><hr />

Enchanters do not like to die - not even once.<br />

I've gone from enchanters saying they will leave if a Warrior (not me, any Warrior) is invited into the group to enchanters asking if they should nuke and Clerics meleeing because they have absolutely nothing to do.<br />
