<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tsaotsao</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">We went into Time last night. This was after the 5/26 patch.<br />
<br />
Tiers 1,2 and 3 were as they usually are. No issues noted.<br />
<br />
We attempted TZ in Tier 4 and if he touches a wall, he then becomes untargettable. The only thing that could hit him were pets. Neither Melee attacks, Range attacks, or Spells would land on him. <br />
<br />
So if your instance is coming up, be aware that there may be some problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aramelus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yep, that about sums it up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Danathor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It's not just Time, it's everywhere.  Walls and corners are fucked up, we pushed Devoin M`sha in Qvic through the wall and she suicided on us last night.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Urgot_the_ogre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Had the same problem with Saryrn in teir 4. She sunk into the wall with ease and suck me outside the world with her.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Choppin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">haha, you were lucky you got to phase 4 AT ALL. when we were pulling AoE and SG at end of p3, they.... DISAPPEARED! into p4 somehow... and we had managed to finish the fucking phase with 50 people even with the mass LD's at the end and having to patch a 10 mb file after we could get back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I was in an LDON hard last night and saw the same thing. <br />
The mob touched the wall and became untargetable. Eventually the damn thing gated to its spawn point, then came back with all its rowdy friends. <br />
Whee. Just farkin' whee.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grendonbb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">We got frickin vine boss stuck in wall for ages... almost whiped out our raid on frickin VINE ring in PoE cuz of this shite; mobs that hit you but that you can't hit back... go SOE.<br />
<br />
What makes it even better is, if you get summoned into the wall with them, you can't move at all.  No turning, no ducking, nothing at all.  /rewind didn't even work to get me out.  In conclusion?  Walls are bugged, /rewind doesn't work, and all of the encounters that require/encourage walling mobs jus got a bit tougher.  Lets hope it doesn't take as long to fix this problem as it did the warrior multiple incite thing, cuz otherwise we may have to deal with this for months.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>xabel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">TT Saryrn bugged for us had to fight in the open, I fear TZ,VZ and quarm are gonna suck hardcore<br />
<br />
might have to use unshrunk ogre illusion on MT again liek a few patch ago<br />
<br />
anyway SoE programmers are really worthless :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Niafix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">TT Saryrn bugged for us had to fight in the open, I fear TZ,VZ and quarm are gonna suck hardcore<br />

<br />

<br />
The Ogre illusion thing was only so you didn't have to press forward when tanking.  With this patch, the monster will go over your head and get stuck in the wall, then summon you outside of geometry, then wipe your raid.  Just avoid walls and corners altogether.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Hinanek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">We managed to corner tank TZ, but we had to use ALOT of counter push from pallies and nukers to keep him from falling into the wall</div></div><hr />

<br />
We killed everything in time by walking the mob.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The M'shas have always poofed if they warp through walls buggily. It's not just because of the latest patch, for those specifically, it's a pre-existing problem</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sikkorak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Went back and did the RZ script in Potac for backflagging.  That script is mostly useless now.  Frustration got the best of us and we just said forget it for the night.  Heard of others with many PoP Tier 1/2/3 stuff too.<br />
<br />
Nice work SoE, that's all I say.  I hope they fix this, the straw that broke the camel's back is just around the corner for me at this rate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">yeah it sucks. but not impossible. just have to keep em boxed away from walls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Dalrek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Experienced the same problem with trash mobs in Inktuta. If you get them in the wall somehow, then you cant hit or nuke it until you get it back out  :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Tachyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Managed to get TZ down to 0% health and then went into wall and warped back to spawn...  :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Sshaithis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Same problem. Got saryn okay, and tz was rough but we made it through, VZ is just horrible trying to keep the mob on top of the MT out in the open... trying again now, will post results soonish...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>XAclylospradaX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">A few months ago there was a collision problem that made tier 4+ suck ass, esp VZ who would warp back to spawn with 100% everytime he hit a wall.  We dealt with that for 3 hours before we won it.<br />
<br />
This time around we worked a few things differently and didn't run into one problem. Actually tonights kill was cleaner than kills w/o buggs. IMO these random fuck ups soe does just makes clearing time more fun. ^_~<br />
<br />
We stayed away from walls as much as possible and just adjusted ourselfs to the encounter so things wouldn't get walls and such. Quarm fight was the longest ever, as our normal tact wasn't doable.<br />
<br />
Only thing that sucks is guilds that have to deal with this shit for the first time being in tier 3+.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Stormbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Got everything but RZ, Inny and Quarm. Has anyone had any luck on RZ since the patch?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>goobayouface</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">we did rz near the corner we normally do him, but w/ him being basically &quot;pinned&quot; at the corner of the steps, while the adds people were on opposite side of the room<br />
worked really well, if he got moved wrong i could make him summon me and it would usually fix his position<br />
was surprising that people didn't get raped on ae ramp ;p<br />
inny and quarm were a bit tougher because we basically had to fight them totally different</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>XAclylospradaX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">We did rz the same way, towards the end it got a little wierd and he ended up little close to the clerics but we did win.<br />
<br />
Inny could of been worse but didn't, someone did agro CT but seemingly moved  him the other way. ^_~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Hinanek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">IMO these random fuck ups soe does just makes clearing time more fun. ^_~<br />

<br />
<br />
Not if you've never killed VZ before o.o</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>aguktawarrior</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">We managed to clear p4 on our friday, was.... interesting not being able to use walls and corners. We go back to time today and hopefully our strat for no walls help us finish our loot farming as we are still very new to time (killed Quarm for our first time last Sunday).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Niafix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Got everything but RZ, Inny and Quarm. Has anyone had any luck on RZ since the patch?<br />
<br />
Yeah, we killed rz differently than normal. We did Inny and Quarm in a very similar manner to our normal strategy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Haven't killed anything that needed a corner since the night after last patch, have they fixed it? (I saw an new DX DLL get patched since).<br />
<br />
If not can anyone provide a link to discussion about this on Sony's boards?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Kilzalot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Wasn't fixed as of lsat night.  Have heard it's fixed on Test though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Thunndarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">the really fun part is when you get adds from tier 5 in tier 4</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Niafix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">the really fun part is when you get adds from tier 5 in tier 4<br />
<br />
Yeah that happened to us 2 weeks or so ago after we killed Terris (last p4 mob).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">found an answer to my own question - look here (http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=development&amp;message.id=1171&amp;no_redir=true) if interested.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Hinanek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Are Phase 4 and Phase 5 right next to eachother in the world?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Sardaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Are Phase 4 and Phase 5 right next to eachother in the world? <br />
<br />
<br />
they're on top of each other like pancakes<br />
<br />
do a /loc next time your in phase 4, then when your in phase 5, you'll be able to walk to those same x,y coords, but your z axis will be differnt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Frax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Wasn't fixed as of lsat night.  Have heard it's fixed on Test though.<br />
<br />
<br />
phase/tier 5 doesn't spawn until phase/tier 4 is cleared..  i have personally been warped into phase 5 twice due to wall bugs and there were no mobs there at all.  Well except the time VZ warped up there with me and chased me around until he warped home :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Aonodorus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">supposedly fixed with this mornings patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Kilzalot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">supposedly fixed with this mornings patch.<br />
<br />
Can anyone confirm?  Didn't seem to have any problems in Uqua, what about PoTime?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Phal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Saryrn didnt get stuck in a wall last night, she did fall under world though. For a minute or 2 we had a target ring running about killing people and no Saryrn, after killing some healers she popped back. Think the tank fell to tier 5 also, dont quote me on this but he did have to be rezzed in GY.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Detheb Ultimaweapon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Dunno about PoP, but Velious doesn't seem to be working.<br />
<br />
Did Vindi to get to Statue, had him walled for maybe 45seconds, then he went into wall, and luckily pets managed to kill him.<br />
DId Statue/Idol w/o Cornering.<br />
AoW fell into wall at 4% or so, (with tank). Tank died cause noone could heal etc. Seems that it only happens when mob is walled/cornered for a long period of time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Urgot_the_ogre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Time TZ went into wall. Not more than we where able to pull him out again but i still wouldent call the problem fixed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Mobs getting in to walls is not as bad as it was, but it's still not fixed. Best bet is to not wall mobs for now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>landrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Sarryn - Awesome, raid could not push over top<br />
VZ, TZ - would get pushed into corner then po back about 10 feet.<br />
<br />
Cazic Thule Never entered wall, did like going into that lil cage a lot though.<br />
BErt - Could not push more than 30 feet from corner, very good position.<br />
Rallos Zek- Pets would continuously push into wal, could not hit/cast, could be pulled out. walling made fight last 21 minutes..<br />
<br />
Inny - esy to position, collisions fixxed, but his leash and add leash are HUGE now<br />
<br />
this as of 6/3</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Hinanek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">TT and Saryrn both warped to spawn point, and MT fell to Tier 5 each time they were up against a wall for more than maybe 30 seconds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Brudal the Fat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Before last patch Vallon stopped us dead in our tracks in phase4. That was on 6/1 so we knew the patch was going in the next day and just called it. The following day he and phase5 and Quarm went down same as always.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Kleth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">As of 5th of June.<br />
<br />
P4:<br />
1: TZ/VZ get stuck and out of melee dmg(procs worked though?) if pinned on bookcase, used pallys and monks to fix it, not really that bad.<br />
2: Saryrn walled pinned with no problems with her.<br />
3: TT wouldnt go to corner sorta ghosted and stayed in 1 spot, not a load of problems /shrug<br />
<br />
P5: Only attempted rallos tonight, he can go into corner/wall, but not by much or he tethers to spawn point, managed to do that twice and wiped at 5 % =/<br />
Second time used monks and pally to keep him just out of corner, worked well but had too few people to wrap it up.<br />
<br />
I'm guessing rest of P5 is like this, it's by no means impossible, just means you have to counter raid push and pinning. Still I wouldnt call this a fix.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Nayl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">We had exactly the same deal as Phal with Saryrn, she went into the wall, tank fell to tier 5, she killed several of us from underneath, then popped back to our level.  <br />
<br />
TT started out ok, then became untargetable, we pulled her out of the wall and kept her there.  <br />
<br />
TZ we avoided fully cornering, and we never wall or corner VZ.<br />
<br />
By this time we were leary of walling anything, so we killed CT, Bert, RZ and Inny without cornering or walling.<br />
<br />
Quarm we stuffed into his usual cubbyhole, had no issues.<br />
<br />
Whatever they did was, as usual, about a half good solution.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Dubb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">06/05 - Terris was going pretty normal, went into wall once but pulled her out, no big deal. Then at ~12%, she suddenly vanished and summoned MT to p5, then stayed there for about 5 minutes. All we could do was sit there, keep healing (MT was still in heal range while in p5), waiting for something to happen. She'd regenned about 2% (while going 1-on-1 with MT in p5) before she warped back to her platform so we could finally kill her. She rampaged me in p4 without any problems for the duration.  Was... interesting, I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>aguktawarrior</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Only had an issue with Saryrn in time thus far, she went into the wall a little bit summoned me through the world then got pulled out and no issues. I ran back and rejoined the fight once i got sent to gy.</div></div><hr />
