<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kazzuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nope, removing an aug destroys it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Wrong. Once you augment an item, the only options are to remove the augment and lose it, or keep it in the item. They are not reusable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Alisdahre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I can understand that for the droppable augs, but damn.... when you spend 1150 on an aug, there is no way they should have implemented it like this.<br />
<br />
Been playing this game since release day... I've had minor annoyances with some of the things they've implemented or changed...  but this is the first &quot;feature&quot; SOE has added that truly pisses me off to no end.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Raunstonecutter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It makes you really think about what you're doing to your equipement.  Like the +6 stat augs?  Who cares?  But for like Anger3 or the 40hp augs, you really have to pay attention to where you're putting them.  Like I put anger2 on my BoC when I got the points to.  I don't regret it, even though I know that I'll have to strip it off and give back my BoC when I get an upgrade for it.<br />
<br />
Last week I was in a raid killing the key guys for the Smith raid (or something in that zone!), and I recieved a 15 ac aug.  The question for me was &quot;where do I put it?&quot;  I thought about it for a while, and figured I'd put it somewhere that was good on my hps (ornate legs), and that I wouldn't be upgrading in the near future to get the most use out of it.  Its just like with the 40 hp, V3, Regen Augs.  I wouldn't put a good one on my valorium ring of galantry, or my SS gaunts (yes ghetto!), but I'd put the 40hp one on my BP in a heartbeat.<br />
<br />
You really have to figure out what you will get the most value for your points invested.  Putting anger 3 on a Windblade?  Not worth it to me, but Anger3 on a GSoT, much more worth it.  You can use a GSoT for a LONG time, and adding Anger3 to it will only make it that much better.  The windblade, because of its price, lack of hps, and lack of an origional taunt proc, is not a good of value for the augment.<br />
<br />
I personally like the system.  You get rewarded for your work, but its up to you to get the most value out of the reward<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I also dislike the system of destroying augments.  For the majority of us, it's weeks or months of playing to save up for an anger 3 aug.  Then when we get a weapon upgrade all that time and effort is lost except for the time we got to use it.  I suppose it is the same for no drop quested gear, but augments are just just... different.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Keane Abrams</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I have bought Anger 3, 3 times now and I fully expect to buy it the next time I upgrade my aggro weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Thyll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It would be nice if we got the augment back when we removed it, it would make things so much easier. Especially when the good ones take such a long time to get and are lore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">an option to destroy the item but not the aug would be nice to have too.</div></div><hr />

an option to destroy the item but not the aug would be nice to have too.  <br />
<br />
I agree... I think you should get the option to trash the item instead of the aug because if you are upgrading, the aug is prolly worth a lot more to you then the item anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Rolam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Just a different viewpoint here...my main char is an Enchanter, but my secondary char over the past 4 years has been a warrior.  <br />
<br />
My point being that, I believe that a viable option for taking augments off of items, would involve master tradesmen...i.e. you want to get an augment taken off a piece of armor, you go see a smith/tailor, want to get an augment taken off a piece of jewelry, go see a jeweler and so forth.<br />
<br />
The problem being, that augmented pieces are no drop, and that you couldn't hand the item to the tradesman to do a combine to take it off.<br />
<br />
This wouldn't be too hard to figure a work around though.<br />
<br />
The combine could have a percentage of returning both the aug and item, and a percentage of returning the aug itself and destroying the item or vice versa.<br />
<br />
You know tradeskills, there's always got to be that chance that you loose your bank account...or in this case, an expensive item.<br />
<br />
Either way, I think this is a sound idea.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">anyone ever notice that when you put a very expensive aug onto one of your best items THAT is the time you win that rare drop to upgrade same item?<br />
<br />
i agree you really have to pay attention to what you augment when its an expensive aug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Binnamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I think an aug should be limited to being on only 2 items. So, you take it off your current item and can put it back on another BUT once you take it out of that item it is destroyed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
maybe just make sure it's an item you'll use for a long time if not then don't waste it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Bluenet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Yes this thread interests me.  Im not sure if I want to anger my GSoT since I will upgrade it shortly.  Guess Ill have to see how aggro goes.</div></div><hr />
