<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kenneys Bounces</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">We all know class balancing is a very sensitive issue. However, most warrior complaints (the majority of casual players) come from a very simple thing : <br />
<br />
1) Enemy (600 hitting mobs) approaches. Shaman/chanter slows. Mob goes crazy on them. Needs several taunts (sometimes) to taunt it off. (this results in random deaths of course)<br />
<br />
I can suggest a VERY simple fix. Make taunt work 100% of the time on the first push of the button when a mob is above 80% of it's health. (not referring to boss mobs)<br />
<br />
Following this absor, you can then take your time and fix the remaining issues.<br />
<br />
<br />
Long term fixes :<br />
<br />
Reitemization<br />
-Warrior hp needs to have a significant advantange in terms of percentage over a hybrid at ALL levels. A 1000 hp advantage when a warrior is 11 k, and a hybrid is 10 k isn't acceptable. It needs to be a percentage.<br />
A 1000 hp advantage when a warrior is 4 k, and a hybrid is 3 k is acceptable. This trend(during lvls 50s to 60s) should follow as a fixed percentage throughout to the end game. (where a hybrid would have 9 k, and a warrior would have 12 k in full time gear is acceptable)<br />
<br />
- Disciplines need to be unlocked from each other (timing purposes) for ALL melee classes. <br />
<br />
-Warriors, paladins, sks should all be considered equal tanks for group exp situations. (first come first serve basis) <br />
<br />
The same principle from DPS classes should apply here. (where if you want a dps class, you'll pick any rogue, wizard, mage, or necro that comes first)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Technically Enraging/taunting Blow hate procs etc are the (three year old) Temporary fix whilst they sort out taunt and aggro :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>aakla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I dont think taunt should work 100% of the time. this would trivialize parts of the game. it should add a set amount of agro instead of just moving you to the top of the list.<br />
<br />
or make mobs have undead agro for the first 5% of the fight then witch to live agro. this way we could control the start of the fight then yuo have to know what your doing from 95% to dead. or something like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Taunt works perfectly now,<br />
yes it does, seriously.<br />
<br />
It's not suppose to give us aggro, the best situation that describes Taunt's usage, is when the Main Tank dies.... the secondary tank can get aggro immediately.<br />
It's a &quot;save the day&quot; button... or thats what it should be.<br />
<br />
If they turn it into an aggro button... then forgot playing warrior....<br />
it'll all become about clicking the Taunt button as fast as possible?<br />
No thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>OlavSkulcrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I agree with Bunnie. We want real fixes, not band aids. Valeris is also correct, that hate procs were supposed to be a band aid. In Velious<br />
<br />
I've said it before, that aggro is the achilles heal of the EQ combat AI. So much of a group or raids tactics are made or broken by aggro control. Thus, classes that can control aggro &gt;&gt; classes that cannot. If a wizard actually has to watch his aggro, he'll put out substantially lower dps. If the shaman or enchanter has to wait for aggro to build before slowing, the cleric has to stick the tank with fast heals to keep him up, potentially adding med time, not to mention potential aggro on him. So, if you stick any tank class that has near perfect aggro lock in front of a mob, the game's AI is essentially taken out of the equation and the game is dumbed down in the extreme. Only pulling is really relevent then.<br />
<br />
The taunt skill works pretty much exactly as intended. Whether that is good enough is certainly debatable. What isn't working as intended is the combination that exists now. Knights' tanking abilities being so nearly equal to a warrior's in exp groups, and their aggro abilities being near perfect lock.<br />
<br />
Because of this, I think it would probably be better for the game to nerf knights' aggro and boost warrior's aggro up to the point where they just about meet in the middle. But I also think that SOE is about 0.0001% likely to do that right if they try (that is equalize the balance instead of just reverting another class to suckage). So, I suppose the only real solution is to boost warrior's aggro to just a bit under knight aggro. <br />
<br />
And this has to be done WITHOUT band-aids such as hate procs. Personally, I hate even the idea of hate procs. (pun intended) Using itemization to keep one class where it is supposed to be relative to similar classes isn't inherently bad, but it should be something systematic, rather than something slapped onto random items. The higher AC and HPs of WAR only armor in the old days (crafted and Indo, for example) is an example of doing it reasonably well. Telling warriors, 'Hey, you'll get the advantages of your specific class, but only when you get this or that item,' isn't acceptable.<br />
<br />
Specific items should enhance your ability to do your job, not make it possible.  A whole set of WAR only items across whole zones and levels of the game that have some built in advantage for warriors (more AC/more HPs than equivalent armor available to other plate classes) isn't the best way to do it, IMO, but it is at least acceptable.<br />
<br />
In summary, I think that anything they come up with that is a half-way decent solution is still a ways off. We probably won't even hear about it until it hits the test server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Deadalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If a wizard actually has to watch his aggro, he'll put out substantially lower dps <br />
<br />
That's true. I play my (lvl 55) wizzie in ldon mainly, and when grouped with a pally I can sometimes pull agro from him if I try, but more often then not the mob dies first cause i have to crank my dps up so much. So, 99% of the time, I shove loads of fiery death up a mob's arse happily and safely, with not a care in the world.<br />
<br />
With a warrior, on the other hand, I don't even bother getting KEI. For the piddly amount of nukes I can safely throw with a warrior tank in ldon - about half of what I can with a knight - spending pp on KEI would be wasting it. <br />
<br />
Now, I probably wouldn't care if it weren't for the disparity that exists. If *every* tank had trouble holding agro when I overnuke I'd watch my agro a lot more, do the concussion quest, and accept it as fact of life. But the fact that the disparity exists means there is, sadly, no such thing as &quot;overnuking&quot; anymore and it's 10 times easier to not bother with the concussion quest (which is a royal pain in the arse btw) and just avoid warriors, or nuke a lot less when you get stuck with one.<br />
<br />
Which sucks royally, because when I'm avoiding groups with the class I enjoy playing the MOST, and always have, well - something's out of whack.<br />
<br />
Nerf knight agro, boost warrior agro, do *something* to balance the classes to the point where I can look forward to grouping with a warrior as much as I do to grouping with a knight when playing a DPS class. Heck, so I could look forward to playing my warrior again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Rzal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">How about this. SoE adds a new ability.  We'll call this ability, I dont know, Feint.  we'll make it 50 hate, unresistable, first trainable at level 25.  Refresh time something along the lines of 12 seconds(twice taunt refresh time).  Since its a skill it has a chance to fail, so let's cap it at 200.  <br />
<br />
Having an extra non-random hate producer shouldn't be a game breaker.  If 50 hate every 12 seconds is unreasonable, then hell make it scalable with your skill level.   <br />
<br />
My feeling that just improving taunt won't make the problem go away.  Knights have taunt too, so do rangers.   Improving it will in the end make them even better at holding aggro than us.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This statement struck me as sooo true..<br />
<br />
Ask around to the Wizards you see, you would be amazed at the number, especially new high level wizards, who DONT do the Concussion spell quest, for mainly one reason. They never have needed the spell, because Knights are the defacto base Tank. <br />
<br />
Anything less than aggro-lock is unacceptable by many people these days..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Naubi Fionn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">where a hybrid would have 9 k, and a warrior would have 12 k <br />
<br />
At the moment a paladin can be getting close (a few hundred off) to 9k hp with just luclin gear (admittedly the best piece in each slot). So any recalibration of this kind would invlove a substantial nerf to knights... I don't think anyone would like seeing themselves knocked back an expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Which begs the question, which would you prefer - equalised aggro so you have to work slightly harder (as warriors still do successfully today) for your aggro and be able to tank or have superior aggro but fold like a paper bag?<br />
<br />
disclaimer : YES I do also think that that equalised level should be bumped higher than unassisted warrior taunt today.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kenneys Bounces</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Most of the opinions stated above are permanent long term changes that need research (Lots of months...maybe years).<br />
<br />
My suggestion was very simple. A temporary bandaid which is NOT a long term solution but a solution that will temporarily make average-joe warriors VIABLE in exp groups in the planes. Let the NORMAL-AVERAGE-JOE warrior hold taunt for the first minute or two in the fight so that when slow lands, the warrior is able to take aggro after a single taunt. (where i suggested taunt,for all plate classes, to succeed on the first try when the mob is above 80% hp. This suggestion does NOT apply to boss mobs)<br />
<br />
Just this little fix....will enable many average joe warriors to actually find a group to join in the planes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Naubi Fionn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Problem is it looks like SOE actualyl want paladins to have near warrior hitpoints, or why would they give them a self buff of 350hp that stacks with virtue?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">the only prpblem i see is if they give it to us when they take it away well bitch.</div></div><hr />
