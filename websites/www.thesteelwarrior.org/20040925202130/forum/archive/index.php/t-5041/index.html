<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Esvee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My guild has a dkp system in place, basically allowing you to bid on anything you want. The exception to this are Enraging Blow weapons, which warriors gain priority on.<br />
<br />
Quite honestly this was never an issue as knights allways passed on BoW and wars generally passed on Sews. <br />
<br />
Despite probably being next or second in line for a BoW, I kind of broke this trend recently by looting a Sews; All knights on the raid had it except 2 SK s, one who pops very, very rarely and another who just joined the guild a week ago. None of the knights seemed to mind except one SK who got hysterical claiming he'd apply for a BoW if it dropped to rub my nose in it. (not like the officers would allow that anyway)<br />
<br />
I got an anger 3 aug for the Sews and it seems to work great; I can t compare it to the BoW, but I see little reason to leave Sews's exclusively to knights. Obviousely I would feel it s fair l pass on Blades of War untill most regular raiding warriors have them. <br />
<br />
But I'm kind of wondering how other guilds do this? Do you allways pass on Sews for knights and do knights do the same for Bows? Considering the horrible drop rate on the BoW, I certainly feel a Sews is a great alternative that warriors should have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gurgeh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sews is an alternative to BoW indeed, that said imo it would be a waste to loot a BoW if you have a sews. A waster of dkp / merit for you, a waste of a weapon for your guild, unless you are really flooded with bow / sews.<br />
A knight that want a decent 2hander would be in his right to not pass over a war that has a sews.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lilwee Beasty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">BoW is warrior only in our guild. We awarded the first 3 to our top 3 tanks (have 5 total BoWs now). SEWS is open bid in a DKP system...so far we have 3, all on knights. Warriors tend to throw some DKP at the SEWS, but normally knights save up more and are willing to spend more for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>issu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Acutally I think you should work on Time prograss since KE is a time-enable guild already.<br />
There are a lot of BETTER 2hs for knight in potime and I am sure it should replace SEWS.<br />
It's very pitty that war don't have good enough 2hs in potime.<br />
Btw, for the SK who claims to apply BoW, I suggest just let him be. Normally once it happens, you can see a retire wave of guild member :D :D :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Timmok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well we dont raid PoE or RZ anymore. But we had a rule saying first 3 BoWs to drop would be warrior only, after that anyone could buy. However no knight ever tried to buy it even after the first 3, so that was np.<br />
<br />
SEWS was open to all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Aldarion_Shard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">BoW is War reserved, and goes by rank (i.e. once all &quot;main tank' calibre warrioers have one, 'second tank' warriors may bid, etc.)<br />
<br />
SEWS is knight reserved, cause they felt strongly enough about it.  (Well, technically, once all knights on any given raid have passed on the SEWS it opens up for other bids but that aint gonna happen).<br />
<br />
Pretty dcent system IMO, saves some arguments.  Just wish there were more low-agro dps alternatives available for wars.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gromlok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">For Pak'Cafan the BoW was always merited by the officers.  The SEWS has always been open to all and some of our Warriors took it, mostly because we don't do RZ very much anymore.<br />
<br />
Indeed there are huge upgrades in PoTime for both class types.  Our top Warriors were asked to pick their weapon of choice in PoTime and that weapon has been/will be merited when it drops.<br />
<br />
If there is one thing a guild should not leave to chance its a good agro weapon for all of the main tanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>KaoraEci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">BoW issue was disputed heavily in our guild as we had never &quot;awarded&quot; an item before, however due to the nature of the weapon it was the first time we did, but it was a &quot;set&quot; cost. So the person who was awarded it didn't get a free dkp weapon.<br />
Sews was open to all and almost all of our hybrids have one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>zaos13</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">/whistle<br />
<br />
IIRC(since i recently put myself on the shelf recently) we were trying to get all the active warriors the good agro weapons...<br />
<br />
SEWS BoW VDD or DBtoWL<br />
<br />
if you got one you wouldn't get the other. i stoped in recently on a necro and surlok(who will find this thread soon) had a darkblade and a SEWS and was mentioning that darkblade sucked in comparision to sews w/ anger3... and he was using his old SEWS instead... i think the line was<br />
<br />
I can't believe im using a tier 4 weapon of a time phase 5 class specific weapon...or sometihng to that effect..<br />
<br />
So IMO (with anger 3 in mind) - BoW ,VDD/SEWS, DBotWL if your wanting your end game weapon<br />
<br />
oh yeah keep this in mind, i havn't touched rz in tactics in a long time due to one lesser guild killing him over 60 times straight, so if your in that situation take what you can get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Hinanek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">First 3 BoWs were awarded to our top 3 tanks, then after that we have been bidding on them with dkp/mp's</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">we use dkp. bows went to warriors knights seemed happy to plumb for sews. at the end of the day common sense will should prevail without the need for additioanl rules.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Dima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">we're dkp.<br />
open bidding<br />
BoW is ffa untill certain point range, then it becomes WAR only and others can't bid on it.<br />
SEWS FFA, but most everyone has the respect for knights to get it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Khumak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">We're pure DKP so everything is open to everyone.  We've only seen 1 BoW drop so far and our MT out tiers everyone so it defaulted to him.  We've only seen 2 SEWS and I was sick of my velious weapons so I grabbed one.  The other went to a Pally.  Haven't seen another drop since.  Keep in mind that knights have upgrades available at pretty regular intervals from ToV all the way to time.  Warriors don't.  RZ is pretty low priority for us right now so we probably won't even do him more than a few more times.  It's pretty likely that we won't get another BoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kilaara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">DKP-System.<br />
<br />
BoW = War prefered SEWS-User excluded<br />
SEWS= BoW-User excluded</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Taelen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">We award our loot via officer loot council and our first BoW went to me.  Although some of our SK's were tempted to try and go in on them, it was decided that the BoW's would go to warriors first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Snowz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">We use the &quot;DIBS!&quot; system... it works good for us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Urgot_the_ogre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">My guild use a DKP bidding system. Everyone that can use an item may bid on it. Only exeption are EB weapons that are Warrior only.<br />
<br />
This system works really well most of the time but it have its flaws like most systems.<br />
One of these flaws is that out of the 4 Sews we have gotten 2 of them have ended up in the hands of rangers. Guess whos the next to fall if the MT dies...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Uhh that's one of the best ranger weapons to get pre-time. If they can't manage the agro then your rangers suck ass, sorry. <br />
<br />
For us it will be sews open, bow war restricted. Raid pts bid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Surlok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Ours was bows to wars first,On a particular RZ kill where 2 bows dropped and only one war needing was online,It went to a ranger and he did fine with it.<br />
<br />
Being in time now if we have warriors in need of an aggro weapon they are first in line for VDD.<br />
<br />
I was the first warrior to loot a Sews on Tholuxe.As in I think our last 9 RZ kills leading up to that point no bows dropped and the guild tired of the racing for a mob that dropped things no one watned other than a particualrly rare weapon.<br />
<br />
With Augs now it is a very worthy weapon,I wouldn't say though that it is so good that it should become a warrior exculisve or prefered even weapon.For Rangers and Knights its a great sword...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Barraind</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Pure DKP, goes to whomever spends the most.<br />
<br />
Thats by far the way to go, once you go &quot;dkp but this this and this go to x y and z class&quot; you should stop calling your system dkp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Aielman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I think &quot;pure&quot; dkp sucks for just this reason. Just because soe are asshats when it comes to itemization doesn't mean that you should allow anyone other than a warrior to go in on a BoW until all the warriors that want one, have one. <br />
<br />
Considering the abundance of good 2h weapons for knights at all levels of the game, and the fact that 2 or 3 months after they get a sews they will be bagging it for a GBoC or VDD, there's no point in making SEWS knight only.<br />
<br />
peace,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>bakkal2003</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">We are pure DKP. Our first BOW went to an SK (Much to the horror of many in the guild), the next 8 went to Wars, next to SK, 2 more to Wars for a total of 12 BOW's.<br />
<br />
Some hated the decision to keep it this way, some loved it.  As a guild whole, and as an individual you should know what is best for your class.   If I wanted to decide where loot went, I could do that without a problem and build a perfect raiding army.  Both systems have problems, both have some great benefits.<br />
<br />
Our rule is. &quot;You earned the DKP, spend it however you want&quot;<br />
<br />
The only rules in DKP we have are that you can't buy items for non main characters until all other mains have passed.<br />
<br />
To me, there is no right or wrong in this.  I see both sides of it and KNOW that it's best in the hands of a warrior.  The other big picture side of it is.. &quot;If you start making exceptions for items, you'll have this discussion when FT items drop.. When Fire based nuke enhancers drop. and on down the line.<br />
<br />
We are DKP.  You want it? Bid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Zynth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">my guild, for the most part, is pure DKP. but, we do have our silent agreement on any weapon that drops. common sence should always rule out. our rangers always have first picks on a bow, no one will out bid a rogue on a piercer, or a warrior on an EB weapon, and for the most part, we let our knights get first shot at 2h weapons. we never made a rule about this or forced it on the member base, but you should always think about your guild as a whole.<br />
<br />
to the guy above me, i'm suprised your warriors stayed in a guild that let the first BoW (the warriors holy grail) go to a SK. you should of forced the SK to MT everything just on principal :D until the next BoW dropped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Krassus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">/agree Bakkal<br />
<br />
I run my guild with a DKP like system with Bidding. Our loot couldn’t be any better spread. If you raid you get points then you get loot. If you want something then bid it. I have dumped all my points a few times for BF, BoW, Aten BP, Cloak of thorns back in the day =D, even on BBB when it was best 2her available. If you want something nut up and bid</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Bumamgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">We use officer council to award loot.<br />
<br />
Although we have yet to obtain a BoW, they will be warrior only till all 5 warriors have one.<br />
<br />
Sews will be knight only.<br />
<br />
We award loot for the good of the guild as a whole, and keep in mind the &quot;loot picture&quot; based on what drops off of current and &quot;forseeable future&quot; targets.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are 5 solid upgrades from upper end luclin stuff to time in terms of knight 2handers. 1 is knight only, 1 is all melee, 1 is warrior + knight, 2 are warrior, knight, ranger<br />
<br />
Just because there are more 2handers with knight on them as opposed to warrior, doesnt mean they are &quot;upgrades&quot; to anything but themselves.  Warriors and other melee see the same thing in 1h's...<br />
<br />
Knights will upgrade bow/sews/earthstaff to vdd/gboc... but warriors will up bow/sews/earthstaff to a vdd or dbow and or eoe and or ed (why do people love a bad weapon with a straight dd proc?) + something decent when they get the chance as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Ellisand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">We use pure dkp (no restrictions)<br />
<br />
:P and bakkal sucks cause he posted here first</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Tarkas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">We dictated first 4. Pure DKP is a poor solution for gearing MT's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Jaqyl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">My guild uses an officer loot council.  So far we've had one BoW drop in three RZ kills(online numbers dropped dramatically after the initial RZ flagging push).  The BoW went to our MT(not me).  Since entering the EPs we've had 9-10 SEWS drops(our first three runs at the ring produced two SEWS drops each) and they have gone about an even mix of knights and warriors.  <br />
<br />
I on the other hand am still wielding BF/BoC, when I put in for a SEWS I was told I was ineligible due to being guaranteed the next BoW drop as I am the Secondary Tank.  Thats a mixed bag for me since I have my concerns about us doing RZ again/enough to produce another BoW . . . seeing as our first RZ kill was October the 21st, and we had two subsiquent kills in the two weeks following . . . and none since.  We've attempted him twice within the last month, the first being a disaster, and the second, last night, failing at 9% due to a lack of dps causing the fight to go longer and us losing control of the adds.<br />
<br />
Given my situation should I push for the SEWS or just wait it out?  I'm still kinda unclear, given anger3 augs, which weapon is superior, or if there is enough of a difference to make one or the other more desireable.  I've read the entire &quot;SEWS vs BoW&quot; thread and only come away with the conclusion that people like what they have, whether it be a SEWS or a BoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Ellisand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Pure DKP is a poor solution for gearing MT's. <br />
<br />
<br />
 personally I agree, that said all warrior in guild now have a bow, we have 14 I think<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
 I'd wait for a Bow Jaq your weapons atm arn't at all bad while your waiting for the bow to drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Khumak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Gearing up your MT to the exclusion of the rest of the guild also runs you the risk of taking a massive setback if your MT leaves the guild for some reason.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Tarkas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Which is why we did 4.<br />
<br />
In most cases its just not feasible for an MT to keep up gearwise under pure DKP if you want to advance quickly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Ellisand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">aye aslo that if mt drops due to fizzle or ld or something your other tanks arn't going to hold water etc, personally i'd see tanks preference in everything but hey i'm biased ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
 in seriousness though (:P and bakkals prolly laughing his ass off at me saying this) he was right to gear 'the guild' up rather then focus on particular classes (aka warriors) he pointed out we don't have any tanks nor have had any with 100% attendence, healing errors, lds, etc etc, and many of the tanks have 'geared' up together from 8000ish hp to 10k+ tanks get on well together, no jealosies etc (give one tank everything and there likly will be) /shrugs I think it worked out better in the long term this way</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Had a warrior priority on bow, they abused this by a rotation, end of story. FFA now</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Krassus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">we rewarded EP armor all but BP cause were not in time to top 2 MTs and just farmed the piss out of bow's =x  now Mr. MT2 who is 16 is AFK and whipped up</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Dinekus Aleswig</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">We use a loot/attendance ratio type system.  However our BoW's are all awarded to warriors only at this point by myself and the other officers present.  We have only gotten 5 out of too many RZ kills, one quit the game, the other 4 still play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Zaboo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">We use a bidding DKP system with 1 restriction -- Enraging Blow weps go to warriors first.  SEWS are open to all.  We have 3 BoWs on warriors and 1 SEWS on a knight.<br />
<br />
On a side note, DKP was never intended to be &quot;pure&quot;.  The concept was invented by Afterlife and their system, which is the most mature DKP around, does have preferences for items.<br />
<br />
EverQuest is supposed to be fun.  More people have fun when a warrior gets a BoW and knights get SEWS.  If you are pure DKP on every item, the game turns into a job of farming content for your loot distro system.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">same as zaboo here; but ours is closed DKP bidding, warriors exclusive, and no warriors are to bid on SEWS.<br />
we had a pecking order tho with the warirors of the guild and we would bank the DKP needed in order to pay fair amounts ( high min bid too ).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Dracillion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">We're open DKP with some limitations.  BoWs are actually merit, with a DKP deduction.
