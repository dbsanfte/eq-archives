Taking resellers out of the equation and guaranteeing security is not a bad thing if u assume (and you should) that it is going to happen anyways. Frankly I wish they would do this and drop the anal policies on accounts and use the proceeds to fund programmers and GMs. If they did that no one should bitch.<br />
<br />
I would love to see how many fewer active accounts there would be if people didnt flout theritheir policies. Should be easy, see how many have had a name change (RL not character) and subtract those who are female RL and kept same city after change (married but didnt move).<br />
<br />
And my 6 accounts voted yes if u are wondering. I think its important for the health of the game in next 2 years to remove impediments to people wanting to play. I am here till this game dies ;)<br />
