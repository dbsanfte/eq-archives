<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Warriorman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am twinking a warrior and planning on getting him 65 as an alt.  I have a good amount of plat still and wondering what are some good weapons combos for the first pre-req levels and for weapons later on?  Also, SoD on my server is around 200k and BoC is 300-400k is BoC so much better then SoD to be worth paying 200k more?  Weapons I have been thinking of for first 50 levels are SoD, Sboz, Horn of hsagra and offhanders Blackened Acrylia blade.  For later on I still thinking of SoD, BoC, Copper hammer, shortblade of lightning.  What is the best combo and how good is the SoD really?<br />
<br />
Need some advice please!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Smakz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">BoC procs at lvl 1, SoD doesnt.<br />
<br />
BoC has 50 more raw HP, and the proc is hella more aggro<br />
<br />
BoC is by far a superior weapon<br />
<br />
for offhand, look into something without a proc yet with a good ratio ... Splitblade of destruction comes to mind when you hit later levels.  <br />
<br />
SBoZ is a good offhander till you can use some of the recommended level stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Velle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I disagree. IMHO SoD is better(procs at lvl45 this is only downside). search the forum there are many threads about BoC vs SoD. FYI I had both BoC and SoD. Many ppl just ASSUME by the stats. When you use SoD u will be supprised how well this weapon serves u as good aggro/dps weapon. Not saying that BoC is worse than SoD, but SoD was for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Deadalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Or you could buy a CHoS for 15k and get 90% of the SoD dmg/agro. Your call really ;)</div></div><hr />

woah so you are saying that a weapon that procs enraging blow is worse that a weapon that procs a 268dd.  <br />
<br />
IMO get the BOC the enraging blow &gt; than a dd+stun.  I will fucking hate you guts since I will never own one.  I swear where the fuck do people get all this pp to twink a character with a fucking BOC</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dubb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It's not just that SoD procs a DD, but a DD with a stun component, and also procs more frequently than BoC. Sure the stats on BoC are better, but that doesn't mean it generates more aggro. Heck, BBotE procs a level 16 DD for (I think) 95 damage, but is clearly superior to BoC for generating aggro in my semi-educated opinion.</div></div><hr />

First off it procs 288dd+stun I didn't say it's worse I SAID for me I would choose SoD. 2nd Don't come here and flame ppl cuz you will never have one. I have played this game since it came out. I have worked my ass off to obatain what I have now(or had). If you had worked ur ass off u might have one by now so quit whining like a noob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>victatious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">true a SoD procs ALOT but you know if he can twink a warrior from the get go and get a BoC and lvl why not? i would prefer a BoC at lvl 1 hehehe anyday<br />
