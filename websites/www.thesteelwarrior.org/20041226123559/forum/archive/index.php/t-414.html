And I blew through the old site as well.<br />
<br />
My question is this:  I am tempted to buy, for the guild, a Wavecrasher for an epic'd warrior's off hand for some bigger encounters.<br />
<br />
The question is: after the shammy or chanter lands thier slow, I assume the warrior is going to get the &quot;Your spell would not take hold&quot; message.  If, indeed, that is a correct assumption, does the slow component still generate any taunt?<br />
<br />
If, I get 2 &quot;no&quot; answers than it would be probale to guess that in a situation where there is a slower, then the Wavecrasher is going to be a usless tool for generating taunt/aggro until the shammy/chanter slow wears off.  And heaven forbid that a Vellious encounter would take that long to complete.<br />

<br />
As far as agro from &quot;your spell would not take hold&quot; - you wont get a definitive answer. As a caster I believe that the proc does generate some agro, but not near as much as if the spell lands.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">faederya</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 02:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wavecrasher SUCKS.  /breathes deeply<br />
<br />
Ok, I feel better.  Yes, it does generate &quot;a taunt&quot; when the proc is resisted or does not take hold.  Is the proc any good? no, is the weapon a piece of slow crap? yes  <br />
<br />
Get a Frostbringer for main hand and throw his red epic in offhand. <br />
<br />
/breathes deeply once again<br />
<br />
does the slow component still generate any taunt? <br />
<br />
Yes, taunt is still generated, possibly not as much as if it took hold, but it does get generated.  Mobs head will snap to the proc.</div></div><hr />

On the slow proc generating aggro if it's resisted or not; you do and you don't.  My guess it's not too much at all; myself knowing that when I'd bust out my old Trunch of Doom ( higher % slow proc ) and gotten a slow proc but resisted ( shammy slowed first ); it was...meh...for aggro but still got me a hit or 2 in.<br />
<br />
Ye Auld Wavecrasher is one of them weapons people either love immensely or hate vehemently. Me, i'd be happier with a Black Blade of Tormenting or Praetor's Blade over a Wavecrasher.<br />
I'd say get the gang together and go get him a Willsapper from DN. Much better mileage out of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 04:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">lol<br />
<br />
this is great.  6 months ago when you asked that question, the wavecrasher was as uber as you could get before the epic, and now everyone turns on it like a dog that shit on the floor.  Nothing's changed, so what gives?<br />
<br />
&quot;did not take hold&quot; generates aggro.  I can tank with a TOD on a slowed mob easily, and that wouldn't happen with jut it's awesome DPS.<br />
<br />
If your answer is that it sucks because of it's ratio, that's bullshit too.  Warriors aren't around to do damage, we're here to take it.  Frostbringer proc is NOT significantly better than a wavecrasher.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 04:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">what gives ye ask?<br />
<br />
Mudflation. Game Mechanics. Umm, Trial and Error? Hell, even Expansions change the game tself opening up new variables. Christ 3 Years Ago SSoY's sold for 10K each. WTF does that mean today they should sell for 10K because 3 years ago they were &quot;the shit&quot; ?<br />
<br />
Jeez who pissed in your cheerios?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 05:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We're not talking about price of weapons here, we're talking about weapons quality.  No one pissed in my cheerios, i'm asking a question.<br />
<br />
What tradable weapons came out in SOL or PoP to make the wavecrasher less of a viable weapon?  Right now, the only thing I can think of that &quot;might&quot; be a substitute is the fleshgrinder, and that's more of DPS taunt than real spell aggro.<br />
<br />
How have game mechanics changed?  &quot;does not take hold&quot; still generates aggro, resists still generate aggro, and landed spells still generate aggro.<br />
<br />
I'm calling bullshit on it, and I want to know why you think what was regarded as a god weapon 2 years ago is now regarded as crap when there have been no decent replacements.  The yak sucked when kunark came out because of the snare whip and lamentation.  What makes the Crasher suck now?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
imo, there still havent been any droppable weapons that have come out for the price that can generate similar aggro, albeit the dps on it is pretty sucky</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Roughbeard</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 05:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Id say Frosty mainhand Red Epic offhand would be a decent Aggro combo, unless you can take out Vaniki for a sapper.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Come on Haass, seriously. No one is denying that the proc is good agro, but the proc rate has always been in question. Also, due to the totally asstastic ratio, you are 100% relying on the proc for agro. Unless you are procing like a madman, anyone with high end Velious or better weapons will pull agro with sheer DPS. Any number of no proc 2h weapons would make it VERY hard to keep a mob on you with a WC. I weilded WC+Frosty a year ago and gave it up in favor of SBoZ+Fleshgrinder. Agro was much more consistent because the DPS was insane compared to the WC.<br />
<br />
With 14/22, 15/22, 12+3magic/20 weapon becoming more common in the bazaar, you can't count on a 9/19+proc weapon for agro. When it doesn't proc, it's just a lammy without the STA.<br />
<br />
You put a WC+Frosty combo up against a Windblade or a Greatstaff of Thunder and you will be supremely luck to hold agro. Go defensive and you can forget agro unless you get a whole bunch of procs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 05:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe, that's odd, because I grouped with a monk with 15/20 and 15/18 weapons and I couldn't do JACK OR SHIT to keep aggro with the windblade, or with dual fleshgrinders.   Trying to out DPS the rest of your raid/group isn't going to happen.  That monk was laying on his back half the fight.<br />
<br />
No, you know what, I don't like relying on procs either, but unless you're in extremely good gear, you've gotta pick one or the other.  BOC quality weapons don't exactly drop off yard trash you know.  So you're stuck with the issue of a straight DPS weapon, or, for the majority of the cases, a shitty DPS weapon with a proc that will generate aggro.  I know damned well how much people have to cut their DPS in order for me to hold it with pure DPS.  That's bullshit, and you're never gonna convince me otherwise.  I'm standing right on a mobs toes, no discs on with a windblade and my monk friend with 15/20 15/18 is laying on his back every 10 seconds for the duration of the fight.  You WILL NOT maintain aggro thru DPS unless the rest of your raid/group is being a retard and not contributing as much as they are capable of.<br />
<br />
So, DPS weapons aren't all they're cracked up to be, which leaves you with the shitty weapons with aggro procs, and the wave crasher just happens to fit in that category, and it's on the upper end of the category as well, for non uberguild people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 07:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We'll have to agree to disagree then. My 55 warrior holds agro plenty good, even when I am nuking with my 65 wiz. Sure, it's a work out and no were near as good as a BoC+ weilding warrior, but he does pretty well.<br />
<br />
Warriors aren't around to do damage, we're here to take it.<br />
One thing I find curious is that you mention WB and dual FG, but I don't see a WC+frosty combo in your magelo. Is there a reason you choose to weild lesser agro weapons when you could sell 1 of the above and get a WC+frosty and have plats left over?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Truelove</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 07:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">WC is very nice agro, however its one of those weapons that by the time you get it, or have enough cash, the game throws up other options.<br />
<br />
I tanked with WC Frosty for a while - and it was ok - however if your MA already has his epic I dont hink you are going to do him any favours by off handing red epic and using the WC.<br />
<br />
If you can get a tank his epic - go spank Vaniki in DN for the Wilsapper, 13 20 with a stronger proc will be of far more use long term. Or just make him use the 2hander version - PoP xp tanking with 2hander epic seems quite easy to me</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 07:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We're getting off topic a bit; but not in any of my memory banks was I a fan of the wavecrasher nor would I ever be...yes I have used them a few times ( Gnombs and I think Truelove's ) and it was basically IMHO a lammy/defiance that IF it proc's might do a bit of good.<br />
<br />
But to spent 20-30K on it as the prices were when they were options to my kit...no way in f'in hell would I blow that much coin on it nor would I today for anything other than someone handing it to me which for all intents and purposes is about as likely as being struck by lightning. I'd bet the farm that with a Black Blade of Tormenting and a Praetor Blade I would smoke anyone using a wavecrasher in terms of proc aggro but slack a little in DPS ( comparable weapons of course )<br />
<br />
again, just my .02 .. i ante up the bullshit call. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jakle Attakle</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 07:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I loved the Wavecrasher. It kicked major butt. It was superior to a frostbringer, and still is. I did not think it took a long time to Proc. It was as good as I could get until I got level 60 taunt and my epics.<br />
<br />
Period.<br />
<br />
It works. It worked in HoT, it worked on every single epic fight in the game. Once you are level 60+, have lots of money, or can get your epics, ditch it.<br />
<br />
BTW....<br />
<br />
Level 55-59 = not killing Vaniki with one group of people your level. <br />
<br />
Level 55-59 = not buying BoC's or SoD's unless some kind of trading fool. <br />
<br />
Level 55-59 = Frostys with good damage ratio off hands are WAY outtaunted by Monk Epics and Rogue Epics.<br />
<br />
Use the thing where it belongs. Level 55-59 when you are the MA for your guild/alliance/group of friends.<br />
<br />
The Wavecrasher was the first thing I bought to counteract the Massive DPS jump in Monks and Rogues around that level who get their epics before you. It worked like a charm.<br />

I know there were times it actually did proc and I still wouldnt get a mob to swing my way, if I wasnt in control of agro. If a mob is already slowed I didnt feel the proc did much for taunt either. <br />
<br />
As far as pricing goes no its not worth the 25k-30k it goes for. I traded an Ankelsmasher and about 10k for one and thought the AS/FB combo was superior. Those smithed Ykeshas are a good alternative if you can find someone to make it for you.<br />
<br />
I got rid of the WC pretty quick and picked up a Greatstaff of Thunder and havent regretted it since.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm lazy is what it is.  I have all of that shit, just not in my profile.  Windblade is in my profile for stats, kinda like Furor has that dagger offhand in his profile, but I seriously doubt he tanks with it when he's got a BoW in his bags.  My normal hunting gear is a little different than what my max &quot;virtual dick size&quot; stats are.  I wear a fungi tunic pretty much constantly, dropping my AC a good 40 points.  I use the windblade for DPS now, and I used the fleshgrinders heavily before PoP for DPS, just couldn't bring myself to sell 2 weapons for 20k when I paid 60 a piece for them before PoP, when I found the windblade was more DPS.   Wavecrasher/frosty has always been the most reliable taunt combo I owned, it just wasn't always necessary, depending on what function I played as Haass in that particular encounter.<br />
<br />
I could never make magelo show things in my inventory for some reason after the upgrade to 2.0, so I stopped trying.  It wasn't that important.  And now that I quit EQ, it'll never be important enough to log on to magelo.com again to try :)<br />
<br />
And Shik....<br />
<br />
But to spent 20-30K on it as the prices were when they were options to my kit...no way in f'in hell would I blow that much coin on it nor would I today for anything other than someone handing it to me which for all intents and purposes is about as likely as being struck by lightning.  <br />
<br />
We end up agreeing again, but the camp is easy as hell, and I spent a ton of time in SG.  For 30k, no, I wouldn't buy one, but the camp is easy, especially if you still need velious gems, which I did at the time.<br />
<br />
There is another thread on this board a week or so ago about Windblades, and it was very mixed as well.  Some people find it good aggro, others don't.  It depends very heavily on where you are in your equipment scale and where the people around you are at.  When your rogues and monks are all 55 and with their epics and 41% haste, and your average warrior is still wearing his RBG, he's not gonna be holding any aggro with a dps weapon, period.  You need things like the snare whip, I guess that Praetor's blade that everyone talks so highly of, and IMO, the 2 weapons on the top of the taunt heap...Wavecrasher and Frostbringer.  Is it crap for some people in 65 guilds?  Well duh.  Is it still a fine weapon for 55-60 tanks who are trying to MT to get their guild going in the raid direction?  Absolutely, and I have yet to see anything to convince me otherwise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cyphan</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 11:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In terms of taunting procs, no there really isnt much better for a warrior thats still pre-epic in terms of gear than the WC/Frosty combo. I guess it all depends on the given situation is and what is available to you and your guild.<br />
<br />
Having said that I still think Wavecrasher was not what it was hyped up to be when I got one. This is probably why its getting bashed these days and why theres always 3 or 4 for sale in the bazaar at any given time. Because when we were just little warrior tikes and looked up to the ubers we saw the Wavecrasher as an answer to our taunt problems when in reality it does its job but its not an overpowering weapon like I know I thought it was going to be.<br />
<br />
Again Im sure people have had different experiences with it but thats just my opinion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well no kidding.  Do you think this is because maybe the Greatstaff is in a completely different world when it comes to aggro generation?<br />
<br />
That's like saying you traded your BABS for a Windblade and haven't regretted it.</div></div><hr />
