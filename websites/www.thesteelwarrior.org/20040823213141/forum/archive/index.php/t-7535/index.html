<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>oomwarrior</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">considering they are upping the limit of the LDoN gear to &gt; 1495.  can someone with access to SoE's &quot;open channel&quot; sneak in a question reguarding the possibility of an anger 4 aug in the future?  I know the spirit of the LDoN upgrades are ment to bring the non-raiders upto the GoD level mobs(since most people quit buying GoD/OoW cuz they know they dont stand a snowballs chance in hell when time geared people are having problems.)  but would be good to know if there is a future for anger4 so the lesser people can start saving up the points for it.</div></div><hr />

Agree! would give average joe blow a place to put his anger 3 aug on a 2h weapon be it blunt or slash.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Actually what I'd like to see more is a LDoN weap with 2 slot 4s.  Single proc weaps are not good.<br />
<br />
There is a dearth of good &quot;big iron&quot; weaps in LDoN.  Mayhap something along the lines of fabled exec axe with 2 slot 4s would make a good high end LDoN weap (2100-2800 range).</div></div><hr />

Would be nice but somehow I doubt this would ever happen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If something like the club of the mad researcher had the same slots it has now plus an additional slot 4 so that you could put 2 augs on it that would be huge.  Admittedly it would take me a year of  doing LDoN&quot;s to afford to build the damned thing, but it would actually make the LDoN weapons viable weapons again.  Hell, you could even replace one of the existing aug slots with an additional slot 4 and it would still be a monster and possibly even drive down the price of a BoC to bring it more inline with what it's actually worth in comparison to other aggro weapons that are available.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gimmel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">A decent 2 hander with 2 type 4 slots would be a dream come true for me. It would be so nice to have something for a 2 hander between the GSoT and the BoW that is a bit more accessible than Anathema. Especially if it was an axe  ;)</div></div><hr />

Beyond inproving the LDoN merchant loot tables, I sincerely wish they'd put the Fabled mobs (and add some others) back in the game. They were absolutely perfect for smaller guilds, powerful 2 group raids, etc. with well designed items that were very very nice without being game breaking.<br />

Fabled mobs were the best thing I've seen done in EQ for a long time.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Beldain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yeah, I aggre its a shame that they took out the fabled mobs, Something SoE could do is, if they dont want to mess around with the old content to badly is to make the fabled mobs rare spawns from the reg Mob. So Ghoul lord is a rare and every once in awile Fables Ghoul Lord pops instead!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Only problem with that (silly thought, yeah, I know) is that if a group is actually xping in a named area, the session comes to a screeching halt when the Fabled pops.</div></div><hr />

or make it a quest type thing.  you talk to someone to get him spawnable, then go wax his ass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gobsmash Emgood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Even if a mob poped that you could spawn the fabeled from or kill (same level as mobs in there area) then you would not have that many problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Retnaburn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Be easier to add fabled loot to the ldon merchants.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gobsmash Emgood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Something I have been thinking is missing are +agro % mods, and for the DPS classes -%agro augs and -agro procs.</div></div><hr />

Fabled mobs as near as I could tell didn't interfer with normal camping. The usual mob generally popped. Should the fabled one pop insted, then Wheee!! Either your group has a chance for an item actually worth having at your level, or worse comes to worse, you send out some /tells and put together a mini-raid that can actually manage the kill.<br />
<br />
I guess this ties into LDoN because it suffers badly from the same Stale Factor as many of the old zones. I have 53 Paladin and 55 Druid twinks - forget the fact that I don't even get the pathetic 51AP's for an adventure, forget after getting enough AP's to get an augment in most slots for my main I can't bear zoning into any LDoN adventure anymore. I've seen the loot table and there is very little that actually drops that I want any longer - even for twinks. I'm much better off farming Ornate molds and patterns.<br />
<br />
And that's the definition of stale. Familiar with the terrain, no real challange, no surprises, and no real reason to go there.<br />
<br />
The same exact problems affect old empty zones, LDoN, and rapidly even some GoD content. I frankly don't understand why having a list of a half dozen random named (some harder than others), popping 1 or 2, and each having 6 possible items on their loot table is such a challange to do. This be EverQuest, not EverTedium or EverBored.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>oomwarrior</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">thanx all for the replies.  And while i agree 2 x type 4 slots (ang3 + yak3) &gt; ang4, I still would like to know if there would be any possibility of an ang4 at maybe the 2200 points range?  <br />
<br />
and also another question is if the augs are removable in the future, will we still be able to sell the obsolete one's back to the vender so most people can trade in their ang2's and upgrade to ang3/4 when they earn enough points?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Aye I still love my fabled exec axe heh ferocity/pb/flurry = fun with it.<br />
<br />
It would be fun if they added 2x slot 4 weaps like this to higher pt ldon tables.  It doesnt threaten current content and provides an extension path for the current single group progression.</div></div><hr />
