Bah, the Archaedic Stone of Eluding is uber. <br />

Of course, I have decided that it is called that because the first one was won by a druid and after that it managed to elude me consistently ;p<br />

Seems there are atleast two Mauradon's.  One with demons one with vegtables (unless they are linked in the middle some how)<br />
<br />
Which instance are you referring to here?<br />
<br />
Were a group level 46</div></div><hr />

Hehee...I love that instance.  Loot drops like candy.  Lost the roll on this (http://www.thottbot.com/?i=4450) last night though.../cry<br />

Dang Rogue, hehee.</div></div><hr />

Mauradon looks like two zones at first, but it is actually one.  The &quot;purple side&quot; and &quot;orange side&quot; eventually meet up then go on to the end bosses.  There is a quest that creates a staff, this staff allows you to port beyond the orange and purple straight to the end bosses.  This makes it possible to hit the four end bosses (with the best loot) in less than an hour.  Once you have the staff, you will probably never use the normal entrances again.<br />
<br />
The staff quest starts from some chick standing in a pool on the orange side (before entering instance).  Got to kill a few bosses to finish staff.  Can be difficult until the group gets closer to level 50.</div></div><hr />

I did not finish that quest, but found two different instances one on purple side, one on orange side.  Is this what you are referring too?  The boss for the quest is in an isntance ?<br />
<br />
Fae</div></div><hr />

<br />
Those two different instances (one purple side and one orange side) are actually two different entrances to one big instance.<br />
<br />
The quest to create the staff involves killing two bosses to get parts for staff then a third boss to combine the parts.  All of this takes place in the Mauradon instance.<br />
<br />
It confused the hell out of me too when I first started reading about it.</div></div><hr />

Gotchas .. are the bosses for the quest to get to Inner Maurdon in the instances?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes.  The items come from Celebras and Vyletongue.  Vyletongue is on the left side entrance (purple I think) and celebras is just before the area to inner maraudon, but areas merge up just before there.  You have to decent into a nasty slime pit type area before him.</div></div><hr />

Grey is right.  It is EXTREMELY useful for at least one person your group to have the staff that ports you in to the Earth Song Falls.  From there you can easily round-trip the named in an hour and even backtrack to Celebras if the fucker didn't drop your druid headdress the first 38301010138 times killing him.  Ahem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Isk</div><div class="date">02-18-2005, 02:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yes, it's advised to take out the slimes from range, preferably with a cold mage or two.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greysen</div><div class="date">02-18-2005, 03:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Seeing this thread has been totally hijacked.. ^^<br />
<br />
The slow moving globby slimes real source of damage comes from the poison.  If you have a competent tank and your group isn't stupid, beating down multiples should be significantly less of problem as the poison is only damaging 1 person.  Its when it starts getting spread out that you have real problems (Does like 200 a tick.)<br />
<br />
Also, preferred farm path is to port in, go up to celebras, drop down.. work your way up to landslide &amp; princess, drop down off the ledge to gank rotgrip (there is a spot in the center that no hydras wander), and foot your way back through the weaklings to the goblin.  He drops a real nice gun for warrior pulling, has 1.7 delay I do believe.</div></div><hr />

You have to kill Vyletongue and Noxion for the two peices for the staff I thought.  Each is near(er) a separate entrance.  Once you have both you kill Celebras and then give them to his spirit.</div></div><hr />

Oops, yeah, you're right.  It's not too hard to backtrack to either Vyle or Noxx from either entrance tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">faederya</div><div class="date">02-21-2005, 08:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you for information on Maurdon.  We went through purple, killed Lord, went around to Noxxion and wiped 4 times.  He seems to disapear / untargetable for a brief period then atleast 20 little minions spawn.  Goodness gracious that was insane, the last time we thought we controlled the adds then the Spewed Larvae comes in and its all over.  We can easily kill the Princess lady in Arathi Mnts, she spawns adds very similar to Noxxion.  We are lvl 47.  <br />
<br />
My question, are we just to young to kill Noxxion, is Noxxion supposed to disapear during the fight, and are ALL those adds normal?</div></div><hr />
