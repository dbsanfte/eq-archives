<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Daramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">13 goddamn RZ raids, 6 wins, our second BoW drops and I have the DKP so the fucker is mine mine mine. All the sweeter because our last 3 raids people made stupid mistakes, twice not even people in our damned raid ended up screwing us over on RZ himself and we lost. Our raid leader quit due to burnout the last time this happened, it wasn't just about RZ but failing an event where one person can screw over the work of 50 other people completely accidentally didn't help. I'm now raid leader, spent the first week in total fear of RZ, but tonight decided we needed to get the monkey off our back... Flawless TZ, flawless VZ, four people dead in fake RZ. Real RZ died as fast as I've ever seen him die personally, and Hallelujah, a BoW drops. Loot announced, it's warrior priority, and I'm at least one tier ahead of all the other warriors, GIMME!!!!<br />
<br />
And some bastard ninja loots the fucking thing. Not even on our raid, we think it was a druid that couldn't even use it, but I'm not going to ruin the guy's already less than perfect rep by saying who we think it was until a GM confirms. But how fucking frustrating is this? Now I have to spend my time online in a fucking petition queue.<br />
<br />
ARGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!<br />
<br />
Some people's parents shoulda just shot themselves rather than bring such goddamn selfish pricks into the world.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Daramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Oh and before someone says we shoulda locked the corpse so it couldn't happen...<br />
<br />
We had two SoS rogues, 2 monks and an SK feigned all at the corpse. The guildleader had the corpse locked. The fucker sat there spamming loot so he could get into the corpse while we were doing lev/invis and getting people the flag (mostly folks not in our guild that we brought along for backflags).<br />
<br />
The loot window bumped the corpse locker out automatically, and before he could reloot fuckface zoomed in and ninja's the BoW.<br />
<br />
There are no words to express how pissed I am at this guy. The only reason we're not 100% sure it was him is because the between the corpse being so fucking huge and about 20 adds being on it, no one saw him do it directly. But it's real suspicious seeming when no one on your raid looted the thing, and Druid Cumstain manages to die within 10' of the RZ corpse 3 minutes after he drops, this same druid having ninja'd an RZ flag from a guild that denied his app and being known as an all-around fuckup and &quot;HELL NO&quot; not on our raid.<br />
<br />
And then he asked us for a rez, claiming he'd been in pig room. Um, yeah, so you're in pig room and run out to RZ's corpse, die to the swarming shitpile of adds, and then ask us for a rez 30 minutes later? Fishy, very fishy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Batem Tuhates</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">That sucks, but the sad thing is I can't say that I'm surprised.  Unfortunately I’m sure every server has there list of trouble toons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Doomflayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Another reason EQ sucks. They could have instanced zones, but NOOOO, not only do you have ninja idiots, but whole guilds dedicated to screwing the entire server over. Block progress of lower guilds at ALL costs, train, etc</div></div><hr />

*edit-shikarii again .. man, who'd thought 3 letters would kick my a$$:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Barja Bardagi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Way back in our start, we lost a Cloak of Flames off of Naggy to a druid this way... Except he was IN our raid.  Well, needless to say, he was busted, he evac'd to NK I think it was.  The GM logged on a few min later, looked at the logs, and tried to talk to him.  The thief logged out.<br />
<br />
The GM was great.... He laughed and said he loved it when folks did that... Logged the thief on himself, summoned him to Naggy's Room, handed the cloak over and camped him out right there.  Apparently, after we finished and left, the GM also respawned Naggy to be waiting for the druid....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Batem Tuhates</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">GM's Can be cool when they want to ... I've had a quite a few help me out when I needed it. Usually when I logged on totally trashed. ( EQ + Totally Trashed usually = somthing bad for your toon) <br />
<br />
One night I logged on after being out drinking all night and spent 3 or so hours swimming in OOT, with no clue where I was. I guess a Guildie got a GM for me or somthing because the next thing I knew I was summoned to land. The GM had a good laugh at me. I never play that intoxicated anymore</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Daramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Definitely legit Shikarii, and yeah, I get a shiny new sword sometime as soon as a GM can get back to me. Thinking about calling in sick to work!<br />

&quot;teh&quot; is cool for 1liners, but using it throughoutly in an entire post is kinda retarded :-/</div></div><hr />

n00bs, all of you :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">This happened on Prexus a couple weeks ago.<br />
<br />
The ninja looter was Sinbien (level 57 half elf warrior who has changed his name to Mauvin since). He first said he didn't do it, then said he didn't knowit was no drop, then said he was holding it for the guild that killed RZ while they cleared adds, then finally admitted wrong doing.<br />
<br />
He got the BoW taken away and the proper recipient got it from the GM. Sinbien was never suspended/banned, only got a warning. He ran around for a week wielding the thing showing it off before the GM's finally did something.<br />
<br />
Had a cleric ninja a protective dust cape off behemoth about a month back too. She kept flat out denying it even tho everyone in the raid saw the loot msg.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tricsun-Drinal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">if your story is legit; grats on your BoW. the GM will fix the problem and deal with the ninja. <br />
<br />
To bad that's not always true.  We had some tool ninja loot the earring off RZtW about a month and a half ago.  Everyone in guild petitioned, GL sent emails, we even had a GM admit that it was ninja looted by the guy we suspected (who has had more problems with everyone on the server than anyone can count).  And not one thing has been done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Daramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I now have a conversation with the person we think did it, logged and reported, where he admits he looted it. If that doesn't get GM response I don't know what will.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Why would a druid want a BoW? :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Daramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">He claims his brother who doesn't play EQ was trying to loot his corpse.<br />
<br />
This same druid has a pretty bad rep in Tactics, and several pieces of his story don't match up with the logs we have of what happened, so I can't say what he was thinking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>akamek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Yeah, like Payn said... Sinbien did that not too long back on Prexus.  He got flagged from all the barbraids.  Those of you who aren't familiar with Prexus.  Raurck (SP) a barb war hosts flagging raids mainly to help those who are guildless, not much time, etc get flagged for higher tier PoP.  Well here comes Sinbien 57 war who just ran behind a Talionis kill of RZtW and nunja's the BoW, which I believe was going to Cmedie already.  Well Sinbien got his hand slapped w/a ruler, Cmedie got his BoW and I believe I read Sinbien changed his name to Mauvian or something like that lol.  Iono tho, I had been gone for a few weeks and didn't know about it.... runnin through PoT and I see some dude w/a BoW and only Baron title... I was like wtf ran up inspected sure nuff there was the BoW, along with some rygorr leggs, hero bracer, orc fang earing etc.  Honestly it was kinda funny in a sickening way.  <br />
Oh well I'm out, later all.<br />
Aka</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>czai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">You'd think the GMs would respond quicker and more favorably to the injured parties....<br />
<br />
It's crap like this, and overpopulated servers, that will drive me to WoW/other games.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Daramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Almost 3 days later, my character has been logged in 100% of the time except for patch downtime. I've had to put the petition back in the queue because of the two patches. I've never had a Guide contact me themselves, but when I contact them they tell me my petition is escalated to the GM level. Yesterday they told me my petition is the first on the queue, but apparently no GM logged into Xev all night, or they ignored my petition.<br />
<br />
Today I called tech support, just to hear a human voice talk to me about my damn petition, and the guy said he could see my petition and that it was assigned to someone. He said &quot;they probably have it on their desk to deal with&quot;. This was from me sending in email when it happened... I have no idea if these are separate systems, but suspect they are, because that's the kind of BS Sony tech support would pull.<br />
<br />
How long does it take to fix this kind of shit? Should I not bother staying logged in? It's kind of annoying to spend all day checking to see if my petition is in the queue and if a Guide or GM is online for me to ask directly. I have a goodamn macro for that now...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Kadah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Okay speaking from expirance.<br />
Your prolly SoL.<br />
I accidently looted a orb from Rhag 1 instead of lucinite piece, and I petitioned and the injuried party petitioned and well, the GM said, Thanks for admitting your mistake but there isnt a thing we can do to transfer no drop gear.<br />
<br />
I even went to the server GM with it on the phone, All to get this one lil orb transfered to the person it belonegd to because I felt horrid.<br />
<br />
Anyway long story short, They didnt do shit for me or the lady (except for saying thanks for being honest &gt;&lt; ) <br />
Ah well, I  bought her C5 and two FT2 wrists to fix the goof. (200k buh bye ~ )<br />
<br />
<br />
GM's suck. end of story</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">&quot;How long does it take to fix this kind of shit?&quot;<br />
<br />
If I were you (and this is just a theory, since you sound desparate to try new avenues) ... I'd try to make sure you were logged on and at keyboard during regular business hours, INDIA time.<br />
<br />
:-(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Daramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I have been online, 24x7 except for patch times. I have had logs on, and an AFK message that makes things clear. I haven't received a tell from a guide or a GM that wasn't in response to a tell I sent them. Hell, I haven't seen a GM at all, so I definitely haven't gotten any tells from them.<br />
<br />
Today I was told by a respected Sr Guide on our server, someone who has been doing this for a long time that&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well we rarely see GM's on these days, I am sorry to say so I can't really give you an idea of the length of time to expect.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I've seen players wait on an SOE GM for weeks at a time. Your best bet is simply to continue to make sure your petition is in the queue with /viewpet and if not repetition immediately&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If after two weeks you haven't gotten a GM to help you, you can email eqcs@station.sony.com.&quot;<br />
<br />
These are direct quotes...<br />
<br />
As far as getting the item, I've seen them return ninja-looted items in the past and heard many people say that they've had items returned, so I'm not as concerned about that. However it seems like it might be a long wait... :(<br />
<br />
I'm not exactly desperate, but I sure do wish this was resolved already. I figured by being online all the time I could get it resolved quickly, but the only time I see guides on is 4pm-8pm PST, and GM's I never see.<br />
<br />
I called up tech support today to ask them about my email (I sent email too). They could see my request and said it was assigned to someone, but that they had no idea how long it'd be. To quote that person, &quot;it's probably waiting on their desk at this point.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>seveirn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Had RZ ninjaed from myself here, think they got a BoW and boots of the warmaster .. Ended up getting it back, now the person has been rejected from every guild on the server =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Jarelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">We had a BP of Statue of Rallos Zek ninjaed by a low level Kael tracker around a year ago....took a few days, but it got sorted. Ninja wasnt banned, we found out the main, and he's still playing...claims his brother logged him on and did it....as usual lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Dafrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Had a no drop loot get ninja'd by a corpse spammer waiting for unlock. He got the unlock and looted the no drop loot. Anyhow, after realizing the entire guild would devalue his name on the server message boards he, the ninja looter, apologized and waited for a guide to address the problem The officers stayed at the location the ninja took place, along with the offender. The offender admitted to his act of ninja looting, and wished the no drop item be awarded to the rightful owner (me winning the DKP bid).<br />
<br />
What did we get from all this? Nothing. We even reported the lines where the offender admitted to ninja'ing and wanting to fix the wrong and willing to stay till the issue was resolved. All in all with all this evidence and uncontested unanomous validation of what happened - nothing.<br />
<br />
I certainly hope you get your BOW, but from a personal side - someone who has used the &quot;send an email to your GM&quot; forum numerous times, and petitioned also via game - I have received nothing except automated response about me sending the request for a GM to contact me(none ever has on four separate issues - even after sending in the email to speak to your GM multiple times at the request of the guides).<br />
<br />
I hope you get your BOW as I think you should.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Doomflayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Time to move on, this game has gone to total crap unless you play on Legends. Ninja looting USED to get you banned, GMs USED to be on regular servers. Not anymore, if this incident hasn't convinced you WoW isn't going to be a MUCH better game, NOTHING WILL! Blizzard just powns SOE when it comes to customer service.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">there was a rogue that ninjad a ornate plate bp from my friends guild</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Nord</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I've seen it take 2-3 weeks before a GM reimbursed ninja'ed items.  And since you have a log where the idiot actually admitted looting it, the only problem you'll have is waiting for the GM to get back to you.<br />
<br />
Oh, and this made me chuckle:<br />
He claims his brother who doesn't play EQ was trying to loot his corpse. <br />
<br />
Ah, the standard &quot;It wasn't me it was my brother/sister/friend/dog&quot;.  Really, someone needs find people like this and send their Dad a card on Father's Day saying &quot;You should have pulled out.  Seriously.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Doomflayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I don't care who was playing the toon, if you are dumb enough to let someone play your account, you are responsible for their behavior with that toon anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Gazu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I just want to say - I agree with Batem Tuhates - I had a simular experience - I was doing circles and drowning under the statue/fountain thingy in the center of Oggot - I fell in the water after walking out of the bank - A buddy of mine just kept laughing at me - must have had like 31 corpses on the bottom of the lake there - Man was I shitfaced - tring to use my arrow keys - everything was so bright - ahh hahaha - GM gave me all my EXP back - got rid of corpses - and bumped me off the server while laughing at me. I'll never forget that - hehehee. Ohh yea - I was bound on the ledge in front of the bank - just kept falling into the water - MAN was I an idiot - hehe - and who the hell knows what I was thinking ... LOL<br />

So in short - my experience with GM's has always been a good one - be patient things will resolve themselves.<br />

<br />
I had two good experiences with GM Keridon on the Stromm server while doing Coldain ring quests. <br />
<br />
In the first incident, the guy we were escorting for 7th ring didn't give the ring back the way he's supposed to. We completed the escort mission successfully, the script worked alright, only no ring. GM Keridon gave me back the 6th ring and the shackle key so we could re-do the 7th ring. <br />
<br />
In the second incident, Garadain accepted the 7th ring and gave me the note to spawn the orc war --- only the npc you give the note to was not up. Before she could re-spawn, the server had to be patched. Poof 7th ring. GM Keridon restored it so that I could start over (this time with both quest mobs spawned).<br />
<br />
Each of these petitions took about a week to get answered, by the way.<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />
