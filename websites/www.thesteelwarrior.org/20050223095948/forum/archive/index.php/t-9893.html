I'm only a lvl 40 warrior right now, but i don't like the idea of leaving my guild...Right now i have 3 options...<br />
<br />
1) Stay with EQ 1<br />
2) Switch to EQ 2<br />
3) Play both :eek: EQ 1 is playable on a laptop, right? Then upgrade current computer to play EQ 2...What is the monthy rate for EQ 2? is it the same $13 a month?</div></div><hr />

<br />
 If you're interested, try it. If you like it, play one or both. I can't see just dropping EQ if you're still enjoying yourself, though. Most people I know running out the door are those for whom the game became boring long ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iksargo</div><div class="date">12-01-2004, 01:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, so, where can I find this all access pass? So it's $3 above the normal EQ 1 monthly cost? So it was be ~$16 US to play both EQ 1 and EQ 2?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am having so much fun, I gave my EQ paly to a friend who had never made it to the elementals.  I have no desire to fire up EQ as of right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikken</div><div class="date">12-18-2004, 09:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">EQ is $12.99 a month, all access $21.99 so it's a difference of $9.00 a month.<br />
<br />

<br />
Oh, how I wish this were true. SWG is not on the all access plan. Planetside, EQ, EQ2, and EQ(ps2), and some other crappy games not worth mentioning are on the plan. Its actually quite a steal if you would like to be able to play on or more of those games.<br />
<br />
I've said it elsewhere that if SWG got put on all access, SOE could have my first-born. Still no word if they are ever going to take me up on the offer...<br />
<br />
I'm playing EQ and EQ2, whichever suits my mood at the time. Occasionally, I'll log on to the lagfest planetside. I do mean lag, not framerate. Its a shame that the best battles nearly always dwindle down because such large numbers of people can't play in one area. I thought that was the whole point ot he game was big battles, huge force against another huge force. Last I logged in, it really has become zerging empty bases because defense and opposition can't fight it out over bases without bringing the server to its knees.<br />
<br />
Enough blabbering, you can play both. EQ2 still has a lot of server downtime ironing bugs out, and servers are still rebooting every day, so EQ fans will have plenty of time to at least log on to chat with old friends. EQ2 really doesn't replace EQ, they really are 2 different styled games. I like EQ when I want to lay back, EQ2 when I have a bit more attention available to expend on the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spockmaster</div><div class="date">12-19-2004, 03:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i let  my EQ subscription run out because i was having much more fun on EQ2, i dont think ill be going back.  I was kind of stalled out at lvl 58 while my guild was also stalling out.  I have much more fun on EQ2, but its going to be harder to lvl up some more because i havent been able to play much and im still only lvl 13.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikken</div><div class="date">12-22-2004, 02:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think EQ2 levels as slowly as original EQ leveled. I'm not cometely sure though. you'd have to egt an old timer that plays EQ2 to tell ya. I know I play pretty hard core and I've only made it to 23/22 guardian/armorer, which I guess equals a low 30's pure adventurer. Of course there are people that have made it much further, even to 50, but I've done just about every quest pre-20 and I'm working on a full quest log more of quests. I spend most of my time questing, which is kinda slow, cause most people don't quest a lot, and its nearly impossible to solo an even con quest after 10. So, I mostly kill grey(no xp) or green group mobs because there are so few solo mobs, even less since the con nerf. Supposedly, the next patch is bringing more solo encounters for people like me.<br />
<br />
I hope this does, I really like most things in the game right now. Its just that the tradeskill dependancies, very little solo content, and weak player power is very frustrating. I can deal with the weak classes, I'm masocistic enough to make it work, but not having an appreciable amount of solo content, and even less solo quest content, and no solo tradeskills makes it very hard to stay when I know what WoW like.<br />
<br />
Every hour that I play it seem I'm encouraged to go play WoW. I tihnk the game has a lot of potential, much moreso than WoW (totally unfounded opinion), but so did SWG. Don't get me wrong, the devs learned a lot about what went wrong with SWG, but I think they didn't learn everything they could. I'm not a game developer, I don't study game theory or go to game conferences, or summits, I just know that I don't like *encouraged* grouping in the form that the EQ2 devs have given us. In my mind, *encouraged* grouping seems more like forced grouping. I don't play MMOs because I like team accomplishments. I don't feel more satisfied from a group effort. I play because the gqames are unusually hard compared to most RGP type games on the market. They play for much longer times that a single player will give me. I do like to chat and socialize while playing to some extent, but I'm not going to stand around in PoK for 4 hours every night talking to strangers, because I think its fun. I don't think LFG is fun...ever. I like to challenge myself, and push boundaries with my play. Most players want to grind xp for endless hours, I can't stand grinding. I'd rather be out exploring, or fighting new monsters, or uncovering new riches, even if I'm the 999999999999 person to do so. It's new to me. I came to the game 3 years after it came out.  Everything I ever did in the game had been thousands of time over in EQ before me. I still took my druid to under used zones and dungeons, did funny little quests that I found along the way, and I had fun. Solo was an option in EQ because I was a) over powered for the content or b) by chance choose the right class as my first character, a druid that was perfect for soloing. it wasn't until much later, when I had lots of friends a lot fo commitment in EQ that I rolled a warrior and twinked him out and leveled him to my main. The only reason I played  warrior was because I had a good strong guild, that needed more dedicated tanks, and warriors were sparse. I loved playing a warrior in EQ, Vikken was a powerful and central wheel in the groups he was in. I lead and directed many adventures from that role.<br />
<br />
That feeling isn't there in EQ, although most of the EQ feel is there, I think they missed that potion. Character power does not progress, as far as I've seen, like it does in EQ. Never at any point yet in the game have I said to myslef, wow, I rule. now its a totally trival thing to many I guess to feel powerful in an imaginary world, but to me, its a very important reason why I play. You could gleen all sorts of psycological BS from that, and I suppose it'd be true, to some extent. I don't play a game to go enter a world where I'm no more powerful or infulential than in real life. That's what it comes down to, adn I suspect many play for the same reason. its the reason why fantast exists. Drizzt was a weakling, why the hell am I playing a weakling. Or even better, how come Morden Rasp, a rogue, can go trampsing through GoD (the last expansion I played) with nothing more than a toy caster at his side, while I have to carry a force of 6 charcters, geared to the teeth, just to fight in the experience zones, never mind the zone thay he progressed through solo until his friend caught up to him.<br />
<br />
Ok, that was waaaaaaay more than I was going to write, but as things usually go, I ended up saying more than I intended. I didn't want to sound like I think that EQ2 is a crap game. It's not, its very fun, but for my style of play, unless some changes are made, i can't see me investing much more time in the game. I'm a masocistic to a degree, not to a point. I'll move on if I stay unhappy with how the game is progressing. Probably before the year is up, as I'm certain, one of my friends is going to buy me WoW for christmas.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I also played a warrior as my main in EQ1, and i too enjoyed the feeling of power you speak of...its more of a sense of the importance of the role you play in the goal to be achieved i think, but it probably mostly comes down to power. =)<br />
<br />
I must disagree however, i have seen more solo mobs and quests added in the last few patches and it seems that this time the developers are dedicated to giving us, the players, what we ask for. I love being the tank for a good group in a good dungeon, but if i feel like it i can go solo even con mobs in a zone so huge there are over 100 people in it and i cant see a soul.  As a warrior, to be able to solo! *gasp* i have said to myself at several points, &quot;Wow, I rule!&quot;<br />
<br />
This is an amazing game, i dont think i can ever go back to EQ1 except to talk to some friends i played with for years. I will probably play EQ2 for some time to come.<br />
<br />
P.S. i cant say anything bad about WoW though, my roomate plays and i think it looks and sounds like a game on par with EQ2. i choose EQ2 just as a matter of history (i played eq1 for over 2 years) and the continuity of the lore appeals to me more...i loved warcraft 3 though...still play that when the servers are down =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, what more is there to say then this. I cancelled 3 EQ1 accounts, 2of which were 65+. The mentality is different and it's NOT ALL RAIDING... something I am totally thrilled about. I also find myself trying to figure out what I am going to do on my list of quests, guild events, etc... as opposed to logging into the EQ1 and wondering where or what to do. I left EQ1 and haven't looked back, which is too bad b/c I should sell or give some gear away to friends =)</div></div><hr />

Why so many people that put in so much time in EQ1 would want to leave for a game that doesnt even come close to the feeling that EQ1 has given for years.<br />
<br />
Well i am never leaving EQ1.  Well ok, maybe when i have exhausted every zone in the game with every class there is to play AND have gotten the best gear for every class AND maxed out thier AA's AND Maxed out all tradeskills with one of them AND every guild has disappeared AND i can walk to any zone at any time and say CAMP CHECK and hear nothing.  Then and ONLY then will i be done with EQ1.<br />
<br />
Cmon people, for many of us this game started us playing MMORPG's.  I hold the game high and respect Verant/Sony for the creation of it.<br />
<br />
And no im not some low life with no friends or family who has nothing more to do in life than play a video game. (that would be my neighbor)  I have a wife and 2 kids and a very normal life.  <br />
<br />
I have tried lots of MMORPG's since EQ and NONE of them have been near as fun.<br />
<br />
But hey, thats just my opinion. :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Well, i put alot of time into EQ1, but i am a person that likes new things. That feeling that EQ1 gave me got old about 2 years ago...and i like the feel of EQ2 a hell of alot better...i think you would too, if you gave it a chance...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">01-12-2005, 02:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I cant believe my ears!  Why so many people that put in so much time in EQ1 would want to leave for a game that doesnt even come close to the feeling that EQ1 has given for years.Have you tried EQ2? I thought the same thing you did until I gave it a chance. To put it in to perspective, I cancelled a 68+300ish wizard with OoW+ gear and a 67+130ish warrior with Time+GoD gear. Both toons are flagged for everything, both toons were in end game guilds that both imploded after EQ2 and WoW came out.<br />
<br />
Sony really nailed it with EQ2. Plate looks like plate, chain looks like chain, and I have yet to see 2 toons that look alike. The world feels huge again, there is actually a sense of apprehension when going in to dungeons. I've actually felt like a noob for the first time in over 4 years. The graphics are better by a lot, the combat anaimations are numerous and much better thought out, even simple things like following that damn glowing trail work a lot better than in EQ1. Tradeskills, while a pain to learn, are highly profitable and the goods that are player made rival dropped loot. Quests are well thought out and plentiful. The attention to detail is so much better than it was in EQ1 that you will be finding little nuanses for months. Just the other day I noticed that KOS mobs that con grey cower in your presence. NPCs look at you when you walk by, even if you don't talk to them.<br />
<br />
I recommend that everyone at least give EQ2 or WoW a shot. I would be very surprised if someone actually picked EQ1 over either of these games.</div></div><hr />

Hey! I am still lurking around, just in the middle of getting ready to move to the east coast.<br />

So where is everyone that is playing EQ2 posting?? There doesn't seem to be any good places to discuss EQ2 Guardian/Zerker issues  and starts.</div></div><hr />

Pretty simple though - I can't play EQ while the wife is away in order to preserve any kind of sanity in the house. Makes it hard to play with your buds when everyone logs off an hour after you are just getting on. So the natural thing to do is move 3 time zones east so that wife's bedtime = west coast prime time ;)<br />

Yes its worth leaving EQ1 if you are tired of dealing with massive guilds and the corporation type mentality required to keep that structure in place .<br />
<br />
EQ2 offers alot more independence and I really enjoy it alot, I tried going back to EQ1 but it was so, well please no flames, primitive compartively.<br />
<br />
Anyway as folks say make up your own mind, there is no right or wrong general answer here, but it is a different kind of fit than EQ1.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wandor I use the official EQ2 SOE forums but they really are lacking after the structure you guys have run here.  Wish we could expand the EQ2 content of this board so as to give a place to have some structured conversations regarding Bers/Guards (there is SO much whining on official EQ2 boards).<br />
<br />
I play a 32 Bers on guk server if anyone is in the neighborhood.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">01-31-2005, 07:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only thing keeping me in EQlive is my guild.  I've known many of them for 4+ years, and I'm the beefiest tank in the guild by far.  (Family guild,  I busted my ass and got 6200 unbuffed hps, pathetic by endgame standards, but godlike to them)  So I still log in once or twice a week to grind some xp or try to get a gear upgrade or two in OoW, and show up for the scheduled raids just to help the guild and keep the friendships alive.  That having been said, EQ2 guardians are gods compared to EQ warriors.  If anything, I almost have too many abilities.  Many times I feel like a bard in EQlive.  Click, click, click, click constantly for the whole fight.  Also, as has been previously stated, the detail in the game is awesome, and there is always something productive to do.  So far, I can still solo just as well at level 25 as I could at lvl 12.  I typically pick on yellow con mobs when I'm soloing to get the most bang for my buck.  Player made items rock, but it's also not uncommon to get really good drops, upgrades at times, from group mobs.  Also, the quests are not unbearable in difficulty and usually yield items that you'll actually use.  All things considered EQ2 owns EQlive, so if you're just looking to play the best game of the 2, EQ2 is way better in my opinion.  Just the social aspect keeps me in EQlive.</div></div><hr />

The one thing I do suggest is that if you are playing EQ2 do not base your decision to stay or go until you get into your 20s.<br />
<br />
Most people judge EQ2 by the first 10-15 levels and this is just not fair.  EQ1 as good as it is was not all that great at the lower levels.  <br />
<br />
With that said, EQ2 is far from the perfect game and there are many places that EQ1 has implemented mechanics better, but looking at the mix of players and the potential that exists, I find EQ2 to be more interesting as a warrior.</div></div><hr />

Personally, I was desperate to replace eq1.  I was hesitant to make a permanent move like I always am with new games, but after about a month, i gave my main eq1 account away, and cancelled my other 5 :p<br />
<br />
The tradeskill system in eq2 seems really fun and interesting when you first start, if not overwhelming.  Unfortunately, once you figure it all out, it's still just a boring grind most of the time.<br />
<br />
Heritage quests and instanced dungeons are the selling point for me.  Nektropos Castle is so much damned fun, and well designed, and the progression just makes sense...not something you can say for much of the latest eq1 instances.  I just hope they go with the instanced dungeons like Nek castle in the future expansions, it's what I've always wanted in RPGs.<br />
<br />
I will never knock eq1, and I'm not going to try to tell anyone to leave, but eq2 is certainly worth a shot for anyone getting burnt out.<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit -- Oh, and since I changed games, I play about ~50% of the time that I did in eq1, not because It's not as fun, but because I'm not spending 8 hours a sitting beta testing bugged raids :cool:</div></div><hr />

A little grind, good xp and usually good loot while working on keys.</div></div><hr />

SWG is not on the all access plan. Planetside, EQ, EQ2, and EQ(ps2), and some other crappy games not worth mentioning are on the plan. Its actually quite a steal if you would like to be able to play on or more of those games.<br />
<br />
I've said it elsewhere that if SWG got put on all access, SOE could have my first-born. Still no word if they are ever going to take me up on the offer...<br />
<br />
They heard you and are eagerly awaiting your first born !!<br />
<br />
SWG is now part of the All Access Pass.</div></div><hr />
