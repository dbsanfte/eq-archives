<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Conanix</div><div class="date">06-26-2004, 04:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok  I have been coming here for a lil over a year  now and would really love a down and dirty truth about my gear. What should i go after for upgrades? Is  my gear ok? good? or does it suck? Any info would be  great. I am at my wits end as far as what upgrades i should be getting. <br />
Right now the places I can go are. Tactics, all  tier one planes.  all SSRA named (except we have yet to do cursed) except for Emp. Almost keyed for it tho.<br />
Thanks in advance guys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frostpaw</div><div class="date">06-26-2004, 05:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">IMO your gear is nice for the stuff you are killing. Heres a few things that are pretty attainable for the slots you probably would like to replace first:<br />
<br />
LDON: From Hard LDoN could go for Warlords Gaunts and Mana-Threaded Bone Bracer, and maybe even that haste back out of EF. Points for weapon augs too :)<br />
Ssra: Belt from Blood in Ssra would be nice upgrade and neck from Arch Lich is solid.<br />
PoP:  Visor of Endless Sight from Tallon Zek.  If you guys kill Inny he drops Corrupted Valorium Bracer and Rusted Wicked Faceguard, both nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kilzalot</div><div class="date">06-26-2004, 05:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looking at your guilds homepage it looks like you are just starting into SoL content, so it looks to me that your right about where you need to be.  Hit Ssra hard and move on to VT.  Some items you could watch for would be the neck from the AL, Ring from Emp, of course a Bloodfrenzy and H8giver.  I really don't think your gonna have any trouble tanking anything in Ssra or around that level of content.  I would suggest saving some LDoN adv points and getting some Anger 3 augs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Conanix</div><div class="date">06-26-2004, 08:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you all verry much.  We are just starting into SoL sort of. We skipped most of velious and went to PoP with an ally. They broke so we went to SSRA and soon VT. Cursed will be down when we can find him up. Same with EMP i think. I got this neck because its ST key and i have never been. So i bought it incase i can ever get some people to go,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nilana</div><div class="date">06-26-2004, 10:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Your gear looks pretty good for where you are.  My guild is currently farming vt and starting on tier 1 pop if you want to look at some of the things I have won in your near future.   The first suggestion I can really give would be look into Spirit wracked cord.   Not only does this give you a 100hp arm/wrist/shoulder,  you also get an 85hp ring which would be a nice upgrade for you as well.  I would also agree with the other posters and say LDON would help you alot.  40hp augs, armor and anger augs would do you great.  You may also want to look into the amygaden chain mask (I am sorry I probably butchered that spelling)  It would upgrade your mask a good bit.<br />

I hope this helps!</div></div><hr />
