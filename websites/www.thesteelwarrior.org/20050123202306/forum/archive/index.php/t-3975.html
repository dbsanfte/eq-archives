<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tappy</div><div class="date">10-31-2003, 11:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm looking for a quick and cheap way to upgrade my agro setup from my GSoT...and I think the best thing I can see right now would be adding a LDoN anger proc to it.  The AngerII proc aug (+400 Hate) is only 510 points in EF, while the AngerII proc (+600 hate) is 1150 points.<br />
<br />
The GSoT plus either one of these should hold pretty solid agro.<br />
<br />
Anybody tried this out?</div></div><hr />

GSoT works great for me when XPing, but isn't the greatest for raid tanking. Add the anger to it and I am sure it'd be superb agro for XP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kurim</div><div class="date">10-31-2003, 02:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm a MA for a NToV-raiding guild.  I can't really comment on stuff higher than that level of content.  On the other hand, Anger 3 on my GSoT was one of the largest improvements to gameplay that I've seen since... er, well quite a while.  Although I can't say I've seen dramatic raid aggro increase, I have seen improvement.  XP group wise, the nukers &amp; slowers I group with regularly have commented frequently on the increase in aggro.<br />
<br />
If the question is, how does that stack up to an EB weapon or something along those lines, I wish I could tell ya ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kendolekk</div><div class="date">10-31-2003, 02:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As far as plain old XP goes, GSoT = CHSD/Red Epic approximately. I usually use the GSoT simply for DPS increase.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flair</div><div class="date">10-31-2003, 02:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I replied to this in another thread but my experience with GSoT and anger 2 has been rather spectacular in run of the mill LDoN groups/exp groups.  For the cost of a GSoT and 510pts a fairly robust and economic agro solution.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerald</div><div class="date">10-31-2003, 04:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would not spend the points for Anger3 to use on a weapon that you'll likely be replacing in the near future. Anger2 would probably be a better compromise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wompem Ondahed</div><div class="date">10-31-2003, 05:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What would the average casual player likely upgrade to besides SoD+BoC? I'm not in a raiding guild, we have done Vindi, thats about it. I used GSoT and 10 seconds of solo then called assist, had aggro till 5 seconds into Enrage.<br />
<br />
I don't mean to seem sarcastic, it is a serious question for those of us with small guilds or short playtimes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you do less, than do anger II or Ykesha (both 510 points) to get max effect asap!<br />
<br />
More agro = more people like you = more groups = more points!<br />
<br />
Wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee</div></div><hr />
