<br />
We fetched the expedition via Gamesh to just XP in.  Didn't want to do the actual trial.  Was hoping to get some named to pop for some geomancy stones, etc.  Cleared most of the first 3 rooms and had no luck.<br />
<br />
Is there a PH, or can any mob be a PH?  It also seemed to be rumored that named won't show on track anymore as well. <br />
<br />
One tip I read was to clear around 20 or so mobs and just keep killing those till a named pop.   I tried that but didn't seem to work.</div></div><hr />
