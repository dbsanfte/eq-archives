<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Daggorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Guild is doing the 8th shawl war this week and I was wondering what sort of tactics would be best? I'm assuming we'll have at least 4 full groups of mid-high 50's and possibly a few lvl 65 folks.<br />
<br />
Any information from folks that have done this war would be greatly appreciated.   Mostly what i know none of the attackers can be snared, rooted, mezzed, they hit roughly in the 150-200 range and any AOE (good or bad) will aggro the general. <br />
<br />
Can the general be mezzed and memblurred for me downtime between attacks? <br />
<br />
How well can the general last if we have problems getting stuff off him?<br />
<br />
Again any info avaliable will be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>grobsmashprexus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It has been awhile so my memory might not be 100% on this.<br />
The general can not be mezzed but can be memblurred.  You can charm him but you can not heal him or cast regen on him.  If you have some one tank him for some down time make sure they click off there DS and they might want to bag there weapons to keep from dmg'ing him alot from reposte.<br />
<br />
Use caution if you use any illusions because some will drop your faction and can make you kos.<br />
<br />
You will want to keep your group close to the general if you do not know where he is heading.  <br />
<br />
I would suggest putting your best tank on the named giants just because they hit the hardest.<br />
<br />
If the fight starts to turn bad just kite the mobs for awhile just becarefull that the general doesnt get killed.<br />
<br />
Becareful about membluring the general during any fight he tends to think all the giants are dead and roams off to the next fight.<br />
<br />
He moves slow just wait on him agroing him and training him to the next fight confuses him.<br />
<br />
Some times the general gets a little lost going to the gnome camp but normaly he will eventually make it.  We had him take 2 hours to make it there one time the person got lucky that they decided to wait at the camp for there /petition to be answered.<br />
<br />
The biggest thing is do not lose the fight it would really suck if that person had to do the 8th shawl tradeskill parts over again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Silkarn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You all will be fine, here are some pointers though,<br />
<br />
1. If someone is KOS to dorfs they NEED to stay FAR away from the general. Not that he will kill them, its simply a PITA to loose aggro then get him pathing again.<br />
<br />
2. Nothing in Iceclad that is &quot;normally&quot; there can/will kill the general. The quest mobs can, but it takes a few minuets so you will have time to peel off of him.<br />
<br />
3. The easy way to prevent dorf aggro and make this go fast, find the spawn points ( I am to lazy to look them up, but Allkhazam should have them). Send 2-3 people with the general, have th erest run to the spawn points, kill all the crap there, as the general is walking up, then head to the next spawn.<br />
<br />
4. watch for KSers</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dubb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">maps.eq-toolbox.com has a downloadable iceclad map with all the 8th shawl stops labelled</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Balfamor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Should be a snap with four full groups of peeps.  The wolves can be mezzed if necessary, but not the giants (I think there is two ambushes with wolves and three with giants).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>elfdragon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">This may seem like a given, but often happens, if you have any warriors with AE taunt, tell them NOT to use it, since it will aggro the dwarf too.  Best bet is to have someone with atone or a spell like it up in case someone aggros the dwarf, cause it seems someone always does... the other option if someone aggros the dwarf is to duel the person who got aggro and kill them (have them click all the buffs off, makes it quicker).<br />
<br />
If the dwarf needs to be atoned/memblurred you can root him before atoning if you need time to kill the spawns without him wandering off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Daggorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks much for the info all, Gonna give this a try friday.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>aspit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thanks much for the info all, Gonna give this a try friday.<br />
<br />
Use a monk or sk to aggro the named then fd when you are ready to move.  The only problem is that he has very very few hps, and mobs attack him if you dont aggro them fast enough.  If the npc dies you lose.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Daggorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Did this successfully on friday.<br />
<br />
Had rought 20ish people 50-57 with a couple in the 40's. had 4 tanking teams set up and a group just for kiting when one needed to be distracted and on the last 2 waves where more than 4 spawned.<br />
<br />
Only had a couple of deaths on the first wave but once folks saw the attack plan in action the rest of the waves went flawlessly.<br />
<br />
The help was much appreciated folks, thankya.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>NhuakofBrell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Did this about a  month ago with 5  65  toons.   Ranger , Cleric, shaman, bard, Druid.    Used   bardto  kite all but 1  mob  ranger  tanked, Bard swarm kited the  giants  while we  were  killing the  rest  was  hilarious.    Won with no  deaths !   Grats to my  65  shammy on his new shawl.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Daggorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Oh, forgot to mention.  Root/snare did not seem to stick to the dwarf.<br />
<br />
I ended up bagging my weapons(no riposte) and aggroing him with a kick in the rear. He doesn't hit for much so usually a single heal over time on me was enough while everyone medded back mana.<br />
<br />
Once done our chanter would memblur and we were off on our merry way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">We got hosed on this one this weekend.<br />
<br />
We started out and immediately the general did that damned DX9 shuffle up and down the slope. We all stood there watching him walk up the slope, disappear, then reappear at the bottom, start up, disappear, reappear at bottom, etc. This went on for a good 45 seconds to a minute, after which he just disappeared entirely.<br />
<br />
What we didn't realize is that we were watching one of the wonderful ghost images. The actual general warped off to the first encounter spot and got chewed up by the wolves while we were being entertained by a graphic bug.<br />
<br />
Our guild mate whose shawl we were trying to get got to use the new Customer Service interface. He said that the interface was very helpful. Now we get to wait a week to hear back from a GM.<br />
<br />
Whee. Just farkin' whee.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Rahge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">DELETED oops double post</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Rahge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Thanks much for the info all, Gonna give this a try friday.<br />

Best thing to do is find a FDer Monk of SK necro in a pinch. He follows the general when the general reaches a spwan point that FDer gains his agroo then kits him away from the mobs .....enroute to fights or at fight period. this wa you gain some control over what and were the General Paths.<br />
<br />
This is the best way to make sure your General isnt killed. Btw you cant Agrro him and run him to the battle points quicker for some reason it doesnt work. Memblur does work.<br />
<br />
As Far as warping from the stone shoreline that he does do and the only way we got around it was to send everyone to the first spawn, and the FD was called to that point if the raid leader spotted said general at the wolves while the FDer watched him climb the hill for the seventh time.<br />
<br />
On agro playing a SK 65 I had to give Gen a beat down to 75% at times to get him to quit trying to run to mobs that appear. even then after 20 or so sec of kiting he would change his mind and jump into the fray. I ahve seen a guild monk master kiting the General but alas he ahs left EQ for its Bu@#$#%^&amp; and is no longer in tough with us :(. ( Yes Aratussi you will be missed)<br />
<br />
We usually assign a MT for named Giants, 2 kiters to run adds around that the other mellee do not tie up and the FDer. The raid leader just sits backs and leads or assist the fray if something goes drastically wrong. Make sure our bards dont AOE the general will agro them after hes done with and of the shawl mobs.<br />
<br />
MT and 2 kiters moves to first spawn with his group<br />
Turn in group has FDer and RL<br />
Melle pace just ahead of Gen to kill and greenies in the way<br />
<br />
Spawn, FD gans the generals attention and kites him away from mobs.<br />
MT engages and Melles grab the attention of what they can along with Kiters running around what mobs they get the attention of.<br />
<br />
RL calls for all mobs dead?<br />
MT and kiters check in<br />
RL calls for FDer to release the general.<br />
<br />
rinse and repeat for all spawns<br />
<br />
As a side note the General can disappear and warp when he goes from the Bridge island to ToFS island and from ToFS island to Gnome island. Obviously the latter just requires patience for him to appear at the gnome camp and cause the Avatar to spawn. The former can be a pain due to all of the whirling snow dervishes although they are grenn 3 or 4 of them can cause the genral a problem.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. This system to date has netted us a 8th Shawl everytime!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Azaza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Wolf form is kos to the General.<br />
<br />
No AE spells. Btw, I did the AE taunt thing once, silly me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">We finished this last night with one glitch.<br />
<br />
After the last fight, the general got stuck in the hill while coming up from swimming across the river. We had him on track, but couldn't target him. Finally, we cast an AE spell on him to aggro him out of the ground, then mem-blurred him. Once free from being stuck, he finished up the rest of the script.<br />
