Considering I have seen a screen shot of Dire with 10k AC it might be a vaible strat--at least for the allinace. I can't see many Horde groups/raids having enough healing to let a druid tank.</div></div><hr />

Can do it in a pinch, but it's not something you really want the druids to do.</div></div><hr />

With the new Armor modifier for Dire Bears, they now have the necessary AC to do it.  They're firmly set in third place in tanking, behind Paladins and Warriors, though they should be still ahead of Shaman.  Right now they have some of the same Rage generation issues Warriors have, but the fix to Warriors should be affecting them as well.<br />
<br />
Druids can definitely off-tank if needed, but if you're considering to have her be able to offtank, then I really recommend making sure she isn't the only healer in the group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vigdis SangCaru</div><div class="date">02-08-2005, 12:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I play a druid and I'd say that druids probably shouldn't be the tank in high end instances.  If I have to off-tank I can (although its super difficult in my groups since I'm also the healer, heh), but I take a shit load more damage than the pally main tank.  At this point my armor is a solid 1500AC behind and we don't get the block advantage that most main tanks use.  <br />
<br />
I should mention that I basically refuse to carry around three sets of armor, which I hear is recommended for druids who shift.  I suspect with a Sta/Str set my tanking abilities would increase somewhat.  But I'd probably still take around twice as much damage - which is what I see happening right now, and then some. <br />
<br />
This wasn't necessarily meant to be a doom and gloom response moaning about how druids suck.  I love my druid and am proud that she can keep up the tank in difficult instances at below-optimum-level when other groups would refuse to take her because she's not a priest.  I dig bear form for when I get aggro from healing.  But at least in my experience even with the dire bear change a shifted druid is too much of a mana sponge to be a viable tank.</div></div><hr />

Definitely wouldn't want her to be THE tank in instances, was just really wondering if they could hold their own offtanking, say, one thing.  Priest friend is always in the group, so the main healer thing is not really a factor for me.<br />
<br />
Next time I hit BRD or whatever, I'll throw the bear to the wolves and just see what happens I guess :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbanz</div><div class="date">02-08-2005, 04:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Druids make solid tanks if they have a healer. As a short story. I was hunting feral yetis in Feralas for a quest with a 41 druid friend, (I was 40 at the time). He has about 500 armor more than me with a shield in dire bear form, and well over a thousand hp more.  We got jumped by a 44 and a 46 yeti. With me healing, he was able to tank them both down and win. He wasnt taking massive damage either, I had more than enough time to regen mana in between heals. So he was able to tank both an oj and a red to him and slowly whittle down their hp, (I wasnt even bothering to attack, I was doing like 1-7 damage a hit lol.) and with no problems at all. He was able to hold agro very well with his bear abilities, I only got agro off the first heal but he got it back fast. I wouldnt want to depend on one to be an elite tank in an instance with yellow+ mobs, but as an offtank they are DEFINATELY better at survivng than a shaman. I may be able to hold agro on a yellow/oj mob better if I want, but only one, and ill take a beating if I try, even though im full enhance specced, (full shield, and parry talents.)</div></div><hr />

Being better than a shaman isn't the bar for instance tanking.  I suspect that with a priest healing a druid could offtank in an instance for a short period of time (hell, in my groups, with me healing, we have the hunters offtank when necessary).  But I'm not sure why they should need to.  Both warriors and paladins ought to be able to control multiple mobs and they'd also be better at taking the hits and it would be more mana efficient to throw heals on one tank as opposed to on two.  The only question would be the ability to keep the tank up with several mobs hitting him without getting aggro.  <br />
<br />
I'm only 50 and haven't yet done anything in BRD, BRS, Scholo (probably missing a couple).  ZF us the toughest instance I've completed and I ran through it at 46 and 47 (the desolace one was generally much easier, although I considered Princess harder than the ZF named) - I could offtank the mobs in both areas but I took significantly more damage than the tanks.  If a healer had to keep me and the main tank up for extended periods offtanking they would have run out of mana quickly.   Again, for short periods of time, yes, a druid can take hits in an instance.  But for short periods of time so can a hunter and a rogue so I'm not sure that's saying much.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Doh, I was unclear.  I have only the one set of armor that I wear - like every other class, I think.  I thought the entire concept of having to lug around other sets of armor to make myself efficient as a shapeshifter was completely half-assed and bogus.  There should be a way to scale our forms so that they work logically, are useful, and not be overpowering.  I am happy with my class as limited purely to caster form - but I'm always the main healer in my groups anyway so thus far I haven't needed to be more well-rounded.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In my experience, druids can take more damage than warlock pets; in terms of hunter pets, it depends on the pet used.   As for aggro management, druid is superior.</div></div><hr />
