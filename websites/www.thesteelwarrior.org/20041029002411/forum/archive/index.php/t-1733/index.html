<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>nyyhte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">If a frost giant and a zelnik both con dk blue to me do they both give the same amount of experience?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Timmok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No, depends on their level.<br />
<br />
And mobs within 5 levels of your level(if you are 51+ I think) gives a fairly substantial amount of extra exp because of the &quot;risk&quot; involved. <br />
<br />
So if you are level 65 and kill a lvl 60 mob, you will get alot more exp than if you killed a level 59 mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>QuirtEvans</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It also depends on &quot;where&quot; the mobs are.  Different zones have different experience modifiers, so it isn't just about the mob's level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Calinthalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I dunno if they ever removed this, but Verant originaly set it up this way......if the mob gives good loot, then it sucks for xp, and the opposite held true as well.  Even when Giants in Kael were yellow to me I got better xp in CC killing blues.  And I'm talking about xp per kill not the fact that you can mow down blues quicker.  It was the same before Velious when the giants in RM gave crappy XP but would really dump out the money.  Giants have traditionally been crappy xp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Taminy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've noticed that killing a mob 5 levels lower than you gives exactly (or close enough to it) 2x the experience that a mob 6 levels lower than you gives (assuming they are in the same zone - there are definetly some substantial differences between most PoP and most non-PoP experience bonuses). <br />
<br />
When PoP first came out, I spent a lot of time doing Seb Juggs with my 2 boxed shaman and a monk friend. Most Juggs are level 57 and the experience was comparable to PoP at 61 and 62 (the non-crowding factor definetly helped too), but as soon as I turned 63 the experience was reduced a ton. <br />
<br />
Afterwards we mostly moved to the larvae in PoV, most of which are level 59. The same thing happened; good experience at 63 and 64, but a huge drop off at 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The amount of exp a mob gives is not magic, there is a specific formula that determines the numeric value a given mob will yeild. The simplified version of the formula (before all the exp changes) is -<br />
<br />
(Level x level x ZEM) / # of people in group = total exp per person<br />
<br />
Where ZEM = Zone experience modifier. The ZEM is a value given to every zone in the game. It can range from 75 for most outdoor zones, all the way up to 119 for most PoP zones and 160 for some n00bie zones.<br />
<br />
Since the changes have been made there are a couple of bonuses that also get figured in to the total amount of exp you get. Now there are bonuses you get as the mob level increases relative to your level. The bonus increases as the mob gets higher with a peak at 3+ levels higher than you.<br />
<br />
Also, there are the group bonuses to consider. The more people in your group, the larget the bonus. Currently, a full group gives an 80% bonus over baseline, and moreimportantly, the exp per person is figured by dividing total exp by 5 instead of 6. This means that adding a 6th person to your group results in a huge gain due to the bump in bonus while the divisor stays the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Taminy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yep - that's why a good strategy from 20s all the way up to low 50s can be hunting in some newbie zones with higher level mobs  in them so you get the big newbie ZEM.</div></div><hr />
