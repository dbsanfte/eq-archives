<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raaj</div><div class="date">01-05-2004, 08:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As some of you know, lately I've been contacted by two different companies interested in purchasing or forming a partnership with The Steel Warrior. Both routes involve an advertisement for the company (Mysupersales or IGE).<br />
<br />
I don't think the advertisements are that intrusive. No popups, no flashing &quot;shoot the monkey&quot;, etc.<br />
<br />
The other aspects of the site wouldn't be changed at all. The moderators remain the same, and the boards would more or less remain untouched. However, there would be one banner advertisement at the top of each &quot;static&quot; page on the site. The advertisement can be found on eqdruids or eqbeastlord.<br />
<br />
The amount of money currently being offered by each company isn't insignificant. I'll be honest - it's really not bad at all. However, I don't want to kill this community for cash. I want to see your thoughts on the issue. The Druid and Beastlord communities exploded when their site was sold - mostly because their administrators handled it a bit differently. In all honesty, you could avoid the advertisements by bookmarking just the forums and reading them instead of the content pages (which aren't finished yet as it is). You'd notice no changes if all you read is the forums.<br />
<br />
The benefits for us would be the stability of their server, and never having the need to get donations from the community again. Along with that would be increased traffic, and we would maintain complete control of everything, minus the small advertisement on the static pages. Your emails will not be spammed, nor will this forum be censored to either companies interests.<br />
<br />
I'm not making a decision right now, I want to know what you think about all of this.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

Do mark my words as I will not say and not do.  Just waiting a tiny bit longer to get caught up from the holidays.  Please warriors lets not let this happen and support our own community.  And yes I have not donated yet but will probably in a couple of weeks when I get my paycheck.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I assume that this would mean that the buyer becomes the owner of the the name &quot;the steel warrior&quot; and the logo?  Frankly, we don't even have permission to use those names from the person who started this site.  For Raaj to accept a big check for a board that was started by someone else and is now being used without their permission might be considered unethical or even illegal.  <br />
<br />
I'd have to say I don't like this at all, but if somebody was waving several thousand dollars in front of my nose, I can't say I wouldn't be tempted to take it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lovingeq</div><div class="date">01-06-2004, 12:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am no fan of Yantis or IGE and if you post any kind of sell platinum banners I would leave this site.<br />
Since there is already plenty of Yantis bashing going around how about some truth about who IGE really is.<br />
<br />
Here are something you should consider about IGE before making such an important decision.<br />
<br />
Not only are the people that run the company indicted and charged as child molesters but they also use IGE as a front to launder money the ripped off from DEN investors.<br />
Before doing any business with them I urge you to atleast research the truth as they are actively being investigated.<br />
<br />
Its really very easy for them to launder the millions they ripped off from the DEN deal. They buy platinum from players of the online game EverQuest with<br />
thier international paypal account then sell it via a US paypal account to bring the money back into the US.<br />
<br />
So if you accept thier laundered money you could get into real trouble.<br />
<br />
Thats not the worst part what is the worst part is that these guys are child molestors.<br />
<br />
The CEO and Co-Founder of IGE is Brock Pearce.<br />
<br />
Go back to last year. IGE was in spain but moved to hong kong. That was after the arrest last year in spain. Now we know why they left spain and why!!!<br />
<br />
http://www.itweek.co.uk/News/1135847<br />
&quot;DEN co-founders Marc Collins-Rector, Chad Shackley and Brock Pearce were arrested in June on an international warrant after being indicted in New Jersey on five counts of transporting a minor across state lines for the purpose of engaging in sexual acts.<br />
The men fled to Spain where they were arrested by Spanish police who found &quot;ENORMOUS AMOUNTS OF CHILD PORN&quot; at their villa.<br />
<br />
I had to read that line again: They found ENORMOUS AMOUNTS OF CHILD PORN!!<br />
<br />
If he wasn't a pedophile then why is he listed on the internets premier ped site.<br />
http://theoffender.net/thisday/ph.cgi?action=1114<br />
A quote from there &quot;In June 2002 he, along with two partners, was arrested in Spain when they were found to have a huge amount of child porn. The trio have been sued in the US for allegedly drugging, raping and threatening to kill teenage boys. &quot;<br />
<br />
Here a 13 YEAR OLD KID is coming forward against them:<br />
http://www.zdnet.com.au/newstech/enterprise/story/0,2000048640,20106761-1,00.htm<br />
Daniel's complaint says that Collins-Rector hired private jets and took Daniel and Shackley to Puerto Rico, Florida, Hawaii, Las Vegas, and New York. Other young boys allegedly filled the hotel suites that Collins-Rector rented. The complaint also charges that limos were sent to Daniel's home to fetch him to Encino, where Collins-Rector encouraged him to spend all of his Friday nights, and that for about a year Collins-Rector and Shackley &quot;engaged in various forms of sexual abuse on plaintiff, including fellatio and sodomy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Daniel says that after he eventually had sex with Collins-Rector, he was passed along to Shackley. The two bought him Versace suits on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills; they made cars available to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;This kid isn't even gay,&quot; Brandt says. &quot;I don't know if he'd even kissed a girl before he met these people. He didn't want this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Here are some articles about this for your enjoyment.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renix</div><div class="date">01-06-2004, 01:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It took forever to get anyone from SoE to even come here and post things like 'we're working on it', and even longer for them to finally start talking to us as a whole and asking for feedback on recent patches.<br />
<br />
Letting Yantis/IGE 'own' the site would kill off any connection we had with SoE, and effectively anything we have to say about anything would yet again be ignored, unless it was via /feedback or /bug ingame, and those tools seem to be ignored by SoE.<br />
<br />
Not to mention what was posted earlier about IGE, and then that you'd be making money off of a name and logo that not only you do not own, but have no permission from the original owner to use. If he were to come around, it wouldn't be hard at all for him to take legal action of some sort.<br />
<br />
If it comes down to it, I'd rather be required to donate something to use the forums than you giving it away to someone else and killing off any hope we had of ever being fixed. If SoE can't get feedback from an entire community at once, they're just that much more likely to simply add something in, whether we like it or not, and leave it broken/useless.</div></div><hr />

Banner ads are one thing, but it doesn't get much worse then IGE or Yantis in my opinion. I hate plat/account/item sellers, the commercial powerlevelers, and the people that support them. It's despicable and it spoils the game on many levels. I understand the benefits that would come of this, but there are underlying principles at stake here.&lt;/opinion&gt;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">01-06-2004, 04:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">First up ... I don't like this idea. I would not want to see it happen. Mysupersales is already saturating just about every other damn site I surf. I don't want it on this site.<br />
<br />
But, to address some of the things being said ...<br />
<br />
Primarily this:<br />
<br />
&quot;My only concern is once Yantis' ads in any shape or form come up here; all dealings with SoE positive and/or negative are gone.&quot;<br />
<br />
That's not true. The Developers visited Monkly Business at the exact same time they visited here. Khavok and Rytan. And MB's history with the Yantis sponsorship is now infamous.<br />
<br />
The ad would not kill the dialog between the class and the developers. It would not ruin the relationship with anyone at SOE, except ONE person:<br />
<br />
Absor.<br />
<br />
He's the only one who stated he would have nothing to do with sites sponsored by Yantis.<br />
<br />
Well ... couple of things about Absor ...<br />
<br />
1- He doesn't do that job anymore.<br />
<br />
2- He never much visited MB BEFORE the sponsorship. And never visited TSW much at all.<br />
<br />
So, while I wouldn't want to see TSW take the same route the beastlord site and the druid site are currently taking ... I would like to assuage your fears that it would negatively impact the relationship with Sony.<br />
<br />
The developers have an agenda (the melee changes) and so, they don't care about pop up or banner ads. They're ONLY talking to melees (both monks AND warriors) because their work REQUIRES it right now.<br />
<br />
That's it. The bottom line.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Also ... another interesting tidbit to keep in mind ... Scott Hartsman posted on Monkly Biz after the Yantis sponsorship ... and after Absor's comments about how Absor wouldn't post there. Seriously ... the only person drumming up that whole platform was Absor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Although my main is not a warrior, I find TSW to be a valuable resource in things EQ-related.  To allow Yantis to take ownership would support his cause of making money at the expense of others and screwing up server economies.<br />
<br />
Yeah, I know he's not the only one to blame, but we gotta start somewhere.<br />
<br />
Have some consideration, please.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baadan</div><div class="date">01-06-2004, 12:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not sure how I feel.. Yantis is very forgiving imo in the way he provides for his sites. He puts one tiny banner on the main page (which I don't even use) and that's it. Then he starts throwing money around. That's a good thing.<br />
<br />
However, the negatives are twofold, as has been said, most likely any SoE presence will be wiped out and secondly, we'd become another board hosted by Yantis and lose some of our integrity. What kind of Warrior gives up and takes the easiest way out?<br />
<br />
Btw, Yantis got the Necro Boards. http://necro.eqclasses.com/forum/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=24015</div></div><hr />

<br />
If they'd be owning the site I'd really be against it. You folks running things here do a kickass job and I'd hate to see anything change.<br />
<br />
If it's just an ad, with no popup or spanking monkeys it shouldn't be a big deal. i've never bought anything from Yantis and never will but if he wants to throw money at TSW it's fine with me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylethe</div><div class="date">01-06-2004, 12:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Business is business...<br />
<br />
That being said it comes down to a question of &quot;creative/content control.&quot; <br />
<br />
1. If this is merely a matter of Yantis/IGE paying a monthly advertising fee in return for banner space, that is one issue - one which I really see no problem with. <br />
<br />
2. If, instead, it is a question of that fee being, in actuality, a purchase agreement - that is another issue which I would be greatly opposed to.<br />
<br />
While my post number or registration date might not indicate it, I have been perusing this board for its information and entertainment value for quite a while now and have found it to be valuable for both. A problem with that value (as currently provided) to the community could arise if control (read creative/content or hosting/physical security) passes with option #2 above.<br />
<br />
I guess, in summation: advertising dollars = good / site sale = bad.<br />
<br />
P.S. I run a newspaper group in SoCal - including related websites. If any assistance is needed re: advertising contract issues and protections / or even general related questions, feel free to contact me at: editor@eaglenewsca.com and I will atttempt to provide any assistance needed.</div></div><hr />

If that is true I'd ask you not to do this.  I would donate $2 monthly to keep this site operational as is.<br />
<br />
If that quote isn't true I have no issues with a legal business advertising in an unobtrusive way in order to support the costs of a great informational site about a computer game.<br />
<br />
I am sure the product developers will go to the sites that have the target market segment they want to appease.  You people are silly thinking it would be any other way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zanakus</div><div class="date">01-06-2004, 01:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yantis is truly a despicable person. He makes all of his real-life money by using hacks to powerlevel characters and generate platinum (this is in direct conflict with Everquest's User Agreement). This causes the honest, hard-working players like us to suffer by having to pay enormous amounts of platinum for formerly cheap items - the rapidly expanding pool of platinum, caused largely by Yantis, makes everything expensive. To accomodate Yantis would:<br />
<br />
- Kill off our relations with SoE, something this board has worked so hard to acquire.<br />
<br />
- Sponsor a known criminal, not only in the EQ world but in Real-Life (it's been proven he gives out your credit card info to random people).<br />
<br />
- Support the killing of Everquest's economy.<br />
<br />
- Drive off many warriors, disgusted by the above, from this site (myself included) and shrink our community.<br />
<br />
 I, for one, will pack my bags and head over to the &quot;dead&quot; Everlore warrior boards before posting on a board affiliated with Yantis. And IGE is far, far worse, being a company of known rapists actively prosecuted by our government. <br />
<br />
 You have to look at the underlying lack of morality that such a decision would provide. Why is Nike such an infamous company? Well, it certainly rakes in the green, but it employs young children under inhumane conditions. Our situation is similar: Morality or Expenses? <br />
<br />
 As Baadan said, a real warrior never takes the easy way out. Just as we get badly mauled facing the baddies of Norrath, you're getting badly mauled financially by facing the costs of this site. But deal with it. Put on your &quot;defensive&quot; discipline, and start nabbing small amounts of cash from us if you need to - it's not fun to pay, but it's the lesser of our two evils.</div></div><hr />

He buys/farms and resells the items. He doesn't use hacks, he doesnt sell your email addresses to outside companies or spam you himself.<br />
<br />
As Iskandar said, developer relations wouldn't be changed at all.<br />
<br />
The forums would not be touched. No censorship, no change in moderation, no advertisements.<br />
<br />
We wouldn't need anymore donations in exchange for a banner ad on the other pages (ie: Armor, Weaponry, Trainin', Questin, Links).<br />
<br />
The only negative is the community outcry that I can see. I've read the druid and beastlord sites. Theirs were handled badly. I want this out in the open so you guys know what COULD happen and if it ever did it wouldn't be a huge surprise out of nowhere.<br />
<br />
Would you continue to use the site should it be changed over? Why or why not?</div></div><hr />

I will say however that there is enough fucking pointless whining on this forum (cough close the warroom now cough), and I dont' wanna be reading all the goddamned Yantis threads that will pop up right after he takes over, ala monkly business, so no, I probably won't be as active even if I do stick around if he takes over.<br />

one of my pet peeves is the person that buys thier char, lvl 65, all kinds of gear, aa's and then does not have clue one as to how to play.<br />

i have already removed the yantis sponsored sites from my guilds link's page.  yes, the information there might be valid and usefull, however those sponsoring it i do not agree with.<br />

so again, it is a matter of pride, i do not want to answer the question, &quot;how did you get XXXXX item?&quot; with &quot;i went and bought some pp and went to the bazaar&quot; or &quot;it came with the character&quot;<br />

I'd gladly through down done $$...hell I give NY transit 300+$ a month and i hate them.<br />

To answer the original question:  I'd support a sponsor only if there is no other way...based on what i read on the links I'm a little concerned regarding what kind of board would survive (I am a die hard no e-bay, no 2 box, old EQ purist)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Yes I'll still use the site.<br />
<br />
Why? Because the site won't change. The info will still be valid. And for the most part, the same people will still be here lurking, posting, flaming, making jokes, whatever.<br />
<br />
As with each site that Yantis has advertised on, there'll be much ballyhooing and blustering when it happens. And months later, it'll die down to just the occasional flame here and there.<br />
<br />
The only reason I don't want the ad there is I've reached my saturation point with supersales.com. Their ads are on almost every site I surf now. I'm getting tired of seeing it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Since the buying and selling of accounts is cheating ... and the buying and selling of in-game items for real life cash is cheating ... why are you surprised he'd use tradeskill macros to manufacture cash?<br />
<br />
From top to bottom the entire operation violates the EULA. None of it is any more &quot;worse&quot; than the other parts of the whole you know what I mean? It's like saying &quot;Oh this smuggler is super bad because he also launders money!&quot; He's a SMUGGLER! He's already bad!<br />
<br />
Heh. Yantis violates the EULA by doing what he does. So yeah, odds are some of the ways he keeps his business running ALSO violate the EULA.<br />
<br />
And it was his site that offered the PL'd to 65 with 300 AAs in 24 hours service. That was obviously using an exploit to achieve that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's running $75 a month right now and it's currently covered 100% by donations.<br />
<br />
2. How much do we need to avoid issues?<br />
<br />
Not sure what you mean by 'avoid issues'.  <br />
<br />
3. If we are currently in the red how much?<br />
<br />
We are currently in the black.  We were about to go negative, but there has been a decent influx of donations in the last month or so.  The numbers are here:<br />
<br />
http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/paypal.php<br />
<br />
4. Do the MODs really want the TSW users to cover the costs (if so say it directly)?<br />
<br />
This isn't really a matter of what the Mods want.  What Yantis is offering is to write a pretty fat check to Raaj to &quot;buy&quot; the board from him, and a monthy check to maintain and moderate it.  This is the benefit to Raaj personally.  The benefit to the rest of us would be that we won't need any donations to take care of monthly bandwidth costs.  We haven't had any problems covering the costs since the move and I am perfectly happy with the donation model.  The money has shown up and we haven't had to beg or anything at all.  <br />
<br />
I've put in my 2 cents on the topic.  I am happy with the current situation and wouldn't consider a Yantis buy-out an improvement.  It really comes down to Raaj though, he's the one that has to say no to the nice payday if he doesn't sell out to Yantis.</div></div><hr />

<br />
-edit- for a more rational response that doesn't bring up the fact that Yantis molests domestic animals, I feel that I should add that whatever this dogscrewer says before he buys a site is probably null and void once he owns it.  I have serious doubts that a gerbil-addict like Yantis would have any shred of decency that would prevent him from dictating changes once the site is his.</div></div><hr />

Btw why is it Raaj that potentially would be cashing in on this?<br />
<br />
I was under the impression that it was someone else that stepped up and gave us this new site when the ezboard was dying(sorry my memory is fuzzy and I forgot his name, maybe someone can remember). If anyone deserves any &quot;payment&quot; it would be him. Not that I think anyone really deserves any special &quot;credit&quot; for TSW. Its value is pretty much the forum, and the posts generated by us users. The main site is kinda irrelevant and un-needed.<br />
<br />
So no offense just find it amusing you can collect money for doing basically what it seems the other moderators have been doing.<br />
<br />
Anyway I dont really care one way or the other. With all the other forums bought up, its just a question of time before someone comes along with a big enough money bag that someone cant resist.</div></div><hr />

I've been reading TSW since I started playing EQ.  I've read all variations of TSW.  I've seen the &quot;mysupersales&quot; web-sites.  I am 100% disgusted with Yantis and others that do business the way he does.  As a poster quite a few pages before me mentioned, &quot;he was proud of his gear that he earned&quot; and whatnot, and this is how I feel about TSW.  WE as a community have earned our spot in the EverQuest message board community.  WE have earned the respect of 100's of warriors that play Everquest.  WE have earned the respect and gratitude and sometimes even a little bit of grief from Sony itself.  Now some low-life scum-bag (I'm being nice atm) wants to just straight up buy our site and reap the benefits of having 100's of hits a day and people glancing at his link with the hopes that someone will click it and he will make a sale.  No...no, not no...nah...HELL NO on this.<br />
<br />
As I mentioned, I've been reading all variations of TSW since I started playing EQ.  I've learned a great deal from this community along with many other class message boards.  I've also read up on Yantis and dislike, even loathe him.  To be honest with you, I have not yet donated to this site, BUT if you DO NOT SELL OUT to him you can gurantee there will be a larger influx of donations due to the fact that having &quot;his&quot; banner on our site disgusts 99% of us.<br />

I for one would no longer be visiting this site if it was owned or affiliated in anyway by Yantis.  I also understand that he would not be doing anything different to the forums, but the thought of being affiliated with him makes me ill.</div></div><hr />
