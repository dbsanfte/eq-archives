<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gunrack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, I know there was a thread about this but I did post on it and got no responses.  So no choice but to start a new one.  It had been discussed what slot was best for haste back or belt, it was even mentioned there was a neck item from the PoI dragon?  Or something to that effect that was 41%, anyways.  I am in a situation where the only things available to me for haste are Cloak of Flames, Siblisian Berserker Cloak, Spiked Seahorse Belt, Rune Branded Girdle, or Runed Bolster Belt.  <br />
<br />
Seeing as I will probably never own a Helm of RZ the Cowl of Mortality does not matter to me either.  Now, which of those haste items is considered to have a better balance of everything?  I have made simulations of all of these on my Magelo profiles and have come out probably between Cloak of Flames or Spiked Seahorse Belt.  Figured I’d see if anyone else had an opinion on this to help me out with the decision.<br />
<br />
<br />
P.S.  I know there has been mention of a 41% haste item from veksar?  Is that better than any of these options here?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Don't count out the Soulscream Belt too. Very nice for around the waist. <br />
<br />
But CoF is nice also...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">soulscream belt is damn nice; also leaves some pretty heavy Ac or HP items for your back ( heiro, pernicity, loyalist shield...whatever floats yer boat, etc.. )<br />
also for the amount the damn things drop...i'd go with that. it might be your cheapest belt to find.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Venox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you have a CoF on you, equip that and buy a Fierce Heraldic Belt. It's like 22ac and 80hp.</div></div><hr />
