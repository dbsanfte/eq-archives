<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Barelorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The message says it all..thanks for any input:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Daabu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I ran a brief search on Lucy:<br />
<br />
Willsapper (35% for 6.5min)<br />
Truncheon of Doom (50% for 3min18sec)<br />
Vyledorinajirnak the Sea's Justice (20% for 1min)<br />
Wavecrasher (same as Vyledorinajirnak)<br />
Canyoneer Pike (25% for 3min18sec)<br />
<br />
Those are the only warrior-equipable ones that I could come up with, but I'm sure there are others (I did a search for spells that had either &quot;slow&quot; or &quot;yawn&quot;, then cross-referenced items with that spell)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Roughbeard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Trident of the Deep Sea and Club of Slime also have a slight % of slow (10% i think). ToD, Willsapper, or Canyoneer Pike would be the best.. Willsapper even might be easier than trying to buy a ToD as many warriors are as proctective over theirs as I am :p Good Luck<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Daabu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">ToD can be essentially soloed by a 65warrior in EP gear, or duoed by a 65war with a healer/bot/whatever<br />
<br />
Chef area of Sebilis, one of the wings though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">yup its very easy to camp at 65</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Barelorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Is the chef a common mob..and what are it's ph's?<br />
<br />
I know the ToD is not a common drop.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for your input.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Got my ToD for 4k in the bazaar. Seller didn't know it was worth quite a bit more :D<br />
<br />
It drops from Froglok Armsman which is the wing to the left of Chef if you are facing the room Chef spawns in. At 65 anything that doesn't con db will not assist on pulls, so if a lb and db are staning next to each other, pull the db and you will get it single. Have done this camp many times with my cleric once he dinged 43 and I could group with him. Pacify works well, but at the same time nothing hits for more than 150 so I don't have any issues tanking upto 6 frogs at once with a CH occasionally. Somtimes I pull a lot and hit stonewall while my cleric ae's :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've done a couple of 4ish hour sessions camping for a ToD and not seen any named yet :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kogur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ya sure it's still on the loot tables? Coulda sworn it was removed, I've been offered a LOT for my ToD and I won't take any of em.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tanzen Whacksem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Lucky for me, I secured a ToD quite a long time ago from the bazaar.<br />
Only paid 1800pp for it at the time.<br />
<br />
Ranks right up there with my bazaar find of the century == Earthshaker for 250pp<br />

ToD makes for a very effective slowing tool, if no castable slows are around and if you can manage to be a slave to the Random Number Generator.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If a slow is imperative, and you don't have one of the preferred classes for slowing, I bust out /Disc Charge.<br />
<br />
Guaranteed every hit will land and usually that alone makes the ToD Proc. I used it as a last ditch effort when we accidentally got 2 krigers and our chanter bit the dust early. Cleric was low mana and I busted out the ToD, /disc Charge and Voila! Proc and the proc stuck. Problem was we were lacking on the DPS end of that fight, and at 3% I took a dirt nap, but the others there managed to finish it off.  <br />
<br />
ToD is a very useful tool even at 65.</div></div><hr />

Charge does not increase proc rate. PC's can proc on a  miss.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">You can thank the RNG for the procs, not Charge :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Mistikat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Grrr...  So landing every blow does not increase the chance for it to proc? Oh well, bye bye charge disc hotkey.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I use fellstrike over any other offense related disc. It's just too good with a high damage 2hander. Especially when berserk.</div></div><hr />
