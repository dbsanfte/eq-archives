<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>torn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi, I played EQ from when it when live to about 6 months after Kunark came out as a Druid.  Now I've just come back and started playing as a Warrior.   When I played my Druid I seem to recall that Warriors were upset that they didn't have any new skills or abilities to look forward to after level 35.  So Verant implemented a ton of new skills only for the Warrior class.  But now I can't seem to find any reference to these skills online?  What happened to them, or is my memory failing me?<br />

Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Varaho</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">From level 35 till level 52 the only warrior &quot;skill&quot; that is gained is /disc fearless at level 40 irrc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">We also get /disc resistant at 35, rogues get both of these also, and probably monks do to.   And those aren't really skills, they're disciplines(and crappy ones at that)  :) The biggest concern was that from level 40 to level 51, melee classes don't get ANY melee skill increases.  We are capped at 40(41?) and don't get any skill ups until 51.  This was an even greater concern pre-Kunark, when 50 was the maximum level, and casters kept getting spells all the way up to level 50 and melees got 2 things, Jack and Shit....things haven't really changed much in that regard. :D<br />
