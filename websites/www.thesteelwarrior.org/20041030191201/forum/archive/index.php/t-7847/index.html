<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>splatterpunk6</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Trying to decide which is best for my warrior so here's the question:<br />
<br />
Primary:  I'm using Blade of Carnage (soon to have anger augment)<br />
Secondary:  I'm looking at one of the three choices:<br />
<br />
Copper Hammer of Striking (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=22010)<br />
Sword of the Bloodsworn (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=22009)<br />
Velium Gemmed Long Sword (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=26880)<br />
<br />
And I intend on adding an augment to whatever weapon I get for offhand.  If I choose the Velium Gemmed Long Sword I can add both augments.  I'm trying to decide which of these are the best augments to put on the second weapon:<br />
<br />
Radiant Permafrost (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=23663)<br />
Slimestone Fragment of Dread (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=25395)<br />
<br />
The dps and stats are pretty obvious.<br />
<br />
My real question here is which one has the least resisted proc  (already on weapons and augments) in places like PoV/BoT/HoH  (basically the only places I'll have access to for a while).</div></div><hr />

The first two both have a DD+0.0 stun. It doesn't matter if they resist or not, aggro created is the same.  I'd recommend CHoS and also anger III the BoC, don't put two anger IIs out.  You'll keep the BoC around for quite abit longer, and i'd personally recommend not augging the off hand till you find a more permanent one.  If you have a BoC, chance are you can get other decent weapons like GBoS, so wait for those to aug it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>johnyjohnson76</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Best bet is to save up for 2 A3 augs, since they are going to allow people to remove aug's without deleting them there is no reason not to put an A3 in your off hand weapon...<br />
<br />
Personally i'd use the SotBS since the stun works on mobs up to lvl 65</div></div><hr />

No you can't. That weapon has one type 4 and one type 7 augment slot. Proc augments require type 4 slots. That means that you will only be able to put one proc augment on that weapon.<br />
<br />
Buy Anger 3 and put it on your BoC and on either the hammer or sword or the bloodsworn. Both weapons are nearly identical  and as the previous poster said, augments will be reusable meaning you will never waste getting Anger 3.</div></div><hr />
