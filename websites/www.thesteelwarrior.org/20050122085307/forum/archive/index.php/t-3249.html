<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">09-25-2003, 03:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Surprisingly, with the release of LDoN, there appears to be a new choice in BPs for many warriors. Of course there are always the obvious choices, but never before has a top quality BP been available to so many. But, how good is the LDoN BP? Is it worth getting if you are in a raid guild? Here's a quick break down.<br />
<br />
1. Raex's Chestplate of Destruction<br />
AC: 100<br />
Skill Mod: Riposte +8%<br />
STR: +30 DEX: +25 STA: +30 AGI: +25 HP: +250<br />
SV FIRE: +20 SV DISEASE: +20 SV COLD: +20 SV MAGIC: +20 SV POISON: +20<br />
Shielding: 3<br />
Effect: Echo of Anger (Worn)<br />
By far the best BP a warrior can hope for. Best HP/AC, great stats, and an effect that is actually useful. Unfortunately, this is only available to the very elite.<br />
<br />
2. Chestguard of Enchanted Marble<br />
AC: 85<br />
STR: +25 DEX: +20 STA: +20 CHA: +12 WIS: +25 INT: +25 HP: +150 MANA: +150<br />
SV DISEASE: +30 SV POISON: +30<br />
Effect: Vengeance VII (Worn)<br />
Second only to Raex's in HP and AC, also have a nice effect. Augmented can almost have 200 raw HP. DR and PR are nice additions since they are hardest resists to raise. Too many hybrid stats, but I guess you can't have it all. Worst part of this BP is the pain in the ass it is to get. Not many guilds are willing to farm the Rathe encounter.<br />
<br />
3. Great Shadow Platemail<br />
AC: 80<br />
STR: +25 DEX: +25 STA: +25 WIS: +15 INT: +15 AGI: +25 HP: +125 MANA: +125<br />
SV FIRE: +30 SV COLD: +30<br />
Effect: Vengeance X (Worn)<br />
The rarity of this BP is it's biggest drawback. It also has many hours of camping a VT and Emp key as strikes against it. The stats make it very worthwhile with the Vengeance giving it the boost over the LDoN BP.<br />
<br />
4. Royal Attendant Breastplate of Sand (augmented)<br />
AC: 69<br />
STA: +13 WIS: +10 INT: +10 CHA: +11 HP: +180 MANA: +100<br />
SV MAGIC: +12 SV COLD: +12 SV POISON: +12<br />
or<br />
AC: 69<br />
STA: +13 WIS: +10 INT: +10 CHA: +11 HP: +140 MANA: +100<br />
SV MAGIC: +12 SV COLD: +12 SV POISON: +12<br />
Effect: Vengeance III (Worn)<br />
Lack of an effect and the slightly lower AC keeps this from moving up a slot on the list. Still very good stats and unreal HP. Available to anyone with the time to complete around 80 LDoN adventures to purchase the BP and necessary augments. Also, 30hp can be substituted for Vengeance III for those who are light in the worn ATK department, still giving you a 180hp BP with a nice effect. This BP in either form is likely the best BP that the majority of warriors will ever see.<br />
<br />
5. Heavy Yttrium Chestplate<br />
AC: 75<br />
STR: +20 STA: +20 WIS: +20 INT: +20 HP: +125 MANA: +125<br />
SV FIRE: +30 SV DISEASE: +15 SV COLD: +15 SV MAGIC: +15 SV POISON: +30<br />
Effect: Yttric Ventus (Worn)<br />
Excellent BP with very good stats. This BP is also a bit rare and a pain to get access to. HP and Effect are nice, but not quite up to the level of the BPs ahead on the list.<br />
<br />
6. Kizrak's Chestplate of Battle<br />
AC: 63<br />
STR: +10 DEX: +9 STA: +15 AGI: +6 HP: +115<br />
SV DISEASE: +15 SV MAGIC: +10 SV POISON: +15<br />
Effect: Shield of the Arcane (Must Equip, Casting Time: 12.0)<br />
Excellent BP and surprisingly easy to aquire. Mold is tradeable and mob that drops it is up every 6 hours. Good resists and handy effect for the times a shammy is not around. Great all around BP that is available to the masses.<br />
<br />
7. Breastplate of Speed<br />
AC: 60<br />
Skill Mod: Dodge +5%<br />
DEX: +15 STA: +10 WIS: +8 INT: +8 AGI: +15 HP: +125 MANA: +75<br />
Effect: Fury of the Vah Shir (Worn)<br />
Not only is this BP rare, but it lacks resists and the stats leave a little to be desired compare to other BPs. Most people capable of getting one probably are maxed stats anyway, but no resists at all hurt it. Very nice effect because it leaves a lot of options when you don't have to consider where your haste is going to be.<br />
<br />
8. Breastplate of the Void<br />
AC: 65<br />
STR: +25 DEX: +8 STA: +25 WIS: +8 INT: +8 AGI: +8 HP: +110 MANA: +75<br />
SV FIRE: +8 SV DISEASE: +8 SV COLD: +8 SV MAGIC: +8 SV POISON: +8<br />
Required level of 51.<br />
Effect: Heart of the Void (Must Equip, Casting Time: 2.5)<br />
Very similar to Kizrak's with a nice effect and good stats. While pretty rare, this is becoming available to a lot more people as more guilds become Ssra capable. Not much of an option to guilds that have progressed to VT+ due to heavy competition.<br />
<br />
9. Constricting Cuirass<br />
AC: 68<br />
STR: +20 STA: +20 WIS: +15 INT: +15 HP: +125 MANA: +75<br />
SV MAGIC: +15<br />
Recommended level of 63.<br />
Effect: Vengeance II (Worn)<br />
Again, lack of resists and huge pain in the ass to get this BP hurt it as a good option for many warriors. Most guilds capable of killing new Inny haven't bothered. Effect is nice, but not enough to push it up on the list.<br />
<br />
10. Farwater Plate Breastplate<br />
AC: 65<br />
STR: +12 DEX: +10 STA: +8 WIS: +8 INT: +8 HP: +120 MANA: +50<br />
SV DISEASE: +15 SV POISON: +15<br />
Very good stats and tradeable make this a very nice BP. However, farming enough components is a huge strike against this BP. Also, lack of a good effect makes this a stepping stone BP to some any one of the BPs higher on the list.<br />
<br />
Honorable mention:<br />
There are also quite a few BPs that are still very good but not up to par with the above. Some are pretty easy to get - Chestplate of Vindication, Champion's Breastplate, Breastplate of the Myrmidon, and Warlord's Breastplate are all obtainable with small numbers of people and several can be MQ'd. Breastplate of Eradication is also a good option for the non-uber warrior. Each of these is a viable option, just not quite the quality of the higher end BPs.<br />
<br />
** EDIT ** Removed 1 augment from LDon for a more accurate comparison.</div></div><hr />

Remove the 3rd augment from LDoN BP. It gives a totally flawed view.<br />
You cant compare Fully Aug vs Zero Aug. <br />

AC: 69<br />

Vengeance 3 or 8% Dodge or 36% Haste<br />
<br />
<br />
Caus to get the 210hp LDoN u need full augments.<br />
Fully augmented Raex is 290hp and not 250.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kilaara</div><div class="date">09-25-2003, 04:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah augment them all or let it be.<br />
<br />
In the end the Seru BP would have 165 HP that means missing 45 HP is for you more important than the bunch of better stats the seru BP has.<br />
<br />
I cant see the Ldon BP in that place you put it in.<br />
<br />
When you compare it to the Heavy Yttrium you get<br />
<br />

6 AC 7 Sta 10 Wis/Int 25 Mana 20 Str 30 fr 15 dr 3 cr 18 pr 3 mr 4 HPregen  / 15 Atk<br />
<br />
Plus of Ldon<br />
45 HP <br />
<br />
Or with VIII augmented<br />
Plus of 15 hp <br />
<br />
Can't see that this minimum of HP is realy better than the bunch of stats increases of the HY.<br />
<br />
Btw. when youre not maxed in Sta the 7 Sta of the HY match the difference.</div></div><hr />

Why? Because haste in a slot is a necessity, and most haste items are more of a tradeoff in stats than the BPoSpeed is.<br />
<br />
BP of Speed + Comparable gloves &gt; Most haste items + most BPs</div></div><hr />

To give an idea on BP rarety, we got :<br />
<br />
- 6 Great Shadow Platemail / 17 Aten Ha Ra<br />
- 3 Breastplate of Speed / 8 Thall Xundraux Diabo<br />
- 3 Heavy Yttrium Chestplate / 14 Lord Inquisitor Seru<br />
- 1 Breastplate of the Void / 19 Vyzh`dra the Cursed</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">09-25-2003, 06:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The reason I used the fully augmented LDoN BP is because of the easy of aquiring the BP. If you take just the LDoN BP without augments, you could get that in a week pretty easily - only 28 adventures on normal setting. Doing 3 a day you would still get one in under 10 days. When you consider the diffculty in just getting in to the the zones most of the others drop, it's not unreasonable to say you would spend a comparable amount of time as you would getting a fully augmented LDoN BP just to get in to the zones. If you add the 40hp any type augment to any of the other BPs listed below the LDoN BP, you would still end up with less HP and a whole lot more work in getting a key and an augment.<br />
<br />
Nothing even comes close to touching Raex's, augmented or not. I didn't see the need to include the max possible HP on it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Plus of HY<br />
6 AC 7 Sta 10 Wis/Int 25 Mana 20 Str 30 fr 15 dr 3 cr 18 pr 3 mr 4 HPregen / 15 Atk<br />
<br />
Plus of Ldon<br />
45 HP Including all of the stats differences makes the difference look more impressive, but in reality it's mostly fluff. At the level that someone would be considering BPs of this caliber, they would no doubt have maxed STR/STA/DEX/AGI with just a few buffs. The only other relevant stat is CHA for DI and of course resists so the comparison should actually be:<br />
<br />
Plus of HY<br />
6AC 30FR 15DR 3CR 18PR 3MR 4 HPregen / 15 Atk<br />
<br />
Plus of Ldon<br />

<br />
or <br />
<br />

6AC 30FR 15DR 3CR 18PR 3MR 4 HPregen<br />
<br />
Plus of Ldon<br />
55 HP 11CHA<br />
<br />
I wouldn't include the augment on the HY because of the difficulty in getting th HY to begin with. Obviously if you already have one then it would make sense to augment it and work on other items, but if you are looking for an upgrade from a lesser BP you need to take in to consideration getting the BP.<br />
<br />
So an argument can be made that the HY is the better BP for pure stats, however I ranked the LDoN higher because of 2 reasons. First, you have the option to go all out HP with 210 if you are maxed on worn ATK, and second because it is about 10x easier to get than a Seru BP. No bane weapon farming, no annoying quest to get a key, no guild raid, no DKP compared to pick up groups a few times a night for a month. If the HY was easier to get I would have probably swapped the 2, but for many people HY is not even an option.<br />
<br />
VT bps are not that rare.<br />
<br />
To give an idea on BP rarety, we got :<br />
<br />
- 6 Great Shadow Platemail / 17 Aten Ha Ra<br />
- 3 Breastplate of Speed / 8 Thall Xundraux Diabo<br />
- 3 Heavy Yttrium Chestplate / 14 Lord Inquisitor Seru<br />
- 1 Breastplate of the Void / 19 Vyzh`dra the Cursed In order for a VT/Ssra BP to not be that rare, one must first hunt in those zones to begin with. Once you get to elem level, chances are you will never get any of those BPs. Also, while it would seem your guild has had pretty good luck in getting BP drops, I don't think the same could be said for most others. Also, when you figure out the amount of time it takes on average for one of those BPs, it makes LDoN all the more attractive.<br />
<br />
Great Shadow Platemail - 1 every 2.8 weeks<br />
Breastplate of Speed -  1 every 2.6 weeks<br />
Heavy Yttrium Chestplate - 1 every 5.3 weeks<br />
Breastplate of the Void - 1 every 19 weeks<br />
<br />
Coupled with the fact that LDoN is a sure thing and the amount of time you would need to spend farming keys to get in to either Seru or VT and again the LDoN looks a lot nicer to a lot of people.<br />
<br />
With that said, keep in mind that people value stats differently depending on their current situation. I am sure there could be all kinds of arguements made as to the order of these BPs, this is just my personal opinion on the order I would rank them. About the only think most people would agree on is that these are the top 10 and I bet some people would even argue that some of the honorable mention BPs should have been on the list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sangiovese</div><div class="date">09-25-2003, 07:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nice list.  As with any listing, there will be personal preferences that shuffle the order a bit... but overall that looks pretty good.<br />
<br />
I agree that one augment should be removed from the LDoN BP stats for comparison purposes, as all the other BPs also have an augment slot.  (And the ease of acquiring it isn't a factor, because it is just as easy to acquire the augment for any of the other BPs)  <br />
<br />
The first two augments should be included however, because the other BPs do not have those slots available.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kilaara</div><div class="date">09-25-2003, 08:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can make a list ala <br />
<br />
Which BP is the easiest to obtain for that what she will bring.<br />
<br />
Or you can make a list of the best Bps for a Tank.<br />
<br />
When you want to make the last one there is no place for the argument that one is more difficult to obtain than the other.<br />
<br />
Dont bring in apples with oranges.<br />
<br />
When you want that with the easy stuff skipp Raex cause then Raex should be the worst one.<br />
<br />
Btw. nobody today will farm bane weapons for Seru.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cily</div><div class="date">09-25-2003, 10:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;Including all of the stats differences makes the difference look more impressive, but in reality it's mostly fluff.

<br />
I challenge you to design a set of LDoN gear that maxes these sats, but does not sacrifice all the HP to do it.<br />
<br />
The stat boost on LDoN armor is VERY low compared to other high end stuff.<br />
<br />
So maybe the stats and resists do not matter much if you already have access to elemental and time gear, but for warriors relying on LDoN, I can assure you there are going to be unmaxed stats.<br />
<br />
This sort of makes this BP better for the uber warrior then the casual one. As a &quot;casual&quot; warrior I will most likely stick with my Kizrak BP for a long, long time and use my points in other areas. On the other hand, a warrior with far better gear might find the trade off for HP worthwhile, since they can max their stats with other gear much easier than myself.<br />

You need 0 bane weapons for Seru. They help, sure, but they aren't necessary. I held Seru just as well with 2 EB weps as with BF/Bane combo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
More useful effect and better resists than AHR BP.<br />
<br />
But you still shouldn't augment the LDoN BP just because it's from LDoN.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, I'm chew some ac for some resists and 10cha, but that's my personal opinion only.  But you can bet your sweet ass I'll take an ATH or Seru bp once it filters down.</div></div><hr />

Otherwise it's not a best list it's a &quot;best...BUT&quot; list. Obviously your real intention was the point out how good the LDoN BP is. After you put 100+ hours into getting/augmenting it anyways. So just go whole hog and shot it fully aug'd again, vs the rest of them with Solid Coal on them. Shouldn't really change the order, but will at least be a more realistic comparison. Anyone with the other BP's can surely do the 20ish adventures to get the coal a lot easier than someone without can do 100+ to aug out the Tak chest.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kilaara</div><div class="date">09-30-2003, 10:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">But its still not better than a seru bp with one 40 hp augment.<br />
<br />
And dont forget the points you have to spend for it you could give in some other 40 hp ... augments for other Items so it is not really so uber cause you spend points for a 40 hp upgrade for a BP which is in the original form not really much better than the eradication or the Vindi BP.<br />
<br />
Maybe in the End when you have augmented all your stuff with best augments it will be nice but until then its better to augment your stuff then to buy that BP.<br />
<br />
Make the startmath. <br />
Eradication = 100 hp<br />
4 augments in 4 armorslots = 160 hP<br />
Total 260 HP<br />
<br />
LdonBP + 3 augments = 210 HP <br />
<br />
When you only look at HP skip the BP take augments.</div></div><hr />
