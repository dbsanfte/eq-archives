<br />
So far I've thought of these two upgrades that'd probably suit me best:<br />
<br />
---------------<br />
a] Stonewood Compound Bow<br />
b] Ornate Gaunts and Ornate Helm (I think I can afford this)<br />
---------------<br />
<br />
a] raw stats: 10ac 15str 10sta 100hp 35svD<br />
what I actually gain: 5ac 15str 2sta 65hp 35svD -15vsvC<br />

b] raw stats: 67ac 10str 16sta 11dex 3agi 120hp 9svF 6svC 4svM 11svP<br />
what I actually gain: 20ac 3str -1sta 4dex 40hp 6svF 6svF 4svM 11svP<br />

HEPL! Input and other suggestions greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kavak</div><div class="date">01-22-2004, 01:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would buy the bow because you can resell it, not to mention you can ldon an equivalent helm/gauntlets.<br />
<br />
Although I know that personally I never make any big purchases before an expansion, because who knows whats in store.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">01-22-2004, 02:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">unless you just cant live with yourself unless you spend that cash .... save it till after the expansion.<br />
<br />
prices will drop a good bit on all existing items, and a whole bunch of new fun toys will be hitting the market.<br />
<br />
if you must spend it, tho, buy the bow for the reasons stated above</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grongl</div><div class="date">01-22-2004, 02:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't buy anything until a week after GoD launch at least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redhenna</div><div class="date">01-22-2004, 03:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would also add that as soon as you buy the gaunts and helm, you will have them drop for you, and at the same time, the price they sell at will drop to next to nothing(at least that is what uaually happens to me).  Raw numberwise, the gaunts/helm is slightly better to my mind, but LDoN helm/gloves can be gotten free with points, but I do not know of a bow that good from LDoN(correct me if that is untrue).  I would get the bow.<br />
<br />
Edit:  but as mentioned above by others, wait if you can till after GoD comes out, as prices on those items will probably drop, and there may be some new, better item that you want from GoD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baadan</div><div class="date">01-22-2004, 03:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good point about the new expansion. I have no problem sitting on my money.<br />
<br />
As far as the 1492 Tak armor or even the 776 EF armor, those are huge point items given my style of play, and I'd be lucky to afford one, much less be able to aug it with anything more than the +6 stat dropped ones and the 150pt 5ac aug from EF.<br />
<br />
Most likely as far as LDoN goes, once I get Anger 2 for my GSoT (may not aug the GSoT.. I'm close to getting a GSo4W, pretty much everyone in my guild has one but me :() I'm going to start buying the 150 pt 5ac augs from EF and placing those on various peices of armor, replacing all other augs except +sta and +hp (if I ever get any of those, never seen one drop)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wompem Ondahed</div><div class="date">01-22-2004, 03:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gaunts are easy drops in the East camp, turst me. I have gotten about 5 for guildies plus a several greed wins for our group. Just stick it. Helm I have never dropped nor camp. I wouldn't mind one but really I want to save for RZ helm or bite the bullet and get one from LDoN. 39ac 75 hp is very solid for a casual player such as myself. <br />
<br />
Also very good points on waiting on the expansion. I am currently banking asll my AA for weapon affinity and flowing endurance aa's.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, I was in the situation and I chose the bow. Hard to beat that many hp in range slot and its droppable in case I somehow get uber and upgrade ( yeah right ) .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dynafrack</div><div class="date">01-23-2004, 03:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">buy the stonewood bow and don't bother with ornate guants unless you're 2 boxing alot and need clicky haste.  HoT gaunts are better IMO.</div></div><hr />

Its overpriced and totally worthless.<br />
10sta 10atk 2regen, are not worth Xkpp over Fire bow.<br />
Air bow are very rare but often underpriced.<br />
<br />
As for the rest,  well wait for GoD to come out.<br />
LDoN hard drops are getting a bit more common on the market.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zynth</div><div class="date">01-23-2004, 08:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i'd get the guantlets first. even after you get a replacement for them you'll still use the clicky. i was lucky enough to find a pair for 24k back when they upped the drop rates on all ornate molds/patterns. best deal i ever got, i use the clicky every time i play. since it the icon stacks with other haste buffs, i can also use it as a junk buff to take the first slot. it's good for when your farming solo, if the chanter/shammy just forgets to re-haste, and the buff last a little over an hour, so your not constantly clicking it. <br />
the bow how ever is also nice, you wont easily find a better range item and as mentioned before, it has resale value once you eventually do find something to replace it. for a warrior, i'd think that a high damage bow would be perfered since most of the time we only use it once or twice when a mob is inc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">01-23-2004, 09:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its overpriced and totally worthless. <br />
<br />
I dunno, hard to beat 10sta 100hp in range.  Even if it is just a 10 sta difference, that means a lot to a lot of people.  The other warrior I group with still needs an elemental bow, and we see obsidianwood's for sale every week and keep passing them up until we got the cash laying around for a stonewood/featherwood.  It's pretty silly not to get the 10 stamina when you can.<br />
<br />
Besides that fact, with a new expansion out, people are going to be farming the elemental planes less.  If anything, the price of the bows are going to go up, not down.  Look what happened when LDoN came out.  There was always elemental bows for sale on CT.  Then everyone stopped XP'ing in Earth and now we've got people trying to sell ANY elemental bow for 150k.<br />
<br />
Worst thing I ever did was not buy 2 stonewoods and 2 featherwoods for resist gear when they were cheap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baadan</div><div class="date">01-23-2004, 11:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Eh.. good point there Haass. Damn why does every point have to have a counterpoint.<br />
<br />
Afaik, Stonewood is actually one of the cheaper elemental bows (right around 100k) on Mith Marr. I'll hold out for now, but if I can get a good deal (under 90k) I'll snag it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dynafrack</div><div class="date">01-23-2004, 02:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Stonewood is FAR from worthless.  I bought mine for 100k on Mith mar.  You should be able to find one no problem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Damn ... Stonewood is usually 30k more expensive than the Fire one on my server.<br />
With Fire beeing by far the cheapest (Fenin Farmfest = lotsa bows).<br />
<br />
10atk 10sta arent worth 30k to my eyes.<br />
<br />
You're probably doing the right thing if its the cheapest.<br />
But i admit its a surprise.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've paid more for less.  Fierce Heraldic -----&gt; Boots of the Storm.<br />
<br />
When you're under the stamina cap, and not in a heavy raiding guild (luclin+), you've gotta do what you've gotta do.  Money comes and goes, get the stats when you can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ThornyEQ</div><div class="date">01-23-2004, 06:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Can't give a &quot;nay&quot; based on price unless you know the prices of these items on other peeps' servers. I bought the Stonewood bow for 70Kpp, and even in today's inflated bazaar economy they rarely go over 90Kpp on The Nameless. The others tend to sell for 50-70Kpp, except for Featherwood, which is rarer and tends to go for 100-110kpp when it's for sale.<br />
<br />
Baadan, I'd suggest getting the Stonewood bow first.</div></div><hr />
