I personnaly still think that in EP Planes , Time  VS most bosses a full hasted tank dual weilding two 20 delay weapons is kinda suicidal ( or wanna prevent the clerics to fall asleep ) <br />
 Anyone been doing , finding some parse for Ripostes issues in GOD yet ??  <br />
I personnally would still use 2handers till i ( hopefully soon ) get a DBoW , some tanks seem to be convinced that ripostes have been nerfed and go full haste with EoE and BF combo for example against time gods ... I d like to find some serious parse about ripostes using various combo ( some recent ones ) and have some opinions about GoD Riposte rates . <br />
Thx in advance</div></div><hr />

<br />
What I have found though is with weapon affinty and dw plus saryn ranged I am able to generate enough aggro on Ikkinz Pixxt mobs to turn off attack at about 70% and leave it off for the rest of the fight.So while the riposte rate may be more or less in GoD then pop,The low HP of mobs combined with the ability to turn off attack that weapon affinty affords gives me the opportunity to aquire more HP and AC from two weapons while also being able to perform my primary role and leaving me immune to riposte for 70% of a fight....</div></div><hr />

I've been MTing alot in time this month, and have never found dual wielding to be the cause of my death, its merely lucky rounds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">02-23-2004, 04:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't know about you but on a Pixtt I want that thing dead as fast as possible, and that means I'll contribute my measly DPS if it helps makes her die a little bit faster.  My group's damage dealers were bard/war(me)/monk/wizard.  Conservatively let's say the damage ratio is 1/1/1.5/3, then me not attacking drops our group's DPS from 6.5 to 5.5, which lengthens the fight by around 16%.  In reality I think I probably do more than the bard and the monk doesn't do 50% more than me (though you never know...) so it's even more than that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Splaktar</div><div class="date">02-27-2004, 10:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ripostes are still just as big of a deal in GoD as they were in elemental planes.  Mobs riposte for 1200+ and fairly frequently.<br />
<br />
That said, I've tried using VDD w/ Ykesha aug to tank in GoD.  But in general I just can't really keep aggro that well.  So I've been forced to use DBotW w/ Anger3 and SoPP/EoE.  Sometimes I try to swap in AoE, because even w/o another weapon, DBotW is insane aggro.  But even then I sometimes loose aggro and need to go back to dual wield.<br />
<br />
I don't have a Raex BP yet, so that might make a big difference.  Shrug.</div></div><hr />
