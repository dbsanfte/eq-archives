<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">hear me out, i was thinking about classic patchs, and how they go in waves, new expantion, half finished, patch to finish it, small bug fixs, new stuff, next expantion hype, rinse repeat.<br />
<br />
since we are already on to the next expantion im thinking that the dev's are holding off on balacing the game simply because... they dont want to do it twice, after the expantion the game could be unbalanced again, and you know that once the last expantion is out, they are gona be doing bug fixes, balancing and then leaving it on auto pilot so they can focus on EQ 2, while i considered boycotting the new expantion, i relised as much as they say they dont like to balance classes with boxed content, that is what they are going to make the balancing centered around, pardon my spelling its 5 in the morning :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">oh and absor you need to check with the dev team, i know you said your company doesnt fix class balance with boxed content but for 10 months now it says on DC that they are changing PoP weapons, that is boxed content isnt it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Itemisation and the environment are a massive part of any new expansion. <br />
<br />
To say balance is not addressed in expansions is to totally ignore the fact that balance cannot help being affected by expansions. <br />
<br />
It's at best a gross simplification, at worst a deliberate dismissal to excuse resolution of a problem. That or they have the cognitive abilities of a slug.</div></div><hr />

It sure would be.  And, well, that's not what I said.<br />
<br />
I said, we don't use expansions as a tool to balance the game.<br />
<br />
Yes, expansions need to be balanced and can affect balance.  But we're not going to launch and expansion with a bullet points that say:<br />
<br />
*  X New Places to explore!<br />
*  Y New NPCs to kill !!<br />
*  Balance your melee character with new skills and new items!<br />
*  Z New Spells!<br />
<br />
A</div></div><hr />

<br />

*six months later* Hey Joe wasnt there something we were suppose to remember? OH Poo, We forgot about Melee Balanceing!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Rylaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I just honestly do not understand why melee receive nothing special in any expansion. <br />
<br />
Every spell casting class gets new spells, and it seems to be a selling point too, how nice! What the hell keeps us playing melee classes when all we can look forward to in each new expansion is... maybe some levels, AAs, the same hp and gear upgrades as everyone else gets... that's it. Oh and LFG. We can sit around LFG! <br />
<br />
I just do not get how melee deserve nothing special when we pay the same amount for the expansion but recieve less for it. Makes no sense! I'm beginning to realize that expansions are like the dreaded all/all item. We'll never receive the same benefits from it that others do. <br />
<br />
*shrug* <br />
<br />
I'm tired of being ignored. I'm special too damnit! <br />
<br />
*pouts*<br />
<br />
You say you don't balance the game inside a box, but melee are being left out of the loop each and every expansion. <br />
<br />
It might be wise for SoE to take a look at this policy and realize that with each and every new expansion where every class but a few receive something new, melee are falling behind them. If you aren't going to balance things with an expansion, at the very least it might be a good idea to anticipate that some balancing will need to be done after an expansion... not a year later! :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Maybe I'm ranting, but to be honest I am just sick of feeling left out. <br />
<br />
I play this game to have fun. <br />
<br />
Being level 65 with 200+ AAs I have some of the best gear in this game (albeit some is knightemized) and I still have trouble finding a group! I was like  level 54 when PoP came out and I struggled my way to the top but it took me a good 4 months to go from level 60 to 65. <br />
<br />
I've seen Knights gain those levels in a week. <br />
<br />
I would have as well, if I could have found groups more easily. <br />
<br />
At some point I just gave up and made a cleric hydra. She's 64 now and I mainly 2 box when I sit LFG for more than 30 minutes.<br />
<br />
When you sit around and feel like the kid who gets picked last in gym class everyday while LFG, well, it gets to you. Most warriors have been feeling this way for a year now, and enough is enough. <br />
<br />
I really don't want to feel left out anymore. <br />
<br />
Do something about it.<br />
<br />
Edit: Absor is right about one thing, spelling is hard!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Doggabone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">arf arf<br />
<br />
What Absor is saying here is that SOE doesn't recognize a class balance issue and create an expansion to fix it, or withhold a fix for the next expansion.  Balance is a by-product of boxed content, not a feature.  You can see this reading past patch messages.  After all, while some developers are working on content others are working on class issues, and while there will be cross-over there will not always be synchronicity.  They try to release expansions that are balanced for the classes, they don't try to balance classes by releasing expansions.<br />
<br />
Valeris hits the nail on the head that balance cannot help but be affected by expansions.  Class balance, done perfectly, means that every class has an equally viable role in the game and equally viable avenues of progression.  It's inevitable that errors will be made along the way, and waiting for the fix is a long and painful process for many.  Anyone who thinks it's easy hasn't read these boards very thoroughly.  Although I am not enduring the same hardships as many warriors, it's clear that they went off course far enough ago that they are now well off the mark.<br />
<br />
I forget who I'm paraphrasing (Valeris mebbe), but you can't fix class balance with itemization, spells or content, but you can break it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
While I heartily agree about not using an expansion to balance content, I have to wonder if anyone making the expansions is paying great attention to balance.  What will be left of the pure melees if there is another expansion with 5 more levels of spells and we get 2 points to damage bonus and a couple hundred hit points?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Garoar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Actually boxed class balance (or imbalance) should be discussed.<br />
<br />
PoP.<br />
Levels were raised to 65 for all classes. = (balanced)<br />
New AA abilities for All classes. = (balanced)<br />
New Armor for All classes. = (balanced)<br />
New Spells for Casters. = (Melee?)<br />
<br />
LoY.<br />
New Armor for All classes. = (balanced)<br />
New Spells for Casters. = (Melee?) (can anyone say /ooc buying Temperance ?)<br />
<br />
LDoN.<br />
New Armor for All classes. = (balanced)<br />
New Augments for All classes. = (balanced)<br />
New Spells for Casters. = (Melee?) (Spirit of Shrew wow now several classes can cast indoor sow like the orcs in CC finally)(BoV)(BST's get a pet rune)<br />
<br />
I count 3 expansions where casters getting something &quot;new&quot; while pure melee get nothing &quot;new&quot;, I wont even discuss how useless an item/AA/Spell is to the class but mearly aquiring something. 3 expansions of casters getting something more than thier non casting counterparts is Unbalanced because before these last 3 expansions Pure melee classes must have been GODS for us to be un-upgraded this long. glad to see they've been balanced to our superior level.<br />
<br />
I said, we don't use expansions as a tool to balance the game. <br />
<br />
It's not what you said, it's what you didn't say, they unbalance the game with boxed spells while giving pure melee classes jack<br />
show me one thing LoY gave the level 45 pure melee to balance against a 45 Cleric who got Temperance, unless we're &quot;graced with Temperance buff and thats our &quot;Prize&quot;? Pure melee classes have been getting coal in our stockings the last 3 expansions and its starting to feel like Santa has it out for us. <br />
<br />
I'm not going to say its your fault Absor, for all I know you fight everyday with the higher ups about pure melee classes sucking ass, but if you say one thing to let us know that, you'd loose your job, but one thing is for certain you have put your foot in your mouth a couple times. Welcome to the PR position everyone always shoots the messenger. I don't envy your job, or the SoE Dev's they're in a spot I don't see getting out of, all I can say is good luck, civil wars are never fun all you can do is try to respect the opposing forces while you gut each other.</div></div><hr />

You guys are forgetting that while everyone can utilize the new improved LFG tool, warriors receive the most benefit  and use from it.  Oh wait, that's what they said about AC.  Nevermind.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Basically, a casters spells are his weapons.  So you need to look at what weapons melee got, and compare them with spells.  This should be obvious to any EQ player worth his salt.  <br />
<br />
I'm in no way saying melee are balanced, just making the point that stating  Melee have gotten nothing in 3 expansions while casters have gotten spells isnt really a fair comparison.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Except itemisation primarily deals with keeping the status quo constant whereas spells tend to do more. :)<br />
<br />
 I'll agree though that there has been some improvement (more aggro proccers, augs) it's just far too little and also requires you to go out and purchase it with far more effort than most spells require. that and itemisation doesn't tend to be all that balanced atm....</div></div><hr />

  <br />
<br />
While you can argue that point for classes like Wizards, mages, necros, etc... try saying that again regarding Paladins, Shadow Knights, Beastlords, Rangers, etc... who all get the wonderful weapon upgrades that melees do (often the very same weapon mind you..) plus they get nice new spells. <br />
<br />
Also, I wonder where absor went too? things heat up, time for him to leave? heh.. the fires of truth are not easily extinguished.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">casters have gotten weapons too...<br />
actually, the weapons they get are much more tasty then the melee weapons, to make up for their lack of skill regarding that weapon... which is fine...<br />
melees could be getting a few clickies that would make up for the lack of spells though... and we dont get much of those.<br />
<br />
Though comparing spells to weapons is a bit like comparing a nail to a toolbox.<br />
<br />
Each expansion, casters have beeing getting a bigger and bigger toolbox..<br />
while melees have been getting bigger sized nails..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">To say that melee have gotten nothing is just totally ignoring the fact that melee benifit from equipment much more than casters.  <br />
<br />
I would agree with you if Vengeance did HALF of what fuckin flowing thought or a ID/IH/SH/MP Focus does for a caster.  It's simply not true anymore.  An elemental caster gains a metric fuckload of benefit from the effects on his gear, while a melee is basically a melee.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">&quot;To say that melee have gotten nothing is just totally ignoring the fact that melee benifit from equipment much more than casters.&quot;<br />
<br />
You mean the same equipment that hybrids all wear too?<br />
<br />
Or do you mean the equipment that CASTERS also get?<br />
<br />
Casters get spells, armor, weapons.<br />
<br />
Hybrids get spells, armor, weapons.<br />
<br />
Melees, however, get armor and weapons.<br />
<br />
2/3 as effective.<br />
<br />
&quot;Basically, a casters spells are his weapons. So you need to look at what weapons melee got, and compare them with spells. This should be obvious to any EQ player worth his salt. &quot;<br />
<br />
Any EQ player worth his salt would also realize that focus effects and caster specific effects have made casters much more LOOT dependant than ever before.<br />
<br />
While melees continue to be extremely loot dependent, they're getting no benefits from their mana or focus effects.<br />
<br />
And I swear to god, I'm SICK AND FREAKING TIRED of wearing DRUID armor as a monk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Striken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I tried to throw in the disclaimer at the bottom, seems to have been overlooked.<br />
<br />
So I'll say it again; I in no way said that I think Melee are balanced.  But to imply that they have gotten -nothing- in 3 expansions borders on whining.   Nothing means... nothing.  Zero.<br />
<br />
And I'm fully aware of what  foci effect does for a caster.  Hybrids seem to be the bigger problem (as you can see from the many responses to my previous post).  And short of a REALLY big change on how melee's work, I dont really see an easy fix to it=\<br />
<br />
And I liked the Nails to toolbox comparison.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Deadalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">To clarify Wubao's point:<br />
<br />
Casters get spells, weapons, and armor they can use 100% of the stats on.<br />
Hybrids get spells, weapons, and armor they can use 100% of the stats on.<br />
Warriors, monks, rogues get weapons, and armor they can use 50-60% of the stats on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">We're talking about Class gains, not general gains...<br />
items aren't tied to class ability...<br />
levels aren't tied to class ability... both are things that come naturally with any expansion (though we even got shafted on itemisation and aas...)<br />
<br />
Warriors, as a class, never got anything... except /shield 2 years ago....<br />
so if we leave out /shield, we got zero, for the last 4 years at least. Which is extremely pathetic.<br />
<br />
Can't wait for WoW :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Anker steadfast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I agree, most skills and abilities that Warriors have are shared with others.<br />
Even though we have disciplines and AA's others do not, they have AA's and disciplines that we don't, so those are balanced out more or less. Which leaves /shield and Bezerk.<br />
<br />
All the rest is shared with other classes.<br />
<br />
Monks and Rogues are in a bit better shape.<br />
Monks have Feign Death and Mend.<br />
Rogues have Backstab, Hide +Sneak = unbreakable invis, Sneak at running speed.<br />
<br />
The rest is shared, Bards can pick locks, Vah Shir have innate Safe Fall .. etc. etc., it's getting to the point where everyone seems to be able to do just about everything and that hurts the pure Melee classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Yehan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I really hate  to misquote, or quote out of context, however I believe in the English language that you basically summarize your point at the end of your written message.  In that spirit, here is Absor's  last paragraph of the message that started this whole thread:<br />
quote: <br />
____________________________________________________<br />
Simply put, we're improving the game. If you don't like that, then I suppose I don't really care. We're not doing it for you, BB, we're doing it for the folks that have played this game for the last 5 years, helped it grow, made friends, built a community and had fun. Those are the folks that keep us at our computers late into the night. It's for them that members of the team wake up in the middle of the night to answer ringing phones when something breaks. We add new features, new tech, and any other great ideas we can for those people. We want them to continue to enjoy playing this game because they enjoy it, not just because WoW isn't out yet.<br />
<br />
____________________________________________________<br />
<br />
 I admire everyone at SOE for putting up with us.  We rant, we rave we complain, we whine and we moan... <br />
<br />
And Oh wait! We pay $12 bucks a month for the priviledge! <br />
<br />
Face it, it is not as black and white as this picture, it isn't even  we are right they are wrong and it has never been.  It is all shades of gray, lost among other shades of gray...<br />
<br />
Fact is, Absor is correct in saying they are improving the game and truly all improvements and all expansions have made EQ enjoyable for a great majority of people. <br />
<br />
 Just not melee.<br />
<br />
But hey, that's their problem right? Just Roll a knight...<br />
<br />
I am going to have to agree with Furor here.</div></div><hr />
