<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tanise</div><div class="date">03-05-2004, 01:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I parse with Yaulp and am told 90ish ballpark. This sounds right when compared to back during velious when I did most of my parses and studied dps. Now with all the dps AA etc it seems wrong. Though a decently geared monk friend claims his dps is 190, and a BL friend claims he + pet are about the same (190). I had always believe monks were supposed to be a dps class so...<br />
<br />
A friend parsed me while tanking in Sol ro, normal flaming head trash, and said I was averaging 180. With all the aa etc that seems right except when compared to my monk friend, though I do not know what was used to parse him.<br />
<br />
So somewhere from 90-180? =P</div></div><hr />

<br />
I parse 110-130dps tanking in Earth, but I lack a great deal of worn ATK I could possibly have if I were to be wearing a full suit of Raex gear.  A weapon like a BoW is also a suitable weapon to take advantage of ripostes with as well, as my fellow warrior buddy in my guild parses 3-10dps higher than I do on average tanking in Earth because he has his Double Riposte AAs maxed. <br />
<br />
It is rather funny though how I sometimes outdamage the monks in my guild, though we haven't been in the elementals long enough to get some Fiery Staffs of Zha or anything.  They will soon, at least.  :D</div></div><hr />
