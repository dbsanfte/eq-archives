Jaeth, milah, and somebody else.    Im in a guild with 20-30 pre-time raiders and we are currently working our way through VT.    My questoins are fairly general.  How often do their AE's go off?  Can you seperate them so you only engage one at a time?   Anybody have a good strategy for them?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rikam</div><div class="date">03-04-2005, 07:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They appear to hit for quad 1700 and have a 1500 dd ae but range of 20 on AE(targeted AE so 20 feet from the targeted char). AE has resist check that is avg of all Sv -250(if just starting into VT you will be getting hit by AE)<br />
<br />
They appear to be perma rooted till 30-40% hp and they need LOS to hit you with AE come up with a strat and go to town thats not all that hard.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Clear the hill, and clear around one of them.. then assign a pally/sk to the other 2.. from range you can agro them, so they only ae the pally/sk.. the mobs around them wont assist and come after you, while they do that, slightly away from the raid.. the rest of the raid kills one.. the ae is SMALL radius.. iif tank is on one side, and rest of melee are max range on other, they will avoid it..<br />
<br />
Once one is dead, move back out of LoS med up, and wait for repops, clear them, then clera around another one, and repeat above, until all 3 are dead..<br />
<br />
its not really worth the time for the loot =I</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kazak</div><div class="date">03-06-2005, 08:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Depending on what your guild does I would say it is worth it.  It does drop greater runes which are nice.  Has an 80+ ac bp, that's decent.  And if you're in zone doing Lirah, Tiorpat, epics, etc. he is not out of the way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">retsin</div><div class="date">03-06-2005, 08:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is a rough map of the general area that one of my scouts drew for me:<br />
<br />
http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v397/necrro/Sharpshooter/Sharpshootersenlarged.jpg <br />
<br />
Basically the way we do it is to set up and buff on the hill south of Jaerth which is 100% safe.  They we clear around Jaerth and rush and kill him.  As was mentioned, the other SS's will AE the raid during the fight, but the AEs are very small radius so if the tank stays on one side and everyone else on the other they can be mostly avoided.  After Jaerth is dead we move back to the hilltop and camp the raid out to lose aggro on the other 2 Sharpshooters.  Its very important that everyone camping out do so in a place that the Sharpshooters do NOT have line of sight to them.  Otherwise the AEs will interpupt camping (30 second recast time on the AEs).<br />
<br />
Once the raid has camped out, reassembled and everyone is rezzed and rebuffed we clear the wanderers and then move to the hilltop SE of Nihl and the clear around him and rush him.  Once again once he is dead we camp out on the hill to lose aggro.  From there we just clear around counter clockwise until we get to Nass.<br />
<br />
I'm in a small pre-elemental guild and although this event is a challenge for us its doable and we are getting it down to a science.  In terms of risk vs. reward it can be a lot of work to get one piece of loot and two runes but the loot is very nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">daw4888</div><div class="date">03-06-2005, 12:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">dont need the raid to camp out, just send a chanter or 2 up to blur the archers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">retsin</div><div class="date">03-06-2005, 04:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes mem blur is an option but given that there will still be a lot of mobs up around the other 2 SSs and given aggro radius in RCoD, we've found camping out to be the best option for us. We are pretty organized and efficient about it, so it doesn't slow the raid down by much.  Your mileage may vary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Garim</div><div class="date">03-08-2005, 01:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the info guys.  Hopefully Ill be able to talk us into trying it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stephen51</div><div class="date">03-10-2005, 04:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Are the Archers Slowable? I take it they can be debuffed prior to engagement, due to them being rooted?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">retsin</div><div class="date">03-10-2005, 05:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Are the Archers Slowable? I take it they can be debuffed prior to engagement, due to them being rooted?<br />
<br />
Yes they are partially slowable.  I am sure they can be debuffed prior to engaging but have a pally or sk get aggro from a distance while you are doing so or your debuffers are gonna get with the AE.  We haven't done it this way -- we've just rushed -- because there usually isn't a lot of time after clearing around one of them to get it dead before repops happen.  Their damage output isn't insane so debuffing after the tank has enaged hasn't been a problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Froggerx Xreggorf</div><div class="date">03-11-2005, 11:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can one group this kill with a bard, rogue, rogue, cleric, shaman.  Only person that needs to get hit by the ae to do this is the warrior... What ya do is stand behind the little ledge on the left side of the first sharpshooter, theres a tree and a wall, ae doesn't hit you there if your low enough. Have the warrior chain bazu bellow about 10-15 times, then area taunt, have him invis and run far back until the ae doesn't hit him anymore. With all the aggro the warrior has built up, the kyv's really want to tear him a new one. This is when you have your dps start attacking, he wont fight back and when he dies just bring the war back and do the same thing to the other 2. Dependant on the other you kill them in, you can also choose which item you want to drop. Its a very trivial fight, sorta like Lirah the Bridgeekeeper. Battlemaster/Zun are slightly harder, zun's just bad due to the ae's, but extended range 5 augs are out now and now that event is even easier aswell. Battlemaster is like, ralllos zek with named adds thrown in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">retsin</div><div class="date">03-12-2005, 04:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Does anyone know definitively what kill order leads to what loots?  We have done this event a couple times and  done Jaerth &gt; Nihl &gt; Nass and that has led to the ring both times but I was chalking that up to coincidence.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kazak</div><div class="date">03-12-2005, 11:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We have killed Nass last every time and gotten BP, Neck, and Ring.</div></div><hr />

My guild is a little reluctant to try it, thinking like a lot of the unknown, that its going to be too tough for us.<br />
<br />
1. Where are they? Map in this thread shows a valley with an entrance from the south. When we were doing the Breeder the other night, I went looking for them, and couldnt see anything equating to the area shown on the map. Then a friend told me it was actually just outside the Breeder area, up the bank from the Ungi the Swift spawn. This Valley has entry from the west. Is that the right place?<br />
<br />
2. All three of the Sharpshooters are quite far apart. If you go with the Pally/SK method of keeping agro on the other SS's do you therefore need to clear the spawns inbetween? As casting on the mob a stun etc would cause surrounding mobs to agro? Do the mobs not assist the SS?<br />
<br />
3. A Druid tracked the SS's from the Breeder camp and could only see 2 out of 3 (Nass was missing). Was this just a range thing, or can the mobs spawn at different times? Can these mobs spawn independently or could this just have been a failed attempt at the event? What is the respawn time on them?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">03-14-2005, 10:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't be scared to try OoW mobs.  My guild has found that we can kill a lot of stuff in OoW that drops loot that is &quot;out of our league&quot; so to speak.  A lot of fights (like the battlemaster or the fire chick in WoS) are more about strats and coordination than raw power.  If your guild is capable of working together and has a little discipline, you can do very well in OoW even without great gear on everyone.  Of course nice gear helps :)  but you can make up for it with strategy, especially if your tanks are pretty tuff.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1.  Yes.  If you stand on the ledge (right where Stoneworker spawns) and look straight ahead at the spot where Ungi spawns, you will see a hill going up past the tunnel entrance.  That is the path to Kyvs.<br />
<br />
2.  I have not personally tried that method, so I cannot say for certain.  It was stated in this thread thought hat the surrounding trash does not asist the SS.  <br />
<br />
3.  In my experience they all pop at the same time- I would guess that is a range issue for your tracker.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">daw4888</div><div class="date">03-16-2005, 02:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Correct the mobs around them DO NOT assist them.. its a easy way to controll the 2 you arnt engageing at the times ae's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Garim</div><div class="date">03-22-2005, 10:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, Im still working on this.   What I cant figure out, is where do you put the healers?<br />
<br />
My plan at the moment is to put the raid on the hill abouve Jaeth to setup.  Then have a SK run down and aggro Jaeth, build aggro, and then get out of Jaeth's LoS, while the raid kills Jaeth.    Is this a good idea? and where do the healers need to be, to be out of the AoE hitting the SK, and in range to keep the SK alive?  It seems like you can get out of LoS of the three Sharpshooters and still hold aggro on Jaeth.  I did this the other day while scouting.<br />
<br />
If you do the three tank method, do you clear the whole area, then run the three tanks out to get aggro then have them hide out of LoS?  I dont think i have the healers to keep all three tanks alive if they are all getting hit with one AoE apeice.<br />
<br />
Usually i would just do this and figure it out, but in this case, my guild is a bunch of slackers.   =D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">retsin</div><div class="date">03-22-2005, 02:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think you are making this a lot more complicated then it needs to be,<br />
<br />
The AE has a very small radius, so you can put the healers pretty much anywhere and keep them out of it.  Even the melees don't need to get hit as long as they stay away from the tank.<br />
<br />
Having a knight tank from outside of los is probably not going to work for a couple reasons.  First, I am 95% sure that the Sharpshooters summon.  I recall both myself being summoned while tanking this as well as having one of our over-zealous wizards summoned.  Second, after a certain point (I think it's around 30% health) the Sharpshooters do come unrooted and will move around.<br />
<br />
Just have a warror tank.  Have the healers creep down the hill toward Jaeth to be in range for heals.  Once assist is called the melees rush down the hill and stay as far away from the tank as possible to avoid the AEs.  If you want, put 2 knights and 2 healers on the other Shooters from range, although this is optional.  If you tank is storng enough and you have a healer that can MGB Cel Regen during the fight, there really isn't any reason to have tanks on the other two.  After Jaerth is dead either camp the raid out or mem blur the other 2 Shooters to lose aggro.  Rez, rebuff, move on to the next.  <br />
<br />
Wash, rinse, repeat.</div></div><hr />
