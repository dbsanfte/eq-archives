<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wilhelmm_Lanys</div><div class="date">12-28-2003, 03:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As many of you know, I've been a HUGE proponent of warrior fixes on this board and our previous ezboard site. As most were when they heard about these changes, i was stoked to learn of the melee fixes coming. While the openings system hasn't been added, incite and the new disc system has been in place for a bit more than a week now. So, what is the final verdict?<br />
<br />
My vote: AMAZING. Simply put, these are by far the best days warriors have had since late SoV. But, just saying Yea or Nay isn't enough. Let's analyze deeper:<br />
<br />
Pro:<br />
- Incite. I swear this skill is like getting that one birthday you've always wanted. Yea, it's not massive hate. Yes, it has an endurance cost. Yes, it has short range. Whatever. But fucking DAMN, this is what we've wanted for 3+ years. This is very noticeable on-demand agro. 400 hate, hate dot, 30 second reuse. And really, by the time the skill refreshes, you're practically at 100% endurance again. No question this is the best thing that's happend to warriors since RoK.<br />
- Incite, part II - Ranged agro. Now, I know, it's only 100 range, and that is quite short. 150 would have definetely been nice. But holy crap, assist a puller, bust it and that mob is yours. On multiple pulls, incite is an absolute gem. If the mobs are close and you bust incite on one, the other one is all over you like Johnny Cochrin on a celebrity criminal case. This gives the mezzers and slowers ample time to engage without lubing their ass up<br />
- Mitigation changes. Perfect. Now, 4-5% isn't massive, and when using a disc, it still comes out to the same amount as we had prior. HOwever, the bottom line is, warriors finally have non-disc mitigation better than anyone other class. Can't argue that<br />
- Failed taunt message. Useful little tool, especially in determining when to breaK mez/use incite<br />
<br />
Now, naturally, these changes aren't perfect. There are some cons:<br />
- Taunt. The failed message really opened my eyes. The skill has an even lower success rate than I imagined. I thought taunt was at least successful 50% of the time. HOwever, from recent parses that I've ran, I'm thinking taunt has more of a 30-40% success rate, with annoying streaks of up to 6 straight failed taunts. NOw, I don't really know if this has always been true and I've not noticed, or if this maybe is a recent change to prevent &quot;agro-lock.&quot; Either case, I think this is a bit low. <br />
- EB weapons. I know, I've said this before on other threads. But I swear, since the upgrades it seems I can't for the love of me buy a proc on my BoW. Now, oddly enough, this only seems to be true on my BoW, as my Call of the Sky proc is going off at pretty much the same rate.<br />
- Endurance. Incite is decent cost. HOwever, some of the discs are really a drain on endurance. Stonewall, which I was so excited about, is turning into little more than a raid tool due to the snare, and especially the endurance drain. Healing will; WAYY too much endurance. DEfensive is fine, haven't ran evasive yet. The offensives I haven't goten a chance to run, but I will try to do so in the next few.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, I know that i have a few cons listed there. Make no mistake though, the Pros absolutely demolish the cons in my mind. I wouldn't mind seeing a few tweaks on the system, especially with the taunt and endurance (I'm thinking endurance is gonna play a bigger role as openings develop). But, even if they don;t, these changes are simply awesome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">12-28-2003, 04:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">had my first real proper run out with incite today in an exp group and im very happy. the range doesnt bother me, i still tag on incoming and hit it when im pretty sure mob is well within 100 feet.<br />
<br />
its nice to grab instant aggro off the puller and with a careful sham/ench i wasnt losing aggro too often to slow or debuff.<br />
<br />
was also nice for multiple mobs in camp as i can incite the add and get back on the original one without running around like a madman trying to lock em down. <br />
<br />
endurance looked fine to me. never had a problem with it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm on record somewhere as a flag-waver for the tweaks.  I'm really enjoying them; pretty much, I am completely in agreement with your points.  Stuff like EB procs, I can't respond to, tho my toys seem to make sparkles at the same rate they always did.<br />
<br />
I can't seem to decide if endurance costs are too high, or if regen is too slow, or if it's just upkeep costs that are too high ... or if it's all in my head.  But most of the time I feel that the upkeep disciplines burn out the END pool too quickly, and would be balanced with a lowered upkeep (and maybe a slight kick up for initial cost).  I am still getting used to having to watch that, of course, and I know that there is still more to come.  And so, I'm not powerfully worried about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CATEIRE</div><div class="date">12-28-2003, 04:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree in most part with wil. <br />
<br />
Although, the taunt message is nice for breaking a Mez, all it does is piss me off seeing how much it fails. All I can say is Thank god for Anger III and other agro generators.<br />
<br />
After a bit of toying around with Incite, in both grind and raid situations, I find that it is a welcome tool to use when the stuff gets thick. I preffer to use it only when my regular taunting gimmicks arent enough or if there is a situation where I need to multi tank. Useing it as such I never see my Endurance less than 80% unless of course I need def stonewall or fury. <br />
<br />
I like the disc separation it makes sense for the most part. <br />
<br />
I applaud the changes to date and look forward to the Mele opening changes to go live. <br />
<br />
<br />
NOTE:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Partha</div><div class="date">12-28-2003, 12:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Provoke line is wonderfully done - there's only one problem with it.<br />
<br />
 If you nail a mob with it before mez is broken, you'll notice they flinch - so does everyone assisting me on the mob. :( <br />
<br />
 As far as the discs, I'm finding their costs balanced pretty well, as well - was able to tank a mob under full Defensive, and when that dropped, had Endurance enough for a good chunk of dropping an offensive disc.<br />
<br />
 Did I mention that the 30 seconds on Mightystrike is great for Paladin ego-checks? :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kamidari</div><div class="date">12-28-2003, 04:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm pretty happy with the changes.  Incite is very nice at getting initial aggro more reliably, and I love being able to do furious followed by defensive or stonewall to start a nasty fight.<br />
<br />
However, from recent parses that I've ran, I'm thinking taunt has more of a 30-40% success rate..<br />
I'm curious what your sample size was for that.  I've been checking my logs somewhat often since the changes, with the parses usually showing about 60% success.  Latest tally is 2365 taunts with 999 failures, so that's 58% success, which seems reasonable to me.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hyardgune</div><div class="date">12-29-2003, 10:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I love the changes.  Incite has been great.  It isn't aggro-lock and I'm glad for that.  I'm loving Stonewall.  Takes a while to get used to and the self-snare can make things challenging but it is nice.  My offensive discs, wow, it is awesome to be able to use them.  I used my offensive discs more this past weekend than I did since I hit 55.<br />
<br />
I'm happy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khumak</div><div class="date">12-29-2003, 02:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Overall I'm pretty happy with the changes.  Here's my tally of pros and cons:<br />
<br />
Pros:<br />
<br />
1.  Incite rocks, pure and simple.  <br />
2.  Unlinked defensive discs rock.  I don't use them much in xp groups but being able to use both Furious and Stonewall on the same boss in raids kicks ass.<br />
<br />
Cons:<br />
<br />
1.  Aggressive was nerfed.  Bigtime.  I miss my old Aggressive.  IMO they should separate our short duration offensive discs from our long duration offensive discs.  I'd like to see them put on the same timer as Furious/Fortitude.  For raids I'd use Furious most of the time and for xp groups I'd use Fellstrike.<br />
<br />
2.  Endurance costs on the disciplines seems a bit too high, especially if the opening system that's going in later will also drain endurance.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeka</div><div class="date">12-29-2003, 03:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I feel some of the reset times are a bit too long.  After all it is the reset time that effectively killed the old discipline system.  Endurance should be the major restriction not the reset timer.<br />
<br />
As mentioned in other places, reset times are hard limitation and should be used sparingly.  It makes sense to have reset/cooldown times for powerful abilities but I'm not convinced many abilites need this.  Why can't you turn off an offensive ability wait 2 minutes and then turn it on again?  As long as you have Endurance you should be able to use most offensive skills at will without worrying about &quot;blowing&quot; them.<br />
<br />
I don't know...is there a mechanic I am missing because having skills restricted by Endurance and cooldown seems exessive for most skills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aveen</div><div class="date">12-29-2003, 03:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here are my thoughts:<br />
1. Incite I love it but I think it is still a tad underpowered. Its a ton better than what we had, but i think they need to bump the initial hate up to 500 or 550.  It usually tanks 3 procs of anger 2 (450 hate) to get agro back if I loose it. Incite is good and like an insta-proc, but it is a far cry from getting a mob of a dying cleric or shaman. I think at the least it should compare to the sort of hate of a paladin's stun. since we can use it only once every 30 seconds. I don't think it would even need to genereate additional hate if it could just be all at once. <br />
<br />
2. Healing will. This is a nice addition, but it would be nice to be able to use this during combat as well.  At the level its given out, its barely 1/6th of my unbuffed hit points. So its not enough to solo with but it would be nice if say the healer goes down because incite was just not enough agro and the mob is almost dead, you could pop it and actually live through the attack. The idea is sound, but it is too limited as it is.<br />
<br />
3. Stone Wall. This seems like a defensive except you snare yourself. On boss mobs that fear it has a use, but that makes it really too situational imo. <br />
<br />
4. the cost of defensive needs to be brought down. <br />
<br />
5. I absolutly love that the timers have been largely unhooked. <br />
<br />
6.  I think that by right clicking a skill, a description of what the skill does should be displayed just like for spells.  Like for healing will, it should say &quot;heals for x damage for x time&quot; just like the celestial heal spells say &quot;heals for min of x damage at a level up to y damage at b level for z time&quot; I don't see anything wrong with have the information about just what these things do.<br />
<br />
7. I freaking love that I get a message if taunt fails. Yes I still use it a tad before breaking mez. I usually don't use it otherwise because it can end up reseting my hate after I get a lot of procs and use incite which sucks.<br />
<br />
All in All I think that its a good start. Things still need to be tweaked and I am confident that they will be. I'm looking forward to more things being added.  BUT, in no way should anyone try to fool themselves into thinking that the disparity between knights and warriors is gone. Incite is semi-reliable in that we know when we press the button something happens, but aside from that, were still pretty much where we have been for the last 18 months with respect to knights.</div></div><hr />

What are you losing agro to that causes 901+ hate? Generally when I lose agro, 1 proc is enough to recover.<br />

Never had my agro reset due to taunt. Ever. And I even tested this on many occasions.<br />

If I have solid agro, and land a taunt, I retain my solid agro. /Shrug<br />

Could it be that your taunting an average 5.5 times per minute? Which would basically work out to every single time it wasn't greyed out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe not the most efficient use of taunt but I don't see why it would cause a reduction in taunt success.  You can still get a successful taunt when you already have aggro so for testing purposes you WANT to taunt as often as possible to get the largest sample size...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">12-31-2003, 06:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's no way for me to prove this, but it almost feels like when you mash taunt as fast as possible the game notices it and makes you fail more than usual.  It feels as if you let the taunt buttom to have some time to 'recharge' it'd have a higher chance of succeeding.  Probably just my imagination, I know...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Heimdall-RN</div><div class="date">12-31-2003, 11:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd agree that its probably just your imagination.  No slight intended, I'm just thinking from a business standpoint, but the extra coding to make that happen would be wasted compared to what else they could have coded, and compared to what they did code, and missed coding when the game first came out.  I have to believe Taunt is a simple pass/fail skill test.<br />
<br />
It COULD have been that the two of them were in different adventure themes, it could have been that one group was better at agro management than the other so Taunt had less to overcome to &quot;pass&quot; (Assuming the agro gap is part and parcel of the skill check.)<br />
<br />
They were in different difficulty settings- its possible that the &quot;resist&quot; check for the mobs in different themes or different difficulties change-  However I think the group doing the &quot;hard&quot; setting was probably just better at agro management, and therefore didn't have as much of an agro gap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikos</div><div class="date">12-31-2003, 11:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Seems more like a matter of luck. There are days taunt works exactly when I need it the most. <br />
<br />
But there are days it keeps failing 3-4 times in a row while mob is on the casters. At times like these, the mob dies with the casters being tanks. <br />
<br />
<br />
My last 2 Ldon adventures the fail rate of taunt has been horrid. 35%-45% success rate seems like what happened to me then. <br />
More common to get 3-4 failes taunts than to get 3 success in a row.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Heimdall-RN</div><div class="date">12-31-2003, 11:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">More common to notice and remember 3 failed taunts in a row, than 3 successful ones also.  Between Taunt, AETaunt, Incite, and EB/Anger You should almost always have some agro generation.  Since there's been very little opportunity to break Taunt down and figure out how it works, most speculation at this point is pretty useless.  We'll just have to wait for the people who enjoy poking and proding the game engine till they figure out how it works to come in and tell us what the testing says.<br />
<br />
What is the skill check for Taunt based on is something we'll need to be able to knowledgably comment on what's broke about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wilhelmm_Lanys</div><div class="date">12-31-2003, 04:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Damn. Boards ate my last post. Anyways, reason I'm taunting 5.5 times a minute is becuase for me, the first 2 or 3 taunts on a mob almost always fail. perhaps it was just a string of bad luck, but those were the results I'm having. Keep in mind, I did not use incite or AE taunt at all during this process, because i wanted to determine the effects of taunt alone. For me, a string of 4+ failed taunts isn't an uncommon occurence, or so it seems.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pros:  Incite helps.  It really does, but the issue of aggro will always be who knows what they can get away with. <br />
<br />
Stonewall -&gt;&gt; I used this to tank Eindride in the Bot Tower. Not when of the biggest hitters obviously, but it worked very well.  For mobs you can Vindi corner, if you can do it quick, it works pretty well for me.<br />
<br />
Cons: The taunt button.  Well, it seems it could be fixed somewhat.  The other day was on an RZ raid and a tank was breaking mez on one of the Decorin triggers.  At least 23 fails in a row.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Um, haven't you ever had to Tank a mob snared before?  If you turn sideways and sidestep, you can move along with most push a guild can do short of Paladin Knockbacks.  I do a fast turn 90 degrees sidestep and turn back, hardly missing any dps and never lose aggro.  Any dps you lose, well youre saving 55% (or 45%?) off the top anyways by going stonewall.  If the mob is exceptionally high dps, then exposing yourself to a sideshot is bad of course, so let your guildies die lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Heimdall-RN</div><div class="date">01-09-2004, 11:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yah I know about that, it also works with horses, and mobs like CT, and Grieg.  But these folks push a LOT.  Its easier for me to just defensive.  I still don't lose agro, but with Stonewall I usually end up spending more time not being able to see my target, than actually hitting it.</div></div><hr />
