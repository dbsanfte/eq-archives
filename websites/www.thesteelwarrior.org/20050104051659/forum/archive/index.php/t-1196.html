<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baadan</div><div class="date">06-12-2003, 05:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Does Magelo simply grant the wearer the full stats of charms? Since ALOT of people have one now, and the very large difference between them, how is Magelo going to handle these new charms and how does it handle them currently?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">06-12-2003, 05:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">you can enter your flags in magelo as well. so i wouldnt have thought it be that difficult for magelo to track that information and upgrade the stats on the charms once they have all the base info for all the stats for all classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gryzx</div><div class="date">06-13-2003, 04:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Except for alot of the other charms it can't possibly give a value (ie how is it going to calculate who many warriors are in your group normally for the charm of the brotherhood, or how many people are generally in your zone for the charm of solitude), Also magelo is missing at least 1 flag (maybe others), it doesn't have a spot of the quested tactics flag (which does affect the charm).  <br />
<br />
So while they might be able to add in code for that specific charm, they can't for many of the others (simply because of the way they work) so I doubt they'll add in code for a single charm, I believe currently it shows the max stats on the other charms, which I imagine it'll show on these once they are in the magelo database.</div></div><hr />
