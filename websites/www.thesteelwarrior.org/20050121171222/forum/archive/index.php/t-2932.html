By that I mean, if we were going to boycott LDoN, we should have gotten the word out strong and hard.  It's a good idea, but we have to move early, decisively, and in force.<br />
<br />
There are a ton of other class mains with warrior alts/twinks. (I met one the other day at L41 with better gear than my L62.) And if we boycotted LDoN, they would get all the new war drops, if there are any.<br />
<br />
So, what else can we do?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well I can't speak for Vamcoy, but if he jumped off a bridge... yea i'd follow... course I can also cast divine aura.  <br />
<br />
Seriously though, and only after Vamcoy had said something about this and having ordered the expansion did I even realize there was a push for a boycott.  I had a few thoughts on this... and perhaps to start I need to explain some of my thoughts on the whole warriors are broken subject.<br />
<br />
The warrior class is suffering, mainly due to the fact that knights through spells can both grab and maintain agro easier and more quickly.  This makes knights in many peoples eyes more desireable than a warrior in an exp group.  Nearly every class board that I've see the issue discussed on has a resounding message... something needs to be done.  Most of the talk centers around improving warriors in some fashion to fix their agro issues.<br />
<br />
The chief way a warrior currently can compensate for the lack of agro ability currently is through equipment, mainly that of weapons procs namely from what I understand EB weapons.  From my understanding these type of weapons are not easily attainable... certainly not as easy as a knight buying agro increasing spells.  What I do see with LDoN is the posibility that instead of relying on large scale raiding or long difficult camps, people will be able to obtain better equipment through accumulating points from dungeons.  Although not a perfect solution, it at least opens a door to an option that was not there before.  Of course I may be wrong in this.... time will tell.<br />
<br />
I could ramble on more about warriors not being all that broken, and knights just being to overpowered... but thats a different thread... and probably one that will get me flamed to kingdom come.</div></div><hr />

<br />
See, there are a few problems with this if this was the only reason you bought this expansion.<br />
<br />
1 -- Raiding warriors won't have problems.  I have a Blade of Carnage and a Sceptre of Destruction, and i'm at the absolute lowest end of the raid spectrum.  I've also noticed a marked improvement in my aggro ability since obtaining those weapons.<br />
<br />
2 -- Any warrior, and I do mean ANY warrior who is worth his salt nowadays can get the Hammer and Sword from droga and solve his aggro problems sufficiently well enough to not need to buy new gimmicks to hope it helps him.<br />
<br />
3 -- Even with procs, you are STILL a slave to the RNG, and warriors are still not on par with other melee who can generate aggro on demand.  My enraging blow doesn't mean shit if it doesn't fuckin proc, at which point I might as well be using orc pawn picks for all the good it's doing me.<br />
<br />
Will LDoN help warriors thru augmentable gear?  I really fuckin doubt it folks.  You might be able to add a proc here and a proc there, but lets be serious, you are still relying on procs and everyone else will still have to tiptoe around you in groups, and if you think otherwise, you're basically kidding yourself.</div></div><hr />

Basically a bandaid addition to &quot;fix&quot; warrior aggro. Unfortunately, the two big-name weapons with EB are also usable by Knights and Rangers and one is usable by Bards (Blade of War and Blade of Carnage, respectively).</div></div><hr />

I think it's stating facts.  If you're buying this expansion because you think augments are going to be the savior of the warrior class, you're going to be disappointed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sshaithis</div><div class="date">09-10-2003, 04:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, so let me get this straight.<br />
<br />
You're wanting to boycott an expansion, because warrior aggro is off-key?<br />
<br />
Now, don't get me wrong. I agree that warrior aggro is not right and that something needs to be done, but it's not game-breaking right now. <br />
<br />
And I'm supposed to follow you off one bridge (boycott) rather than the other (getting the expansion) because of this?<br />
<br />
<br />
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.<br />
<br />
I'm gonna buy the expansion. Why? Because I can. Because my friends are. because I have a small clique of friends outside of my guild that I would love to do 1-2 group encounters with and have fun. Not care about loot, not caring about efficiency, not caring about camp checks, not caring about hearing other people's incessant babble on ooc, not care about anything but blowing some shit up with some of my best online friends who don't often have 5-6 hours to dedicate to sitting in front of a computer just to kill 1 mob.<br />
<br />
I'd also advise people do do what they feel is best, if you want to boycott, be my guest. Personally, I'm gonna do what I feel is fun. Afterall, that's what I pay my monthly bill for, isn't it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tirien</div><div class="date">09-10-2003, 05:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yup LDoN just gave warriors bigger crutches.  Almost every weapon I looked at had a proc slot for augments.  But this fixes nothing.  Great I can add a second proc that might, or might not go off before the chanter tashes.  Unfortunately I have this sinking feeling that SoE thinks this is THE solution for warrior aggro problems....  I beg to differ, and am sure that most here will agree.  Every other tanking class has a guaranteed way of getting aggro, when is the warrior going to get his?  We have no advantages anymore, and don't anyone even start that crap about that we have that 500 extra hp, 500 hp don't mean squat when thats one hit from an xp mob.  And mitigation?  Well there just isn't any advantage there either as knights have that ability to easily match me through equipment.  <br />

Yet another disgusted warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">09-10-2003, 05:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just to be clear, i've never advocated anyone &quot;Boycott&quot; anything.  I don't buy more expansions because they don't put out quality work, and i won't until they balance their game and worry about the quality of the game over the quantity of their bank accounts.<br />
<br />
What i'm telling you is that if you think that this is gonna solve all of your problems, then you're wrong, it's not.  Furthermore, if you're pissed off at the state of this game, then speak with the only thing that a corporation that size is going to listen to....YOUR WALLET.<br />
<br />
I pay 26 bucks a month to hang out with my friends because it's cheaper than going to the bars, and there isn't another game out there that really can compete with EQ.  I will continue doing so until WoW comes out, or Sigil cranks out the mythological game they claim to have.  However, I'm not going to spend any more money than I have to in order to keep playing with my friends.  There is shitloads of content that 90% of the EQ population has never even seen, I guarantee it.  People don't need new expansions, they need to stop going to fuckin PoJ every fuckin nite and their content problems are solved.  What EQ needs is a fuckin balance revamp, and until that happens and they prove they care about their game, i'm not gonna bother spending more money to perpetuate the problem.</div></div><hr />

Look at the first post...a friendly jab.<br />
<br />
Second post...an explanation of facts that goes against the argument that &quot;LDoN will provide better options for warriors for holding aggro.&quot;  I don't believe it's true at all.<br />
<br />
Third post... justifying my stance and pointing out that there are a lot of people who are jumping on the &quot;SoE sucks&quot; bandwagon, but are also the first to fork over the cash for the new expansion, whatever it may be at the time.  Bottom line, if you want the bullshit to stop, you need to own the game, the game can't own you.<br />
<br />
If that is &quot;Jumping down people's throats,&quot; then obviously you haven't seen some of my other work.  I thought I was rather civil here.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just wanted to clarify that I never said, nor intended to come across as meaning LDoN would provide better options for holding agro, just that it may provide better options for obtaining equipment.  As you have pointed out does not fix the issue with warrior agro, but I hope it does make it a little more feasible for people not in huge raiding guilds to obtain upgrades.<br />
<br />
I must apologize for a bit of confusion here as to what I was getting at.... The post was really going in two directions, and I cut it off at the end because it was  kinda off topic.  Basically I was tackling the agro issue and LDoN equipment in one post, and while they relate to each other to an extent, it really is two separate issues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">09-10-2003, 01:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I bought LDoN on all 3 active accounts.  Played an adventure last night and it was a lot of fun.  Got 6/10 of an AA.  We finished with 20 minutes to spare despite the fact that we didn't know what we were doing and went down several dead ends.  I pulled and tanked with no problems.  Had 3 mobs in camp a lot, but no one except me ever dropped below half health.  Didn't pop AE taunt all the way through.   Not a single bug that I came across.  Dungeons were asthetically pleasing and pathing was excellent.  <br />

LDoN gets two thumbs up from me.</div></div><hr />

No camp stealing, no trains, no inane &quot;your ghey!&quot; &quot;u r so much more gheyer than me and u suxxors too!&quot; to spam the ooc channel.  At least at first glance this looks like a quality product.<br />

Does it in any way solve warrior issues?  Not a chance.  Did I think it would?  Nope.  It does provide new, fun, seemingly well designed content and that is all I was looking for.</div></div><hr />

I must say I love the way the mobs look, and I liked the fact that 2 tank groups are very effective.

<br />
No, the expansion doesn't give us better agro or wpns, but the lack of reliance on mana does increase the value of our class (at least a bit.)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulvar</div><div class="date">09-10-2003, 04:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So far my initial impression is that LDoN rules.  It was very fun dungeon crawling last night, we did one of the &quot;kill the named guy&quot; adventures in Tak and had a great time.  With a mostly level 65 group of warrior, monk, druid, mage, wizard, enchanter we finished the dungeon with about 30-35 minutes left on the timer (this was a normal level adventure).<br />
<br />
One thing I noticed is that you definately need some sort of crowd control or multiple tanks in a group to be effective.  3 pulls are very common and you don't really have the time to waste splitting pulls or goofing around with FD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DurgoECI</div><div class="date">09-10-2003, 05:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My observations from our 2 LDoN adventure runs last night:<br />
<br />
We started with a normal difficulty Mistmoore adventure with a group of all 65s (warrior, cleric, druid, bard, enchanter, ranger) who are all well equipped, but mostly below elemental equipment level.  We got an assassination assignment;it was a piece of cake.  Nothing hit too hard (300-400s max), and pulls were quite easy.  On the boss, the bard and I went LD as soon as we pulled, and the cleric died immediately thereafter, and the ench, druid, ranger still won without too much trouble.<br />
<br />
Later that night, we got cocky and decided to try a hard difficulty Takish-Hiz adventure.  This time we had all of the same people, except a 65 monk instead of the 65 ranger.  We ended up with a collection quest and needed to find 28 statues.  Umm, wow; this was a _lot_ harder.  Almost everything hit for 900ish.  2-3 pulls were not uncommon and pretty tough to deal with.  Resists weren't too bad, but the main problem we had was a lack of dps (and that's not really a bad dps group).  We wiped once, and partially wiped one or two other times.  We ran back each time and eventually ran out of time with about 17/28 items found.  It appears there are a few enchanter charmable mobs (some of the Va'Dyn style golems) if you're willing to deal with a pissed off ex-pet hitting your enchanter for 900.  We killed one of them very early on, and then later regretted it as we really needed the dps.  Once we found another, it was too little, too late.   Certainly not something I'm going to want to do all the time, but it's great to have a hard challenge available when you're feeling cocky.  ;)</div></div><hr />
