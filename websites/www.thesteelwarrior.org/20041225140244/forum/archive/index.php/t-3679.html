As you read the article, there is a listing of all knight penalties and how they have been removed over time.  My question is, with all the talk about nerfing knights and how they will lose their appeal to groups and going back to the Kunark days, how the hell are they going so far back?  The penalties are removed, knights are viable dmg classes with utility.  In Kunark that was a different story.  I could be just missing the point, but how is nerfing knights agro generation going to put them in the dark ages when they can still do other things for a group?</div></div><hr />

<br />
 1. When presented with two tanks with equal aggro control, regardless of any other factor the one with more HP/AC will be chosen.<br />

 2. Utility, although nice, is NEVER a reason anyone gets a group.<br />
<br />
 3. Said utility is much less powerful than you suppose.<br />

 4. The current situation is now 'balanced'. Any negative change is 'unbalancing.'<br />

They need to get over it, and move on, But sadly a once fine buncha player's have turned into pansy bastard children that have no respect for their parent classes. <br />

Oh yeah as for the arguement they will use. It boil's down to. <br />
&quot;Were on the top for XP group's and almost to the point where we can replace warrior's role's in raid's and you want us to give it up? Sheeeyeah right!&quot;<br />

1- Hybrid Spellbooks are useless.<br />
<br />
2- They don't have /disc defensive<br />
<br />
3- Warriors get just as much out of 100 hp/100 mana items as a hybrid because hybrid spellbooks are useless and warriors have /disc defensive<br />
<br />
4- Hybrids have to sacrifice a TON to get FT-15, because they have to fight with casters for those FT items.<br />
<br />
5- Hybrids get nothing out of focus effects.<br />

There's a few more whines that hybrids love to hide behind. Oh yeah, speaking of WHINING, hybrids will undoubtedly use the &quot;You warriors/monks whine too damn much&quot; line of defense too.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slyson Dycson</div><div class="date">10-15-2003, 06:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The way I am seeing things is, a knight is close to our HP and AC lvls right now.  As stated, they have the same 100hp items we do.  Most knights that I run into are not far behind me, although I am far from being high end.  They are roughly 50ac and less than 500 HP down from me at equal lvl and similar gear.  That is not game breaking or group ineffeciency amounts to slow people down.<br />
<br />
Lets suppose that agro spells, IE stun and what ever SK's get, are nerfed.  What you have is a similarly equiped knight that has the same agro control as a warrior.  They would have to rely on procs and our ohh so faithful taunt button.  I fail to see what left they would have to whine about.  Granted they don't have AS MUCH hp and ac, but damn near close.  A way to make up for it is with their utility spells, group spot heals, brells, atk buffs, etc.  They still can't be saying we have the dps advantage because just look at their 2h weapons with amazing ratio's.<br />
<br />
What I am getting at is, when you are in a pick up group, and you see a knight lfg and a warrior, it all comes down to do you want a slightly better tank when it comes to absorbing dmg, or do you want someone that will take 1 extra CH every 15 minutes that has some spells that will make the group more effecient?<br />
<br />
Yes we have defensive, but I always hate playing that card.  It is 3 years old as said.  Yes, we are raid tanks, just like clerics are raid healers.  You can get by with a knight tanking or a druid healing, but some situations are better suited for a certain class.  It is the way the game is designed.  Exp groups, they can use either class.  I have no problem sharing the exp tank role with a knight.  I just hate being told I suck because a knight can hold flawless agro while I work my ass off to be able to keep the mob on me when it is being slowed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I play two characters.  A Warrior, and a Paladin.  The Paladin is higher level at the moment only because he was the first character I ever played.  Both are similarly equipped (They wear the same armor and use mostly the same weapons.  Im poor).<br />
<br />
Ive got problems getting groups with either.  I just dont really have the gear yet.  I should likely take a few months to work on that.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I feel ive got at least a little knowledge on what im talking about.<br />
<br />
Plain and simple, why does anyone wanna see the nerf bat?  I know I dont.  I love both characters equally well.  I like being the big buff warrior kicking ass and taking names, and I like being old holy-knickers unleashing the Divine Wrath.<br />
<br />
Yes, warriors need something.  No, Paladins dont need to get beaten with the nerf stick.  The game has grown.  Warriors just havent grown with it.  Paladins have.  Warriors need to catch up with the game.  How?  I dont really know, theres been alot of good ideas all over the place on how to let Warriors grow to being useful in the game again.<br />
<br />
The paladins had a bad time of it back in the days of Kunark.  I wasnt really around for that, I only started recently.  Why are people yelling and screaming to nerf them back to the point where they cant have fun?  We all need to remember that this is just a game, and its there so we can have fun.  Thats what we pay for each month.  To have fun, not to get angry and start bickering over everything and screaming &quot;NERF NERF!&quot;.<br />
<br />
So I guess what im trying to say is that id rather see warriors gain than knights nerfed.  Cause every time someone goes for the nerf stick...god kills a ranger...</div></div><hr />

<br />
The first thing melee needs is improving.  After that I'm all for discussing whether or not Knights need nerfed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thaak</div><div class="date">10-16-2003, 02:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aeka, I think it'd be too big of a game design change to work on ALL the classes to one another, so it'd be more viable to balance the classes to other classes of the same nature.<br />
<br />
IE: tanks, damage,  healers, casters, or whatever other combos you want.<br />
<br />
Once the general groups are balanced within themselves, we can work on balancing the genres together.</div></div><hr />

The main point I am trying to get across is that even if they are nerfed, knights will not be thrown back into the dark ages.  So much of the game has changed that unless all the penalties are put back in place again, knights will not be able to go that far back if they are nerfed.<br />
<br />
I am really just trying to steal knights thunder when they say that if they are nerfed, they will go back to Kunark, when in fact, they will be way ahead of Kunark even if the bat starts swinging.  I am not calling for it, I am one who thinks we need a boost, not decrease others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wudedorm</div><div class="date">10-16-2003, 02:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">imo I dont think most warriors here were yelling for Paly nerf---UNTIL--Absor came out with classes are not that out of balance(meaning nothing is going to be fixed for a long time most likely). This infuriated the majority of the warrior community, as most every class on EQ KNOWS agro is F.U.B.A.R. <br />
By calling for Paly nerf which seems to be one class that gets some attention by SOE(why I would really like to know), it might get our situation looked at(at least how I see it).<br />
Either that or people are just so pissed that we wont be getting anything, at least make the ground more even.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">10-16-2003, 04:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aeka, Gumdaor, I have to agree with you up to a point.  The game has grown and warriors haven't grown with it.  I wrote a novel in this post on all the various arguments, then deleted it and started over because I'm pretty sure you've seen them all here many times before and you've seen the responses to them.  The bottom line is that every time anyone suggests any kind of an improvement to warriors, a huge percentage of knights start screaming &quot;But you have defensive, you get to be the raid tank!&quot;  and there are other idiots who scream &quot;Improving warriors will break the raiding game!&quot; , even though 90% of the server population doesn't give a damn about the high end raiding game, and even if they did, if knights are as close to warrior tanking levels as the seem to be from where I sit, the fact that they have aggro lock has already pretty much broken the raiding game anyway.  Basically, if things are unbalanced, and nobody wants to improve warriors, the only other alternative that allows for balance among tank classes is to nerf knights.  Personally I'd rather have warriors improved than have knights nerfed, but most warriors have gotten so damned disgusted by the empty promises from SOE, and all the paladin's who are terrified of losing their godlike tank status, they just want knights to be on the bottom again to remind them what it's like.  Again, I don't want that, but I sure as hell understand why so many warriors feel that way.  For every paladin or sk that is reasonable and admits that warriors need some serious help, there seem to be 10 that are still jealous of the status warriors had in Velious and want to see us continue to suffer.  And as Wudedorm said, Absor's &quot;The classes are not that out of balance&quot; statement just brought all that frustration to a boiling point.  It was possibly the single most poorly thought out and patently false statement I've heard since Al Gore invented the internet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gumdaor</div><div class="date">10-16-2003, 09:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Im sticking by what I said.  The nerf stick shouldnt be used period.  Taking away isnt the answer.  Taking away just screws things up worse.  Casters will still have grown, and now Knights are down in the warrior pit where we've all not grown with the game.<br />
<br />
Give to warriors.  Thats fine, I want to see that.  Im never gonna be a main tank on a major raid anyways.  I dont have the gear, the time, or the dedication to manage that.  I like playing the game to have fun.  Taking stuff away from me to &quot;balance&quot; things is just taking my fun, tripping it, and then stabbing it repeatedly.<br />
<br />
Balance by adding, not taking away.</div></div><hr />

<br />
bullshit, utility plays a big part in groups<br />
<br />
if your with a shaman, and you are a paladin, you can give the shaman buffs to give them more HP, which they can canni for more mana, if your with a druid, you can use your buffs AND their buffs, in BOTH cases with those said healer you dont have any method of ressing, and if you are in a hard to reach area of a zone like veksar or you had used lull or bard calm to get past mobs to on a assassin mission(once it poped) in both these cases the paladin shines and chances are he will live to do the res with LoHs to use on himself or, prevent the death all togeather<br />
<br />
utility does get you groups with 2 of the three healer types, if you argue your a moron, you cant tell me that in those situations, your utility doesnt help with grouping, the only time your abilitys are as under valued as you play them is when your with a cleric(which is 1/3 of the time), and what, you want to beat out clerics in ability to? untiliy can get you a group</div></div><hr />

It would be pointless as several have said you can't argue with their logic, so doing so would net nothing.  However I would like to point out a few flaws that are glaringly apparent.<br />
<br />
The assumption your with a cleric only 1/3rd of the time because their are 3 priest classes is ludicrous.  Unless you have SOE's population distribution numbers, and know how many characters are being botted, you won't be able to assume anything concrete as to how often you get one of the priest classes as your healer.  Personaly, I'm rarely grouped with a druid healer, and never a shaman.  Shamans just don't have the heals to keep up with my damage.  75-80% of the groups I'm in have cleric healers, if not higher percentage then that.  That is just personal observations though and not proof of fact.<br />
<br />
Paladins in a lvl 65 dungeon group have no means of lull.  Pacify is much too low for the mobs.  Therefore you have to have a chanter or bard.  You kinda implied that paladins can lull thru, but we can't.<br />
<br />
Lastly, yes our utility is something that is good, but if it's all we had to rely on for groups it's not enough.  It's the combination of our defensive nature coupled with our utility that makes us favorable.  If we didn't have our utility we'd be worthless tanks.  If we didn't have our tanking ability, we'd be worthless for utility.  Paladins require both aspects to be viable.<br />
<br />
This in no way means that warriors should not be looked into, it's merely the reason why nerfing either aspect of paladins would in fact make them about as useless as we were in the past.  <br />
<br />
Paladins are not overpowered in any way.  What has happened is that warrior's have stagnated and are in need of some upgrades to compete with the current content.  In now way should warriors be upgraded so they are once again the only choice as tanks, but they do need upgrades so they are more able to fulfill the needs of current situations.</div></div><hr />

Bring out the nerf stick's, Pull out a paladin string him up like a pinyatta, Give the nerf bat's to some lil kid's and say go get the present's!<br />
<br />
Yes I know it has nothing to do with the conversation, But that would be a fun nerf ^-^.<br />
PS, Knights HAVE become overpowered, If you dont realize it your smoking some good shit. They can buff as much as a cleric, rezz like a cleric, They just cant heal like one &quot;YET&quot; <br />
Give those whiny bastards anther expansion and they will prolly get a 2.5k heal or 3k heal. <br />

<br />
noticed i slipped bard into it? i never said the pally lulled to the boss mob, i was showing yet ANOTHER way they work better with other classes, making them more attractive thru utility, as for veksar he can UI in if lacking a cleric or a necro that comes into play, and the res comes into play again where you cant get cloudy potions again to get past the live golems once inside or coming back to your corpse nekkid, more over you cant get any potions you brought with you to your group who have to fight their way back<br />
<br />
as for eather side narfed making you useless, that is exactly what we are now(warriors) useless unless you wana go do some old world PoS, and that old world PoS doesnt even net us some xp. wana make it fair, take down your tanking side a notch so druids and shaman cant keep you healed as well as now because you already have your handy spell book to put you on par or better with our hp and ac in the same set up, or cut down your buffs so that you cant do just as well with or with out a cleric, again making you less attractive to shaman(no free canni health) and druids(harder to time heals with less margin for error) ****this is just me being sarcastic*****<br />
<br />
ooooor you guys can just let us bitch and not get shot in the cross fire(by stepping out into and telling us to shove the holy trinity waving kunark booklets) while when most of us (including myself) are really pulling for some fair agro managment skills<br />

now for the real crap, basically warriors suck because we havent had any changes to our class, aside from sheild, that gives or takes away from what we do or how we do it, spells have added more and more power, and stuns are linked to warrior weapons to, so any across the board changes would screw the rest of the people with out EB(also ment to be a temporary fix) the true fix will come with new innate skills for warriors, coming to a SoE game near you(EQ2 EQ:AO) funny they can waste time on newbie quests, /find feature, pet buff box but they still refuse to spend any time on melee classes in the last 5 months</div></div><hr />

Pacify is much too low for the mobs. Therefore you have to have a chanter or bard. You kinda implied that paladins can lull thru, but we can't.&quot;<br />
<br />
The best pulling I've seen in all 30 or so of my LDoN adventures thus far was a paladin.<br />
<br />
He'd root one mob, we'd kill the &quot;add&quot; by the time the root broke, the &quot;add&quot; was dead enough that he'd just take on the now unrooted mob till we were done.<br />
<br />
Over. And over. And over again. It was fast, furious and efficient.<br />
<br />
/shrug<br />
<br />
But you know what ... I pull LDoN adventures a LOT. And I'd say a good 75 percent of my pulls don't involve Feign Death or really anything other than sneak or using the proper aggro/pathing tricks.<br />
<br />
Mobs in Mistmoore and Tak and Rujark are usually spaced out so well that you can avoid big trains of 5 at a time.<br />
<br />
It gets a little hairy in Guk if you're not careful. But hell, I spent enough time in the ORIGINAL guk as a youngster, that those tight spaces are just second nature.<br />
<br />
Anyways ... this has nothing to do with the topic at hand, other than to point out that YES, paladins can pull effectively in dungeons WITHOUT lull.<br />
<br />
So can monks. So can SK's. So can warriors. So can anyone with half a brain.</div></div><hr />

I see them as great off tank, i often grouped with paladin and some of them saved my ass many time by just taking agro of me when they saw a late CH, they just let me take the mob back on me since they know that even if i don't agro like them i still tank better than them.<br />

The paladin i have problems with are those who try to tank in raid just to say &quot;hey ! See i can do it !&quot; but are doing it the bad way by hiting mezable mob and just pissing off the enchanters. Those one get their ass kicked in no time by myself ^^<br />

But there is one thing you are forgetting.  Your flawless agro control.  You have two things going for you already, agro and utility.  Your tanking abilities are just under a warrior but closeing the gap fast with every expansion.  So in essence, you have 3 things that make you appealing, agro control, utility, and damn near close tanking skills to a warrior.<br />
<br />
What the point of this topic is, if your agro generation is reduced, you still have your utilities, you still can tank almost as good as a warrior, but your agro is the same as a warrior.  Then it just comes to the group to decide, is the utility worth the minor extra amount of work to keep the knight alive vs. a warrior with no utility?<br />
<br />
Not saying nerf your tanking ability, just your agro generation is a concern.  Bring knight's agro generation down to be on par with a warrior, and you have a warrior look alike with utility.</div></div><hr />

The majoirty is pretty well convinced that this is the case.   The question is what to do about it.<br />
<br />
On one hand, you can bring Paladins down to the level Warriors have been for several expansions.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, you can bring Warriors (and other pure melee for that matter) up to speed with the rest of the classes.<br />
<br />
The distance between knights and other classes that might tank if we didn't isn't that big.  Rangers and Beastlords do fine in lots of situations already for example.  By nerfing knights, you don't get three equal tanks, you get three poor tanks.  Meanwhile, casters and other hybrids will form groups without a plate tank at all.  <br />

Are knights overpowered right now? Hell yes.  They all know it whether they admit it or not.  Those that don't admit it fear the impending nerf that is most likely going to be the idiots at SOE's idea of tank balancing. Are knights any more overpowered than anyone else with a mana bar? Not really.  Bottom line, those with mana have outstripped those without in power and adaptability.  Those without mana, the pure melee, need some serious adjustments to bring them into line with everyone else.  As has been pointed out many times, nerfing knights won't help us, it'll just make sure that there are 3 plate class tanks lfg while all the casters and the non-plate hybrids keep on grouping and going full burn to kill stuff as fast as possible.</div></div><hr />

Compared to Warriors?  Sure that is because Warriors have nearly no skills to use.  A procing pet has more skills to trigger and thats random.<br />

You hit it right on the head Valeris.<br />
<br />
I have been championing this same belief and idea for a long time now.<br />
<br />
AGGRO was supposed to be BAD side-effect of spells. Paladin aggro-lock is bad. Using stun-spells to create this aggro lock, makes it even more ironic. No longer do casters even have to think, they just push buttons and cast spells. A Paladin makes aggro a no-brainer...<br />

Every class has skills and abilities to control their aggro, except, they no longer need to use them...</div></div><hr />

<br />
If the barometer of nerf-worthiness is soloing kunark dragons then you need to bear in mind that even between paladins and sks there's a substantial difference in what lets them do this (let alone the other classes that can solo them, rangers, beaslords).<br />
<br />
SKs that solo stuff like this can do it because at the very high end of gear they just break the thresholds where with focuses etc they can get the thing dead before they are 00m despite the hideous hp to mana rate on sk taps.<br />
<br />
It'll get more common but it's still something of a tour de force of gear for a sk to kill something like this.</div></div><hr />

Warriors could certainly use a few more toys to allow them to contribute more actively to the group but that's more in the realm of 'would like' than 'must have'.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">10-18-2003, 07:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;What I haven't seen is just how ppl would like knights nerfed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Funny you should ask that.<br />
<br />
Here, I swipe this from a post I made on a different board ...<br />
<br />
There are two paths to take.<br />
<br />
Path 1 ... the NERF path. This is one that will be unpopular. But, in the end would get results.<br />
<br />
A- All casters get the AAs for Combat Agility, Combat Stability and Natural Durability (as well as ID 5 and LR 5) removed and points refunded fully. These are melee AAs.<br />
<br />
B- Horses no longer regen mana at a sitting rate. This was a &quot;hook&quot; or feature of Luclin to get people to buy horses. People bought their horses already, time to move on and balance/tweak/fix/nerf this back to reality.<br />
<br />
C- Archery Mastery 3 is brought more in line, DPS wise with say, Fury of the Ages.<br />
<br />
D- Planar Durability becomes a WARRIOR only AA.<br />
<br />
E- Hybrids receive a HP % PENALTY on armors they wear, similar to how some classes get an AC modifier bonus, hybrids will now receive a penalty. So that 100 hp, 100 mana armor piece they get gives them instead 80 hp, 100 mana.<br />
<br />
F- Cease and Desist, when used on mobs over level 55 will no longer generate any aggro.<br />
<br />
G- Increase the resist rates on Lull and Pacify to something a bit more similar to Feign Death Failures. ORIGINALLY, these spells were worthless because they were ressisted far too much. Now they're overpowering because they're not resisted much at all. Bring it in line with FD ... and MANY monks can relate a ton of tales for how FD fails at the wrong time ... always ... or how they can rack up 5 or more FD failures in a row.<br />
<br />
H- Decrease the range on spells so that even with max focus effects, etc., casters still have to &quot;feel the love&quot; of some combat situations.<br />
<br />
Boy, none of these ideas seem too popular do they?<br />
<br />
And yet, they'd make the game MORE CHALLENGING ... AND ... they'd fix the obvious lack of balance.<br />
<br />
ORRRRRR ... we could go another direction ... and fix melees by BOOSTING them, or enhancing them, allowing them to compete better.<br />
<br />
A- Give melees INCREASED defensive efficiency either through a second tier of AAs in the defensive line (CA/LR, the HP boost of the durabilities, CS/ID) ... or give PURE melees a higher percentage increase from these AAs.<br />
<br />
B- Give horses a MELEE benefit of some sort, thus INCREASING the hook of mounts. Wizards riding through the lands casting spells from horses doesn't hold as much of a fantasy image as a warrior riding through the field of battle, polearm at the ready.<br />
<br />
C- Give monks and rogues some sort of DPS increase to keep them competitive with the likes of trigger happy casters and arrow happy rangers.<br />
<br />
D- Give warriors an ADDITIONAL durability AA, making the gap between hybrid plate wearers and warriors larger, like it SHOULD be.<br />
<br />
E- Pure melees receive a HP increase for the mana present on their items. Everyone says 1 for 1, which is obviously far too much. But make it a percentage. So that when a melee equips a 100/100 item, they get 125 or 110 hit points out of the deal, since that 100 mana isn't doing them any good.<br />
<br />
F- FIX WARRIOR TAUNT ABILITIES. So that the presence of cease/desist or just regular old chain aggro spells (like snare) doesn't make warriors completely gimp.<br />
<br />
G- If Lull and FM and Pacify are going to be the PREFERRED way to &quot;pull&quot; then give monks, first, an ESCAPE like ability, so that they can clear aggro every now and then without using /q ... and give monks a new role. Like MELEE FROM EVERY ANGLE ... like say giving them an innate Strikethrough or TM or whatever ... and make Dragon Punch much more reliable for mob positioning.<br />
<br />
H- Increase the viability of melees on ranged fights.<br />
<br />
AND make melee focus effects actually viable. All the posts/threads/parses I've seen on the much ballyhooed melee focus effects are disappointing at best, infuriating at worst.<br />
<br />
Sooooo ... which path do the players want? I'd say people favor ENHANCEMENTS over the nerf bat. But imo, the nerfbat could do the job just as well too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So it's pretty easy to see why many Warriors have jumped on the beat the Paladins with the nerf stick train.  Because if Warriors can't be improved without Paladins getting in a tizzy, we might as well really give them something to get their panties in a wad over.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hmm, where to start. <br />
Personally I am not for out and out nerfs, except for all but one of my ideas, I think they would call them stealth nerfs.<br />
<br />
1.) FIX SPELL AGGRO -- ITS broken on a couple lines of spells. FIX IT.<br />
    a.) STUNS - Give STUNS a HARD CAP on casting. Do not allow a 9th level spell cast on a 50th level mob<br />
    b.) SNARES - lower the aggro on these some.<br />
    c.) SLOWS - resisted slow seems to be the highest aggro in the game, lower it some.<br />
    d.) IMMUNE SPELLS - 1 hate from the immune part of a spell<br />
    e.) RESISTED SPELLS - 1/2 hate from the spell<br />
    f.) MITIGATED SPELL - % equal to the mitigation factor.<br />
<br />
2.) FIX TAUNT -- Its Broken, everyone knows it.(this would ALSO benefit Knights)<br />
    a.) success rate<br />
    b.) success/fail message<br />
    c.) range<br />
<br />
3.) ADD WARRIOR ONLY TAUNT<br />
    a.) seperate time than normal taunt<br />
    b.) Generate a specific amount of GUARANTEED hate<br />
    c.) INNATE ABILITY<br />
    d.) RANGED USAGE<br />
<br />
4.) FIX MITIGATION<br />
    a.) Boost warrior Mitigation by minimum 10% (it says everywhere we are the best at mitigation, make it noticeable)<br />
    b.) STOP ALL PLATE, ALL/ALL, ALL Melee Itemization. <br />
    c.) Boost stats on melee only equipment to compensate for extra mana/stats/focus of similar hybrid/caster gear<br />
<br />
5.) HPS<br />
    a.) MANA = HPs<br />
    b.) ADVANCED BODY AA for PURE MELEE only - stats to 355 str,sta,agil,dex<br />
    c.) Make melee stats over 255 worthwhile, no more diminishing returns.<br />
    <br />
6.) SKILLS<br />
    a.) Increase all warrior combat skills to MAX<br />
    b.) increase stat caps to 305<br />
<br />
7.) DPS    <br />
    a.) Off-hand damage bonus - this is a must<br />
    b.) move warriors to the highest monk damage table<br />
    c.) move rogues up one table (they have good dps as it is)<br />
    d.) move monks up a lil higher than they are now.<br />
    e.) fix itemization - warriors should be able to use all weapons, except diety specific<br />
<br />
8.) AA's<br />
    a.) give warriors a few more usefull AA's <br />
    b.) FIX WARCRY - it useless as is<br />
    c.) FIX RAMPAGE - make these useful abilities, they sound cool, but have such etreme limited use<br />
    d.) Give us a headshot type AA<br />
    e.) Give us a ranged aggro AA  <br />
    f.) WARHORSE AA! <br />
<br />
9.) Discipline<br />
    a.) Unhook timers<br />
    b.) use spell gems for discs<br />
    c.) add more disciplines, quested/eth/spec parch drops<br />
    d.) adjust timers - duration and reset<br />
<br />
10.) Utility<br />
    a.) Give all pure melee, esp warriors some type of utilty.<br />
    b.) Weapon Styles<br />
    c.) Weapon Focus Effects<br />
    d.) Style Focus Effects</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeka</div><div class="date">10-19-2003, 01:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As for the idea that the &quot;throttle&quot; for Casters is tank &quot;tauntablity&quot;, let me just say if this is what the designers consider they must be really silly.  Even in the original content it was a question of mana pool: the best way to spend the limited amount of resource you can.  Of course it has been beaten into the ground that this has so dramatically changed with super large mana pools (even on Hybrids!) and super mana regeneration.<br />
<br />
This is yet another Melee Tactic vs Caster Tactic problem.  The Caster throttle disappeared.  The Melee throttle is still very much here.  Tank usefulness only came into play when Casters where unfettered by their mana pool.<br />
<br />
As for the tired idea that you need to nerf someone to gain something, *sigh*.  Sometimes it is necessary but I still don't see this as the case.  You do not need to nerf anyone to improve Warriors.  Although I think the reason why nothing is done yet is because they are afraid to step outside of the box.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Partha</div><div class="date">10-19-2003, 01:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In the early days, it was a question of mana pool.<br />
<br />
 In today's game, it's a question of aggro control.<br />
<br />
 Otherwise, Knights would STILL be out of jobs.<br />
<br />
 Since aggro control IS the question, the way to balance is to give everyone RELATIVELY equal aggro control, balanced against their tankablity.<br />
<br />
 SK's, since they can't self-HP buff/heal (and don't mention lifetaps) and are more fragile than tanks, get better aggro control. That's a tradeoff.<br />
<br />
 Warriors, since they are the most durable tank and can't self-HP buff/heal, should have aggro control smaller than an SK, but not distinctly less.<br />
<br />
 Paladins, since they are the SECOND most durable tank, and CAN self-HP Buff AND heal, should have the worst aggro control, but once again, not distinctly less than Warriors.<br />
<br />
 Right now, Paladin's have as fine an aggro control ability as SK's. That's not balanced.<br />
<br />
 And if giving Warriors the SAME aggro control as the other two breaks content, there's really only one option.<br />
<br />
 (And please, no more 'think outside the box' nonsense unless you've got CONCRETE ideas and are willing to spell them out for the Warrior community.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is entirely possible that you see a different game than I do.  The game I see shows how strong mana really is compared melee.  It is embarrasingly bad how wide the gap is.  And yet all you see is how Knights are better than you.  It is sad your vision is so clouded... <br />

Frankly there is no where else melee can go.  &quot;Basic melee&quot; has been stretched to the break down point.

Even in the original content it was a question of mana pool: the best way to spend the limited amount of resource you can. Of course it has been beaten into the ground that this has so dramatically changed with super large mana pools (even on Hybrids!) and super mana regeneration.<br />
<br />
<br />
Give me a break - exactly why do you think there is an aggro cost on a spell if it's not a form of limitation? Aggro has always been a 'throttle control' on spellcasting. Yet you still tell me that bypassing the aggro system with trivial ease is in line with game mechanics?<br />
<br />
Bullshit. Self serving bullshit.<br />
<br />
As for the tired idea that you need to nerf someone to gain something, *sigh*. Sometimes it is necessary but I still don't see this as the case. You do not need to nerf anyone to improve Warriors.<br />
<br />
If anything is a demonstration of how upgrades (without proper care to ensure balance in the games mechanics) messes things up the Caster improvements are it. But your answer appears to be to just layer more and more upgrades on to try and rectify a  already unbalanced situation because the possibility that, just perhaps, something IS overpowerful and needs to be trimmed back is not politically correct enough for you.<br />
 <br />
If something is not working correctly then you change it, you don't boost another class to similar levels of brokeness game mechanics wise so they can compete and stick your head in the sand (well, SoE might :p). <br />
<br />
<br />
And before we go over the same tired arguement - YES 'tauntability' for all tanks needs to be 'higher' than unassisted warrior taunt at this time, but NO it does NOT need to bypass the aggro system (and the risk of lost aggro from careless spellcasting) as comprehensively as it does currently with a knight.</div></div><hr />

 Casters have ALWAYS had options to solo, except for clerics. What Knights enable is for Casters to maintain higher power levels than Warriors. This is NOT acceptable. So either you GIVE Warriors the ability, REDUCE the Knight's ability, or LOWER Caster power levels.<br />

I trust what casters say, and casters say there's an aggro cap which prevents them from acheiving their potential.<br />
<br />
Things like this:<br />

<br />
Actually, i disagree, its the best mana/damage nuke wizards get that still has a resist bonus. Now, i dont know about time, and Furor could answer you, but in the rest of PoP, and god forbind even farming VT, we use SK tanks whenever we can, and our wizards ignore Concussion.<br />
<br />
a wizard without AA can sustain 312DPS until oom at a 4.2 to 1 ratio with a SK tank. our current best wizard sustains 500DPS, at about a 4.4 to 1 ratio, an can cast about 16 SOSes chained. (on horse)<br />
<br />
So assuming time precludes the use of SK tanks, your left with warriors, and your forced to lower your DPS. The only advantage to the legs is its instant refresh allowing you to get more hate reduction in between nukes. If your a excellent wizard, which I assume teh ealyer posting wizards are, it allows you to click 3 times and then SOS agian, sustaining about 300DPS. This isnt bad since my current best with a warrior tanking is about 180DPS. (end luclin~early pop agro/proc weapons)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It is entirely possible that you see a different game than I do. The game I see shows how strong mana really is compared melee. It is embarrasingly bad how wide the gap is. And yet all you see is how Knights are better than you. It is sad your vision is so clouded... <br />
<br />
What is sad is that there's not a real balance between melee and mana, one that developers of video games who have testicles are willing to stand behind.   It's a really simple concept that the weak minded at SOE are incapable of implementing and standing behind.<br />
<br />
1. Pure melee should be best at melee, both offensive and defensive, by a margin that is noticeable.<br />
<br />
2. Pure casters should be best at casting, of all types by a margin that is noticeable.<br />
<br />
3. Those who use both melee and mana should derive REAL strength from the merging of the two, not by being &quot;super close in one, and only lagging a little behind on the other.&quot;<br />
<br />
The real problem is the willingness of SOE to not redefine the *merged classes* who being functional and versatile should draw strength from their versatility, with real strengths that are EXCLUSIVE to them and the merging of melee and mana.   <br />
<br />
The 'real&quot; problem isn't that warriors haven't evolved into knights and I resent the implication that they should.    The &quot;real' problem is that SOE is unwilling to find another role for the various &quot;merged&quot; classes and have shoved them into the realm where pure melee should be.<br />
<br />
<br />
Frankly there is no where else melee can go. &quot;Basic melee&quot; has been stretched to the break down point. Shall I point out the fact that all Hybrids and Casters gain more from melee focus effects than Warriors? So you will forgive me if I think staying inside of the box will help.<br />

The only reasonable ones with a realistic 'change of role&quot; arent' melee, but merged classes.</div></div><hr />

The problem isn't that Warriors are in a box. It's that SoE moved Paladins in and gave (and gave and gave) them the tools to take the box over. Mana Pool penalty? Gone. HP's? You got em. Tank/ALL armor dripping with mana? FT? Focus items? Big 2Hdrs? Aego? 90% res? Unique group buff? Level 9 stun costing 15 mana with good aggro at level 65? Anything you want and more (looks nervous).<br />
<br />
All Warriors have left is MTing the few raid and named mobs that &quot;require&quot; Defensive and groups that need a tank to get started - any tank, ya even a Warrior. And on PoN some Paladins have their eye on Defensive too.<br />
<br />
Warrior = The Tank<br />
Paladin = a tank with spells<br />
<br />
As Warriors start to measure their power vs. Paladins it is rapidly becoming clear that we are not where we should be. The current state of Warriors is WRONG and there's a LOT of improvements or nerfing (wouldn't be prudent) or both needed to set things right.<br />
<br />
Suggesting utility for Warriors as a substitute for setting things right is only intended to preserve the advantages Paladins have gained over the last 2 years. It was transparent the first time you proposed it and its transparent now. I'm pretty sure that it would not make Warriors very happy if it were attempted and SoE would be well advised to do the right thing.<br />

And we come full circle again.<br />
<br />
If warrior is the only reasonable choice for a tank, what is there for a paladin to do?  Think about it... if a warrior tank is head and shoulders above a paladin as tank then the warrior will be MT and ST and they can be stacked in any situation where you want more tanking power.<br />

<br />
 Paladins now make acceptable XP tanks. Yes?<br />
<br />
 Retuning stuns like I've suggested doesn't make them Kunarkians again, no matter WHAT you think. I know, you know, all the casters with brains not between their legs know that if you get a Paladin, he's tough enough to tank for your XP groups and brings bonuses as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is from one of the casters when presented with a topic of how to improve our raids, among the many sugestions, this one caught my attention the most:<br />
<br />
Use pally MA's more. I know it sucks for warriors but the fact is the pallies can sometimes aggro lock better on the trash mobs. The quicker we can take them down, the better, and I know from testing I can DPS faster/harder with a pally on a mob than a warrior. If you are pissed off about this (and I would be) blame SOE - hopefully it will get fixed. But a pally stunning = me chain nuking with no consequence. Multiply that by 10 wizards and a slew of rangers and rogues and stuff dies faster. Warriors = great MT's because of AC and mitigation and disc - Pallys = clear shit fast.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Pretty much the big tanks are used when Defensive is required on a big boss.  This is what I usually see during my raid time.<br />
<br />
No one in EXP groups gives a rats ass if warrior has 500 more hp or defensive. The casters mostly care for the aggro control of the tank, same goes for clearing yardtrash during raids(which is 90% of the raid time, the other 10% is killing the boss). Right now warriors are at the rock bottom unless defensive is a requirement.<br />
<br />
People who look for a tank in exp groups know 2 things:<br />
 <br />
1)ALL Knights have reliable aggro and its innate(part of their spells, its not in their gear).  Knights have control over their aggro and Hate generation.<br />
2) Not all Warriors have EB weapons and warriors have no control over their procs. Warrior aggro generation is totally random. <br />
<br />
You can hardly tell a difference when healing similar equiped warrior and knight. At least clerics in my guild dont complain that their mana hurt when the paladin is MTing with 400 hp less than the top warrior. <br />
<br />
If knights had the same aggro generation of warriors(Taunt and  random procs), all casters would once again be forced to control their aggro and play knowing there will be dire consequences if they are sloppy.  <br />
<br />
But this is not the case. If knights having total control over aggro generation, PLUS having tankability similar to warriors, is not gamebreaking. Then by all means warriors with aggro generation abilities similar to knights would not be game breaking either. <br />
<br />
If it is, then what is the solution? Nerf knight aggro so the 3 tank classes are equal tanking choices(all requiring work from raid/group to keep aggro). OR simply nerf aggro generation from the pure casters so that the  aggro generation of knights is not required to 'kill shit fast' with no consequence. Just like defensive is not needed in killing yardtrash in raids or exp mobs.<br />
<br />
Every class with a mana bar gets new spells with every expansion(even if some suck). Warriors have not even gotten new crappy disciplines for lvl 61-65. Not even the refresh timers for the old disciplines improved as we leveled up. <br />
<br />
Warrior class has been neglected hardcore.</div></div><hr />

In the current expansion, there's plenty for paladins to do when not tanking.<br />
<br />
Offtanking adds. Root parking adds. Pulling (paladins are pretty good at pulling, even level 65 paladins are pretty good at pulling normal adventures). Group heals. Even some good old fashioned attacking the mob and helping to kill it.<br />

Of course, a warrior can also add tank and do some pulling too, and their DPS is also welcome when it comes to killing monsters.<br />

The Warrior Class Description specifically notes that Warriors have unmatched survivability and can make themselves the focus all their enemies attacks. And this isn't just marketing - in the game this is virtually all Warriors have to offer.<br />
If hybrids could cast spells as well as their parent class, then nobody would really want to play that parent class. - Absor<br />

<br />
  Lets look at a hypothetical situation.  Assume that warriors get equal taunt as paladins and a new mitigation table and a slight boost for hp/ac.  Taunt was changed by adding 200 range to it and hate on it regardless of success or failure.  Mitigation was increased so that a warrior with max defensive AA's will mitigate 10% better and one with no AA's will mitigate 15% better then knights.  Hp/AC is innately increased so that in equivalent gear a warrior is no less then 800 hp more and no more then 1500 hp more then a paladin.   Pure melee receive a DPS boost so that rogues do 15% more dps, monks are doing 20% and warriors are at 20% more then current (don't get absorbed in those numbers, mainly I'm just showing the dps needs increased and warriors will be part of that).  Lastly, lets assume that wpns are fixed so that riposted is no longer an issue with dual wield.<br />
<br />
All of those sound reasonable and for the most part are needed changes.<br />
<br />
The question I'm asking is, if such changes were to be made, what does a paladin offer an exp group (pop and ldon).  <br />
<br />
Paladin as MT isn't smart because a warrior has the same agro, but better mitigation.<br />
<br />
Paladin as ST isn't smart because a warrior has the same agro and better mitigation.  A paladin could root an add, but while that is happening he's taking more damage then a warrior moving the add to the side for a party member to root.<br />
<br />
Paladin as dps isn't smart because pure melee have more dps then paladins.<br />
<br />
A paladin is a better puller then a warrior, then again, with monks getting a boost to dps why not take one of them?  Take a monk and an extra warrior if your worried about a need to off tank or for pulls.  Not to mention you have much higher dps then you would if you took a paladin and a dps class.  Heck as has been stated here a ranger/monk can tank ldon long enough for mobs to be mezzed so why bother with the extra tank at all.<br />
<br />
<br />
  If the changes that I listed are done the paladin class, while not nerfed, would be unneeded.  Group heals are nice, but there is no content that makes them necessary.  Roots, stuns and Brell's line of buffs are nice, but not necessary, or else they can be cast by another class.  The ability to res is nice, but a necro can do it also if you don't have a cleric and the necro is a safer bet with FD.<br />
<br />
  My point here is that if warriors have equal taunt/agro as paladins, the paladin class will be unneeded.  The trade off is supposed to be better mitigation/lesser agro or better agro/lesser mitigation.  Groups should choose based on their makeup and their style.  Currently paladins have too much mitigation to go with their agro, or conversely, warriors have too little mitigation in comparison to their agro.  One or the other.<br />
<br />
  The balance point is adjusting the two classes so both have equal appeal to a group while doing so with seperate abilities.  Making one class hands down the best choice for tank will handicap the other one.<br />
<br />
  I could discuss the descriptions and how they can't apply to both raid and exp group, but I really have to head to work now.</div></div><hr />

The aggro vs. durability arguement has NEVER worked to peoples satisfaction on either side of the coin.

<br />
Warriors are pretty much a two trick horse... they tank and they do some damage.  You an expand their abilities by weapon procs, but then your relying on the RNG.  However, the RNG is countered by the variety of procs warriors have available.<br />
<br />
Warriors need to have AA's looked at and disciplines looked at and revamped with the idea of giving them some options on damage dealing and the option of hitting more then just one disc.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh, and your right about before PoP.  Knights were a bit too weak on taking damage.  Only the best equipped knights had the stats to be effective.  PoP brought the increase in level and the AA's that allow a paladin to tank effectively.  The downside is these abilities didn't keep the warrior in parity.  One was moved up along with content and one didn't move along far enough.<br />

Thing is aggro is crucial with mobs that can provide a challenge to Tanks of the post PoP era. They really have to hit as hard as they do or any bugger can tank them (see ldoN normal). Unless knights go back to being unable to tank efficiently, aggro will remain more important than durability. There is no durability balancer against a 'sure thing' (knight aggro) unless were talking a massive difference which would be in my opinion be equally unbalanced, not to mention that with mana pools as they now are conservation of healing power is less of a factor in tank choice (certainly when comparing plate tanks).</div></div><hr />

Yes, Akea is right. IF Warriors were &quot;fixed&quot; in their basic ability to tank competatively in today's slow on incoming or fast kill pull 5-mobs experiance environments then features beyond simple survivability will be needed. Perhaps burst damage by shortening the Agressive discipline refresh, etc. There's a whole lot of things that could be done. But without competative aggro control it would be meaningless.<br />
<br />
Warriors, Paladins, and Shadow Knights SHOULD have differences, but sufficient survivability and aggro control to be desired in experiance groups are not where those differences should appear.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trilith</div><div class="date">10-20-2003, 07:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First, I'd like to ask you to forgive my low (heh, very low) post count when entering this conversation, I've just recently started reading these boards and am not simply trolling to push my agenda.<br />
<br />
That being said, I can see both sides here, perhaps because I have experence from both sides of the spectrum: A tank looking for a group and a caster looking for a tank.  I can see the parity in tanking classes going a few ways: (1) All tanks having relatively similiar ability when it comes to taking damage and holding agro and then letting additional skills decide the merits of the individual classes, (2) Tanking ability and Agro ability work inversely according to class (Ie, the better you are at one, the worse you are at the other) yet all tanks retaining the minium level of both necessary to be a viable option in a group, (3) One class dominating the others.<br />
<br />
Personally, I prefer option 2.  Right now, I am willing to admit that 3 is the percieved reality, and as a former mage... I am fully aware that percieved reality is sometimes (read usually) more important then actual reality.  The truth is, atleast as far as I can tell, that the tanks are relatively aligned according to option 2 (obviously not completely).  By this, I mean on merit of the classes themselves, without thought to any outside factors (and yes, I am fully aware that outside factors need to be accounted for in the final analasys) the tanking classes are relatively balanced (again, not completely).  The general population sees Knights as vastly superior in the end though, and that is a key problem I am well aware with.  Actual balance is irrelevant in the face of percieved imbalance.  This is a problem every type of class has encountered and it is somewhat difficult to combat without large changes or proof to the countrary.  <br />
<br />
I will simply try to address some of the problems that I have seen from both directions.  Itemization is , in fact, off.  However, I view this as more of a tank vs others issue then a warrior vs knight one-though both exist.  Lets face it, you cannot make the itemization problem a warrior only one without hurting the other tank classes.  This is because, if you make items in such a way that you change them only to increase a warrior's relative use from them without changing the surrounding content, its useless.  Is having 20k hp really all that impressive when 10k is more then sufficient to do the job?  However, If you fix *warrior* gear so that 20k is important while the rest remain unchanged, knights lose viability as tanks.  Therefore, you have to maintain a *relative* parity between tank itemization while also making the difference between tank and non tank gear important.  <br />
<br />
I have long been of the belief that spells should be seen and treated as regular items, that they are in fact part of the itemization problem-though from a different angle.  As a mage, I saw no reason why my damage spells should be treated as different then, say, a rogues daggers.  Upgrading those spells should be akin to upgrading items.  The real answer to alot of melee/caster discrepencies is in this fault.  If jumping from being a level 60 VT caster to a level 65 time caster were as difficult( in all areas) as the difficulty in going from a level 60 vt melee to a level 65 time melee, there would be fewer complaints, I think.  The problem is, it is not.  And it is not the fault of the spells, but the way they are introduced.  As I have been talking in generalities, let me clarify according to the current topic...<br />
<br />
Let us say, that warriors recieve part of what they want.  Warrior gear is noticibaly better then knight gear, yet not so much as to invalidate knights as tanks.  The faulty implimentation of how classes aquire the tools to hold agro would still be a problem.  I feel that the basic premise of the current tools is sound, taunt for all tanks, with warriors utilizing agro weapons while knights use spells.  I believe this is good because each have strengths and weaknesses.  The problem is in how each class gets agro ability.  Warriors need to get high end weapons, knights need readily available spells.  If comparable knight agro spells dropped in a similiar way to warrior agro weapons, the problems between the lower end players would be diminished.  And, in this like in regular armor, high agro weapons should not be available to knights.  <br />
<br />
As for spells in general, I'd like to be perfectly honest.  Paladins get groups for two and only two spells: Stun and Rez.  Stun because of agro and rez IF you are using a druid/shaman healer.  I can guarentee you, while other spells may be good, these are the two you compete with, not the others.  On an average day, I use my heals mostly on myself to make up for a healers inability to do a good job, and not always to success.  And for buffs, generally Aura and Brells are the important ones, and they simply make up for my lower hp/ac compared to a comparable warrior.  <br />
Now, notice... Idealy, knight spells make up for their poorer itemization and warrior itemization makes up for a lack of spells.  This would create a parity between similiarly geared players.  So, if itemization was fairly done between both spells and gear, you would wind up with similiar tanks (who could all do the job) with slightly different strong/weak areas.  <br />
<br />
The real problem I think, is perception (not necessarily of facts, but of place).  What exactly is wrong with knights being a preferred offtank, if a warrior is maintained as the preferred main tank?  What is wrong with knights being used to clear &quot;trash&quot;?  And what is wrong with knights having slightly (yes, I know there is not a slight difference at the moment, but many voice the opinion that warriors should have the best period) better agro control?  The problem, I think, is warriors feel they should be the best tanks-period.  They include best at agro control in this too.  This thinking seems to stem from a slight hypocrisy of how people view hybrids.  Warriors say that all tanking ability is derived from them, therefore they should always be better then a &quot;hybrid&quot;, yet never bother to look at where a knights ability really stems from.  Warriors can justify being better at all melee aspects.  Better damage absorption, better damage dealing and better taunt-the specific skill.  However, knight agro does not stem from warriors, it comes from necros/clerics.  A necro or cleric can generate much more agro then a warrior and have passed that on to knights.  The ability goes like this:<br />
Tanking-<br />
Warrior&gt;knight&gt;cleric/necro<br />
Agro-<br />
cleric/necro&gt;knight&gt;warrior<br />
<br />
That flow and the implications seem pretty fair to me, as long as they aren't overexaggerated tot he point that either aspect is completely dominated by one class.  If a knight doesn't derive an ability from a warrior, why should they be limited by a warrior and not the class it derives from.  Otherwise, the logical flow is that:<br />
Tanking-<br />
Warrior&gt;cleric/necro&gt;knight<br />
Agro-<br />
Warrior&gt;cleric/necro&gt;knight<br />
<br />
And what good is such a class?  While I am aware this is not what warriors want, it IS the logical flow of the ideas being presented.  It is not the way to balance the tank classes.  <br />
<br />
In a different way, this applies to gear aswell...  If knights/non-tanks are to suffer penalties on all/all gear (or simply not allowed to have the best tank gear), does it not logically follow that warriors suffer penalities (if not simply being denied complete access to) in regards to the best weapons?  I do believe that the former is important to have, but do not forget that extremes are a bitch and can bite you in the ass.  The old concept of hybrids needs to stay dead.  Instead, it should simply be a matter of three classes trying to do the same thing through slightly different means, and all succeeding  to the same general degree.</div></div><hr />

Once into the fight with some procs going, I have very little trouble with agro.  It's that pre-slow beginning where things aren't working well.<br />

Pally's would still have &quot;range agro&quot; on us, but I could live without that if need be.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Since I don't have a BoW I only need 2 augments. Lessee, that's about 1900AP's just to get what I should already have in aggro control. I have 600AP's already in Miragul's and 300 in DGuK despite the fact Knights are more effective there (sitting in Everfrost and giving a /tell to every Cleric that zones in sometimes gets me a group after they do it the first time, their Knight MT drops, and they want to do it again).<br />
<br />
While I'm improving my aggro, I suppose Knights will get a 40 HP aug to help close that massive &quot;Warrior 20% HP advantage&quot; and take their 2H DPS weapon with a damage proc, add Force of YKesha for a second DD proc, buff it with Pious Might for a third, and get an Enchanter to Pumpkinize them for a forth. That should help a little in closing that &quot;Warrior 20% DPS advantage&quot; especially in DGuk, Mirauls, and MM.<br />
<br />
Good advice.<br />
<br />
Trilith<br />
Paladin = 99.9875% Warrior + 70% Cleric<br />
<br />
That being the case (check out the aggro, HP, and DPS threads) restoring the old Hybrid concept is exactly what is needed. But instead of nerfing Knights, Pre-PoTime Warriors just need a separate mitigation table, 20% more HP's (to restore the HP advantage we don't have), and a 2H 54/48 (better would be nice) EB/TB weapon that drops as frequently as Windblade.<br />

<br />
You've all heard it before---&gt; provided the war is pulling (not likely) or the war can get agro from the puller (which should not be a problem if he/she is pulling with arrows), in my experience the extra oomph in HPs and AC generally makes up for the lack of immediate slows.  Of course that requires the casters to actually pay attention in an exp grp lol.  Now, factor in 4 procs firing off left and right - agro is easily gained and maintained.    NTM what else are ya gonna stick in the pre-LDON weapon augment slots?  +6 to disease?  not likely.....<br />
<br />
I recently grouped in LDON with a war who had 4 procs.  I didn't know this at the time the group was assembled, so I was expecting to be MT and he'd be add control.  But much to my delight I quickly relinquished MT duties when he linked his double proc-augmented weapons.  He got agro fast and kept it flawlessly throughout the entire run.  Even when the 1st mob died, he'd come over to the mob I was offtanking and steal agro like it was nothing - most impressive I must say.</div></div><hr />

Very good insight....kinda ties into what Hulkling is trying to say (behind his abrasion).<br />
<br />
The +agro mods are a good thing...BUT they benefit folks at 65 more as to aquire a 1600-1700ish pts set of 2x mods is a more achievable goal.<br />

However, I like the quoted posters arugument: why is so much harder for a warr to get a CHSD/BoC etc than a Pallie to buy a stun spell and both achieve the same agro?</div></div><hr />

You don't have the same urgency in buying guidance, a spell universally derided by Paladins gamewide as warriors do to perform a vital function that is CORE to your CORE role.   <br />

Or you could kill Rhag 1 (easily 1 groupable, and I'd argue 2-boxable), or collect 2 research componenets and have a wizard combine them.    Or right click your ornate BP twice, or simply turn in a parchment for Crusader's Touch and cast it twice.<br />

Yeah, I have a 50DD proc that I bought for 30AP.   Of course, it's meaningless and does nothing for aggro, but it's cheap.   There's tons of spells that you could buy for 150AP too but you can't scribe them, or they wont' do you any good either, but hell why is relevancy an issue?  I mean YOU don't seem to care about relevancy.<br />
<br />

No, actually, they didn't.   They gave the opportunity to purchase an increase in frequency of random events.    Random events are the ANTITHESIS of control.   <br />
<br />
I often hear the mantra that &quot;Utility doesn't get knights groups&quot;, but I will be so bold as to say that no one has ever gotten a group because of an augment.<br />
<br />
Augments don't get warriors groups.   Of course with your vested interest in staying on top, it's easy to sit back and accuse people of 'pissing and moaning' rather than looking into the real issues.</div></div><hr />

Here's Hulking helping warriors solve their problems:<br />

If you can't afford to spend 1150 on top of the line agro, there are a TON of other DD procs from every dungeon for as low as 150 - get them while they're hot! And as a warrior you very well know, DD procs adds a ton of agro.<br />

<br />
Have had Anger II on a BoC and Strike of YKesha on a SeM for weeks. Does it help? Ya, some.<br />
<br />
Imagine you are weilding a Jeldorin and buff it with Divine Might. Do you get a proc early in every fight without fail?  Do you get 3 or 4 procs every fight? Well imagine that every time it proc'd it was the Cease Spell you get at level 9 except that it doesn't interrupt the mob.<br />
<br />
Ya know how you stun on incoming? Warriors can't do that. Stun when you see an aggro producing spell cast by a group member?  Warriors can't do that. Stun to hold aggro? Stun when the mob starts running? Stun if the mob starts to gate? Stun to build up aggro on the mezed mob? Stun to interrupt it's spell casting? Stun just because you like to see the particle effect and ya can?<br />
<br />
Warriors get a Taunt button that only works if you're in melee range of the mob and then only half the time with no message telling you if anything happened, random procs, and the mighty mighty AE Taunt.<br />
<br />
So go ahead, tell Warriors to get those aggro augs. They are probably the best item in LDoN for us. Instead of being smugly patronizing, you should be grateful that the only two things you didn't get from Warriors are Defensive (the Kiss of Death) and Warrior aggro control.<br />

<br />
Yeah I know I'm being a dickhead, so I'll tone it down in order for everyone to understand my point.<br />
<br />
I already stated that I agree that &quot;immediate&quot; agro is a problem for wars (which would include agro on incoming) that cannot be fixed by procs, so thats a moot point we agree on.   Which also goes with your question of whether or not I always get an early proc in the fight - no I don't.  But even with a 2 hander and 1 proc, yes I get 3 or 4 procs a fight.  And more if I'm using  the faster 1h + shield. <br />
<br />
As far as my proc being cease, I guess I'm not following you, cuz cease is the exact spell I (and most pallies) use on incoming mobs of any level to gain immediate agro.  For agro purposes that would rock.......<br />
<br />
However most of that, as well as most of all the various points made in the above posts, is irrelavent.  We could banter back and forth about dps/hitpoint gap/cost of procs/utility/stuns/blah/blah/blah till the cows come home and get no where:<br />
<br />
The heart of the matter is increased agro for warriors to produce a balance (or the more unfavorable option by the majority of both parties to nerf knights) - in order for wars to be more efficient in exp groups.  Thus not being overlooked in favor of a knight.  Correct?<br />
<br />
Whit the release of PoP, knights were not instantly made the tank of choice.  People had it beat into their brains that knights were a waste of mana - and it was true.  Over a course of several months, people slowly came to realize the value of a knight's agro.  Eventually it became universally known that we are more efficient and safer to have as MT for exp groups, but by no means did this happen over night.<br />
<br />
Which brings us to the current situation at hand.  I completely agree with Romidar's artical (linked in the opening post of this thread) in that a balance is needed.  Whether it be some innate/AA/disc ability given to warriors for more agro, or/and specialized itemization to bring back the original gap in HPs and AC.  But thats where he stopped.<br />
<br />
Enter LDON:  Instead of an innate (or AA or disc) agro abitlity as many suggest would solve the problem, wars now have the option available to all levels and/or guild status to increase agro through itemization. <br />
<br />
Which brings us to my original 4 proc point.  How many of you have 4 procs?  How many of you have even 2 procs for that matter?  I've seen 1st hand at what 4 procs can do.  That particual war was proccing left and right  and stole agro from me with no effort whatsoever.   It was frikkin amazing.  I have no doubt in my mind his 4 procs were the sole reason he was able to do what he did.  I find it hard to believe that anyone can dispute that additional procs will not add enough agro to make a huge difference.  As I said 3 sentences ago.....I've seen it 1st hand.<br />
<br />
You all know what procs are better agro and which are not.  LDON has almost any proc you want, including but not limited to Life Taps, DD, DoT, and most importanly - pure agro Hate.  I could individually list every proc available in LDON, how much they cost, and what the effect is, but woe to the warrior who has not already researched this.  I could also list all the high end (high end being relative of course to your guild raid status) Bazaar purchasable warrior weapons with existing procs, but again, woe to the warrior.........  I could also list easy raid targets that have nodrop proc and/or hate proc warrior weapons, but once again.......<br />
<br />
LDON has provided the means for wars to significantly increase their agro abilities to once again be competitive for exp group tanks.  Is it free? no.  Do you have to make some effort to obtain better agro? you bet.  Should you already have this ability? thats argueable (per Absor).  <br />
<br />
Try 4 procs (good ones btw - velium shards don't count lol).  I guarantee you won't be disappointed.  However, let me say this:  Just as the Knights in PoP, people have it beat into their brains that wars make lousy epx group tanks - your credibility as the tank of choice will not return over night.   As more and more warriors realize the value of mulitple procs and obtain them, you will begin to see the much needed change we all desire.<br />
<br />
Is this the final solution needed for ultimate balance?  Nope.  But its a huge step in the right direction by SOE that has been severely overlooked and/or ignored by almost everyone.  Take advantage and utilize the oportunities given to you.<br />
<br />

Throw in all the little nitpicky beefs you got that every class has, but last time I checked the problem at hand was warrior agro.  Period.  If you are inferring that multiple procs DOES ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to help your situation then you need to take some serious warrior lessons.<br />

The fact that you have made several misstatements regarding  aggro generation, as well as durability indicates to me that you know very little about the issue, but then to make matters worse, it's NOT that you know very little, you know EXACTLY what the issues are in that you stated that you conceded that the two most glaring balance issues when it comes to aggro have nothing to do with increasing the frequency of random events, but with real control both up close and at a range.   You yourself have stated that you know this to be the case.   You know that when taunt fails, you as a knight have an alternative other than &quot;hope&quot;.   You have an action that YOU can perform which compensates.   This is part 1 of the big balance issue.   Part 2 is the durability spread being not only far too small, but in many cases comes out in favor of the Paladin when fighting mobs that are stunnable.   <br />

 But they have become vastly louder after LDON was released when there were no apparant advantages given to warrior taunt......untill you dig a little deeper. Are the LDON buyable hate procs the silver platter war's wanted? Negative. But I wouldn't kick it out of bed for eating crackers like you are so righteously doing.<br />
<br />
You'll see more and more warriors with proc augs as time goes on.  The reality is though that it doesn't address the aggro imbalance though, as shown above, where they are merely an increase in frequency of random events.   Perhaps randomizing spell refreshes would be the best analogy I could make... if this happenned, then there would be a lot closer to parity.... me hoping for a proc, you hoping the spells would become ungreyed.<br />
<br />
<br />
BigAL: I can see that! lmao Either that or they are so set in their conclusions about balancing that no other viable option seems reasonable...... but I digress<br />
<br />
Or, warriors simply don't feel that added random events are an acceptable solution.   I for one don't.<br />
<br />
cue: I've actually given that some thought believe it or not. But I chose not to bring it up because most warriors (yes I'm generalizing) have a decent selection of weapons to switch out for special circumstances. And yes itemization is not a &quot;fix&quot; persay towards universal balancing, I agree.<br />
<br />
So then, what precisely IS your point then?   I mean, suppose people were like myself and had an augmented blade of war and still were pissed off about the current situation because it allows one person to control their playstyle while preventing another from doing such without an offsetting advantage of similar value.   Then what would you say?</div></div><hr />

Now you are just embarassing yourself.  <br />
<br />
LDON has provided the means for wars to significantly increase their agro abilities to once again be competitive for exp group tanks. Is it free? no. Do you have to make some effort to obtain better agro? you bet. Should you already have this ability? thats argueable (per Absor).  <br />
<br />
A lucid point...but that takes the accumulation of weeks of points that doesn't help low-mid end warrs much (to aquire 2k+ pts is alot different for a 65 than a 50-55).  <br />
<br />
Also it ignores the &quot;malfunction&quot; of the taunt key....the crux of most warr imbalance auguments....pure equipment related fixes are the bane of most warrs and the norm for SoE.  What most warrs want: FIX THE INTRINSIC ABILITIES OF THE WARRIOR CLASS NOT REQUIRE MORE DEPENDENCIES ON EQUIPMENT/MODS etc. (you quoted is arguable...I'm arguing ;-)</div></div><hr />

People had it beat into their brains that knights were a waste of mana - and it was true. Over a course of several months, people slowly came to realize the value of a knight's agro. Eventually it became universally known that we are more efficient and safer to have as MT for exp groups, but by no means did this happen over night. <br />
<br />
This is wrong. People who weren't idiots knew that knights were terrific exp group tanks since late Velious, and were clearly preferable in Luclin.</div></div><hr />

removal of exp penalty<br />

Warriors should simply BE FIXED. Making us grind out a zillion adventures for a few extra crappy procs (which STILL don't bridge the aggro gap) is crap.

<br />
I don't play a warrior. My main is a wizard; my paladin is about my fourth alt. As a prime source of non-tanking aggro, I KNOW without a doubt who I want out in front of me; right now, it's a paladin. It SHOULD be any of the three tank classes. But if we go with Furor's solution and nerf two-thirds of the tanks down to warrior level, then *my* effectiveness goes in the bucket - I'll have to go easy on nukes every fight, not just fights when I have a warrior tanking for me. The same happens with clerics having to be careful on heal aggro, shamans having to wait until 80 pct to slow - *everyone* will have their efficiency reduced, not for lack of ability but for lack of survivability. <br />
<br />
I shouldn't have to babysit a tank's aggro. Right now, I don't have to, except for warriors. The answer isn't to reduce me to Kunark levels - it's to raise warriors above it. <br />
<br />
 This is the poster child of Paladin aggro lock. This is what it brings. Note it well, if you never did before.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This I have to plain disagree with.  I was still going LFG for hours during early Luclin on my 55 paladin.  Seems like it was 4-5 months into Luclin when I really noticied a shift in opinion, and even then I was having arguments with clerics who did not want a gimp tank. <br />
<br />
I don't recall paladins having an edge in Luclin - to me it seemed more balanced.  I do remember arguing with warriors who were pissed that they had to go LFG for 30 minutes since they should be the preferred tank for xp groups.<br />
<br />
I also realize that it is currently too far in favor of knights currently.  I just don't belive nerfing knights will do anything to help warriors.  Fix warrior's or fix all of the problems (Mana regeneration and Slow come to mind).</div></div><hr />

Randomly losing to monsters is not fun.  That is as challenging and as much fun as losing a flip on a coin.  Its bad when you lose but even worse when you win.  Are you going to take credit for your skill in being lucky?<br />
<br />
If you really want a fun environment, you don't randomly punish players.  Instead you create fun to fight monsters.  That water mephit you just killed going to behave the same way in 15 minutes when it respawns as it will tomorrow as it will next week as it will a year from now.<br />
<br />
I personally hate the drugery of kill that water mephit over and over and over again for its stupid drop.  Exp has been removed from the equation due to various changes.  The only thing left is what the monster gives me in terms of material.<br />
<br />
How is randomly mucking up the group going to make killing the water mephit more fun?  I just don't see it.  Randomly injecting failure into flat content like that is a sure fire way to make people avoid it.  For instance if you could just make the water mephit randomly proc something extra nasty.  That is a random so people will have fun right?  What EQ seems to indicate people would then just start avoiding water mephits all together.  So your path to fun seems to be just a fast track to killing content.  Warriors are suffering from this &quot;random fun&quot; ability right now.  Why spread it to other classes?  Why not suggest that Enchanters need to have a higher rate of failing to &quot;add fun&quot;?  It just doesn't seem to make sense at all.<br />
<br />
If you want a more exciting game, you need to have more exciting monsters.  Skills are made and given to players to excirse, not to be afraid to be used.  If you expect people to embrace the idea of failing at a noticable rate after levels of proper training you don't understand human nature.  People will fell cheated and just abandon it instead of having fun so many of you think will happen.</div></div><hr />

2 things - first off its about acceptable odds.  Sometimes the dice won't go your way, but is that 50% of the time like flipping a coin, or 5percent of the time? and secondly, can skill overcome those odds? <br />
<br />
Im assuming the Flip a Coin example you are using is to represent a warrior losing agro and having taunt fail the required number of times for the slower / nuker / healer to die.  If this happened 50% of the time and there was nothing you could do about it warriors would never get groups and PoP wouldn't be the fun expansion some of us are enjoying.<br />
<br />
Really the situation where some poor dress wearer bites it and there is nothing the warrior can do about it because of a bad roll of the dice only comes about for reasons that go deeper than a flip of the coin.<br />
<br />
Its more likely to be something like it was a level 55 enchanter trying to slow a level 63 mob in Plane of Valor.  With a Paladin tank maybe you could get away with something like that, but if the enchanter is going to draw agro they are going to die, and really an enchanter of that level shouldnt be there.  It isnt until level 61 that a chanter gets the tools needed to perform their role in PoV - inparticular Apathy, Arcane Rune and Boggle.<br />
<br />
Ofcourse that 55 chanter could be making good safe slightly slower XP with a warrior tank somewhere like plane of disease instead and then rather than having levelled to 65 on the back of Knight taunt in the space of a week, that chanter would actually have some skills by the time they hit 65.<br />
<br />
AGRO LOCK IS BREEDING RETARDS!<br />
<br />
lol, I think I've derailed my own post, but the essence of what I am trying to say is that while there is a chance that the coin toss wont go your way when relying on Warrior agro control, having skilled players of reasonable level and gear for the zones you are playing in you can over come those times that taunt failed repeatedly.  <br />
<br />
Nobody dies, and the game remains both a challenge and fun.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 Sure, I've seen Beastlords work. Nope, never seen a Ranger tank in BoT on named, never seen a Cleric tank stuff in Tactics.<br />
<br />
 Now tell the board how many Rangers on your server are geared enough to do it. Then tell us how many Rangers there are on your server period. Do the same with your tanking Clerics, and do some simple division. Bet the result comes to something less than 1%.<br />
<br />
 I'm not going to let your semantic &lt;1% blind folks to the fact that Paladins give up too little for aggro generation. That's because, you see, the number of Paladins who can tank for XP groups is a lot bigger than &lt;1%.<br />
<br />
Maybe masocist is a strong word. You just want a simple game where you flip a coin to see if you win or lose. You feel that is a major accomplishment that none of your group died?

<br />
 See, that's why you play a Paladin, because you don't want to accept risk as a part of the game. And, no, if people play intelligently, it's a hell of a lot better chance of survival than 50-50. Of course, I invite you to a game free of random rewards or punishments - Tic Tac Toe would suit you, I think.</div></div><hr />

Making paladins aggro as bad as a warrior does nothing. Also, changing the spell costs for paladins really doesn't do much either. So the group would have to either med or get a bard/beastlord/necro for mana regen. BFD. You know that constantly complaining about how much better some other class is than you only reinforces that idea with other people. <br />
<br />
I have seen warriors bring the attitudes from this board into the game and I have seen people stop asking warriors to tank because they believe the stories about how broken they are since it was a warrior telling it to them. As a person who started my EQ life out as a warrior I find that sad, but I can't blame people who don't play the class for trusting the words of someone who does. Conversly, I have seen warriors go into a group saying they will tank, tanking well, and everyone having a blast. Those people are the ones who, in my experience, do not LFG for long before getting picked up.<br />
<br />
I have seen how EQ representatives work with people that are decent to them, but I have only seen a handful of well thought out posts on this board about the issues facing warriors mixed into the multitude of posts that tell Sony to F-Off. Gee, I have no idea why their personel doesn't spend more time here rather than on the boards where they are treated with respect and worked with.<br />
<br />
In short, yes, there are issues with warriors that need to be addressed. Yes, it would be great if Sony came out with some sort of timetable about it. However, it would also be nice to have people play classes they enjoy (I can't see how anyone can enjoy playing a toon that is as worthless as many warriors make warriors out to be) and have people be constructive in their conversations about changes that need to be made.</div></div><hr />

I assume you were pointing that at me. I did that for the 8 months I played my warrior. I started playing EQ after warriors were supposedly &quot;broken&quot; since I started about a month before PoP came out. So, I spent all 58 levels that I played that toon with this &quot;handicap&quot;. Guess what, it wasn't that freakin hard.

How many Rangers and Beasts on your server have similar AA's and equipment? 20 - 30 is probably overoptimistic. I have no experience of elementals  - are Rangers and Beasts commonly tanking there instead of warriors (the place where their level of equippage tops out)?

you realize what unmitigated bullshit this is, right?<br />

If knight agro gets nerfed, you know what happens?  warriors become able to compete for tank slots again.<br />
<br />
Knight agro has made people stupid.  I played with some gimp enchanter yesterday who, on *every single goddam pull*, tashed before I got the mob to camp.  Now I managed to keep him alive, but he didnt deserve to live, he dserved to die the first friggin time he tried that stunt.<br />

Knight agro is the reason people like him exist.<br />
<br />
Removing knight agro would do so many wonderful things for the game, I get happy little goosebumps just thinking about it.  SO please dont be ridiculous.  Warriors *know* how to deal with our agro, and if knights suddenly had warrior-level agro it would be nothing but good for the game.  Warriors certainly wouldnt be compaining anymore.</div></div><hr />

Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope....  obviously nerfing would correct warriors current problems and it is the only thing that will bring them on par with the content we are currently finding ourselves fighting against.<br />

 Warriors are the BASELINE. Content is balanced melee-wise by SoE around US, not you. You have too much aggro control for your survivability.</div></div><hr />

Attititudes like this are why people think warriors suck!<br />
<br />
I play paladin and enchanter mains, and when on my enchanter it is usually grouped with a warrior, and you bet I tash and have the mob slowed before it even gets close to the warrior, otherwise you lose the warriors advantage of better damage mitigation.<br />
<br />
Wait for the warrior to build some aggro before debuffing and of course warriors are inferior to knights but give them some decent aggro to taunt at from the outset and they ain't as broke as a lot of people here suggest.<br />
<br />
It's rare, in exp groups, that the warrior should even be pulling, just about every other class in the game are better at it. Play to a warriors strengths and a half clued up group will have few problems but play mindlessly and the above happens!<br />
<br />
The problem is of course that most exp groups would rather play mindlessly, so knights have the advantage, but how do you fix warriors without breaking/trivialising the game for those that are prepared to think?</div></div><hr />

hehehe, can't wait for the responses to this one, i agree .. mostly :) because in the majority of cases these people still don't die if the group is up to scratch, but they have to 'work' at it - God forfend the game requires 'effort' to win :p</div></div><hr />

 Quit throwing bullshit and pretending it smells like rose petals. I gave 4 very simple ideas which I contended would eliminate most of the imbalance.<br />
<br />
 1. Hardcap on Cease to level 35, Desist to level 41.<br />
<br />
 2. Eliminate aggro generation on resisted stuns and reduce aggro generated by partial resists.<br />
<br />
 3. Improve taunt.<br />
<br />
 4. Give Paladins the /shield ability.<br />
<br />
 Now, explain to me WHY they're so bad, or so much of a 'nerf'. This will be especially funny coming from you, a Paladin who claims never to use either Cease OR Desist.<br />
<br />
Do you ever wonder why paladins and some warriors don't bother coming to this board anymore, with attitudes like yours? <br />
<br />
 As I pointed out to ANOTHER Paladin as equipped in debate as yourself, I don't deal attitude to folks like Romidar. But then again, Romidar's not on a disinformation campaign like so many Paladins, yourself included.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. They think everything is fine.<br />
2. They are working on it but aren't going to discuss it.<br />
3. They have already done all they are going to to about it.<br />
<br />
#3 is pretty intriguing IMO.<br />
<br />
We have CHoS and SotB to &quot;give&quot; the caual, mid-level, and not optimally equipped higher level player's aggro weapons. Add in LDoN augments and they could claim itemization of aggro weapons is perfect.<br />
<br />
If they do not believe there is any problem with Warrior Taunt, then what does that mean? They believe warriors should be only desired in groups whre their beef is needed - dumb/beefy/soldiers.<br />
<br />
It is entirely possible that they believe Knights should be well rounded classes and Warriors should buy buffs in PoK or have inferior survivability, inferior aggro capabilites, and no spells in experiance groups. (I've yet to find a Paladin casting Brells SS in PoK when I /ooc Looking for Brells SS - will donate 100pp. Perhaps they are all busy grouping.)<br />
<br />
Thanks to the vendor recharge nerf I have something at least to occupy my time when LFG. Hunting Lava potions and Crystalline Silk Nets. I suspect this is a good indication that SoE wants Warriors to have to spend a lot of time camping items just to be able to tank like the real tank.<br />

Your conlusion: Yay!  Warriors get groups Knights used to get!<br />

Um...there is a little problem with your reasoning.  Warriors didn't change.  They still have the same crappy control they had.<br />

In the past, Warriors have asked for better aggro control and were rebuffed. The impression I got is that SoE or Verant reasoned that classes should have an important limitation that they become better at dealing with as they level and get equipment. If Warrior aggro was intended to be in this catagory, then some mistakes have been made.<br />
<br />
1. Dropable aggro weapons should not exist. Aggro weapons should be one of the two Warrior equipment &quot;Holy Grails&quot; (the other is 10K HP's). It should take a guild raid or at least a group to acquire one. In many ways getting a good aggro weapon is a replacement for the Warrior Epic quest. Buying one at the bazaar cheapens it.<br />
<br />
2. Aggro augmentations are also a litle iffy. I suppose camping something for a horrendous amount of time is considered equivalent to killing RZ.<br />
<br />
3. The Taunt button does not scale properly. After &quot;earning&quot; it's maximum effect a Warrior's aggro capabilities should be equivilent to those tanks not sharing his limitation. I believe the value for Taunt skill should be used to determine the success rate for gaining the top of the hate list if you aren't already there (as it does now), but with the maximum value having a failure rate essentially the same as stun fizzle rate. I also believe it should be used to calculate an amount of Hate added to your total. With reasonable behavior, it's refresh could be longer.<br />
<br />
The problem Warriors face is most Classes believe we need an improvement, we know we need an improvement, and SoE is saying nothing. I fear it's because they have nothing to say.<br />

<br />
Remove the Taunt  key from every class EXCEPT warriors...<br />
<br />
Give Taunt the same fail rate as the level appropriate Paladin Stun spell fizle rate.<br />
<br />
Make Taunt have a message... ie. Mob_01 Roars its head in anger at Taunter_01. --or -- Mob_01 ignores the efforts of Taunter_01.<br />
<br />
If Taunt is OOR, give a message and allow the instant refresh of taunt.<br />
<br />
Give taunt a range of 200<br />
<br />
Give Taunt a quick refresh when it fizzles... say 2.5 sec, and then have a normal refresh of 9 sec.<br />
<br />
All problems solved with taunt. It is now perfectly Balanced and fixxed...<br />

<br />
200 is HUGE range, CH doesn't even cast that far.  50 is a much more reasonable range for taunt.<br />
<br />
Taunt should remain for the knight classes.  There are three tank classes, not one.  It should merely have an increased failure rate when compared to warriors.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not even sure where to begin...<br />
<br />
1. Any Paladin / Shadowknight that relies on /taunt past level 9, let alone at the high end of the game, should have their head examined - there are much better ways of securring agro and keeping yourself miles ahead of eveyone else on the mobs hate list.<br />
<br />
2. The real issue is itemization - when will SOE realize that when you make an item XAC 100+HP/100+MANA that is usable by multiple classes you give a disproportionate benefit to hybrids?<br />
<br />
(IMO hybrids should be forced to chose - do I want to be the warrior paladin and take the 20ac 100hp/50mana item or do I want to be the healer paladin and take the 10ac 50hp/100mana item?)<br />
<br />
The sad problem is that when they try and fix this by giving War/Rog/Mnk items that are Xac Xhp you end up with rogues and warriors who can tank...<br />
<br />
Unfortunately I think it is way too late in the game to fix itemization so that Warriors get their own loot tables, Bard/Rng/Pal/Sk on one, Monk/Rogue on one, Priests on one, Int casters on another.<br />
<br />
They could make an effort to tune upper ele loot / time loot / LDoN loot / next expansion loot to address this but I don't know if that will solve the issue.<br />
<br />
3. Nerf stun agro all you want, thanks for the help!  I would then macro a taunt key back to my main set of keys (which I haven't done in 3years) and relly on /taunt, weapon procs and heals to generate and hold argo - should be more than enough in exp groups that know what they are doing and would allow me free use of stuns to lock down and interupt casters as well as position mobs (all of which would be wonderful on raids knowing I won't steal agro from the MT...).<br />
<br />
But then again, nerf my stuns and the warriors don't have a nice chunk of agro to clone off of the mob while inc from the 3stuns I laid on it....<br />
<br />
4. Warrior agro is not the problem imo - too much warrior argo trivializes raid content.<br />
<br />
I actually like it when our members have to use their heads and be cognisant of what they are doing as opposed to chain nuking / doting / debuffing because they think MA agro is endless.<br />
<br />
Force your Enc to use boggle / wizards concussion / rangers jolt / monks, SKs &amp; Necros FD, Rogues evade, etc etc etc.<br />
<br />
Force your buff classes to use agro generation on the MT as opposed to relying on procs and taunt - there are enough tools available to make current warrior agro sufficient for every encounter out there and those to be thought up.<br />
<br />
Great, lets do what Furor has argued in some thread I read somewhere and give warriors so much agro that the mob doesn't even think about anyone else in their universe - woot that will make encounters fun so all the mellee can auto attack /afk and the nukers can burn through their mana, please.<br />
<br />
5. I will conceed that warriors do far to little dmg (especially when tanking) but then again all melee do so little compared to casters that it is pitiful.<br />
<br />
Couple thoughts: <br />
a) changed the way ripostes are calculated while DW;<br />
b) make shields worth using (via block or whatever);<br />
c) up warrior / monk / rogue skill caps significantly, up the attack modifier for each of these three classes as well;<br />
d) allow warriors an AAXP or innate skill to tradeskill / craft some type of 'coating' for their weapon to add short term procs (akin to rogues but make them DD / Agro specific if we are forced to address bad itemization with worse itemization); <br />
<br />
Nerfing Knights doesn't help warriors and it hurts your guild, focusing on the shortcomings of your class and advocating that they be addressed seems smarter to me...<br />
<br />
Seems the Rogues and Monks got it right in making each others case to ensure they were looked after, I wonder when the 3 tanking plate classes will figure that out?</div></div><hr />

Try to wrap your brain around these concepts:<br />
<br />
1.  warriors are supposed to be the best tanks, per SOE's class descriptions.<br />
<br />
2.  Knights are supposed to be inferior but still servicable tanks, again per SOEs class descriptions.<br />
<br />
3.  Currently, Knights outcompete warriors for tank spots.  Ergo, knights are unabalanced relative to warriors, who are supposed to outcompete knights for these spots.<br />
<br />
You honestly dont see how nerfing knights would rectify the situation?  How much more obvious could it be?<br />
<br />
You truly believe people would begin using beastlords to tank?  Rangers?  If that day comes, nerf them too.  But it wont come - people would, instead, begin to re-learn how to actually play the fuckin game <br />
<br />
(i.e. theyd learn that youre an idiot if you slow and tash on inc without waiting for agro, etc).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chavr</div><div class="date">10-27-2003, 01:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ergo, knights are unabalanced relative to warriors, who are supposed to outcompete knights for these spots.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blatantly false.  Knigths and warriors should be equaled desired as tank.  Neither of the three classes should be more prefered as there is only one tank spot and three classes to fill that spot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">landrain</div><div class="date">10-27-2003, 02:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">And another paladin rides in and misses the boat...<br />

So then why is it then the ONLY way warriors have to deal with aggro? If you yourself say it is a TOTAL waste of time, then why should warriors be reduced to the mash and pray method of aggro control... which is about as controlled as betting the Pension plan on the fat horse who took a dump just before the Kentucky Derby...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Not at all, they can easilly correct the modifiers for different stats on items by classes. Also, Removing all the HP AA's from non-warriors would make a good start. <br />
<br />
Itemization is totally messed up. We know this, we also DO NOT BELIEVE it is the correct way to fix a CLASS imbalance by using Itemization. A class should not be totally dependant upon equipment to perform its basic class function, UNLESS there are EXTREME benefits to that class... No One is as dependant upon Equipment as warrior.. NO ONE.. name a class and I will give the proof.<br />
<br />
<br />
3. Nerf stun agro all you want, thanks for the help!

<br />
<br />
Did you even read the opening Post in this thread? [url=http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=3850] I am gathering you didnt because NO WHERE in it did I say to change the aggro on stuns, ESPECIALLY STUNS that affect mobs with say a KB effect.. Read post 1.. maybe you will get an understanding of the idea here..(bah, stupid me, so many threads with paladins defending the indefensible i get confused at times..but the point is still valid)... Only warriors that have waited and waited and believed SoE would fix the problem, and finally are at the end of their rope with the 'promises' to fix class balance are calling for all out Nerfs... And honestly should we blame them? <br />
<br />
<br />
But then again, nerf my stuns and the warriors don't have a nice chunk of agro to clone off of the mob while inc from the 3stuns I laid on it....<br />
<br />
<br />
I love these statements.. so its in the 'BEST' interest of warriors that paladins have this incrediblely overpowered aggro generation capacity... umm, yeah, we can do without your help here. If it was that easy, we would piggyback off the enchater tash/slow, shaman malo/slow, cleric stun... etc etc etc.. This is one of the biggest fallacies of the paladin argument.<br />
<br />
<br />
4. Warrior agro is not the problem imo - too much warrior argo trivializes raid content.<br />

<br />
Force your buff classes to use agro generation on the MT as opposed to relying on procs and taunt - there are enough tools available to make current warrior agro sufficient for every encounter out there and those to be thought up.<br />
<br />
<br />
Finally an intelligent statement.. except all this is DONE, Every day its done hundreds of times, on me and my fellow MT's.. ON RAIDS! the problems lie not on raids, but on the fact that warriors cant get groups because they cant compete in group aggro with knights(paladins specifically here)<br />
<br />
<br />
5. I will conceed that warriors do far to little dmg (especially when tanking) but then again all melee do so little compared to casters that it is pitiful.<br />
<br />
<br />
Most warriors couldnt aggree more, except we never have been and should never be a 'dps' class. In fact our pitiful dps advantage over paladins is one the great rallying cries of paladins who are protecting their turf...<br />
<br />
Bringing Knight aggro back in line with warriors would allow all three to be 'VALID' tanks in PoP zones, currently the Knight by far exceed any warrior capabilities until you get to the very top end of warriors in EQ. The average joe warrior is left far behind a similarly equipped knight.<br />
<br />
There are many ideas to upgrade warriors. However right now upgradeing a warrior in anything BUT Aggro control will NOT solve the exp group problem, Unless aggro is raised to Knight Equivalent levels the problem will continue. And No one I know really wants warriors to have that level of aggro. It will make raiding as trivial as Exp groups...(well at least thats the popular paladin spin on things)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeka</div><div class="date">10-27-2003, 03:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay please follow along Aldarion_Shard.  Here are your points:<br />
<br />
-----<br />
A. &quot;warriors are supposed to be the best tanks, per SOE's class descriptions.&quot;<br />
<br />
B. &quot;Knights are supposed to be inferior but still servicable tanks, again per SOEs class descriptions.&quot;<br />
<br />
C. &quot;Knights outcompete warriors for tank spots.&quot;<br />
<br />
Conclusion A: &quot;Ergo, knights are unabalanced relative to warriors&quot; (plus you tack on a superfilous qualifier).<br />
<br />
Conclusion B: &quot;Nerf Knights!&quot;<br />
-----<br />
<br />
Conlusion A although true isn't supported by your arguments.  The key is C: Warriors already out tank Knights but fail to get groups.  Either tanking is no longer as valuable as it used to be for a group skill or something else is going on.  (hint: I mention what it is later)<br />
<br />
Conclusion B is a false delima.  You make it sound like the only way to achieve balance is to nerf Knights.  You can achieve your idea of balance by nerfing all Casters.  You can also achieve your idea of balance by nerfing the monsters.  Why nerf Knights when you will get a much better result nerfing every POP monster out there?<br />
<br />
Everyone acknowledges that Knights are stronger than Warriors for exp group tanking.  However this does not mean you can tack on any assertions that happen to correlate without support.<br />
<br />
Could Aldarion_Shard be a hold out of the old Warrior mentality?  Basic melee is in sad shape.  It has been stretched too far while spell casting has grown exceptionally well.  All Hybrids see this as plain as day.  No Hybrid relies on just melee any more because its too limiting.  Hybrids have advanced to tactics beyond staring at the monster with auto attack on.<br />
<br />
The question becomes why do Warriors want to avoid getting advance melee tactics just like the Knights have?<br />
<br />
As a final word, I do like some of the ideas put forth.  I just hate the suggestion that somehow nerfing Knights will magically fix Warrior woes and make groups run back to embrace Warriors.  The only thing that will accomplish is make Knights work harder and Warriors still LFG where it counts.  <br />
<br />
Warrior problems are simply because they lack any skills over the monster.   Every Hybrid and Caster class has multiple things they can do to a monster.  Why do so many Warriors out there believe that the game is better served by turning on auto-attack and keeping the monster in frame?  Or that somehow any class that can is wrong and broken?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I quite agree that warriors could use more than just hitting autoattack, but that does not by any stretch mean that a tank class should be able to circumvent game balancing design limitations (aggro control) from other party members (as gone over in depth in the latest of many aggro lock debates below and elsewhere). <br />
<br />
It's particularly ironic that that limitation which you say should be removed is one of the few remaining that would restrain the already extremely powerful casters who apparently put melee into the shade at this time....</div></div><hr />

<br />
look, first of all dont be so absurdly insulting as to say that warriors want to just &quot;turn on auto attack and then keep the mob in frame&quot;.  Fcuk that hybrid &quot;we are so much more complex!!1!&quot; bullshit.  Have you ever played a tank AT ALL? OF ANY KIND?<br />
<br />
positioning.<br />
weapon choice.<br />
Taunt.<br />
groupmates who actually MANAGE THEIR OWN FUCKING AGRO. (yes, this means turning off attack from time to time, and it means never tashing on incoming, etc.)<br />
<br />
There is a HELL of a lot more to holding agro than &quot;turn on auto attack and then sit back and watch&quot;.  ANd I hereby extend a hearty &quot;Fuck You&quot; to any hybrid candyass who wants to come in here and act like warriors have such a simple job.<br />
<br />
Just because Knight agro has dumbed down the game to &quot;cast stun, hit mob, repeat til dead&quot; does NOT mean we should allow the entire game to become so dumbed down.  Agro is complex and mysterious.. for us.  For you, its so simple a chipmanzee really could do it... its 1-2 buttons you press whenever they ungrey and you are GUARANTEED agro.<br />
<br />
Now as far as the rest of your tripe... look.  We are competing for a spot.  Of course there are several options available for how to make this competition more appropriately balanced (and notice I did not say &quot;equal&quot;.  knights were never intended to be equal tanks to warriors.. just servicable replacements in a pinch.).... but I choose to remain somewhat realistic.<br />
<br />
Warriors are *not* going to get a massive taunt upgrade, because it makes the developers scared to think of it.  Warriors are also not going to get the 10k hp/1k AC upgrade they would need to make the current taunt disparity balanced.  Thus, the only remaining solution is to nerf knights.<br />
<br />
And finally, one last point.  stop with the played out bullshit excuse that warriors tank better than knights.  This was true in kunark.  It *should* be true today.  But its not true, and probably never will be again.<br />
<br />
Value as a tank is determined by the product of agro generation and damage mitigation.  Claiming that warriors out tank knights is as absurd as claiming that enchanters out tank knights, or that charmed pets out tank knights.  Sure enchanters make more agro, but they mitigate like a wet tissue.  Sure charmed pets have a ton of hp, but they cant get agro if anotehr melee is in range.  <br />
<br />
And the same is true of warriors.  No, we dont out tank knights.  Accept reality already.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can't claim that enchanters can out tank knights, but in EXP groups with half decent gear and aa they can out tank warriors. I do this all the time in all caster multi-charm groups in anything up to and including tier 3 zones. The thing is enchanters (like knights) have the tools to keep aggro ie. stuns (that dont actually effect the mob ...shock/horror!) /tash/slow/low level dd+stun (again the stun doesn't land but does aggro very nicely) and I also mitigate incoming damage pretty well chaincasting a 1500 damage absorbing rune every 5 seconds. Plus i can do what knights can do and warriors can't ......I can guarantee that the only one needing a heal will be me!<br />
<br />
My point is that leave warriors as you are now and I will leave you sitting LFG because in most situations warriors offer bugger all! Nerf Knights and I will do the same with them! Now I am not claiming that this is how the game should be, but it is where we are at at the moment. Warriors need improving but reduce knights to your level and no plate class will have a slot in caster groups!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Give Taunt the same fail rate as the level appropriate Paladin Stun spell fizle rate.<br />

Make Taunt have a message... ie. Mob_01 Roars its head in anger at Taunter_01. --or -- Mob_01 ignores the efforts of Taunter_01.<br />

If Taunt is OOR, give a message and allow the instant refresh of taunt.<br />
<br />
Give taunt a range of 200<br />

Give Taunt a quick refresh when it fizzles... say 2.5 sec, and then have a normal refresh of 9 sec.<br />
<br />
All problems solved with taunt. It is now perfectly Balanced and fixxed...<br />
<br />
This is the kind of suggestion that leads to the famous quote... and the game is now broken because of warrior aggro.  If you want to fix Taunt then have it add set aggro even on a failure.  Its already the most powerful aggro tool in the game in many situations, its just not useful as the only real aggro tool for warriors.  I think a much better solution is to make taunt put you at top of aggro list + X on a success or give you X aggro on a failure.  Not sure what the value of X would be.  Then make the X aggro part work at range but not the top of aggro list part.  To me that would make taunt completely balanced.  If they wanted to include a negative to the positive gained by this new taunt they could bind it to the kick/bash key so warriors lose a tiny bit of DPS still while maintaining aggro just like they do today with aggro weapons, though I don't see that its really necessary.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mana is rarely, if ever a problem and I actually feel safer if I know I am going to be tanking than if we have our warrior tanking simply because I am expecting to tank whereas with the warrior I sometimes end up tanking when i am not expecting to be, and more importantly (for my survival) when the healer isn't expecting me to be tanking.<br />
<br />
As to the &quot;safe on adds&quot; bit, it depends on what we are doing but adds are an enchanters meat and drink so generally are not a problem, if I see a potential add I pacify so that it doesn't, if it's already added I mez or root depending on circumstances, tank or no tank it really doesn't make a difference.</div></div><hr />

is this actually an attempt at getting casters (specifically enchanters) nerfed?<br />

because it wouldnt be a bad thing.  Warriors originally had a 15%ish HP advantage vs paladins, which is now down to under 5%.<br />

My cleric heals probably 200% better than he did at 60, my necro kicks out a in excess of 200% more dps than she did at 60 as does my enchanter, and they can do it without having to take med breaks! Now my paladin can keep up and work with these increases where a warrior tends to struggle, so unless you are suggesting nerfing all caster classes, which isn't going to happen, then the only solution is some kind warrior improvement.<br />
<br />
Nerf knights aggro or make it so they need to med every other fight then caster will simply sideline those too and as more casters realise that a tank is not essential for a regular exp group, and that in fact plate classes often slow the exp down, warriors will be in a worse state LFG wise than they are now.</div></div><hr />

I go into BoT.  I /ooc 65 war lfg and get a response from one of my guild paladins to rep him.  Ok I join the group but the group falls apart when I join, ok, fine i'm all right with that and go lfg again.  Next thing I see is that most of the people that were in my previous group are forming again at the same place but this time there is a 65 paladin tanking.  This is not five minutes after the group disbanded.<br />

I think i have a decent rep as a warrior on my server but groups just prefer knights, I would too if I was not playing a War. <br />

That has to be the singularly most idiotic statement I've ever read.  Summarized, it's saying that warriors benefit from the current overease of knight aggro because casters still want &quot;a tank&quot;, whereas if knights have difficulty, tanking would be a bygone thing.<br />

NO FUCKING SHIT, BUT ACCORDING TO YOUR GOD DAMNED ARGUMENT, SINCE YOU ARE BETTER TANKS THAN THEM, THEY SHOULD HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER AGGRO THAN YOU YOU FUCKING RETARDS.<br />
<br />
Rangers tank WAY worse in ratio to knights than knights do to warriors, WHY THE FUCK dont' knights suffer aggro in relation to Rangers?   <br />
<br />
I mean rangers are SUPPOSED to tank, they have a taunt button after all, how come you god damned selfish bastard paladins want tanking superiority over them?   BY YOUR OWN ARGUMENTS Rangers should be WAY the fuck ahead of you in the aggro department.    You fucking hypocritical assholes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That doesn't change the fact that it's true Frodlin.  The groups that currently are willing to accept a warrior as tank are the ones who are willing to endure crappy aggro control.  All other groups require aggro lock or are set up not to requir a tank at all.  <br />
<br />
If warriors are currently getting 5% of the total group slots and the aggro control of knights is nerfed to warrior levels then that 5% of group slots will be occupied by warriors, paladins, and SKs instead of just warriors.  So yes that will in fact reduce the number of groups warriors get.  Any group that was not willing to take a warrior for a tank will STILL not take a warrior for a tank.  They'll either use a non plate tank or they'll just kite it.<br />
<br />
I'm not happy with the fact that knights get the best of both worlds (aggro lock + warrior like tankability) but nerfing knight aggro won't help us at all.  They need to either boost warrior aggro control to knight levels or eliminate the ability of any class to inflict damage on a mob without SOMEONE tanking as well as removing the ability of any class except warrior, paladin, and SK to tank.  By this I mean nerfing the shit out of sow, snare, root, slow, charm, fear, etc.<br />
<br />
So which is the most likely scenario?<br />
<br />
1.  Nerf knight aggro so all plate tanks including warriors can't get a group<br />
<br />
2.  Give warriors knightlike aggro control giving us all a viable slot as xp group tank<br />
<br />
3.  Introduce a massive nerf of the ability for any class to solo as well as removing many of the crowd control and primary damage dealing functions of some classes.  Also reducing the ability of ALL classes except plate classes to tank.<br />
<br />
4.  Screw warriors and just do nothing.<br />
<br />
Personally the only option I could ever see SoE taking that would actually help us would be option 2.  Option 3 would be ideal but there's no way in hell they'll ever do it.  Option 4 is the option they have taken until now and probably the one they will continue to take.</div></div><hr />

<br />
if you want aggro of a knight, go play a knight.<br />
<br />
if you want to tank .05% of the content with defensive, play a warrior.<br />
<br />
you can either cry that you are disadvantaged or you can do something about it. accept it, make the change if needed, and drive on. when verant notices that the number of warriors decreases dramatically, then they will do something not untill then. they nerfed monks when the monk population was exploding. they improved knights when there were none. now there are less active monks, and more active knights.<br />
<br />
they cannot increase warrior aggro using existing means, it would increase all aggro, it would trivialize content.<br />
<br />
they cannot increase warrior DPS using existing means, it would push the rest of the melee too. and this would fix nothing and only trivialize more content.<br />
<br />
they cannot change how AC affects how much damage you take, it would be passed onto the rest of the classes and have the same effect on them. again, all this would do is trivialize encounters.<br />
<br />
with CH being capped at 7500 HP, anything beyond this is pointless, it just gives you an error factor in a CH chain. giving more HP to a warrior at 7500 hp does nothing effective, your CH rotation just has to match the DPS of the mob after the tank has reached 7500 HP.<br />
<br />
breaking apart the DISC timers to individual timers would also be passed onto the rest of the classes. knights get a few, warriors get more....but the coding for it so far has not been justifiable to have someone go back and search that arcane ass code they have for it now. it would probably break all disc's for a week or two atleast.<br />
<br />
SoE cannot modify the combat tables, because it would be passed onto the other classes as well, and be magnified in them. again trivialize encounters.  knights are behind warriors by one table if i remember the post 2-3 years ago.  increasing a warrior's table for level 50's is passed to the knights at 55. this is where giving warriors greater mitigation comes into play. SOE is not willing to make warriors on a completly different table, the possiblilities of it breaking innumberable things outweighs the reward. <br />
<br />
/shield was a knee jerk reaction by SOE when they saw DAoC. if they made the radius bigger, or set it to be an &quot;always on&quot; type thing, it would increase thier utility, but again, it is not thier primary role, but it would allow for 4th string warriors to have something more to do during a fight then hit auto attack and then play their Xbox. (i say 4th string, because i figure the first 3 warriors of a guild are in a rotation for thier Defensive skill)<br />
<br />
all that can be done is to give warriors an altogether ability that is new to the game, but unless the new ability is very throughly examined, thought about, tested and it's effects determined (ie, not using the populace as a sociology experiment) it could trivialize many existing encounters. SOE is scared of the creative player base, finding unexpected ways of using abilities designed for something else. for example &quot;FD was never inteded for pulling&quot;...<br />
<br />
again, Shit or get off the pot. either play the class as it is now, or retire and make the class you want. SOE responds only to player numbers and composition.<br />
<br />
if you want aggro, make a knight, it's what they do. if you want to tank the big ass boss mob, make a warrior, this is what they do. in other siutuations live with the consequences of your choice.<br />
<br />
yes, i know i'm about to get squished, but hell, i'm a tank, i can take it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They could do it easily.  All it takes is a type 7, type 3, and type 8 warrior only aug similiar to the effect found on the Time BP.  It wouldn't trivialize much content.  Guilds already know how to work with warriors for the few they are needed on.  Everywhere else, you can use a knight.  Keep that in mind...in any place you can use a knight, content is already trivial due to the amount of mana regen in the game.  <br />
<br />
Personally, I'd like to see them free up the sense heading skill since they are planning on making it start at 200 for newcomers anyway.  It's pointless, get rid of it entirely.  And then use that slot to give warriors Intimidation instead.<br />
<br />
breaking apart the DISC timers to individual timers would also be passed onto the rest of the classes. knights get a few, warriors get more....but the coding for it so far has not been justifiable to have someone go back and search that arcane ass code they have for it now. it would probably break all disc's for a week or two atleast. <br />
<br />
More importantly, it wouldn't really change much.  Gives melee a bit more versatility, but no real power increase.  For warriors, it would also mean a longer re-use time on defensive and evasive.  No way they'd let us have both with the current reuse time at 60.  So longer re-use time but access to both to counteract that.  Anyway, it'd be a good change and one they should make.  It gives pure melee a few options that they can use more freely.  It'd be fun.<br />
<br />
SOE is going to have to do something about warriors sooner or later.  More likely sooner.  Two reasons for this:<br />
1. Knights must be able to tank in most situations (non-boss mob, basically).<br />
2.  HP has reached a point such that Complete Heal isn't.  <br />
<br />
Add another expansion's worth of gear inflation to the mix, and what's left?  Once your typical CH hits for full amount, a higher hp total doesn't matter most of the time.  When that happens, what differentiates a warrior from knights?  Disciplines that don't matter except on raids?  Higher DPS than paladins when not fighting undead?  Warriors will basically be back to where they were at the launch of EQ.  <br />
<br />
I don't believe classes are that out of balance right now.  I believe monks could use a little love, pacify, FM, and stuns could use a little nerf, and most everything else is okay, though I'd love to see a few minor tweaks.<br />
<br />
But the next expansion that increases levels or inflates gear more, or maybe even LDoN as augs get spread around and Time gets farmed more, are going to necessitate that something be added to the warrior class.  Otherwise, we serve no point.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. Knight aggro gets nerfed into the toilet so that casters have to have skill to play Everquest.<br />
<br />
2. Warrior mitigation is increased so that they are *in melee defense* better than anyone else.<br />
<br />
3. ANY non-knight, non-warrior class should go splat like rangers did in Kunark if they catch aggro.<br />
<br />
There we have it, real balance and EQ the way it's supposed to be played<br />
<br />
That is all nice and dandy and I even agree with it, EQ would be much better if they did this... however you know it will never ever happen so its not really worth worrying about.  What you need to do is decide what they will be willing to change and push for that.  Nerfing every non warrior class in the game is probably not the proper way to fix the warrior problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frodlin7th</div><div class="date">11-01-2003, 07:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i think it's simple.<br />
<br />
if you want aggro of a knight, go play a knight.<br />
<br />
I wish I had a time machine sometimes, I really do, because when Knights were asking to be better tanks than they were, some warriors told them &quot;If you want to tank like a warrior, roll a warrior&quot;.    Guess who ended up getting what they wanted?<br />
<br />
<br />
you can either cry that you are disadvantaged or you can do something about it. accept it, make the change if needed, and drive on. when verant notices that the number of warriors decreases dramatically, then they will do something not untill then. they nerfed monks when the monk population was exploding. they improved knights when there were none. now there are less active monks, and more active knights.<br />
<br />
Population control of classes is a nice, unproven and I'd venture to say, a little ridiculous theory about why monks were nerfed, when Moorgard gave the whole reason....<br />
<br />
They ran some tests, and it showed what warriors had been saying.   <br />
<br />
they cannot increase warrior aggro using existing means, it would increase all aggro, it would trivialize content.<br />
<br />
Only in the mind of a sick sick person is aggro the only 'challenge' in EQ, only in the mind of a sick sick developer is aggro the only way to make an encounter hard.   Raparm is not trivial, and it has nothing to do with aggro.   There's other non-trivial mobs who are easy to control aggro (Rathe Council comes to mind).<br />
<br />
they cannot increase warrior DPS using existing means, it would push the rest of the melee too. and this would fix nothing and only trivialize more content.<br />
<br />
Sure they can, read the &quot;future plans&quot; section on the EQ Live site, the part where &quot;Melee have fallen behind their caster counterparts in melee damage&quot;.  It's in the works, whether you like it or not.<br />
<br />
they cannot change how AC affects how much damage you take, it would be passed onto the rest of the classes and have the same effect on them. again, all this would do is trivialize encounters.<br />
<br />
Wow, are your straw men all this easy to annihilate?   Just because something can be done outside of your ability to conceptualize doesn't mean it can't be done.    it's easy to put modifiers by class, easier than putting them by &quot;recommended level&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
with CH being capped at 7500 HP, anything beyond this is pointless, it just gives you an error factor in a CH chain. giving more HP to a warrior at 7500 hp does nothing effective, your CH rotation just has to match the DPS of the mob after the tank has reached 7500 HP.<br />
<br />
One of the easiest fixes would be to repeal the gay CH nerf or introduce a real CH spell which would give a benefit to more HP, then prevent others from reaching that point.<br />
<br />
breaking apart the DISC timers to individual timers would also be passed onto the rest of the classes. knights get a few, warriors get more....but the coding for it so far has not been justifiable to have someone go back and search that arcane ass code they have for it now. it would probably break all disc's for a week or two atleast.<br />
<br />
I'm willing to live 2 weeks with broken discs... I mean I've lived 2 and a half years with a broken class.<br />
<br />
SoE cannot modify the combat tables, because it would be passed onto the other classes as well, and be magnified in them. again trivialize encounters. knights are behind warriors by one table if i remember the post 2-3 years ago. increasing a warrior's table for level 50's is passed to the knights at 55. this is where giving warriors greater mitigation comes into play. SOE is not willing to make warriors on a completly different table, the possiblilities of it breaking innumberable things outweighs the reward.<br />
<br />
You're funny, really, funny, explain to me how exactly putting warriors on a completely different table would &quot;break innumerable things&quot;.   I eagerly await your response. <br />
<br />
<br />
again, Shit or get off the pot. either play the class as it is now, or retire and make the class you want. SOE responds only to player numbers and composition.<br />
<br />
Actually, they respond to far different things than you assume.    They respond on THEIR timetable, and respond when THEY choose to.  They didn't nerf monks because of numbers, they nerfed them because they saw what was happenning in-game.<br />
<br />
if you want aggro, make a knight, it's what they do. if you want to tank the big ass boss mob, make a warrior, this is what they do. in other siutuations live with the consequences of your choice.<br />
<br />
Funny, I gotta keep going back to the class descriptions, where the warrior is the one described as being the premier tank, and the one who is able to focus the mobs' attention onto himself.   It's not in yours....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">11-02-2003, 05:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Changing warrior ultimately is the same thing as nerfing everyone else so you might as well just nerf what's overpowered rather than nerfing everyone.  Being the baseline class all encounters are balanced against, if we get say tank 50% better then the encounter has to be more difficult by 50% to compensate, which means everyone else is now worse except warriors.<br />
<br />
Aggro control has always been part of this game.  It's more like a mechanism to ensure you can't kill boss X too fast.  Of course the game can still be challenging if hitting Taunt makes the mob never leave the warrior.  But then mobs would simply end up with HPs roughly equal to current HP + (all the damage a caster can do if he can instantly unload their mana bar).  Therefore I do not see improving taunt helps warriors at all because the end result is either mobs just deaggro that much better, or mobs have more HPs so that it wouldn't matter if all your wizards can nuke themselves OOM in the first 3 minutes.  An encounter's difficulty is directly related to how long the fight is (longer fights are inherently harder, everything else being equal).  Aggro is just a way to make sure you can't win too fast without giving mob ridiculous amount of HPs.  No one seemed to even care about aggro in Luclin because who cares how much aggro you have if a fight lasts 20 minutes?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think I've ever read a post containing more incorrect information.<br />
<br />
Knights already tank better than Warriors in most of the content players are using. They have vastly superior aggro and for all practical purposes match their HP's.<br />
<br />
When Knights achieved this exp group tanking superiority, previous content was not adjusted. Afaik, the only recent content changes have been nerfing AE stuns in the PoWater boss fight, changing the type of some mobs in the predominatly undead LDon zones,  and I think a stealth nerf of snare in PoFire to discourage kiters.<br />
<br />
Paladins with 9500HP's and superior aggro control has not required retuning previous content. Au contraire, content specificly designed to give Paladins MORE opprotunity to MT has been created.<br />
<br />
After Maximum HP's exceeds the amount healed by a CH it becomes a buffer that helps prevent a player from being 1 rounded or killed before the next CH lands.<br />
<br />
Increasing Warrior Maximum HP's would not require changes to existing content.<br />
<br />
Increasing Warrior aggro abilities to approach those of the other plate wearing classes would not require changes to existing content.<br />
<br />
The Warrior = baseline class concept  was probably true at one time. However this has evolved into a tremendous marginalization of the Warrior Class.<br />
<br />
In my view, Warriors should be the preminent Tank with superior survivability and aggro control to perform that task. Paladins should be the preminent Tank/Cleric and SK's the Tank/Necro. What has evolved is the survivability gap has narrowed so much that with superior aggro abilities and all the rest of their powerful spells, Knight are overwhelmingly prefered in experiance groups.<br />
<br />
Increasing Warrior maximum HP's and aggro control does not reverse nerf Knights or require changes to encounters. That is propaganda from those wishing to retain as many advantages over Warriors as possible.<br />

<br />
Aggro control on bosses is already trivial.  Increasing aggro control would have very little effect on raid encounters.  Even if it did significantly effect raid encounters it would be trivial to flag &quot;raid bosses&quot; immune to any improved warrior aggro control.<br />
<br />
The disparity is in xp group tanking.  Knights tank just as well or better than warriors in XP groups due to their ability to buff and heal themselves as well as mitigate damage through stuns.  If warriors have crappy aggro control because the best tank is supposed to have the worst aggro control then for XP groups knights should have worse aggro control than warriors do because they require less healing in an xp group.</div></div><hr />

As far as nerfing goes I agree with a couple on this thread that said there shouldn't be any nerfing.  The main problem they need to fix for warriors as I see it is the random melee generated aggro.  And maybe make hate procing weapons really proc as much hate as they indeed say said weapons do.  Something that procs 800 hate shouldn't be less aggro then one stun, that I agree with.  <br />
<br />
Basically nerfing knights will do practically nothing for warriors except other classes calling you whiners for calling for a nerf.</div></div><hr />

You miss the obvious counter to your point ...<br />
<br />
If no upgrades are coming, then the only way to BALANCE things are through negatives. To the class that is overpowered.<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll still have all the same problems &quot;<br />

But now you'll share in the problems, and the game will be slightly more balanced.<br />

The entire monk community may beg to differ on that statement.<br />
<br />
&quot;And my point was why call for a nerf instead of pushing harder for upgrades?&quot;<br />
<br />
Because everytime someone says, hey, let's upgrade ... a whole group of players stops by to say that upgrades like that will TRIVIALIZE content, or whatever other innane argument they can think of.<br />
<br />
It's simple. There are two choices ... 1- UPGRADE melees. 2- NERF non-melees. <br />
<br />
Both choices large groups of players hate.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hence my running around in circles analogy.<br />

Increase the damage up to around say 60 or so for a 65, allow it for all warrior races using a shield or not, decrease its recycle time, make it completely unresistable even to immune mobs, and increase its chances of hitting. Warriors would then have a very useful unique to their class ability that would give them more reliable aggro AND would most likely decrease the DPS of mobs they are tanking slightly as well as give them a rather useful anti-caster role, even increasing their DPS a bit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
everyone is nerf happy,thats not even  the way to balance a class.I play a paladin as a main, and i also have a 55 warrior that i enjoy playing as well. I saw where someone remarked &quot;take away the aggro effects of utility spells such as snare, and stun. First off since when does a pally get snare, and snare has no aggro. And paladins have always gotten stun spells you warriors never complained about them in kunark or pre kunark days /shrug. Now, i do agree that warriors need a little something to boost them back up as tanking kings, but that doesnt mean you have to nerf a paladin's or sk's ability to do the job as well. Maybe something like allow warriors to have a summon ability like a lot of higher level warrior mobs do ,of course have a reuse timer on it, but hey, it could still come in handy in getting the mob off a chanter or cleric.also, increase a warriors' innate regen some to help increase the mana efficiency of clerics with a warrior tanking. Allow warriors to enrage,increase the chances of a quad, etc. thats how we you should look at  helping the warrior instead of screamin for nerfs. The aggro effects of some spells I.E stuns and flash of light etc are very usefull, sometimes they are the only way to peel aggro off a chanter that just tashed and had to cast a slow 4 times due to resists, take that away and now you still have a problem. Take away the dmg dealing and absorption of knights and they basically become a ranger with no dps, now how much sense does that make? I have also seen posts discussing the gear issue, &quot;a warrior should not have to pay 200k for gear to allow them to hold aggro as well as blah blah&quot; why not? if a knight wants the ac or hp to make him/her a viable tank they have to as well as purchase spells that get pretty damn expensive at higher levels, especially pure casters, ie my enchanter has to spend like 50k to get all of  his lvl 60 spells. so you want a  warrior to be able to walk into a group wearing fine steel weilding a rusty  bastard sword kicking ass and taking  names? The name os the  game has always been gear, he who has the better gear is the better man for the job, always been that way,prolly always will.Alot of the problem i see is also ability of the person behind the computer. Just last night as a matter of fact, a group i was in did a hard adventure in mistmoor, group was 56 chanter, 62 cleric,59 pally (me) 57 warrior 59 ranger. the warrior was tanking, was holding aggro even thru  tash/slows/disempowering/dots thrown by chanter. SOOOOO, if he can do it, then why cant the rest? hes not super twinked in his gear, hell he has an orc fang earring in one slot, no epic, nothing fancy.SO i suggest everyone just take into concideration the previous state of the knight  and where they are now and where warriors are, then make a logical non nerfing idea of how to make the warrior better instead of making other classes suffer from your shortsightedness</div></div><hr />

You're right, paladins don't have snare.  But Shadow Knights do and it does infact cause good aggro when used.  <br />

Go read the shaman board and see what they think (an impartial group of slowers who are interested in keeping the game fun).<br />
<br />
Alot of them think Palladings are overpowered.<br />

I'm not one to say nerf you guys.  I think that warriors should be upgraded to further trivialize the game (because that's waht everyone wants so lets just do it).<br />

Right now the game goes DPS &gt; Healing &gt; Utility &gt; Tanking in my opinion.  For most experience groups a Beastlord or Ranger can tank just fine, for a few you need a knight and warriors are mostly broken because of aggro though there are plenty of groups that still thrive with a warrior tank.  The heavy hitting DPS classes are probably the most powerful, bards have to be up there, shamans and beastlords are both way up there for overall class power.  The healers, knights and lower end DPS classes are in the middle and the pure melee are on the bottem.  No way in heck do I agree that paladins or SK's are overpowered in anyway compared to the average class, especially when you have BL's and rangers out there MTing in groups, adding as much or more utility and adding more DPS.<br />
<br />
I don't think any class is so out of control that they need a heavy nerf, a few classes just need a boost up.  Thats all looking at class vs class balance.  If you want to talk class vs environment than almost every class needs a major nerf.</div></div><hr />

If I could have I would have quoted the rest of Ender's post.  Despite what most everyone thinks Paladin's are not the real reason warriors are having a hard time finding groups.  <br />
