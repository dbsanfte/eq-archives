<br />
1) On friday we were running to RS and mpg went into crash loop mode.<br />
2) On saturday Qvic locked up as soon as we engaged Cyno.<br />
3) After Qvic we went to Time. Start P2 and Time B locks as soon as we pull Rallos Enork whatever in undead trial. Everyone disconnected. This repeated on next try, same pull.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Supposedly it's due to a bug with DoN tasks and if anyone has any active tasks during the raid it will crash you.  I have no clue where my guild raid leader got that info from but we certainly did crash several times trying to do the encounter.  It's possible that has something to do with it but I only break computers, I don't program them so I don't really know.</div></div><hr />

This is added to the pile? Anyone with more info?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Warhead42</div><div class="date">02-28-2005, 01:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">On friday, my guild was doing the Dust ring in Plane of Air to complete our Xegony key.  The zone crashed as we were clearing to the Avatar after we spawned him.  Frustrating, a lot of time down the drain for a lot of people.<br />
<br />
I don't know of anyone in the raid had a shared task open, but we'd been in the zone with the raid force for a good 4 hours before it crashed.  Oh well, we'll complete our key next time we're on rotation.</div></div><hr />
