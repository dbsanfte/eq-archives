<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SupportTank</div><div class="date">07-15-2004, 12:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As of todays patch my top hits have been increased 20 hp.  This includes normal hits as well as crits.  I have not yet been in zerker mode to see if crips are affected but i suspect they are.<br />
<br />
<br />
has anyone else seen this or am i just being blessed with extra damage all by myself?<br />
<br />
I   was using my fabled exe axe most of the day so i don't have exact numbers on my other weapons.<br />
<br />
yesterdays old top normal hit was 411<br />
<br />
post patch normal top hit is 431<br />
<br />
while at this time this is Strickly a observation with nothing really concrete to back it up.  my top Crits seems to occur alot less frequantly then prepatch.  i note this since i can't seem to remember seeing a single top crit today.  which is a tad odd since i can easyly hit 2k attack. i usualy sit around 1800.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dathtoal</div><div class="date">07-15-2004, 12:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My max hits went up 20 points also.  Pre-patch, my max BoW crits were 528.  Now they are 548.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I exped a lot today, I didnot NOTICE an increase in max hit, but I wasn't paying very careful attention though. The monk on the other hand was about giddy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For me (a rogue using 1hp/1hb setup), my max hits are unchanged.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mistiv</div><div class="date">07-15-2004, 02:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">they messed up quite a bit in this patch. but it was a huge patch and didnt mess up anything that was killer.  <br />
<br />
on a side note would people quit posting non high end things in the high end forum. 3 today whee!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">07-15-2004, 02:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">it's linked to the AA. they refund the AA sytem within this patch and lots of bug came along. see this HP mystery post and Brenlo explication here (http://p202.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showMessage?topicID=19994.topic)<br />
looks like the HP / Domage / Focus / ... AA are not working correctly.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cm66</div><div class="date">07-15-2004, 09:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ya the problem was that , Strengthening Strike was adding damage to all of our melee abilities..not just Bash/slam/kick...monks have a AA similiar to this..and this is why it was only affecting a few classes. And the HP issue was b/c they messed up durability but its suppose to all be fixed now with todays emergancy patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Injektilo</div><div class="date">07-15-2004, 01:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Strikethough has been going off for me in an insanely large amount, dunno if thats a bug with the patch also heh.  Im literally seeing about 20-30 strikethrough messages in almost every fight, its like constant spam :/<br />
<br />
Before the patch i was lucky to see like 5 a day ;p</div></div><hr />
