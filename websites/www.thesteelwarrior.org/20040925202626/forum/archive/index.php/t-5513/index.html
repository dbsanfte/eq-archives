<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i know that the video and audio take more then 10-20 min, you need to listen to all of it, the firefigher tape is partically damning</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">This guy doesn't deserve the time I put into reading this, but I did anyway.<br />
<br />
The only fires are on the 7th and 12th floors and are so small they could have been put out by the office sprinkler system <br />
<br />
Appearently he didn't read the entire report (or he's ignoring this to make his &quot;argument&quot; better).  It states quite clearly that the water main providing water for the area (including the building, and the primary source of hook up for the fire fighters) was damaged early in the day.  Not to mention, there were reports of fires on other floors, and you can't judge the fire in the entire building from seeing one side.  If you go through chapter 5 of the report (the chapter on WTC7), you will see a ton of smoke coming from the building, especially black smoke from the area where 2 of the transfer trusses were, which was close to a diesel line, and above.  If transfer trusses 1 or 2 collapsed, it would have collapsed the building as it was shown to.  They did say they aren't positive as to the cause of the collapse, since it is not known, and most likely won't be positively known (due to the circumstances, it is a very difficult case).  This guy appearently thinks he's much smarter than the team of investigators and scientists who are trained to do this stuff. :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Anyway, this guy is an overreacting idiot, not worth the time to listen to.  Though I did find reading the report interesting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I was in NYC that day...I actually walk by the WTC still every morning going to work.<br />
<br />
1. The area in question is alot more compact than you would be led to believe by maps/tv etc....there really wasn't alot of distance spread between the those buildings.  I guess the best analogy I can give you is if you visit NYC go to the Empire State bldg and stand across the street on 6th ave.  You will be very very cognizant of how much bldg looms over you...the WTC actually loomed a hella lot more.<br />
<br />
2. the DB building is still standing but has a 25 story long by 20-30 foot deep gash running through.  The forces at work on 911 really were beyond comprehension...its hard to explain unless you were there and can see the before/after picture first hand.  Bldg 7 fell because it was hit hard...it was fully engulfed by flame before its collapse...sorry to the guy in the article who claims otherwise..... but it was.<br />
<br />
3.  Noone knew this was coming.   To claim someone &quot;blew it up&quot; for insurance money is kinda x-files. Even if someone wanted to move that much high explosives there logistically it was impossible.  Nothing moved North-South that day in the city...imagine the worst traffic jam you have ever seen X100.<br />
<br />
Any way not tryin to be a dork just this kinda crap still makes me mad.</div></div><hr />

bush is NOT a mastermind. the man almost chocked to death on a freaken pretziel!<br />
i honestly wouldnt put it past some one to devise a way to eliminate iraqi power, open the middle east oil trade, and find a way for the majority of the american people to feel justified in doing so, but saying that 9-11 was staged is either a rediculas jump in logic, or the greatest conspircy ever concieved that it actaully discredits it self.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Eh, just a few more points since I'm bored.<br />
<br />
When exactly did they have time to put those charges in to take down the building?  The article claims that it could have been done during safety drills in the previous weeks, but that would require previous knowledge that the incidents of 9/11 were going to happen.  So how about after the attacks?  Well, considering that two buildings have collapsed with emergancy personel inside, and the fact that they didn't have enough water to fight the fire inside, I can't imagine anyone would risk their lives to plant explosives.<br />
<br />
Also, the claim was that you could see the charges going off.  I watch that video many times and I saw zero explosions.  Some windows darkened as the building began to collapse.  A collapse doesn't immediately happen, especially in a situation like the one suggested by the FEMA report.  Instead, the damaged area begins to collapse, and it gradually moves up through the building (happens quickly, but it does go in order).  The inside collapsing could have easily caused the darkening of the windows.<br />
<br />
Next, there were no explosions near the base, where charges are usually put to assist in the bringing down of the building.  Only having charges a few stories up on the building is not common practice for bringing buildings down.<br />
<br />
He also claims that the buildings should have fallen over like the other video he showed.  That is a complete fallacy for this situation.  Especially with the belief that two of the transfer trusses were the weak spot, simple physics says that it would basically implode.  For a building to fall over, it would require being damaged on the bottom of one side.  This would be common with a car bomb if it has enough explosive.<br />
<br />
As for the video where the guy says &quot;pull it&quot;, first I have to say that I can't accurately judge how it was intended.  The video was not long enough to give us the context in which he meant it.  Frankly I do not trust the editing of a person who has an agenda to prove.  He could have just as easily meant that the firefighters would pull back with the attempt to salvage the building, which would lead to watching it collapse as mentioned in the video.  So why would he agree with them to stop trying to save his building?  In the video he says that the firefighters told him that they did not think they could stop the fire, and especially since there had been a such a loss of life that day, he didn't think they should risk theirs for a lost cause.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">he wasnt saving the building, the esbestose in the building caused them to come under fire by health officals and they would have been condemd, recking them or replacing the insulation would have bankrupted the owner, what better way to get ride of this problem then to blow em up in a way that would be a valid claim on a insurance plan.<br />
<br />
eh, ive seen enough to know the truss and gravity stuff is bullshit, and they have to had fallen somehow, this is the best explanation ive heard.<br />
<br />
the &quot;under its own weight&quot; explanation doesnt really match what we saw, we would have seen it pause at each floor and continue to plow down, and the sizomographs would have seen the biggest activity when it all hit the ground, not while it was falling in midair and being blown appart.<br />
<br />
also i question why the rubble was thrown off like it was, if it was gravity they would have head tward the ground more instead of being thrown half a block.<br />

<br />
just saying, whichever you choose to go with, there are flaws in the explaination<br />
<br />
as for how the bombs got in, they had the towers using reduced staff for several weeks before as well as having drills in that time, also, alot of the office stuff (chairs, desks) where replaced with new REALLY cheap plastic furnature, im thinking that is how they got the bombs in, perhaps sticking C4 on or in them untill they were placed<br />
<br />
oh husser  &quot;could have&quot; is the key in that statment, he was trying to show you how small or light the fires where, the trucks still had water, thats what all the &quot;lines&quot; where about mentioned in the firefighter tape, they where working waterlines and hoses up to be used, at least that is my gather.<br />
<br />
excuse spelling i typed this up really quickly<br />
<br />
edit: i do agree we wont find out what happend because alot of the evidance is out of reach, the steel smelted, the rubble was taken to a private lot and covered in concrete, the other tapes classified /shrug<br />
<br />
no way to test to see if the steel melted, if there were chemical traces of bombs or just weak steel<br />
<br />
as a side note about fires, thick black smoke normally shows the fire is being smothered from not enough air, and at that point its burning cooler, and steel acts as a good conducter so the whole tower skeleton would have to be heated up</div></div><hr />

<br />
 Laws of physics.<br />
<br />
 The initial explosion isn't confined to the floor/floors the building hit on, the blast radius travels out in a well defined spherical pattern. Had you actually been inside at impact+5, you probably would have seen a hole reaching about 5 stories each way, and consequent structural damage on each of those floors.<br />
<br />
 Secondly, although the building are very load bearing, the load they're bearing is supposed to be very stable and the architects had to build it a certain way to get it that high and stay in one piece. Fuck with the supports, it all goes bang. Playing Jenga will teach you all you need to know about that one. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
 Not necessarily.<br />
<br />
 Remember, the building, after it started imploding, wasn't all in one piece. Every piece that banged together on the way down dispersed a bit of that kinetic energy. That's why you get odd things like that piece of the facade that was still together even when it all hit the ground - by your logic it should all have been pulverized into dust.<br />
<br />
 As far as the building itself imploding, they're built to do just that. This isn't a Godzilla movie, they can't afford to have 100+ story buildings falling over sideways in ANY city. It's pretty obvious what happened, really, and the only people arguing otherwise are those who let CoNSpiRAcY ThEOrY get in the way of basic principles of motion. :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
You miss the biggest part of all about this.  That would require that they knew 9/11 was going to happen.<br />
<br />
since when does a building with fire damage impload rather than topple? that fire must have evenly heated and damaged the building hehe <br />
<br />
First, it wasn't an actual implosion.  It just toppled in on itself.  Evenly heat the entire building?  No, it would NOT need to.  Primary and important trusses in the middle that get heated to the point they buckle will cause the middle to collapse, which would bring the rest down in on itself.  And I already explained about falling over.  That would require the damage to have removed an important part on one side which would push that side down, pulling the rest down with it.  The middle going out would NOT go sideways.<br />
<br />
the &quot;under its own weight&quot; explanation doesnt really match what we saw, we would have seen it pause at each floor and continue to plow down, and the sizomographs would have seen the biggest activity when it all hit the ground, not while it was falling in midair and being blown appart. <br />
<br />
Who said under it's own weight?  Lets go back to the basics.  Heat makes metal soften.  A fire under the trusses makes them begin to buckle, not just it's weight.  And no, it wouldn't pause.  The bottom would crash to the ground, and the above floors begin crashing down.  It's not one big crash at the end, it's a continous crash, which can cause more shaking at one point depending on when and where the heavier parts are hitting the ground.  It doesn't happen instantly, but it doesn't do it one at a time with a pause either.<br />
<br />
still, the most kenetic energy would be when its all coming down correct? <br />
<br />
Nope.  The energy will be hitting the ground the entire time as it comes down.  That would be right if it all landed at once, but not in this situation where all of it is landing over the time it takes for the entire building to land.<br />
<br />
eh, ive seen enough to know the truss and gravity stuff is bullshit, and they have to had fallen somehow, this is the best explanation ive heard <br />
<br />
Nope.  The MIDDLE is collapsing, not the side.  Once the metal is soft, it easily collapses.<br />
<br />
gravity stuff is bullshit <br />
<br />
Look, I can be like the guy who wrote the article and claim that you are saying gravity doesn't exist.  My point is that he often takes things out of context, and see how easy it is to come up with lies that way?<br />
<br />
he was trying to show you how small or light the fires where <br />
<br />
You can NOT tell the size of a fire by looking at one side.  Trying to show that with a picture on one side is idiotic bullshit.  For a real look, read the report, and see the intensity of the smoke they have pictures of.  Just because it doesn't look like much in one place does NOT mean that it is small and can't cause the amount of heat needed.  Based off the amount of smoke coming from the entire building, there was more than enough fire.<br />
<br />
also i question why the rubble was thrown off like it was, if it was gravity they would have head tward the ground more instead of being thrown half a block <br />
<br />
Nope.  Think about this.  You have all this building collapsing towards the middle.  All of this material is hitting around the center at the bottom.  This stuff is coming down with a lot of force, pushing air and other material further.  When it hits the ground, it can't continue to push air and such down, thus it goes out.  And debris now gets pushed out in all directions.  Simple physics.<br />
<br />
the trucks still had water <br />
<br />
Trucks simply can not carry the amount required to stop a fire in a building as large as that, especially since they've been fighting fires on several buildings previous.  And the FEMA report states that the water main to the area was broken from previous damage.  I'll trust them over the infowars idiot.<br />
<br />
steel acts as a good conducter so the whole tower skeleton would have to be heated up <br />
<br />
While the heat does transfer to other parts, the steel in the immediate area will be a hell of a lot hotter than anywhere else, and it takes a long time to for it to transfer over such distances.  There is also the effect of air.  The air around the other parts of the steel is cooler than the hot steel which is heating up other areas.  The air cools the steel, whereas with the area with the fire, the air is also heating the steel.  This leads to really hot in one spot, and much cooler in other places.  The other places would be hotter, but not largely so, and at a certain distance, the heat would stop reaching.<br />
<br />
btw i couldnt see the explotions in the video eather(the quility of internet video is crap) so i went out and got a few documentrys on it and if you freeze them they do show it, its really damn hard to see <br />
<br />
Are you sure it's an explosion?  Fire flaring up can look like it.  Fire hitting an area with a lot of fuel (be it gas, papers, whatever) would cause a large amount of fire suddenly, which can look like an explosion.  Also, an explosion is basically an object succumbing to massive internal pressure, it could be a room with closed doors breaking open, etc, etc.<br />
<br />
i bet you think ive had to much speed huh? <br />
<br />
Don't start playing the &quot;No one believes me, thus my conspiracy must be true&quot; type bullshit card.  People love playing that one, where everything against them is simply because their opinions are disliked by certain people and we're just following suit.  It's the same card Zhenobia was pulling, and it's just plain bullshit.  But beyond that, I think you are reading too much of this idiots articles.  Sure, some things look like it just might be right, but it's all speculation with ZERO actual proof.  Just because some of the pieces fit, doesn't mean the puzzle is completed that way, especially when many of the pieces have been painted and shoved where they don't fit.<br />

<br />
Is 100% correct.  Building are designed to fall in on themselves if they are going to collapse, instead of outwards, to try to limit the amount of colateral damage.  Obviously it's not always gonna work, but it does often.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">eh id like to argue your points but i cant do it all that effectivly, you all know how articlate i am hahah, that line about speed tho wasnt some nut ball card, it was a joke at my own expense because i dont take myself to seriusly these days</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">off topic a little; but WTC 1 and 2 weren't conventional steel buildings like most of the others in NYC.<br />
<br />
they were floating trusses built over an internal skeleton ( unlike most steel buildings with a rigid exoskeleton ) which made WTC 1 and 2 more open and spacious but more susceptible to heat transfer(s) and weight distribution and in extreme cases aren't as structually sound due to massive temperature changes.<br />
<br />
shock and stress loading is shifted from removing pieces of the puzzle ( trusses basically are repitious patterns of material designed to carry loads instead of using solid members ) and more than likely IMHO the 'shock' of the crash itself didn't cause the collapses ( it was designed to take the hit of an airplne at i's time of construction ); but the ensuing truss failure(s) and excessive heat and warpage of the internal framework caused it to collapse inward upon itself because it's main point of loding 'was' the center of the building and once the pieces gave way....<br />
<br />
<br />
( i hope my reply isn't taken as inflammatory; just some random tidbits of info on building(s) )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">already read about the truss before i made this post, was a report from some colledge in washington state, tho i still beleave it was blow up im not that good at making articlate posts so i wont try hehe, but i really question if that fire was hot enough to do that, the jetfuel would have burned up right away, and alot of it blown out in the fireball of the crash.</div></div><hr />
