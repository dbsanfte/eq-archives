<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nettor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">ive been looking around and the warrior epics arent exactly the best swords out there, there is plenty better swords i could buy.whats your opinion on this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Marduka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Epic is just worth the fancy look.<br />
<br />
Edit: typo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kilzalot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Epic ist just worth the fancy look.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Froggerx Xreggorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">and not to mention the small sense of achievement you get for completing one of the hardest quests in the game. (even though its truly not that hard anymore)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Azaza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you've been collecting pieces gradually, have the means to get the harder pieces (PoSky blade, Chardok Queen blade, Ball in Fear, arguably the scales), and they're actually an upgrade.... go for it.<br />
<br />
Generally, EP level and higher players have better weapons to use over the epic. Below that it's just a matter of preference whether people actually want it.<br />
<br />
I use the 2h and red blade regularly and I'm not complaining. It took me a long time to get the various pieces, and I'm happy to have gotten it.<br />
<br />
But there are several (relatively) easier to obtain, headache free, better weapons out there.<br />
<br />
As long as you can do your job, that's what matters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Alisdahre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Nice to get them for sentimental reasons.  If you just wanted to finish the quest to say you did and have something fancy looking to show for it.<br />
<br />
Functionaly though, you're already wielding far superior weapons.  Copper Hammer and Bloodsworn blow the epics away in both DPS and aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Only reason to get epic other than fashion/nostalgia is epic 1.5/2.0.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Brabble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Whatcha do is, help a some of your guildie clerics and druids get their epics. Then when the fourth or fifth one finishes and the rounds of /cheer die down a bit, you say<br />
/guild Okay, so we're going to get my warrior epic now, right?<br />
<br />
I haven't actually done the &quot;/guild Okay...&quot; part of this, but my guess is that there would be a really fun moment of silence where no one says anything in /guild until you told them you were just kidding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Haw, Brabble!!<br />
<br />
One of our monks did that. We smacked down Faydedar or something, and people were high-fiving like we'd accomplished something ubah, then our poor monk suggested we go to Chadok to camp Iksar Betrayer.<br />
<br />
There was a long period of silence.<br />
<br />
Then somebody suggested we go do an LDoN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">That having been said, you'll see in my magelo bank slots that all I need for my epic is, well, the three most difficult pieces.<br />
<br />
I just don't see myself getting the forces together to go spank named golems in PoHate for weapons I'll equip only when I'm chillin' in the PoK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Galdaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The epics are pretty much useless at this point, however if they can be used to upgrade to epic 1.5/2.0, then it might be worth your while.  I put mine off for a very long time and just accumulated the pieces over time.  I eventually picked up darn near everything while helping others.  The ball of golem on a Fear raid for someone...maybe a shaman or necro epic, the spiroc wingblade while heading up to the next isle for the mage epic, the queen blade while down taking out the king for the cleric epic, etc.  Once pieces started to accumulate, I went ahead and finished the thing and it has been accumulating dust ever since that time.  Hopefully, it will have some use when the 1.5/2.0 versions of the epics are released.</div></div><hr />
