<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Callon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">From what I hear the Guardian of the Seal spawns where Yael use to in the Hole.  That's a big zone, so I was wondering if anyone knows whether a ranger can track this mob from zone in or not?  If not, how far in do they have to go?  I guess a level 1 Brell rogue might have a chance of getting back there still, but all the way to Yael's old area is a pain.  Something would probably splat ya along the way.<br />
<br />
Also, are the constructs on the same spawn timer as the Guardian?  Or do they spawn more often and thus can be up without the guardian?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Not sure about those constructs, but get a level 1 cleric and DA suicide him in there to check if he's up</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Neksnappa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Make a level 1 erudite SK, and jump into the hole, as far away from the newbie ground/tox zone area as you can get. Should be to your right as you come up the elevator out of the actualy city. If you find the right place, you can land in the pond at the bottom, and not die. The guardian and the two gargoyles should be right there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Snowz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">From my personal experience, jumping into the Hole from any angle or location is null. Once you zone into the actual Hole, you are basically centered and will fall to your death, unless you DA with a Cleric. Now this could have been changed, it has been a while since I did the jump.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">As far as I can tell guardian and guards pop together; I check this pretty much every night and have never seen guards w/o guardian (note if you do the encounter use 3 tanks its really the easiest way).<br />
<br />
I used a lvl 1 erudite cleric with DA.  Go to Hole...hit DA... jump and insta watcher.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Make a cleric and DA jump.  The Guardian isn't KoS.  Hell, even if he was, it wouldn't matter anyway.  If he killed ya, at least you'd know he's up.<br />
<br />
Strategy!<br />
<br />
First you must pull his guards.  A lot of people say they're unsplittable, but that's farce.  I used to think that myself honestly.  Guardian will assist his guards if you try and FD pull him, so that's a bad, bad idea.  So, what do you do?  It's easy.  His guards split like cakewalk if you pet pull them using an SK/Necro.  The guard on Guardian's right is a cleric who drops the pieces for the Reactivate the Portals quest.  The guard on Guardian's left is a wizard who drops the ore for the Strength of the Elements quest.  Easy peezy, but the guards have a lot of HP.<br />
<br />
Guardian of the Seal has almost no HP.  I'm serious, he only has about 80-100k hp.  I kill him with 6-7 people a lot and he usually dies about the time my Defensive drops.  However, he makes up for this with his FEROCIOUS damage output.  He quads for upper 900's and has very high ATK.  In Defensive, his max is upper 600's.  He *is* 40% Disease slowable, but don't think that by slowing him he's going to instantly become a walk in the park.  To put it into perspective, I pull Guardian with Incite and immedietly hit /Furious.  My friend, who plays a shaman, slows him as quickly as possible and I resume with /Defensive the moment /Furious drops.  Even slowed, druid debuffed, and in /Defensive, my CH's often land for 7k+, and yes I chain them.<br />
<br />
Once Guardian reaches 30% health, he's going to change from being black steel to a whitish rock.  His DPS remains the same, but now he has a grav flux proc that sends you in the direction that he's facing and does some damage as well.  This is resistable if you have high enough MR, but normally that's not always the case.  Your healers can avoid this!  Since the zone is indoor, the AE's don't go through the walls.  When you're staring directly at Guardian, look to your right.  You're going to see a little cove where the old Nortlav used to be.  You can corner tank Guardian in that corner and have your healers around the corner on the 90 degree angle wall.  It's long, but CH will reach and the grav flux won't hit the healers if they're standing there.<br />
<br />
Guardian always drops two loots and occassionally drops the book for the Reactivate the Portals quest along with it as a third drop.  His most common drops are the uber earring and the shoulders.  The FT2 gloves and bitchin ring are far, far more rare unfortunetly.  :(<br />
<br />
DPS on this guy:<br />
Unslowed -  1000+ dps<br />
Slowed/Debuffed -  400-600dps  (More than Vindi)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Callon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">cool, thanks for all the info.  <br />
<br />
Eriatha, what do you mean by pet pull?  I'm a warrior so I don't have any experience with this concept.  Though I'm not too concerned about the constructs.  I think my guild could fairly easily offtank them with a druid healing the tanks while everyone else worries about the Guardian.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Tried this guy twice the other day but we just weren't on our game I guess.  Wiped the first time @ 2% and the second time @ 1%.  God that sucks!  Both times, however, he did about 380dps to me in Defensive and 40% Slowed.  I didn't live past Defensive unfortunetly.  :(<br />
<br />
He's mean as hell alright.  I've tanked/healed Vindi before plenty of times and I can tell you Guardian &gt; Vindi, easily.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gharghael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thank you for that info Eriatha. I've wanted to do the strength of the elements quest, but this fight has always sounded intimidating because I didn't think the guardian's compadres could be pulled separately from himself and each other. I'm just under 7k buffed - would the wizard guard be something I could do with one solid group?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yep!<br />
<br />
The guards have a lot of HP, but they're by no means hard and easily one groupable.  Grab an SK/Necro friend, have them FD with a pet up, and pet pull them.  Ore drops every time off the wizard guard, which is the one on Guardian's left.<br />
<br />
Easy peezy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>zito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Ummm off topic, but... that's a verrah nice BoW there Eriatha, grats to ya ! :)<br />

<br />
Aye, easily.  The guards don't hit hard, but they do have a ton of HP.  Thankfully they don't run/gate.  The cleric guard will heal himself, so it'll be a tad bit longer fight then the wizard.  Thankfully the group can just stand there way off to the side while the puller does his work.  If Guardian agros, which happens if you pet pull too close, at least only the puller dies, hehe.</div></div><hr />

I doubt the halfling rogue would make it down there.  The golems are notorious for seeing through normal sneak/hide along with shroud of stealth.  You'll usually run into 1-2 golems on the way down to the Guardian that see through SoS.  I could barely solo 1 golem as a  65 rogue and with 8000hp/1700ac.. 4% aa per kill though!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Callon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">trying this guy very soon when we can find him up.  can anyone please explain what pet pulling is?  Send pet in, FD, and he doesn't aggro any adds or something?  I'm not a pet caster and am not sure how this would work exactly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Aurthur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">It's something only an SK or Necro can do.  If you don't have one, then you may need to come up with a fancier pulling method like double-tagging monks or coth yo-yo's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">off tank is easier and quicker. but you have to have a sk/necro pull with the pet and they fd. then someone tag when far enough away.<br />
<br />
Ok I tried tanking this guy( usually not MA) and first two times wipe. not whole like half. so we click up. GL decides to let her pally try... no luck. now finally a shaman logs on. i get fully buffed we engage slowed dead one death (ranger so it's all good).<br />
<br />
Slow is huge. use furious/fortitude followed by defensive</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Callon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Well, we tried the FD pet pull thing yesterday.  We mucked it up.  It looked like it was working at first and we all started killing the construct he pulled back by Nortlav.   I think the SK may have stood up though as the guardian and the other construct suddenly added.  Our healers weren't ready and we were totally out of position.  I'd intended to corner the guardian as suggested here and never had the chance.  So when he started grav fluxing, people were flying everywhere.  The heals didn't come in well after the fluxes started, so I died when he was at 20 some odd percent.  It was FAR from flawless, but nevertheless, we nuked him down and won.  Next time it will be easier.<br />
<br />
Someone mentioned tanking him apparently with 1 cleric healing.  You must be a far, far better geared tank than I am, which isn't hard to do if you're in a high end guild.  I have maxed defensive AAs and had around 8100 hit points/1450-1500 AC at the time.  There was no way in hell I'd be tanking him with 1 cleric...  not even close at all.  The DPS was way too high even with defensive up.  Also our shaman tried many times to stick slow and I'd said before the fight to just use Disease slow.  I don't think the slow ever stuck.  A shaman mentioned being resisted 9 times in a row.  I know someone tashed.  I assume a shaman malo'ed.  Beyond that, I don't know, but that thing wasn't slowed.<br />
<br />
Decent drops and I finished the strength of the elements quest... so it was messy but successful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I tank this guy with one cleric, but I'm casting it back to back nonstop.  I only have 8700hp and 1710ac fully raid buffed, but I usually only get to engage Guardian with 8350hp and 1650ish AC due to available buffs.<br />
<br />
Dobbo pretty much hit the nail.  Start with Furious and click Defensive or Stonewall the moment it drops.  You have to Malicious Decay (Unresistable Disease Debuff) him before you can reliable land slow (Disease only).<br />
<br />
As far as him adding when you pet pulled the guards, you gotta bring the guards back further.  It's tricky, but it can be done.  I usually bring the guards past where Nortlav stands up on the ledge, but don't bring them too close to the door or else the gargoyals on the other side will add.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I would also like to mention... I don't always win when I do this. :p<br />
<br />
Zito was watching when my buddies and I engaged him once and we wiped twice in a row - once at 2% and the second time at 1%.  It's pretty demoralizing, but hey, you get back up on your feet and you simply try again.  My best win to date is with 7:  65 Warrior, Cleric, Rogue, Druid, Shadowknight, and Wizard.<br />
<br />
Druids ATK debuffs are ownage on this guy cause his ATK is so high.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Callon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Dobbo pretty much hit the nail.

<br />
I do furious then defensive on pretty much all raid mobs now.<br />
<br />
I'll ask our shaman about the disease debuff and if he used it.  I bet he didn't think about it.  Good suggestion.  And I have to get on our druids.  I know they have a great attack debuff but I don't think it gets used enough.  We only had one chanter and he tashed and got splatted right at the beginning, so no Cripple could happen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Selucreh Herculian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">We do GoTS everytime he pops.  SK pet pulls each guard.  We have never had a problem splitting these mobs.<br />
<br />
As it has been stated already, I pulls GoTS with incite/bow, go furious, then Def/Stone, corner him and then take him down.  Buffed I am at a tick under 8k in hps and 1450 ac.<br />
<br />
We have done GoTs at least 20 times, down to killing him with 13 peeps fun fight.</div></div><hr />
