<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litlenmean</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What's the best way to do this vxed trial? I've done it like....8 times already and failed everytime...This is the hardest part for me. what's the best recommended group to take in there? <br />
<br />
Litlenmean The Gnomer</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Solanthus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Are you wiping to the mobs? Can you get past the first borer?<br />
<br />
What are your levels, hp, gear, group makeup? Need more detail.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gorthag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah, totally depends on gear... I solod that part w/bots, cleric+chanter+necro+mage+bard bots... keep in mind, thse are triggered mobs when you zone in, dont have a homespawn point. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ODB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Have a bard in group, zone in to trigger the encounter, kill first one. All but bard zone out, bard runs up and aggros the left borer and trains it to the ZI and zones out. Zone in and kill it as it wont path back. Rinse / repeat. That is assuming, of course, that they dont path back still.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litlenmean</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I can get over 8.8k hp buffed...We've killed all three borers and had the main one spawn. We were continuing through the right since we just killed the 3rd one(btw i'm in Harlequin Smile, EP guild atm) and a named got to us and pwned us &gt;.&lt;...So I'll try today with that bard thing you said ODB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>branaelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Warrior<br />
Cleric <br />
Enchanter and/or Bard<br />
<br />
Then add based on the following considerations:<br />
<br />
-If you have an Enchanter you will want somone who can snare so a charmed pet can be used safely.<br />
<br />
-A backup healer is of course good.<br />
<br />
-A backup rez is very good, especially a necro.<br />
<br />
-Evac is good, not only to save from a wipe but to return to zone in after first borerling.<br />
<br />
If I was hand picking a group I would choose:<br />
warrior<br />
cleric<br />
bard<br />
necro<br />
druid<br />
enchanter with charm pet<br />
<br />
You don't usually have such a choice, so just make sure you have a cleric and CC, then add as many of the bonus classes as possible.<br />
<br />
Nothing tricky about the run, just need to keep moving and stay on your toes.  Adds can pop/wander into camp at the worst time, keep camp tight and pay attention.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gorthag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ummm... actually.. bards have this nifty trick called 'Fading Memories'....... no need for rest of group to zone out. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">omg that will make it soooo easy :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It's not that hard to just plain ol' plow, either.  I'm pretty gimpy compared to many on these boards, and had little problem plowing to all 3 plus the named with me, shaman (also me), chanter, wizzy, mage, and cleric - all 65-66 at the time.  Was fun, and decent exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Lesiter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">All 4 borers run faster than the rest of the mobs in the zone.. just have a bard train it down and fade at the entrance.  No zoning required.  Finished mine in about 30 minutes this way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Was that including the last named that spawns ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Durt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Was that including the last named that spawns ?<br />
<br />
Yes - that's exactly how I did mine.  The whole process took about 15 minutes, maybe even less.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Lesiter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Was that including the last named that spawns ?<br />
<br />
Yes.. Bard had to DA train up and DA train back to make it alive, but he managed to get the last named solo to the zonein.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kogur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">If you have the 104k horse/lizard or Emperor/Seru horse you can do this yourself. We cleared to and killed all 3 borelings, then had a run of bad luck with 3 wipes on the way to the Borer. So I got buffed up, got on my lizard and hauled ass. Target the Borer as you are running around the bend, incite/bellow and keep moving. I got hit one time but it stunned me, popped fortitude and kept on running. The druid used exodus by me when I got to the concrete platform.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Armugol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">This part only took about a little over an hour without any charmed pet or such.   Just kill the first one at zone in head left and kill the second evac to the zone.  This time head right. and kill the 3rd and keep going over the bridge.   In total I think we killed about  35-40 mobs.  Only think to watch for is the roamers is you are moving too slow.  <br />
<br />
There is really no trick necessary for this part and the exp was nice also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I just botted a rogue to do it.<br />
<br />
Had bard play selos, ran rogue SoS up to the left borer, targeted, backstabbed for fun, hit Nimble and trained down and zoned out. Zoned back in and borer was on the concrete pad.<br />
<br />
Did this for the right one and the named as well. We were originally going to fight up to the named, but Umbiki spawned right on us and cleric got on rampage and we all died but the bard. He deftdanced to victory and killed the filthy cragbeast after me, the pally, the enchanter and rogue all bit the dust, rofl. You'd be surprised how much stuff does NOT agro when you run past it with selos in Vxed and since notthing assists the borers you don't get mega trains.<br />
<br />
The named hits 1650 max btw on a non warrior. Just had the cleric chain Pious Light on me and used Stonewall. I was hit for ~1086 max and the pally was on rampage, but the borer doesn't start rampaging until around 50-25% health. Whole fight took about 90 seconds and I never went below 50% health.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Hittem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">We took a lot longer to do this for me, but i was botting the bard.<br />
I had trouble getting the bard to the borer and back to the concrete pad near Z/I alive.  What would usually happen is bard would head up, with levi, selo and PR/DR/MR song to prevent the dogs from snaring him.  He would very often get to or near the borer and then have to hit DA to stay alive.  Then he would turn and head to z/i.  The DA would run out and if deftdance wasn't up he would get pasted.   Then we'd port bard back, summon, buff and try to pull borer a little further down.  Took 3-4 tries per borer.  It wasn't fast.<br />
But i'm a gimpy bard player.  Bard is level 70, ~6khp 1300AC ~150aa and botted by me.  YMMV.<br />
Maybe a real bard could do a better job.<br />
In the end I think it would have taken same time to just plow it and you'd be getting XP rather than just bored to tears.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Keep a rezzable corpse at zone in and have the rez box up while you do it. If you are gonna die then take the rez and it wipes you from all hatelists plus its an instant port back to safety.</div></div><hr />

<br />
good suggestion.<br />
thanks bro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Coroq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">If you are having trouble with Vxed I'd say that's a good indicator that you should probably not worry about your epic but instead get level 70s and some AAs. <br />
<br />
Use the same old Vxed/Tipt uber strat of hasted charmed pet and just clear through crushing everything in about an hour tops. Of course if you don't have an ench and a good pet minder along do it the old fashoned way, but it'll take about twice as long.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Wasn't a case of trouble, was a case of not wasting an hour + of my time on a stupid vxed clearing for the 50th time. Rogue + resbox = much easier then clearing heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Litlenmean</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">monk pulled the borer to zi....thanks for the info</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Deckion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">At what point  should i try this ? i dont want to Wste any of my Friends Time.<br />
<br />
My Gear is way out of  date.  Full ToV (dragon faction).  I can how ever get to around 8.6K hp with buffs  Man that new shamen buff is nice too :) <br />
<br />
AC and HP is more of my Concern then any thing else.   How many HP does he have and stuff i can always use Stone wall and Furious to keep the Damage LOW.<br />
<br />
but after that i would just like to.... well survive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I used Stonewall, but the boss barely landed any hits on me, probably because the pally in the group was stun locking it. I'd say he has aroud 100k hp, went down pretty quick, less than 2min to kill with war, bard, cleric, pally, rogue, enchanter. We weren't using any pets either.<br />
<br />
I'll parse the fight when I get home and try to post it here.</div></div><hr />
