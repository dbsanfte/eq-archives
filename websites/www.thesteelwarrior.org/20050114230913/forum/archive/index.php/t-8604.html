<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mearis</div><div class="date">08-23-2004, 11:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi,<br />
<br />
Sorry for the two previous posts, but was trying to figure out how to make a poll, and this software is quite different from that my bulletin board uses.<br />
<br />
I was quite curious to get the opinion of raiders, particularly those in the end game and those who take an active part in leading raids or recruiting for guilds about the requirement for clerics in high end guilds.<br />
<br />
My thoughts are that currently clerics are far too crucial for EQ to be healthy, and rosters/recruitment policies reflect that.  I do think it is also very hard to make interesting events that are not 'gimped' by having an usually high % of clerics though, which makes things relatively hard to balance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aspit</div><div class="date">08-23-2004, 11:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">fine ill post on this one!<br />
<br />
Personally i think requiring 10 clerics on a 54 man raid is retarded, for example the barxt encounter there is a very slim chance of being able to beat it with 6 or less clerics simply because you have 2 3k hitters at once for the first 5 mins. The counter arguement for that is that if only 6 clerics are required for a raid(which is similar to elemental raids when a guild first entered) would make the encounters far too easy. Soe in in the mindset where you either need rape dps on the boss, a few nasty dd or manadrain aes, or a shitload of adds coupled with moderatly heavy melee. Either way a solid part of your raid needs to be clerics. <br />
<br />
As to if requiring 10ish clerics per raid is healthy, absolutely not. Cleric is probably the most boring class in eq to play and very many clerics get burned out. This is why you see every high end guild recruiting clerics at all times. What is eventually going to happen is A the inflow of new clerics dies rapidly, high end guilds cant recruit clerics at the rate that they lose them, high end guilds die, eq dies. Ive seen it many times in high end guilds and heard it from friends in many guilds. They often have to take a few weeks off to backflag and gear cleric apps to the point where they are able to do their job adequately.</div></div><hr />

Atleast in god they have to be more skillful and cope with harder situations. The real issue with clerics is they generally need full attention all the time of the raid, far more than any other class.</div></div><hr />

<br />
BB, I agree with some of what you said, but you didn't adress the main point.<br />
<br />
Do you feel the current amount of clerics required for raiding is balanced?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">08-23-2004, 03:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I is balanced with the numbers of players of the various classes, their persistance at improving their characters, and guild (at least my guild's) staffing.<br />
<br />
Remember that there is a feedback mechanism. If Beserkers have trouble getting into high level raidng guilds, then fewer players roll Beserkers, equip them, get them flagged (or get help from guilds in accomplishing these tasks).<br />
<br />
Yes, I can understand if I were a Beserker asking if there were to many Warriors required on raids and not enough Beserkers.<br />
<br />
Nontheless, Druids (and Shaman to a lesser extent) are in high demand at least on my server. They are not suffering from Cleric overpopularity or a lack of a raid role.<br />
<br />
You feel overrun by too many high level competent flagged Clerics that have invested 4-5 years in their characters and want some to retire? Zebruxoruk, that's Z-E-B.... server. Free beer, free peridots, and yes most guilds will flag your twinks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">brutall</div><div class="date">08-23-2004, 04:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's obviously not, when you have an instance of 54 people with 1/5 or 1/4 clerics to win it's simply not balanced correctly.  When we tested many of the gates instances we would have 11 clerics which is a bad spec to tune from.  <br />
<br />
Their were some very good things in gates to alleviate the need for raw cleric numbers.  Banishing the ma and have lower boss mob dps is a great way to address this. Don't need as many clerics but the ones you have need to be playing well.  Death touching adds in fights accomplishes the same thing,  no healing required for that but increases the difficulty of the encounter by a ton.  <br />
<br />
If they use these types of things and lower boss mob dps raid bosses don't have to be gimp they are more fun for everyone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aspit</div><div class="date">08-23-2004, 04:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">if you think a 54 raid should require 10+ clerics or  18.5% of the raid to be clerics you are fucking retarded.  Could you imagine what a raid leader would do if he saw 10 sks on the raid?  I would probably replace 8 of them right off the bat for a more useful class.  The fact that you need damn near 20% of your raid to be clerics is the most fucking retarded thing ive ever seen.  That being said we really dont have a problem with clerics because most are so bored on blue servers we get a ton of xfers.</div></div><hr />

The same thing is more or less true of Paladins.<br />
<br />
I've no problem at all with SoE making raid encounters that don't require 10 Clerics or 5 Warriors. However that does not necessarily mean that 10 healers with all their healing AA's, deep mana pools, FT15, and healing focus items can't be required. Nor does it mean that 5 Tanks within a few 100 AC or HP's of theoretical maximum at their progression level can't be required.<br />
<br />
All too often threads like this are used to try to drum up support for class blurring or the removal of pure class specialization advantages. Frankly, I've been on successful raids in KT+ without 10 Clerics or 5 Warriors. Those guilds that require more often aren't near the apex of preparedness in the first place.<br />
<br />
It's not a class balance issue. It's an encounter design and ready for the content issue.<br />
<br />
Besides, would you *cough* have a quota system with 1/16th of the spots in every guild going to each class. Or would it be more reasonable for SoE to design content to reflect the percentage of players at each progression level of each class. If there are 500,000 Warriors and 10 Beserkers ready for Uqua, shouldn't Warriors be more needed than Beserkers in Uqua?<br />
<br />
In simple terms you think too much healing, tanking, and damage dealing (giggle) is being done in these encounters and that pure class specialists shouldn't be the best at their narrow focused specialzations.<br />
<br />
BB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khumak</div><div class="date">08-23-2004, 06:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the complaint is more about the fact that SoE is focusing so much on small numbers of bosses with massive DPS output to make encounters difficult rather than designing encounters that require the effective use of a wide range of abilities and classes.  An encounter with 2 bosses that can't be split and both put out 3k DPS is no more difficult than one with a single hard hitting boss plus some mezable and unmezable OT mobs, some of which cast curses, mana drains, dispells, memblurs, etc that have to be countered by a variety of classes.  The difference is that the first encounter requires 2 warriors and 10 or more clerics.  The rest really don't matter, they're just DPS.  The second type requires lots of CC people, lots of healers (notice healers does not mean only clerics), lots of tanks (this includes knights), lots of support classes for cures, refreshing junk buffs, AE heals, etc.<br />
<br />
The first type of fight requires zero effort to design and success is determined by a vary narrow focus on heal timing, aggro control, and how well you have your main tanks geared up.  The second type depends on having a well balanced raid force where everyone is doing their job.<br />
<br />
Requiring 20% of a raid to be clerics is as retarded as requiring 20% of any other class would be.  Changing that does NOT require making shamans or druids or anyone else heal even close to as well as a cleric.  It just requires a little more imagination designing encounters.</div></div><hr />

No, I think he just wants to raid without having to require 7+ clerics in a 54 man raid.  If two warriors are only online you can still get things done, if there are 2 clerics online, well hello Mshas... I can understand why you totally oppose this tho, cause even the idea having more then a couple encounters per expansion that a non specialist could do scares you.  No reason not to design conent that would take minimal healing, still require specialists and the knights/support classes go off and do their add thing.  In any case, your EQ = Booorrring.  If its not a class balance issue, then tell me why can't I raid if I have 4 druids, 3 shamans online but only two clerics?  Oh content issue... hello its those classes missing the healing factor, not the content.  In the era of raid limits and diminishing numbers thoughtout EQ it makes sense that other classes can stepup to the plate and heal effectively when needed.  There is a difference between bluring regarding wars/clerics, warriors only a couple at the min are required but the more entails a safer margin of error, but to even think of raiding highend GoD you need atleast 6+ clerics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rueeliar</div><div class="date">08-24-2004, 01:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would be very interested to see exactly how the encounters are tuned, at this point.  Does SOE tune encounters for peak characters, near the maximum available gear and optimum effects on hand at each point in the game, or are they tuned for a guild where the drops have been even remotely equitable in distribution?<br />
<br />
Was Xxeric tuned to be tanked by a Defensive Warrior at 14k hp and 3k ac?  Was Xxeric tuned to be tanked by a 2.6k AC warrior with 13k hp, with half a dozen 400 dps rogues going full out to kill her before Defensive wears off?<br />
<br />
Are we doing these fights with as many clerics as they expect, or are we always going for a margin of safety and going with two more than is &quot;necessary?&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">08-24-2004, 02:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Khumak,<br />
<br />
I agree that some fights are perhaps too straight forward, particularly things like the Zoo Event.<br />
<br />
Still others are pretty complicated - the most extreme of these I've encountered is Uqua. I don't see however a fixed number of Clerics or Warriors being required for Uqua however. I see a requirement for Tanks with sufficient robustness and X amount of healing distributed among Y Tanks for Z amount of time.<br />
<br />
For every encounter I can think of you need Healers, Tank/s, DPS and perhaps some utility. Is 10 Clerics or 8 Clerics, 3 Druids, and 2 Shaman really unreasonable in a 54 person raid when healing is almost 1 in 3 of the catagories that needs to be filled? I don't think so.<br />
<br />
The real objection here is not really needing 10 Clerics (or 13ish healers), 5 Tanks, and 39 DPS/Utility. It's that some guilds find getting the requisite numbers of healers regularly logging in is a burden or in some cases class jelousy where Mr. Shaman #3 doesn't feel needed as much as Ms. Cleric #6.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Northerner</div><div class="date">08-24-2004, 05:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The real issue, as I see it, is that the penalty for failure is pretty steep in parts of GoD.  I mean that a given encounter is known to be a pretty nasty 30 minute setup and a 90+ minute clearing to target, followed by a rather difficult target event.  We might feel comfortable going after that with 8-10 Clerics but know full well that if the gods are not smiling today, we have a reasonable chance of a wipe at 4-6 Clerics in attendance.  Failure means zero flags, zero loot and zero progression.<br />
<br />
So, instead people look at low Cleric attendance and say gogo Mshas and the like.  Perhaps they run a less healing-stressful raid that's still a little harder but quite likely they don't.  Cleric numbers provide security and officers generally try to take the raidforce into something they feel they are very likely to win or that will be a new milestone for the guild.<br />
<br />
I do agree in some senses that 1/4 to 1/3rd of your raidforce being healers is not in and of itself a horrible thing.  However, when 2-3 shaman or druids cannot really perform the healing functions of a single Cleric, there might well be an issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Timmok</div><div class="date">08-24-2004, 06:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">However, when 2-3 shaman or druids cannot really perform the healing functions of a single Cleric, there might well be an issue.<br />
They probably can, but.. with the raid limit of 54 you need maximum efficiency in each spot. <br />
<br />
So its not attractive to substitute 1 cleric with 2 druids, simply because that takes up a raid spot that could be used on DPS.<br />
<br />
For reference we routinely have 10-11 clerics(including 2-3 bots) on our Tacvi raids, 3-4 druids and 2-3 shamans. Thats 30% of the raid = priests, in our case.</div></div><hr />

As long as that 30% a mixture of clr, dru, shm thats fine, however they aren't even 30% of the class class mixture.  However druids and shm are at serious disadvantage healing compared to a cleric.  This game is still clearly built around clerics healing defensive warriors on boss mobs.</div></div><hr />

That way druids and shamans and paladins can deal with alot of the incoming AE damage and leave clerics more free to counter the melee dps on whoever is tanking/offtanking. This way there is less of a burden on getting large cleric numbers.</div></div><hr />

Some fights yes, others no. A couple of expamples off the top of my head - Cynosure, Mindrider, Rathe Council, Ikkinz, Ugua, etc. etc. If anything the game is becoming a lot less 10 Clerics healing the MT/MA for the entire raid than ever before.<br />
<br />
Someone dismissed the M'Sha's. Funny, after doing them a few times you realize that all good loot doesn't take 54 players, 10 Clerics, or 5 Warriors. <br />
<br />
IMO, what EQ has become in GoD is intolerant in the hardest cutting-edge guild progression expeditions.<br />
<br />
In some zone you are silly to grab a red add if you aren't seriously up to tanking it - death adds suck.<br />
<br />
I've had a Druid keep me alive as my group's main healer when the incoming damage was severe. But I've also gotten absolutely reamed when a group healer didn't prioritize and for example skip giving the Necro an SL and watch my butt 'cause I'm taking on water or I was a bit slow hitting furious. GoD is unforgiving sometimes. Got to do things &quot;right&quot;.<br />
<br />
The stuff you try and fail at 10 times before suceeding might (although most of these post-PoTime raids are NOT exclusively 1 MT/10 Cleric CH Rotation fights), but then IMO the Primary Tank should be more effective tanking the most brutal battles and the Prime Healer most effective healing him/her.<br />

Battle, I agree with some of what you are saying, but thanks for bringing some arguments up at least :)<br />
<br />
You think the Rathe Council is balanced as far as cleric requirements?<br />
<br />
Out of a raid of 54, most people seem to think that around 10+ clerics is the norm and more is better.  How many clerics do you think should be a good number to have in a raid?  Do you think it is balanced to have 12 clerics and 3 druids present on a raid?<br />
<br />
I very much agree with you that it is NOT unreasonable to require having very well geared players with skill as tanks, and healers with all the proper focus and AA, but I believe that the balance right now is far too heavy with clerics.<br />
<br />
What do the numbers look like for you in your tipical raid?  What do you think they should look like?<br />
<br />
I very much enjoy the tone of this debate, and hope some devs are reading this and taking notes.</div></div><hr />

The stuff you try and fail at 10 times before suceeding might (although most of these post-PoTime raids are NOT exclusively 1 MT/10 Cleric CH Rotation fights), but then IMO the Primary Tank should be more effective tanking the most brutal battles and the Prime Healer most effective healing him/her.<br />
<br />

Mshas are a very nice change from the norm.  Mindrider is just a gay encounter to begin with and its far from high end.  Rathe coucil the first time you needed about 10 clerics to beat it based on how your respective guild cced nonmezzables.  Cynnosure is fairly easy with a low number of clerics but you need dps to counter the arb healing or youll run oom although he is also a nice change from the norm.  Ikkinz you can do most with 6-8 clerics depending, ikk 4 is a pain in the ass but its still doable consistantly.  As for uqua you need 10 clerics there are no questions about it.  If you arnt using 5 per tank on twin you need them for the barxt event.  6 on barxt 4 on construct and di still fires every once in awhile, esp once disc fades on barxt.  Personally i would not include rathe or uqua on that list.  The rest are good examples of not requiring an insane amount of healing, then again qvic isnt instanced so you can scrap them off the list since were basically talking 54 person cap.</div></div><hr />

I'll stick with an earlier responce. Stripped to the basics, EQ is Tanking, Healing, DPS and some utility.<br />
<br />
Depending on how far your guild has progressed, if your current target is for you cutting edge, and to some extent the nature of the raid itself I son't believe 8-15 Healers is unreasonable for a raid nor that if it's cutting edge and features hard hitting boss (or multiple boss) mobs 8-12 Clerics is unreasonable.<br />
<br />
There are difficult raids or portions of raids where crowd control or many add tanks are more important than the 1 MT/10 Cleric model. GoD probably has a higher proportion of these than most previous expansions.<br />
<br />
Still, EQ is not group centric for the most part operating as autonomous units. Nor is it centered around stopping an advancing army of Orcs (Stonemites excepted) where there are no boss mobs to kill. The Vox/Naggy kill the hard boss mob raid is still with us. However, seldom is this the only feature of the raid. There is almost always a multitude of mobs to kill on the way and this is where Paladins, Enchanters, Beastlords, Bards, etc. make their value felt the most.<br />
<br />
Finally, many raids have multiple red mobs that must be tanked and killed simultaniously or AE damage or debilitating buffs that eat mana or endurance or both. These raids get more classes deeply involved.<br />
<br />
Still, in cutting edge most difficult content when you finally reach the boss mob/s pure class specialization will make Clerics and Warriors particularly important. I'd much rather Kill a dragon with a couple dragonet offspring than deal with wave after wave of 10 stonemites.<br />

<br />
You cant tell them sorry you cant play when we dont need you unless theyre bots and warriors arent normally bots in my experience. Every 54 person capped raid starting at uqua you need that many clerics to complete them with a high success rate really, you dont want to swap people out between events that require less clerics.<br />
<br />
Two classes taking 16 raid spots is just wrong.</div></div><hr />

Literacy my friend.  I was talkign about the first time through.  There is no chance in hell of you finishing uqua with 6 or 7 clerics assuming everyone is time geared + ikkinz.  Once you add full qvic armor the event gets 10 times easier.  You need to compare apples with apples, thats like saying emp only takes 2 clerics hes pussy, when he took around 6 + a lot of patching when he was new content.</div></div><hr />

I'm not saying you cant do it with 4, you could easily if you got pretty lucky (All 4 MT's staying up all noq fight for switching after ports etc..)

First off, calm yourself, im not attacking you in any way, so theres no need to get all riled up.  <br />
<br />
Secondly, our first Uqua win we had 8 clerics.  Lots of my guildmates read these boards, feel free to verify with one of them if you so desire.  My only point is, it all depends on your guild.  There is no required number of any class needed to win any event.  <br />
<br />
People who arent in Uqua yet but are thinking about trying it shouldnt think to themselves, &quot;well shit we only have 7 or 8 active clerics, guess we shouldnt give it a go&quot;.  It all depends on your guild /shrug.</div></div><hr />

It really depends on additional healing if you have a lot of druids and shaman.  Personally tanking barxt with 13k 2900 and a pause 6 rot di fired about 4ish times.  Has 4 clerics on constructs tank and he died at 10%ish.  The point is these encounters are very healing intensive.  8 clerics i could see if you have a shitload of druids and shaman to patch on construct, 6 is a bit shady unless again you have 6-8 druids.</div></div><hr />

Don't have enough clerics to fill out your chain healing circles? You're screwed sir. Ever give wonder to why there's more cleric bots then any others I've seen out there, it's not because they're a fun class to play that isn't required. Healing chains forever screwed the pooch in terms of raid class %'s, and untill the very recent past has SoE changed from the &quot;MORE DPS IS ONLY WAY TO MAKE MOBS HARDER&quot; mentality.

Yuck, gearing up 6 Tanks is the sux.  In a strictly DKP guild that doesn't target a specific character for upgrades, this leaves all the plate classes fighting for gear.<br />

However druids and shm are at serious disadvantage healing compared to a cleric.  This game is still clearly built around clerics healing defensive warriors on boss mobs.<br />
<br />
Thats what I meant.  I also agree 100%, the game is built far too much around Cleric healing power and it gets worse every expansion, mob power goes up more than player power requiring more healing out of the raid.  heres some quick numbers:<br />
<br />
Time 72 people 8 clerics (11.11%)<br />
LDoN 36 people 6 clerics (16.67%)<br />
Tacvi 54 people 10 clerics if you want to minimize relying on luck (18.52%)<br />
<br />
It keeps going up...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mishratm</div><div class="date">08-25-2004, 08:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's an EQ pendulum I swear it. It started off sorta central with Velious. Then it went completely to the right with luclin and we got low dps, high AC enormous hp mobs. Then we complained it was boring, so pendulum starts swinging back to the left, and just past the centre heading up, we got PoP. High  dps, moderate hp. It was pretty fun except for the flagging to get into certain zones. Then, we get GoD. Which (without Omens to compare it too) appears to have Extreme dps, low hp mobs. I'd  say we're almost  at the top left of the pendulum swing, and the developers need to bring it somewhere back to the middle for the survivability of the game. <br />
<br />
I've see druids compliaining that they don't want more healing power, as they don't want to end up chain healing an MT / OT just to keep the raid alive. CH rots are possibly the most boring thing in the game &quot;Oh look, there's my name. I'll just push this button and wait 12 seconds&quot;, so I don't really blame them. Chain healing quick heals is very similiar.<br />
<br />
Whilst I certainly don't want the status quo of the game to change re: Warriors being the main raid tank, any shortage of clerics in GoD - style expansions will cripple a guild into near non-existence. Not enough clerics , no raids. No raids, members leave. Guild dies, people quit.</div></div><hr />

I agree totally with Mishra.  The top cause of raids death at least that I have experienced is cleric turnout.  I fully believe in classes being required.<br />
<br />
For example, I believe that the toughest bosses SHOULD require a warrior to tank, the difference is, warrior requirement on raids tend to be a lot more reasonable.  For a guild just starting in the elementals, 2 warriors on a raid is plenty, more is good, but two is more than enough to have a very good chance of winning, but I don't see anyone new to fire winning any miniboss with two clerics.<br />
<br />
My opinion of class balance is that there is nothing wrong with REQUIRING a few key classes in low numbers, but that you should not require abnormal numbers to progress.<br />
<br />
I am going to cut &amp; paste this thread on a few boards with high visibility to get some feedback from everyone, it is far too late to do anything about it for the current content, but hopefully we can stop OoW from requiring 15 clerics per raid.</div></div><hr />

15 clerics in a 54 man instanced raid !  As you see 75% of the guilds in eq fall apart.</div></div><hr />

Happening all over already especially with bored clerics doing beta for EQ2 and WoW along iwth other games in general. SoE won't make em more fun to play they just keep bending us over saying tough that is the way it is, well when all these clerics eventually get tired of it SoE is going to get bent over.<br />
<br />
I suspect they already are to some degree but we'll see. They are prolly to daft to understand why guilds are falling apart. I would wager 75% of guilds plus fail because of the right classes to beat content and I can't imagine another class other than clerics that has as much responsiblity or needed redundency on raids.</div></div><hr />

Using my own guild as an example, at various points we've had recruitment closed to every single class in the game except 1... Clerics.  For a long time our requirements for most classes was 65, 200+ AAs, decent gear, full time flags.  Our cleric requirement was 65, no gear, no AAs, no flags, just show up.</div></div><hr />

Requirements for Paladin/SK - 350+aa, decent gear, must be very good at what you do, have every flag the rest of the guild has.<br />
Requirements for everyone but bards/clerics - able to do your job decently, have some aa's, be flagged up to time and kod<br />
Requirements for clerics/bards-  Know how to spell your name, know how to use /rt, know how to heal a mt. helps to: know how to assist heal (bards was: be a better bard than the guy boxing a cleric + paladin at the same time)<br />
<br />
<br />
Its amazing how many bad clerics get guilded, simply because you need so many of them, and the class as a whole sucks so hard to play for too long.  Between the end of Luclin and PoP, we turned over 19 clerics.  Was to the point where we were relying on people boxing clerics, and myself boxing ramp tank + bard + cleric at once...<br />
