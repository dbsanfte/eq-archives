The trick as an enchanter is to realize which mobs will need to be mezzed next, and which mob will die before your current mez wears off.  The fight is a blast.  The adds can con anywhere from blue to yellow, so use bliss, ummm....unslowable as well.  I don't remember whether they despawn or not after you kill the named.  Leaning towards no.

<br />
Can anyone confirm that Decimator and Slaughterer actually drop loot at all?  Atm I have a very limited pool of guildies that are geared/skilled well enough for Ikkinz1, and thats just farming the nonDD named.  The 8 hour Lockout Time makes more than one run a day almost impossible, and its not always possible to get even one run a day done.  As such we're willing to spend the extra time when we DO get a group together killing the other two named, assuming they at least have a chance of dropping loot.  As I post this we're medding for another Slaughterer kill, so mabye I'll answer my own question.  /crosses fingers<br />
<br />
EDIT: Slaughterer down, second time no loot.</div></div><hr />

Name of the earring?  If its caster usable might appease my casters some, since PA drops 2x melee loot and only 1 caster loot.</div></div><hr />

its melee only name escapes me 130hp also drops off kodtaz rares. All the trials have predominately melee loot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, even if they don't always drop loot, can they drop spells? We still need a lot of the dropped spells and hanging out in Ikkinz for them seems more appealing to me than mindlessly farming KT.</div></div><hr />

Same difficulty, just not worth the time to clear the mobs near them and then kill them.  The best way to farm stones and spells is off the minis in Kod'Taz.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can't farm the instances since you'll get a lockout timer when you kill the first PA, so you can't just leave the instance and go grab another one and repeat it again.  Then it's not worth another 1-2 hours to clear trash to get at the others.</div></div><hr />

You do realize the same mobs are up every time you create an instance.  This isn't like an LDoN instance where a random name can spawn.  Singular might, twin struggles, tri fates will have the same mobs up each time, same location - the only random will be what the first name drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">04-24-2004, 03:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not entirely Derrict.

A couple times doing this we have had two up even.All I have ever seen off them is the 35 mana Aug though.<br />

Also there is a pretty decent Mask that drops that has a Poison based Dot Focus iirc,But it drops randomly off trash and is rather rare,I have only ever seen one in about 9 trips in the zone.</div></div><hr />

Does the lockout time affect you if you dont kill anything?  Can you just keep getting instances until you get one with a PA?   Or have trackers/rogues/invun types get their own instance and whichever has a PA wins?</div></div><hr />

I've only done one since the patch (trial 2) and the Rav Interceptor was up as soon as we zoned in.

I thought maybe it just wouldn't let me spawn 'regular' trials anymore since they'd been beaten/other progression quests done also, so i made my cleric leader and had him get us a trial #2 while lockout timer was running on 3, and named was up.<br />
<br />
Glad to read some clarification on this, as other people i know without beating all 3 have spawned nameds each time. Guess i just have bad luck hehe.<br />
<br />
Additionally, as stated above, ALL mobs in trials are now noticeably easier by a good deal. Named themselves were gimped down pretty hardcore, almost comparable to some of the field nameds in kod'taz.<br />
<br />
Oh, and trials also now have literally less than half the mobs in them as they did before. Which saves on clearing time i guess, but pretty weak.<br />

Wish they'd stop ruining challenges.</div></div><hr />

Bosses are slowable now, but some changes, don't use defensive on the DD, but she slows, probably done to allow Pallys/SK's to tank her with greater ease, still rough if not using a fully time or higher war, otherwise it's probably a joke<br />
<br />
Not sure if this always happened, but 1 priest in Ikkinz 2 will summon you from outside the room if you; wipe, come back and the snake repops in between, summoned tank and then me from far outside with 0 agro on any mobs (yes we had zoned). <br />
<br />
To anyone who has done the old versions these will be pretty easy, for newer people they will still present a challenge,we had all but killed the DD in it's previous state and took us 3 tries to get just the DD dead this time.... now we gotta think of a way to kill them priests =/</div></div><hr />

Using any defensive disc causes her to attack (sorta like rampage) on a random member of your group, something to the effect of;<br />

<br />
Orionsun was the chanter not tank here, but was definatly triggered by a defensive disc from the monk or war. I wasn't in the trial myself so couldn't say which for 100%.<br />
<br />
It appears they've changed the trial to be more focused on the boss, not the trial clearing, but it certainly is not as hard as Ikkinz pre patch, but the easy Ahnilator loot is gone unless you get lucky :(</div></div><hr />

I know in Tipt i transition from furious to evasive and dont see a message, or lose aggro..<br />
But i've never checked logs or seen any message to indicate he does through spam.</div></div><hr />

Kinda slipping off topic but I've noted the same thing.  On two occasions used furious then defensive and got the spam but he stayed on me.  I figured it was a hate reduction to disc person but might not cause problems in every case.  If its random on groupmember then I got lucky twice.</div></div><hr />
