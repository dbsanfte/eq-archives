<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey I just wanted to start a general thread about GoD, what is some of the stuff we BoT/Ldon junkys can hit? didnt put this is the zones area because I'd like to keep it light so i can be &quot;surprised&quot;<br />
<br />
Ive decided to drag some guildies to their deaths and what not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Try Barindu.  There are quite a few random named in the courtyard area that are pretty mean but doable (hit for 1100ish, at least partially slowable) and drop some pretty decent stuff.  The Ferubi zone is probably the safest place to pull but I haven't spent a lot of time there.  Be sure you have the latest maps from eqtoolbox, there are some really good GoD maps there.<br />
<br />
If Barindu is too easy, give ferubi a shot but don't expect to get any named unless you have at least a couple hours to clear to them.  Of course there are some very good random drops there, on par with Ssra loot.  If the Barindu courtyard is too hard, the hallways near the quinimi zone are easier or you can try Quinimi.  Riwii should be similar to Barindu for difficulty, but I haven't spent any time there. <br />
<br />
Anyway, I'm pretty much a GoD newbie myself, but that should give you a couple things to try.  Let us know how it goes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Daabu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Riwwi colleseum is great exp/loot for a lower level group.<br />
Then I'd say Qinimi, then Ferubi, then Barindu.  I could be off, but that's the order i'd suggest.<br />
<br />
You could also try the sewers, they're probably easier than Barindu mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Barindu harder than Ferubi?  I don't think so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Riwwi is soloable by necros and rangers, so it should be group bait.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mukaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">In Qinimi there is a named ukun that spawns in the center cage and if you clear the roamers in the area around the cages there are couple of names that can spawn on their path.<br />
<br />
I haven't spent any time in zones past Qinimi yet due to time constraints but hope to check out Riwwi soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Check out the gauntlets in my magelo for one of the random drops you can find in Qinimi. We got this pair off the dog-mobs in the kennels. I suspect the item drops randomly throughout the zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Have a mab of GoD? or a zone connection guide? These shitty names have me confused(would like a link to the EQtoolbox maps)</div></div><hr />

Keep running past the Stone steps and edifice that is the entrance to Quinimi, in the corner as you keep running is a stone that is the zone in to KT</div></div><hr />

<br />
In-game maps can be downloaded at http://www.mapfiend.net/  Easiest thing to do is follow the &quot;download all maps&quot; link in the upper right, but if you have maps you have personally edited and want to keep you have to be careful not to overwrite them.</div></div><hr />

You get to Kod`Taz through a stone in Natimbi.  The zone is locked until you have completed all 4 sewers trials and the two mountain trials, or killed Smith Rondo instead of the 4 sewers trials.  I did some slight editting of your ascii map.  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Look up the mantle of ferociousness.  Also there is a range item (Totem) I've seen drop with mana presIV and 100HP/mana<br />
<br />
You could possibly do the mini nameds as well.  Drop 25hp/end augs and 15AC augs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Galdaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">You can check my magelo to see the mentle of ferociousness.  Two dropped for us on a crawl last night.  Figures I just auged my horn spiked shoulder plates.  Now if they will add the ability to remove an aug sooner than later. :D</div></div><hr />
