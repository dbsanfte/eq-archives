<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarcazzm</div><div class="date">11-19-2004, 01:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was 55 when i got my Skyshrine bp, and i love it. I've used the hell out of it and its getting to the point that its just not good enough AC/HP anymore, in spite of being my highest AC item heh. I'm wondering what you guys think i should do.<br />
<br />
My guild isnt doing much raiding lately so most raid content (ie ornates+) are out of the question.<br />
<br />
Is it worth grinding  nro dungeons and  getting a royal attendant bp?<br />
Whats the best i can do with it for hps? as far as easy to attain or buyable hp augs? ive seen them taken to 170hp, is that about the limit of its potential?<br />
<br />
Should i try to farm 150k for a Dragorn Heirloom BP? thats about the going rate on the tribunal atm. I had looked at magnetic stuff but the charged stuff is 225k+ and the uncharged version is only 4ac/10hp more than my current bp. I could easily augment the dragorn bp to 150hp though with LDoN<br />
<br />
any suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tohkin</div><div class="date">11-19-2004, 02:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">BP is always a shitty slot to upgrade. I'm still wearing Kizrak's and there aren't many upgrades available to me. <br />
<br />
If you guys have anyone Seru keyed, he's pretty easy these days and drops a nice BP. Otherise Dragorn Heirloom or Charged Magnetic will be your best bets, as spendy as they may be. <br />
<br />
I'm not too certain how difficult the RCoD instances are, but I've heard the BP is a fairly common drop in the sewer instance, so you could always try to camp it.<br />
<br />
The Royal Attendent BP isn't a bad option if you can't afford/camp the DH/CM BP's, but it's a major time sink especially if you are planning to aug with 40hp (I'm assuming you are).<br />
<br />
Like I said BP is a real tough slot to upgrade so don't feel bad about having a weaker BP slot and spending your time/money on bigger upgrades in different slots.</div></div><hr />

<br />
id love to kill seru but i dont even thing i could with my guild. i took a week off and came back, half my casters were gone to EQ2 or WoW beta.  i have the seru bp in my goals magelo but honestly its probably still out of my reach, though i'd love to get my hands on one.<br />
<br />
what kind of force do you kill Seru with? i'm a little disheartened with the inactivity in my guild atm, but i'm no where near requirements for any raiding guilds on trib, so the best i'll be able to get is baz gear unless i can get a pickup raid willing to let me loot a bp if one drops heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elfried</div><div class="date">11-19-2004, 04:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You have some other slots that are much easier and cheaper to upgrade then your BP.<br />
<br />
examples:<br />
Finger: Steel Ring of earthen resilience<br />
Ear: Fiercely hooked claw, Tear of the rainmaker, etc<br />
Range: Elemental bow ( i use stonewood) gives you +5AC, +45HP !!<br />
Waist: Heavy Rubicite Girdle (tribute haste is cheap and more haste then you currently have +11AC, +20HP)<br />
<br />
I would upgrade first what gives the most bang for the buck. If you want to upgrade your Breastplate it will definately be very expensive. Livestone and Farwater Breastplate would be other options here.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I did it with about 11 ppl (no bane weapons), took awhile but worked fine.  <br />
<br />
I don't mean to cause offense, but if you think you can't do something, and don't try, it'll become further and further out of your reach, whereas if you keep pushing to raid something -- anything -- you'll gradually get into some sort of groove.  Even if you just have a few folks on, cobble something together and just go do it.  IMO if you just let ppl xp day after day or play alts, even casual-type raiders will lose their spark and move on, or quit.  If ppl logon and see ppl making an active attempt to go raid something, it really can boost morale.<br />
<br />
That being said, I've done Seru with about 10 ppl.  Been awhile but it was something like 3 clerics, chanter, shaman, mage, bard, paladin, druid, warrior.  Bard helped a lot because he provided a large part of the DS which was our main DPS hehe.<br />
<br />
Other options for ya might be Ornate (clicky!) and there's one that drops in RSS I think?  Celestial Lorica or something.<br />
<br />
Good luck.<br />
<br />
edit: Agree with the post above.  <br />
<br />
Consider camping Ring of Slime event in Cazic Thule, this should be easily 1 groupable by now.  The encounter can drop Crystallized Acid Bracer - the 100 hp war-only bracer.<br />
<br />
You can group in WoS for the neck upgrade (Blue Flame something?) I've seen it drop a few times now.  Alternatively, do Ruj hard LDoN for the 90 hp neck.<br />
<br />
A ring upgrade drops in WoS off nameds.  IIRC it's slightly better than the earth Steel ring.<br />
<br />
Range slot with 105 hp drops in WoS off nameds, it has FT1 though so casters might bitch a bit if you roll.<br />
<br />
Too tired to think of more but good luck.</div></div><hr />

He's pretty easily one groupable, there are some good threads in the past about strats and stuff from when I was asking about it.<br />
<br />
I hear seru is easy enough to 1 group too, although I haven't had the time to go get an arx key and try it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Although I wouldn't turn in my Ornate BP after I'm done with it, even if I could.  The 300hp/XXac is indispensible when you don't have a shaman/bst.  I know people that already have a better BP that bought it just for the click.</div></div><hr />
