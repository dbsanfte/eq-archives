<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaneis</div><div class="date">12-03-2004, 12:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok I've read several different things concerning mods, augs and stacking. <br />
The main one I'm looking at is dodge.<br />
<br />
I have a drape of the agile (8% dodge).  I know it stacks with the Improved Dodge augments.<br />
<br />
My question is this:  Do the Improved Dodge modifications stack???<br />
For example, if I get ID 1, 2 and 3, will they all stack?<br />
<br />
I know for a fact that two of the same, i.e. ID 3, won't stack.   But what about the differing augs?  Has anyone parsed this and come up with anything?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">12-03-2004, 01:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If i remember well mods that work like focus (Dodge / Parry / Cleave / Ferocity / EoA) dont stack.<br />
<br />
I'm almost sure it was a dev that posted about EoA when Qvic gloves were discovered.<br />
<br />
As for +% mods (dodge riposte) i dont think their impact is noticable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">12-03-2004, 02:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Echo of Anger mods don't stack, unfortunately. =P  The highest percentage takes effect just like haste works.  Problem is, I don't think there's an Echo of Anger upgrade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">12-03-2004, 02:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Only highest mod takes effect.  No melee combat effect is noticeable without parsing, same way as AAs.  If someone tells you this or that effect makes a noticeable difference it's just wishful thinking.  In the end every melee effect adds about the same as any other effect of similar category.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">12-03-2004, 04:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I aggree except for cleave effect. Lucy sjows it has a different way of increasing critical strike than just miltiplying it by a % (ala dodge/parry). Moreover a cleave effect can give the crit ability to a non criting class. And this is the most important difference.<br />
I suspect cleave to add a fixed % rather than multiplying the current one. it can be verified with a parse on the impact of cleave3 on a war and on a wiz. And if this is correct then cleave effect can possibly stack if there is no staking rule that allows cleave to stack with disc and AA but not with each other.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">12-03-2004, 08:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If Crit does stack then combining multiple Cleave V items with Savage Onslaught could potentially get too powerful.  It's possible that Cleave is an exception, but I'd be skeptical.<br />
<br />
I'd assume if you give Ferocity mods to a class that normally can't double attack they can double attack too, and that's assumed to not stack.  Or has anyone actually tested that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cily</div><div class="date">12-05-2004, 03:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, Ferocity adds a percentage to your ability, where cleave adds some &quot;other&quot; modifier that I do not understand.<br />
<br />
So it is not a safe assumption at all that thet function the same.<br />
<br />
I am a bit confused as to why cleave effects are listed oin like 11 slots tho, and the crit+ from saliks is only slot 6.  /shrug<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">12-06-2004, 03:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guess is if cleave stacks with each other, then they might only stack with another one that have a different power (ala first FT stacking rule). I mean, with a miltiplication of cleave aug, it can become easy to have multiple cleave effect on us; thus it would be to overpowerfull to let cleave stack with each other. However they let cleaveX stacks with cleaveY (if X is different than Y) then it decrease the overpowering possibility.<br />
Ex : for now the best cleave set up is :<br />
1. if there is no stacking possibility : Golem Stone Face Guard (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=47301) total : cleave 5.<br />
2. if there is no stacking rule : Golem Stone Face Guard (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=47301) + Sapphire Choker of Adaptation (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=47226) + 3x Radiant Kyanite of Pure Sundering (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=47301) + 4x Radiant Sodalite of Pure Sundering (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=74772) + 5x Radiant Stormflow of Pure Sundering (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=74754) + Radiant Titanite of Pure Sundering (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=72472) + Gem-Studded Band of Struggle (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=69061) + Vadd's Chestplate of Elite Combat (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68960) + Red Crystal Ring (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=70621) + Bracer of the Heartstriker (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68603) + Hoop of Scales (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=69447) =&gt; total = cleave 57 !!!<br />
3. there is a stacking rule that allows cleave to stack with another one of a different power :<br />
Golem Stone Face Guard (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=47301) + Sapphire Choker of Adaptation (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=47226) + Radiant Kyanite of Pure Sundering (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=47301) + Vadd's Chestplate of Elite Combat (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68960) + Bracer of the Heartstriker (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68603) =&gt; Total = cleave 15<br />
<br />
since the maximum is cleave 500 (see mighty strike for 100% crit rate), cleave 1,2,3,4, or 5 are to weak to be a way to chose items, and since all GoD melee armors have cleave 2 (which is subpar of what is attainable), I think the third point in my exemple may be true (I hope so at least) because, even if cleave 15 is impressive, it become noticeable (+3% crit rate).<br />
however there is still another possibility (which is very likely to be when we think at SoE history). The cleave effect may either stacks without any restriction (ala exemple #2) but with a cap on crit rate from items (ala FT).<br />
<br />
well that a very expensive, both in time and pp, theory to parse for validation. Thus I bet we will never know the answer, or at least not before the cleave aug are much used by every melee-dps classes and that poeple starts to think about it really hard.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">12-07-2004, 04:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the post on the safehouse is made by a developer of this game that actually work with the code that explicitly say it doesn't stack. that's why his few words have a bigger impact that hundred's of mine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sear</div><div class="date">12-08-2004, 04:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would second Yoda's thoughts.  Unlike the (dis)information ministers, you can almost take what a programmer says as gospel.  I say almost because mistakes do happen and bugs still creep up.  They are not infallable, but if Kavhok says &quot;it works this way&quot; then by golly that is how it is supposed to work.  If it isn't working &quot;this way&quot; then /bug it and it will be fixed.<br />
