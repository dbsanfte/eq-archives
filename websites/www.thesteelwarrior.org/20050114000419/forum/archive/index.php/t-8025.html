<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rushing</div><div class="date">07-13-2004, 08:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is my problem. I have almost a full set of Oger CT cultural armor and i just hit 55. Now i have been looking at some of the ornate stuff and the stats seem to be minimal improvements at best. Is it worth it to spend large amounts of pp say 50k+ or so on small upgrades?   If ornate isn't the answer then what should i be looking for in possable upgrades? <br />

I've been considering the thought of upgrades past cultural, at best I'll probably consider a few select peices or ornate and use the elemental crafted armor to get my by a bit longer. Its expensive, but at least you can sel the element stuff after your done with it.<br />
<br />
After that I'll probably work on questing/killing for non-visable in SoV. check out some of the cheaper bazaar upgrades for the shoulders and boots in particular. Horn spiked pauldrons or something like that and boots of bloodied dark rights? you could do the loyalist shield quest for your back. However, you are doing damn good so far, I wouldn't worry about it too much until you get to 65.</div></div><hr />

--Helm of Rallos Zek<br />
--Horn Spiked Shoulder Pads<br />
--Dried Clay Armguards<br />
--Mana-threaded Bone Bracelet<br />
--Crimson Boots of the Director or Bloodied Boots of Dark Rights<br />
--Warlords Steel Gauntlets<br />
--Farwater smithed armor<br />
<br />
Ornate BP and legs are also pretty nice, but don't spend too much on them.</div></div><hr />

Tak LDON armor is slightly better than Farwater overall, but you'll be earning points slowly until you get near 65, so that's not a short term solution.<br />
<br />
There is a full suit of plate armor spread amongst the front 10 GoD zones on single-group encounters.  This armor is about as good as the LDON suit overall, some pieces are better and some are slightly worse.  This is the best non-raid loot armor that you can obtain at this time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've spent precisely 2 nights in GoD (most of my guildmates didn't buy it), but I'd like to go back soon. The one GoD drop I got in that time made me salivate.</div></div><hr />

How difficult are these camps generally?  I've been asked a few times if I can tank these camps but am unsure what to answer.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pumilio</div><div class="date">07-13-2004, 10:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">man hard ldon is better for loot then most the unflagged god zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mokor Leadheaad</div><div class="date">07-13-2004, 11:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">not realy about equal 80+hp around same ac. the free augs are what make it good though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">07-14-2004, 03:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nagzrub, I'd compare them with Hard LDON Assassinate missions for the most part, except for Jhiru in Tipt who is a cut above the rest.<br />
<br />
Mokor's &quot;Gates pre-Kodtaz&quot; profile is a good reference.  It's more of an ideal GoD gear setup.  Many of the slots have lesser items available too, so there is a progression path.<br />
<br />
Mokor, you can add to your profile the Mantle of Ferociousness (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=26115) from random Ferubi trash.  Is there no plate helmet pre-Kod'Taz?  I thought I'd seen one mentioned before.</div></div><hr />
