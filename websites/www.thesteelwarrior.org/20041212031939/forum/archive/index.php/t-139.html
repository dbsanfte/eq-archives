<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">04-20-2003, 01:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you're really that confused, I recommend checking the various magelos of 60+ tanks on this board.  The points we have spent should tell you what you need to know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">04-20-2003, 06:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I value each general AA skill as worth one point. Except the New Tanaan Crafting Mastery thing.<br />
<br />
I value each Archetype AA skill as being worth 2, 4 or 6 points.<br />
<br />
It gets trickier from there.<br />
<br />
I usually just click &quot;V&quot; on my keyboard and let my computer tell me how much each point is worth.<br />
<br />
Of course your post wasn't asking that was it? You were looking for guidance in regards to which AAs warriors get before others? As in which path to take?<br />
<br />
In that regards I say it's up to you. And it really is dependant on your own character, your time and your situation.<br />
<br />
A level 60 tank in a guild that's not doing anything in PoP and that already has 3 tanks ahead of him or her is going to have different AA needs than a level 65 tank running around trying to get into the plane of time. And of course a level 51 warrior who just wants to grind some AAs cause he or she now CAN and wants to play with the neat new feature is going to have different needs than all of them.<br />
<br />
As a general rule of thumb ... for warriors ... Run 3 is important. Any AA that adds more hit points is useful (Natural Durability, Physical Enhancement, Planar Durability, even increased natural stamina for the little races who felt they got slighted at character creation with low STA). Area Taunt is very popular because of how useful it is to the raiding warrior, and the warrior in an XP group.<br />
<br />
Lightning Reflexes is a very popular AA for warriors who want to increase their avoidance in both XP groups and at raids.<br />
<br />
Offensive AAs like Punishing Blade and Ferocity are popular.<br />
<br />
But you know, no one's going to yell at you if you secretly want to buy Rampage just to see the spam, my GOD the spam!<br />
<br />
It's YOUR AA path. Tailor it to YOUR needs. If that's increased natural metabolism and Flurry 3, go for it.</div></div><hr />

Most warriors tend to go for the aa's that add hps, then avoidance then mitigation then go to the offensive ones.<br />
<br />
But for the amount of aa points it takes to max all of those everyone tends to spend at least a few points where they probably shouldnt just for something different to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Roma</div><div class="date">04-20-2003, 07:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First of all, you have to decide where your skills are best put... some people go all defensive, some go all offensive AAs, some try to split the mix. Personally I am going to go all defesive to so I will be a better tank for my guild :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
... because hitting a mob for 32013 will put a smile on your face.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kellaen</div><div class="date">04-21-2003, 08:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've always finished the defensive aa's before touching any offense, cept with PoP I had aa's saved and bought PP5 and TM3 as I leveled to 65.<br />
<br />
Depending on what you do most influences the path. I tank in xp and raids, thus defensive &gt; offensive in priority for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Galdaen</div><div class="date">04-22-2003, 10:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As mentioned, most of us work on our defensive AAs first...at least that is my plan.  Run3 should be the first thing any class goes for.  Your next 3 in the general skills is up to you.  Some like regen, some like metabolism, some like stamina, etc.  Whatever you think suits you best.<br />
<br />
Next, everyone eventually gets up to ND3 for the hit points.  Combat stability and combat agility are the next two most common along the defensive tank line.  Some mix and match as they go rather than maxing ND first, others max ND first.<br />
<br />
Many people swear by AE Taunt on the next level of AA skills.  I can think of many times that it would have saved my groups cleric or chanter when normal taunt wasn't getting the job done, but I do see some going with other skills.  PE in this level of AAs is also a good choice as it improves all three of your ND, CS, and CA.<br />
<br />
I haven't even considered the planar abilities yet, but lightning replexes and planar durability seem to be the most common in that line.<br />
<br />
My plan of attack:<br />
<br />
Run3<br />
Stamina 3 ( messed up and hit str in a rush once so got stamina 2 and strength 1 *sigh*)<br />
ND1, ND2, ND3<br />
AE Taunt<br />
CS1<br />
CA1<br />
PE<br />
CS2<br />
CA2<br />
CS3<br />
CA3<br />
<br />
Then I will decide later from there.  This is my chosen path for a defensive tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wulfran</div><div class="date">04-22-2003, 11:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As mentioned previously, you have to decide, based on your role and playstyle. Do you exp all the time or do you raid? Are you an MT or down the list a bit?<br />
<br />
A lot go to the defensive AAs first, but some people like the DPS increasing ones as well: just depends on how you play.<br />
<br />
The one thing I will add though is that for Class Abilities NOTHING touches AE Taunt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grimmlokk</div><div class="date">04-22-2003, 01:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ideally for defensive stuff I *think* this would be the preferred route, starting at arch...<br />
<br />
ND1-2-3<br />
CA1<br />
CS1<br />
PE<br />
PD1-2-3<br />
CA2-3<br />
LR1-2-3-4-5<br />
CS2-3<br />
ID1-2-3-4-5<br />
<br />
<br />
 But that's just me and what I'd do if I was just starting to work on AA's. Place HP stuff before straight defensive stuff because it helps 100% of the time. Even when not tanking(AE's).<br />
<br />
 If you did not care a lick about defense and wanted to pretend yer a monk I'd say this way, and get a 2H first thing.<br />
<br />
CF1-2-3<br />
PB1-2-3<br />
Fer1-2-3<br />
Flur1-2-3<br />
Rag Flur1-2-3<br />
FotA1-2-3<br />
<br />
 But don't take my word for it. 105aa's spent and only 8 on offensive stuff. Ferocity 1, and (blech)Rampage, stupid AE groups...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Roma</div><div class="date">04-22-2003, 04:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know its been hashed over before, but someone mentioned it here... I fully believe that Regen3 &gt; Sta3. Over time you will regen way more than the 20 or so hp that Sta3 provides. Most mobs hit for more than that 20 points of dmg anyways, just seems more bang for your buck to be able to regen at a faster rate when you get ambushed by stupidgreenmob01, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dinian</div><div class="date">04-22-2003, 04:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In general defensive AAs will far better suit your group and raids far more than offensive AAs in my opinion.<br />
<br />
That said, here's my advice for up and coming warriors:<br />
<br />
Runspeed 3<br />
(any other general, probably regen) x 3<br />
ND1, CA1, CS1<br />
ND3<br />
CA3<br />
CS3<br />
Area Taunt<br />
Physical Enhancement<br />
<br />
Any order on these:<br />
Lightning Reflexes 5<br />
Innate Defenses 5<br />
Planar Durability 3<br />
Planar Power 5<br />
Punishing Blade 3 or Ambidexterity (or both)<br />
Stalwart Endurance 3<br />
Combat Fury 3<br />
Ferocity 3<br />
Flurry 3<br />
Raging Flurry 3<br />
Fury of the Ages</div></div><hr />
