<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarcazzm</div><div class="date">02-20-2005, 01:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm sick to f*cking death of this. When i  zone to broodlands, I crash back to server select screen (no &quot;You have been disconnected&quot; message, just crashes) and after the 1018 has expired when i log back in, i get to the character select screen, and then the same thing happens when i try to log back in on that toon. It happens to both my accounts, no matter what toon i zone.<br />
<br />
I have done all the little bullshit steps the worthless support team gave me, including advanced file check, deleting and redownloading *ALL* the broodlands zone files (yes even the mp3 and char models).<br />
<br />
my datarate is set to 8.0<br />
<br />
i am clueless and last time this happened it was draniks scar when i bought oow, exact same symptoms, which eventually (a month or so after oow was released) started working on its own.<br />
<br />
the GM's in the stuckcharacter channel know both my toons names and server by heart, i see them at least a dozen times a night trying to zone. <br />
<br />
i have called my isp and asked them to reroute my connection and they claim to have done this and the issue has not changed.<br />
<br />
does anyone have ANY ideas? im about to delete my toons and send soe a mailbomb. (not really but i WILL delete and quit if this shit doesnt get fixed)<br />
<br />
IM SICK OF PAYING OUT for FRIGGIN CONTENT AND GETTIN JACK SHIT.<br />
<br />
/rant off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Teeo</div><div class="date">02-21-2005, 12:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would ask a close mate you trust and get him to log on to your account from his PC and get your Toon out.<br />
<br />
My silly Necro friend managed to zone into Broodlands without the expansion only to crash to his desktop real quick and was then unable to get back in to get him. Hence I got him out from my PC. <br />
<br />
There is such a mix up with not having the correct patcher because even with the expansion paid for if you have not got the disks and only a serial key then patcher 1.1.8 does not allow you to download the expansion files (No DoN option in the advanced) so it is a matter of downloading the Universal Patcher 1.0.38.<br />
<br />
Suspect none of this will help you that is the nature of EQ lol but it may.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarcazzm</div><div class="date">02-24-2005, 01:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">my patcher has a DoN checkbox and it downloads the files fine. I own the expansion so they can quite frankly kiss my ass and reset me, they owe me content, i shouldnt have to have someone move my char and it pisses me off.<br />
<br />
anyhow thanks for the reply, i guess im the only one in the world with this problem now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arny</div><div class="date">02-24-2005, 04:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Firewall ? I ask because I had a similar problem with characters randomly going LD, especially upon zoning.<br />
<br />
The fix (for me) turned out to be resetting the eqgame.exe and everquest.exe as allowed applications in the firewall, sometimes more than once, before it would work properly. I even have to do this with the firewall disabled or I still get ld's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Venkmen</div><div class="date">02-24-2005, 07:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Have you checked all of your drivers and stuff.  <br />
<br />
Make sure that they are all up to date and what not.  I have seen some weird and random problems in my time in EQ that all boiled down to driver or hardware issues.<br />
<br />
Just a thought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khemo</div><div class="date">02-24-2005, 10:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I remember quite a while ago having a similar problem ... my character would walk into a zone and cause my EQ session to immediately crash to server select.  Would not allow me to log back on that same character either (but could log on alts at character select).<br />
<br />
Was able to get the character out of a problem zone like that by using a second computer with EQ installed.  Didn't make sense to me at the time (and still doesn't).  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">czai</div><div class="date">02-25-2005, 07:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had  a problem like this a long, long time ago.  What I did was delete and then repatch every single file that was in the expansion I was having problems with, and then it worked.  Took a long time though.  Good luck :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dima</div><div class="date">02-25-2005, 07:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had this exact problem when my drive went defective in beta, I would always go LD while zoning. Does zoning take abnormally long?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarcazzm</div><div class="date">02-25-2005, 03:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">no, other zones load in a flash (15 seconds or less usually) and broodlands does not produce a loading bar or anything it just crashes. i have once againd tried all these suggestions with no luck whatsoever.<br />
<br />
keep them coming please guys</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarcazzm</div><div class="date">02-28-2005, 11:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">its still not working after re formatting and reinstalling windows etc. even tried a new hard drive but no change. i am convinced that SoE is cutting bandwidth or some shit like this. anyone please have any other suggestions??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Venkmen</div><div class="date">03-01-2005, 12:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a guildie that is having this problem, but not all of the time.  My best guess since you reformatted and reinstalled is that it is some sort of weird conflict with something in your system.  Whether it is a pice of hardware, or a program in your system that is being funky with the current version of EQ.  <br />
<br />
I know that this sucks, but I would not get real bent out of shape until after the next patch.  I had an issue about 2 years ago where I could not connect to EQ for almost a month because of something that was done in a patch that did not jive with something in my system.  Neither I, any of my friends, or SoE technical support could figure out exactly what it was, but once EQ was patched the next time it worked just fine.<br />
<br />
I hate to hear that you are still having problems bud, but keep hope.  It might work soon.<br />
<br />
<br />
On a side note.  There could be an issue with your video card.  What type of card is it, and how old is it.  If your card is starting to go bad, it could be something in the zone that your card is having a hard time rendering.  This could cause your system to freak out.  Just tossing out any ideas I can think of or have seen in all my years playing games.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarcazzm</div><div class="date">03-01-2005, 12:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;Neither I, any of my friends, or SoE technical support could figure out exactly what it was, but once EQ was patched the next time it worked just fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
so they can fix the bug but they have no idea what it is? sorry thats just not consistent. How can they possibly address an issue when they have no idea whats causing it?<br />
<br />
No, they know what the hell is wrong and they just do not care. why do you think there's a stuckcharacter room since the release of OoW? people have been having this issue and they can reset characters faster than fixing the problem.<br />
<br />
My video card is a geforce4 ti-4200 128mb with 2 (two) cooling fans, runs extremely cool and is in pristine condition.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Venkmen</div><div class="date">03-01-2005, 01:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The thing is....when the devs are programing this stuff they can not program in for every variable with every system out there.  Every time SoE patches there are bits of the code that are changed that neither you nor I can see.  Every time.  Stuff like ports that are accessed on the network interface of your card, bits of code to help optimize the memory usuage in your computer, the way that the game interacts with video drivers and newer cards, all sorts of things that are not in the patch message.  Any group of things that could effect your particualr system setup in an abnormal way.  The devs have no way to test the code that is implmented for every system configuration that EQ players have.<br />
<br />
The next patch might change one of these things again to a way that your system has no issues with.  <br />
<br />
I am just throwing out some situations that I have had experience with man. I know you are not directing any anger my way.  I am just trying to help you understand that there are many variables that are somewhat out of control for you and the devs.  <br />
<br />
<br />
As for the video card.  If you have a spare laying around you might try switching it in real quick and see if that helps.  Alot of computer components can appear to be in great shape, but be on the way out.  <br />
<br />
<br />
I really hope you can get this figured out soon bud.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarcazzm</div><div class="date">03-01-2005, 01:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks for the replies, not trying to flame, just frustrated, but i work for arguably the leading computer hardware/software corp in the states, as a trainer in the tech support div. and i know how this stuff works. &quot;run complete file check, reinstall EQ, blah blah&quot; its just a run-around really, the GM's are completely worthless for any real technical help.<br />
<br />
they know less than i do about whats going on, or they'd at least have the decency to come up with new timesinks, because thats all their &quot;technical knowledge&quot; amounts to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Venkmen</div><div class="date">03-01-2005, 01:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah the GMs really don't know alot about the inner workings of the game and the technical aspects of the it.  They really are more along the lines of customer support then tech advisors.  I will say though that there are some of them that know a few things about the inner workings of the game itself, but they are few and far between.</div></div><hr />
