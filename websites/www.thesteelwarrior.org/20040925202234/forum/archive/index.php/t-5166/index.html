Seems silly to me, but he made some $$.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'd welcome you to last week, but even though this has already been posted, it's not the same, annoying, only-funny-when-you're-high badgerbadgerbadger crap that gets linked around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xocin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It's really more sad than funny..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Actually, if you think about it, this is pretty significant on a couple of levels.<br />
<br />
 First, him being able to claim the items are property and having the court agree.<br />
<br />
 Second, the claim that the items were not only property, but HIS property.<br />

 It will either legalize a Sony crackdown on Yantis et. al. if the first point is upheld and the second not, or it will legalize third party virtual goods sales if both points are seen to be within the law.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">This is a precedant in a fairly loosely defined area of law...interesting interpretation.  Be even more interesting to see where this leads.</div></div><hr />

Or it will turn out that Chinese and U.S. laws differ and a third possibility enters the ring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">bah i dont want to pay property taxes on my sims house. or sales tax on my eq milk i just bought. or compensation to guard valons family after a wrongful death suit.<br />
<br />
the funny part is the made the game company pay and not the guy who stole it. think of the precident this could set in real life. sueing your landlord for all  stuff some theif stole because of lack of security, but it was a furnished apartment everything but your clothes and laptop was the landlords. the thief dumped out your clothes though and you had your laptop at work with you. so in effect the landlord has to pay you for his stuff that was stolen by someone else.<br />

i seriously hope our laws are not like china</div></div><hr />
