<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rainingvodka</div><div class="date">07-30-2004, 09:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Last night my guild took down the cursed cycle in Ssra.  Being the only guild warrior present, I was awarded the Bloodfrenzy by default! (and man am I gonna be in the dkp hole forever after this latest purchase).<br />
<br />
My question then is the offhand.  I currently wield a windspeeder in that slot (unaugmented).  I have a SS belt tho that i just haven't seen fit to replace because it's got decent stats and it's nice to have flexibility in wpn combo...while still retaining that haste.<br />
<br />
i was using a GBoS in my mainhand for a while -- now replaced by the BF when I MT.  should i switch the GBoS to offhand and eat the 10% loss in haste until I can anger aug the windspeeder?  Should i ditch the windspeeder for good unless playing DPS only and instead anger aug the GBoS?<br />
<br />
i understand how haste doesn't affect proc/hate but simply spreads it out more evenly...but i just can't make up my mind. 10% makes for a lot of lost DPS.  I know MT aren't there for DPS but i just love swinging fast =)<br />
<br />
i have a set of ornate gaunts so I'm still looking at 61% haste minimum even without a better spell buff.  has the windspeeder now served it's last MT offhand day?<br />
<br />
For pure DPS purposes, I'm thinking my Wrath's Edge mainhand and the windspeeder secondary (non anger auged).  Then I can have the BF augged or not + the GBoS anger augged for my hate setup.  I lose 10% haste on the hate combo but with that much hate...10% doesn't matter since haste is for DPS anyways...right?<br />
<br />
i'm kinda rambling maybe.  been a very late night.  your thoughts and suggestions are welcome.<br />
Here is my magelo.  maybe u can just look and my options will make more sense:<br />

<br />
turning in FH breastplates seems the easist tribute so far, 15k tribute each and only cost 7k or so in bazzar</div></div><hr />

aug them as soon as possible for an even beter setup.<br />
for the haste, it helps alot the swing hate, but 10%  won't match the diff from proc on long fight. Moreover you can ask  for Wonderous Rapidity (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=1709&amp;source=Live) to be max hasted again. <br />
and for DPS (not tanking) your choice is wise (actually GBoS is better DPS than the WS which is better than W'E, but if the MT is not DW a 4aggro proc combo, you might get him mad if you use your previous aggro setup for dps).</div></div><hr />

Try to get belt of the destroyer or if you guys ever kill dozekar/HoT can try to go for dozekar quest wrist haste but that would most likely be a pain for you to get heh.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Friedrick</div><div class="date">07-30-2004, 05:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not everyone has thousands of pp for tribute haste or time for farming tribute loot.  I use Tribute on the named on raids for ac/hps and it is pricey imo for what you get for tribute values.  If I used it as an everyday thing I would spend a lot of time farming for tribute stats.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">07-30-2004, 06:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Let's keep some perspective on tribute.  When you spend tribute, you are essentially paying in installments for a nodrop item.<br />
<br />
41% haste costs about 8kpp/month of tribute items, if enabled for 20 hrs/week.<br />
31% haste costs about 4kpp/month of tribute items, if enabled for 20 hrs/week.<br />
<br />
I bet that a lot of people have exceeded this cost on many of their nodrop items.<br />
<br />
For example: if you paid 40kpp for a piece of ornate armor, and then replaced it within 9 months, then that piece of armor cost you more than tribute haste.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ibithor</div><div class="date">07-31-2004, 03:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">considering that you can turn in crap weapons from ldons for 20-50 tribute each and fierce heraldic breastplates for 15k tribute each, tribute isnt that hard to keep up<br />
<br />
when you get to the point where there are no buyable upgrades you want, what else are you gona spend money on? alts? fuck that it gets old fast</div></div><hr />
