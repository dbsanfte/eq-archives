I was going through some old emails my wife had sent me when i found this...<br />
<br />
                                         The School Report<br />
<br />
Son: &quot;Daddy, I have to write a special report for school, but I don't know what politics is.&quot;<br />
<br />
Father: &quot;Well, let's take our home for an example. I am the bread-winner, so let's call me Capitalism. Your Mum is the administrator of money, so we'll call her the government. We take care of your needs, so let's call you the people. We'll call the maid the working class and your brother we can call the future. Do you understand son?&quot;<br />
<br />
Son: &quot;I'm not really sure, dad. I'll have to think about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
That night awakened by his brother's crying, the boy went to see what was wrong. Discovering the baby had seriously soiled his diaper, the boy went to his parents' room and found his mother sound asleap. He went to the maids' room, where, peeking through the keyhole, he saw his father in bed with the maid. The boy's knocking went totally unheaded by his father and the maid, so the boy went back to his room and went back to sleep.<br />
<br />
The next morning he reported to his father.<br />
<br />
Son: &quot;Dad, now I think I understand what Politics is.&quot;<br />
<br />
Father: &quot;Good son! Can you explain it to me in your own words?&quot;<br />
<br />
Son: &quot;Well Dad, While Capitalism is screwing the Working Class, Government is sound asleap, the People are being completely ignored and the Future is full of $hit.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
I thought this was kinda funny  :D</div></div><hr />

Dan Rather was interviewing Henry Kissinger and pointedly asked if it bothered him that the Consitution prevented him from ever becoming President. &quot;No.&quot;, mused Sec. Kissinger, &quot;Fortunately the Constitution doesn't say a word about Emporer.&quot;<br />
