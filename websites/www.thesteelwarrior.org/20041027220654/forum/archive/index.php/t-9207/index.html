<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mbahansen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has anyone started looking at the player made augments that came out with OOW?  They have some awsome effects like Improved Dodge +30%, Double attack +9% Dot Sheilding and on and on.  <br />
<br />
If you have looked at them have you thought about what you would like to have as a Warrior?  I know I would like the Dot Sheilding/Improved Dodge.<br />
<br />
Finally for those with Time+ gear do some of theses stack like can a +30% dodge stack with a +30% dodge or is it just the highest level on any single item that is in effect?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

In the messageboard section people post the stats of stuff as they make it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>mbahansen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ya, I know where everything drops and how they are made and what the effects are.  I was hoping someone would be able to tell me how they stacked.  What effects are the most usefull as a warrior?  And finally what combination of augs they would like to have.<br />
<br />
PS:  I did search first and these questions were not answered that I could see that is why I started a new thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bulbog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Pretty sure the effects don't stack(ie dodge 3 + dodge 3)  However the effects aren't new, they game out with GoD, so there may be some posts about it discussing GoD.  What I'm shooting for is just a 45hp Improved Dodge 3 aug to stick my gaunts.  People were trying to get some parses done of like Improved Dodge/parry and such but I don't know if it ever happened.</div></div><hr />

My brother was trying to tell me the DOT shielding ruled, but with only +3 I can't imagine it would make a big differance.  A plus 30% dodge must be worth if though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bulbog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Oh, dot shielding/spell shielding stack up to 35%.  Just meant improved dodge/fero/cleave don't stack pretty sure.</div></div><hr />

Cool, That helps.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kizef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I made myself a 12agil 40% haste aug. I think this is the best a warrior can get. 40% haste that can go into slt 7 or 8, and fits into 5 or 6 different armor pieces.<br />
<br />
The 12agil is becuase I failed on my MR and SS aigs /cry.<br />
<br />
I plan on getting a faerune aug and Im looking into the dodge ones as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Findra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The problem with most of these augs is that they only go into the LDoC AC aug slots (Face, Neck, Back, Shoulders, Waist), with the exception of the HP aug (Kyanite (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=72698) ) and the regen aug (Titanite (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=75341) ) and the mana/end aug (can't remember name, but I think it can go in a wrist slot).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>GraniteMG</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Radiant Kyanite of Pure Dexterity  (45h + 30% dodge)<br />
Radiant Kyanite of Pure Ferocity    (45hp + 9% double Attack)<br />
<br />
90hp<br />
+aggro/dps<br />
+avoidance<br />
<br />
in place of where 80hp's use to be seems like a nice boost.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure the spellshield/dot shielding are worth sacrificing AC though. If something is doing a 1500pt AE every 30 seconds, you're preventing a staggering 45pts of damage everytime that AE cycles.</div></div><hr />
