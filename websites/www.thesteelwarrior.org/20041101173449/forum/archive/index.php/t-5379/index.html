[Sun Jan 25 09:20:25 2004] You say, 'frostreaver, unbuffed, Dex 180, katta banker, from behind, 41% haste, level 65'<br />
<br />
1. hits = 4107, damage = 610395, average/hit = 148.62308, Elapsed fight time = 10493, DPS = 58.17164<br />
******************** totals (augmented by (0))<br />
Hits = 4107, damage = 610395, time = 10493 seconds (2h54m53s), dps = 58.17164<br />
There were 0 anger procs, which is one every Infinity seconds<br />
There were 0 avatar procs, which is one every Infinity seconds<br />
There were 262 Frostreaver procs, which is one every 40.049618 seconds</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Haste item?<br />
<br />
And what might be more useful is knowing your level (assume 65), attack value and the graph of hits distribution.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mystaviant</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Not sure what the point of the parse was, but as far as proc rates go, at 180 Dex, you should be somewhere between 1 and 2 procs per minute, which is exactly what you have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Squizer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">IF dex affects linearly the proc rate, then at 305 dex the Frostreaver would proc every 23.6358 secs ( assuming 0 dex = 0 proc in fact ). That's above average weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Haste item? <br />
<br />
Haste has no impact on proc rates.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Haste is 41%.   The point? Mainly the proc rate and idle curiosity.<br />
<br />
assuming 0 dex = 0 proc in fact <br />
<br />
Unlikely, extrapolating from data on this thread (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=5351)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">DPS = 58.17164<br />
<br />
That is the point.<br />
<br />
So I repeat, haste item. We already know most itmes proc about once every 45 seconds (though its always good to test and confirm this).<br />
<br />
So yeah, if you are going to bench mark something, and list DPS, well then we need to know haste. <br />
<br />
I still think the hits distribution graph would be one of hte more interesting things (though, again not effected by haste).<br />
<br />
Besides if we get enough tests against the Katta banker, we can build a relationship between attack and DPS, and see if there are break values too, where distributions chance. (ANd maybe even beable to test for level too effects too.)<br />
<br />
Rarely can you have too much info.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Rarely can you have too much info.&quot;<br />
<br />
THAT DEPENDS on the conversation!<br />
<br />
... Derail done.<br />
<br />
Continue with your discussion.<br />
<br />
:P</div></div><hr />

<br />
Cough 30 seconds.<br />
<br />
And boy that thing is shit for DPS.  My dual wield beats that, with less haste.</div></div><hr />

<br />
CAN WE PLEASE STOP THE BULLSHIT !<br />
<br />
305DEX = 2 PROCS PER MINUTE<br />
<br />
LEARN IT  <br />
<br />
No clue on the linearity however.<br />
And its like that for 99% of warrior usable weapons.</div></div><hr />
