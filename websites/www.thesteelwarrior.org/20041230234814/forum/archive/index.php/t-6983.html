I tried like hell to figure it out while going through some LDoN adventures this weekend, but text in my various windows was rolling by too fast for me to even notice the message, much less speculate which filter it might be on.  I'd like to move that filtered item to a much less active window so I can be sure it's activating properly, but can't figure out what filter I need to set.<br />
<br />
Anyone know this?</div></div><hr />

*Aggrowhore begins to use Feysboil as a living shield!* and *Feysboil ceases protecting Aggrowhore* are under Filters &gt; Melee &gt; Your Hits (/boggle).<br />
<br />
*You must first target a living PC Character*, *Your target is too far away, get closer!* (and any others) are under Filters &gt; Skills.<br />
<br />
*You may use the abilite /shield again in ... * is under Filters &gt; Melee &gt; Disciplines.</div></div><hr />

They don't make logical sense as to where they are, but OK... pretty much rules out me putting the activation/end messages into a window by themselves, but maybe I can at least  filter my skills to a window that isn't scrolling by, so I can catch the error messages (target/out of range).<br />
<br />
Thanks a bunch!</div></div><hr />
