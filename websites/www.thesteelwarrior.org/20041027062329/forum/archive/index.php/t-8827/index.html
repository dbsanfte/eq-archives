If you have, please post classes in group, what type of gear was typical if you know (Velious, VT, Ele, Time, etc), and how many attempts you made before you succeeded.<br />

If you wonder why I'm asking, over at The Runes - we've been berating SoE for creating these trials where it seems impossible without a charmed pet - then turning around and creating other events where chanters are useless (or close to).

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Froggerx Xreggorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Its easier without a chanter, no having to worry about the damn pet breaking and owning your cleric and backup rezzer or whatever you have in the group, I've been flagging my whole guild through this with the same 2 people (flagging 3 at a time).<br />
<br />
Does take longer but...these aren't made for people pre-elemental. Hell alot of GoD is for people who've farmed the hell outta time or you get raped over and over and over again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>GorfinML</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i tanked(9.3k, 1700) tipt with a charmed pet for dps..<br />
<br />
i continly got my ass handed to me.  group was me, cleric, enc ranger pala magi...was lucky to only die twice(one was a wipe, other was slow clerics syndrome)<br />
<br />
if your not bringing a pet for dps, and arent time lvl tank, bring a 2nd dedicated healer, and 4 hours to kill</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">A group of my guildmates (mid-elementals) beat Vxed in 2 hours with: mage, mage, mage, druid, cleric, shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bulbog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well for both they're basically just something to boost up your clear speed.  For vxed at least it won't be the determining factor if you win or not, well provided you don't require the pet to tank or something which you shouldn't with people wanting to get them done really.  Tipt, some could argue they need the pet's dps on the final named but it's definantly doable without also.  For a non pet group setup I personally like: war, rng, bard, shm, cleric, dps(rogue/mage/wiz generally)  Basically ranger pulls with warrior tag, ranger snares or whatever to generate aggro with bard dispelling it as it's running in.  Ranger pops WS, all debuffs in, ranger calls for ws down, ae taunt to furious, shaman lay some dots if they want at that point then basically the shaman and cleric switch off chaining daluda's/tnargs and holy/supernal light.  <br />
<br />
If you don't like avoidance discs gimping it you can do it with a cleric, druid, tank, shaman/enc setup.  The better beneficial spell haste or spell haste in general the healers have, healing focus and healing aa's also help a lot.</div></div><hr />

Nokei<br />
<br />
Info you asked for:<br />
<br />
Vxed - no pet.<br />
Tipt, charmed pet for dps on Jhiru.<br />
<br />
Classes were war, clr, nec, enc, shm, mag.<br />
For Vxed / Tipt our best gear was ldon merchant, ldon hard mode, ornate, average aa was around 375-400.<br />
Vxed, 1 attempt, Tipt, about 3 (no pet on any but last, and not until Jhiru's room).<br />
<br />
I wont let our group use charmed mobs (dont have to try too hard since we all hate it, dont have charm friendly snare anyway), the only exception being Jhiru since at the time we saw no other way.  We might have been able to beat him w/o it, since there is no charming in Ikkinz yet we recently beat DD w/o a pet.<br />
<br />
I would like to prepare you for the onslaught of flames you are about to get though.  There are many here who believe that if Vxed / Tipt are too tough for you, and as you say 'it seems impossible without a charmed pet', then your tank is weak and needs to gear up, or maybe the content is not made for you, whatever.  I disagree.  It can be done and it has been done w/o a pet.  I regret using a pet for dps on Jhiru since it does take away a lot of the thrill of victory, but since our DD win I dont feel quite so bad :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fynepisa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I did both before any tuning (not sure if it's easier or harder now) with a bazaar/LDoN level group: war, rng, pal, enc, rog, clr for both. We didn't use a pet at all for either since we were all 2 boxing and it was easier to not worry about the pet.<br />
<br />
For Jhiru I had around 9.3k 1800ac. We started WS, then furious. Fight lasted about a minute and I dropped at 11%, then pal shortly after. Rog dropped nimble and we finished him off. After that we used pet on Jhiru to ensure victory, but it's most definately doable without great gear and without a pet.<br />
<br />
p.s. Grats Moruk on the DD win!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>ibithor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">if your tank cant handle vxed/tipt without a chanter he cant tank well in KT, the normal mobs are close to vxed/tipt trash and the random named will tear thru you like a hot knife thru nome fat butter. cragbeast rager for example hits me for 1100+ while defensive and i think everything in the zone can quad hit<br />
<br />
charmed pet makes doing trials faster and more bearable, but they are definitely not needed. to me a ranger is more critical than a chanter. 24 seconds is a loooong time :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tarn Rider</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I've done Vxed with no chanter or mezzer what so ever, this was done on my Main, a Ranger.<br />
<br />
The gear was Elemental, Time Gear, and some minor GoD gear for most people.<br />
<br />
The group make up was a Warrior, Cleric, Shaman, Ranger(Me), Monk, Necro.<br />
<br />
The monk pulled Single Pulls each time, since with 6 hours it certainly isn't a rush rush type of thing. <br />
<br />
The killing of the 50 was a bit annoying, without the added Charmed DPS, but we did alright, and mana seemed to be fine. Generally kill ten, have a brief rest for Cleric's mana, and keep going.<br />
<br />
Once we killed the 50 to spawn the hail NPC, then the Monk &amp; Necro did their things. <br />
<br />
With a combination of Invis &amp; Feign Death, the Monk &amp; Necro made their way up to the room. The Necro would FD, the monk would tag several mobs ahead, draw them down the path, the necro would jump up running, and move further up. Clearing the way for one another.<br />
<br />
The Necro got to the room, and the monk was stuck part way down from the last pull of mobs to give the Necro a clear shot.<br />
<br />
So then we basically all went and found a mob and killed ourselves. We zoned back in. On the walli n the last room, high on the wall, to the side of the tombstone exit, there is a safe spot. you can stand there, not moving much and be agro free. the necro summoned the body of the Cleric, used an EE to rez the cleric. Then summoned the rest of our bodies, and the cleric clicked us.<br />
<br />
We did our hails, then quickly clicked the tombstone.<br />
<br />
It may not of been the most efficient, but it worked for getting people their flags.<br />
<br />
Again, this was in Vxed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bonequest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I completed Vxed with Me (65 war 8.7k hp 1500 AC at the time), a 65 bard puller, 65 shaman, 65 cleric, 65 ranger, and 65 wizard.  Other than myself and the ranger, none were in elemental guilds and it was a random pick up group.  We had one death the whole time(shaman) from slow agro (mob resisted 3 or 4  times) and we won the trial and beat the named that drops some decent (110 hp?) plate legs.<br />
<br />
Never done Tipt without an enchanter though but I am sure a similar group could probably do it although you might have to swap the wiz for a druid.  It would be harder though since you can not use defensive on the named in Tipt that you have to kill to win.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Hinterdir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">i've done Jihru with War(me), Clr, Bst, Nec, Dru and Ranger ~~ Guild was exploring Uqua at the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tinuvil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">if you arent sure - bring a necro</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Nilana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I have done both without a pet.  I personally prefer no pets as it does add alot of dps but doesn't seem work it most of the time with charm breaks.  Only one of my group (monk)was time geared/god geared on our first attempt in Tipt.  My group was me, monk, cleric, shaman, necro, and rogue (I think).  The time/god geared monk ended up leaving the group for Jiru to allow one of my guildies (another monk) in who needed the flag.  My guild at the time was only doing VT and we are now slowly moving into the elementals (no elemental gear for any of us even now).<br />
<br />
Good luck on your next attempt!<br />
<br />
It is possible to do this pre-elementals, I also tank in KT regularly.  My normal group there is myself, another warrior, cleric, monk, rogue, and shaman.  So far we have never wiped to a named in there and I can't remember the last time we wiped period.  <br />
<br />
Due to reading above I figured I would also add this comment.  The way we do named in Tipt is simply have monk pull named back to camp, do their invul thing, then I get aggro and go furious.  I have also seen groups do a chain of Invul where you do monk, then ranger, then warrior who has to immediately take it off ranger to allow them to TS for the dps.  You let the ranger or monk die and you may lack the dps though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I've done Vxed without an enchanter twice.  Haven't actually won tipt without one, but I have no doubt that it's very doable.  My losses are due to stupidity more often than not.  What seems to get non-enchanter groups more than anything is respawn.  If you don't have a high-dps group in Tipt you need to pay a lot of attention to respawn times cause respawn in the middle of a fight there is usually death.  Especially if you don't have a mezzer.<br />
<br />
A necro is very nice to have along in Vxed/Tipt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Brokkah Narrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Done both without, Tipt group was War, Clr, Rng, Pal, Pal,Sk. Yes it took a while to clear :P Jhiru was just lucky I survived to be honest but it can be done. I pulled too btw, pretty much everything is singled, even the key dropping part with a bag full of invis potions. The undead part we did in stages with 1 being totally CCed by the ranger, worked a treat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>korgo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I've straight tanked Jhiru a few times with no enchanter pet.<br />
<br />
The group each time consisted of Me, Shm, Cleric (with Holy Light),  Druid w. god heal, Bard and mage.<br />
<br />
Our gear level was late elemental but no Time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Vanidor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I've done Vxed with no enchanter pet. The group was:<br />
9.6 K Shadowknight (mixed VT, one or two elemental molds)<br />
9k Bard (mixed Time+post Kod'Taz equipment)<br />
Ranger, (mixed VT)<br />
Cleric (VT/ssra)<br />
Druid (VT/ssra)<br />
Monk (ornate armour roughly)<br />
<br />
We killed Umbiki 3 times, Chavoor 2 times, then plowed on to win. The named were very very close fights, often the 2-3 melee would be dead at the end of each kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Callon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">The thing is many groups can't get past Jhiru in Tipt without the charmed pet dps.  When I got flagged we barely beat Jhiru with charmed pet dps plus ranger WS plus my riposte disc.  I still died.  Fortunately Jhiru died right after I did.  The charmed pet also makes it a lot faster and makes it doable for groups that don't have an elem/time geared tank.  I have no elem+ gear, just near maxed on pre elem/god gear and lots of AAs.  <br />
<br />
With no chanter at all I got through eh... 30 kills or so in Vxed one night.  Then we died because of a roaming respawn.  Apparently some of the crag have a huge roaming range because we thought we were well past the range of the first roamer we'd killed... then it respawned on our cleric's head.  It's just hard to get enough dps to stay ahead of it.  On the other hand with a charmed pet, my groups have little trouble with Vxed.   The difference is huge and of course the exp rate basically doubles.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Did vxed this weekend without a pet, and with a bunch of noobs, most of whom hadn't done anything in GoD before. Poor necro had to burn a couple ee' s because the cleric didn't know where to buy invis potions, or how to get to vxed by himself. We weren't supposed to be getting the flag either, so when the dude popped, we had to reclear part way, and then invis/paci up, which noone knew how to do so a couple people got screwed out of their flags.<br />
<br />
Anyway, it can be done (without any ubers, too), although since our dps sucked HARD it took for freakin' ever.</div></div><hr />
