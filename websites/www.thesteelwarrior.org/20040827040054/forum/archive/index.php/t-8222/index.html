I didnt modify any of the settings, but with the 30 sec maximum recording time you're limited to in the demo, my test movie of me getting on my horse and lev'ing myself made a file over 230 megs...<br />
<br />
Really cool program but unless there's a way to make these a bit more managable, I dont think ill be using it often.</div></div><hr />

Don't take a full 30 second clip all at once. It's best to take smaller clips ata time, then piece them together into a video editor. You can also reduce the number of FPS, do half screen and turn off sound. Those will help reduce the file size.<br />
<br />
I use Adobe Premiere Pro to piece my footage together, but you can use the free Windows MediaMaker 2 to do it (available from the microsoft update website).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ratsan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">1 - Don't use software based capture if you really want to put together and edit movies. You are better off with a hardware capture to video tape. Two reasons. It wont clutter your hard drive. And you dont have to worry about starting and stopping recording. Just pop a tabe in and record. You en up with more to work with and more is good.<br />
<br />
2 - One you compress the vide it can not be edited or should not. The uncompressed source is best to edit with. The final product you compress not the source.<br />
<br />
3- The source or uncompressed video is extreamly large. By takeing what you need from vido tape instead of all the video on your harddrive you save disk space. You will be working with gig's worth of vido just to make a few min movie.<br />
<br />
4 - many vido cards vido out does not work at the same time as there monitor out therefore it's almost useless to use. Many gforce cards are this way.<br />
<br />
5 - There are many methods of capturing the video. Quality is a function of how much money you spend on equipment.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ratsan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">One of my movies. (http://stateofthegame.50megs.com/mov/PoI_Dragon.wmv) <br />
<br />
This movie was made useing a spliter that takes the signal from the monitor cable and allows you to pipe it to standard video.<br />
<br />
I then used video capture card to pipe the video into another computer for editing.<br />
about $300 total in equipment not counting the computers and VCR.<br />
<br />
I was rather disapointed that the quaity did not go up with the video capture card. Prior to that I was useing a USB device to pipe the video back into a computer for editing. This video was done this way.<br />
<br />
Example (http://stateofthegame.50megs.com/mov/sola_2.wmv)<br />
<br />
To increase the quality of mine I need a better capture. The best would be a pure copy from one computer to another staying purely digital but there is limitations depending on the speed of the computers hardware. There are intermediate options as well. But they are vary expensive. The one I make will likely stay as they are.<br />
<br />
Some videos you find will have nifty cut screens, fades, video on video...exc... That is a result of the editing software. Some costs as much as $5,000. People with that are not useing it excluseivly for game movies though, unless there nuts.</div></div><hr />
