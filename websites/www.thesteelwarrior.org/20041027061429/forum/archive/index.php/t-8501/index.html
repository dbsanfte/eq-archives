<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>WaardarMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Heard a rumor that shielding caps at 15%.<br />
<br />
Anyone care to comment?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Throag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">bullshit<br />
<br />
A lot of people are over 25% and still see it working</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>lanolar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Even for non-warriors it seems to be testing to be over 20% so far. Nice to know they did not put in some lame super low cap for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It's unknown.  35% is my guess, since that's what the spellshield cap is at.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>WaardarMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Cool, just had a guy in guild say it and I'd never heard one way or another.<br />
<br />
Thanx for the input</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>kinuvan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Bard here, 28% and still working fine.<br />
<br />
                           Davan has 36% but I haven't managed to get time to test if the cap is indeed 35, I will tomorow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>kinuvan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Tested on a tacvi golem:<br />
<br />
                 28% shielding = 527 min hit<br />
                 33% shielding = 502 min hit <br />
<br />
          Therefore you get 5 point of dmg reduction per shielding point.<br />
<br />
                 36% shielding = 492 min hit.<br />
                 35% = 492 Min hit.<br />
<br />
                             Cap is 35.</div></div><hr />

Jesus, this really seems like an all but worthless mod for gear. I realise any mitigation is good and you should strive for what you can get... but seriously... the coded dmg bonus for GoD mobs is freakin huge! For shielding to only work X% over the mobs damage bonus seems a bit retarded when they have a DB of 500+.<br />
<br />
I know there's parses and stuff around that compare Avoidance to Shielding, but wouldn't the Dmg bonus of the mob have alot to do with which was better? I'm thinking Avoidance has to &gt; Shielding over all for high end GoD mobs with huge dmg bonuses, since (hopefully by this time) your AC should be doing well against their attack ratings.<br />
<br />
Disclaimer:<br />
 Just shooting from the hip here... I've never even attempted to use a parsing program of any kind, it seems this way to me.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>kinuvan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Shielding is neat on tunat muram !! ( 3100 DB :p)<br />
<br />
                  You inversed DB and DI Waardar but ya shielding is useless while xping ( db is like 200 tops for a max hit for 1K +) and it vary greatly in raid. For exemple first goat in tacvi hit for 600min 6k max. Next boss hit for 1200 min 6000 max and tunat is DB 3100 DI 50.<br />
<br />
                        Soooo shielding is crap on goat, ok on pixxt and really good on tunat. Avoidance is good everywhere :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kaidog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Which Time mods have a proven cap at 35%?  Someone said spell shielding and shielding...anything else?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Darkgecko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Which Time mods have a proven cap at 35%?  Someone said spell shielding and shielding...anything else?<br />
<br />
Spell Shield and Shielding are easy to test, because they are simple numerical values, and Spell Shield definitely caps at 35%.  Shielding I can't confirm, but it's over 30%.  Wont be long before there's quite a few 35% shielding people in tacvi.<br />
Unless a dev came right out and said it, I dont think you can really prove any others.  Perhaps by dueling you could test the cap on DoT shielding, but proving Strikethrough, for instance, would be a pita, would need a whole lot of parsing.<br />
I'm going to go with the pattern and assume they all cap at 35%.</div></div><hr />

I was under the impression that Shielding modified the mob's DI. So that if you had a mob with a DI of 200, a DB of 2000, normal hit distribution would be:<br />
<br />
2000<br />
2200<br />
2400<br />
2600<br />
<br />
But with, say, 10% shielding, it would look like:<br />
<br />
1980<br />
2180<br />
2380<br />
2580<br />
<br />
And so on. Is that correct or, in the above scenario, would it instead be:<br />
<br />
1800<br />
2000<br />
2200<br />
2400<br />
<br />
from Shielding modifying the DB of 2000, rather then the DI of 200?<br />
<br />
OR<br />
<br />
Does it modify each interval per hit? IE would it look like this with 10% shielding:<br />
<br />
2000<br />
2180<br />
2340<br />
2480<br />
2600<br />
<br />
IE would the shielding stack across the distribution spectrum?<br />
<br />
I know this has been answered before (by Thep iirc), but it's been so long and I didn't keep track of it heh. Which one is it?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>R27</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">It reduces DB, not DI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Shielding modifies the DB<br />
<br />
Defensive modifies the DI  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Archonfire</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">So the second shielding example is the correct one then?<br />
<br />
Thanks guys.</div></div><hr />
