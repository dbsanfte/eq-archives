I about to build me a new machine and I want the best for my buck. What video card would you get if you where building a brand new machine?  I plan on going AMD mother board max ram. Iwant to max out the video card as well. So Do i go with the ATI 9800 pro 256 or get the Geforce 6800?</div></div><hr />

All I can say is that I've used a Radeon 9700 Pro for a year or so now and have never had problems.  Its fast as hell, as in I only have to turn spell effects off for visibility. <br />

<br />
NV's cards are slower and more expensive (until the G6 comes out atleast)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">04-15-2004, 09:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">thats because ATI's new baby is still relativley new and there hasn't been a need to update anything. Mark my words for when something new OS related comes out or a new game that wont work quiet right with the card.</div></div><hr />

I'm currently using a Radeon 9800 Pro with an Athlon64 and it simply rocks.  The new NVidia 6800 has some insane benchmarks at high resolutions, but costs a small fortune.  If you don't want to spend the $500 for the NVidia, I'd get an ATI 9800 Pro (XT costs way too much for a very small performance boost) as a good card for a decent price ($200 or less)</div></div><hr />

I'm not sure why I  care so much, but all I can say I that I've had to trouble with my ATI 9700 Pro.  Drivers have been updated just fine.  DirectX 9 has been working on my machine for several months.</div></div><hr />

ATI chips are only found in cards made by ATI.  Nvidia allows other companies to take their chips and manufacturer them around their own boards and desighn and system specs.  This too me shows competition between manufacturers to produce a quality card and a chip manufacturer to give quality support for all of their vendors.  If ATI doesnt put out a quality chip or quality drivers they don't have 10 or so vendors breathing down their necks. <br />
<br />
I give a thumbs up to Nvidia.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alisdahre</div><div class="date">04-15-2004, 12:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd go Intel chip.  Both AMDs I've had, and 2 others that I've seen friends with, have all burnt themselves up under normal usage (no overclocking or anything, case fans all over the place).  My Intel chips, with nothing more than the CPU fan alone in the case, not a single overheating problem ever.<br />
<br />
I'd also go Nvidia.  I've never had a problem with the drivers nor performance.  I've had ATI drivers error out during installation and take the entire operating install with them multiple times.  Also, almost everytime I read about someone complain about their video card (spanning many different games and gaming web sites), most of the time it was an ATI.<br />
<br />
I think ATI cards have a sharper picture.  Nice image quality and vivid color.  But they don't have the consistantly high frame rates, ease of driver installs/upgrades, game compadibility, and stability that I've seen using Nvidia.<br />
<br />
These are just my experiences though.  A lot of people have had wonderful results with ATI and AMD.  Myself though, getting burned once is one thing... but personally seeing 4 AMDs fail in the last few years, reading constant complaints of games not working from ATI users, and having to reinstall entire operating systems multiple times cause of failed driver installs, has swayed me away from them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ealsur Helevorn</div><div class="date">04-15-2004, 02:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">AMD chips were known for getting higher temps than Intel's. But I have been running a AthlonXP for more than a year with no problems, I have always hated Intel for making their CPUs more expensive, with no real reason, AMD has always been cheaper and since the Athlon series (or maybe a bit earlier), I didnt find any reason to say Intel is better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caldron</div><div class="date">04-15-2004, 03:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I go with nVidia as well I actully bought the last card for me and the wife from DELL are 256mb cards and inexpensive too. No need to have a DELL to buy from them was the best pricing I found.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anakun</div><div class="date">04-15-2004, 03:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for all the replies so far.  I recently came into some cash so i want to upgrade my &quot;MACHINE&quot; first thing.  Yeah I prefer AMD been using it for the past two years now. and had no problems with it.  I use to be a die hard Pentium guy but AMD lower price for better performance pulled me to the dark side. <br />
<br />
Any ways yeah I am leaning towards the ATI due to Picture quality but still not sure. The XT looks like an awesome gaming board to me but not sure if i want the XT over the pro other than the on board RAM. And if I go Nvida i will have to wait till the newest board comes out so i do not feel bad later on.  I can play EQ now with my ATI 7800 64mb card but i run no particle effects and sky off and no music running. I play with all the luclin graphics on becuse i think the orginal ones blow monkey weiners, and i figure why play a game if you hate to look at the screen.  I want to be able to play with max graphics on and still attend a raid. I want to only turn the spell effects off so i can see the target i am tanking lol. any ways like i said keep the input flowing plan on running to Frys saturday and Filling my basket with goodies and I want to know if need ot just stick with current Graphics card till the newest Nvida comes out or just snatch me a new ATI off the shelf.<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: also any of you AMD users out there. is there  a particular Mother board i should look for that you have used or been drooling for?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shaiel</div><div class="date">04-15-2004, 04:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got the board from MSI.  It has dynamic over/underclocking available to it.  While idle, it'll underclock your CPU to save power and lower the fan speed/noise.  While under heavy load, it can overclock itself up to 10%, based upon BIOS settings.  There's also a program that lets you adjust these settings right in windows, giving memory and CPU voltage, clock speeds, etc, without having to reboot constantly to see if it's stable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">04-15-2004, 04:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">People need to stop saying that ATI doesn't update drivers. They update more often than nVidia and have been for about the last 18 months.<br />
<br />
ATI will give you better quality at almost the exact same speed as nVidia chipsets, sometimes even faster.<br />
<br />
nVidia cards are built purely for speed and image quality comes second.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ealsur Helevorn</div><div class="date">04-16-2004, 08:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">About mobos, I use an Abit one, the KG7 line, its kinda old right now (supports up to 2Ghz chips I think), but it proves that Abit can make an awesome board for the performance freak, it can be tuned anywhere you look at it, of course, you can screw everything with a bad tune up, but those are the risks always :p<br />
Im not up-to-date with the current market of mobos, but if Abit made a good board once, Im sure they will or did another.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mokor Leadheaad</div><div class="date">04-16-2004, 09:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">nvidia and intell pay now and get no problems or amd and ati and buy everything twice when it breaks down or burns up.<br />
<br />
#1 reason people with amd and ati stuff  have the best upgraded syaytems. because they just upgrade when it breaks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anakun</div><div class="date">04-16-2004, 10:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the only motherboard I ever fried was an Intel if that makes a difrence suppose its just luck of the draw. my current system is working good but not great  is only reaon I want to upgrade at. but i am looking t the reviews for the new Nvida and the Stats are awesome just not sure how long I can let the money for upgrading burn a hole in my pocket lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azrael</div><div class="date">04-16-2004, 10:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Really the best thing you can do is go to various sites that do reviews, such as hardocp.com.  They will give you the pros/cons of everything they review and are pretty non biased.  As for the ATI NVIDIA debate.  i used to be an nvidia fanboi until the 5900 series came out.  The ati 9800 smashed it in performance, in  picture quality and in size (it doesnt take up the ati and 1st pci slot like the nvidia.  Now i jsut read the performance specs and look at picture quality before deciding as both companies are good companies.  So far the 6800 smashes the ati 9800xt but the ati still has a slightly better picture quality.  If you can, wait for the next generation ati card to come out and decide then.</div></div><hr />
