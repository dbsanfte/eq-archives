<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>GroovinFV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have these three weapons:<br />
<br />
[Blade of Carnage]<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=25210<br />
<br />
[Cord-Hilted Spike Driver]<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=22580<br />
<br />
[An Oblong Seashell]<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=21852<br />
<br />
I am working on getting an anger 3 augment to place in one of these.  Where should I place it and what should I mainhand?  I was thinking of putting the Anger 3 aug in the Seashell and mainhanding that (aggro AND mitigation) with the BoC offhand, but I am not sure.<br />
<br />
Along these lines, how does rune work?  Let's say that I have rune2 on me.  Something smacks me for 800.  Is the 800 hit negated completely, or do i take (800-rune2) damage?<br />
<br />
So, my question to you fine people is this - given the above options, what would YOU do?  Keep in mind I am trying to have a single DW option for all situations, raid and xp group (until I get a BoW or SEWS or something like that).  Our alliance is not in the EP yet if that matters.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thalzaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Limiting yourself to just one combo really isn't what a warrior is about. I carry around a bunch of weapons and use what needs to be used in a given situation.<br />
<br />
I would say to use the BoC(main)/driver(off) if you do tanking in groups, and use shell(main)/boc(off) when not. try to pick up a non-aggro weapon because we don't always tank. It's our primary role, but sometimes you group with another warrior so you wanna be able to swap to 'dps' mode.<br />
<br />
also - rune will mitigate an attack, not negate it. So if a mob hit you for 800 and you had 200pt rune, it would land for 600.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I carry 7 weapons on me at all times, you can see them in my magelo. Sure they aren't great, but there are sometimes where I can't risk getting agro (when another war is MT'ing), or like in GoD where some mobs mitigate certain types of weapons.<br />
<br />
If a mob hits for a lot I switch to 2hb or 2hs to cut down on ripostes and save the cleric mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Keane Abrams</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I would augment the BoC with Anger 3 of those 3 choices. I would also mainhand the BoC when tanking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mokor Leadheaad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">since you on fv i guess your looking to ditch one. in that case aug the seashell and pass off/ sell the chsd.<br />
<br />
then mainhand the seashell and offhand the boc.<br />
<br />
realy though you cant go wrong with any of them. the diference is very minor overall.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">aug the BoC</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Where is that seashell from?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>GroovinFV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">seashell comes from reef of cornaiv i think, i picked it up in the bazaar (Firiona Vie server).</div></div><hr />

seashell comes from reef of cornaiv i think, i picked it up in the bazaar (Firiona Vie server).  <br />
<br />
Correct. Drops off of a few different mobs. Same mobs that drops the Plankton Laced Greatsword.<br />
<br />
I would agree with the above poster to aug the seashell and sell the driver, putting the boc in offhand. However, I am looking at it from the perspective of the shell being no drop and as such being &quot;stuck&quot; with it. Since you are on FV there may be better options that I am not thinking of atm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Dakryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Was about to stay &quot;Sell a CHSD??&quot; then realized you were on FV heh.<br />
I carry around a full bag of weapons, just used depending on what the situation calls for. One size doesnt fit all for a warrior except maybe a BoW, and then you have to be careful occasionally with aggro</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Braeorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have the same weapons, cept swith the shell with an Ivory Hilted Cleaver. <br />
<br />
I think its an easy choice, aug the boc and offhand shell or CHSD. I can't imagine aug'ing either of the others since those you will replace, the boc will be in yer bag for a long time.</div></div><hr />
