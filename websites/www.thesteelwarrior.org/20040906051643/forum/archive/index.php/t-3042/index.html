<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Marshall</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">IMO there are are three things that should be given to the warriors now that should adress (and perhaps solve) all our major issues.<br />
<br />
1) Give us better taunt. Increase the skill cap considerably. Also increase the range for taunt. Reduce its refresh timer. Makes sense, you can always cuss as fast as you want to.<br />
<br />
2) Increase our defensive skills. Give us a permanent 20% incomming melee damage reduction at level 65 and slightly increase our damage output. Seeing what other classes have gotten all these years we deserve this. Also gives lower level warriors something to look forward to for when they reach 65. Warriors are supposed to be second to none when it comes to tanking. So all the other classes except melee have become insanely powerful at level 65 all advancing in their respective disciplines, a balancing for us is due.<br />
<br />
3) Upgrade our kick / bash and make it stun higher level mobs and add aggro.<br />
<br />
As for aggro at range I don't think its a big problem. A couple of arrows at incomming always works for me (210 archery skill) unless the puller has foolishly pissed off the mob.<br />
<br />
Just my 2cp :)</div></div><hr />
