Freaking &quot;I have no problems with agro so warriors have no problems with agro and I group with my friends all the time  - they play pallies and knights and I out agro them because I have higher DPS because I'm an ogre and they play gnomes rawr phear me!&quot; freaking freaking freaking freaking freaking freak</div></div><hr />

Sorry the political commentary but it was the best example I could think of.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnomb</div><div class="date">10-15-2003, 06:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Glatius, that is a warrior who never groups with knights or only with some who are completely clueless.<br />
I have a ykesha augmented BoW, about every defensive and offensive AA there is and i can do squat when a 62/18aa pally decides he wants agro over me.<br />
<br />
P.S. of course i can get agro for a second on successful taunts, lucky streaks of procs but as soon as VoQ is available and the knight has no limit how to use his spells its over for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerald</div><div class="date">10-15-2003, 09:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If he wants to tank over you kick him out of the group? What use is he if he's tanking? He's doing less damage (attacking from the front),doesn't tank as well, and I know sure as hell you don't have agro problems so it's not to let other classes do more damage. If you have morons in your group that need to prove something, kick them out or get another group :p.<br />
<br />
I pretty much only group with friends and guildmates. I rarely group with people I don't know. I don't spend much time getting experience lately though. I've been filling my free time playing great games like Freelancer (think a little like Everquest while flying a spaceship with a COHERENT and GREAT story with TONS of places to visit and explore! has multiplayer options too).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry, but I cannot believe you.<br />
<br />
The set up you have couldnt out-aggro a wet paperbag.<br />
<br />
Well maybe a really wet one...</div></div><hr />

<br />
He's saying that the people who say that they have no problem with aggro and don't see what the big deal is what he's bitching about.<br />
<br />
And they are about as bad as paladins, IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">landrain</div><div class="date">10-15-2003, 04:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">oh so he wasnt the freak?<br />

hmm my 65 INT showing again?</div></div><hr />

don't be a h8a to us of lesser eyesight.</div></div><hr />

Trade out those ranger swords and get an agro combo from the bazaar, then put some LDoN anger 3 augs into them and come back here.</div></div><hr />

Thaak explained it well. Hes just mad cause of elemental / high end geared warriors have no problems with agro, so, some of them say, there is not such problem.<br />
<br />
Did I guess right? :)<br />
<br />
<br />
EDITED: Spelling and late at night dont mix</div></div><hr />

Yup.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dakryn</div><div class="date">10-16-2003, 12:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Can we count aggro from weapons accessable only by Elemental guilds as no fix at all?<br />
How about giving SOE the benfit of the doubt and call it a band aid</div></div><hr />

It also makes me sad that I knew what it said.  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
ummm to vent.<br />
<br />
The set up you have couldnt out-aggro a wet paperbag. <br />
<br />
You mean the SBoD and SoL? Yeah but they look cool.  Course, the GSoT which isn't on my magelo works fine for agro when it procs.<br />
<br />
dude, i'm myopic..YOU THREATENING ME?!?!?! <br />
<br />
Not really, considering I'm left-eye lazy, right eye long sighted colour blind and have next to no depth perception :D <br />
<br />
Oh, not just the elemetal prats either.  There's also the mid 50s wankers who always group with the same people, who know how to control agro and let the idiot hold it, and the idiot gets the impression their uber DPS is giving them the edge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">10-17-2003, 05:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i feel that have should not rule the have nots, as in the people that have high end eraging blow items, anger items, and alot of the other shit you hear people going on about only make up 5% of the warriors or so, i mean 2 guilds time enabled on almost each sever, some of the older  ones have more but not by much.<br />
<br />
<br />
also who did your magelo pic? that kicks ass, almost looks like the default AD&amp;D warrior, tordec</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bikamar</div><div class="date">10-19-2003, 05:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the magelo pic I found on a gallery that I've been trying to find ever since ... the guys sig is on it but I'm not sure how it reads.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smohg</div><div class="date">10-25-2003, 01:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I got a BOW and when Im not using that Im using a BF with primal until I get the proc................and I know warriors have a problem with aggro.<br />
<br />
I got plenty of twinks and the difference is astounding in the mid-fifties - its bad with the above weapons but its horrible before uber weapons. SK/pal as MT and my enchanter or shaman is slowing on inc. Warrior with better gear than the pally takes over and then Im running around after slowing - and that's slowing after 25% of the mobs life.<br />
<br />
Its a true crock of shit - for that kind of aggro knights should have about 20 hit points for it to be &quot;balanced&quot; - seriously, they have the aggro of a chain nuking wizard.<br />
<br />
And yea, I got a higher level wizard and a higher level SK - its true.</div></div><hr />
