<br />
http://www.allakhazam.com/equipment/graphics18/talisman_of_vah_kerrath.jpg<br />
<br />
I am really interested in this Talisman of Vah Kerrath. Been looking for a new neck to upgrade from Woven Shim Collar.<br />
<br />
---Blessing of Vah Kerrath:<br />
<br />
1: Increase Mana by 8 per tick<br />
2: Increase Hitpoints by 8 per tick<br />
3: Increase ATK by 20<br />
4: Ultravision<br />
5: Increase Damage Shield by 8<br />
<br />
The 8 DS works only with a spell ds like Thorny Skin ect ect. People say its really meant for casters but it is very nice... Should I go with this or a neck off Tallon Zek or another Vex Thal neck... another one in Plane of Fire off Magmaton.... Please help out ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Superchum</div><div class="date">12-29-2003, 04:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That neck is truly meant to be equipped by each CLASS and each RACE listed on it.<br />
<br />
It's great for casters. It's great for melees. It's great for hybrids.<br />
<br />
If you can get it, get it. You'll love it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">12-29-2003, 05:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">its good for everyone but no i dont think its equally good for everyone.<br />
<br />
i got one back before we were in elementals or time and its by far the best ac neck out there until you get to time.<br />
<br />
if i were each of the following classes though<br />
<br />
warrior - worth getting<br />
hybrid knights - worth getting<br />
ranger - magmaton neck<br />
monk - magmaton neck<br />
rogue - magmaton neck<br />
<br />
cleric/druid - worth getting<br />
shaman - sini neck from vt first floor or AMY neck<br />
int casters - worth getting, esp necros<br />
<br />
FT8 is huge chunk of regen in one spot for casters, much easier to work the rest of your gear with it and stay FT15.</div></div><hr />

For the same overall cost I've bought bp / ear / mask from her. If it ever went cheap enough i'd buy it, but even farming 20+ atens that day will never come :b</div></div><hr />

<br />
( yeah, it is a nice neck....ain't much out there can put that aside really )</div></div><hr />

<br />
Quoted from above for emphasis.<br />
<br />
And as a rogue who owns Magmaton neck augmented to 155hp, I disagree with the above assessment. I'd rather have Aten neck.</div></div><hr />

By a very wide margin. Now if they'd just add  fucking augment slot to the fucking thing...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Too bad those boots don't have 41 percent haste on them.<br />
<br />
:P<br />
<br />
Haste is always going to be tradeoff.<br />
<br />
No matter what slot you dedicate to haste, there will always be some item that's got more hit points or higher AC that could go in that slot.<br />
<br />
Cord of Midnight? There's quite a few belts out there with more hit points than it.<br />
<br />
Shadow Footpads, you've already mentioned boots of storm.<br />
<br />
Envenomed Moccasins, Grey Suede Boots ... same deal.<br />
<br />
Earring of Endless Speed? Have you seen the other stats on that? Haste is all it's got going for it.<br />
<br />
Shiny Trinket of Speed? That's a swapping nightmare when using a bow. And there's still some better range items than it for raw stats.<br />
<br />
Gauntlets of Dragon Slaying?<br />
<br />
Breastplate of Speed?<br />
<br />
See, it's always going to be a tradeoff.<br />
<br />
You could just quest the Silver Bracelet of Speed from Doze. That's a pretty damn good bracer no matter what.<br />
<br />
The tradeoff there, though, is the time it takes to quest it.<br />
<br />
Good luck in whatever item you choose.<br />
<br />

Some warriors are forced to make compromises based on their DKP at that exact, horrible moment...ending up in ready to BASH THINGS INTO OBLIVION in full plate armor and a pair o' flip-flops.</div></div><hr />

I really dont care about the shadowed footpads too much , already have boots of storm )Well seeing as you already do earth rings why not get a moss mantle or earthen bracer? Throw back to that get a group and kill doze and mq some symbols for a sbos.</div></div><hr />

Im using a Bplate of Eradication atm and was looking at Bplate of Speed.  If I do switch bplates , thinking im going to lose alot of stats.....<br />
<br />
as for shoulders , I have Yttrium Studded Mantle and it is doing good for me now =)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lelith</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 01:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Like several persons who said before, get it, you will don't regret it.<br />
It's a really good item for any class really and not specially for caster ( yes it helps caster to reach the FT cap but when you are starting to kill aten, or done it a couple of time, FT is not really a problem to have and max ).</div></div><hr />
