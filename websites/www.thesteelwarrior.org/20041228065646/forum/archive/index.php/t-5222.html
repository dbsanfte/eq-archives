<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smohg</div><div class="date">01-15-2004, 06:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a two box that has all the components but when I follow the quest the way they have it written up on Allakhazam's I dont get the NPC's to co-operate.<br />
<br />
I don't mind the flames about doing the game myself and avoiding the spoiler sites but if your going to flame me can you at least give me some hints. I really am just an idiot powergamer at heart and really don't enjoy the &quot;storyline&quot; about stuff like that. <br />
<br />
If it will help I'll post a short roleplaying story.<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
Smohg entered the most holy proving grounds of the grand champion Mirthadal Marr and sighed wearily at his constant companion Budamil. <br />
<br />
&quot;I can't find the answer,&quot; Budamil said with a heavy heart.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aye, the answer was not mine to find. I was on a quest for the crystalline dragon long ago and another noble adventurer had secured passage into the lair when my rite of passage was obtained. I can't help you here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Budamil glared over the plush portion of the Plane of Valor and spit in the direction of the wastelands. He muttered a gross incantation under his breath as if asking for divine inspiration from The Tribunal. Still, no new ideas came to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;FOOLS, those fools at Allakhazam's tavern told me who to talk to and what to say to the lore gaurdians of the lair, yet still I stand here with the supposed items I was to collect and I get no answer from the custodians. What should I do Smohg?&quot;<br />
<br />
Smohg took a long drink from his canteen and spit on the ground. &quot;Tis a quandrey to be sure, but I cannot guide on your quest. I was not called and now that I've matched blades with the corrupted dragon I cannot obtain independent passage into the lair ever. I will always be guest in the dragon's lair. You walk alone.&quot;<br />
<br />
Off in the distance, Aerin Dar chuckled knowing that he was safe - for now.</div></div><hr />
