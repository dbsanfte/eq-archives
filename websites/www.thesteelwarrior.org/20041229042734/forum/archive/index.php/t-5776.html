<br />
Honest opinion?<br />
Best AA for you would be none.<br />
<br />
You really should hit 65 first.<br />
The benifites outweigh any AA.<br />
<br />
But if ye really want AA, you might want to give metabolisim a try.<br />
For the same AA cost as 2 points of stamina, you can have stat food which lasts and ungodly amount of time.</div></div><hr />

I know how it can be, we all want to burn a hole in our pocket with our banked AA's, but trust me, follow this guide and you will be happy in the long run. I made too many mistakes spending AA's early in offence AA's that suck.</div></div><hr />

Just about every roll you make involves your level vs. the mobs lvl.  You also get a nice fat HP bonus when you hit lvl 65 =).  <br />
<br />
I did regen3 also cause I'm a leezard and i like regen plus im a vain leezard.  ND3 all the way for arch, although i got CS 1 and CA 1 before I moved onto ND2 &amp; 3 cause the Physical Enchancement Class AA only boosts ND/CS/CA if you have aa's spent in them.  For class, imnsho AETaunt is the best warrior AA.  I also got PE (more hp/avoidance/mitigation),  Rampage cause it is fun as hell with an earthshaker (also nice for wacking an entire train to get on all the mobs hate lists at once... be nice to your enchanter though) and Double Riposte 2 for my class title 'cause after all... i'm a vain leezard.<br />
<br />
Most importantly.... do what is the most fun for you first.</div></div><hr />

It is the one time I would NOT advice leveling. You better have the equipment, and that is more important than being 65.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Run3<br />
Sta3<br />
ND3<br />
AE Taunt<br />
CA2<br />
CS2<br />
PE<br />
PD3<br />
CA3<br />
<br />
I think I'm going to get the 1st level of Sturdiness then:<br />
<br />
CS3<br />
LR5<br />
ID5<br />
<br />
That will have me at just under 100 points spent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Malikae</div><div class="date">02-21-2004, 11:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I went:<br />
<br />
Sta3, Run 3, then ND2, CA1, CS1, CF1 (for the hell of it), Aeara taunt, then finished off ND3, CS3 and CA3, then PE. I threw tactical mastery 1 in there somewhere when i got a few free AA's for flagging. I just polished off PD 3, next is the GoD AA for 100 hps (whatever its called), then off too LR5 and ID5. Going the defensive, HP route is the way to go. Screw the offensive until you max hps and defensive, those make life sooooo much easier. Having 8100 hps raid buffed and being able to tank PoP bosses rules. Only thing that sucks is i'm going to have over 100aa before my Marshall title.:o</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Conanix</div><div class="date">02-21-2004, 01:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did STA 2 run3 then got lvl 65 and hit ND, PD, PE, CAgility1 and then AE taunt. I did AE taunt after i maxed out my HP AA's so that when i  got AE taunt i had the HP to take the extra beating. AE Taunt worked great after killing the spider guardian. All the spiders came after me giving other tanks time to grab one and for healers to live.  Now that i have all my HP AA's im doing combat agility then the rest of my defensive AA's. Fully raid buffed i am just shy of 8K.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gront</div><div class="date">02-21-2004, 02:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not a raid tank.  Much as I'd like to be a raid tank, I don't have time to join a raiding guild.  So my AA intentions are a bit non-standard.<br />
<br />
Specifically, rather than optimizing for hit points, I'm going to optimize for mitigation.  I already have enough hit points that none of the mobs I'm facing can one-round me.  And I'd rather take less damage over time, and take it more smoothly, than have more HP to brag about.  :-)<br />
<br />
So here's what I'll be buying:<br />
<br />
CA1/CS1/ND1/PE<br />
CA2/CS2<br />
CA3/CS3<br />
LR5/ID5<br />
ND3<br />
Sturdiness 1<br />
PD3<br />
Sturdiness 2<br />
offensive AA's<br />
<br />
Basically, unless you're fighting raid mobs, even against LDoN hard you're better off mitigating more rather than having more HPs to soak unmitigated damage.<br />
<br />
And hit points are to a certain extent fungible with gear; mitigation, much less so (that is, it's easier to get 10% more HP from your gear, than to get enough AC to mitigate 10% better).<br />
<br />
*shrug* I'm a long way away from any of this, of course; three more AA, and I'll have the first line up there finished out.  But this is my plan.<br />
<br />
Take care,<br />
<br />
Gront Warrior 65<br />
Graa Beastlord 65<br />
Kheysa Meatus<br />
Ayonae Ro<br />
<br />
P.S. But I will confess that the extra 200 hit points from ND1/PE are going to feel really good to my prideful little Magelo'd soul.  :-)  I just wish I could justify buying the other 621 points of added HP, and trying to crack 6k HP unbuffed, before spending all those points on mitigation.  Ah, well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just a clarification, you will need to spend more in Arch. Perhaps you meant CA2, CS2, ND2, then PE? <br />
<br />
As for suggestions, the standard path is always going to be defensive AA all the way then offensive fun. Do whatever you would like to do. Personally, I mix in some offensive AAs in with my defensive AA, but i play the game to have fun as much as possible and only min/max it when the difference is huge.</div></div><hr />

I could get my stamina to 305 right now by spending 15aa points, but why bother?  Never know when the next stamina upgrade is going to roll down the track and make them all obsolete.<br />
<br />
Get the good shit first.  If you still have non capped stamina when you're at AA 250 or whatever, then look into stamina, otherwise it's just a lot of wasted points.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would def get ND3 before all the Defensives. I would also get AET before all the defensives. (actually I did, heh)<br />
<br />
USUALLY, unless you are mega twinked out VT+ style....you are going to need the ND3 just to do your job in any higher Planes. <br />
<br />
Even PoV with ND3 would be a lot easier.<br />
<br />
The defensive AAs are kind of a cumulative thing over time. <br />
<br />
ND3 is a lot of hps for the cost immediately.<br />
<br />
Gront man, I know that you feel comfy atm getting the defensives instead of ND3...but ND3 does not cost much, and the payback is mucho mucho.<br />
<br />
Can do it anyway you want of course, but ND3 was just way too much bang for the buck.<br />
<br />
IIRC, the last ND is approx..60+ hps per AA point. You will never get that much utility out of any of the defensive AA's for one AA.<br />
<br />
so for 2 AA's...you get 120+ hps. If you have 6k unbuffed even (Very, VERY, Impressive for someone with no ND3), that is about 2% of your hps. You would need a defensive AA for a mere 2 AA's that reduces all damage (spell too) by 2% to compare.<br />
<br />
I sure I screwed up calcs somewhere, but just trying to do some comping for you.<br />
<br />
I am really time-constrained that I need to make every AA count (110 atm) so I like to make sure I am getting bang for my buck. <br />
<br />
I have to pick-up group sometimes as well (LDON hard, Elem Planes) and having a nice round number of hps somewhere up there helps the clerics feel more confident with me. <br />
<br />
ESPECIALLY since they know I do not have uber guild gear.<br />
<br />
Just my 2 cents. <br />

<br />
Can't access Magelo at work, but there is my swag since no one else has answered your Q yet. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Prolly best and cheapest to start maxxing stuff out would be:<br />
<br />
Clattering Bone Necklace<br />
Bracers of Benevolence<br />
Grimling Contraption<br />
Mosquitio Earring / Cabbage Earring<br />
Valorium Rings / Amethyst Ring<br />
Skyshrine Gauntlet MQ<br />
LDON - Everfrost Armor<br />
Crinrose Cape of Werewolf / Cloak of Greater Pern<br />
<br />
This is all based on where your Stamina is. If it is close to maxxed, you need more difficult to obtain (usually) pure hp items. <br />
<br />
If it is not close, you have all kinds of stamina related items that can help you get to 280 Stamina - 50 or 60 for buffs.<br />
<br />
All of the items above are nice and cheap (a bunch of their hps come from stamina bumps)<br />
<br />
If you worship Rallos Zek or Tribunal(barbarian), then Fierce Heraldic or Tribunal Armor will give you good AC and lots of pure hps.<br />

After our top warrior was duel wielding dagarn's tail(with anger II) with CHOS in off hand. We managed to pick up this beauty, he slapped an anger III on it as well.<br />

<br />
It's significantly less DPS (and melee-damage-hate) than a GSot4W, which should be trivial for your guild to acquire.  It's effectively the same DPS as the GSoT, and worse melee-damage-hate; and the GSoT's stun-plus-dd proc is dramatically better for hate than Gaudralek's dd-only proc.<br />
<br />
A case can be made that the 40 AC and 15 HP make it a better tanking weapon than the GSoT (or 50 AC more and 25 HP less than the GSot4W), but I'd argue that the significantly greater delay and weaker aggro make it too much less effective for holding the mob on the MT.<br />
<br />
Any particular reason why your guild hasn't obtained a GSot4W for your MT to put that Anger III into?<br />

If you put anger into a great dps weapon but decent aggro weapon, you get a decent aggro weapon and lose your low aggro dps weapon.<br />

Long story short:  Anger aug gaudralek, keep gso4w (which you should get anyway, by the by) for non tanking dps.</div></div><hr />
