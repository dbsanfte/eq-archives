<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nayl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Rather unexpectedly, I find myself wielding a DBotW, after the only other warrior interested passed on it yesterday.<br />
<br />
My current options for an offhander include Bloodfrenzy and Stone Etched Mallet.  I'm planning on going with BF on raids, and SEM for exp groups.  <br />
<br />
My question is, is there a better offhander for aggro purposes?  EoE looks good, but is it actually superior, given that BF procs twice as often?<br />
<br />
Any and all advice welcome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">im nowhere close to time but im pretty sure than DBotW with anger 3 and WA5 would be enough aggro as is. with that i think that the much better stats on the EoE would be more of a benefit than the extra, if any, aggro coming off the offhanded bloodfrenzy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Valnir Lanys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">EoE is a great offhander but if you already have SEM theres not a whole lot of offhands that are going to out dps it.  I'ed personally consider the Rathe 1hs as offhand if it comes your way otherwise just save for hammer of the timeweaver.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kilaxin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you have WA5 i'd recommend looking into an Ethereal Destroyer.. 750 proc is $$$... however given the shitty ratio it might not be such a wonderful upgrade. I'm not sure if anyone's parsed it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Regardless tho, The hammer from Quarm would be your best bet for the future.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Niafix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">ED is a dumb offhand for a dbotw. Bloodfrenzy is great for agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Timmok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I would stick with the BF for now and save your DKP/merit for now.<br />
<br />
Once you reach ikkinz raid trials, you can then replace BF with Jagged Onyx Staff for extra dps/decent stats and decent agro(although lower than BF I would think).<br />
<br />
Personally I'm offhanding an EoE atm and thats a nice weapon too. I thought about upgrading to the onyx staff, but its too small an upgrade imo to be worth the DKP cost. Plus I would have to go farm LDON for points for another anger3 aug. <br />
<br />
So sticking with EoE until I see any major weapons upgrade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Apocaly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Jagged Onyx Staff in offhand unless your guild isn't doing any Kod'taz trials.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Derrict</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">SEM rune proc could cause some buff stacking problems during raids, especially ones where resist buffs are needed or the mob will do several AEs.  If you have 14 buffs and leave one open for a mgb or DoT heal and the SEM procs, mob hasn't hit you yet and an mgb goes off, it won't land on you.  SEM might be fine for exp groups where you'll have more open buffs, but think about getting another offhand (ie EoE) if you want to upgrade you BF.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Bloodfrenzy is still great for agro; I would use it until you can pick up an EoE, or something you would like more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shaiel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Stick with the BF until a weapon worth the upgrade comes by.  Darkblade/Bloodfrenzy is probably THE best aggro combo; even better than EoE offhand.  Getting a new weapon for a small increase in offhand weapon DPS isn't worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Morticea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I use EoE with my DbotW.<br />
<br />
I got Anger III aug for DbotW yesterday, I only have WA3, but I do have RZ BP (with the built in Aggro mulitplier) and am finding that I hold pretty good aggro.<br />
<br />
I havn't decided what Aug to put in EoE yet.</div></div><hr />
