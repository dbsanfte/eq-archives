<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Timrum</div><div class="date">06-23-2003, 05:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all <br />
<br />
Ok my first problem ist that i dint played for the last 6 months - so most of my friends are a few levels higher than me - but that should be no real big problem. <br />
<br />
I want to ask what mobs / quest we can do for exp and better equipmet for me. Dont understand me wrong my equipment isnt bad for my level ( i think :) ) but we want to do somthing intresting and hunting in the same zone for days only for exp is boring. <br />
 So look at my magelo - find a bad thing - and give me a hint where i can find a better  :) <br />
<br />
Normaly i can get without any problem the following chars. <br />
<br />
War Lev: 52 --&gt; me  magelo (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=356370)<br />
<br />
Beaslord Lev:65 ~200AA  // Wizzy Lev:55  --&gt; both played by one person ( at the same time -2Accounts/2 PC´s)<br />
<br />
Shammy Lev: 54 <br />
<br />
Rouge Lev:65 ~60AA  <br />
<br />
Enchanter Lev: 65 ~100AA <br />
<br />
Cleric Lev: 58 <br />
<br />
Necro Lev: 55<br />
<br />
Note that the Rouge and the Necro are also the same person (also 2 Acc and 2 Pc´s), and the Enchanter and the Cleric ar not online very much atm ( the play SB) but we can get ther chars if we need it. ( Normaly the Rouge playe the Enchanter or Cerlic on his 2nd Pc -if we need one of them)<br />
<br />
So i think with that groupe we can get some quest or mobs done that drop some usefull parts for me ( or the shammy :) )<br />
<br />
i hope thats was not to confusing :)</div></div><hr />

Arms, Legs, Boots, Cobalt Bracer.. get rid of em, Buy SS MQ/Thurg MQ for those slots, or just buy some cultural armor since you could just resell em when ya upgrade. Save your Lodi Shield for your resist gear and get a decent hp cloak. Maels, Heiro, Pernic, somethin.. other than that if i was you at 52.. i would be happy :p thats very decent gear for a lv52. <br />
<br />
ah.. Quests = Bracer of Benev, Eyepatch of Plunder, Draconic Pauldrons etc etc. All good upgrades. Search out some quests, you'll be bound to find some decent ones that fit in with your playstyle. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wompem Ondahed</div><div class="date">06-23-2003, 09:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">KEEP the cobalt bracer! Never ever ever get rid of it. Bag it when you upgrade, but always remember OS doesn't like to drop these.<br />
<br />
Other than that, everyone has solid advice. Your group of friends can easily do the Plate House in Thurg, just read up on it. If you don't want to wear the Thurg, then sell those as MQ and buy some SS mq's, then you are set.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ealsur Helevorn</div><div class="date">06-24-2003, 01:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hahaha Im with Smakz... how are we supposed to look at that magelo? :p <br />
<br />
Anyway, Draconic shoulders are easy (if your CoV faction is good), Eyepatch of Plunder can be a loooong camp, unless you are lucky and find Stormfeather up and the zone empty, like I did :p<br />
You can try the bracer of benevolence, with that group of ppl, the giant should not be a problem. Neither should be the Icehouse in Kael :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Camp the goranga tree and goranga scouts in ME.  Stone visor for you when the goranga seer pops, nice range item for your caster friends when the goranga chieftain pops (both may be semi-rare drops from semi-rare pops though).<br />
<br />
Take the crew to CT and get yourself the mosquito earring, try for boots of flowing slime for your caster friends.</div></div><hr />
