<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Duke73</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Personally I don't care for all the complicated aggro fixes and since aggro lock for Pally's is so easy why can't it be for us?<br />
<br />
My suggestion:  Add hate to every hit a warrior lands, maybe 15-25.  We are the masters of armed combat, so we should know those aggravating spots on a mob in which to piss it off.  So more hits = more aggro, and duel wield once again becomes THE choice for MA warriors, while SA warriors can just pull out their slow 2handers like the old days to avoid aggro.<br />
<br />
If someones already suggested this sorry for wasting your time :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Caeden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sometimes the simple answers are the best ones :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Duke73</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I guess it has been suggested as it's no.5 on Raaj's poll :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Caeden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">yea, lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Erm...<br />
wouldn't it be better to just up Warrior's dps as a whole?<br />
<br />
You hit for more = more aggro.<br />
<br />
Our advantage IS suppose to be damage isnt it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Not really. Our original design was to be able to take the hits better, which was the reason for our mediocre DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Wilhelmm_Lanys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Upgrading a warrior's DPS to fix our taunt skill would require MUCH higher dps, which would lead to an out-slaught of monk.rogue complaints (justified complaints mind you).<br />
<br />
I think the answer is; make EB a 30-sec reusable innate skill. Then, change the current proc on EB weapons to something of similar levels of agro; 250 DD + stun unresistable, which may net a bit less agro but it should suffice with the damage component.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>GorfinML</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">skills, discs, weapons or procs arent the answer to warrior's aggro. those are just temporary fixes, ie: the taunt button(but i dont want the taunt button to leave...its our only hope of snap aggro)<br />
<br />
i think the +hate per hit is the best idea.  it gives us war's the ability to get and hold aggro better, while not nerfing pala's and sk's...its an increase in aggro while not increasing out DPS/mitigation/aviodance.<br />
<br />
its also gonna make it so other similary equip'd war's will need to watch their aggro, just as some other classes must.<br />
<br />
*keep in mind, this is comming from a 64war, that isnt anywhere near the end-game of any expansion, just casual grouping*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It would also scale very well with the low damage 1hs that most MTs use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Eoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">How about just adding an amount of hate to every taunt, successful and failed.  An amount = to taunt skill or 1.5x taunt skill would probably be about right.<br />
<br />
Successful taunt puts warrior at top of hatelist + x(taunt skill) agro<br />
Failed taunt adds x(taunt skill) agro<br />
<br />
-Warrior pulls mob, starts beating it<br />
-Slower casts slow<br />
-Mob turns to eat slower<br />
-Warrior taunts, fails but still gets a bonus +220hate from the failed taunt which could be enough to pull the mob back to him within 6 seconds when added to melee damage for that period of time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">That at least keeps a mob from ping-ponging when you have two similarly equipped warriors in the same group.  That'll get a slower eaten in a hurry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">This works but I've never liked tying agro to DPS for one simple reason: It works like procs.  You get agro when you don't want too.  You don't get agro when you really need too.<br />
<br />
If you overly tie agro to DPS you only want the Warrior with the most DPS tanking reguardless of skill level or fielding choice (maybe that Warrior doesn't feel like tanking).  Any other Warrior is less than desirable.  What do your other Warriors do during situations where you want to deal the most damage as possible but not tank?  Purposely cripple their DPS?  This seems counter productive.<br />
<br />
This isn't a bad idea but is inflexible when its passive(on all of the time).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Refer to Eoden's post right above mine. That's a much better idea than aggro-by-damage, imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>GorfinML</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">i'm talking about adding hate based on lvl, not based damage or dps<br />
<br />
ie: war1 is 65 and using 2 rusty shortswords...each hit adds +hate of 5%(ie: each hit normally is 20hate, its now 21hate[20 + 5% = 21])<br />
<br />
war 2 is using 2 time 1h's...each swing still adds 5% hate at lvl 65(each swing normaly adds 200hate, now adds 210 hate<br />
<br />
war 3 is using the same time 1h's but is only lvl 60..each swing adds 3% hate..so its 206hate/hit now<br />
<br />
*disclamer* the numbers dont me jack, i made them up to give a visual<br />
<br />
*edit* well, its kinda based on damage..the more damgae you do, the more hate you generate...but the %'s are based on levels at least lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Valeris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Personally am in agreement with Aeka - plus a Passive ability is less noticeable and doesn't clue the group in to your contribution...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">We are the master of combat, we fight best!<br />
Meaning we should dish in some massive dps.<br />
<br />
Rogues and Monks won't whine because they are also in deep need of a DPS upgrade.<br />
<br />
Good thing about making DPS higher :<br />
<br />
°a pretty constant aggro, rivaled by monks and rogues, but both have means of escaping the aggro very nicely.<br />
<br />
°a nice utility in groups, dps.... while knights may make others kill the mob faster, we kill it faster on our own, compensating.<br />
<br />
°DPS related aggro won't imbalance knight/warrior, because they still have a very nice advantage - distance aggro.<br />
<br />
°Different weapons will now become more attractive, because for a warrior, the dps will finally matter.<br />
<br />
°Enraging Blow type procs will still matter for tanking warriors to keep aggro away from non tanking warriors(who will have switched to non-EB damage weapons)<br />
<br />
°Our Class description will be finally justified. We are Masters of Combat, we HURT.<br />
<br />
<br />
Bad side about making DPS higher:<br />
°My Aegis of Earth is going to suck!!! wahhh<br />
<br />
<br />
Atm, the relation between dps is more or less like this:<br />
<br />
Knights-1, Warrior-1.5, Monks-3, Rogues-4<br />
<br />
Imo, it should be like this:<br />
<br />
Knights-2, Warrior-4(5 when tanking), Monk-5.5, Rogue-7<br />
<br />
This is all modified by what weapons who uses etc...<br />
but in average, thats the way it should be imo.<br />
ps. maybe tweak the differences between warrior and monk a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">5x damage of a knight? Thou art trippin', sir.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Duke73</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Adding hate to taunt would just mean every MA war would mash taunt endlessly, there would be no point to saving it for the when it's needed, you'd just mash it to build up as much hate as you can in any given fight.<br />
Upping our dps to that of monks or rogues will simply never happen, hell would freeze over before Sony even considered that.<br />
<br />
Having a set amount of hate to every hit just makes the most sense to me, regardless of whether you hit with 1h or 2h, and wam, duel wield gets fixed in the process.<br />
<br />
But having no faith in sony, I'm sure this would never get implemented, they'd rather flood the market with nice dps stun proccing 1handers and make them useable by most melee so that casters aren't our only major problem with aggro, but other melee as well who in a month or so will see the 12/19 and 13/20's selling for dirt cheap.  If you thought these weapons were an aggro boost, they are, but only for now since warrior's are the only ones willing to spend 20-40k on these, give it a little time and the other useable classes will be more than happy to shell out 1k for a 12/19 or 13/20, regardless of the proc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Sivok Kovis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I like adding hate to taunt, but give it a longer reuse time as a tade off, say 10 times as long on refresh. Or longer depending on hate added to skill.<br />
<br />
Would be nice if we could go zerker earlier too. Maybe just 10%  earlier.<br />
<br />
We are not the best fighters, we are the best at taking a hit, we are in your face, bold and fearless. A warrior by trade is not exactly a trained armsman. He is more of a pick up as he goes type of guy, which means he learned by getting his ass kicked alot. There fore he can now take a hit and fights pretty good :P<br />
<br />
Too much thought into it i know :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Increasing the refresh on taunt would be a death sentence for slowers, regardless of +hate on success or failure. Especially if you make the refresh time 10 times longer. That's a 60-second refresh! :eek:<br />
<br />
Warriors are not necessarily &quot;pick it up as you go along&quot; types. If we did just learn things on the fly, why would we have to keep going back to our trainer every few levels to learn a new skill? :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Sivok Kovis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Because EQ screwed the whole roleplaying thing up from the get go :p <br />
<br />
And it was said in another post to have a hate increase but not one that could just be pounded on constantly. This would be it, yes 60 sec is too long, maybe a 15-20 sec refresh. Putting a little thought into playing our class wouldnt kill us :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Menon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Adding hate to taunt button is bad.  It then becomes another button to mindlessly mash.<br />
<br />
Adding hate to each hit is not the answer.  A gradual build-up of aggro is useless for keeping aggro off the slower at the beginning of a fight.  And that is what makes a knight the more efficient tank - being able to grab aggro on inc, so the mob can be slowed immediately without fear.<br />
<br />
Increasing DPS, while a good idea for warrior balance, again does not help with the core problem: aggro at the beginning of a fight when slow is cast.<br />
<br />
I still haven't seen anything better than the idea of a timed ability that gives warriors a fixed amount of hate.  Enough to get warriors over the 'slow' hump at the beginning of a fight, or saved for use after a successful taunt to prevent ping-pong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Gunrack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">spank me and call me suzie but I still haven't seen an idea as good as Furor's, it has good mechanics, it involves skill and it could have a downside.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">a part from the fact that Furor's skill doesnt fix us at all?...<br />
<br />
an Aggro dot is just like +hate on each hit... helps with aggro on the long run (which isnt that much a problem atm anyhow),<br />
but doesnt give us anything to get aggro early on.<br />
<br />
Sure, allows you to possibly tank multiple mobs at once... but whos going to do that with the damage they dish out now, or with the enchanters you got in group, or with the monks pulling?.....<br />
<br />
<br />
Although DPS will keep that starting aggro problem...<br />
it's a nice fix because it gives a REASON to pick a warrior over a knight.<br />
more dps.... that is... a difference in dps that would actually MATTER.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Mathas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Imo, it should be like this:<br />
<br />
Knights-1, Warrior-3.5(5 when tanking), Monk-5.5, Rogue-7<br />
Is that your idea for what you think they should do now, or how you wish it had been all along?  My reply would be different depending on what you mean :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Gyrfalcon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Posted this over on PoN when they asked for warrior input. They really haven't responded to the thread yet, probably still in shock that every post didn't say NERF PALLIES LOL<br />
<br />
OK, I've posted a couple of times on the SW site. I had an epiphany last night. How about an ability/skill/discipline (however it comes) that a warrior could turn on and off? Call it a nastier fighting technique (which paladins would refrain from using) where his objective is to cause more pain than damage by hitting the mob in more sensitive areas, thus getting the mobs attention? It would effectively halve the warriors damage and would drain double the normal amount of stamina while it is on (and would turn off if there is no stamina left), but double the hate generated with each blow (or add a fixed +hate amount), or it would allow for the warrior to generate procs equivalent to an Enraging Blow with whatever weapon(s) they are using (or if they are using EB weapons, it would add an extra chance for an EB proc). Turning it on or off would allow the warrior to control when he is generating agro, and halving melee dps and doubling stamina drain while it is on would reflect the amount of focus a warrior is spending on causing more pain than damage. To make this less than overpowering, make certain mobs immune to this effect so a warrior has to rely on normal agro generation techniques so as not to trivialize the raiding portion of the game.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Just wanted to add, if this will be disc based, the reuse timer is only a trivial count (like 6 seconds) and use length is stamina dependent, but if any other disc is used (ie, defensive) then this fighting style cannot be used again until the timer is up and a new disc can be used.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Gnaus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">The Taunt aggro or dmg aggro improvement are not the solution i think. the problem as some said here is to be able to control it when we want. we see in fights that a warrior can keep aggro in a fight if we let him the time to build it, the ping pong after that is also the problem to the others classes who have to be carefull of that (a wiz who chain nuke is a stupid one. but if he concussion he think a bit :)) The real problem is that a warrior CAN'T decide to aggro at a time. Like palys can save someone with a stun and then turn aggro on him at the moment he choose, warriors need something not similar (we don't want to be palys) but that can give us some control. Adding aggro on each hit won't bring that. it will just make us more aggro in the average, not being abble to decide anything then no improvement in any tactical fight. the best idea i have seen atm is the &quot;juice&quot; idea but it's not in this section, the second one (that can be a real solution but a little improvement) is the SelfRecheargeble items you can use to get aggro when you want it.<br />
As the warriors are the weapons masters i'm very interesting on the things talking about increasing aggro with specials hits (in locations like eyes, neck or whatever) that don't improve the damage but the aggro itself we are not only stupid meat, we must be considered as kings of melee in the art of figting.<br />
<br />
I think we won't have all we want from sony, EQ is close to the end for them, they more think about EQ II and how to make us go in it then we can ask for things that will change too much things.<br />
<br />
Well i will continue reading the ideas. good work all i'm sure we will win !<br />
