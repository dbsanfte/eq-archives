<br />
For example, when I see a proc 'increases aggression by 250' what does that mean?<br />
<br />
How much aggression does a 5000 point nuke by a wizard do?<br />
<br />
How much does a 7000 point heal from a cleric do?<br />
<br />
How much does a 75% magic based shaman slow do?<br />
<br />
Is there a link somewhere that explains it all and how different things get weighted?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Poosha</div><div class="date">02-13-2004, 04:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As far as I know, there's no easy way to work out the aggro generated by nukes, heals, or stuns.  The *simplest* way would be to have two characters: a Shadowknight (who has a fixed-aggro spell) and one of the classes you mention.  You'd get the wizard/cleric/shaman to cast one or more of their spells, and then see how many casts of the shadowknight spell would be required to gain aggro... this would give you a rough estimate of aggro per spell cast.<br />
<br />
However, it's my understanding that there's a problem with doing this.  Apparently the Shadowknight spell does little-to-nothing to a mob that hasn't been engaged by the Shadowknight already, meaning that he would have to attack the mob and then do his casting which would throw off the results a bit.<br />
<br />
Take this with a grain of salt, though... I haven't done the tests myself, nor do I even have access to the right toons to test this.  This is all just compiled ideas from reading this board and those of other classes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So let me rephrase... the sword I am using now (see magelo) that adds 250 anger, according to Lucy... is good or not so good? <br />
<br />
Would it help more or less than a 325 dd proc from, from say the delightfull orb?<br />
<br />
<br />
In fact, please look at my magelo and tell me what weapon you think will be a better hate-inducer, the orb (in my inventory, since the level 55 proc nerf I am not using it till 55) when I am 55+, or the Hooked So'Shar?<br />
