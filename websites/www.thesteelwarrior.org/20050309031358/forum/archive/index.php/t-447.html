Way to go on the Elemental miniboss upgrades. Why not just make their AE zonewide and make em quad for 10k? That could be challenging too ya know. Id like to know who the masochistic retard is that said &quot;hey, im not having fun fighting mobs that hit for nearly 2k and flurry AND have 2k AEs!&quot; Funny thing is, its probably some bastage that already HAS elemental armor. Well no wonder the mobs are easy, dorkboy! Go get yer ass into PoTime and leave stuff alone damnit!<br />
<br />
You want a really good challenge? Try playing EQ with your feet. Or let your dog roll up a character for you using only his nose, then try playing it. If EQ isnt a challenge for you, then stop playing it, or do something to make it such. Nooo they have to tell Verant that the game just isnt fun since others can now access the same stuff! Thanks...dorktard.<br />
<br />
PoWater is already THE dumbest zone in the game, now it sinks way beyond dumb. It had surpassed idiotic and delved far beyond retarded now. It has reached an all new low of wasted space. You wanna upgrade your stupid little minibosses? Fine...be sure to fix your lame ass geometry then. Work on how fighting in water is handled while youre at it. A mob goes inside a wall, try to pull it out and get summoned inside the geometry...then you appear at trhe zone in! What a brilliant idea. Instead of just making the zone walls actually existant, lets put in something that can screw up an encounter even more! <br />
<br />
It wasnt so bad that AEs went through terrain. That wasnt an issue..but now...pffft. Now we got MINI, notice the emphasis, minibosses that have 300 range AEs and have -400 resistant checks?? WTF?? Again...thanks.<br />
<br />
Personally, I couldnt give a rats fuzzy testicle if Furor is bored, or if Zaar thinks hes just too badass for EQ. This is a game. Its supposed to be fun. Not just for one person, or one guild. In a game like this there should be rewards for the work put in. Dealing with the PoP flags, the minibosses, the gods, the entire convoluted mess that is PoP... wheres the reward? It was in killing elemental minis and gods, collecting the best stuff in the game because you WORKED your asses off getting there. Whered that idea go actually? Suddenly the game got harder because...why? Because it seems to be too easy for like 3 or 4 guilds gamewide? Once again those who used their brains and thought up tactics and strategies to fight mobs are punished in favor of zerging... all for the sake of challenge.<br />
<br />
Again Verant/SoE. Thanks, my interest in your game just dropped 60% in the last 2 days. WTG!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
You know that stone on the far left.... the one that was SUPPOSED to be the Plane of War...where the Rallos event SHOULD be... well thanks to them not working out the kinks on the script and just putting it in Tactics... LAZY. Instead they did a ruch job and put him in Tactics, and made it so you have to warn the zone, and get all those not in the raid OUT so you can do the event right. Now that just sucks. Sorry xp groups, sorry soloers... but you gotta go so we can wipe a few times, or MAYBE get flagged for elemental planes, wish us luck! BAH!<br />
<br />
Just my two hatefull cp.</div></div><hr />
