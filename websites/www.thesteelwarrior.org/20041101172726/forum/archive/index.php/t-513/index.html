<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>gwarf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Alright, well before everyone rolls their eyes, so far i have been hella disappointed with PoP<br />
<br />
That stuff about PoP adding new zones to go to is not too true. The spiders in PON con YELLOW to me at 52???<br />
<br />
Plane of Innovation was WHITE to me at the entrance.<br />
<br />
Here is my problem. I two box my wife's cleric (53) and she plays a chanter (almost 51).<br />
<br />
We cant find a single uncamped place to go and get xp. <br />
<br />
Our server is very crowded, so when we get home from work you can forget velks, forget seb, froget POJ --&gt; those prisoners are camped to hell. <br />
<br />
I think part of the problem is that instead of shouting for groups, we are BYOG, and therefore its hard to get a camp spot. <br />
<br />
Karnors = camped<br />
<br />
The Grey = takes too long to kill the mobs for the xp payoff, and that timeless golem stun proc just sucks.<br />
<br />
City of Mist =  some small guild guild is always there in a group of 6 owning the whole zone.<br />
<br />
WHERE can we go? I am about to just quit this game its way too crowded. If aynone has any tips for us please either send my a PM (if you dont want to give away a favorite spot) or just reply here and rip me or what not for being a whiner. BUt any tips are welcome<br />
<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jedediah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Don't know what server you're on, but on RN, karnor's and similar zones are pretty empty.  With the characters you have available, I'd recommend you check out Howling Stones, Chardok, Fungus Grove, and the Hole though, if Seb, KC, and Velk are too busy.  For the Hole and HS, I'd pick up a druid or wizard for evacs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bonehammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Might try:<br />
<br />
Sanctus Seru, look at the map<br />
<br />
1. Main hallway guards are okay, or<br />
2. Zone in, invis up, and go to end of main hall.  On either side there is a clickable port up to a large hallway.  Mobs there are decent and its incredibly easy.  Some are paladins though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hyardgune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Tenebrous at the Vamp Hotel.  Maiden's Eye.  Akheva entrance.  Acrylia.  Maybe some in Umbral but the fights would take all year with that group.<br />
<br />
I dunno about your server but I was in KC last night helping a friend with VSR and the place was a ghost town.  There was us, another guild trying to jump us and that was about it.  Back before PoP, by 8 or 9pm ET KC was wall-to-wall people.<br />
<br />
PoN is the new DL, just deal with this.<br />
<br />
Maybe find a few other folks and go deeper into PoI.  Or try PoD, it is a pretty big zone, you can probably find a few things that you can kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Hulanta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Get a porter and go to the Hole.  If the entrance is camped, you can go deep into the Hole and find all kinds of good places to fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>DinadassDegladi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Chardok as long as your wife could mez the IZ/ent fort stuff and OZ would be very doable and easy. You would just get double pulls until you had it broken, think you need to be 54+ to single pull the IZ and lvl 60 to level pull the fort.<br />
<br />
Another camped spot but you could probably get the SS tower 5 spawn would be CS if you are non kos to CoV wvyerns are pathetically easy, just sometimes alot of quad-kiters.  blue con mobs that don't hurt faction and don't assist each other = exp goldmine.<br />
<br />
Another place would be the ent to the hole, great exp modifier and alot of fun. just buy a snare whip or root park the mobs when they go to run.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>moglar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Have you tried Dulak?  The caves should be right for you're level.  Also there's crypt of nadox, but that might be a little tough.  Amen to the hole, that place is great for a group like the one you've described just right at the entrance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>gwarf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">thanks guys i will print this out and take it home to show her</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">PoP was not made for level 50's my friend.  There is PLENTY of content for level 50's.  <br />
<br />
Go to neriak 3rd gate.  Run all the way to the back.  Find a couple wizard NPC's that con blue, and beat the living snot out of them.  Then pull the guard near them, then grab the necro in a building across the bridge from a guard.  Thank me when you're 55 in a couple weeks time</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>gwarf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">at level 52 i can take those?<br />
<br />
Wont everyone in the zone agro and nuke the hell out of me?<br />
<br />
hmm i will have to explore this option<br />
<br />
you mean all the way in the back by the water on those wooden catwalks?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Splaktar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">You must be on a newer server, because on Fennin Ro, all those zones are basically empty and unused.... just a waste of space...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Chardok and the Hole. two of my favorite exp spots that are always forgotten and usually empty besides a raid or maybe a duo at the ent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gnomb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Chardok all the way.<br />
I entered it at level 53 and left at level 60 going from duoing at entrance to taking groups down to mines.<br />
Best group ever managed to go to mines and even clear herbalist with me pulling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>gwarf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">yeah chardok is camped to hell on my server by 6pm CST<br />
<br />
that ruled out. Plus im BYOG (bring your own group) and its impossible to find a spot to setup that isnt taken.<br />
<br />
Thats why i was asking for the unusual or known empty spots.<br />
<br />
We have a 51 chanter and a botted 53 cleric. <br />
<br />
Right now TImorous Deep Spriocs have been our best XP from 45 to 53. Chain pulling two or three at a time and stun/root parking I reached a level every other night until level 52.<br />
<br />
I cleared 51 in two sessions of non stop pulling.<br />
<br />
Hole is always camped, we would have to move further in as a trio to get a camp spot.<br />
<br />
Dulak...camped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Jedediah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I'm still baffled...what server are you on that has these zones camped?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Bumamgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Also, your making your own problem worse by refusing to take outsiders.<br />
<br />
Ditch the &quot;botted&quot; cleric, and you and your wife join some pickup groups.  Or keep the cleric, and invite 3 others to join your &quot;Elite&quot; club.<br />
<br />
I don't have much sympathy for someone complaining about no place to hunt when you are the one making it hard on yourself.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Put the jealousy down dude.  Not everyone has to turn to pickup groups to get XP, and not everyone wants to.  I had enough of pickup groups in the first 3 months I owned EQ, and never looked back.  If you don't have to rely on someone else who may end up ruining your playtime for that day/evening, you're better off.  Some people figured this out a long time ago and refuse to participate in that system.  That doesn't make them &quot;elite,&quot; it makes them people who don't want to spend their 13 bucks that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>gwarf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Heh<br />
<br />
No biggie everyone. We dont try to make an elite club, and by far i hate botting the cleric. We always try to shout first, ask questions later. But its just hard to get her and I into a group, and since we love playing together, i really dont want to have her be left out or her have me left out. It is harder than you think to just &quot;shout&quot; for groups and get both of us in, especially at the young ages of 52 and 51st level.<br />
<br />
And when we do, no offense, we find ourselves in really bad pick up groups that some druid is starting because he couldnt get a group. Case in point, it seems whenever I ditch the bot cleric, we die plain and simple, because it seems that alot of people dont know how to play their classes properly<br />
<br />
In Karnors one night, I joined a group and patiently waited for cleric buffs. I had camped her cleric, I was the main tank. <br />
<br />
The new &quot;cleric&quot; in our group was only 47. We had her chantner (then 50) and a rogue. We were lied to and told the group had more, and one guy left when we joined (the druid)<br />
<br />
I waited and got no buffs, NONE. I had to give him 23 plat for a symbol buff.<br />
<br />
THAT is why I dont like to ditch the bot cleric. Sometimes we are surprised and we meet some good players, but nowadays with the way EQ has been dumbed down, this is far and few between<br />
<br />
Like for example the ANON level 42 warrior that joined our Karnors group later that night<br />
<br />
or the druid that dotted mezzed adds<br />
<br />
I only ask because if we could, we would love to find a camp spot and invite people, and we did do that in Plane of Justice. I then tell anyone that joins that the cleric is botted, so they know what is up. If another cleric is shouting for group, we camp the bot and ask the cleric to join. Trust me I dont like botting that much. It keeps me from chatting really, takes alot of concentration and is stressfull, so if we start a group and see another healer LFG, I snatch them up fast.<br />
<br />
So by all means, we are not snobby. We are however finding each spot camped CHOCK full of groups by the time we log in after work. <br />
<br />
I have a good idea of where I will go next for XP and all the tips have been helpful, thanks alot!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">For every one pickup group I've been in where everyone know how to play their class well, knew how to mesh their skills to complement the rest of the classes present, and knew how to manage aggro, I've been in three that did not know how to do those things and ended up losing more xps than I gained.  I hate pickup groups, because you never know who got their account on ebay. (don't know until it's too late anyway)  :p<br />
<br />
Beo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Elroy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Tower of the Frozen Shadow.<br />
<br />
<br />
With that group,<br />
<br />
Goto Allak and read up on which mobs drop which keys.<br />
Fight your way up to the top floor of ToFS.  The first 2-3 floors will be green to light blue. (sorry but its a key zone)<br />
you should start to see some more blues around 4th floor, after 4-5th floor they will all be blue to you.  <br />
Heck with the cleric, stay on the undead floor and clean house.<br />
<br />
If you are happy with the exp stay on the 6th a or b floors, but i would recommend that you get to the top floor and have a Hey day.<br />
Most of the Mobs dont run, they dont hit to hard, they are crowded and will agro, but with the wife for Crowd control you'll be set.<br />
set em up and knock em down.<br />
Just dont try to take on the bats that may spawn Tserrina with that group..You WILL be toast. She will mez the You(the warrior) and then you watch helplessly as you kill your 2box, then your wife.  Then you will zone back in only to be summoned back up to her to be killed again. etc etc. (little personal experience for ya)<br />
<br />
If your Lucky someone will come up help you take her out<br />
if your REAL lucky a high lvl group who is praying for her robe to drop will let you loot her master Key.<br />
thats your goal... get the master key so you can just zoom right on up. you only need one key per group. <br />
The top floor will keep you in decent exp (not as great PoP) they should start turning light blue around 55.  Then you can go back to lvl 6b and kill bats, and the named maybe try to take out Tserrina then. <br />
Respawn rates are about 10-15 minutes. <br />
I went from 49-53 there on top floor then moved to the older zones that are now vacant.  Seb, chardok, etc are baren most of the time on CT.<br />
<br />
You may run into some crowds on the lower floors...but for the most there should not be many (if any) in zone especially on the 4-6th floors.  Peops may camp the wedding area. but theres plenty of Mobs around.<br />
<br />
ToFS is a one of the best designed and thought out zone IMHO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>moglar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">The best groups I've been in with strangers have either been groups I've made myself.  Ain't nothing wrong with leaving the cleric bot in the group if you ask me.  I wouldn't even feel the need to inform the other group members (unless I wound up finding out they actually knew what they were doing &amp; they were cool people).<br />
<br />
When I make a group, I make sure instructions are very clear and if people disregard the instructions (badly) or don't provide a noticeable contribution, I have no quams about disbanding them.<br />
<br />
&quot;sorry mister xyz, but I dont like the way you play and I'm disbanding you.  Best of luck to you on you're future endeavors&quot;<br />
<br />
Even though, I'm not mean about it, some people remaining in the group may become offended, in which case I disband them to and keep on looking until I find the right mix of the right people.<br />
<br />
Ofcourse, I never make a group unless I'm going to be playing in the specified area for more than 3 hours (minimum).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Strikingone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I hate that you can't see what you do when charmed now. /sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>DinadassDegladi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">qwarf what server is this crowded? please inform us, all quite curious</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Meety Da'Shield</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Well,... <br />
<br />
Don't quit the game dude just move to another server. Maybe a Newbie one or a new are one like the European or U.S or whatever or find a newer server all the old school servers are camped and every character you'll group with if yah make new chars will be as powerful as a lvl 10 at lvl 1 with all their twink gear.<br />
<br />
What Server you play on and i agree with everyone The Hole is great XP noone usually camping anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>gwarf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">sorry Im on Povar i forgot to mention that like each time ROFL<br />
<br />
Povar is hugely crowded, no one under 50 groups, they all just PL to get to 45+ really. The Hole i need to check more but usually its camped at the entrance. We could move in further I guess, was just wary about it. We will keep plugging away, no one eer said it would be easy thats for sure</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Gnomb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Best tip i can give you is to use the LFG tool to fill up your group.<br />
With your setup you are all but open who to take in.<br />
<br />
Good places to try would be also Acrylia Caverns, Akheva Ruins, Scarlet Desert, Katta and Tenebrous Mountains.<br />
Never hunted there myself at the low 50s but a lot of my guildies did.<br />
I did 49-55 mostly in OOT (seafuries, nice cash, lousy exp), CoM (stables and temple area (dinged 55 at temple) and from 53 to 60 with guild groups in Chardok, although i wouldnt recommend it before 53 or 54 unless you sit only at entrance/exit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Sturgis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">all the old school servers are camped  <br />
<br />
Actually, the oldest servers would have the least crowding in all the old world zones. Most of those zones are pretty empty on E'ci (one of the original servers), because everyone and their brother has a 60+ main (and probably some 50-60+ twinks).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>wold</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">YOu can easily fight in PoD with that group. The trick is your cleric has to learn how to use pacify. Then you can single pull tetse and vetri flies, believe me, you will get amazing experience. You have to be careful about picking your fighting site to avoid trains/adds. But it can be done at those levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Sterix_VA</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Chardok!<br />
Me and most of our guild has done majority of our exp grinds before PoP in Chardok. And even after PoP.<br />
<br />
At early 50s, zone in and zone out are great exp spots. Just keep some invising means with you, only rare occasion a sniffer sees through invis and you will have to walk through some caves to zone out.<br />
<br />
With better group, or higher level, fort/pits will become great camps. Fort can be single pulled at 58 I think, pits around same level. Otherwise especially fort might create too many adds without CC (root works ok though)<br />
<br />
Chardok is great exp even at 60 and higher, going deeper to camps like Graveyard or Bank or Herb Hut.<br />
<br />
Best part of the Chardok is that it is most of the time totally empty. Zone in, Zone out and Pits are sometimes camped, but camps deeper in are always free.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">povar sounds like one weird server. on emarr i dont think hardly anyone exps in all these places anymore. all people want is pop experience.<br />
<br />
i dont see whats wrong in just going to velks and seb and doing your exp grinding there. sure it will take a little longer but all you need to do is get to mid 50s and then youll be ready for all the trash mobs in poi pod pon.</div></div><hr />
