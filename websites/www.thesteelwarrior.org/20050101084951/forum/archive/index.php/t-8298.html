<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikken</div><div class="date">07-29-2004, 12:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, so I've decided that getting the 10th Coldain ring would be a nice upgrade for my current rings. I've found some nice information at http://www.red3.com/TWC/Quest/QColdainRing1.htm and various other sites. However, I haven't been able to find out if the quest is MQable or not, or to what point. Ideally I could do all the rings upto the 10th with my druid and simply loot the head with Vikken. My druid is much more efficient at moving around than a warrior. I was wondering if I could turn in the Coldain Hero's Insignia ring with my druid, Aeriwen, and then turn in the head with my warrior, Vikken, and recieve the final ring in return with Vikken. So, in shrt, can you MQ the final turn in?<br />
<br />
If not, is there a point on any of the rings, where it can be MQed to save time?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">07-29-2004, 02:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">you can MQ the 8th war very easily</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikken</div><div class="date">07-29-2004, 05:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So you're saying to start the 8th ring mini war and loot the chiefs head with Vikken, turn it in to Garadain for the 8th ring?<br />
<br />
I guess I'll do that unless someone else knows a later point which I can do the MQ. i would do it all the way through on the warrior, but its such a waste of time doing all that running around with no sow and no ports. I've already got all the droppable pieces ready and soon I hope to get started. I'll probably do it after the server repop. I still got to catch Heratus up so I can finish the Katta shield quest.<br />
<br />
After I get the 8th ring, I guess I can go ahead and start the SotE quest. Slowly but surely moving through my non-visable slots for upgrades, they take forever...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not trying to be an ass here, just asking.  Honestly I think 8th would be as far as you could go without some SERIOUS support, and even 8th is gonna be rough for that druid to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikken</div><div class="date">07-29-2004, 06:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ya, but I got leet sk33lz :P I have no reason to think that my druid can't handle the quest. Druid has 1800hps because she never gets hit. Seriously dude, you've been playing a warrior too long. hehe<br />
<br />
Oh, and I'll have group support for the 8th and 9th, and guild support for the 10th.</div></div><hr />

Are you suggesting that because I'm not 65 with x AA, I shouldn't be shooting for the best gear that I can obtain for each slot. It is my understanding that getting the 10th ring requires SERIOUS support for everyone but the completely uber...<br />

Are you suggesting I give up now while I'm ahead, cause quite frankly I don't know how to be anything but a little offended by your remark. Thats just me being honest, I'm not trying to start an arguement here. I'm just trying to see where your coming from.</div></div><hr />

I'm making sure you're aware of it.  Some people aren't.  Poxbreath is gonna eat your druid for breakfast if you get rooted.  For the 8th ring, you need to be able to single out the Chief and kill him in a VERY confined area.  Escorting the dorf requires you to drop a pretty big group of giants, and I don't think you're gonna be quad kiting them.  All I'm doing is making sure that you aren't planning on doing this with a 58 druid alone, because if that's the plan, then it wasn't gonna work. Some people don't know that kinda stuff.<br />
<br />
Oh, and by the way, I played a necro for a year and a half.  I know damned well what casters can do, and I also know what casters can do against other casters (Jack and shit, thank you very much).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikken</div><div class="date">07-29-2004, 07:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, yes, I guess most player like playing against content they are completely sure they can beat. I guess I haven't died enough time from stupid shit yet. Soloed a mosquito in PoD the other day with my druid and a charmed rat...what a rush.<br />
<br />
I just like doing stupidly hard crap like that. XP grinding and long ass camp drive me nuts. My usual crew that I play with most nights are the same way. We are alway doing different things, going to different dungeons, trying unused zones, and try crazy tactics. Keep the game alive for us. Maybe soon we'll start hitting GoD, and seeing whats out there. For some reason long ass corpse runs don't seem to bother us much, and most gear goes to the player that needs it the most. We sorta just stick together and push through empty zones were we can play in peace without asshat distractions.<br />
<br />
From your other posts it seem that you have a similar group that you play with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikken</div><div class="date">07-29-2004, 07:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Grrr...server repop and still no heratus. sigh...I guess I'll go get some sleep then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">faederya</div><div class="date">07-29-2004, 08:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I do not believe that you will be able to much of 1-8 without atleast one other front-line melee type.<br />
<br />
You can't do the vial turn in, you can't do the handcuff turn in walk, you can't do the follow the wolf part, you can't kill for the traitors head, you can't do the Kael plate house cycle. and you can't do the part in GD in the cave.<br />
<br />
My suggestion is too use the warrior and get a healer friend (shaman, druid, cleric) to help you through.  Y'al can do them in one day if the mobs are up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's not what I'm saying at all, like I said a couple posts ago, I'm not trying to be an ass here, but I know that's the way the internet makes it sound sometimes.<br />
<br />
All I'm saying is that I've done 1-8 (just don't feel like doing 9 just so I can have a 9th ring bagged for effect rather than 8th), with my warrior and shaman, and it was a fuckin cakewalk.  I basically did all the quests in one day.  <br />
<br />
HOWEVER<br />
<br />
If you're thinking that you can just kite this crap around, that's not gonna work out so well.  I'm not saying it to be a dick, i'm saying it to save you some time redoing quests.  A melee + a healer is honestly the best way to go here, because there's a lot of shit where casters aren't gonna cut it if they're not extremely high end.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">07-29-2004, 12:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I used to know a 60 druid that used to solo the 1-7 rings and MQ'd #8 for plat.  I don't know how she did it, but I think it's possible with liberal use of harmony and root.  Druids are tricky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Niclet</div><div class="date">07-30-2004, 04:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've done rings 1-8 solo a few times (for alts etc) with my 65 druid.  The first time he had maybe 50aas.  He now has 200+ and it is a complete cakewalk.  Mostly bazaar gear/ornatish quality.  <br />
<br />
There are a couple of places that can get dicey because of high mob MR and/or sheer volume of mobs.  Tactics can make even these easy.  As can judicious use of egress and bind spots.<br />
<br />
These days I'd probably 2-box it to eliminate risk, but it can most definitely be done solo.  It's a fun challenge the first time around.  At 58 with the crap HPs you listed it would certainly be exciting.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, many people play druids poorly.  They have a big toolkit at their disposal.  between bind, gate, egress, exodus and innate cammo you can get alot done as a poor-man's monk.<br />
<br />
That said, I prefer to two-box these days, especially with my warrior :)</div></div><hr />
