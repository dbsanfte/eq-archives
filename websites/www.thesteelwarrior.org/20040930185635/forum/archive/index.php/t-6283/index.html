<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Frig Coldheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My guild is working on getting flagged for tactics by doing the Diaku quest in PoStorms. <br />
<br />
Question is after a few of us are flagged can we take a group into PoT even if all group members are not flagged yet. Kinda like the BoT tower key just 1 in grp needs key there. Not sure if Tactics is that way or all members of a group have to be flagged.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Each person needs their own flag.  However, the quest gives flags to all 6 group members when one person turns in the items to Wembly (but all 6 people need high enough Askr faction, from killing giants).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Frig Coldheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks. Looks like we will be killing Diaku's for awhile then. Atleast this area is decent exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Keane Abrams</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">but all 6 people need high enough Askr faction, from killing giants <br />
<br />
Not true. Only the people doing the actual turn ins need the right faction. This quest can be MQed, but again, any person who turns in a piece has to get the text from the npc.<br />
<br />
Anyone who is in the group of the person who turns in the 4th piece will get a Tactics flag. I flagged a 49 rogue who never touched a giant doing this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Azaza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Amiable faction required for the person doing the turn in.<br />
<br />
To raise faction, kill giants in BoT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Frig Coldheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Killing giants in BoT is no problem. Most of our main players have spent alot of time in BoT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I have personally seen Wembly refuse to give the quest because another member of the group had insufficient Askr faction.  In one case we replaced the 6th person with someone else who had more faction, and then Wembly gave the quest (to the same person).  In another case, we went out and killed 20 more giants, which gave the 6th person enough faction, and then Wembly gave the quest (to the same person).<br />
<br />
Perhaps they changed how this works at some point, though.</div></div><hr />
