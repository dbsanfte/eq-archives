We went back the next night and now nothing is charmable or seems to be. We have yet found a way to kill the first named, atleast the group i go with. Is there something we are doing wrong? Ive had 2 clerics there with me, ive had cleric druid, ive tried different combos, and im reading warriors tanking that named with 1 cleric... yes i know they have 11k but come on thats ONE more hit if that. Im mostly ele, some time, the others i group with are full or close to it time gear wise. Is this something i can just say screw till i get 11k and that 1.5k or so hps make THAT much difference?</div></div><hr />

Yes. This is meant for Time+ geared players.</div></div><hr />

Also did they nerf the charm there completely or is it only certain mobs that can get charmed now in ikkinz?</div></div><hr />

<br />
And the differene between 11K and 10K is not one more hit.</div></div><hr />

AC seems to be even bigger in GoD than it is in PoP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Surlok</div><div class="date">02-22-2004, 11:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah you have to not look directly at the HP but also the AC.<br />
<br />
I have close to 2200 AC full buffed while a war with only just under 10k could only have say 1600-1700. 400 or so AC is a pretty large margin.It means that while that one hit might cover the spread in HP,the rest of the hits that got you to 10 might be twice as much as the 11k one took...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kalorn Iceblade</div><div class="date">02-23-2004, 01:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">From chatting with some of our clerics they say they definitely notice the difference from a tank with 10k+ hps and 2200+ ac and a tank with say 10k hps and only 1800 ac. Seems like most GoD mobs have very high attack rating - especially in Kod'Taz and Ikkinz. Really atm I'm more and more looking at high ac items/augs - even more so than what we did look for in PoP.</div></div><hr />

Diablo destroyer ended up owning us though, but that was due the adds.<br />
<br />
I dont think another 100 ac and say 500 hps will make me able to &quot;safely&quot; tank the named there using just one cleric tbh. I am thinking 12k+ and 2300 ac + before that doable.<br />
<br />
Its a challenge for sure.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Another warior in my guild w/ about 11k hp, and 2100ac has killed him first try twice now w/ 1 cleric, and a shaman healing *also a second cleric but this cleric has no focus, healing aa's, etc, and ch's which if you've done this trial you know how useless CH is and most of the time only does 2khp heal on average with a cleric using SL and shaman w/ tnarg's</div></div><hr />

<br />
This expansion was obviously meant for 80% + time geared people, the people in my group were the best equpied in my guild besides myself. i'm like 4th warrior wise maybe 5th now in hp.  Though you can prolly get your kod taz flag slightly undergeared, but kod taz trials are impossible w/o good gear/skill.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not a chance in hell of tanking those named with JUST a Cleric healing. Their heals just can't keep up with the DPS output.<br />
<br />
Ideally, I want two.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">02-23-2004, 04:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My cleric CHs because I don't have a DBoW and wasn't about to test if Vanazir is enough for chain SL.  It actually works pretty well, or as well as you could expect it to, though Time Rend was a significant part of our mitigation as well.  <br />
<br />
AC is more important than HPs because sometimes you can't even keep up with the DPS healing at maximum efficency.  If you have one cleric and a Knight with 50K HP and normal time-level AC, the Pixtts would still win (assuming no 18K crit CHs are allowed) because each time you land a CH for 9K she'd do more than 9K damage in that period and your HPs would run out first.</div></div><hr />

I managed to stay alive on the Rav (trial 2 mini) with CH from one cleric and chain SL from the second (was not intentional, first cleric didn't realise we were fighting a named mob :p). We use chain SL on the other bosses though, since they are Ixt / Kyv and therefore they average 950dps (that's under def) thanks to their accuracy bonus.</div></div><hr />

Actually, just shy (12.9*) using standard food and EoE, instead of shield.<br />
<br />
Doesn't matter. <br />
<br />
Fact of the matter is, pretty much the highest equipment level attainable in game at the moment still isn't tanking this with one Cleric. Not even close.</div></div><hr />

Have done ikkinz only twice now.  First time was more or less a learning exp.  2nd time we went in with cle / dru / sham / bard / pal / me.  Tanked named with the exception of DD with not much problem. Cleric / dru spam heals. Sham kept Qui up.  each mini died in under 2min or so with stonewall and cornered.  Didn't get a chance to get to dd as zone crashed.  Only died once on the 2nd Pixxt due to a warping problem.</div></div><hr />

I am a little shy of 12khp and at about 2.1k AC buffed and had no problem with them. Group make-up was Warrior, cleric, ranger, monk, bard, chanter.</div></div><hr />

Im at 11.8k hps 2470ish ac and really have no problem doing him with 1 cleric..is nice to have a druid or shm to back up heal but spamming short heals works fine.  The key to the fight is furious to start..will drop him to 80% and last just about long enough for pets to despawn...hit stonewall once furious drops and you are golden.  Also ds is huge in this fight..adding a druid for thorns and wood will cut about a minute off the fight which is only about 2-21/2 mins to begin with.  If you wanna bitch about a mob talk about diabolical destroyer =p.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Surlok</div><div class="date">02-28-2004, 11:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have had PA down to 68% with one cleric,without using Furious off the get go.<br />
<br />
That is with 11.2k atm.<br />
<br />
It certainly is possible,but it depends to much on luck imo where as a cleric and Druid/Shaman/Cleric  pretty much gaurantees the win.<br />
<br />
<br />
We have had a 9.4k Alt war,not even EP equipped get to Diabolical and tank it down to 70% or so.That was with 2 Time clerics though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pahtoonya</div><div class="date">02-28-2004, 03:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the key here is that there's only so much skill involved, and the bulk of the encounter is luck... luck on when exactly heals hit, considering lag, luck on streaky mob DPS, etc.<br />
<br />
I'm at 10k and 1900 AC, and out of 6 tries vs a Rav Interceptor with 2 clerics, we won once with me standing.  This is with a comfortable DPS group and time geared clerics- I'm the gimp warrior of the guild.  That one time it was like butter, I never came close to dying, and the strat was identical- and the execution identical- to the 5 prior times in which I'd been destroyed by 60% into the fight.<br />
<br />
I'm all for hard encounters- make me work for that loot, and make the loot match the difficulty. I'm all about busting my ass for the good stuff, and it's even more fun with one group since the victory is so much more personal.<br />
<br />
But when it's a matter of &quot;have more hp and mash heal faster&quot; as your 'winning strat'... well.. that just upsets me.  The varying degree of HP/AC tanks that have alreayd posted here showing their varying degrees of success (or failure) says that it most certainly is a lot of luck and less skill.<br />

<br />
Since it was late night we were only 6 players working on it, so buff setup was virtue + bst buffs. I was at 10800 hps and think it was 2050 ac or so. I have 2 % shielding.<br />
<br />
Clerics used a CH rotation, then switched to SL when disc wore off, fought about 1 min out of disc, maybe a little less.<br />
<br />
One of the best victories in a long time!<br />
<br />
Our motto of the evening ended up being:<br />
<br />
&quot;Planets were finally perfectly aligned&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just quick mezzes seemed more than sufficient to keep them under control.</div></div><hr />

<br />
About adds a single enchanter using bliss can handle them all, but when 1 pop, there is still a chance he will beat cleric or MT for a few seconds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am sure there are different ways of doing this, however, in the end, this worked for us.</div></div><hr />
