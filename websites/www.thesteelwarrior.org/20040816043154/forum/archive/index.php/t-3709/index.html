<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Findra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Future Plans for October\November, 2003<br />
<br />
Those of us behind the scenes here on the EverQuest team have plans for the future of the game.  Further Down the Line is where we will keep you informed about what those plans are.  Please understand that these are our long-term plans and may require a fair amount of research or development time.<br />
<br />
Development on the following projects continues.  We appreciate your patience as we work out the details.<br />
<br />
Class Balance<br />
<br />
We're still planning to take a look at improving the damage capabilities of melee classes, as they've fallen behind their magic-using counterparts at the very high end of the game.  Finding the proper solutions for this situation will take some time.  Some options being considered are:<br />
<br />
Improve melee damage-increasing disciplines<br />
Improve Planes of Power melee weapons<br />
<br />
Additionally, we're looking at the concerns from players about their spells, and changing them where appropriate.  The goal here is to remove annoying issues with spells, not necessarily to increase caster power overall.<br />
<br />
Shields and blocking<br />
<br />
We're planning on reviewing the possibility of giving an innate chance to block when using a shield.  We've been hoping to do this for a while, and it should be getting a realistic review in the near future.  We'd like to increase the value of shields, and make it a worthwhile choice for players who might normally dual-wield weapons or use a two-handed weapon.  We plan on balancing this against classes which use shields by default, and therefore wouldn't be making any trade-offs to equip a shield. <br />
<br />
Nothing like cut &amp; paste.  /sigh<br />
<br />
Edit - removed some extraneous spaces.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">wasnt it absor that said &quot;we dont balance classes with boxed content&quot; what the fuck are plane of power weapons unless you decided to make it free to all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Omnidream</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think the reason that Planes of Power weapons were mentioned is because they only stated a lack of melee damage in the high end game. And where is the high end game these days?  Well for the most part it's in PoP. I don't think they plan on making all melee weapons better so they had to judge and see where it's needed most. But then again... I'm normally wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tierleaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yay they changed the date on it.</div></div><hr />

/blink i thought the were, now there just planning to maybe look at it??????</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">What I don't get is... they say the very high end, yet imo it's worse with people who have lower end gear.  Any 65 caster can get ID4 now (fairly common belt in normal tak I believe), and get the highest power spells (for a price).  Yet melee can't get weapons that can compare unless they join the higher end guilds.  Higher end casters get better focus but I still think the difference is larger at lower ends.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">That would be because SOE and,  regrettably, a substantial portion of the player base, have lost the perspective of the mid-game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bigchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">if they give us another dps disc with a 1 hour reuse time linked to defensive i will be mad and sad :( unless of course they get rid of defensive and give us real mitigation</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">They're not going to be doing anything.<br />
<br />
They've been copying and pasting that same news... not even taking TIME to rewrite a different article..<br />
because they're too busy milking money out of the stuff that works..<br />
<br />
They said at a fan faire they wont do anything to casters before melees are fixed...<br />
but casters dont need anything done to them for the next 3 years at least...<br />
they'll still get new awseome spells with the next expansion though... but remember, that has nothing to do with class balance!<br />
<br />
Arg, wish this post was in the Outhouse, I'm so tempted in insulting Absor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Wolveren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">And the most insulting part of that post: <br />
<br />
We appreciate your patience</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>uhrlik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">No, they really do appreciate our patience. If we lost our patience, we might actually find a way to do something about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Glatius2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I plan to someday have a plan.  And once I have that plan, I'm planning to look at my plan.  And then once I've looked at my plan, I'm planning on implementing my plan.  But of couse this is all contingent on my actually following through on my plan to have a plan.<br />
<br />
All this is just in the planning stage though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>ODB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">So that was the future &quot;PLANS&quot;, this is what to expect though for November.....<br />
<br />
<br />
Our update on October 9th went very well. You can read the details here. <br />
<br />
Here are some things we're working on for the November update: (Please note: my producer is making me tell you that in addition to this list, we'll still be bug fixing and maintaining the live game and that, while we hope to get each of these features in, nothing is certain. But this is what we're working on at the present time.) <br />
<br />
<br />
New LDoN raids will go Live - We be moving the two new raids that were introduced on Stormhammer to the Live servers. These raids will prove an interesting challenge for the best of guilds. <br />
<br />
Another new LDoN raid - We will also be bringing one more new LDoN raid to Stormhammer with our next update. This raid will be created with Elemental capable characters in mind. <br />
<br />
Font changes - Since EverQuest was launched, there has only been one font available. With the next update we plan to introduce the option for players to choose the font for their interface. <br />
<br />
Targeting - Sometimes it can be difficult to tell which NPC you have targeted. With the next update we hope to add a targeting indicator of some sort (something like the ring that surrounds your target in EQOA). The exact form hasn't been decided, but the goal is to make seeing what you currently have targeted much easier. <br />
<br />
Consider - Along the same lines as the proposed improvement to targeting, we want to add a way to distinguish the /con color of your target. We plan an indicator that will be easily distinguished once you have a target (probably someplace in the Target window), that should remove the need to use the /con command. <br />
<br />
Other interface changes - We are also working on some other changes that will help you to organize your information. We plan to add a new text color option for damage shield reports that will allow you to pick what color those messages use. We also want to split the &quot;My Pet Attacks&quot; filter into two separate filters, one for hits and one for misses. <br />
<br />
/tell windows - It is very easy to lose /tells in the confusion of combat. We want to add an option that would work much like an instant messenger. Each time you get a &quot;tell&quot; from a new character, a new chat window would open. That window will only display &quot;tells&quot; from the particular character, and any message sent from the chat window would automatically be sent as a &quot;tell&quot; to that character. Obviously this would be an optional feature. <br />
<br />
Help for new players - New characters will start with a bag. This will give them a little more storage space and the opportunity to learn how storage containers work earlier rather than later. We are also working on removing one of the more tedious &quot;features&quot; of the game, the need to practice Sense Heading. Most folks have that skill mapped to trigger along with one of their movement keys. Not an exciting skill to practice. So we plan to have all characters start with a 200 skill in Sense Heading. This will allow new players to navigate more easily, and will reduce a bit of tedium over the course of gameplay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>ODB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">But hey, we got Anger and stun augments so SOE thinks we're content to wait it out...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>landrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Well most of this I have no problem with, and like most of them.<br />
<br />
These are almost all interface changes, <br />
te Targetting is a GREAT addition. Especially on raids, with lag and damn casters ping ponging.<br />
The /con, /tell, filtering better is all very good. <br />
Font change is ho hum, takes 3 minutes to implement.<br />
The bag is just silly.<br />
<br />
However...<br />
They added only one piece of new content, a new raid on Stormhammer. And from the way the new system work, these are best done by one person.<br />
<br />
IF, SoE has different teams for Content/Interface this actually is perhaps a good sign. no new spells, etc etc.. so maybe they are working on Melee Balance.<br />
<br />
then again I play a warrior..<br />
<br />
probably suffering from too many blows to the head..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Platinia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
But hey, we got Anger and stun augments so SOE thinks we're content to wait it out...<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes If you got the luck to get Groups to make your ADV Points and not sitting around LFG until your Guild  start Raiding.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Lens314</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Notice they only talk about melee damage and weapons, nothing about aggro issues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>ODB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Probably too many blows to the head, aye. None of these changes were mentioned in the last 6 months, but the melee shit keeps getting cut&amp;pasted =/<br />
<br />
Pop up windows when you get a tell? real bright idea there, considering some people still have troubles with all spells off, dynamic lights off, models off, a metric fuckton of chat messages off and running with 1... maybe 2 chat windows. Can you imagin being a guild officer taking tells for loot when this crap goes live? Better have a toggle on it.<br />
<br />
Newbies dont need a bag to start with, they have newbie quests, they can go to any of the newbie quest starters and get a container for free.<br />
<br />
Over 4 years ago they made the name over your target's head flash. Is it that hard to make sure all NPCs have a name over their head? PS SOE, some mobs have their names in their torso's, that would be a nice fix.<br />
<br />
Font changes is fine and dandy, but I hope it will be client side so people wont have to read 200 different fonts every time they go to the bazaar.<br />
<br />
Starting newbies out with Sense Heading 200? Get the fuck outta here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>ODB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Notice they only talk about melee damage and weapons, nothing about aggro issues. That's because they keep cutting and pasting the crap, but in reality, they aren't even looking into anything.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 <br />
<br />
they said the tells WOULD be an option, personally I wish they had a sound also.<br />
<br />
As far as the name.. well some mobs DONT have names... For those situation it is a godsend. Also sometimes you may have 10-20 mobs all the same name in camp, along with 50 raiders, fiding a flashing name, can be problematic.<br />
<br />
<br />
AND again, these are interface upgrades not content or class balancing changes. IF they have different teams, which any competent programming design team would have this is not a problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>ODB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">If they had different teams for the different improvements to the game then I think they would have given a bit more word on what they were doing to melee. I don't think they have different teams. Maybe they do for the different games they have, but that's about it. Seems like their team goes from one thing to another.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Hyardgune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">They do have teams for different areas.  Unfortunately the melee team is still trying to figure out how to get off the short bus.<br />
<br />
You ever get the feeling that at SoE, the melee developers get shoved in lockers and given swirlies by the caster developers?</div></div><hr />

I plan on reading your planned plan as soon as I plan on having some planned free time.  :)</div></div><hr />
