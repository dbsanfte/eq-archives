<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am a level 40 warrior.  My wife plays a 38 shaman, her son a 38 cleric, her daughter a 36 enchanter.  A friend of mine has a 35 bst, and we are leveling up a rogue for my wife's cousin.  In other words, we have a pretty balanced single group.<br />
<br />
What I'd like to know is first, what level should we start hitting Kael for Thurg quest armor?  Is level 45 too early, do we need to be 50-51+?<br />
<br />
Also, where are the best places we can go to all get gear, or most importantly, warrior gear.  :)  We've been talking about trying the Hollowshade War, is that possible for a group of high 30's, low 40's?<br />
<br />
I also have a level 65 wizard that I have retired but like to play solo sometimes...  where are some good places for him to camp gear.  I've gotten an fbss in lguk and other items, and have been hitting Nurga recently, some good drops there.<br />
<br />
Too many questions I know.  :)  Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">For Thurg armor, there is no level restriction (I think), all you need is good enough faction.  Can't remember what level you can start doing kael, but if you're going in as a group rather than with a raid, I'd say low 50's minimum, at least if you want a decent chance at armor drops.  See what you can buy in the bazaar.  Odds are there will be stuff there that's dirt cheap and will tide you over until you can get Thurg gear. Or if you have plenty of cash and were wise enough to start a tribunal worshipping barbarian or an RZ worshipper, you can get Fierce Heraldic or Helanic Tundra armor that'll be better than Thurg quest gear in most slots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Binnamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Like 99% sure that it is level 1 for each velious armor. As long as you have faction.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
99% sure only because thinking back... I'm not sure if the numerous posts I've read on the subject have said ALL VELIOUS ARMOR or just thurg.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Telen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">My wife created my warrior for me and chose agnostic.  :\  This was with the advice of her brother who owns 4 level 65 chars and often triple-quad boxes them...  You'd think he'd know better.  :p<br />
<br />
But alas I don't want to re-roll so I am screwed as far as cultural armor...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Khazzuz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I would think by the time you get to mid 40s with a full group you could possibly handle doing the bank area if you're safe about it.  Drop rate isn't at good, but the possibility is at least there.  For the arena I wouldn't recommend going in there until you are at least low 50s.  Its possible to be done with a group of low 50s but without any experience in there it would be tough to say the least.  All in all, being agnostic, Kael isn't a bad way to get some cheap upgrades, and besides, you'll get some exp and I personally think Kael is a helluva fun zone :)  Good luck to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jaago</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You're far from screwed on cultural armor Telen.  Fine Heraldic is better than most of the Thurg armor pieces.  My frog warrior is wearing almost full Brellium(same stats as Fine Heraldic) and the only better piece for him would be the Thurg gloves.  The BP would be nice for the clicky heal though...<br />
<br />
I'd wait til low 50s if you want to camp the arena though.  With your group of friends/family you should be able to get a few drops a night when you can start killing at a fair pace.</div></div><hr />

I know you're pain...I made the same mistake with my troll warrior (now 62)...</div></div><hr />
