Will getting the last two lvls make a difference?</div></div><hr />

There are a lot of mobs highly resistant and or immune to fire based spells. Being level 65 will help a little, but overall not much.</div></div><hr />

You can't do anything about it, but shamans(Malo/sini), mages (Malosini), bards(harmony/occlusion), and druids(ro) can all reduce the ability of the mob to resist it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redleaf</div><div class="date">08-10-2004, 05:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yup, it gets resisted a lot.  That is one reason the epic is not well liked.  There is nothing much you can do but debuff.  I would suggest trying to upgrade it as fast as you can.  I got mine and used it for a total of a month before upgrading to a CHSD and GBoS.<br />

It procs Tash and will help lower mob's resists.  If you do this, more than likely by the time you realize it doesn't help much you will have a weapon better than the epic to wield :)<br />

Tash is decent aggro though, so it isnt a total waste of time.<br />

I know that concussion (wizard deagro spell) has been tested to work just as well on a resist as if it lands, and I also know from the beatings I took in my lower lvls that resisted spells definately cause agro, seeminly at the same level as if they landed.  I suspect that this should work the same.<br />

I dunno, I think epics are pretty solid aggro, especially if you aug'd them.  I've pulled aggro from a DBoTWL/EoE combo before(while using the 1hs, and 2hs), all in all it's about how lucky you get with the RNG.<br />
<br />
I definatley which I would have gotten my epics alot sooner than what I did, they're really great if you're an up and coming tank.</div></div><hr />
