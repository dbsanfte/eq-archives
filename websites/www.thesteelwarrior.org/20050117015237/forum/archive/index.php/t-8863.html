<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maladroit</div><div class="date">09-10-2004, 07:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use a Bloodfrenzy and  AHBS, I also have a BoW but for some reason My DPS is greater with the duel wield and the BF procs more then the BoW in a single fight. <br />
<br />
Why and How is this Possible.  AA's ?  Does the DLY of the BF vs the BoW have anything to do with it ? <br />
<br />
My thoughts were as follows. <br />
<br />
Currantly all of my AA's thus far have been put into 1h enhancement Ambidex, ect ect , while i have spent nothing to enhance my 2h preformance.  <br />
<br />
if im correct Procs are based on rolls ?  the faster the DLY the More chances of a Proc ? <br />
<br />
Also is the Enraging Blow effect on the BoW and BF infact one in the same ?<br />
<br />
Please clear this up for me. Thank you. :confused:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Plus; he more 2H aa's you get; the better 2H gets ( which you said and are correct ). <br />
<br />
Stick with your 1Hers; grind them aa's...than watch your BoW shine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">09-10-2004, 07:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The bloodfrenzy will always proc more than your BoW.  It is one of the very few weapons in the game with an enhanced proc rate.  Yes both have exactly the same effect.  How much did you parse the BoW vs. BF/AHBS to determine your dps?  The BoW should be considerably better than that combo for dps, even with ambidex and no punishing blade.  <br />
<br />
Procrate is fixed.  As your weapon delay goes down, so does your chance to proc on each swing so for the most part procrate is independent of delay.  The bloodfrenzy should proc about 1.5X as much as a BoW but it is due to the weapons innate procrate modifier and not its delay.</div></div><hr />

I'm sure any guild that is at the level of Bloodfrenzy and BoW drops would appreciate their warriors knowing that info.</div></div><hr />

Only thing I can think about is a lack of flurry and severe low atk which will not be kind to your 2h damage curves.</div></div><hr />

BoW does have a lower proc aggro then the dualhand, almost any 1h's will beat it procwise. The DPS aggro is what comes into play, without any AAs for 2h, it is hard to see. Start working on them and test out with your BoW, it only gets better and better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunnar</div><div class="date">09-11-2004, 02:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't see how your BF and AHB are out dps'n your BOW.I had those weapons (tho i used the AHB for dps not tanking)and the BOW was a huge jump for me in dps even before I got my 2h aa.<br />
<br />
Same proc.As Brutul said the Bf has a proc mod to make it proc more often though.In actual gameplay tanking everyday in GOD and raiding Time I still see no adavantage to the BF/watever combo over the BOW.This ground has been gone over.However, I'm guildleader/raidleader for my folks now and I have been using the other heavy tanks a lot where i used to tank most everything when i was just MT.I get tells from dps all day long about their aggro balance overtime on mobs.<br />
<br />
Regardless,of folks opinions of the advantage of 1hs over the BOW with the new aa it doesnt pan out for us in gameplay.When we get dbotw's I'll be looking to upgrade.My aggro over time is still probably the strongest in my guild and I usually end up tanking TZ and VZ in time with good aggro results.The BOW is a great tanking weapon until time/god 1 handers come along and better dps then earlier 1 handers as well.</div></div><hr />
