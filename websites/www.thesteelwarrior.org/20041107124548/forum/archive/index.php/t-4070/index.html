Not a big surprise I guess.. <br />
<br />
But it does make you wonder exactly what it is we are giving up having a spellbook for. <br />
<br />
I used to think it was for our ability to be the only ones able to tank the extreme high-end mobs, but that obviously is not the case any longer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bullshit Phantron. <br />
<br />
Edit: Let me qualify this - A paladin tanking Quarm and living signifies the end of everything Warrior. It takes a big yellow high-lighter and makes a nice fat mark on how FUCKED UP itemization is, how fucked up class balance is, and how fucked up Everquest is... have you ever tanked Quarm? Out of defensive? The fact that a Paladin could live through an entire fight and take every hit, slowed or not, should tell you a whole lot. <br />
<br />
And if you actually believe that a Knight cannot tank every mob in Time you're delusional. Any mob a Warrior can tank out of /disc for any extended period of time (read: EVERY MOB), a Knight can also tank. Not being able to understand this is your problem.</div></div><hr />

When Paladins regulary start tanking over warriors in raid situations. (LDoN PoTime needs to bechanged here imo) Then warrior raid roles will really be in jeopardy, however, the fact that someone who has really maxxed out possible items, and gotten bonus's from next exspanation, can tank endgame boss with a perfect CH chain really isnt surprising given the nature of the combat system....<br />

I'm sure Paladins could have/did tank VT in Luclin.. Velious isnt a good example, because it took so long for guilds to kill him at all. Other boss's tho? Undoubtably, its just not effecient, nor easy, espcially until you've actually killed the said mob</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kavak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Well I think this finally puts the nail in the coffin to those who kept saying that:-<br />
 <br />
A)warriors were  significant tanks over everyone else without defensive.<br />
<br />
B) That Bullwark of Vie would not fuck the tanking game up even further<br />
<br />
C) That there is nothing currently wrong with the tanking game.<br />
<br />
<br />
Of course most people with more than 5 brain cells realised this months ago, but I digress.<br />
<br />
Knights have become such good tanks that with BOV they can tank anything a warrior even with defensive can (ie pretty much anything). If a monk who has BOV chained on him can have close to identical migitation to a warrior (re: Monk tanks Fennin Ro) using defensive when he can then you can make your own assumptions about knights. <br />
<br />
I would love to see a parse with a warrior that does not have BOV yet hits defensive when he can, and a Paladin that is BOVied everytime it drops.</div></div><hr />

Paladins bitch over and over and over and over and over again about their raid roles -- which is retarded because paladins kick ass on raids -- and whine about warriors are raid gods. But when something like this comes along, now it just doesn't mean anything? WTF? Quarm is now just some old raid target?</div></div><hr />

Man I knew it that Paladins would come here and DOWNPLAY this like it is not no big deal.  HE TANKED QUARM doesnt matter what you say or what EQuipment he has.  It SHOULD not be POSSIBLE at all.   We are talking about QUARM here not Luclin boss mobs. Velious boss mobs or whatever.  This is so fucked up on so many levels that it didnt just make baby jebus cry it actually killed him.<br />

Hi, thanks for bringing that up. I do believe that my guild has the best record on LDoN raids serverwide as we have beaten Ruj Zerker, Valdoon, and Miragul's Synarcana - within the time limits/death counts - yes 30 whole points - and before anyone else (i.e. weeks ago to a month+ ago). Do you know why and how? Are you sitting down Madrone, this may come as a SHOCK to you. READY? Here's the secret. We have our Knights tank EVERYTHING. It's a LOVELY thing to have heavily armored tanks that can take hits, keep mobs aggro locked, buff and heal their groups, put out incredible damage, and myriad other utilities. Unfortunately, that means on specific raids, if requisite Knights are not online, we have to cancel. That's happened twice now. Sure makes me and the other warriors feel all warm and fuzzy inside.<br />
<br />
What I think I'm trying to say is, shut the fuck up. Sorry if that came out harsh, I've had enough of you and every other fucking Knight spreading their bullshit propoganda on message boards. Enough is enough - I have FUCKING HAD IT with Paladins and Shadowknights.</div></div><hr />

Ok, scratch the 'no raid ever gets cancelled for lack of knights classes' excuse. Heh, the irony. So i wonder what new rationalisation the paladin's will fixate upon - the list's running pretty low. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">First Off I wasnt refering to AHR (ok or TVK/EMP, Luclin just didnt have many bad ass melee mobs) , or AOW, in there present Form, I was refering to them at the time when they were the &quot;End game&quot; The baddest the game had to offer at that present point. (Which, actually, Quarm is not, There has been an increase of 90 HP from LoY, and around 600 HP From LDoN? (Just from Vendor Augs, not counting Riad Augs + Adventure Stone?   For the Purpose, so around 700 Raw HP. With ND/PD/PE That Probably Rounds to 900HP. Factor in Equipment upgrades gained from when guilds first did Quarm, and your looking at quite a hefty Improvement in the overall HP of the Entire guild. (And tanking abilitity)<br />
<br />
Basically what it boils down to is, should a warrior have such an advantage in tanking ability, that no other class can reach the baseline plateu it takes to tank something, given the upgrades that are achieved through farming the zone? (Not Withstanding  a good 1/4 upgrade in amount of HP obbtainable, without 1/4 an exspanations amount of real Raiding Content, at least it hasnt been enough for some mob to Dethrone Quarm as the Current Endgame boss. Even though its not the true endgame? Well it sorta is, but theres upgrades past or parrell to him, that wernt factored in when designing the encounter origianll (Charm/Augs) Toss in massing farming of equippment... No real surpirse.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, Why should it not be possible? I'm sure given as much equipment a druid could rep a cleric in chain on Quarm. I'm sure given enough Equipment monk could outdamage a rogue, but guess what. That cleric given the same level of equipment will heal better, so will that roug DPS better, and warrior tank better<br />
<br />
<br />
I agree on most issues about groups, and warriors needing help, but this really isnt a surprise given the nature of the EQ combat system....<br />
<br />
But, any mob that can be tanked w/o Defensive for long Period of time, can be tanked by any other class given the system that EQ has had. Changing this would require a Fundalmental change in the way combat works in EQ, is it fucked up? Maybe so, but its not a surprise...... <br />
<br />
The Paladin who tanked him has  ~300 more HP then What i've been told the warriors who tanked Quarm have on our server when they first engaged him. + BoV being at minumum ~1450 HP assorbed per round assuming all rounds connect (When its most likely to one round someone)<br />
<br />
So Once again I reiterate the question, should an overgeared paladin beable to get to the same HP/AC as it takes for a warrior to tank a mob? Given Farming the encounter, and signicent upgrades elsewhere? (Augs/Charm)<br />

I think this more says that there needs to be more content.<br />

<br />
I agree with you, thats what I was saying,. I know that Knights are almost required/prefered for LDoN Potime, and that was the reason for my comment.I dont think Knights should be a prefered tank for LDoN raids, and that should be balanced (IE Fixxed, perhaps I used the wrong wording. But thats not what this is, this is an overgeared paladin tanking content his guild has mastered... Warriors in raid instances should  *almost* always be the PREFERED tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Tugurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">So if it's just mudflation and itemization that naturally allows knights to replace warriors in tanking fucking QUARM, where's the mudflation and itemization that lets warriors fast heal, group heal, rez, root, stun, cure, loh, buff, quad damage undead, etc, etc, etc? Paladins tell us all the time our raid role balances the fact that they rule us in exp groups (even though only a retard thinks paladins don't kick ass on raids, and never mind farming and soloing). *Now* where are we?</div></div><hr />

There inlies the PROBLEM a PALADIN should NEVER be as close to HP and AC no matter how much farming is DONE.  It is FUCKED up that we can be replace by a HYBRID just because thier is LOOT good enough to allow it.  I dont blame Paladins for this.  I BLAME the incompentance of the DEVELOPERS to design class spefic armor.<br />
<br />
  I DO NOT WANT TO READ another POST saying that PALADINS dont have a use in RAIDS this PROVED everything you said to be a farce.  WE CANT tank as good as a warrrior cant cry about that now.

And once again the answer is no. Time isn't old content. Time is done by my guild and quite a few guilds on a regular basis. Time still has not been cleared on some servers. Is any of this sinking in? <br />
<br />
We don't have anything to fall back on. We don't offer stellar DPS, we can't even offer superior tanking - let alone a full spellbook. Yet everything that we lose is somehow shrugged off as inconsequential or 'not that big of a deal.' You're words are more offensive to me than any string of expletives I could ever dream up. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I dont think Paladins should rule warriors in XP groups... <br />
<br />
  One of my points that I think many people are missing (or maybe just dont agree with!) Its a result of upgrades avaiable from an exspanation that does not offer adequate content to stop raiding the previous exspantion. There are upgrades avaible in game that wernt around when Quarm was first engaged.  Normally this would be ok, because there would be lots of good content to go along with thiose upgrades, but their isnt, LDoN raiding is crappy, and horribly balanced (See Furor' rant about Knights Tanking to prevent death to prevent failure)</div></div><hr />

<br />
The answer is *ABSOLUTELY, POSITIVELY, UNDENIABLY* yes, a resounding yes!   There should absolutely positively be mobs that no one but a warrior can tank.   Otherwise I want aggro premonitions.    I want mobs to sense me thinking about taunting and turning beating on me.    <br />
<br />
<br />
Furthermore, Why should it not be possible?<br />
<br />
Because, we give up a spellbook for this ability to tank.    We consciously cripple ourselves to be the best, and.... because we are told AGAIN in the class descriptions that we are the only ones capable of standing up to the biggest baddest monsters in the game.     It's a REWARD for the bullshit we go through.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

No, that's not the problem. LoY and LDoN are doing exactly what they are supposed to do - provide supplemental content to the playerbase. These are not full fledged raid expansions. PoP is a full fledged, progression based raid expansion.<br />
<br />
This is an itemization problem and a class balance problem. Knights are overpowered. Knights need to be brought back down to reality.</div></div><hr />

and i support the fact that a paladin shouldn't come anywhere close to warrior tankability (is that a word?) when it comes to bossmobs. could care less about xp mobs that an enchanter could tank, but a fucking GOD should just go and deathtouch ANY other class trying to tank them, along the lines of &quot;i won't deal with inferiour beings like you&quot;. or maybe banish them, naggy-style.<br />
<br />
warriors used to have a HP advantage through equipment, which is now almost totally gone. the only thing remaining is the innate hp modifier for sta, which is slightly higher than for other classes. big win. you didn't see a paladin tanking the AoW during velious, did you?<br />
<br />
warriors give up the ability to cast spells (don't give me the &quot;clicky items&quot; talk now, please) to be superior in one thing. tanking. looks like they bent down to pick up the spellbook though, and had a run-in with that lovely baseball bat from a few posts above.<br />

Sorry, you just don't understand. I assume it's because you have never actually been on the receiving end of a Quarm beatdown or set foot in the Plane of Time and are also completely oblivious to what kind of gear and abilities are available to Knights past Velious. <br />
<br />
Without the Plane of Time, this would never have been possible. The items in the Plane of Time made this possible. The augments are IRRELEVANT. It is itemization and class balance in PoP and Luclin which set this chain reaction off.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Magelo links arent' currently working, but I checked the roster.   I'd be curious if it is indeed correct that his function was made easier by LDoN augments or not.<br />
<br />
1. The roster shows Nomilus as having in the 140's AA's.   This is not very high.  Granted, it could be old, but if it's accurate, that's a pretty weak AA number for quarm tanking.<br />
<br />
2. I'd guess that Nomilus hasn't even exhausted the fount of PoP time gear, so it's not as though he's using LDoN augments to trivialize old content.   What i mean by this is that I'm willing to bet that he can be upgraded for significantly more via PoP loot than he has in LDoN augs, which would invalidate your argument that LDoN has made end game PoP content easier, or able to be tanked by a paladin.   <br />
<br />
Your argument would only be valid if he'd exhausted his options in PoP and was still unable to do the job, then fresh with new LDoN augs was able to do it.</div></div><hr />

My Arguement more is that Most people Farm mobs to gear themselfs up, so they can do later encounters... Eventually there is going to be a point where Knights can tank those said mobs reliably, normally this isnt too bad, because your pushing into Later Content, where having the warrior tank is almost needed to do it reliably (Yes I realize this isnt true with LDoN PoTime raids, thats bullshit how it works out atm but thats an arguement for another thread, More referally to the way its historically been)<br />
<br />
The situation is that people are signicently gearing themselfs up past what was designed for that content, making it easier for everyone to do their job. (Not saying its Trivial, just easier) That LDoN Augments, and the continual farming of PoTime, makes it so the Paladin can tank it.<br />
<br />

<br />
A paladin hasnt tanked Quarm on your server either yet (obviously as hes not been killed at all, when He is first killed on your server, I'm 99.99% sure it will be with warriors tanking,  will continue to be with warriors tanking for a signicent time. More then likely almost every single instnace except when someone gets really bored and wants to prove that something is possible (like this instance, and it wont be after the said guild has already mastered, and farmed the encounter)<br />

<br />
In General.<br />
<br />
<br />
If a paladin can tank quarm, what's the point of the warriors tradeoff ? you know, spells, mana....  <br />
<br />
Well, the fact that a warrior is gunna increase the chance of the guild to Kill Quarm, and also for the imost of the breaking/farmage of the mob, it would be extremly helpful to use a class with not only more HP/Mitigation, and of coure evasive/defensive disc.  Is that enough to balance the class's? Maybe, Maybe not, Probably not, But Thats not what my arguement is about<br />
<br />
However this is getting off on a tangent that In my original post I dont think I ever said was right or wrong, my main arguement, is that with all the farming of PoTime, (or any zone, Its just more prevalent issue in PoTime, because the gear on warriors, doesnt really allow you to progress elsewhere, which I also think is wrong, but thats another topic!) and additional gear upgrades avaiable to all Class's, that After a said encounter has been mastered, farmed, and farmed again, if a guild really so desires, that a Paladin should beable to tank it, given a great CCH team. I do think warriors need help and to be better balance, and that itemization is shitty,  I dont think I've Disputed that,  Once again my point is that after all that farming, and upgrades elsewhere, not only is it not a suprirse,  but it should be doable (but not preferable)<br />
<br />
So for people who reply about how its unfair for warriors, or warriors arnt balanced. I AGREE on the part that warriors do need upgrades, I disagree on the fact that overy geared Paladins shouldn't beable to tank encounters they have farmred repetivly, regardless of where it is in the game. I do think the current endgame is too old for cutting edge guilds, and their needs to be some serious new content.<br />

Way to dance around the point of my post and totally disregard everything said in everyone else's posts while putting a spin on your own disgusting class imbalances. <br />
<br />
You could have farmed Kael until your balls burst, given a paladin every single piece of loot in Kael and ToV and he STILL wouldn't have been able to tank the AoW during Velious. Nor would he have been able to tank Emperor Ssra with all of the gear from Aten Ha Ra's vagina.<br />
<br />
It has been clearly demonstrated that Knights don't just tread on a Warrior's SOLE ability, they trample, crush, maim, kill, destroy, and rape it. <br />
<br />
If I were able to buy an Augment that let me cast Wave of Marr but at double the cast time of a Paladin, all the stuns available to a paly, and BSS, WHAT WOULD PALADINS DO? You spineless assholes would be on our nuts like a Hobo on a ham sandwhich.<br />

<br />
Everyone knows that itemization is entirely out of whack when it comes to Planes of Power.  This is no secret, it never has been.  Every piece of gear that is warrior/paladin useable does not favor the warrior and instead the paladin, granting him more use out of it due to his mana.<br />
<br />
Never before in all of Everquest did such itemization so completely throw off balance such as this.  There was always a line that would not be crossed.  The paladin was not, never should have been and never should be a tank that can rival or outdo a warrior as a main tank.<br />
<br />
Paladins split tanking on raids?  That's great, gives us something to do.<br />
<br />
Paladins main tanking argueably the single most difficult planes of power encounter in the game?  No, shouldn't happen.<br />
<br />
Saying &quot;well if a paladin gets the proper items he should be able to tank anything if the classes are balanced properly&quot; is completely illogical when everyone knows that the itemization is a MAJOR benefactor to throwing OFF class balance.<br />
<br />
Itemization is whacked...Quarm didn't prove this, Quarm enforced this idea beyond a doubt.<br />
<br />
The idea that a paladin can tank Quarm is unbelieveably disheartening to warriors, and if I played one I would find myself in a state of total shock for the one thing that was unique to me was torn away from me and put onto someone undeserving and already overpowered as it was.  It was given to someone who already has a large list of other jobs that it can leap to.<br />
<br />
What jobs do warriors have on raids?  In exp groups?<br />
<br />
Tank...tank the one main boss.  Paladins themselves were the greatest advocates of &quot;warriors tank the big mobs, that's your job&quot;.  Allow me to quote a paladin from the Veeshan server...Crinus:<br />
<br />
veeshan.Crinus tells serverwide.paladins:2, 'you have your points I have mine'<br />
<br />
Which is explained in:<br />
<br />
veeshan.Crinus tells serverwide.paladins:2, 'respect me and my role and I will leave you to yours'<br />
<br />
This is the general mood I get from elder players of the Paladin channel with exceptions pending on the time of day.  Other times I get such things as &quot;just delete warriors&quot; and the like.<br />
<br />
But among persons like Crinus the common response is &quot;leave me to my role, I will leave you to yours&quot;.<br />
<br />
So then what is the paladin's role?  To dominate others'?  Is ours an imperialistic one where you start with one role and then enroach upon others'?<br />
<br />
What is a warrior's role?  The class descriptions and we all say it's to main tank...that NO OTHER CLASS IN THE GAME should be able to take the hits like a warrior can or fight the monsters toe to toe a warrior can.<br />
<br />
Quarm is the biggest baddest monster in the game...a paladin is going toe to toe with him.<br />
<br />
Show me the warrior benefit.<br />
<br />
Show me the exclusive warrior role.<br />
<br />
Show me the exclusive paladin role...even though it is my opinion we should not have one.  We are a hybrid..a mixture and in that we should have strengths and weaknesses, but not specialists.  We take a little from warriors, we take a little from clerics, we should not be able to tank LIKE a warrior and heal like a MODERATE CLERIC.<br />
<br />
We should be tanking like a paladin while healing like a moderate cleric.<br />
<br />
Not taking on bosses of inexhausted expansions that still have not fully been completed, farmed OR replaced yet.<br />
<br />
While it has been argued that there are two new ones...they are not full length expansions in the same sense that all prior ones were.<br />
<br />
Legacy of the Ykesha and the Lost Dungeons of Norrath were expansions in the sense that they were released to carry on a failed plot that was started with Planes of Power.  With the release of the Planes of Power they seemed to entirely forget about the story line until the last few days of production.  To remedy this...they have been shooting off expansion after expansion in hopes of tying up the lose ends while in turn draw attention BACK to Norrath and get the &quot;godly syndrome&quot; out of peoples' minds.<br />
<br />
They figured out what made the original Everquest so successful and they're trying to leap back to it, but with the failures of Shadows of Luclin and the ruining of the game they spawned with Planes of Power they seem hesitant to release an entire game breaking expansion...especially when Planes of Power still has not been trivialized or mastered.<br />
<br />
Lost Dungeons of Norrath does not have a progressive advancement system in any way that warrants any kind of loot that nillifies Planes of Power loot, nor does it assist to bring classes back into balance.  While anger augments are assisting in the itemization it is not a fix that warriors are looking for, nor should anyone &quot;settle for it&quot;.<br />
<br />
The road to class balance is going to take a few bumpy turns and some trials and error in order to properly get it in order.<br />
<br />
But stating that things are in balance and then ripping out of random bodily orifices excuses as to why it IS fair that a paladin should tank Quarm doesn't work.<br />
<br />
Face it, we need a nerf.  Our aggro needs to be nerfed, our mitigation needs to be nerfed, our entire itemization needs to be RE-looked at and examined, and warriors need all the help they can get.<br />
<br />
Our stats need to max at lower caps than warriors', our damage needs to be subsidary to them, their ability to hold aggro after a long period of time AND stay alive should be unrivaled.<br />
<br />
We have no right to be taking this from them, and we need to not be nerfed PUNITIVELY but out of the necessity of the integrity of this game.</div></div><hr />

The fact of the matter is not how Frequent a paladin will TANK Quarm is that this on PALADIN proves that it can be done with the gear.  WITH THE GEAR,  Oh yeah guilds will use warriors to tank QUARM WITH THE GEAR.  Which coincides the problem there should be no Equipment in the world that should allow a PALADIN to tank an END GAME Boss like Quarm.          <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The fact that you are not a warrior HOW THE FUCK can you comment on the bad state the we are in in todays game.  SO go back to your little hole and be quiet  until the short bus comes to take you home</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Ubu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">In my opinion all pure melee are pretty fucked up, Rogues, monks, warriors. Have no spells, our only possible way to do damage (feasably dont be a bicth and say i could solo for exp by throwing shrukiens and kite). So... what exactly do we get in return, Monks get mend, feign death and high damage, rogues get higher damage and SoS, Yet everyone pretty much knows Caster damage kicks melee in pretty high in the testicles. Not even ganna get into how fucked up Solo power is Caster vs. Melee, Caster can quad kite Fire and tables, melee try the same hes dead in about 10seconds.<br />
<br />
Yet i really think warriors get screwed the most, high tanking ability, so with high end gear can take dmg fairly well compared to a monk, even with their mend key (better than). But aggro wise they suck, just outright im ganna state, Warriors Suck at maintaining aggro. Being melee haveing warrior tank a high end mob Snare glands, forlon totem/scepter. Yea it works, most of the time, can steal aggro still, and occaisionly will. In exp grp's like Ldon adventures (group) haveing a warrior tank is just a waste of time, and dps, might as well take a lil dmg and get done with the mission faster than wait for warrior to tank every mob, in fact i PREFER to have knight tanks when i go on adventures.<br />
<br />
But i think with full end gear, and stuff, a Knight should be able to tank these things, BUT i think a Warrior with the same gear should make it so much easier, that either slows down CH rot, or doesnt need vie, or something I dont know..... But there should be a trade off of somekind when it comes to warrior tanking. And definatly a trade off for melee solo ability's, which is non exsistant compared to caster solo ability's<br />
<br />
edit about solo: yea im talking about equal geared melee vs. caster, heck even Worse geared casters can solo better than a godly geared pure melee</div></div><hr />

For those keeping score, it was the only 'advantage' we had over knights.  A small one at that, since most CH chains are geared for non-disced healing anyway.<br />
<br />
It doesn't matter that it's 'just one guy'.  Pretty soon it will be 2, then three, and guess what?  If they can get it, PEOPLE WILL WANT A PALADIN ON THAT MOB.  If a Paladin CAN tank it, they will be hands-down the Number One choice.  Why?  Because of all the other bullshit they bring to the table. <br />
<br />
They had the agro control, they got the utility, and now they have the mitigation.  We have...uhh....the DPS.  Sometimes.  The rout is complete.  We have lost.  And fuck you knights for coming here and playing it off as nothing special.<br />
<br />
I'm a pretty calm guy, but I'm ready to take a baseball bat to someone's windshield right about now.  It's taking all my self-restraint not to order all guild warriors to change mains to wizards/rogues/clerics, and demand that we recruit 8 more paladins.</div></div><hr />

Bullshit Phantron. <br />
<br />
Edit: Let me qualify this - A paladin tanking Quarm and living signifies the end of everything Warrior. It takes a big yellow high-lighter and makes a nice fat mark on how FUCKED UP itemization is, how fucked up class balance is, and how fucked up Everquest is... have you ever tanked Quarm? Out of defensive? The fact that a Paladin could live through an entire fight and take every hit, slowed or not, should tell you a whole lot. <br />
<br />
And if you actually believe that a Knight cannot tank every mob in Time you're delusional. Any mob a Warrior can tank out of /disc for any extended period of time (read: EVERY MOB), a Knight can also tank. Not being able to understand this is your problem.  <br />
<br />
I have tanked Quarm.  I am sure a high end Knight with LDoN augments has my HPs (heck I only have 600 more than my guild's top knight) and they certainly have more AC (since they can always use a shield).  I didn't tank Quarm the whole time but it didn't look like it would've taken a miracle for me to survive the entire duration so of course I'm not at all surprised a top Knight can do it.  Yes I know you spend a good deal of Quarm fight without disc... that is exactly why I'm not surprised.  Anything that's tanked in undisced for a long time is a prime candidate for a Knight to tank.  <br />
<br />
I'm indifferent to a Knight tanking Quarm because I knew it's going to happen sooner or later.  I do not think this is right at all.<br />
<br />
I didn't say I don't think Knights can tank the gods in Time.  I just haven't heard of anyone saying that yet, and I think some other gods would be a more impressive test of a Knight's ability to withstand prolonged melee damage.  I don't doubt that a Knight can tank any god in Time at all.  I have tanked all except Cazic Thule (for obvious reasons) and I know there isn't anything special about my HP/AC that a Knight cannot come close or even surpass.  <br />
<br />
Maybe you should be angry that a Knight can tank Time ubers, but to be surprised?  No way.  Impressed?  Why be impressed with the truth?  Do you seriously not saw this coming?  I remember you said you were going to take Knights to destroy gods in PoTime to show bad the itemization has become, and I fully believed you can do it.  So why the outrage over something you know that can be done?<br />
<br />
Edit:  Just checked the profile, when factoring in Aura of Crusader this Paladin would probably have 300 more HP than I do.  If there's someone who shouldn't be able to tank Quarm it's me not the Paladin.  <br />
<br />
Is this itemization remotely balanced?  Of course not.  But the result sure isn't surprising at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>Kavak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">One question for those who say there is nothing wrong with this:-<br />
<br />
After seeing 2 monks tank Fennin Ro and a Paladin tank Quarm, all on warrior healing rotations, do you feel that warriors getting an aggro on demand upgrade is still going to trivialise the game?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">Warrior snap aggro on a mob that a Knight can tank would be completely pointless because going from second-best to second-best is not doing anything at all.<br />
<br />
Hereby lies the problem of the discussions.  People do not understand what kind of fixes are needed for what kind of situations.  Anything a Knight can tank, they're automatically the best at it, barring some very unlikely changes like changing kick to Enraging Blow.  It really doesn't matter what cool taunt fix you can think of.  If it's not game-breaking, Knights are still better.  But even if it is game-breaking, that only makes the choice of a warrior tank versus a Knight tank an indifferent one.  In non raid situations, Knights would still be better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>Kavak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">Heh my point actually was that this is making the game trivial, the main reason so many were vehemently against warrior snap aggro, but are seeminly fine with this.<br />
<br />
<br />
Personally I know its already beyond that point right now where just snap aggro is not going to make all of the warrior problems go away. Because a class that can take hits almost as well as us and well enough in relation to the mobs in this game up to the hardest hitters without defensive already has snap aggro and a lot more utility than we do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">I'm of the opinion that Knight tanking already trivializes the game and trivalizing the game further does not solve anything.  Besides, it still wouldn't matter for us.  If tanking with Warrior and Knights are both trivial, then you'd merely be indifferent.  Sure the Warrior still has more HPs, but if neither characters are expected to die, does it really matter?  In XP groups, we would still be inferior.  We both have trivially good aggros, but Knights still have their spells and we do not.<br />
<br />
I'd rather not break the game further when it's not even going to help my class.  That's why I think Warriors are fine and do not need fixes.  We function fine within how the game OUGHT to be played.  There are the Knights that are clearly broken, and since breaking us still doesn't make us better than the Knights like we're supposed to, might as well keep what few integrity this game still has.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u70"><b>Kavak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p70">I do not really care about warrior fixes at the moment, my question is not asking for any fixes, I thought it was pretty clear what I was asking about.<br />
<br />
If you think a Paladin tanking Quarm at this stage is messed up good for you, I agree, pull up a seat  and let those who and I quote myself  &quot; for those who say there is nothing wrong with this:-&quot;<br />
answer my question.<br />
<br />
<br />
edit:- I am almost in 100% agreement with you as well on actual warrior issues Phant. I too feel warriors actually are pretty fine when it comes to the actual game itself. I quit though because the one thing I really would not accept was being a second fiddle tank anywhere when that was the only thing we did. <br />
<br />
I have not played my warrior since August because I feel that even if they fix us I am not sure I would want to play the class that may be dubbed down. Its kind of way too late for a justifable nerf (who wants to be cripple nerfed anyway? I blame SOE for implementation not knights for not wanting a nerf, no one does). That coupled with fatigue of the high end mass farming put me off the class a while.<br />
<br />
I still enjoy posting here though and talking about these issues. My question was mainly to make those people who see this as acceptable to think a bit about it and how the trivialise argument was used before. Anyway thats where I am coming from.</div></div><hr />

Mastered is probably too strong of a word, I mean something more like the stage before mastery, but after your fairly confortable with the encounter, IE have farmed it Several Several Times, Perhaps someone from AO could post what they think their level on Quarm is. <br />
<br />
Well...  Aside from yesterday our typical time clearing, from start to finish, has been around 5 hours and change (5 &amp; 9 mins I believe, most recently).  Yesterday was sort of suck mode and we took way longer than normal (by like several hours even), call it bad luck, knowing what we were leading up to, bad support (thanks matrix) or hell just dumb mistakes like me training, err pulling part of phase 3 with my twink, etc...<br />
<br />
With rotating defensive tanks Quarm kills were pretty much flawless after the initial first kill.  Three kills ago we decided to go from alternating defensive warriors to having Tana just tank from start to finish.  The first time we tried it, well let's just say he didn't make it from start to finish but he has a much spammier DI hotkey now.  The next time he lived the entire fight and the very next time so did Nomi...<br />
<br />
That's where we stand, you can judge our level from that, I'd rather not.<br />
<br />
Someone asked me why we did this...  I can only speak for what motivated me to see it through.<br />
<br />
What was done shouldn't be possible and it's pretty sad that we could do it.  You can say LDoN is the latest expansion but you know as well as I and everyone else that you're full of shit for saying it.  Thing is, I'm pretty sure Nomi could have done it without BoV, he basically tanks the same as Tana when disc is up and it's not like defensive lasts an entire fight.  I was a part of it b/c I honestly believe Warriors need to be improved and really Knights need to be balanced better compared to our Warriors.  Overall I think we did a good thing, I can only hope that some good will come of it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">The reason why I asked if &quot;Vie = defensive&quot; is that their page mentions they used the same healing strategy.  Unless that Warrior is purposely not doing Defensive then Quarm attacks such that it doesn't matter what tank you stick out there.  Whether or not they Defensive seems irrelevant.  Would it be news if a Warrior survived Quarm without using Defensive?<br />
<br />
Anyhow, I'm kind of fuzzy on what the extra stuff Quarm does so correct me if I'm wrong.  If it shouldn't be possible for a Knight to tank Quarm then why doesn't Quarm do more melee damage?  That is the only way to differentiate Warriors from Knights in tankability.  Thanks to SOE (actions and inactions) that is the claim to fame.<br />
<br />
One of the big things that kills Warrior effectiveness is magical damage.  &quot;/disc defensive&quot; can not make that go away.  Once you get monsters that toss more magical damage than melee damage /disc defensive is marginalized.  You can place any tank out there and get just as effective results.<br />
<br />
So what does Quarm do that is not /disc defensive-able?<br />
<br />
As for elemental gear, the major parts seem to make sense.  It contains everything a top of the line Paladin would seek out anyway.  Its the auxilary parts that are all messed up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u73"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p73">I'm afraid you don't understand Aeka.<br />
<br />
Defensive only lasts a few minutes. After it's gone the only differences between a Warrior and a Paladin are a Warrior's &quot;superior&quot; survivability and a Paladin's spells.<br />
<br />
Paladin's are labeling this as the natural consequence of mudflation in an attempt to give the impression that it affects all classes equally. But it doesn't. It's not mudflation, it's a Class Balance issue.<br />
<br />
As a reaction to the &quot;Holy Trinity&quot; the developers decided no class should dominate a slot in an experiance group or raid. Cleric, Enchanter and Warrior domination of the Healer, Slower, and Tank roles was to be shared.<br />
<br />
Paladin survivability was improved by giving them almost everything Warriors recieved as new expansions came out. Plate/All items while not eroding the innate Warrior HP advantage diluted the percentage. Add to this 15 or so useful spells, mana from Plate/All items, and FT - Paladins have come a long way.<br />
<br />
But this is not mudflation. Warriors got almost nothing that other plates classes didn't get. This was an overadjustment due I think because developers were shocked how badly Kunark treated Knights, a prediliction for Knights, and caster enhancement.<br />
<br />
This neglect of Warriors while boosting Paladins consistantly for over a year put us where we are.<br />
<br />
Paladins are Warriors with very nice spellbooks that enhance their ability to tank and have given then preference as experiance group tanks. They can tank any mob in the game.<br />
<br />
Warriors are no longer needed. We are inferior experiance group tanks and our only real raid role can be performed by others. The class could be deleted and the game would not skip a beat. Warriors are agast and disheartened. Paladins and the developers see this as a natural consequence of insuring no class dominates a role.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't worry about a Paladin nerf. This is what the developers want - the Warrior 1 year reverse nerf project is complete (I hope). Is it any wonder SoE didn't want to discuss Class Balance at FanFair?<br />

Need is relative...  If the Paladin can tank Quarm, then yes the Warrior can tank Quarm with no defensive disc (as balance is now they are both the same thing).  Not having defensive just means things have to go right, defensive allows for mistakes.  Assuming nobody screws up you don't &quot;need&quot; defensive.  Assuming people can anticipate you don't &quot;need&quot; defensive.  That being said, Quarm can still one round either of them so you do need a bit of luck too.</div></div><hr />

Knights are supposed to be SECOND CLASS TANKS by a large margin - large enough that the the difference in tanking abilities is equal in value to the sum of all knight abilities not shared by warriors.<br />

It seems Knights now share the dubious honor with pre-nerf monks of being completely delusional about their own role in this game, the roles you are destroying, and the class balance of the entire goddam game.<br />

Since that isn't the case, you can't claim this is simply &quot;mudflation&quot; and not an example of how messed up &quot;class balance&quot; is.<br />
<br />
When the game evolves and allows hybrids to take over the only job of pure warriors (tanking mobs that would be impossible without a warrior), without giving the warriors something in return, then that is not mudflation, it is imbalance.<br />

I understand if you dont want to hear it (it IS in fact saddening and sickening that a paladin tanked Quarm), however the time WILL come when other classes will tank Quarm, its not just paladins, but as for now in this case with Quarm it is.  As others said, the paladin who tanked him had only ONE piece of gear that was paladin only, meaning that other classes could use most of his gear (isnt this mudflation?).  <br />
<br />
    Im just waiting for another class to tank him to get this &quot;OMG NERF XXXX class!&quot; bandwagon going as its not just a paladin that will tank end game bosses, soon will be SKs, monks, etc, whatever the uberguild has in their minds to suit their fancies<br />
<br />
i am well aware warriors have not progressed as much as &lt;insert class here&gt; and I know that sucks, my point is that while you focus to bash on the paladin class, its not just them but several other classes as well.  Could you not imagine an SK tanking Quarm?  Better agro, similar HPs / AC, more dps etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u91"><b>Kether</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p91">After seeing 2 monks tank Fennin Ro and a Paladin tank Quarm, all on warrior healing rotations <br />
<br />
That's a misleading statement.  In an attempt to make things harder for the 'ubers' they have increased mob dps to the point where a &quot;healing rotation&quot; = 1 CH per mob round.  Tank HP, discs, etc at no time causes you to say /rs Clerics slow to 1 CH per 2 mob rounds.  This is unlike the Velious and Luclin days when you would do (for example) 5s CHs when disc was up, and 3s when it wasn't.<br />
<br />
Thats 8925hp per round being healed on the tank.  It doesn't matter whether it is a warrior, a knight, a monk, or a druid.<br />
<br />
The paladin had (via aug mudflation) a grand total of 69 less hp than the absolute maximum possible for him in PoP.  He has 14/20 slots with max hp possible items.  To be at that pre-LDoN he would have needed to upgrade even  more items.  <br />
<br />
They were using BoV which is another source of mudflation.  <br />
<br />
Mudflation can occur in forms other than store-bought, 'full raid' expansions.<br />
<br />
Could he have tanked it with those extra 69 hp and BoV?  Maybe.<br />
<br />
Does that mean warriors are out of a job?  No, of course not.  For the vast majority of guilds warriors are not only 'nice' but are irreplaceable in the defeat of challenging opponents.<br />
<br />
Does this act 'prove' they are inbalanced?  No.<br />
<br />
Would tuning Quarm so that it requires a defensive rotation, makes his max &gt;possible knight hp+bov, him DTing any knight within 100 feet, or any other scheme to ASSURE he is only tanked by warriors in the next 6 months be an instant balance?  No, of course not.<br />
<br />
If you can reach an itemization/encounter point where knights are preferred in the majority of time over warriors for main-tanking on raids that are challenging to you is that balanced?  No, it isn't.<br />
<br />
The crux here, and it is a BIG ONE is this question:<br />
<br />
To what degree, if any, do you want to make content be  IMPOSSIBLE without class X fullfilling a primary role that is shared by another class?<br />
<br />
IF the above is yes, then in a game that by current design heavily encourages a full and rounded group for any notable reward with by far the best rewards being derived from raids HOW do you balance X?<br />

Could you not imagine an SK tanking Quarm?  Better agro, similar HPs / AC, more dps etc.  <br />
<br />
Yes I can and one probably will...  As soon as he gets enough upgrades to make up for the additional 227 hps that a paladin gets in buffs over and above any of the other classes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Fact 1 : programmer time would rather be spent on next expansion to bring revenue, so the fix need to be easy and cheap. Which mean it should not require modifcation of encounters or modification of itemization.<br />
<br />
Fact 2 : the fix shouldn't trivialize content and shouldn't affect AE dmg.<br />
<br />
Fact 3 : 3 out of 15 Quarm loot is All/All and various itemization has brough caster HP/AC to 70% of warrior lvl, while knights are 95% and above.<br />
<br />
Fact 4 : only Warrior should be able to tank quarm at this point in time. Encounter that are design to be tanked by knights already have slow that make warrior unable to have aggro.<br />
<br />
HOW TO FIX THIS<br />
<br />
Either have quarm and all potime boss mob designed to be tanked by warrior have mana DD/DoT.<br />
<br />
-OR-<br />
<br />
Innate mitigation modifier for each class.<br />
<br />
Warrior lose discipline advantage and get 130% permanent mitigation which is similar and would make us better choice for xp group that rely on ranger, pally, BL, etc healing (yes that's pathetic).<br />
<br />
knights get nerfed to 80% mitigation, they shouldn't tank quarm end of story. Would make some encounter design for them harder, oh well those should be relatively a small number of encounter and you can reduce dmg output of the mob accordingly.<br />
<br />
caster get nerfed to 50% mitigation, making them receive twice melee dmg.... about time they learn to avoid stealing aggro. yet would not affect AE dmg. Hopefully they would die a few more times trying to solo... who cares, i don't know any warrior able to tank for xp.</div></div><hr />

In an attempt to make things harder for the 'ubers' they have increased mob dps to the point where a &quot;healing rotation&quot; = 1 CH per mob round. Tank HP, discs, etc at no time causes you to say /rs Clerics slow to 1 CH per 2 mob rounds. This is unlike the Velious and Luclin days when you would do (for example) 5s CHs when disc was up, and 3s when it wasn't.<br />

Thats 8925hp per round being healed on the tank. It doesn't matter whether it is a warrior, a knight, a monk, or a druid.&quot;<br />

<br />
And that if you do not see it as messed up or overpowered, how on Gods green earth could so many  before see that an aggro upgrade to warriors would break the game (not that I personally am saying warriors should now get aggro lock). I was pointing out the hypocrisy and changing of the guard arguments.<br />
<br />
I see a lot of people trying to &quot;educate&quot; us warriors  by merely stating how the tanking game works, justifying one person tanking by saying &quot;Well the tanking setup right now allows it&quot;. No shit it does, its obvious, warriors have been saying this for a while (like Phant said earlier). <br />
<br />
What I was complaining about was that it was &quot;apparently not obvious&quot; to these other classes until someone had to go out of there way and show them and everyone else proof that it could be done. Now all I see is a lot of &quot;well duh of course it can be done&quot; to try and sweep the actual issue under the rug.  <br />

No one seems to question why the supposedly mightiest monster in the game does not require &quot;something else&quot; to kill.  If all you needed to do is stick someone with 10K HP in front of it, then are you sure you want to make Quarm the postboy for &quot;things tankable only by a Warrior?&quot;.

<br />
I know this, I agree with this. My point is the entire tanking game is messed up because they can spam heal like this (IE  things like 0 second CH rotations) at such a fast rate that mobs practically have to 1 round you. But at the same time its  needed because some mobs hit so hard.  If the guild uses a 0 second rotation for warriors, I assume its for safety spikes as well as they just have the mana for it.<br />

<br />
<br />
There was a parse released right after the monk tanked FR from AO, the migitation with BOV on the monk was close to identical to the warrior who did not have Vie but used defensive when it popped.

0 sec CH is not used on quarm.  FR vs. Monks isn't really relavant here but to answer why...  We just always have and never stopped, thus why we refer to it as &quot;Fennin chain&quot; even if we use it elsewhere.</div></div><hr />

Not if SoE made good on the representations it made to Warriors and Paladins in the Class Descriptions.<br />
<br />
Most of us are not in favor of nerfing Knights. However we are in favor of Class Balance.<br />
<br />
Since Warriors should be unmatched in their to survive the most brutal battles, take away Defensive and give us a permanent 25% mitigation boost and 30% more HP's. That's where we should be in the first place.<br />
<br />
Since no Tank should exceed a Warrior's ability to make themselves the focus of all their enemies' attacks, give Warriors snap aggro on demand and ranged aggro.<br />
<br />
Uncouple some of the disciplines and shorten their refresh dramaticly to add a fun factor and some flexability.<br />
<br />
Then after adjusting how hard some mobs hit things will be right.<br />
<br />
No one needs to be nerfed. Warriors need to be fixed.<br />

Basically what it boils down to is, should a warrior have such an advantage in tanking ability, that no other class can reach the baseline plateu it takes to tank something, given the upgrades that are achieved through farming the zone?  <br />
<br />
YES!!!!!<br />
<br />
<br />
You are a fucking moron....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u112"><b>Kether</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p112">Liz, I never said that.  And believe it or not, a geared/AA druid can take the place of a cleric in MANY rotations.<br />
<br />
<br />
Kavak, my statement regarding the CH rotation may have appeared 'obvious' but the mere fact that people were mentioning it was the same as somehow surprising and relevent to the discussion indicated otherwise.  I personally do not know what Quarm hits for nor its attack rate.  There have been times when I have had to coordinate multiple heals per turn (for example a dru taking the place of a downed cleric with a shaman patching to land their heal the same second the druid one hits on an early and low cleric Reparm in our early fire days) but its problematic, rarely necessary, and I don't believe the default healing mode used by most.  The reason why the healing can't change much between them is a matter of ratios.  When mobs hit such that you could heal every 3 rounds with disc and 2 rounds without it and mana WAS a constant concern you could (and I did) make such alterations to healing timing.  The problem comes with how fast these heals need to be.  As of now (and especially with proc mobs) a disc doesn't change the healing pattern, it simply make it less susceptible to failure from errors.  This IS an important consideration, but not one that clearly shows up.  You would basically need the full log of the person involved and do a monte carlo simulation of variances in the healing pattern and mob dps and see what if any relative difference would result in paladin and warrior survivability.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
IF the answer to the above question is 'no' then class X should never be outright needed directly implying that given sufficient healing force a knight should be able to tank any mob (using the tank scenario).  With less survivability, but it should be possible.  IF that is the case then Knight LDoN raid 'necessity' should go as well.<br />
<br />
IF the answer is 'yes' then we reach a dilemma.<br />
<br />
Saying that class Y (which is virtually never 'needed') can cast spells isn't sufficient for balance.  Spells are simply tools that may or may not be effective in a given environment.  Neither is soloing unless said soloing would actually be a method of replacing a group (the minimum level that real 'rewards' are obtained).  It isn't.  Knights can not kill anything that can't be melee 2-boxed.<br />
<br />
The tanking dilemma is thus:<br />
<br />
1. Mobs take 1 or 2 tanks.  No more without (5) below<br />
2. Aggro is either a significant problem, or it is not.<br />
3. Mana is rarely a problem.<br />
4. Heals are landed for every X round(s) (usually 1, but on lesser targets 2 would work).<br />
5. IF itemization is to be meaningful that necessitates that Y will do what X had previously done UNLESS their is some artificial constraint is engineered to prevent it.  IF said is done then it will for the forseeable future MANDATE class X for success with no substitution possible.<br />
<br />
<br />
So it comes down to whether SOE wants X to be completely irreplaceable even with a class Y at (or beyond) the zenith of what is possible in that content.<br />
<br />
In this case X being warriors.<br />
<br />
Look at the tank factors:<br />
<br />
Aggro<br />
HP<br />
Mitigation<br />
Avoidance<br />
Disciplines<br />
<br />
I am going to state a premise here that Knight's primary role in XP groups is tanking and their primary raid role is Add-Tanking.  That is a premise I believe stands on firm ground from the last 2+ years of game expansions and changes.<br />
<br />
Of those 5, 4 are constantly available.  The fifth is intermittently available.  Four of the 5 are in favor of warriors.  Aggro is the only one in favor of knights.  Only aggro has an effective limit (i.e. beyond a certain amount it makes not a little, but in fact 0 difference), the others are beneficial without bounds.<br />
<br />
It is my conjecture that knight aggro (range and snap) needs to remain not simply incrementally better, but superior than warriors to maintain the AT roll.  Doing otherwise would place them into the &quot;when we don't have enough X&quot; roll that no class should fall into.<br />
<br />
There is NO SUCH THING as 'balance' outside of the context of content. <br />
<br />
HOW do we 'fix' this?<br />
<br />
By far the easiest way is to use (with possible modifications) the existing disciplines with tuning to some encouters.  (I have NOT done a LDoN raid, so take the suggestions therein as general game-play knowledge of add events extened to the difficulties posted without knight tanking).<br />
<br />
1.  Lower the DB, raise the DI on PoT boss mobs.  This would make mobs much more survivable with disciplines to the point where you couldn't tank them without it.  It would ALSO help prevent the 'one Uber warrior' wagon ride to glory.  You know, the guilds where 1 war has 500 more hp than anyone else.  There are guilds like this (even though, surprise... they often explode).  This also GREATLY raises the threshold for non-warriors being able to tank those mobs that are 'reasonably current'.  Some encounters may require additional tuning to accomodate MT transitions.<br />
<br />
2.  Reduce the sick number of mobs and the needed kill rate in LDoN raids.  On multiple pulls it is generally the cross aggro healing aggro that kills the healers (the other primary cause is a patch heal being cast too soon, but this is largely avoidable with skill).  By altering the number of mobs per pull and their DI as it relates to their total damage you can create a scenario that:<br />
a.  Damn near requires /disc warriors to MT the named creatures (not simply the final boss).<br />
b.  Sustains the value of knight ATs, although it is an edge instead of the absolute irreplaceability of a war as MT.<br />
<br />
3.  I would separate disc timers into offensive and defensive categories.  Using aggressive would not alter the ability to use defensive.  However I would NOT seperate all of them, or make then permanently usable.  Allowing perma disciples destroys warrior stackability.<br />
<br />
4.  If the all/all loot is to remain their should be further stratification of hp.  No, this shouldn't be some ridiculous 20% edge.  But it should remain a larger factor than what I is atm at max possible HP level.  Warriors should get a PoP class AA with that grants a 3% hp boost.  That would place pal hp at just above/below 92% of warriors fully buffed depending on paladin selection of gear in regards to spell foci.<br />
<br />
5, I would be VERY leary about some form of 'tagro' for warriors without extensive testing.  ONLY times when pulls must be faster than the raids ae taunt recycle time is it necessary and if is too much it would threaten the knight AT role.  The addition of dwing LDoN aggro procs also raises the question where you trivialize aggro and do so for the tank with the highest mitigation, avoidance, and disc.  This is already the case in most simple pulls, it need not be done further.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
There you go.  Warrior MT irreplaceable raid role preserved.  You would be FAR more irreplaceable than clerics (in theory you could double up a druid rotation, but all non-war being shortly 1-rounded would not be replaceable).<br />
<br />
What I wonder, I TRULY wonder is...<br />
<br />
Is that what you want?<br />
<br />
If so, I don't see the current XP situation as necessarily unbalanced in the overall context.  Being less-efficient while certainly workable in an XP setting doesn't seem that bad for the benefit of being an irreplaceable raid God.</div></div><hr />

I have tanked Quarm.  I am sure a high end Knight with LDoN augments has my HPs (heck I only have 600 more than my guild's top knight) and they certainly have more AC (since they can always use a shield).  I didn't tank Quarm the whole time but it didn't look like it would've taken a miracle for me to survive the entire duration so of course I'm not at all surprised a top Knight can do it.  Yes I know you spend a good deal of Quarm fight without disc... that is exactly why I'm not surprised.  Anything that's tanked in undisced for a long time is a prime candidate for a Knight to tank.  <br />
<br />
I'm indifferent to a Knight tanking Quarm because I knew it's going to happen sooner or later.  I do not think this is right at all.<br />
<br />
I didn't say I don't think Knights can tank the gods in Time.  I just haven't heard of anyone saying that yet, and I think some other gods would be a more impressive test of a Knight's ability to withstand prolonged melee damage.  I don't doubt that a Knight can tank any god in Time at all.  I have tanked all except Cazic Thule (for obvious reasons) and I know there isn't anything special about my HP/AC that a Knight cannot come close or even surpass.  <br />
<br />
Maybe you should be angry that a Knight can tank Time ubers, but to be surprised?  No way.  Impressed?  Why be impressed with the truth?  Do you seriously not saw this coming?  I remember you said you were going to take Knights to destroy gods in PoTime to show bad the itemization has become, and I fully believed you can do it.  So why the outrage over something you know that can be done?<br />
<br />
Edit:  Just checked the profile, when factoring in Aura of Crusader this Paladin would probably have 300 more HP than I do.  If there's someone who shouldn't be able to tank Quarm it's me not the Paladin.  <br />
<br />
Is this itemization remotely balanced?  Of course not.  But the result sure isn't surprising at all.  <br />
<br />
I saw this coming. Look at my post history. I complained about Vie, I complained about Shielding mods and Hybrids, I complained about itemization completely screwing warriors. If anyone saw this coming, it was me. That doesn't mean I have to like it...<br />
<br />
LDoN augments also shouldn't come into this argument at all. Without the items to actually Augment in the first place, it wouldn't be an issue. If Paladins and Shadowknights were actually properly balanced and gear itemization was properly balanced, they wouldn't be Augmenting the best armor and wearable items in the game because chances would have been great that they wouldn't have had ACCESS to them in the first place.<br />
<br />
This is a disease, a sickness, and it's spreading. I've been told that within a 'couple of weeks,' some changes are coming for Warriors. I have to ask myself, however, what possible changes/upgrades could they ever make that would put us on even footing with Knights? Warriors with 3k ac and 15k hps? I just don't see it happening. I see a gimmick or two being thrown our way and that's probably about it...<br />
<br />
It's so many things that have accumulated that make this such a bitter pill to swallow. So many upgrades that came in for Knights. All penalties removed and even bonuses implemented. Massive mudflation that doesn't just work in favor of Knights, it actually works AGAINST warriors. Hasn't anyone ever thought how ridiculous it is that we are still penalized when we use /disc Defensive, /disc Evasive, /disc Aggressive, penalties that were implemented in Kunark, yet Knights had all of their penalties removed?<br />
<br />
Now we have people saying, &quot;Well, I won't be surprised until a Knight tanks RZ or TZ or VZ!&quot; Yea, take the crumbs the Knights leave behind. &quot;Roll out the warrior bot, we are going to tackle RZ!&quot; Their are 8 Gods + Quarm in the Plane of Time and now Warriors are reduced to being 'required' for 3 (and that is arguable considering most people 1 tank TZ and VZ flawlessly, any Knight could do the same)? Don't you people see what this means? <br />

Warrior snap aggro on a mob that a Knight can tank would be completely pointless because going from second-best to second-best is not doing anything at all.<br />
<br />
Hereby lies the problem of the discussions.  People do not understand what kind of fixes are needed for what kind of situations.  Anything a Knight can tank, they're automatically the best at it, barring some very unlikely changes like changing kick to Enraging Blow.  It really doesn't matter what cool taunt fix you can think of.  If it's not game-breaking, Knights are still better.  But even if it is game-breaking, that only makes the choice of a warrior tank versus a Knight tank an indifferent one.  In non raid situations, Knights would still be better.  <br />
<br />
Exactly right.<br />

Which is why I am all for a Knight nerf. What it would require to balance a Warrior with a Knight to make them 'desirable' would cripple the game (moreso than it already is).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u120"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p120">Look at the tank factors:<br />
<br />
Aggro<br />
HP<br />
Mitigation<br />
Avoidance<br />
Disciplines<br />
<br />
 Aggro is clearly in favor of the Knight. There is also no upper limit to how much aggro you can gain or hold, by the way.<br />
<br />
 HP is a wash, as post after post has proven.<br />
<br />
 Mitigation is also a wash, as post after post has proven.<br />
<br />
 Avoidance is in favor of the Warrior, but not by a significant amount, and it DOES have a cap (You can't go past max skill level without select gear pieces)<br />
<br />
 Disciplines are in favor of the Warrior as long as they are active. If they are inactive, they are a non factor.<br />
<br />
 The 'problem' is, all the Paladin arguments in favor of boosting Hybrids have gone away over this time. The pins have been kicked out from under the HP argument, the mitigation argument, and have defanged the avoidance argument. The last remaining stronghold of argument left was /disc defensive. Since it has obviously now been made obsolete, that last argument is gone.<br />
<br />
 Congratulations, Paladins, you finally became Warriors, and you got to keep your spellbooks.<br />
<br />
 Enjoy it while it lasts, because I'm waiting to see whether they make us gods or nerf you back to the Stone Age.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u121"><b>BigAlFoxTrot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p121">&quot;If so, I don't see the current XP situation as necessarily unbalanced in the overall context. Being less-efficient while certainly workable in an XP setting doesn't seem that bad for the benefit of being an irreplaceable raid God.&quot;<br />
<br />
That is the same old &quot;raid want + xp group want = total want&quot; so we are balanced bullshit that your brand of Pally tries to sell.<br />
<br />
Now you see that you are not only able to provide your traditional raid duties (group heals, tanking adds) but you can tank boss mobs.  So now that you can tank the boss mobs Kether, I want all your spells.  Then we are balanced see ?  <br />
<br />
Oh and fuck you for xp groups,  you shouldn't have any because a Pally tanked Quarm.  Wow, I love this Pally balancing logic.  IT's great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u122"><b>Kether</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p122">So anything 2 melee can do, one knight can do?  And knights sure as heck can do things 2 melee cannot. If you are a knight class and know how to play it, you would know this. <br />
<br />
The question is relevent.  I never stated that the warrior duo partner would also be a 'melee', but neither did I outright state that it wasn't.  I should have been more clear.  Possible gains from solo/duoing have continually diminished to the point of near (but not of course, total) worthlessness.  In the very rare occasion that something could crop up (really stetching for an example here) worth a paladin soloing that he could solo a warrior could easily duo with any reasonably complimentary class.  Not any class of course.  I have on numerous occasions advocated closing these differentials by suggesting that if kei can last 4 hours, so should haste and regen, that melee should have higher innate hp regen and/or better bandage options (this has happened somewhat) and that there is no reason for paladins to possess the cleric hp buff line (hero/bof/marzin) nor anything greater than a 50% rez (and that druids should gain a 75% one).<br />
<br />
In closing I will simply state that I have always thought there should be more parity among all classes across the spectrum of activities.  I honestly think 'needing X' to fill one role is generally bad for the game and that the game as a whole would be better if everyone was 'wanted' but never 'needed'.<br />
<br />
Thats why even though I proposed a list of warriors could have done to be 'needed' I would hope it wouldn't happen.  Instead I would hope they have more reasons to 'want' them and less to need them.  The same would apply with 'needing' knights.  This is because I can't think of anything to balance an absolute need on the most important content throughout an entire career except a rather notable 'unwant' in most if not every other setting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u123"><b>Kaldanm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p123">Basically this pally tanked quarm with the same healing setting of a warrior with just the vie spell added.

It is not. added to shield mods and itemisation screwed it is not. <br />
I think Vie must be modified in some way too. Improve aggro, change the way it work, increase recast time, etc...<br />
<br />
<br />
for the balance issue, I would really like to see an official post of absor (or on eqlive) telling us : &quot;ok, THIS is what we are going to next patch...&quot;.<br />
A very long post. With lots of changes.<br />
I'm really tired of waiting, caster fix after caster fix... now the next expansion is almost announced (or another wayfarer camp, who knows), and just like LDoN, they will AGAIN add new spells because its just adding new lines in the spell file, it's easy to do compared to real balance work.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then suck it up because, much as you like to disagree, you still get groups without an absolute 'need' for your secondary stuff, you would still be a good choice for tank with no warrior present, I see your 'useless' utility being used in groups daily and you cannot expect to be so equal in tanking whilst concurrently having so many other additional benefits and abilities beyond an average joe warrior.<br />
<br />
End of the day i'm afraid, that's it. You want to tank like a warrior - PLAY a warrior. I doubt you would consider the trade off equitable.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u128"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p128">Ok I actually read all this (except the dissertation).  It seems to me that we are now seeing the &quot;perfect storm&quot; of bad design elements coming together:<br />
<br />
Take these questionable decisions (given roughly in the order they appeared):<br />
<br />
1) Disc defensive<br />
(+)<br />
2) Complete Heal<br />
(+)<br />
3) Uni-Sex Itemization<br />
(+)<br />
4) &quot;Snap&quot; agro<br />
(+)<br />
5) Vie<br />
(+)<br />
6) persistant &quot;mudflation&quot; (the idea that synergies of previous abilities add up to a great deal more than they should)<br />
<br />
= Current State<br />
<br />
Folks: what we have here is an overall class to class role design that has mutated horribly out of control.  One or more of these underpinnings will have to be kicked out to restore some balance.<br />
<br />
But to restore balnce you must first agree on the strategic role of each class.  Any other class tanking &quot;bellweather&quot; mobs like quarm clearly shows that the current roster of SoE designers<br />
<br />
1) Doesn't think warriors have the &quot;must have to tank top end mobs&quot;<br />
or<br />
2) Can't see the macro/synergistic effects of their design decisions <br />
<br />
All in all I think this just shows the game is running out of steam...akin to being painted into a corner IRL.<br />
<br />
Bold steps can change this.  However, a corporation with a cash cow is not going to take bold steps.  They are going to focus on incremental carrots (compounding the bad design issues).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u131"><b>Couching</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p131">There was a parse released right after the monk tanked FR from AO, the migitation with BOV on the monk was close to identical to the warrior who did not have Vie but used defensive when it popped. Sorry my bad I just assumed everyone knew this. So even that angle does not fly IMO. <br />
<br />
I guess the test you refered is this:<br />
<br />
Vabtoo (AO monk) vs Fennin Ro<br />
<br />
AC this fight: 1930 approx.<br />
Fight Date: Oct 27<br />
Fight Duration: 434 seconds<br />
Total Damage Taken: 507840<br />
Max Hit Taken: 2430<br />
Min Hit Taken: 865<br />
Avg Hit Taken: 1295.51<br />
DPS Taken: 1172.84<br />
<br />
Tanamar (AO warrior) vs Fennin Ro<br />
<br />
AC this fight: 2225<br />
Fight Date: Oct 24<br />
Fight Duration: 798 seconds<br />
Total Damage Taken: 990766<br />
Max Hit Taken: 2700<br />
Min Hit Taken: 73<br />
Avg Hit Taken: 1171.12<br />
DPS Taken: 1241.56<br />
<br />
From the data, Tana has defensive up in the 45% time of the fight. Even though, Vabtoo with BoV took 10% more (124/1171) than Tanamar. I would not make the conclusion that Monk with BoV has similar mitigation as War with defensive. <br />
<br />
Seriously, I am interested in war with BoV in the whole fight. I think War with bov &gt; War with defensive in a long duration fight.<br />
<br />
Back to the topic, I would like SoE to nerf BoV so that defensive/evasive will not be obsolete.</div></div><hr />

Of course he's using BoV, judging by his hp bar I honestly think he could have done it without BoV though.  Is BoV potentially part of the issue?  Maybe...  It doesn't change the fact that there is a serious fucking balance issue here and it's pissing me off. :(</div></div><hr />

As much as you guys complain Knights are too strong, I see classes too close to Knights.  I &quot;turn around&quot; and see how strong other classes are and wonder how this all happened.  Most Warriors fail to see how goofy all of melee is and only call for nerfs only because they are angry and not really interested in helping.  They want to hurt Knights failing to see every class that wields melee is not where it should be.<br />
<br />
Nerfing down Knights doesn't seem to be the answer at all.  A reevaluation of the entire freaking system makes more sense.  Some Warriors scream about nerfing Knights without realizing its just yet another symptom of the whole freaking mess.  None of you think its odd that a Warrior needs to do nothing special than just show up to tank Quarm!?<br />
<br />
I give up...some of you will not be happy unless another class is as miserable with you.  Its hate.  Pure hate that solves nothing.  Nerf Knights into oblivion so nothing tanks your percious monsters while the casters dance away with exp groups (which is where the xp and money is anyway).<br />
<br />
Warriors need fixed.  Its simple as that.  There should be something a Warrior can do that makes a difference.  If anyone thinks the Warrior class is &quot;only tanking&quot; then you should be mad as hell they continue to add content that actively defeats you.

Incase you don't read the sarcasm, I'll spell it out: Tanking is the ONLY thing a warrior does. It is what we were designed to do.

<br />
What does a Paladin do for Saryrn, Rallos Zek, Vallon Zek, or Tallon Zek if he's not tanking?  There's no collatoral damage to heal (RZ/VZ's AE are so weak it might as well be 0 damage).  Sure there are some adds but anyone can grab them and solo them.  A Paladin still does less damage than a Warrior.  So you can say a Paladin is only good for LoH the MT (who could be another Paladin) on these encounters.  They must be really underpowered and need a boost!  <br />
<br />
All the complain about how we're useless only serves to make sure a developer won't take us seriously.  I'm sure they know quite well that not everyone is supposed to be useful in a raid and saying stuff like that only makes them think everything is fine and it's just a bunch of warriors whining.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u158"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p158">All the complain about how we're useless only serves to make sure a developer won't take us seriously. I'm sure they know quite well that not everyone is supposed to be useful in a raid and saying stuff like that only makes them think everything is fine and it's just a bunch of warriors whining. Warriors are not useless on raids. Our roles are eclipsed by Knight right now but this isn't the first time something like this has happened in EQ.<br />
<br />
Not useless...But I want you to tell me this: What do I say to the next newbie that asks me why he should make a warrior over a paladin?<br />
<br />
I've played a warrior for five years. I've played almost every single day of that. I play hours every day....I haven't levelled a single twink over 40. I love the warrior class...And I honestly don't know what I would say to that guy except: Don't.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u161"><b>Nomilus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p161">To shed a little light on who, what, why and how we had Monks, Paladins and Shadowknights tank these mobs may help you all understand what we are upto. (some may flame regardless.. so be it)<br />
<br />
Who &amp; What:<br />
As mentioned on other boards we had Monks tank Fennin Ro. ( Vabtoo was the first and Rogan second )<br />
<br />
Yesterday I tanked Quarm, and today due to the patch we had Sharkon ( Ebil SK bastid ) tank Quarm.<br />
Also in todays PoTIme clearing I tanked RZ and Bert. <br />
<br />
Why:<br />
Two reasons!<br />
1) To see if could be done, and to do it as best we could.<br />
2) THE MAIN REASON was to show that the new Spell BoV has GREATLY trivialized most if not all encounters.<br />
<br />
How:<br />
We used our standard heal pattern for Tanamar (our semi retarded main tank) PLUS!!! constant BOV landing on myself and Sharkon.<br />
For my Quarm fight DI went off 4 times, but 2 were due to some clerics having tanamar as heal target (as they normally would and should) after much spamming in /GU it was rather smooth. The other 2 DIs went of during the heads coming off. Tanamar did /Shield me and paid with his ass on the last head. (we also used /shield on Sharkons attempt today)<br />
<br />
The RZ and Bert fights were Standard as per Tanamars normal heal pattern plus YOU GESSED IT!!  &gt;&gt; BOV &lt;&lt; cast on me.<br />
DI went off twice per fight I think.<br />
<br />
*** A little side note.. It was VERRRRY enjoyable to have a warrior /shield me and get pounded to dust.... after having used LOH and been smooshed or using AOV to save our Warriors asses sooo many times. ( I know im going to pay with that in many flames, but I just had to say it ) :p<br />
<br />
The main point of us doing all this is????<br />
Getting this game (that we ALL have played for four years plus) back on track.<br />
<br />
Throw that BOV out the window SOE!<br />
And beef up those gimp ass Warriors!<br />
<br />
I do not think that Sharkon nor myself could stand upto Quarm, RZ or Bert for the full fight without it. (we are both 8400 ish HPs unbuffed)<br />
<br />
Most classes do not have the above kind of HP to even dream of taking on the above fights, but with good of PoTime gear and heaps of BOV the gap can be greatly reduced.<br />
<br />
We stirred the pot and hopfully something good may come of it, if not we had a good time regardless.<br />
<br />
I would like to thank our NORMAL tanks ( yes Warriors) who stepped aside to let us prove this point. Thank you Tana Scimi Farill Cynd2 and Xio. Now get back to work SLACKS!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u164"><b>Torrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p164">A Paladin still does less damage than a Warrior. So you can say a Paladin is only good for LoH the MT (who could be another Paladin) on these encounters. <br />
<br />
Your guild must severely underutilize knights.<br />
<br />
Wizards are fucking shit vs the arch mage in fire.  That doesn't mean I don't want some in my guild.<br />
<br />
When Innoruuk spawns adds, and a 8k hp CH lands on the MT 1 second later, you expect warriors to reliably be able to aggro enough to prevent these mobs from raping a rot cleric or two?<br />
<br />
When you pull 4-5 mobs that quad 1k, do you not have knights aggro from a distance so the cleric who casts the first fast heal gets raped?<br />
<br />
Do your paladins not cover AoE damage for encounters like quarm?<br />
<br />
Do your knights not tank fearing mobs?<br />
<br />
LDoN is the new raid content.  Do you not use knights to prevent from adding to the death count?<br />
<br />
Once my guild had only 1 twink cleric available to heal for phase 1 rock.  How did we solve that problem?  3 paladins in the 2nd group.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u166"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p166">The encounters I picked are specifically the ones where Paladins can't do much.  I didn't say there aren't encounters where they can do a lot.  They exist, maybe too many.  The point is that no one is supposed to be the hero 100% of the time, which, in a raid with 72 people, implies that most people are useless most of the time as well.  <br />
<br />
Some people are saying like 'why would you want a Warrior'.  Even if no one else besides Warriors can possibly tank in this game, I still wouldn't want a warrior if there's already 5 of them in a raid.  I'd certainly want another Paladin for any encounters that has AE damage even if Paladins cannot tank at all.  <br />
<br />
On the other hand, even as overpowered as Paladin are, there are at least 4 Gods in Time (TZ/VZ/RZ/Saryrn) where if I can magically conjure up extra Warriors out of thin air, I'd rather have an extra Warrior (for slightly more DPS) than an extra Paladin, provided there was no shortage of Paladins.  <br />
<br />
Crying murder on anything related to Knights won't get us fixed, I'm pretty sure about that.  And if we're not going to get fixed, wasting time here complaining why Knight sucks isn't a productive use of time anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I mean, it's not about crying murder on knights.<br />
<br />
It's about being completely gimped.<br />
<br />
Knights are now interchangable with warriors.<br />
<br />
There's no advantage, or reason, to be a warrior.<br />
<br />
Remember those initial fears floating around about the vie line of spells and how it'd be giving defensive to knights?<br />
<br />
Well that's what Nomilus says is happening.<br />
<br />
/shrug<br />
<br />
Warriors didn't get fixed. They got completely broken and are now one patch away from being throw in the trash recepticle.<br />
<br />
The class has no function anymore. No identity.<br />
<br />
I can't even see this as over-reacting.<br />
<br />
Knights aren't tanking mythical &quot;old&quot; content. They're tanking the top end-game mobs.<br />
<br />
Why play a warrior ever again?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u168"><b>Goladus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p168">Knights are now interchangable with warriors.<br />
<br />
There's no advantage, or reason, to be a warrior.Do you mean to say that Knights are better than warriors?<br />
<br />
Because if Knights are &quot;interchangeable,&quot; then why is it a balance -problem-?<br />
<br />
Rogues, Wizards, Mages, Rangers..  all damage dealers..  all in most cases interchangeable once you have one of them.<br />
<br />
Nerfing Knights would appear to be the most elegant solution to the problem, true..  however it would likely only either postpone the problem or it would put Warriors so far ahead of Knights again that Knights would be in no way interchangeable.<br />
<br />
The problem seems to me to be that, as subtle as the EQ combat system is, it's really being pushed to its limit.  Warriors have been rather lucky in that their &quot;need&quot; on a raid is something fun.  Mages were incredibly powerful in Luclin because of T-rods, but damn if you think not having a spellbook sucks, try having a book full of spells that no one wants you to use because summoning a rod and dropping it on the ground is more useful than any of them.<br />
<br />
I mean I see Furor make comments about trading /disc defensive for spells and such...  I'm not sure how serious he is but from my POV it seems like the game would be a lot better without /disc defensive and instead smoother balance between Knights' and Warriors' tanking abilities.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u169"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p169">&quot;Do you mean to say that Knights are better than warriors?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nope. I mean to say that knights are interchangable, in regards to tanking.<br />
<br />
Warriors have been saying this for quite a long time now.<br />
<br />
Knights have been downplaying their accomplishments and trying to ignore warriors saying this.<br />
<br />
But now we got knights tanking phase 5 gods, quarm, and whatever else AO's gonna unleash their beasts on.<br />
<br />
They're interchangable tanks.<br />
<br />
What makes warriors useless is that warriors don't provide anything else. At all.<br />
<br />
So that ONE person who asks for Brell's Stalwart Shield or Hate Recourse SK ATK buff is suddenly tipping the scales of balance in favor of knight classes.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Because if Knights are &quot;interchangeable,&quot; then why is it a balance -problem-?&quot;<br />
<br />
Because knights do more than just tank.<br />
<br />
It's out of balance because the class of warrior no longer needs to exist.<br />
<br />
Knights now do everything a warrior does (the interchangable part) ... AND MORE (the spellbook part).<br />
<br />
It's the AND MORE that's the problem.<br />
<br />
Why do I have to explain this? How CAN'T this be obvious.<br />
<br />
Warriors used to be the be-all end-all for boss mob tanking.<br />
<br />
Now what?<br />
<br />
They're just 1 of many.<br />
<br />
There's no point to the class anymore.</div></div><hr />

Knights can tank most critters in the game now which isn't bad but Warriors should always make a REAL difference if they tanking the same Mob. (they do actually with DEF disc up and their higher defensive caps but it's not enough imho)<br />
<br />
I know there are Ideas how to improve the Warrior Class finally (more HP's, skills, discs, AA, ect) and I hope Knights tanking Endgame Boss mobs helps to make upgrades for the Warriors going live someday because of it.<br />

it's easy to say &quot;nerf Knights&quot; but it would not fix your own class!<br />

improve the Boss Encounters, improve the Warriors tank abilities is the Idea and not to change the scenario so it suits the Warriors again.<br />

Unfortunately, you are wrong. The very fact that you are accomplishing these feats is proof enough that the only logical course of action is to nerf your classes. There is nothing past Quarm. LDoN Raids once learned, are nothing more than playgrounds built for Knights to display their class superiority. Thus, to upgrade Warriors past what they can ALREADY accomplish will do nothing but trivialize the game even more. A game already so badly trivialized as evidenced by your guild's showboating the past week. Sadly, you cannot see that what you have done is not presented a case for Warrior upgrades, you' have presented a case for Knight nerfs - and a very strong case at that...<br />
<br />
The only upgrades they could give warriors at this point and not brutalize the delicate game balance which is already almost completely ruined would be along the lines of enhanced Pottery and Superior Sense Heading. <br />
<br />
I do, however, thank you for helping make my case for me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And what do you think Knights will be receiving come that expansion? Less power? Right, I didn't think so. <br />
<br />
I don't play a Warrior so I can pray that someday my class can become useful in comparison to other available classes. I don't play to hope that when I'm level 75 I will be as useful as a level 65 Paladin or Shadowknight. I play for the now and frankly, the now sucks.<br />
<br />
Sony can give me more Hit Points and more AC and it will still pale in comparison to the utility and abilities of a Knight. Knightemization destroyed the game for the only pure tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u174"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p174">I don't think this has to be a game where only warriors can tank anything high end.  The problem is that Warriors don't do enough besides tanking, or maybe the Knights do too much.  <br />
<br />
Take an encounter like Rallos Zek.  Here, the Knight is superior in aggro, but it is really not necesary because you're spending so much time fighting adds that I really don't see how you can not use up your full damage potential.  Although a Knight can tank Rallos Zek I don't see an obvious advantage to have a Knight tanking unless you just ignore the adds altogether.  However, since there are very few encounters where aggro do not matter at all, Knights consistently are better tank due to aggro dominating the difficulty of most encounters.  Hence this is where you have the problem.  For example would the fact a Paladin can tank Quarm be that bad if a Paladin's aggro is worse than a Warrior?  I strongly doubt it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So what can we expect from a new expansion sparky? Rumour is 5 or 10 more levels, guess what that means, more fucking hp/mana for you, more spells to further empower you over a warrior, with  those levels &amp; LDoN itemisation we can expect knights to tank everything in PoP despite the fact that our so called 'carrot' is to be a clear best at boss mob tanking (which is a crock of shit anyway given how few warriors as an overall percentage of the community get to main tank current content).  What percentage of the user base have even touched elementals, let alone Time yet? How long are you gonna consider it fair for warriors to be most advantageous in this nice new content - this time around it was only 3 months til the warriors role was trivialised - maybe that's too long and  you should cut it down in the interests of 'fairness' eh?<br />

/hugs but I have to disagree about BoV... :(  You could have done any of them without BoV, I know you got low a few times but from watching your health compared to watching Tana's in the past (non-def) there wasn't much if any difference.  I'm sure BoV didn't hurt but I think you most likely would have lived without it.  The spell really does have it's place in the game, particularly in the hell that is LDoN at times.  Though I wouldn't mind seeing it not be castable in oh say PoP but that's just b/c I don't want to see Time gimped for those that haven't finished it yet (yeah I know I'm an evil bitch but whatever).<br />
<br />
edit - psssst you know now they're gonna make you do it again without BoV this time right? :p<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Tanamar did /Shield me and paid with his ass on the last head. (we also used /shield on Sharkons attempt today)   Lesson learned, heal tana first, debuff mob after first round!  Actually he paid twice but that was my fault for not timing the ae and the rez. :(<br />

Who cares.  The game doesn't work that way.  You guild people for all encounters, not just a handfull.  ALL classes have a few encounters where they are worse off, including warriors.  My guild uses knights for RZ adds and Vallon splits anyway.  Dunno what your guild does.<br />

The dps difference between paladins and warriors is jack shit anyway.  The parses posted in the overlord forum slightly favor dual wield due to procs not scaling with haste, and don't factor in the paladin dps proc.</div></div><hr />

Back during the last major rebalancing, warriors were told we were the templates, the prototypes if you will, for the other melee classes. We were reminded we had Defensive (aka Warrior's Bane), patted on the head and told to go play. <br />
<br />
It was clear then and it's a stark reality now. We offer nothing beyond tanking, and we're clearly 'one among many' in that role now. A big part of the collective mistake was treating us as a template. The developers were afraid to raise us above that baseline for fear of destroying the balance with others. Then they went ahead and destroyed that balance anyways. <br />
<br />
It's time for SoE to define our role, not as templates, not as a baseline for every other melee class but as a fleshed-out, fully functioning class.</div></div><hr />

Thank you, I knew there was something I forgot... If Druids were to Clerics as Knights are to Warriors then you wouldn't need 2 druids to replace 1 cleric or 1 druid and 1 sham to make it interchangeable.  (edit - removed bit about how ch vs. dch works, it isn't relevant)<br />
<br />
Druids can heal and they can nuke BUT they can't even come close to healing as well as a cleric and our best crit nuke is barely on par with a non-crit wizard nuke. To me that's pretty balanced. They don't do either thing exceptionally well but they do both at an average level which offers a bit more flexibility in their utilization.<br />
<br />
They also pay for it with no way to protect themselves from aggro other than awareness of what is happening around them. Druids have no DA/DB, nor do they have concussion, if they land that heal at the wrong time they better pray for assist heals or a warrior that will /shield them b/c if they don't get it bye bye treehugger.<br />
<br />
On the other hand you have knights that tank as well as warriors before you even take their other goodies into account.  To me that's pretty unbalanced.  Warriors should tank better in AND out of defensive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u188"><b>Adarian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p188">You all scream that knights are overpowered cause a paladin can tank Quarm or (insert name of PoP mob here). Well i got news for you, paladins have ALWAYS been able to tank exactly what a warrior could just less efficiently. So why is it now a problem? It is a problem now because what stopped it from being done and being efficient in velious and luclin NO LONGER EXISTS and it doesn't have anyhthing to do with the paladins the SK's or even the warriors abilities. The limit on how long a c heal cycle can be run (mana wise) and how fast it can be run is what has made it all possible. That is what has brought this up. In every single expansion if guilds would have had 11+ clerics who can chain C heals and virtually loose no mana for it then paladins or any other class for that matter would have been able to tank anything successfully that a warrior can because simply when you get to the point you can have 1 c heal go off for every round of combat the mob does then unless that mob 1 rounds the target you will win. IE you got a 1 second cycle running on a enchanter vs. say tormax in velious era. you win even though the chanter has only 3.5k full buffed hp's as KT can not one round him thus the chanter can tank him and you can win. However in PoP and specially with Time guilds you often see 10+ clerics. How many clerics were in these cycles for the paladin of AO? I bet it was at least enoguh to make a 1-1.5 second cycle and to keep that up for as long as teh fight would last. At a high enough rate of healing all that matters is if the person will get one rounded or not.<br />
<br />
Lets go back to Velious time. I have made 2 magelos one is a paladin in close if not the best gear possible during that expansion. I have done the same for a warrior.<br />
<br />
Pal = http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=852133<br />
<br />
War= http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=852143<br />
<br />
The difference is about 500ish hp's which is around 10% and the ac is almost exaclty the same. The tuffest monster in the game at that time was AoW who quads for 1150ish so can deal 4600 in a single round. He can also flurry and does so itermitantly for an extra 2 attacks so 2300 more so a total of 6900 in a single round. The paladin with that gear (IE like the AO's paladin, about as well geared as the expansion allowed) has 4545 hp's unbuffed and can recieve 200 from DS 485 from protection of the glades  700 from marzin and can gain about 20 fom stamina buff finishing off his last 5 stam and 405 from focus. So buffs would be + 1805 bringing him to a total of 6350 total hp's and the warrior would be around 6900ish.<br />
<br />
What happens when you put that paladin in front of AoW with a 1 CHeal per meele round cycle? You win if the clerics do their job, that is unless you happen to have a horrendous stroke of luck and he flurry's, hits all 6 as hits, and hits for max on at least 5 of those hits and hits decently on the 6th which is simply a very long shot. This however was not plausable due to the number of clerics it would take vs the number of clerics those guilds had back then  and the amount of mana they would loose to keep that cycle going for what was at that time a 8+ minute fight. This was for a short time plausable with Mod rod 2 in its first form (if you can get like 12 clerics or so online)  but noone ever attempted it that I know of before the rods were nerfed.<br />
<br />
Fastforward to luclin. Hell if you run that same cycle that very same paladin without a single item upgrade could tank anything that exists in Luclin as nothing can one round him. emperor hits for quad 940 or so if i remember correctly aten a quad 1000ish some aten blobs trip 1600 but none of them could out do his buffed hp's in a single round thus if your mana is a non issue and<br />
you have the clerics he can tank anything. Hell if you get a 4001 hp enchanter he could tank emperor with that cycle because the most emp could ever do to him in a meele round would be less than 4k and his HT is 4k exactly leaving the ench at 1 hp while resetting emperors swing timer c heal lands and ench is all ready to take the next meele round and get c healed forever. However mana was a deffinate problem in long fights like emp etc so this was just not really plausable once mod rods were altered.<br />
<br />
Fastforward to PoP. Mana regen screams thru the roof while the cost of c heal stays exactly the same as it has been since the first time it was ever memmed on a live server and yet it is still the best heal in the game. Lets take a look at a Potime clerics mana regen.<br />
18 horse<br />
3 AA<br />
20 bard<br />
15 FT<br />
9 pot9<br />
9 BSt buff<br />
18 C5<br />
7 per tick average over time for a mod rod 360/50ticks<br />
Total of 99 per tick not including any sk group taps necro pumping etc etc.<br />
10 second C heal 2.25 repop you get a minimum of 2 ticks of regen back per c heal so 198 on a 340 mana spell (after specialization) means you only loose 142 mana per 2 ticks. a 6000 mana pool cleric can keep that rate up for 80 ticks or more. That is 8 minutes and that is longer than most fights take in PoP. Add in some necro pumpage and sk taps and you can turn out chain c heals damn near forever. <br />
<br />
Overall the difference between haveing a paladin tank and a warriors tank has always been about making due with the healing you can provide, which has almost always meant you use the warrior who has better defensive skills etc and disc defensive  because you can not afford the mana or have the manpower to use the paladin/SK. With PoP level mana regen and the numbers of clerics many of the Time guilds field nowdays it is less of a question of who would tank best as when you get healed after every round a mob throws at you the ONLY question is if you can and will be one rounded.<br />
<br />
Now as to all of those warriros who say to nerf knight tankability I got one thing to say to you, DOMINO EFFECT. They take away some paladin tankability away and suddenly rangers and bards and clerics are too close to paladin/SK so they in turn need to be dropped some then rogues and shaman and monks are too close to those rangers and bards and clerics so they also need to be dropped lower in tankability and so on and so on down the chain till you have in effect brought down the abilities of every single class. Basically what you are calling for would be a game wide nerf of every single class's ability to take damage other than warriors. That should not and most likely will not happen if SoE follows their normal game of follow the money.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u189"><b>Goladus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p189">Warriors have been saying this for quite a long time now.<br />
<br />
Knights have been downplaying their accomplishments and trying to ignore warriors saying this.And frankly, in many cases they have been right to do that, because except for a few issues(like probably maybe aggro holding ability), it's not at all a problem that Knights should be interchangeable tanks.  They ARE tanks, if they didn't want to tank they'd have played a fucking cleric or necro.<br />
<br />
Yeah warriors have, since velious or so, suffered from a severe lack of anything other than hitpoints and weapons.  I totally agree with you there.  But harping on Hybrid diversity isn't going to really make that point much stronger, and will mostly come across as selfish class whining which will get filed into the recycle bin by those who you want most to pay attention to you.  <br />
<br />
Whining about the paladins basically just makes you look jealous.  On the other hand, if warriors are really having problems as a class.. they aren't fun to play because you never get to do anything other than take hits and hit kick maybe, then I think you'll find your audience more receptive.  That's why this really shouldn't such a big deal.  It suggests that you guys are way too focused on what the paladin's are doing rather than what's really making the game not fun for you.</div></div><hr />

We used the EXACT same chain on the knights that we do on our warriors.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now as to all of those warriros who say to nerf knight tankability I got one thing to say to you, DOMINO EFFECT.<br />
<br />
<br />
Or you could look from another perspective...  Up the output of PoTime gods and along with it up the abilities of warriors, thus removing the need for knight nerf and their ability to tank something that is still the end game atm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u191"><b>Shadowfrost</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p191">Paladin tanks Quarm... does it matter?<br />
<br />
Well, obviously it does.  Right now, it matters a crap load to warriors.  But I think that's more about the state of the game as a whole, rather than about the fact of a paladin tanking Quarm - which was always going to happen at some point, just as (if the game lasts long enough) we'll eventually see rangers and rogues doing it.<br />
<br />
There was a time when the first paladin tanked Derakor the Vindicator.  Back then, it didn't matter - and the reason was the relative positions of the classes at the time; paladins got groups from their friends and from sympathetic people, rather than as the premier exp group tank.  They were a pretty irrelevant class.  Sensible people used warriors to tank bosses and monks to tank exp groups, or rather, those exp groups which weren't AEing in Sebilis.<br />
<br />
If the classes were balanced now as they were in mid-Velious, this wouldn't be a big deal.  You can imagine the guild's MT turning to their token paladin and saying, &quot;Well done, good boy, you tanked Quarm!  Now you've done that, you can put it in your ezboard sig, and you're allowed to change your surname to Quarmtanker.  Incidentally, Brells is blinking, so sort it out, thanks.&quot;<br />
<br />
But the present state of the game - where warriors have sunk from being the cornerstone of the Holy Trinity in Kunark/Velious to being somewhere between an irrelevance and a joke - makes this extremely sensitive, and I can understand why warriors are upset.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u192"><b>Bunnie Burner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p192">Whining about the paladins basically just makes you look jealous.<br />
<br />
Knights can basically do everything a warrior can do,<br />
+ they can solo very well,<br />
+ they get more and better weapons,<br />
+ they get more out of almost every armor out there,<br />
+ they are better in groups,<br />
+ they are better for trash mobs on raids,<br />
+ they have lots of utility (root, snare, pacify, FD etc...)<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm sorry, but if a warrior is not jealous of a Knight's ability...<br />
he's retarded.<br />
<br />
There is an immense inbalance, that is obvious... if you fail to see it, you need help... a lot of it.<br />
<br />
Now wether its Knights that need to be nerfed, or Warriors that need to be boosted... that depends of where SOE wants EQ to be atm.<br />
<br />
imo, Warriors need a huge boost, and Knights need a small nerf.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The only thing.. ONLY thing that kept warriors alive these past months, is their Defensive....<br />
and needing them for big bad mob fights....<br />
<br />
But now ask yourself one question...<br />
Why the fuck have 4 Warriors each picking up items, in your guild...<br />
when you could just double deck your Knights instead.<br />
<br />
You dont need Warriors for anything anymore.... <br />
Do your guild a favor, throw your current Main Tank aside... put a paladin in his spot.. and start decking him up nicely...<br />
Once he's as decked up as your MT, you'll know you made the right choice...<br />
<br />
But don't worry!!!!!!!! Warriors will still be present to /shield, those Main Tank paladins.<br />
Just find them a big AC shield, and give them the leftover hp items....<br />
force them to grab that Living Shield aa.... and you could double the efficiency of your Main Tanking!!<br />
<br />
And IF, and I say IF those paladins may die....<br />
you could always have a Warrior or Two burn up that defensive as last resort!!<br />
Although a Ranger WS cycle would be more effective....</div></div><hr />

  <br />
<br />
Which has absolutely nothing to do with the fact that the knights tanked equally as well as the warriors vs. the mob.  I don't care if they both had the uber 32k/tic hp/regen buff from ldon beta, they are both mitigating the damage the same is the point.  The knights shouldn't have been able to tank those mobs with the exact same healing we use on the warrior is the point.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Post the logs and I would wager that the mob did less DPS on the warrior than on the paladin thus the warrior is mitigating more than the paladin. Your clerics however make that extra mitigation pointless by healing 9000/1.5 second on a mob that might dish out 4000-5000/1.5<br />
<br />
Will say again the ability to have heal overkill will allow ANYONE who will not get one rounded very often to tank anything.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u200"><b>Adarian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p200">&quot;Same c heal cycle&quot; means nothing if it is already well above what the mob can put out which is kinda the point of any c heal cycle to heal more thant he mob is doing. If you have a 1.5 cycle going on a warrior with 11.5k hp's on a mob that swings every 1.8 seconds and deals on average 5k per round and a max of 12k then you in effect have a almost no loose situation. Change that very tank to a paladin with 10.5k hp's, yet make him have only HALF the mitigation of the warrior and with a solid &quot;same c heal cycle&quot; of 1.5 seconds per c heal you end up with the only way to loose is if in a single round the mob does 10500. The amount of mitigation becomes irrelevent besides one round deaths with that kind of healing.<br />
<br />
Let me put it another way. if a person has 10000 hitpoints but is unable to mitigate ANY damage and is fighting a mob that swings every 2ish seconds and quads for 2499 and a solid 15 second c heal cycle is going on him as long a those heals land at the rate of 1 per round of attacks the person will never die even though he can not possibly mitigate the damage the mob is doing.<br />

Noriluis: if so have the Paladin ('twas you yes?) tank Quarm w/o Vie.  I'm guessing you will do it again in spades.  I think based on what I've read here that Vie is *part* of the problem....but not the whole problem.  <br />
<br />
As far as warriors/paladins/Sks being interchangeable like dps classes are: that analogy is ridiculous.  If a warrior is not tanking we have no other real role either in an exp or raid setting.  We are a redundant appendage of 2nd tier DPS.  Duncil as they would say it the old Star Trek, something that has no apparant meaning or purpose.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u205"><b>Myst Darkwind</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p205">We are clear but the mitigation is apparently so small it is irrelevant and it does not justify the trade offs of being a warrior.<br />

No thats exactly the problem liz. <br />
Before this happened people were saying that pallys could not tank as well as a warrior. Guess what. they can. the 10%-12% more damage they take now is offset due to the increases in hp and mods. <br />
<br />
they proved a pally can tank those mobs. that means that pally (granted 1% of the populace, but thats all it took to nerf the cleric hammer when WBON cried out nerf) can tank anything a warrior can unless it can do 11k of damage in 1 round.<br />
<br />
The ONLY Solution? knights need a drastic reduction in hp to balance the game. I would say 10% reduction in hp from worn items would make it harder to pull that off safe.<br />
<br />
get him 9k and see if he can still do it.. if he still can.. reduce them more.<br />
<br />
That change alone would <br />
<br />
1. not affect knights in exp groups due to the aggro control and utility they bring.<br />
2. Still allow them to hold raid position as the best choice for offtank<br />
3. make warriors stand out as what they were designed to do. Tank the big shit.<br />
<br />
<br />
Don't give me better aggro, Dont give me a button that makes butterflies fly out my ass and heal the group. <br />
<br />

Want to put it another way?<br />
<br />
every mob in the game gets a 20% increase in dps<br />

warriors get innate increase of 20% in hp. <br />

<br />
IMO, SoE should boost Potime gods dps and dont increase/decrease any class' hp. For example, phase 4 gods have 30% chance to one round warrior w/o defensive or knight. Phase 5 gods have 50% chance to one round war w/o defensive and knight. Quarm has 80% chance to one round war w/o defensive or knight. So that war w/ defensive has major advantage to tank high-end encounters.<br />
<br />
It's really silly that any tank ( no matter you are war or knight ) can tank gods from start to end. We need tons of tanks to challenge gods. It can also solve the tank stackable problem in raids since multiple tanks are needed.</div></div><hr />

Casual monks are fine. No problems at all. Just ask anyone who trolls MB, and let's the monks know this on an almost daily basis.<br />
<br />
LOL<br />
<br />
Casual knights will be just fine if a nerf comes down. The gear is still amazing at the casual level, compared to what monsters casual gamers fight (AC 51 BPs, I mean come on! Let alone LDoN armors).<br />
<br />
&quot;but would still need a longer of a parse to weed out RNG innacuracy for diffiniative statistical information&quot;<br />

You pretty much underscore why you wouldn't need a longer parse with the second half of your statement here:<br />
<br />
&quot;but that is unlikely as noone is gonna take a raid up to RZ with the intent of tanking it with someone for 30+ minutes just to make a longer log&quot;<br />
<br />
I mean, this isn't one of those data collecting things here. This is data from a paladin tanking the mob in question.<br />
<br />
You don't need a longer parse. The mob is dead. Finit. End of story.<br />
<br />
A paladin can do it just as good as a warrior, according to the data.<br />
<br />
The rest is just moot. By taking the data out over a longer period of time, you may see something that isn't there.<br />
<br />
But it's pointless to apply it to this issue, since the fight in question, with the two classes in question, lasts that really short amount of time.<br />

<br />
Yes there is a slight shielding difference, I'm not convinced that 4 shielding would make that big of a difference.  It would bring them closer but even if it brought them dead even it still shows that knights tanking = non-defensive warrior.<br />
<br />
So I ask the question again, since nobody has answered it...  Can anyone honestly say that a knight should be able to tank as well as a non-defensive warrior given their additional utility?<br />
<br />
And no, there is no way we'd sit there and tank that for 30+ minutes for the science, the numbers paint a pretty clear picture even if they are not ideal situation.<br />
<br />
edit - Also, I would think the 10% avoidance that Tana has vs. Nomi's none would more than make up the 4 shielding difference.</div></div><hr />

I don't play much LDoN, so I'm in the same boat. Not much either of us can do about that. The expansion is set up so that you have to sink time into it to get the items you want.<br />

LOL. Sorry, you're talking to a monk with a warrior alt here. I don't have to IMAGINE what it's like to become less desirable for groups. I've experienced it. Not gonna garner much sympathy from me.<br />
<br />
:P<br />
<br />
I will say this though ... if paladins got nerfed, they'd still be insanely useful in LDoN, due to the amount of undead critters running around in some of those zones, as well as the fact that they'll always be useful off-tanks and decent CC and be able to peel mobs off of casters.<br />
<br />
The group utility won't go anywhere.<br />
<br />
Let ALONE the fact that it'd take a crapload of nerfage to get Paladins to the point where they couldn't TANK LDoN adventures.<br />
<br />
Even MONKS can tank LDoN adventures.<br />
<br />
You've nothing to worry about.<br />
<br />
Warriors on the other hand, have a lot to worry about.<br />
<br />
(Getting back to the topic of the thread).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u228"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p228">Lets see 8350 Unbuffed HP + 2550 from buffs = 10900K HP tank Aproximately, feel free to give me the correct numbers.<br />
<br />
Bulwark of Vie adds an effective  1090 to a 10900k HP Tank (as it can only mitigate a maximum of 10%) Given a CH Rot that hits between every Round..... (Yes I realize the max is around 1600, but for it to mitigate 1600, it would require the hit to be 16k, as 1600 is 10% of 1600, and the spell mitigates a 10% max  and given 10900 HP, a 16k Round would kill the tank regardless of BoV or not.) (Technically due to some fancy math thing it might be around 1200 or so but I not good enuff at math to realize it =p)<br />
<br />
This would make this 11ishk HP tank a 12ishk Tank effectivly. <br />
<br />
DI went off Twice during the encounter, (well 4 times but he said 2 of them were cause of cleric error)  Assuming this is from melee damage, not  a gap in chain, (would be interseting to see the logs of where DI went off) Which would Lead me to beleive the maximum spike, given his Shielding/AA/AC/I nnateCombateMitigationAndAvoidnace is somewhere between 10200 HP, and 12k HP, Out of an aproximaiate  16-17k max possible. (12k if the maximum spike he recived was received at 0.1%, or 10200, if the maximum spike was received at 14.99%, the range that DI would have triggered at, instead of being a simple one round, or not being enough to get into that range.<br />
<br />
So take away his Augments (Aprox 200 effective HP?) and the BoV spell. and He'd have around 10650ish Effective raidbuffed HP, which is 450 above at bare minimum the spike was, however in all likelihood one the spikes of damage were &gt; 10700 HP, which means, without those augments, and without BoV,  it is very very likely he whould have died; it is still possible, without BoV/LDoN augments to have taken those spikes, and lived, but is unlikely....<br />
<br />
So it is possible, is cause of BoV, and LDoN augments, which pushed him past the max spike damage for the fight, making it so he would be not one rounded. Given  10700  effective HP, what he'd have w/o augs/BoV, the fight would Most likely not have been sucessfull (not dying)<br />
<br />
This is why sometimes a relatively small number like 500 HP can make a world of difference in tanking ability, as it push's the said tank out of spike/kill damage terrotory.<br />
<br />
Ya I rounded a lot of numbers so it might have fudges the results a little either way<br />
<br />
And yes I do realize in a different fight, givne the same tank, the spike damage would not be the same, however 20 minutes or whatever he tanked Quarm for, is not a great sample size, but its a large enough of one to determine around what is near the maxiumum reliable spike. (Yes could theoretically spike for 16kish, but its just so unlikely that its statisitaclaly neglisble) <br />
<br />
What Adarion is saying is basically as long as a mob cant reliably one round you, with a CH hitting between everyround, anyone who wont be one rounded can tank it. CHC Speed is irrelevant as long as a CH hits between each round. (As quarm is very slowable, he attacks slow so you dont need an incredibully fast chain, you just need one that hits between each round) Going faster then one CH/Round does not do anything; you cant heal damage thats hasnt happened yet. <br />
<br />
Of course the reason the extra hp/effective HP pushed him past the 'spike factor' is because of 1) A so much time Loot, and B) The itemization of time items. (as many have said)... <br />
<br />
Preventing this (which given all his gear to make it possible, and additonal HP/Effective HP from LDoN) Would require <br />
<br />
A) Nerfing BoV Spell, as suggested, but even W/O BoV spell, with a few more loots and LDoN items, he could make up that effective HP and still preform the same, eventually given any class's HP, and mitigation, exceed's the max  real spike, they can tank any boss if they can hold aggro and a CH hits every round.<br />
<br />
B) Nerfing Knight Mitigation: This would in effect make it so would require more HP/Mitigation to counter the HP Lost.<br />
<br />
C) Increase the mob attack/DB/DI this would make it so he'd also need more HP/Mitigation to counteract the new maximum spike, but this would also make it harder for everyone else, and personally I dont think making a said zone requiring more gear, to prevent one of the best geared Knights in Game to tank something, making it harder for that one person, is particuarlly fair to the guilds coming into time<br />
<br />
D) C + Increasing Warrior HP/Mitigation the same degree. This would be an incredible feat of balancing, if they could pull this off i'd be really fucking impressed, but doing an across the board chance of all mobs (or raid mobs, or even just time mobs) and doing an across the board change to warrior HP/Mitigation could create imbalances someplace else, and there would also be  the question fo where to stop, if you increased the Mob dps of Time Gods, and the warrior HP, it would make everything before time a lot easier, and if they did it across the game, it would take so long, would be intersting to see tho...<br />
<br />
E) Giving more HP/Mitigation to warriors using time items, while icnreading mob DPS, dunno if this is possible.. but would be interesting, also of course would make it much harder for guilds breaking into time again, as doing stuff there would require the time items, as the mobs there would be balanced for the warrior HP verison of time items, not the present time items + elemental items.<br />
<br />
The thing is, ALL of these is merely preventing the inevitable, and that is getting a Knight (or any class) to a point where the chance for being one rounded is statiically neglible. Eventually it will happen, its just a question of when, and how<br />
<br />
Yes so Its the ultimate culmination of Bad time itemization, good Knight Mitigation, BoV, and HP augments reaching a point that is greater then &quot;the spike&quot; As its been pointed out before; this has ALWAYS been possible, its just by the time it was possible, there was bigger and better things to go onto, so it, or people never got to the point, because the exspanation was hard enuff to prevent that massive farming of endgame zones.<br />
<br />
Its been a year plus since pop has came out, PoP was defeated 4? Months ago, Give end game Guilds GOOD new places to progress too, and this would be just like when Knights could tank AoW, AHR EMP etc etc, not as big deal, It IS a big deal to people, because ATM hes the end game, the thing is HE SHOULDNT BE.<br />
<br />
I fully exspect rangers, hell even monks being able to Tank Quarm at the very very highest end of the game either now, or soon, just because when a guild stagnates at one place (Forced by lack of new content) other class's reach 'the point' given enough time.</div></div><hr />

We're not talking about gimp mobs though.<br />
<br />
We're talking about the top end mobs in the game.<br />
<br />
At one time, in the recent past, it was stated that monks could tank the top-end mobs in the game.<br />
<br />
There were mathematical models and simulations done to test this (since SOE couldn't trust just firing up EQ and playing the classes in the zones, they had to use models).<br />
<br />
This lead to a pretty big &quot;nerf&quot; of the monk class for stepping on the toes of warriors in taking situations of endgame mobs.<br />
<br />
Now ... knights are ...<br />
<br />
stepping on the toes of warriors in tanking situations of endgame mobs.<br />
<br />
ANY class, back then, could reliably not get one rounded by VT mobs.<br />
<br />
Didn't stop the monk nerf.<br />
<br />
And again ...<br />
<br />
would any of the paladins here care to answer the most simple of questions ...<br />
<br />

But good aggro is nothing if the aggroer is too inefficient to keep alive and maintain a reasonable group pace.<br />
<br />
I'd think monks and warriors (or monks with warrior alts) would be able to identify with this more than anyone else.  Would you wish your fall from grace on anyone else?

Wubao, if a monk Eventually tanks Quarm, should monks be nerfed? Differnence Between Vabtoo and that SK is what about 700 HP? Few more augments, few more Loots, maybe wont get to it exactly, but is it close enough? Quite Possiblily<br />
<br />
Every class in this game will eventually gain enough AC/HP to tank any boss, its always been this way, Knights will always be the 2nd class to reach this point. But hey, it will happen with everyone else eventually. When is it &quot;OK&quot; for it to happen?<br />
<br />
Or a ranger, what how close are they getting to that SK's HP/AC?<br />
<br />
Liz...<br />
<br />
I'd probably wager the reason why the damage taken is so close to eachother is because both are over whatever factors it takes to mitigate as much as possible (with the exception fo both getting more combat mods) Or people might have Kept BoV up more on the Knight, thats just a conjecture tho, so It might not be true<br />
<br />
Someone made a relative graph of how tanking works it went something like this<br />
<br />
.........__<br />
......../....<br />
......./.....<br />

Both people are on the 2nd section where its relativly flat.<br />

<br />
If paladins can tank better than warriors in XP groups, and just as good as warriors on raids ... why play a warrior? At all? Ever? <br />
<br />
I agree warriors need help, but people are acting like this is a common occurance. Warriors will reach the finish line first, it is EAISER To gear them up, becaus of innate class advantages, yes these class advantages are probably not enough, i AGREE with that.<br />
<br />
Are guilds going to be like hey a Paladin can tank Quarm, lets use paladins to get up to that point? Hell no, to kill Quarm most guilds went from Switching Defensive Warriors, to Keeping that warrior up most of fight,<br />
<br />
You said..<br />
<br />
&quot;It's very probable that somehow we'll have to pay for this, collectively, as a class.&quot;<br />
<br />
Doubtful.<br />
<br />
It'd be very easy to not &quot;pay&quot; for this.<br />
<br />
Just do the same feat with a different &quot;non-tanking&quot; class.<br />
<br />
Toss a beastlord, chanter, druid, rogue or bard in the mix and see if it can be done.<br />
<br />
Heck ... Vabtoo's guild already has the healing power to give it a go. Why don't they try out their best equipped rogue next? See what the deal is with them?<br />
<br />
Or their best equipped ranger?<br />
<br />
From everything Vabtoo and his people have said about the fight on their own web site and in here, it seems that they've really got Fennin down pat. So maybe next time they're bored with him, they'll toss a cleric at him to tank. Let the proccy hammer of doom have some fun. <br />
 <br />
<br />
Change Fennin to Quarm, and Monks/Rangers/ to Knights?<br />
<br />
Somehow its OK for a Monk to Tank Elemental gods? But its not Ok for a Tanking Class to Tank Quarm? <br />
<br />
Someone will probalby say I'm trying to divert the nerf bat or something to another class, thats not the point. My point is that given enough farming/Progression anything becomes tankable by anyone more or less, some class's just reach that &quot;Finish line&quot; First.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u236"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p236">Warrior tanking is not broken nor was it ever a problem.  The problem is that Warriors do nothing but tank.  A Warrior with more tanking doesn't have any baring on if other classes can tank this or that monster.  Importantly, a Warrior with more tanking doesn't make killing monsters that much eaiser.  This is one of the big, core problems with melee in general!<br />
<br />
I am stumped how more tanking will help Warriors.  I honestly don't see how any more of the same will help unless you want to venture into ridiculous amounts more.  Spell this out for me because I don't see how more tanking will make a difference.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u238"><b>Trilith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p238">Before I tell you all that you are right..itemization is all out of whack and a knight should never be prefered to tank endgame mobs (I don't see why it shouldn't be doable, I do however think it should be so inefficient that a warrior is undeniably the choice for it)... You need to just let go of the &quot;Hybrid&quot; model of looking at the melee classes who can cast.  It is no longer a viable means of debating.  The trend has been to move away from that..as much was stated back in velious.  <br />
<br />
You also have to understand that creating agro is only an indirect part of your job.  It is vital, but it is NOT what you are told you are best at.  In fact, you will never, ever be best at it, regardless of how a knight is nerfed, unless warriors are upgraded in such a way that no class can outagro them.  There is also no reason to believe that warriors should be the best at agro or that knight agro is contingent on how good warrior agro is.  <br />
<br />
Warriors still take damage the best, even if some of you keep implying that you don't.  Those of you who are intellegent know this, you just question what that really means.  And rightfully so.  <br />
<br />
Now, I'm going to tell you the same thing that rogues were told when caster balance came up-the class &quot;description&quot; means jack and shit.  It has never mattered for any class.  Casters faced that painful reality awhile, now its your turn.  Roles evolve, classes evolve.  To an extent, you are right when you say that your class hasn't.  The problem is, SoE seems to have finally realized something when it comes to balance:  No class can ever universally be the best at a given job, or classes that fill the same role are useless.  The trend away from the old idea of &quot;hybrids&quot; as gimp version of both their parents has gone, leaving some unfair remnants of that past (buffs for example).  There was a time melee dps was far greater in both theory and reality then caster dps.  This made casters irrelevant and unwanted.  What happened?  We now have fights that have high priority on range and burst dps.. and some that allow for more endurance type fights (though, the ammount of ft/spell ft a caster can get may be unfair at this time).  This gives a role to all types of classes and forces guilds to incorporate them all.  <br />
<br />
What does that trend mean for warriors?  Probably that you need to stop thinking of yourselves as the only people to tank raid mobs.  If this continues, (and itemization is fixed) there will be mobs that *need* warriors superiors mitigation and ones that *need* knights superior agro.  There is nothing innately wrong with that, it just hurts some warriors feelings.  In my mind, this approach is the fairest to all classes, it does mean though that itemization *must* be fixed so that paladins can never do fill both roles.  <br />
<br />
However, we run into a problem that no one has been able to solve.  How do you fix itemization of things like hit points when it is something that everyone needs because of ae's?  Get rid of the ae's?  Ok, but then you have to increase mob dps and the tanks hp, while lowering everyone elses.  Of course, you would lower knight hp in relation to warriors.  Warriors ability to take damage should always, always be significantly better then knights, knights better then chain melee, chain better then leather, leather better then cloth.  <br />
<br />
We are at an idealogical crossroads though.  Do we keep the format of warriors always being the best tanks and limiting the kinds of encounters we have, or do we accept that knights are also legitimate tanks that have different strengths and go from there?  I believe that every class should be useful, in both raids and xp groups.  That SoE should design a variety of encounters, each with different needs, so that which class is preferred is based on the circumstance, not some static mold. <br />
<br />
Don't take any of this as me downplaying what is going on now.  I am not.  These are very significant changes in approach and how they pan out will be interesting to see.  I don't think having a class that is universally the best is good for the game though-even if that means paladins shouldn't be it.  It wasn't good when that class was rogues or monks, so much so that most casters were ditching their dps casters to make them, and it shouldn't be warriors (or knights) now.  Dps classes should be roughly the same, each having strengths depending on the encounter, and so should tank classes.  <br />
<br />
Personally, I like my role as an offtanker.  I ,for some odd reason, would rather do that then be the MT.  I think its a good role for knights, but how do you fix itemization and not make it so warriors are the ones who take that job from the knights?  The only way to do that is to bank on their agro, but many of you want that stripped too.  What balance are you hoping for?  (I'm not saying or asking if you think there is balance now)  Is it simply that knights are only an unhappy, forced choice on those with no other options?  Or are you willing to allow them an important role?</div></div><hr />

From those logs i can tell there is a difference in shielding items by the difference in min hits and max hits. The paladin has more shielding than the warrior does by 4 if I am not mistaken. Take that away and the paladin would most likely not be mitigating more but I will have to admit that is closer than I would have expected but would still need  a longer of a parse to weed out RNG innacuracy for diffiniative statistical information but that is unlikely as noone is gonna take a raid up to RZ with the intent of tanking it with someone for 30+ minutes just to make a longer log :P<br />

Humm clearly outlined does it go like this:<br />
<br />
I.  Warrior Problems<br />
<br />
    A.  Fixes to classes<br />
         1.  screw them they are warriors<br />
         2.  see #1 if you are unclear<br />
         3.  are we still talking about this?<br />
    B.   Time for coffee<br />
          1.  send out some warriors i need coffee<br />
          2.  They are'nt back yet . . . lets nerf them somemore<br />
<br />
I find it very amusing after 6 months of cutting and pasting the future plans that they still have not outlined the problem.  Either the developers are stupid, or incompitent or both . . . . i'll let someone else deceide, though i think they are more apathetic to our problems anyhow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u241"><b>Goladus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p241">No, I don't have a fix, maybe something that will only affect high end gamersItemization mainly only affects it's target range of players.  Granted, even the lower tier raid guilds will tend to have a greater equipment disparity, since while they will be killing the same mobs and getting the same loot, they'll kill less often and have to outfit more people... so the loot will be spread more thinly than in your typical top guilds.    But I don't think making item adjustments will necessarily hurt that level of player unfairly either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u242"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p242">&quot;Would you wish your fall from grace on anyone else? &quot;<br />
<br />
Yes. But not out of pettiness, or vengance or anything so silly as that.<br />
<br />
I would wish this on other classes merely because, things are out of balance. It's not fun to get nerfed.<br />
<br />
Everyone says &quot;But monks deserved it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Well, what makes other classes, who are also making similar balance issues, but now with current content, so special?<br />
<br />
There's a problem with the game. Melees are marginalized.<br />
<br />
How does it get fixed?<br />
<br />
&quot;Wubao, if a monk Eventually tanks Quarm, should monks be nerfed? &quot;<br />
<br />
A monk tanked Fennin and ALREADY people were calling for nefs of monks ... AGAIN.<br />
<br />
&quot;Change Fennin to Quarm, and Monks/Rangers/ to Knights?&quot;<br />
<br />
Actually the problem is more than Quarm. As AO stated, as Nomilus stated ... when people took them to task for Quarm being slowable, they went and had their knights tank ALL of phase 5.<br />
<br />
All of it.<br />
<br />
It's not change Fennin to Quarm and Monks/Rangers to knights.<br />
<br />
It's change Fennin to EVERY MOB IN THE GAME and change monks/rangers to knights.<br />
<br />
If there's NO MOB a warrior is neede on ... there's no reason to HAVE a warrior EXIST.<br />
<br />
&quot;Somehow its OK for a Monk to Tank Elemental gods? But its not Ok for a Tanking Class to Tank Quarm? &quot;<br />
<br />
LOL.<br />
<br />
You are trying to divert the issue.<br />
<br />
It's gone beyond Quarm.<br />
<br />
It's now being shown knights can tank the whole ball of wax.<br />
<br />
When Vabtoo tanks Phase 5, and Quarm, even I will concede that the game is horribly broken beyond belief.<br />
<br />
But then again, isn't that what I'm already saying?</div></div><hr />

It's not an implication.<br />

It's parsed data being posted.<br />

Warriors have disc defensive.<br />
<br />
That's it.<br />
<br />
Damage received otherwise all seems to be rather similar.<br />

With Shielding Mods and Avoidance Mods and all that fun happy stuff having an infitessimal amount of difference, which would, according to the parses and the skeptics, take HOURS to show the difference in.<br />

Just WHAT DO YOU THINK A NON-HIGH END WARRIOR DOES? Do you understand how useless the class is? It's only at level 65 with hundreds of AA and the best gear in the game that a Warrior becomes even marginally more useful than a Bazaar gimp Level 65 Knight. How well do you think a Warrior that isn't any of the above fares? How about those warriors that don't even have /Disc Defensive? You didn't think about any of those people did you, you selfish prick? They have it worse off than any Paladin or Shadowknight could ever dream. Every piece of gear available to them out of the bazaar or some craptactular pickup group is also useable by Paladins and Shadowknights, whom *SURPRISE* make more use out of said gear at those levels as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u248"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p248">I'm fine with warriors getting more aggro.

<br />
Endgame Time Gear makes it so Knights can tank Quarm, and it makes its so warriors cant have as much aggro as Knights! Yay..<br />
<br />
If there's NO MOB a warrior is neede on ... there's no reason to HAVE a warrior EXIST.<br />
<br />
I'd like to see that Knight get that gear to tank Quarm, without a Warrior tanking Quarm/OtherTimeGods in the first place when learning encounter.<br />

Humm can i wield the bat??? That certainly would make it an attractive option . . . . .<br />

In all seriousness . . . it's not up to me or any other warrior to &quot;nerf&quot; classes to death or not . . . completly up to SoE . . . .<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u250"><b>Tirien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p250">Perhaps not so much as &quot;utility&quot; as we think of it, but a role.  I've always liked the idea of a slider bar for warriors.  Slide it one way, 30% more mitigation/30% less damage.  Slide it the other and get the opposite effect.  Then we can either tank or do damage.  If you have ever studied the fighting arts (martial, fencing, swordplay, etc...), there are different stances/techniques that emphasize either offensive or defensive qualities in each one.  I wouldn't see this as so far of a reach really.  But most of all above anything, warriors need snap/ranged aggro now.</div></div><hr />
