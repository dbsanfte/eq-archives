Though I would ask you opinions. Seems to me to be a pretty good weapon. I enjoy doing quests and am loking forward to completing s event. <br />

Any comments, or am I way off the mark here? http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=25244 (Serrated Flamberge of Hatred)</div></div><hr />

You gather four really rare pieces, hand them into a ship hand and a script runs.  As for the difficulty of the script I do not know.  I do know that I tried to gather those 4 items back when LoY first came out and I learned to really really despise that ship.<br />
<br />
This is what was posted on Alla's about the script:<br />

After you get all four items, you need to turn them into the Attendant. BE PREPARED. Once you turn in the four items you cannot enter OR leave the room. Captain Jrank or Captain Krasnok (depending on which reserve you turn in) will spawn in the middle of the room towards the back wall. Each corner of the room will spawn a 60th level Luggald (Fist of Jrank/Krasnok). You will need to have a tank on each fist, as well as your main tank on the Captain. The goal is to kill the Captain but NOT kill any fists, as if you kill any fists another will immediately spawn. The ROOM has several AE's on a timed schedule. It is suggested you bring a minimum of 18 well-equipped level 65's with balanced, typical raid groups.</div></div><hr />
