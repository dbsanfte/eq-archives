<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulk</div><div class="date">05-30-2003, 12:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, not wanting to open up a huge debate here.<br />
<br />
I have two weapon setups:<br />
<br />
for 2H i use Windblade.<br />
<br />
for 1H i use lammy/jagged blade of mourning.<br />
          or lammy/Bed Leg Club.<br />
<br />
<br />
yeah i know the 1hs stink but am finding out that in PoP i get out agroed by most all the other classes when i wield the Windblade.<br />
The 1Hs don't even come close to the agro of the windblade, i have tried it.<br />
<br />
I have limited funds.<br />
<br />
Should I save up for a Frostbringer, and then to a Frosty/lammy combo?  would it be more agro than Windblade?<br />
or maybe get a blood point?  to use with the lammy.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately I have to rely on what i can buy in the bazaar because my guild is not strong enough to kill most things.<br />
<br />
I still need a green dragon scale and a spiroc blade for epic so that is not an option yet, since green scales sell for 80 - 100k.<br />
<br />
Ideas?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lovax</div><div class="date">05-30-2003, 12:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've played with Frostbringer, Silken Whip of Ensnaring, Anklesmasher, Defender's Lightblade for 1 handers (so about where you'd be aiming for with your 1 handers), compaired to greatstaff of thunder any combination i can use of 1 handers get's it's butt kicked for DPS and agro (am level 65).<br />
<br />
Were I you, I would forget about 1 handers unless you can get SoD+primal or better, and just stick with the 2 handers... use windblade and save for greatstaff of thunder (I hear it is better, and grouped with a warrior using windblade I never lost agro to him unless he taunted off me, where as with staff I would agro off of him on accident sometimes).<br />
<br />
I'd keep windblade for DPS though when you aren't supposed to be tanking, as I have heard that it out proforms GSoT in that regard (though I have seen claims to the contrary, I don't have windblade so I can't test it personally).<br />
<br />
EDIT: I was able to get my GSoT in a trade for 2 valorium rings + a defender's lightblade, some people report spending even less (equivalent pp values), generally I believe GSoT sells for around 15 - 25k on most servers, when you find one up for sale.  That estimate is based on some of the threads about the weapon where people mention how they got it =).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulug</div><div class="date">05-30-2003, 12:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">lol lovax he has <br />
<br />
1) limited funds<br />
2) hes in a small guild<br />
<br />
so i really dont see a SoD/primal dropping into his lap anytime soon nor a GSoT.<br />
<br />
To be honest im getting tired of seeing everyone harp on about the GSoT. sure it may have great aggro but its a lot of money to buy and thats if you can find one for sale. on my server there arent ever any and when they do they go for 40k plus. anyway, it doesnt also mean that before the first GSoT dropped people werent able to hold aggro reasonably well with various combos of non EB proccing weapons.<br />
<br />
gulk id ditch the lammy and the bed leg club - which im not familiar with but assume it doesnt proc.  For the best bang for your money 1hs combo for under 10kpp, get a frosty and a silken whip.  I used to  use a bloodpoint frosty combo and that also worked reasonably well. <br />
<br />
other weapons you can consider are those new ykeshas, snowchipper or that barnacle covered axe which procs 100 hate.<br />
<br />
if like lovax says you find a GSoT and they go on your server for 15k then by all means pick up a GSoT, but if your server is like mine then go the 1hand proccing route.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikarii</div><div class="date">05-30-2003, 01:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well, for cheap aggro you can always ghetto swap into your weapons a praetor's blade of debility ( if you're a good race ) or even one of them black blades of tormenting which provide decent aggro and dirt cheap.<br />
<br />
on limited funds; i'd sell off the lammy/bed leg club deal ya got though and go for at least a frostbringer for the proc and a nicer PoP-level 1Her with some better DPS ( if you guys can go hit up UP for a mithril edged SS / LS of freedom for offhand DPS , mob really isn't too-too hard. )<br />
<br />
9/19's what you got are slowly phasing themselves out of your bags; and think they're hurtin ya more than helping.<br />
<br />
Keep the Windblade tho IMO. You'll grow into that weapon and will only get better as you level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulk</div><div class="date">05-30-2003, 02:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One thing i do need to add here as well, <br />
<br />
Still wearing an FBSS for haste :confused: <br />
<br />
I hate it, but sure can't afford an RBG much less the RBB.<br />
<br />
The Windblade does dish the damage, I won't be selling it anytime soon.  <br />
<br />
Thanks, will be checking bazaar for items.<br />
<br />
Will sell off Lammy and Bed Leg Club and Jagged Blade of Mourning.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lorre</div><div class="date">05-30-2003, 03:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lammy's and low delay weapons are nice and all, but against monks and rogues its not gonna cut it.<br />
<br />
Check out aggro weapons.  At the bazaar, you can do a &quot;primary&quot; search for warrior (plus ure race) and search for &quot;All effects&quot;.  That should bring up a list of weapons that have certain procs and such.  Start from the top (ie make it most expensive on top to least on bottom) and see which ones u can afford.  <br />
<br />
Frosty is a nice item, maybe wavecrasher if you can afford it.  I was using Frosty/Silken whip of ensnaring for a while and it held aggro way better than 2 lammy's.   For 2 handed weapons, sellable ones dont really cut it till you get the GSoT.  It procs like its possesed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">05-30-2003, 04:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't know that I'd hit the bazaar just yet.  I'm currently using a scimitar of ykesha (8/22, procs ykesha, no drop) and a venomous axe of the veilum brood (11/24, few points of AC I think, and procs venomous chill).  I've actually pulled aggro off MT a few times (He uses a windblade mostly) and had to bag one in favor of a lammy or bed leg club.  The best thing about these blades is that they were free(got them as drops).   Aggro off both is nice, DPS isnt terrible, and again, they were FREE.  Camp the arena in Kael for the axe, and the general and his cronies in Kithicor (rogue epic mobs) for the scimitar (can drop from any of them I think).  If you're funds are as tight as mine, the 6k or better for a frosty is gonna take some time, and these will work great 'till you can get one. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gulk</div><div class="date">05-30-2003, 05:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hmmm i have a scimitar of Ykesha in the bank, but didn't think that a dam 8 weapon would be that great.<br />
<br />
i would think the jagged blade of mourning or bed leg club would hold better agro.<br />
<br />
guess i should yank it out of the bank tonight and give it a try.<br />
<br />
Maybe try the Lammy/SoY combo and see.<br />
<br />
maybe make the SoY primary for procing.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tempur</div><div class="date">05-31-2003, 02:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">its not the damage from the yak that will get you aggro, it is the proc that has a 0sec stun component......and yaks like to proc.  i would try to get a frosty for mainhand and offhand the yak.  that should give you some solid aggro.  i'm also a big fan of the praetor's blade of debility.  i know someone that used frosty/debility and had very solid aggro.<br />
<br />
something you also might consider is grabbing a friend or two and heading to seb to farm cash and hope for a rbg or sbc to drop.  at 61, you won't get jack for exp but the cash would be good for future upgrades.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">proteg</div><div class="date">05-31-2003, 03:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sell the Windblade and get a Greatstaff of Thunder.  It will solve all of your problems.  <br />
<br />
Sell everything else too and upgrade to a RBG.  You won't need one handers with a GoT.  A regular old dps (for when not MTing) weap would be nice, but RBG more impt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sam3</div><div class="date">05-31-2003, 05:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Agree with Proteg, sell all your weapons (including the wingblade) and buy  the Greatstaff of Thunder and a RBG . It s a good dps weap (31 30) + an awesome aggro weap</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tormaz</div><div class="date">05-31-2003, 01:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am in a very similar situation as you are in. I have very limited funds and I have no guild because of the times I play make it very difficult for me to get into any that raid on a normal basis.<br />
<br />
Last night I was in PoV for the first time. (Level 60 Agnostic DE War) I was holding aggro just fine. I use a Frostbringer in my main hand and a Silken Whip of Ensaring in my offhand. I have absolutely no problems holding aggro off of other  level 60 +, with the exception of a few slows here and there.  I have a Mithril Edged Short Sword (10/18) that I switch out with the Silken Whip when the mob is at 70%, but thats just for a faster dps.<br />
<br />
The way I got the money was by getting a Virtue buff and then heading to Rathe Mountains and killed giants.. I did this at level 55 for about a week and made 6k, bought the Frosty for 5k and the whip for 500pp. <br />
<br />
I hope you found this to be a little bit helpful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lillyann</div><div class="date">05-31-2003, 10:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't know what it is that evryrone is talking about the Silke nWhip of Ensnaring. Sure the proc may get aggro, but honestly I have been using one for a few days now and all day today in PoN and it really isnt anything great.<br />
<br />
The whip procs much less often than the Forstbringer either in primary or secondary. And my DEX was buffed all the time over 160. The frosty is proccing sometimes 5 or more during a fight, and always at least once.. the whip totall sucks  compared to it.<br />
<br />
I am selling on on TT if u want * grins *<br />
<br />
Not only that but the DPS is really poor and the stats suck on it.<br />
<br />
Really disappointed with it so far, thank goodness I bought it for 650p.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lovax</div><div class="date">06-02-2003, 09:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">lol lovax he has <br />
<br />
1) limited funds<br />
2) hes in a small guild<br />
<br />
so i really dont see a SoD/primal dropping into his lap anytime soon nor a GSoT.<br />
<br />
Funny that, I'm in a small guild and generally have around 500pp to my name.  He's level 61, getting flagged for valor/storms isn't that hard (even for a small guild) so if he hunted there, got a few valorium rings, he could easily trade or sell those for cash for the GSoT.<br />
<br />
I don't have SoD, I don't have primal, and GSoT seems to be the biggest tradeable agro for a cheap-ish price (when you see one for sale).<br />
<br />
Anyway, it wasn't an unreasonable suggestion if he can get valor / storms flagged at level 61, which shouldn't be that hard of a task.. if you saw the list of 1 handers that I use then you should see that I am by no means rich beyond anyone's wildest dreams =P  or in a huge guild.<br />
<br />
EDIT: as far as snare whip, it's a good weapon for the 600-1k that it will set you back, especially if you don't have anything better for offhand.<br />
<br />
Anklesmasher though is the weapon that is this whip, but good... I haven't seen one for sale though, I looted mine on a guild raid.  Anklesmasher will regularly proc 5 - 8 times a fight (shaman buffed), but that was only for testing or when I am supposed to be on snare duty, otherwise I use my trusty horn-stick (GSoT)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raunstonecutter</div><div class="date">06-02-2003, 11:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Speaking of the old anklesmasher, someone was trying to sell one in the bazaar for 125k, I just laughed.<br />
<br />
As far as cheap agro:  preditor's blade and black blade of tormenting are two cheapies that should go a long way.  Then again, I used to tank in HoT with a Jade Mace/Frostbringer Combo.  I also used to do ok in PoV groups with the windblade. just have casters root it when you engage it in camp, and you should be ok.<br />
<br />
Good luck to ya =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lovax</div><div class="date">06-02-2003, 03:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">125k for Anklesmasher?  lmao... it's handy, but not *that* handy hehe =P.  I wonder what they were thinking to ask that much?  insane.</div></div><hr />
