I assume it must be the reward from this quest:<br />

Basically I am curious, I guess this means someone have beat the northern path in Tacvi? Anyone know what guild? I dont see how else anyone could legitimately have obtained those writings since the doors are all sealed.</div></div><hr />

Kinda weak honestly for the level in which the writings are dropped :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rueeliar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Making something &gt;250 hp doesn't make it fabulous.  All in all, this thing is very, very lackluster.  Same AC as the Effigy, but no Shielding.  15 less AC than Lodestar.  Attack is essentially wasted for tanks.  DS is a cute gimmick, but inevitably does zero for tanking.  The only thing on it which makes it even remotely useful is the Dodge mod, and it's very questionable if that would ever really stack up against 2 Shielding.<br />

I'm hoping there are different versions of this item for the quest.</div></div><hr />

Not questionable at all. The dodge mod doesn't stack up against 2 shielding.</div></div><hr />
