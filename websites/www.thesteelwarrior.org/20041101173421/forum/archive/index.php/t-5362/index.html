<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fenring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sword of the Blodsworn</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jumbojak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Agreed, sword of bloodsworn and copper hammer of striking works as a good combo for me at lvl 50.  Will help you until you can get some of the planar stuff or BoC level equipment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zhium</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The only poablem I have is money lol =) in Eq</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">What level are you?  It's not a hard exp group camp to get that sword.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zhium</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm 59 working my way to 60</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Superchum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">At that level you should bug your friends to try and go camp some of the stuff in Droga. The zone has quite a few good drops. You can get Copper Hammer of Striking AND/OR Sword of the Bloodsworn for yourself. And you can get many other drops in the zone that your friends would be interested in. And there's plats to be made.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gharghael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">AND you'll get experience. Droga is teh win. Get a good map, a few friends and go for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zhium</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thanks for all your help. but if anyone eals have any suggestions please feel free t opost thank you for all your help =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>robertburch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Might want to think about the Greatstaff of Thunder. I know you said one hand, but i dual weild both the hammer and the bloodsworn sword, and almost ALWAYS prefer the GSoT. It also has the benifit of costing less than 500pp as well. Just thought i might throw that out there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>paladiin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">CHoS/SoBS really is the best 1H option in my opinion, unless you plan on killing some higher end raid targets.  Run, don't walk, to Droga with a few buddies and you'll wonder how you survived with your Frosty/Snowchipper for so long.<br />
<br />
That said, the 2H GSoT is just as good from what I've seen, can be had for very cheap (still under 100pp on FV), and would be a huge increase in agro over your Frosty/Snowchipper.  Give it a whirl and see what you think.<br />
<br />
Are there other 1H options out there? Sure, but none that will be easier for you to get and offer strong agro for the effort.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>gwarf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Sword of the Bloodsworn is down to about 5900 plat on Povar</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Mistikat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">GSoT's are so cheap, buy all you can and stuff them on mules to replenish your Tribute Points ( These baby's get ya 27kp Tribute).<br />
