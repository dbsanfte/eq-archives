<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fabianz</div><div class="date">04-30-2003, 05:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I read and believe that off-hand weapon delay is independent to main-hand weap delay, but is it completely independent or just partially?  Awhile back I read somewhere that the delay of you off-hand weapon is not the only thing that will determine when you will get a duelwield check but that the delay of your main weapon have something to do with it also.  The way I read it works like this:<br />
<br />
If main and off-hand weap delay are the same then DW is checked every time main weapon attack.<br />
<br />
        Example:  18 delay weap and 18 delay weap<br />
                         1 DW check per main weap swing<br />
<br />
If off-hand weap delay is greater than main weap delay but less than or equal to two time main weap delay then DW is checked every other time main weap attack. <br />
<br />
         Example:  18 delay weap and (19-36) delay weap<br />
                          1 DW check every 2 main weap swing<br />
<br />
My question is was this how it works or did someone tested and disproved?</div></div><hr />

<br />
So it is dependent to main weap delay?  2 replies and I already have 2 different answers...hehe</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iskandar</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 12:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">grah think we have a thread on this on the board, ahh well =)<br />
<br />
in the offhand you basically want a good ratio<br />
<br />
every time the delay of your offhand is met (20 delay = 2 seconds unhasted, for instance), you roll a check against your dual wield skill. if the roll is successful, you'll swing once with your offhand. you'll also roll a check against your double attack skill, if successful you'll swing twice with your offhand.<br />
<br />
there's no damage bonus with the offhand so speed isn't as important.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 02:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Off hand is 100% independent of primary. You can equip a torch in your mainhand and your offhand will still swing every time the weapon delay is met and you get a successful DW check.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mokor</div><div class="date">05-02-2003, 08:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">got curious so i did some test.<br />
<br />
off hand will only swing if dw checks, faster delay means more checks. <br />
<br />
repost only works from main hand, with repost you attack no matter what torch,lightstone, cermonial warsword, for punch damage magic held will allow you to punch magic on repost.<br />
<br />
da skill feeds tripple attack you can tripple off hand (i swear it was a optical illusion i'll have to hack my log apart to dubble check)<br />
<br />
dw check from main hand resets offhand delay<br />
<br />
now someone need to come up with the math to figure out when its bast to go for speed and when its best o go for dammage and best for ratio.<br />
<br />
if any want i can provide the punching a wisp with greater lightsone fight log.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grendonbb</div><div class="date">05-02-2003, 08:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You are mistaken Mokor, the primary hand hasn't the slightest effect on your offhand.  <br />
<br />
If a fast primary hand let your offhand cycle more, then everyone would be wielding Nev's dagger (10/15) or Braided Strands of Corrupted Mana (12/16), and be tossing a really slow, really high damage weapon in the offhand.  And as you can see, this is not the case.  <br />
<br />
I have also parsed it out, and it is a quite easy parse since you can tell if you just equip a fire beetle eye (or whatever) primary, and just pop a weapon in your offhand, parse out the number of attacks, then put your primary weapon back in, and parse out the number of offhand attacks.  <br />
<br />
If you get any more attacks with primary weapon equipped, it is purely luck due to the randomness of offhand swinging.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hussar</div><div class="date">05-02-2003, 09:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Your primary delay does NOT do anything to offhand.  I actually decided to try this to be sure.  First, I equiped a fire beetle eye in primary, and a priceless mace in secondary, I also took off haste.  Mace swung normally.  Next I equiped a snare whip (28 delay) in main, and priceless mace in off again (20 delay).  My offhand was going off noticably more than my primary.  So once again, primary delay does NOT do anything to offhand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dobbo Baggins</div><div class="date">05-02-2003, 09:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">test on old board with lammy and sionache's partisan.<br />
the partisan in primary lammy in off<br />
<br />
the lammy did swing when the partisan didn't and yes once or twice(only like 10 sec test) the partisan dual wielded second.<br />
<br />
so offhand delay does matter<br />
yes, if secondary attacks primary can have a attempt at dual wielding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mokor</div><div class="date">05-04-2003, 11:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i figured out  what was causeing my problem. took me a while to see it. every so often i would get 4 swing on the same timesamp. the rest would be 1 second off. /smak forehead duh 20 and 30 are the same delay evey 60</div></div><hr />
