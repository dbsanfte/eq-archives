<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylas</div><div class="date">07-16-2003, 04:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My first post, please be gentle :)<br />
<br />
I have a question about /assisting mez'd creatures to see who the mob has targetted, so you know when to break mez so the chanter/cleric/shmmy doesn't get eaten.<br />
<br />
Maybe it's just me, but the name in the Target window never ever changes.  From my experience (and I admit I do not have nearly the experience that you folks have) but a mob has whoever it hit last / whoever is at the top of its hate list in his &quot;target&quot; box and the moment it becomes mezzed the name doesnt change until it is given an opportunity to attack something else.  I've been testing this ever since I started my warrior and have been grouping with enchanters (around lvl 20), and when I assist the mez'd mob the name never actually changes, no matter how many times I hit taunt or the enc/shm slows or cleric heals (things that would generate aggro and move someone to to the top of hate list, and therefore, to the mobs target box).<br />
<br />
Does anyone who /assists mezzed creatures before breaking /assist the mob before they hit the taunt key? just to see who already is the mobs target?  It's not really something that is parsable or anything, just something i've observed.   Would anyone be willing to test this and post your findings?<br />
<br />
For example, At mv level I am usually pulling (only 48th atm) and I have been the primary puller/tank in my groups during my grouping career.  If I pull 2 creatures both are attacking me, one gets mezzed while the other dies.  When i /assist the mob (before using taunt), I am in the target box (only one who generated aggro *before* mez is myself since I pulled), but if I just attack we all know the creature is going after the enchanter, since Mez aggro is &gt; initial pull aggro.  I've had the enchanter cast tash and slow on the mez'd creature (to generate more aggro), and I am still the target when i /Assist, again without ever having taunted.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, If multiple creatures come in and someone else pulled, or the shaman hits the wrong one with slow, or a cleric had to cast an early heal, or the enc AE stunned, or for whatever reason someone besides me is on the aggro list, and I assist (again before taunting) I'll get that person's name.  No matter how many times I use taunt the name will not change, but when i do break mez the mob is generally attacking me.<br />
<br />
Just curious if anyone else has noticed/tested this, or If i'm just smoking something?</div></div><hr />

If I were you I wouldnt waste your time doing anything other then taunting mob once in xp groups before breaking mez.</div></div><hr />

I suspect that what you're seeing has more to do with the mechanics and limitations of taunt as outlined in this excellent thread (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=1811) than with behavior particular to mezzed mobs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's a useful tool - assisting a mezzed mob - but not a foolproof one.</div></div><hr />
