I see no point in paying 30 bucks to barely play for another 3 months. PoP is old. GoD is ridiculously stupid. If all there is to look forward to is Omens of War, /bye.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fenring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I still play. I see them working to resolve bugs. I see more communication from the devs about what we as players want from the game via the SOE boards. I saw a quick response to the OoW boycott in the form of pushing back the release date and the meeting this weekend. All are good signs to me that they recognize they have competition from WoW, CoH and others and that they need to do better. Maybe I'm wrong but I'm going to stick around and see how it goes.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'm as much curious about how many people quit and still post as the number of people that still play. This is a pretty solid community, and I don't plan on leaving for quite a while. If they improve the game enough, I'll play again. If they don't, I won't. I'm not angry with SOE, I just got bored of EQ. I just want to log in and have fun if I log in ever again. Because I'm not currently guaranteed fun, I'm just not interested in logging in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Boy this poll has to terrify SOE execs... more than 50% of the poll has quit or playing much less.</div></div><hr />

  The playing much less doesn't terrify them at all. You're not paying per minute, you're paying per month. If you never logged in again but kept paying, they would be dancing (from a business standpoint, not trying to make a commentary on their personal ideas). One less person to stress the server and demand content while still sending in the same payment as the 8+ hour per day raider. Casual players are their bread and butter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Iskandar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I think and certainly hope Kailyn was being sarcasmic =D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Yes but people who post on boards are probably amoung the most active players...and I think we commit or not. We wont really do just a little EQ. Besdies at this point the incremental costs of an acount have to trivial. The servers have to be on no matter what, and I would suspect that their internet is on some sort of flat fee considering they have to be on of the single biggest consumers of bandwidth.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're still not hurting them by keeping your accounts active and just refusing to play.  This is why nothing has changed up until now.  People would just get bored and not log in.  Subscription numbers were still high, there was no problem as far as they're concerned.  Once people finally started getting fed up enough to outright cancel them, now we see action from people who want our money.<br />
<br />
I've always advocated canceling your accounts...even if you just decide to take a break.  You'll save a few bucks, and your canceled account will send a message.  It may not be yours personally that makes the difference, but if everyone starts taking this approach, they'll notice when they've fucked up.</div></div><hr />

I disagree. Not playing the game and getting caught up in the social aspects and character progress makes it really hard to a player to want to play. In some respects, atleast for me, the less I play, the less I want to play. Eventually, I'll lose all interest in the game and quit if I find all my friends have gone or my major gripes go unresolved.<br />
<br />
The only reason I still have my account open is that I've tried other online games and they just don't quite cut it. On the other hand, I can hardly stand to play a single player game anymore. I really enjoy playing games with friends, so I guess I'm kinda stuck atm.<br />
<br />
I don't think EQ is any worse off than any other time in the games history since I've been playing, even then despite the annoying problems that have been resolved (camping, soloing, etc) in other games, EQ is still ahead on playability.</div></div><hr />

  I consider my 2? ( 3? 4? Lord only knows...) month absense quitting. If I logged in and had more fun than I would have had doing anything else at that moment and was pretty sure it'd keep being fun, I'd come back. I'm not trying to make a stand other than that I'm NOT having fun anymore. That fix that, and I'm back.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">South Ro camp. <br />
<br />
And I was quit at the time. But the damned how do we save everquest thread sucked me back in. Looking at the guild tool, the last time the character I had been playing was in was 3/24/04. So been away 2+ months.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Thalzaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I just recently retired myself, although it's been a while coming. After getting burned out having to push guildmates through vxed/tipt trials, it really burned me out. Combined that with 4 years of playing the same game and I just felt it was time to move on.<br />
<br />
Like Fitemore said, i'm not mad at SOE or have some spiteful deathwish for SOE employees, hehe, but i just grew bored of the game and needed to move on. I really enjoyed my time in EQ and met some great peeps. Currently i'm playing Lineage 2 and while it's not the greatest game, it's keeping my attention for now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Kiya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Did not quit, but my play time has seen a quite noticable decrease.  Dx9 pretty much made it near impossible to play both my chars, so I cancelled my cleric accout until it is fixed.  Having to wait over an hour to find a healer for a group gets on my nerves, where I would normally just bring my own healer.  This frustrates me and makes me log in less often.  I'm am very much hoping that things are fixed, and soon.  I still want to play, but for fun, not to be frustrated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Vigdis SangCaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I have only logged in specifically for raids since about November of last year.  Since COH came out I sporadically missed raids.  Over the last three weeks or so I haven't logged into EQ and I cancelled my subscription a week ago...which still gives me until September should I for some reason feel like playing again.<br />
<br />
It's a slow process, giving up something that took up a large part of my life for almost five years.  But I had quit &quot;playing&quot; EQ a long time ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Sloanbone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I just retired my warrior. Unless I am raiding (and I am not anymore), I just find being lv65 boring. As a casual player, I have been lv65 for over a year and have 35AA. XP is just way too slow in this game, takes too long to get a group, and as you know.... warriors can't solo.<br />
<br />
I sold all my droppable equip and super twinked a shammy. WOW! I can now solo and kill stuff and move right on to the next mob!. To me, twinking is the only way to have fun in EQ and you actually feel a sense of accomplishment when you log off.<br />
<br />
Any way, my account is paid until July and then its done for good. <br />
<br />
I hope WOW is more fun for the casual player.<br />

Not sure I'll be playing WoW, although if I do I'll be a warrior again ;p I just think mmorpg's are running stale.  They all have their own flare, but in the end you just kill things the whole game, and as you go they get bigger and have new names.  Maybe I'm too cynical from how SoE treated my guild with those crappy LDoN raids and buggy Ikkinz, but I just think all these upcoming super games will still leave me with that &quot;okay now what?&quot; feeling.</div></div><hr />

I log in a fair bit less than I used to.  Raiding is still lots of fun, but outside of raids there's very little I can do that will upgrade my war except for Ikkinz trials.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Crystara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I quit fully roughly a month ago, games boring after doing around 650 aa and all your non raiding stuff you can do done and also playing a twink wizard to 65 and 120 aa.  I might play again, but I doubt it.  Sort of sad seeing as I have aquired so many neat things that alot of people don't have that will now go to waste, wish they would have made the game interesting again.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I'm continuing to play, but four things have me deeply disapointed:<br />
<br />
1. Probably two dozen full guild raids that ended early without success because of bugs since GoD release and the DX9 change. The biggest reasons include mobs out of game space and  players sent of of game space. In addition to ending raids, this has often made successful raids much more of an ordeal than easily tolerated and has likely cost guilds half of the progress they would have otherwise made.<br />
<br />
2. Absolutely awful itemization including +End augs, Curled-Toe Elf Shoe Sword/chan BP #6-16.<br />
<br />
3. Failure to adjust GoD content to the proper difficulty level promptly. I did some Ikkinz trials with 2 Clerics, 2 Warriors, 1 Enchanter, 1 Rogue all PoTime equipped and lost easily as often as we won. I log on to have fun - not pull nails with my eyelids. Rediculously hard != fun. Maybe it does for 3% of each server's population, but for the rest of us a 3-4 hour trial or raid that we ought to be able to secceed at and fail = fuq this, tomorrow I'm not logging in.<br />
<br />
4. Tank Parity (and Spellbook Superiorty). The ever changing set of reasons/expected outcomes used by a dozen Knight posters to sow disatisfaction among their fellow mid-level sub-10K buffed brethern trying to convince SoE that they should have Defensive, Defensive by another means, etc. When the ENTIRE reason I chose to play a Warrior and retired a Paladin only has meaning vs. a half-dozen current content mobs, only on raid day, and only if I'm one of the Warriors lucky enough to be put on the MT list then it is time to quit.<br />
<br />
And on top of the unfairness of giving Knights a substantial part of the Warrior class defining ability is the fact that it's wrong-headed. Accentuating the differences between classes, make Knight raid contributions different than what happens if instead you simply substituted a Warrior. That's the way the game ought to be. Not three flavors of the same class, one with an unimaginably inferior spellbook.<br />
<br />
As a result of all of the errors SoE has made, the pressure by Knights to be Warriors with Spellbooks and the prospect the SoE will as usual give Paladins godmode, half of the Warriors I know are now logging on only on raid day and most not even then.<br />
---------<br />
In all of this time, the only thing SoE has done that put a smile on my face was the Fabled mobs. So naturally they were removed.<br />

So true, the only reason I haven't moved fomr EQ yet is the lack of decent options from other games i've played. I never understodd why pure melee was always kept at such a disadvantage in EQ while hybrid class were given nearly all pure melee skills and retained their spells instead of a proportionate disadvantage in melee to their advatage from spells. Verant set out in beta to make it clear that hybrids would not be superior to pure classes, but that's not what happened, I see it everyday I log in and group with a knight. There's nowhere near a significant difference in tanking ability between knights and warriors.<br />
<br />
Then theirs the sore lack of damage output by melee compared to casters top that off with the melee's need to be armed to the gills and casters simply having to go an NPC vendor, buy a spell, and scribe it for instant upgrade. Thier is a fundamental flaw there that I dont think the game will ever recover from, the difference is too great.<br />
<br />
I'l be sooo glad when I find something else, but for now EQ is still the best out there for me even despite it's flaws...makes you kinda wonder what the hell the other game companies doing, sitting on thier thumbs?...</div></div><hr />

I don't see how warriors are kept at such a disadvantage in EQ, nor that a caster can simply go to an NPC and upgrade, can't we go to tome vendors and get an instant 45% mitigation &quot;spell&quot;? And contrary to your thinking, a poorly geared caster is just as useful as a poorly geared tank.  And melee DPS is comprable to any caster DPS, given equal gear, otherwise you'd see tank healer slower puller wiz/mage/necro x2 and the rogues/rangers warming the benches</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Vicaire Delestacia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">The buggines of EQ right now is what is going to make me and my personal group of friends quit EQ.  We went to PoN last week to experiance on yard trash near the zone. All the trash mobs that wander there though are stuck in the river making exping there impossible unless we only killed the few static spawns.  Yes, we could have pulled the mobs out of the river but zoning every pull because we have to split the twenty mobs that are stuck in one spot and taking the occasional death was just not worth it.  <br />
<br />
This week, we go to Skyfire to work on a cleric epic and get some sunlights for armor. The same bug is in effect in this zone too.  Almost all the mobs in the zone are stuck in the lava flows.  The only mobs that aren't are the statics near VP and some wanderers near the BW zone that don't path through lava. <br />
<br />
We are tired of dealing with the bugs of EQ.  DX9 and the complete lack of effort on SoE's part to fix it has ruined this game for us.<br />

Are you playing the same game as me? Thats group make up is exactly the common group makeup I see from day to day. Gearwise, so your telling me a naked warrior is just as useful and effective as a naked caster.<br />
