<br />
Because if levels 66-70 are anything like the rest of EQ, they will be more valuable than any AAs, but just as soon as we are done with that we get to do the wonderful grinding of defensive AAs that we have already done twice. So--just start banking some now.<br />
<br />
There are likely 3 reasons to pregrind <br />
<br />
1) Extra defensive stats will no doubt help get levels 66-70.<br />
<br />
2) What you grind now you won't have to grind later.<br />
<br />
3) Its possible that the defensive AAs will be more powerful than what you are saving up for now.<br />
<br />
And on the good side...if I am wrong and you would have been better off spend the points as you got them... the only thing you loose is the time you would have had the AAs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unless of course you don't yet have the Luclin/PoP defensive aa's. Generally you've gotten more bang for your buck going in order of expansions. That said though, I completely agree, intend to have my 30aa stored before I blow anymore new purchases. ;)</div></div><hr />

I think that would be covered in the if you have all your defensive AAs bit ;).<br />
<br />
Haass<br />
<br />
Well I don't hear tanks at my level of gear/AAs talking about banking up. The raiders are...but I have not heard anyone from the non-raiding crowd talking about banking some up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">08-26-2004, 10:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe because most people take a few MONTHS to get 30aa's, and it's not measured in weekends like people who have the 8aa/day XP spots.<br />
<br />
It might also be because if there's jack and shit to do in GoD as a 5khp/100aa tank, what the holy hell are you gonna do in OoW?  Get to level 70 so all the content you can do is green?  Maybe people learned a thing or 2 from PoP.  I sure hope they did, because I really don't wanna read the whining about how there's nothing to do for the 5500hp level 70 warrior because BoT is green.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">08-26-2004, 10:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been doing some of GoD and you know what, as a 5.3k HP, 112 AA, 1393 AC tank...there are parts of GoD that are doable and very good XP. With a good group I can get an AA in an evening in LDoN--certainly 2-3 a week. GoD is at least 1 AA/2 hours. <br />
<br />
Notice I did not say anything about 30 AAs--I don't think I will have that when OoW goes live--anywhere near there. But that does not change the logic of even scrapping together a meager 4-5 AAs and starting on the next level of defenisve stuff when it goes live either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xarilok</div><div class="date">08-26-2004, 11:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm, SoL Defensive AA = 1AA per 1%.  PoP = 3AA per 1%.  I guess OoW will be 9AA per 1%...<br />
<br />
So, yea, lets all get 27AA just to get the same thing we got from getting from CA1 to CA2.<br />
<br />
Innate AGI will be a better return on the AA for avoidance if they keep up the absurd costs of AA like they had with GoD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bonequest</div><div class="date">08-27-2004, 12:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am currently a 6666 unbuffed hp warrior (not all my augs are in my magelo) with 191AA and I am full elemental and KT flagged.  I am not a whole lot better equiped than a 5.5k warrior with 100AA.  A level 65 with 5.5k and 100 AA can get 8 AA in one day in HoH --I have done it before so I know it can be done.<br />
<br />
As for all the mobs in PoP being green to 70--there are lots of red con to 65 mobs in places like Tactics to exp on if that is all you can access.  However--level 70 will make you move to GoD because passing the trials will be easier at 70--even for a casual player.<br />
<br />
I am 95% certain that a level 70 5k+ hp 100+ AA warrior will be more than adequate to group in any of the sewers trials, vxed, tipt, KT, and Ikknz and will get far better experience in those single group zones than in any PoP zone so far.  A lot of the mobs in these zones are yellow and red so they will not be a lot different experience to a level 70 compared to a level 65.  Vxed and Tipt are something like 5% AA per kill and level 70 people will plow through them if the difference between 65 and 70 is comparable to the difference between 60 and 65.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not precisely sure of the point in telling anyone here to grind AA's come OoW and start saving for them. People who need to Save for AA's probably won't be able to purchase OoW AA's come their release, and those that haven't probably already banked 30 and have 400-800 in their spend pull already.</div></div><hr />

IE: you can buy the first level at 65 .. 2nd at 67 3rd at 69 ... 4th and 5th at 70.<br />
<br />
Still, though, now that i finally finished my marshall title i'm starting to bank by 30 in preparation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">didiaquarr</div><div class="date">08-27-2004, 10:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I take the point about saving up for AA.  Personally I'm not going to head to 70 right away.  I agree with Haass on this one.  In PoP it was a signifcant shift when you dinged 61.  I am going to wait until folks I play with day to day actually check it out a little and/or there's some feedback on the web about the consequences of dinging 66.  What's the point if all the stuff where you normally hunt is all of a sudden green?  Or crappy xps?  <br />
<br />
Actually, come to think of it, I think I'll hold off on buying the entire expansion until I get this feedback.  In the meantime, sure... if you don't have anything you want to buy, save 'em up.  Personally I'm only at around 130 AA, and have really just finished the defensive slog.  I'll be probably buying some fun quick ones as a little reward.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, well people thought the normal XP spots outside of PoP would still be viable, and that turned out to be wrong too.  Whether it's blue or not isn't the question..it's whether they move your bar fast enough to be worth killing them.<br />
<br />
I think a lot of people are gonna get burned, just like PoP, and they're gonna come here and cry about it again because they haven't learned their lesson.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">08-27-2004, 04:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The best XP spots were still viable .. and are still viable.<br />
<br />
The xp flow never changed 1 bit unless mobs went light blue ... PoP xp rate simply eclipsed anything else before it, so all the old stompin grounds are now vacant.<br />
<br />
An aa takes the same time to do in UP at 65 as it did at 60.  The same is true with SSra and the other higher end Luclin zones.  Sure, FG may not be solo/duoable for xp, but then again they weren't all that hot in the first place.<br />
<br />
You're selling yourself short if you're not leveling to 70.  If you wanna stay in BoT at 65 forever be by guest, but the xp rate at 70 wont be any less.  Me?  I'll be leveling to 70, buying the new defensive aa, and hanging out in OoW for xp.  My guess is that xp will be truely phenomenal in the new zones (none of which are locked saved the raiding zones).</div></div><hr />

There is only 1 keyed zone in OOW.</div></div><hr />

<br />
After an hour in GoD, I'm so tired of the same 4 or 5 mobs that I have trouble staying awake. When that happens, I'm able to hustle over to Cazic Thule to spank lizardmen, or head to Po&lt;whatever&gt; for some variety, and still get pretty darn good exp. At level 70, I think your good exp choices will be narrower.</div></div><hr />

<br />
After an hour in GoD, I'm so tired of the same 4 or 5 mobs that I have trouble staying awake. <br />
<br />
<br />
And this is different than LDoN and PoP ... or pretty much any expansion how?  Any camp you decide to take for xp will have the same mind-numbing 3-4 models.<br />
<br />
I imagine the average group xp flow rate will increase about as much as it did from PoP to GoD for the masses.  From the looks of things, there will also be a great deal more for the casual player here as well, with all the zones unlocked.  Sure, there will be some bad-ass shit you need high-end gear for, but this should only be expected.<br />
<br />
I really dont know where some of you are getting the doom and gloom about the new expansion from.<br />
<br />
If there is a problem with OoW, it will be because Sony produces and distributes a broken, half complete ... fucked up expansion.  Not because you can no longer hunt in PoJ, PoI, and PoD for xp.  Seriously folks, PoS/V + will still be dark blue and good for xp.<br />
<br />
I think some people are worried for all the wrong reasons.  Heaven forbid they twist your arm into making you group in different places because the xp is better there.  I dont understand how anybody can hunt BoT.  It is mind-numbing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">08-27-2004, 06:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The xp flow never changed 1 bit unless mobs went light blue ...

<br />
This is 100% false.<br />
<br />
The kennels in chardok were absolutely ridiculous XP, could do an AA in 2 hours or so in a full group (before group bonus) during luclin at 60.<br />
<br />
At 61, the XP rate dropped about 50%.  You can't even argue it didn't, because I saw it first hand since Cagna was 61 and Haass continued to grind AA's at 60.  That's why there's a 20 AA difference between them now.<br />
<br />
All of the mobs at the kennels are still dark blue to 65.  If you're not a raider, and you can't access high XP zones, or have access to a high XP group, you're gonna be shooting yourself in the foot, just like everyone did when PoP opened.<br />
<br />
We saw SO many people quit shortly after PoP opened.  They were 65, and had nothing to do and the game wasn't fun anymore.  It's gonna happen again if people don't learn from their mistakes....people being either SoE, or their customer base.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apolyon</div><div class="date">08-27-2004, 06:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">An aa used to take me 3 hours in UP on my ranger in a decent group.  At 65 i can get an aa in about 2 hours.  The xp per mob didn't drop drastically, but the kill rate increased quite a bit.<br />
<br />
Zones like Fungus grove, on the other hand, became completely obsolete.<br />
<br />
I've not spent much time in charkdok kennels, so i can't comment on that.  AA grinding at 65 is much easier than it ever was at lv 60 in luclin.  Nightmare, Disease, and even Innovation were amazingly fast xp compared to before, and once you broke into Valor and Storms it went through the roof.<br />
<br />
I'd say they already learned from their mistakes on the flagging and locked zones Haass ... there's only 1 or 2 out of a whole slew of new areas to hunt.   Now let's just pray they dont fuck us over with broken content and half-completed zones/encounters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">08-27-2004, 07:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">AA grinding at 65 is much easier than it ever was at lv 60 in luclin.

<br />
You're missing what I'm saying. <br />
<br />
Before PoP, where did people LIKE to hunt? <br />
<br />
Seb<br />
HS<br />
Chardok<br />
Akheva<br />
and to a lesser extent<br />
Velks<br />
FG<br />
<br />
Are any of those viable XP spots at 65? No, they're not.  The mobs are still blue.  The zones are still fun, but the XP is fucking crap.  And it was a LONG time before normal people could get a decent XP rate in Nightmare, and Valor and Storms weren't an option for even longer.  Normal people weren't just getting an AA an hour in BoT when PoP opened you know. Only once people became overgeared for the expansion did the XP rates increase<br />
<br />
The same thing is going to happen with OoW.  If you think you're geared for OoW, you're wrong (not you in particular Apolyon, just in general).  You're gonna get your ass kicked, and you're not gonna be pulling down 2 aa's an hour when you're undergeared for the content.  9 months down the road...sure.  But what are you gonna do until then?  You can't go back to Valor, XP is gonna suck.  So then what do you do?<br />
<br />
This shit has happened before, it's gonna happen again.  Look at the steep power curve mobs are taking.  Shit in OoW isn't just gonna start hitting for 1250 instead of 1200, it's gonna be 1800, and you're not gonna be able to handle it until you get your shielding or whatever the new gimmick is for tanking this bullshit in this expansion.<br />
<br />
If you're gonna go to 70, unless you're in a very high end guild, with a very skilled group of players, I can fucking GUARANTEE that your xp rate is going to suffer.  There are always people who are going to be able to do the new content right away, but they are not the norm.</div></div><hr />

Until then, I'll keep grinding out AA.  I don't have so many (only about 180, currently saving for WA5 /twitch) that there's nothing good to buy, by any means.  ;)<br />
<br />
If I do decide to level past 65, I'll take the road I did before: Get a level, get some AA, get to the next level.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My advice is to get the current defensive AA available now and if you already have those then save 30 for the OoW expansion.  After OoW comes out then go full regular exp to 70 and then do AA progression.  <br />
<br />
Rule of thumb has always been LVLS &gt; AA  (for a warrior at least) Increased damage mitigation being at lvl 66 will be better than being 65 and doing AA grinding.<br />
<br />
Besides....  I can guarantee you that it will be tougher to get an exp group at lvl 65 than 70 once a month has passed after OoW comes out.</div></div><hr />

BoT is higher, north PoV is higher, Tactics is definitely higher.  All that matters is zone exp modifier (if they still exist in the same sense as before) and monster level (being within 5 lvls of the monster is a big bonus).  OoW will most definiteily produce zones that are better in both regards.  I am sure there will be places for &quot;normal&quot; people to get exp at a better rate than can be had in BoT.<br />

Once sales figures are met, the plat drops on low-level mobs can be nerfed if the plat infusion is heating up the economy too much. Cf fishing in GoD.<br />
I'm not sure they'll have to nerf exp in places like PoJ or PoD; all they need is for a few people to say of Omens &quot;OMG i dinged/AA'd in 30 seconds the exp is insane here1111&quot; or &quot;Woot! Got 4 BDs in 10 minutes!&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
i agree they arent likely to green out. but being deep blue they will be poor enough experience that rate of aa gain in these zones will take a significant hit if we level up to 70 but do not move on to higher zones.<br />
<br />
my issue with level 70 is that the newer the expansion the greater the lag. since GoD is too laggy for me to pull in (i cant turn around fast enough) i expect oow to be the same or worse and therefore even though i COULD level faster there the frustration of the lag would make me hate the game too much to want to go that route.<br />
<br />
Haass -  whatever happened to your plan to check out GoD? you started a whole thread on that subject - but i lost the thread. i know i tried it and found the mobs werent bad at all but then i was only doing yard trash. so ... whats the verdict?</div></div><hr />
