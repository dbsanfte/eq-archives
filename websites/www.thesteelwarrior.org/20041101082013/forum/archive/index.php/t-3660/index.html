<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sarevok Gibran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i have a sword of the bloodsworn and copper hammer or striking....the copper hammer does way more dmg but only stuns mobs up to level 45 the sword does less dmg with proc but stuns mobs up to 66 which should i put in??<br />
<br />
ive noticed the hamemr procs A LOT more when i put in in main hand then when sword is in main hand so im not sure any opinions would be appreciated, thanx</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Stun is good agro whether it lands or not. I have both of these weapons and I use hammer main, sword off and have very few problems with agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sarevok Gibran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">the max level for the stun is 45 so if it procs on a mob above 45 the stun just doesnt work so no aggro is gained, thats why im wondering if i should mainhand the sword</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not true at all.  The aggro is still gained whether the mob is immune to the stun or not.  In fact, the aggro is still gained even if the proc is completely resisted.  That is why you should use the CHOS in mainhand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wompem Ondahed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">/Agree Sassinak. The proc stuns upto lvl 55, btw, but the aggro is there no matter what. Take for example Venril Sathir: I made an executive decision to have out paladin tank him ( forgive me brothers I know it is blasphemy) and had her spam stun Cease and Desist ( lvl 9 and 14? stuns). End result: We all went full offensive and burned him down in 30 seconds, maybe 1 minute.<br />
<br />
Btw, VS can't be stunned by those two spells, but the aggro lock was 100%.</div></div><hr />
