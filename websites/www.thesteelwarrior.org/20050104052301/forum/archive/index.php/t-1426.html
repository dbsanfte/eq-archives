<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">akamek</div><div class="date">06-22-2003, 03:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey guys, I have a couple options that I'd like to ask ya'll about.  First off here is my magelo.<br />
<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=484453  <br />
<br />
My main question is this.  I have the option to buy a nice 1hb from a guildie for about 1500pp.  The 1hb is a Scorn Edged Mace<br />
its 14/25 7sv fire and magic, 20hp and the unneeded 20 mana.  I would put that secondary and sell my LSoEE for around 6k.  I'd make a profit of around 4500 in that and could put that towards other upgrades.  <br />
<br />
So it's either keep LSoEE or sell it and make the money and buy some upgrades and thats where I have the real problem.  I know if I miss the LSoEE I'll just be able to buy another but as for upgrades I dunno what to buy.  My bracers aren't that great but I plan to upgrade those to BoB's very soon.  I see either a haste upgrade such as a Shadowy Assasins Sash/SoDB upgrade and then just see what hands MQ Or something I can pick up or an ear upgrade such as a Solstice earing or a spider fang earing.  <br />
<br />
Oh well if any of you have some suggestions please send em my way.  <br />
<br />
*EDIT.  My 2hander atm is a Tae Ew Twohanded sword incase anyone was wondering that lol.<br />
<br />
Later all, Akamek</div></div><hr />
