 parses about 10 dps higher than dbotw and dod offhand.  About 10 over blade of war also, dont have vanazir to parse against, but i have heard its marginally better.</div></div><hr />

If you were just fighting toe to toe vs someone, using a weapon with a higher base damage is very helpful, since you'll minimize ripostes, and he will take a lot more riposte damage :)<br />
<br />
Keep in mind PC's do 80% more riposte damage than NPC if they have not been slacking on AA ability.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 I believe he did. And that's not too uncommon considering the droprate of the DoD. I was using a DoD in offhand for quite awhile, as well as Bloodfrenzy and Stone Etched Mallet, depending on the situation. Now I got an EoE so it doesn't matter. :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seriously, i could see using a DoD MAYBE as a non aggro weapon if you had a major problem controlling your aggro when you arent tanking, but using a DoD to tank is like shooting yourself in the foot heh.</div></div><hr />

Anyway the parses are obviously not done with high attack buffs and high ratio low delay 2handers are known to be better with more attack.  If you're using Cranial Bludgeoner you'd definitely get SoP Avatar etc...  Also don't forget the proc is probably around 15 DPS by itself (assume no resists, 3 procs/minute, probably lower due to dots overlap and not getting the full effect)<br />
<br />
I really can't imagine Cranial Bludgeoner + 4 damage augment from the same raid losing to any warrior usable DPS combination.  I mean, that's 45/24 right there...</div></div><hr />

The 45/24 beats the 64/38 by a significant margin.  Adding augment only helps the CB more because the amount of damage added is constant (4) but CB is much faster than the VDD.<br />
<br />
DS damage is pretty insignificant to a Warrior who always gets healed by CH anyway.  I mean it's not like classes that DW mysteriously die to every mob that ever has a DS, unless you're talking about the 600 DS guys in trial 2 in Ikkinz, but obviously you'd switch out for a slower 2H for those guys.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My point is, that if you are using a Blade of War, and he is using a Cranial Bludgener, what will 'skew' the damage you do to each other will be that the riposte damage you two do to each other will be uneven.<br />
<br />
- Blade of war swings X1 times / minute<br />
- Cranial Bludgener swings X2 times/minute<br />
- Blade of war against a warrior with maxed double riposte resulsts in Z1 ripostes/minute (function of delay only)<br />
- Cranial Bludgener results in Z2 ripostes/minute<br />
- Blade of War average  hit is equal to Y1<br />
- Cranial bludgener average hit is equal to Y2<br />
<br />
Therefore - while melee DPS would be just (X1 * Y1) vs (X2 * Y2) (excluding proc DPS) the 'damage' you would deal each other in a duel would be ((x1+y1) + (z2*y1) ) vs ((x2*y2) + (z1 *y2)) and z2*y1 &gt;&gt; z1 * y2</div></div><hr />

Clearly you failed math class horribly.  I parsed dod offhand, because eoe sucks,  The dps is a marginal increase over frenzy, and the aggro is a downgrade + i use shield when tanking so no point wasting the dkp + the dod was free.  However yes cb did parse about 10 over dbotw and dod.</div></div><hr />

Explain to me how a 20/20 ratio weapon, in a skill that we cap at 250 at ( 1hs ), sucks, and a 18/20 weapon that we cap at 240 at, would make for better dps when parsed.<br />
<br />
Im not seeing the connection here, however i think you're horribly mistaken when you say an EoE sucks.  And based on your previous comments where you said you dont even have an EoE because you always use a shield when tanking, how would you even know?<br />
<br />
In fact id probably bet money a DBoTW / EOE combo parses higher in dps then a DBoTW / DOD combo.</div></div><hr />

Any warrior who uses a piercer as a primary or an offhand when skill caps at 240 is going to turn out lower dps than someone using a DboTw + EoE or Onyx staff by a noticable amount. Still waiting for a decent 2hander to come ou of GoD thats war usuable but so far theres been no luck !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantron</div><div class="date">04-19-2004, 04:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">People have way too much faith in damage bonus.<br />
<br />
A SK using the 49/31 one hander which has a ratio of 1.58 can almost outdamage my Vanazir, despite having lower attack than Warriors.  Just think about that for a minute.  41/24 is roughly 8% better ratio than a 49/31 with identical (well, actually 41/24 has 1 higher damage bonus than a 49/31 1hander) damage bonus.  <br />
<br />
If they have a 2 hander that was say, 41/4, you'll still have people saying it sucks because the damage bonus is only 14, and some people will mysteriously kill themselves using this weapon on a 600 DS mob in Ikk trial 2 and then say this weapon was inferior to use than whatever's out there.<br />
<br />
I live by VDD, since I am the only one who uses it on a raid.  The DPS added from the proc alone makes it outdamage just about any other weapon (if AC debuff adds even 1 DPS per melee, that's still way more DPS than any other weapon I could use consider the number of melee present at a raid).  But damage bonus does not make a weapon.<br />
<br />
And for the same person comparing the difference in damage and delay?  You're the one who needs help on math, badly.  Vanazir is 60/38.  Now let's say hypothetically, we have this weapon that is a 20/1, 2hander.  Let's see... 40 less damage, but 37 better delay.  Obviously a 20/1 is worse than a Vanazir?  Never mind a 20/1 does 140 DPS (assuming 50% hit rate, always double, so 10 hits per second at 14 damage bonus = 140 DPS from damage bonus) before you even think about the ratio?  <br />
<br />
Some actual math on DPS... from the parse posted on Vanazir at http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?postid=52307#post52307, it'd extrapolate to 160 DPS if fully hasted (test only has 41% self haste).  The average hit per second is 0.58 which is 23.3 DPS from damage bonus.  Given VDD is 40 DB 38 delay, we can extrapolate the DPS from damage bonus of CB (14 DB 24 delay) to be 12.9 DPS.  Now that damage bonus is taken care of, and we ignore proc (though certainly CB's proc outdamages VDD easily).  CB is 8% better ratio, so it will do 1.08 X (160-23.3) = 147.6 DPS, and then add the 12.9 DPS from damage bonus, we get 160.5 DPS.<br />
<br />
I don't know how you can say 60/38 is &quot;obviously better&quot; when you haven't even done some minimal math on the weapons.  Any attack buffs will only push DPS in favor of CB since DPS from damage bonus is not affected by attack buffs.  A Shining Bloodstone augment will also push DPS in favor of CB because CB is faster than VDD.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would just like to further reinforce what Phantron has said by stating that you are horribly wrong, Celestias.  A weapon that is 150dmg 120dly is not better than a vanazir...even though its 30dmg higher than delay versus 22dmg higher than delay.<br />
<br />
Phantron's above post further proves that CB is better than VDD (I was just about to do the same thing he did, but he beat me to it &gt;&lt;)</div></div><hr />

My estimation would put it at roughly the same DPS using tanking-buffs.  But if you want a dedicated DPS weapon (get appropriate buffs, augment, etc), I don't see how a much superior ratio weapon like CB will lose to VDD.<br />
<br />
Though I don't know if my guild's situation is unique, but if you're the only one using a VDD, your DPS increases a lot just due to the fact that the effect of the debuff increases the DPS of every melee (even pets) on the raid.</div></div><hr />

You missed the point.  The point is that 2 more dmg on an offhand weapon will do jack and shit for my dps.  Offhand dps is so miniscule to begin with that taking the hit on an eoe is pointless, when A bloodfrenzy is more aggro, B dod is free and marginally less dps, and C god is out and there will be far better weapons.</div></div><hr />

There's a difference between marginal and none.  The issue is offhand aggro vs offhand dps.  Which is why you'd use a weapon over a shield.<br />
<br />
A) From practical use, it's significantly more then minor, when I was using DBOW/*UNAUGED BF* I had to be REALLY careful vs *TWO* people with DBOW/*AUGGED* EOE.<br />
<br />
B) Let's look at 10DPS for a moment...  Assuming you're doing about 160-170 DPS in your Plane of Time Gear using EoE and something else equally good, you're saying that 2 pts of weapon damage is 6% of your total DPS. (In the offhand only.)  I think you will need to do the math here :(  Extrapolating that out backwards, your offhand is doing 66% of the damage of your character...<br />

So the offhand was contributing far less than 66% of the total -- even with sinister strikes. No doubt, if I didn't have maximum flurry AA it would be a higher % but I doubt it would ever approach 50% (and obviously not 66%)<br />

So the offhand was contributing far less than 66% of the total -- even with sinister strikes. No doubt, if I didn't have maximum flurry AA it would be a higher % but I doubt it would ever approach 50% (and obviously not 66%)<br />
<br />
Slash was 20/20 and Pierce was 18+3 cold dmg/20<br />
<br />
I was countering Daabu's Assertation that an EoE offhand would do 10DPS more then a DoD.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you look at the results of my parse above, in pure melee terms,<br />
<br />
Pierce DPS / (Slash DPS + Pierce DPS) = 42.38%<br />
<br />
So the offhand was contributing far less than 66% of the total -- even with sinister strikes. No doubt, if I didn't have maximum flurry AA it would be a higher % but I doubt it would ever approach 50% (and obviously not 66%)<br />
<br />
Slash was 20/20 and Pierce was 18+3 cold dmg/20<br />
<br />
<br />
I never said you'd deal 66% of your damage, or even 50% of your damage.  I said your offhand swings more than 50% of the time (meaning, if you swing X times with it in your primary, you will swing more than X/2 times with it in your offhand).  Damage calculation is very different from offhand to main hand because of damage bonus, so of COURSE a 50% swing rate will not be equivalent to a 50% increase in DPS.<br />
<br />
One problem I see with your parsing, Dinian, is that you're comparing the off-hand dps of a weapon we dont have maximum skill.  It isnt a big difference, but it definately could make an impact.<br />
<br />
Because my math-estimates has been challenged, I decided to do some pre-emptive calculations (we'll see exactly how close or far I am through Dinian's parsing tonight)<br />
<br />
Some math comparing an 18/20 and a 20/20 in offhand:<br />
<br />
&quot;Magic Number&quot; hits:<br />
18/20: 18*2 =36<br />
20/20: 20*2 = 40<br />
<br />
Taking into consideration a lower weapon skill (assuming its linear):<br />
Magic Number: (240/250)*(18*2) = 35<br />
<br />
If we assume that our Magic Number is our average damage, we can assume that our offhand DPS will increase roughly 14% (40/35=1.1428...).<br />
<br />
Using Dinian's 46.52 offhand DPS out of 109.78 total melee DPS, we achieve:<br />
<br />
Modified offhand DPS: 46.52*(40/35)=53.16 DPS.  <br />
Increase in DPS (melee only): 53.16-46.52=6.64DPS<br />
<br />
Add in a 1.5 proc-per-minute from the EoE (150dmg*1.5 / 60) = 3.75 DPS from the EoE proc and now we're at a 10.39DPS increase.<br />
<br />
Note that Dinian did not have max haste.<br />
<br />
<br />
Please tell me how your extrapolation of numbers yields an offhand increase of 10dps equating to 66% of damage being dealt by offhand?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Still, though, there is a difference between a 18/20 and 20/20 offhand weapon, and while it may not relate to a DoD (because a DoD can effectively be a 21/20 weapon) it's not insignificant from a dps perspective.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thought it was above...  Assuming total DPS with with 20 base weapon is 160 and that's 10 more DPS then without (150), then the increase is a 6.25%.  Now, then if you had a 14/20 weapon and it scaled you'd have 140DPS, 12/20, 120 DPS, 10/20, 110DPS... till you reached 0/20 which would be at 70 DPS.  You'd then see using your numbers that your offhand was doing 160-70/160 or 66% of your damage.  Now the 160DPS duel wield is a number that was just thrown out there, much like the 10 DPS difference is a number that is just thrown out there.  But I'm sure tomorrow's parsing will show both are equally absurd :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mearis</div><div class="date">04-21-2004, 05:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmm, I am not quite sure how people are confused about this:<br />
<br />
Aspit said that:<br />
<br />
- Blood Frenzy is higher aggro (but less DPS) than an EoE, therefore looting an EoE is not worth it for aggro purposes<br />
<br />
- DoD is 'close enough' in DPS to EoE so that when he wishes to use dual wield without aggro'ing he will use DBoTW and DoD<br />
<br />
- When tanking hard hitting mobs, he uses a shield plus a DBoTW<br />
<br />
Phantron and Gloree proved using some really straightforward math that a cranial bludgoner is a better DPS weapon than a Vanazyr, and the gap is likely to widen with higher aTK buffs, but Vanazyr might be better due to the AC debuff component of the proc.<br />
<br />
Some people seem to confuse<br />
a) Overstate EoE vs DoD dps in offhand<br />
b) The 10 points difference in skill in between piercing<br />
c) The % of damage due to the damage bonus of a weapon at high ATK levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daabu</div><div class="date">04-21-2004, 07:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mearis, I'm not confused at all -- we sorta derailed from the OP.<br />
<br />
I scoffed at this quote:<br />
Clearly you failed math class horribly. I parsed dod offhand, because eoe sucks, The dps is a marginal increase over frenzy, and the aggro is a downgrade + i use shield when tanking so no point wasting the dkp + the dod was free. However yes cb did parse about 10 over dbotw and dod.<br />
<br />
An EoE's dps is not a &quot;marginal&quot; increase over a bloodfrenzy (16/19 with no damage proc vs 20/20 with a proc), its dps is even about 10 higher than the dod.  He said the weapon sucked and implied that dod is a better choice to equip than an eoe.  We're debating whether his assertion is true.</div></div><hr />

The proc is 3.75dps in offhand [(1ppm x 0.5 from WA) x 150damage] / 60sec. Assuming its never resisted (it is basically never except on mobs with very high resists, time snap is neg 300 magic based.)<br />
+ a 0.0 sec stun vs mobs up to lvl 68 which can be neat to interrupt gating or CHing expmobs. <br />
+ roughly the agro of anger2 from the proc (very rough estimate, be careful with that. I also understand you don't always want the agro. The DoD wielder made clear that he used DoD when not MTing.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">04-21-2004, 01:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aspit, in his own hit 'em in the face with the facts way, is correct in his ascertion. EoE is NOT an agro upgrade over a BF. Anyone who would argue otherwise is simply not looking at the facts. It would take a whole lot more than 10 or 20 DPS to overcome the advantage of having a proc modifier on an EB weapon. Augments are irrelevant because they cancel each other out. What you have left is an EoE with a standard proc rate and a proc that is roughly equal to A2 vs. a BF with an increased proc rate EB proc. It's a no brainer. EoE is better for stats and DPS, but looting it as an agro weapon when you already own a BF is really not an upgrade at all.<br />
<br />
The reasoning is sound. Most guilds are letting DoDs rot within a month of getting in to Time. In most cases you can pick up a DoD for little or no DKP. If you want a DPS weapon, why would you spend DKP on an EoE when you can just get a DoD for free? Depending on the situation, the difference in DPS will ne negligible.<br />
<br />
I would be interested to see just how much difference there is in agro between an EoE vs. BoC. Again, the superior proc of the BoC might make it a waste of DKP to loot an EoE unless you really need the stats. The exception would be if the DPS of an EoE would be enough to overcome the difference in proc agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dinian</div><div class="date">04-21-2004, 01:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think you are downplaying the amount of aggro one achieves simply by doing more damage over time.<br />
<br />
A 20/20 weapon is WAY more damaging than a 16/20 weapon. Yes, I understand all about the proc on the bloodfrenzy.<br />
<br />
I'm just saying... simply aug'd with Ykesha my EoE+Ykesha mainhand puts out enough agro that I very  rarely need swap out for my Blade of War+Anger3 in xp groups with my own guildmates.<br />
<br />
Raids are another story.<br />

Update on the DoD/EoE parse... the patch last night interrupted it so results will have to wait until tomorrow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daabu</div><div class="date">04-21-2004, 03:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was never contesting the aggro.  Yes, a bloodfrenzy (or even a BoC, for that matter) will generate more aggro than an EoE.  But, we were talking about DPS weapons.<br />
<br />
DoD can't interrupt level 68 mob's spells<br />
DoD does NOT put out the same DPS as an EoE.  An EoE will have a DPS upgrade greater than any single AA one can buy.<br />
<br />
Would I grab a DoD were one to be rotting and it was free?  Sure.<br />
Would I let it keep me from getting an EoE when one is available to me?  Not at all.  EoE is still the preferred weapon.</div></div><hr />

Proc rates are equal, hate from BoC proc is 700, hate from EoE proc is ---? debateable.  Some put it around Anger 2 which is 400 hate.  I'd probably put it a little higher than that.  EoE outputs 33% more dps (15dmg versus 20dmg) than BoC, which, imo, would more than make up for the 300 (max) less pure hate per proc.  The proc mod on Bloodfrenzy probably gives it an edge in aggro over EoE, but I'd take the EoE over it due to stats, ability to interrupt spells on a proc, and higher DPS.</div></div><hr />

Nice info.  It's worth noting as well that with full ATK buffs the damage distribution will be skewed more towards max hit so the low damage bonus becomes even less of a concern.  I just recently got this same weapon setup (CB +4 dmg aug) but haven't gotten around to parsing it yet in a group setup with decent ATK buffs.  The only real info I have on it so far is from some limited raid use (only had it a few days so far).  With VQ and SoP as my only ATK buffs I frequently do over 200 DPS on raid trash mobs.  I should have some better info when I get around to xping in KT with it for awhile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khumak</div><div class="date">07-29-2004, 10:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did a little parsing tonight in KT with CB + 4 dmg aug, 41% haste, maxed offensive AAs except for only 2 levels of Strengthened Strike, VQ, SoT, SoP, Call of Fire, and 28 pts of DS (self DS + CotR).  My unbuffed ATK is 1542.  Forgot to check what it was with buffs but I think around 1780.  I used defensive a few times and didn't use any offensive discs.  I spent a small amount of time out of range or lulled (I hate lull).<br />
<br />
Total 203.4 DPS<br />
Crush 159.8 DPS (78.6%)<br />
Bash 3.3 DPS (1.6%)<br />
DoT 7.7 DPS (3.8%)<br />
proc + DS 32.6 DPS (16.0%)<br />
<br />
I used EQ companion for the parse.  I forgot EQ Companion doesn't separate proc damage from DS so I'll have to try again sometime without any damage shields to get a more accurate estimate on proc damage.  Average crush damage per hit was 187.  Would be interesting to see how much that changes at various levels of ATK.</div></div><hr />
