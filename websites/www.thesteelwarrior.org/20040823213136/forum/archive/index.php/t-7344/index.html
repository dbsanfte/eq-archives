<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okies, OoW is getting delayed to fix problems. No doubt, the developers have a nice loooong list of what they think the most pressing problems are BUT I'll bet ya a jelly donut they are wrong.<br />
<br />
So I thought I'd start a thread with the reasons people quit EQ as the primary measure of what needs fixing.<br />
<br />
1. They are stalled or their guild is stalled. The need to make content challanging and to limit the rewards causes players to feel like they are mashing a wall with their heads sometimes. That's good insofar as it helps make content last and gives people a sense of accomplishment. It's bad when players quit and guilds fall apart.<br />
<br />
Flags should regulate guild access to raiding content, not individual player access to those raids or to zones,<br />
<br />
Offer more interim rewards. A guilde that tries and fails 10 times on RZ and doesn't get a BoC should still get something for their trouble.<br />
<br />
EQ can be frustrating for weeks and sometimes months on end. People do not log in if they aren't having fun.<br />
<br />
2. Rewards are almost always marginal improvements and beyond the reach of most players that can only play for 2-4 hours a week. Add to this the fact that it takes many many marginal improvements to notice a difference and the majority of players log off nightly with no sense of progress or accomplishment.<br />
<br />
It's hard to believe a 40HP aug is an appropriate reward for 1150 Adv Points/51*30 minutes of your life. At the higher end we see 52 players*4 hours for a Curly-toed Shoe Sword and maybe a 70HP aug if your guild is lucky.<br />
<br />
One possible improvement might be non-persistant rewards. I'd see nothing wrong with a 20/20 1H Slash that dropped from a random mob in KC for example that poofed when you logged. For mid-level players there are already some ok summoned items. There's no reason other environment appropriate temporary items can't be dropped.<br />
<br />
3. Classes feel they don't contribute in raids and have difficulty getting flaged to attend them.<br />
<br />
Guilds should be flagged for raid access, not individuals.<br />
<br />
In the Wariror/Knight debacle. Knights can not obviate the need for Warriors in raids, especially in new cutting edge content. But they should not feel useless.<br />
<br />
Red splits, multiple named, etc. I concider primarily Warrior tanking territory. This gives Warrior #3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 something to do in raids.<br />
<br />
Yellow adds, Blue adds, backup on Red Splits, plow tanking, etc. I concider Knight territory. They ought to have the best tools for doing this. SK's ought to debuff and cripple mobs effectively. Paladins ought to have a significant Combat Medic role.<br />
<br />
Some of the content is soooo difficult and designed in such a way that classes are marginalized.<br />
<br />
Hard !&gt; Fun. Learn it and believe it.<br />
<br />
4. What is it with tradeskills? Why are most items crap (there are notable exceptions), components come from very advanced zones, and agnostics left out in the cold?<br />
<br />
+50HP Food ought to be reasonably easy to make ~200 skill.<br />
10 DMG player made arrows ought to be as well.<br />
<br />
I understand that player made armor can't fairly compete with boss mob drops. But consumables can. How about a DA potion, Clarity, Greater Heal, etc. Set level limits for use.<br />
<br />
5. I'm going to repeat. Mind Boggling Hard != Fun and Grind != Fun. Two hour raids are teh bomb. 5 hour raids are idiotic.<br />
<br />
Sorry this is so long. Prolly not worth reading the whole thing. But the point is valid. To some extent, SoE just doesn't get it and shows no sign of understanding it. Maybe assigning a designer assistant to to play 30 hours a week for 4 years would give them a different perspective - /shrug.<br />

<br />
Player made armor may not fairly compete with boss mob drops, from the more recent or even the second most recent expansion.  But it sure shouldn't only be allowed compete with boss mob drops from 4 or 5 expansions ago and for which there are numerous droppable equivalents already in the bazaar.  Player made armor hasn't made any realistic progress since cultural came out at the end of Luclin.  Sure, there are different armors to be made, but none of which surpass cultural except using rare elemental drops that almost no one can get.</div></div><hr />
