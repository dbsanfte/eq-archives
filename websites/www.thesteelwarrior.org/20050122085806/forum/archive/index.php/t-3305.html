<br />
I've given into my anger over knights.<br />
<br />
I'm tried of pussy footing armound saying &quot;don't nerf knights&quot; just fix warriors and then being told that Warriors shouldn't be the best tank when that's all I freaking do.<br />
<br />
I don't want warriors balanced any longer, I don't want better taunt or better mitigation, I don't want any upgrades at all.<br />
<br />
What I want is simple, nerf the knight classes back to fucking Kunark. <br />
<br />
I want every Knight to wake up one day and find they can't equip their gear becuase it is now WAR only, they can't equip it until they turn it into a GM and get in return slightly buffed Kunark class armor. <br />
<br />
I want every knight to have their casting and swinging timers rehooked, their mana pools slashed, and their hybrid penalitys reinstated.<br />
<br />
I think that is finally a solution that SOE can get onboard with.<br />
<br />
DISCLAIMER: Not really, I just wanted to see what it was like to be a reactionary idiot like the posters on PoN. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
We're working on gettting more of &quot;teh funney&quot; into it. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xiliz</div><div class="date">09-29-2003, 02:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Naw,<br />
Just remove their channeling abilities.<br />
that way they can't cast spells while being hit, which would force them to use their taunt buttons...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">daoga</div><div class="date">09-29-2003, 03:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hmmmm removing channelling actually sounds like it would make a dramatic change... but... is this done to ALL hybrids, or just Knights?<br />
<br />
or would dropping channelling to a max skill of 50 be enough, ie the spell MIGHT go off if you are getting hit....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Malek</div><div class="date">09-29-2003, 06:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like the thought it dropping the skill to 50 so it *might* go off just like we have to hope and pray everytime we engage a mob that a proc *might* go off :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">09-29-2003, 06:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nerfing channeling really wouldn't help, since a knight could just wait until the mob goes to someone else, stun it, chain another one and then he'd have the lock, without it ever interupting him.  They could do the same thing on incoming too.  It's not like they need to chain stun when the mob is already on them.<br />
<br />
edit : grammar &gt; me</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">daoga</div><div class="date">09-30-2003, 02:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">hmmmm, the issue is that they can generate more hate faster than a warrior, and can also take the punishment for the most part.  but if we lower the hate from stuns, that nerfs alot of agro weapons....  double the cast times on, reuse time on and chance to fizzle on detrimental spells?<br />
<br />
(i am just throwing ideas out here, i know that these are &quot;easy&quot; fixes to a complicated problem)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marshall</div><div class="date">09-30-2003, 08:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think they should just demolish all the hybrid classes and give teh hybrids options to pick another class for their characters. Rangers can become druids, pala's can be clerics or warriors, SK's can be necros, and so on. :)</div></div><hr />
