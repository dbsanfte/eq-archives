<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Iksargo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My iksar warrior is now level 24 and I think it might be time for some upgrades. his magelo profile is here (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=744031). I am kind of short on money so where could I go to quest or kill stuff for my equipment. My guild is mid level (20-40 mostly).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Calinthalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I honestly don't know, when I was 24 Velious had just come out.  So I dont' really know if there is something better you can hunt out there.  My suggestions as far as equipment in general goes.  Look for HPs, look for Sta.   You can still buy Ry'Gorr and Crusty gear relitively cheap in the bazaar.  Also, see if you can get a friendly enchanter to make you some Velium Fire Wedding Bands.  Those are nice and cheap as well these days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zarg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Not bad for that level at all. Yes, iksar have a hard time equiping like the other races. Check the bazaar - I think you can find some Rygorr armor to fill in some areas. Also look to get rid of the neck piece. Dex and Agi are nice but you need some extra AC there. Other then that don't go insane trolling these boards and seeing what everyone else has. Just get what you can and be happy playing the best race in the game =) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Neck, glimmering mithril torque: ac 15, str 2...100pp<br />
<br />
Finger, Platinum or velium fire wedding rings:  AC 5 or 6, hp's 55 or 65, 200 to 400 pp<br />
<br />
Wrist, bracer of scavenging:  Ac 9 Dex STA 5  200pp<br />
<br />
Weapons:  Centi SS, Shaded blade, smouldering brand and cane of the tranqual can all be had at resonable prices in the bazaar.<br />

To be honest, for your level you are doing very well(much &lt;3 for filth covered boots, I camped them at level 15 and wore them till I was well into my 40's...first peice of gear I ever camped).  As far as buying gear upgrades, bazaar search is your friend.  Look for gear with more AC, more STA and more hp's than you currently have, and if it is affordable, there you go.  Do not worry too much about getting constant upgrades.  If you are not getting beaten down badly, put upgrades off till you have more money, and can afford an upgrade that will last longer.</div></div><hr />
