<br />
what is happening - <br />
<br />
i'll enter a zone and xp using incite and other discs as needed. whenever i succor, port, zone, die or ld my incite disc and any other disc i use in that zone are now unavailable for 60 mins. after the 60 mins everything is fine again.<br />
<br />
i am running 300 stam and the endurance bar is always full when i zone. incite is also ready to use when i zone. so no discs are in use and i'm full endurance.<br />
<br />
my time and date stamp are correct and i run a pentium 3 on dial up.<br />
<br />
anyone know what's up? i'm pretty damn useless if after dieing to a mob i have to wait for an hour for defensive disc or incite.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ragnarz</div><div class="date">12-30-2003, 09:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">so ur saying that the client is using the local clock for timing purposes. hahahaha, thats sure interesting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bonequest</div><div class="date">12-30-2003, 04:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmm if that were true then if someone wanted to extend say thier Furious discipline indefinitely, someone could just make a program that resets the local clock every 5 seconds.  Thats messed up if that is the case.  That would be an exploit though so don't do it.</div></div><hr />

I think there's actually two checks, the first one client side ( to control the buttons being greyed out ) and the second one server side. ( Makes sense if you think about it - do you really want your client to ask the server every second if your disc is ready yet ? ;p )<br />
<br />
My clock is about 10 minutes fast and if I zone while a discipline is recharging it ungreys 10 minutes early, but pressing the button pauses for a bit then gives 'You can't use blah blah for 10 minutes'.<br />
<br />
It's not entirely clock though - I know someone had his defensive disciplines stuck with 18 hour recharge after zoning with one up and his clock was at the correct time.</div></div><hr />
