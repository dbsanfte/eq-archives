<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Khumak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone else notice this lately?  I love LDON because there seems to be a HUGELY expanded pool of available groups compared to PoP.  But a disturbing trend I've noticed lately is that before I get an invite for an LDON group from someone I don't know, frequently I will see them inspect me first.  I assume this is to make sure I have weapons that have decent aggro.<br />
<br />
I have pretty good gear and enough people know me that I get both guild and pickup groups fairly easily but I'm curious how often warriors with crappy aggro weapons stand around getting inspects by potential groups and then no invite?</div></div><hr />

 Welcome to the real world.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Crystara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Dye sorta ruins being able to tell uberness on look, hence why I hate the stuff, so yea people resort to inspecting now, only your weapon will be noticable though now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Greyslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Can't say I've ever had this happen to me. Gotta be annoying thought shouldn't judge someone by there weapons although they do make a big difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I miss the days when people considered it rude to inspect others without permission.  A lot of people are still polite about it, but stuff like that is irritating.    And what I really want to know is why your gear would matter that much anyway in an LDoN adventure (normal adventure anyway).  As long as you're in half decent kit, you should do fine.   The only exception to that is if you have a really poorly balanced group classwise, then you might want to get exceptionally geared people to compensate for lack of a class that you need.</div></div><hr />

Warriors, bah, no clue. My warrior is only level 52, after all. All those other weapons graphics I need to catch up on. And plate mail is plate mail is plate mail.<br />
<br />
(The secret to monk identification resides in the fact that monk loots have shifted so damn much over the past three expansions, and MNK only class armor is radically different from the leather crap we normally get to equip).</div></div><hr />

Some DPS or secondary classes can lfg with nice message &quot;Hard prefered&quot; to get normal groups faster :D. Of course if you have a hard group just pretend you need to log out suddently !</div></div><hr />
