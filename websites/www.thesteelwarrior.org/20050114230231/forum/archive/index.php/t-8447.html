I have done the first GoD Sewer trial and I can tell you this... The mobs on average hit as high as 1140 and some quad. Most are slowable but some are not. For the non slowable ones, It can be a challanging fight. I had around 8kish HP and 1540 AC and almost died twice. Fortitude was the lifesaver both times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hassan</div><div class="date">08-10-2004, 06:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sewer 1 is the hardest trial. Sewer 2 is, in difficulty, not much harder than a Normal LDON (a tad harder, in that the mobs hit harder, but they also die fairly quickly and don't seem to hit as fast).  Sewer 3 is a cakewalk, maybe even easier than 2, but the named in it are a challenge. Sewer 4 is between 1 and 2 in difficulty.<br />
<br />
Qinimi, Barindu, Ferubi and Riwwi will not be a problem to tank, I do all four zones regularily, and I've got slightly better HP and AC than you buffed from the sounds of it. I haven't been further than that, so can't really comment on the rest. I find Riwwi to be the best place...lots of easily accessible named for single groups with good drops.</div></div><hr />

The mobs in those trials are nasty!  And the boss of tipt eats everyone for fun.  Though, I had a friend who tanked his way through tipt with 8.6k hps...he had a cleric, druid and necro in his group, and I assume he was  pretty much chain fast healed the whole time =P</div></div><hr />

I've done 'em all successfully with about your stats and an non-stacked but solid group of friends. With a good chanter you could probably hang in vxed, and with luck maybe even squeeze off a tipt win. It'll beat you silly though.<br />
<br />
Compared to hard ldon: Sewers 1 starts off a bit easier, but gets to hitting a bit harder than hard ldon does. A consistent hard ldon group should be able to win easily enough. Other sewers hit like gimps, they're only tough because you have to get drops, know the right strats, have enough dps, etc.<br />
<br />
Vxed hits significantly harder than hard ldon, and tipt is tougher still.</div></div><hr />

I have 10K buffed, butI still have trouble tanking in mountains because I do not have all my mitigation AAs done.  So it is not just gear, defensive AA is a MUST.<br />

Even with great cleric there are times when the shammy or even the ranger has had to patch on certian mobs. <br />
<br />
I have tried the trials and I cannot MA them at all Period. I have had a amazing chanter on both attempts with various pets and the mobs still beat me down too fast. <br />
<br />
It is about Mitigation and Equiptment both.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassinak</div><div class="date">08-10-2004, 02:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You mentioned that Riwwi is easy as hell, and it is, in the sense that BoT is easy.  The next step up from Riwwi is Barindu/Ferubi/Sewer1.  They are not identical, but they are close to each other in difficulty.  I think they are similar to hard LDON in terms of overall risk, but the risk comes in slightly different ways (spike damage and runners/roamers are the big risks here).  You should give any of those three zones a try, and see how comfortable you are.  Barindu is probably the easiest to just try on a whim.  Later, when those three no longer make you sweat, then you are ready to try tanking in Vxed. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ciae Redemption</div><div class="date">08-10-2004, 03:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">10,719dps and 2226ac, and some of the mobs in Tipt/Vxed have gone through me in an amazing 6 seconds.<br />
<br />
Unless you're talking pre-nerf, or hasted mobs (or kyv/noc, but those are rare enough your cleric can heal defensively on them), that's a very outside chance.<br />
<br />
Riwwi mobs' max hit is around 350-500, depending on where you are. I can solo in Barindu (though not very comfortably). Trash isn't all that hard.<br />
<br />
Have not done the LDoN hard yet but will soon. I have done the first GoD Sewer trial and I can tell you this... The mobs on average hit as high as 1140 and some quad. Most are slowable but some are not. For the non slowable ones, It can be a challanging fight. I had around 8kish HP and 1540 AC and almost died twice. Fortitude was the lifesaver both times.<br />
<br />
Best thing you can do in a high-difficulty group, and one of the main things that separates skilled groups from unskilled, is talking to your cleric. If your cleric is decent, then with the wide damage spikes of Gates mobs, your cleric's healing strategy will always be getting on-the-fly adjustments. Saying little shit like 'unslowable' when an abandoned worker (Sewers) or 'hits hard + ramp' when a noc is inc in mountains means your healer isn't going to be surprised when you take damage faster than normal. Eventually a cleric will learn what mobs need adjustments for, but it takes a few mobs (and a few surprises) if the cleric has never been there before. Then there's weird mobs like tipt cragbeasts, where you'll kill a dozen or so of them and they'll all do normal damage, then get one that does double or more than that for the entire fight, for no reason at all - not hasted, not buffed, nothing.<br />
<br />
I've done sewer2 with nothing but a paladin healing (well overgeared, but still possible), quite easily. Sewers are really varied, and Plant is by far the hardest.<br />
<br />
those hp augs and that bracer in quinimi look juicy :P<br />
<br />
What bracer? Unless I missed something on my list (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=8214), there's no warrior-usable bracer from Qinimi...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">08-10-2004, 04:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you can do BoT, Tactics, etc. then you can handle Riwii, Quinimi, and sewers 2-4.  If you can do LDoN hard you can handle Ferubi, Barindu, and sewer 1.  If Ferubi, Barindu, and Sewer 1 are fairly trivial for you, then you can probably do Vxed.  If Vxed goes well, you can probably do Tipt.  <br />
<br />
If you're getting owned in Tipt with 10.7k hps and 2.2k AC you need to have a talk with either your slower or your healer.  Last night I was actually able to tank 2 (slowed) yellows with one cleric healing me because our backup healer died on the pull.  I used defensive, but that's at 10.3k hps and 1.9k AC, tanking 2 yellow-cons with one healer.  And no we didn't have a pooka with us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redleaf</div><div class="date">08-10-2004, 05:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As the posters said, Tipt and Vxed will probably give you problems.  Even with a bit more than 9k hps I get beat down in both trials when mobs get lucky.  Its possible to do them, you just need really good healing.<br />
<br />
The zones before that will probably be a good bet to start in.  The mobs do not hit as hard nor as fast as in Tipt/Vxed.<br />

Is the difference between shaman to enchanter to bard slowing noticeable, and will IH4 with max healing AAs on a cleric be enough, or do you need better focus effects? I've read that the druid Ro debuffs are very helpful, so do they offset the 5% difference in slow between an enchanter and shaman?<br />
<br />
My warrior weighs in at around 9khp and 1600ac buffed and my usual group of warrior, cleric, druid, enchanter, ranger, and bard has 40 or so high-risk LDoN wins. It sounds like we'll probably need to use a pooka along with weaponshield for the named. We haven't hunted in GoD yet.<br />

You could get another 1khp and 100ac and you are still going to get gang raped in LDoN hard/Sewer 1. Getting LR5/ID5 is going to do you a lot of good. Work on grinding those out ASAP, then worry about effective tanking in GoD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rikam</div><div class="date">08-11-2004, 01:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well thornak my warrior Tanked Vxed with 5800 hp 1200 ac or so. I died maybe 3 times in 2-3 hours. Group makeup was War(me) Cle druid(snaring patch heals) Sham beast bard. All up to Solro or so on our server so the others didn't exactly have awesome gear either. A little later our bard loaded his main who was enc and had pet tank while I jousted to let cle heal pet mainly. Never got to named we were mainly farming the great exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Northerner</div><div class="date">08-11-2004, 05:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It depends on how you go at it.  Ironically, AC starts to matter more in Vxed/Tipt in my experience but if you bring a cleric + shaman/druid then you are in a pretty decent position.  Even better if the cleric has Holy Light.<br />
<br />
The 'standard' Enchanter setup for the mountain trials is the problem really.  With a Chanter in, you are left with War/cle/chanter/Snarer(Dru/Rng)/rezzer/puller.  A Paladin makes the best tanking/stunning choice, a ranger is a solid snarer, a necro is good dps/emergency and so on and so on.  One can (and I have) build a cle/tank/beast/mage/enc/dru group or the like but I tend to shun them as I don't get to play my main that way.  There are a million decent groups for those trials but sadly only a few exceptional ones, and all the non-mutli-chanter ones rely on a beefy or stunny tank.</div></div><hr />

Most Tipt/Vxed groups worth their salt dont use a warrior as a pure tank anyway (other than breaking to the blue pooka).  The only mob that has given me trouble (and lots of it) is the yellow con flinty crag beast...oh man those are not fun.<br />
<br />
In the sewers the only mob that will truly give you trouble is the GoD &quot;coverboy&quot; model (the abandoned worker Ciae referred to).  Cant be slowed but as long as your cler and yourself are ready you'll be fine.<br />
<br />
Barindu, Riwwi etc all should easily be handled provided you have a competent healer.</div></div><hr />

GoD is high risk high reward, you die LOTS but the AA and loot are awesome. <br />
<br />
I had no problems tanking Vxed and Tipt with 10khp and 1620 AC. Having good people with you makes a world of difference.<br />

Feel free to bug me for info. Our little group just has to finish 2 easy sewers now for KT.<br />

<br />
Brutul is right, If you cant do it with 10.7k and 2200 ac somehting else is wrong.<br />
<br />
I am at about 10.5k buffed,  and i was missing shaman/BSS buffs for my last tipt run.  NAd i was at about ~9400 hps, and i did fine. I died a few times to the occasiona mean Quad, but its all part of it.  I died to the Named at the end at 12% and the enc pet finished it off.  Was a rough win bit i did it.<br />
<br />
Now to the guy with no LR/ID your gonna have a hell of a time getting through these.  Mitigation is everything with High DPS mobs. I have never done Sewers 1-4, as i got Smith Rondo from the very begininng.<br />
<br />
KT  Mobs are along Vxxed difficulty, and is a nice change of pace from Tipt.<br />

<br />
thats exactly what i was talking about when i said even at my level i can occasinally get my ass kicked. tipt mobs have the possibility of dishing out some really nasty rounds. <br />
<br />
and slowing in tipt is a tricky thing, if you dont have a shaman and the chanter is charming, theres a very fine line between being able to slow without getting aggro and slowing before the mob is actually dead.</div></div><hr />

You'll kill slower but you'll do okay.  You WILL still die sometimes.  The damage spikes in Vxed/Tipt/KT/Ikkinz can be rather huge even if your AC is high enough for the average to be relatively small.  I'm usually fine with a shaman healing me in KT except on the named but I still get the smack down at least once or twice a night no matter how good the healing is.  In xp groups I'm normally sitting at around 11.5k hps and about 2400 AC.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you're not a raider you'll never be able to tank in GoD because SoE sucks and you'll just die in a dark corner in Najena, alone, whining to your last breath that the game just hasn't been the same since that nasty Kunark expansion.<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
But seriously, going and trying it is the best way to find out.  So much depends on who you're with and what *they're* like, so go with friends.<br />
<br />
In my opinion your defensive AA will matter as much or as more as your AC / HP in pre-KT GoD.</div></div><hr />
