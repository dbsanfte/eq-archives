<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Esvee</div><div class="date">03-08-2004, 07:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guild had a go at this tonight. You need to answer about 8-9 riddles by punching the appropriate button in the right temple. If you get it wrong, you get trained by 3 golems that get progressively harder as you get more wrong answers.<br />
<br />
Won't spoil it by posting answers here, but PM me if you really need them :p<br />
<br />
Afterwards you are able to reach the raid mobs; we took down a Babnoxis clone in a cave called Primal arachnid or something like that. Dropped a nice all/all belt. <br />
<br />
Anybody know of some other mobs worth killing in there?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Derrict</div><div class="date">03-09-2004, 04:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The bugs and Pixxt Suir Mindrider  are the ones that have been found, afaik.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Demorgoth</div><div class="date">03-09-2004, 06:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Got a 30ac aug back there too. <br />
<br />
BTW, have they fixed the naphalm mob back there yet? the one with chain zero delay 3k AEs who is only beatable by sploiting zone geometry to bug the AE out?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kimo_Sabbi</div><div class="date">03-09-2004, 10:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are 3 primal named mobs behind that wall. Don't remember the names off the top of my head, but one is a Spider, Lizard and Insect.<br />
<br />
As to whether they fixed the 3k DD chaining mob, I guess they did. We killed all 3 first try.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tarkas</div><div class="date">03-09-2004, 04:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">He's definitely not fixed yet on my server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">snasty</div><div class="date">03-09-2004, 06:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Really need to turn on spell effects for the Primal Insect. I was waiting for someone to jump up on his back and kill him with a grenade just like in  &quot;Starship Trooper&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dalrek</div><div class="date">03-09-2004, 06:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We killed the version with the chain AE and think others did too. Maybe he wont get fixed</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brodda Thep</div><div class="date">03-09-2004, 10:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They are all easy. You just can't let anyone but the warrior get in AE range of the insect.  I remember trying to run up to it to see just how ad it was.  Got about halfway to the insect then had to turn around and run back.  heh<br />
<br />
And you actually have to answer 12 riddles unless someone had already done part of it.</div></div><hr />

This one goes out to all our Asian subscribers<br />
Atleast according to a druid in my guild.</div></div><hr />
