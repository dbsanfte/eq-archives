<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Amaron</div><div class="date">01-26-2004, 12:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, got to level 13 and am wondering about skill progression.  I've been told to pack my shield away and never use it again once I have dual wield.  And I am supposed to later switch to 2H, I imagine this is the case when I can get an uber weap later in life.  Can I get some confirmation that dual is the ONLY way to go, and when I should look at switching to 2H???<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.  <br />
Newbly back to EQ after 4 yrs....</div></div><hr />

For most of your career, dual wield will be better for aggro and 2h will be better for low aggro DPS. You can pack away your shield for now. You won't likely equip a shield again until you start rampage tanking, although GoD may make 1h + shield viable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Amaron</div><div class="date">01-26-2004, 02:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the info.  As a gnome I don't have uber str but I suppose I should get my 2H skill up to where my 1H is.  I've also been told that damage is capped at 20 until i reach about level 20, then it bumps up to a cap of 30?  Looks like i've been using a slow weapon with a high damage when I should be using a faster one given the cap..  Oh well, much to learn.</div></div><hr />

At least as far as I'm concerned.  Rotate a few weapons around so you keep good skill in a bunch of weapon types.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brabble</div><div class="date">02-02-2004, 05:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I might suggest you do a search on: Ruatha.<br />
Ruatha was a small-race warrior who pointed out that you can switch your shield into your offhand weapon slot inbetween swings as you dual wield and use the shield to bash with. You pop the shield in, bash, and then pop your offhand weapon back in before you swing your weapons again.<br />
Bash (and slam, which large races can do without a shield) has a couple of uses. First, it will interrupt casting mobs; second, the skill cap on bash is higher than on kick; third, it stuns mobs, which can be useful in certain situations (it stops mobs from running to their friends at the end of a fight for a round or two if you hit them from behind, for example).<br />
At level 55, your kicks will also stun, so eventually you'll be ble to stun whether you Ruatha bash or not.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eoden</div><div class="date">02-02-2004, 09:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You never know what weapons will come your way in the future so the best advice has been given already - keep all your skills up if you can.<br />
<br />
Ofcourse once you get a few more levels behind you, you will probably find that as it takes longer to progress through each level you will have more time to work on weapon skills, so dont worry too much if they start to lag behind now.  Also it is worth having one skill maxed before you work on the others because one skill at 100 will serve you better than 4 skills at 50.<br />
<br />
... and even if you do neglect a particular skill with a fast weapon once you are high level with decent dex/agl/str stats it will only take a few days to raise that skill.<br />
<br />
At the moment the most popular weapons in terms of effectiveness and accessability to the 55+ crowd are either the copper hammer of striking + sword of the bloodsworn combo (1hs + 1hb) or the great staff of thunder (2hb) so it will be worth having these skills maxed by the time you get to the 50's (so you have plenty of time to work on them as you go).</div></div><hr />
