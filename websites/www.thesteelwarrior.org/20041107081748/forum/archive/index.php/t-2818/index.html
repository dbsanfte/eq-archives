Paying bulk pp for the home address of the scum who made this comic!<br />
<br />
*edit - converted pic to a link, Woody no likey remote linking</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dovan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well.... before you go blowing off the handle again, try this thread (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=2778) and you'll understand Woody's point of view.  Also if you've followed GU Comics for awhile, you'd also know Woody IS a warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dvus Nme</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yea I know his point of view, EQ classes are unbalanced and SK's are wayyy too close to Warriors tanking wise. That's the Grrr part of it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dovan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">So you want his home address cause he made a comic, trying to portray the disparity of warriors in grouping situation, on a website that is not only view by 1/4+ of EQ subscribers, but is also linked to the Safehouse, where EQ PR is present often?<br />
<br />
Can we get this moved to the Outhouse?</div></div><hr />

I nominate Apothes</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Dvus Nme</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">lol dudes I wasn't serious about hurting him IRL =/ I didn't know that the creator of these comics was a Warrior either... and can you all please not generalise Sullon Zek? The Sullon Zek message board is occupied entirely by people who quit EQ and are sour against EQ players, and they do not represent the Sullon Zek community. The people who actually play on Sullon don't waste their time posting about blacks and suicide. I'm not here to &quot;jihad&quot; like they do, I'm here because I'm a Warrior and I like teh infoz.</div></div><hr />

Iono what comic you were linking, direct linking to images is teh no-no.  But I saw this one (http://www.gucomics.com/archives/view.php?cdate=20031107) while looking for it, and once again Woody has made me larf.<br />
<br />
So, indirectly, thanks.<br />
<br />
EDIT::Figgered it out (http://www.gucomics.com/archives/view.php?cdate=20031107) I think.  The coffee comic is a work of genius, IMO.  One of my all time favourite gags :D.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">would have been funnier if woody himself would have came here and told ya about not remote linking his pic's  :D</div></div><hr />

In case you have not noticed, they were generalizing Sullon Zek because of YOU and not because of some Board Jihads.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Dvus Nme</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Err... yes, that would have been very funny...<br />
And people wonder why Sullon Zek has a bad rep....<br />
No, he was generalising Sullon Zek, putting me in the same category as the previous SZers he's experienced. You fucking dicks think I'm trying to put town your buddy Woody or whatever, or trying to start shit? I was merely pointing out this comic because it outlines a fact that gets on all of our nerves at some stage. Take it how you want, I don't give a fuck if you guys want to pull the piss out of me to strengthen your imaginary cyber-reputation. I'm not here for a &quot;flame war&quot; (I think that's what bluebies call it). I'm here to discuss and stay on top of issues concerning my class. Ok? And for the person with 25087235082735083275 posts that replies to this post trying to rebutt/mock me, I just don't give a fuck what you say :) and I probably wont be looking at this thread again, so guys feel free to massage eachother's cyber-cocks at the cost of my reputation, while I read threads worth caring about. Oh, and in case you all forgot you're humans, how about excercising that quality attribute we all possess called 'sense of humour' it'll do y'all a bit of good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>NinjaBurger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Holy fucking thread rez, batman!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">(I think that's what bluebies call it). <br />
<br />
that's what it 90% of the internet calls it, get on more! How do SZ elitists call it? Thread Jihad? You claim not to be one of these idiots, yet you cant even post 5 lines without it clearly showing. <br />
Hold still while I urinate all over you? =P<br />
<br />
Sense of Humor? who actually did not understand the gucomic in the first place ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Dvus Nme</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I understood the comic bro... lol, what I didn't know was that the creatore of the comic is a Warrior which made my post seem like I was actually pissed off. If you don't understand by now I'm not gonna try explain it to you again, it's too hard trying to get through your attention-loving, inflated head.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Trondir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">ok, so you call people &quot;scum&quot; for no reason?<br />
I am glad SZ exists, otherwise people like you might be playing on MY server.</div></div><hr />
