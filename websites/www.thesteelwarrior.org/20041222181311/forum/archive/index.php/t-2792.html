I have never played a warrior<br />
I do not know enough about the warrior class to truly understand how something like this would affect the class<br />
<br />
I had an idea and wanted feedback from the other pure melee classes. It could be nothing more than a pipe dream or it might have some merit, you decide  :)<br />

That's a bit rude Burger. Here's a nice helpful monk trying to reach out to his melee brothers and sisters. Maybe you could have directed him to our class balance board instead?</div></div><hr />

Are whole equipment was designed around not having any....<br />
and if you make it become beneficial, then all melee loot will suck.<br />
Including Raex, Bedil(sp?) etc... <br />
<br />
Forgot mana, you'll never touch it. You're devoted to force, not mental.<br />
Make a whole new bar that could &quot;act&quot; as a mana bar if you wish. And it could be affected by new focus or new sorts of regen... and make stamina/agi/dex have effects on it's size...<br />
but don't ever touch mana. ;)<br />
<br />
You can check out the idea I posted a bit lower, called Juice and Disciplines. I think it's in your line of thoughts.</div></div><hr />

Would you like to explain why Warriors need Charisma for DI to fire then?  I currently have 40 Charisma and there is almost NO top end gear that has good Charisma.  I might be able to get a max +70ish Charisma from just worse than top end gear, but that is still far far from the ideal point of 280+ Charisma.<br />
<br />
If you don't know the DI info... it goes sort of like this:<br />
<br />
50 CHA = ~30% chance for DI to fire<br />
120 CHA = ~50% chance for DI to fire<br />
200 CHA = ~70% chance for DI to fire<br />
280+ CHA = ~96% chance for DI to fire<br />
<br />
These tests were run by EQClerics, fairly extensively.  If you want the link I can provide it.<br />
<br />
Edit: I should point out that these CHA values are for the WARRIOR, not the cleric casting the spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bunnie Burner</div><div class="date">08-31-2003, 08:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Because DI isn't a warrior specific spell... it's not even a melee specific spell..<br />
It's a spell for everyone, and if you have enough charisma, the gods will like you more and maybe let you live.<br />
<br />
And if a warrior had maxxed cha easily.... then he wouldn't die much, now would he?<br />
<br />
This is about mana/int having a direct influence on a warrior's capabilities...<br />
if you want SOE to put mana and int on every single equipment out there, and tuning down our hp on equipment to compensate...<br />
go ahead,<br />
then good luck.</div></div><hr />
