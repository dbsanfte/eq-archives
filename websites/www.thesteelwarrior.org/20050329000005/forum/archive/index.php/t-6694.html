Also I believe this is the begining of the forced migration that will make the majority of their customers goto eq2. Well in theory anyways, I, personally, will not be buying another SoE product ever.</div></div><hr />

It's this kind of sloppy crap that really pisses me off.  The really sorry thing about it is these are new problems added to a game that has been working fine for years.</div></div><hr />

I was able to corner some mobs while others were a no go - might have something to do with the corner not being entirely square tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">scrab1</div><div class="date">04-14-2004, 06:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cornered glyphed, exiled, cursed, and emp no problem.  Cornered the snakes at C3 as well.  Theres lots of hopping around going on when you look at it from another players perspective, but seems to work.-</div></div><hr />

we had problems for a few days and then it's back to normal pretty much only one incident i can remember</div></div><hr />

Haven't been on since 14/04/04 patch, but imagine the no more rewind bit will fix the things that made it difficult for me.</div></div><hr />

CT still has some problems but they are much easier to work around</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think they removed rewind completely with yesterdays patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ernie</div><div class="date">04-15-2004, 10:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Woot!!! Congrats on the BoW Cyprex!!!<br />
<br />
As for cornering, I didn't MA except a little bit last night to let one of our other guys take a break but things seem improved after the patch.  I'm  a gnome and was able to park snakes just fine in Ssra in a convienient corner.<br />
<br />
VT cornering seemed to work out fine!!<br />
<br />
yay!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gasmaster</div><div class="date">04-15-2004, 10:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Has anyone had any problems ducking since the patch? It seems when I duck near a crowded aread or near a wall I get stuck and can't move or stand back up by pressing D. I talked to a friend that's having the same problem, were both ogre's so I'm curious if anyone else has experienced this. The only way to get unstuck is either by sitting down or jumping.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
I've had issues with AoW/Idol/Status warping even before the DX9 patch. Three times in a row we had AoW warp on us at under 10%, same with Idol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lens314</div><div class="date">04-15-2004, 12:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">He didnt warp for us, I just couldnt get him and me into the corner correctly. :/</div></div><hr />

<br />
Got a few complaints of that from some guildies last night.<br />
<br />
As for cornering, Avatar of Smoke cornered just fine last night. I was skelly and double shrunk for it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abynormal777</div><div class="date">04-16-2004, 07:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I didn't have good luck with Nadox Inny last night.  We had a mixup and he went to the healer corner after punting me into my corner behind the boxes (I was in the corner on the left in his room...healers in the hall just around the corner.)  I couldn't get out from behind the boxes no matter what I tried - which has never been a problem in the past (shrunk x2).  Then, after Inny killed 2 of 3 clerics he started hitting me through the walls (I was 2 boxing a shaman and I could clearly see him on my shaman's screen in the healer area...but I couldn't see him on my warrior screen even though I was getting hit.)<br />
<br />
Overall, it seems better (in other zones), but some encounters still seem screwed.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bigchest</div><div class="date">04-16-2004, 09:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i got stuck ducking on two things in tranq last night, huge pain.<br />
<br />
and i cant remember if ive ever cornered AoW, think maybe once but i know at least 3 times i havent been able to corner him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anakun</div><div class="date">04-16-2004, 10:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I played last night logged on my mage to farm some and if I stood in a door way and the door shut then I would get stuck inside the door. happened in PoK at the big bank and in dulak harbor at the ocean crasher house, but when I loaded up my war and went to tank in bot I was able to corner very easily tho its not raid level cornering makes exping with rogues and monks easier.</div></div><hr />

<br />
However, not only were we able to corner mobs in PoFire post-patch, the SA (me) and TA (also barb) were able to corner as double shrunk barbs instead of relying on illusions. Our MA (an ogre) used gnome so I'm not sure that double shrunk ogre would work or not.</div></div><hr />
