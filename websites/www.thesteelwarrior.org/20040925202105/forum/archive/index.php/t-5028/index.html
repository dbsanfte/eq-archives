My FPS skills have atrophied though. Last time I got on UT, it was just sad. I'm all about instagib team deathmatch. Running around blowing people to smithereens (sp?) is a wonderful contrast to the humdrum of EQ. (err at least it is when I CAN'T get on EQ heh)</div></div><hr />

Fuck yea!<br />
<br />
I pwned with Spinal!<br />
<br />
I would always get like 13-15 hit combo on my friends because they tried to play it like Street Fighter II ^^</div></div><hr />

I used Saberwulf...there was just something about knocking someone with a huge combo with the last shot sending them airborne, then howling as they fly through the air and crash down in a twisted heap ;) style~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Wompem Ondahed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I'm playing PlanetSide, thanks to the 30 day free trial going on right now. PS makes EQ look well programmed and efficient. My system cries mommy after a couple hours due to lag/memory leak. The maturity level of PS makes the Zek servers appear tame. People gloat more than I have ever seen.<br />
<br />
It is a fun game though, similar to any FPS game. I enjoy sniping from hills, or jumping in a wall turret because they have heavy armor and endless ammo. Fun stuff. I will have to upgrade my vid card and add another stick of 512 if I decide to keep playing, though. =/</div></div><hr />

I just went back through Xenogears again, and it still has one of the best RPG plots ever.  I've also been tooling around with Final Fantasy Tactics again.<br />
<br />
I dusted off my Sega Saturn and started playing Dragon Force, Panzer Dragoon Saga, Darius Gaiden (love 2D shooters) and a few of the Capcom 2D fighters like Marvel Super Heroes, Darkstalkers 2 and X-Men:  Children of the Atom.<br />
<br />
Also, I bought my wife Midway Arcade Treasures for the GameCube for Christmas.  Smash TV is still &quot;teh win.&quot;<br />

Not too hard once you got down the fireballs and basic combos. Especially easy if you use weak attacks to start the chain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Call of Duty rocks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
btw, if any of you happen to have quake 3 and want to get totally messed up by yours truly, try www.urbanterror.net its a free mod and its swat based, also has free punkbuster to keep the OGC, walls hackers and all that other crap out<br />

<br />
I'm shaft, if you start playing  :D  I'ma have to take a look at that ... I tried it once, one of the early versions, and was hopeless.  It looks like they've really got the mod singing now, tho.  I first tripped over reference to the Thievery mod on a System Shock forum iirc.  You may get a kick out of http://www.planetunreal.com/UCZ/ - another good re-invention of UT that has kept quietly improving while I was looking the other way.<br />

I started playing somewhere around version 0.80, &amp; finished around 1.20.  I tried it again a while ago, but the gameplay was even flatter than I had remembered it :p.</div></div><hr />
