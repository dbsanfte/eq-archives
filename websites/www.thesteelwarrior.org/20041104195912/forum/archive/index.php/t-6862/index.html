<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mistikat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My Magelo: Mistikat's Magelo (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=318325) <br />
<br />
I tank all day in BoThunder with no problems, Weapon Affinity helped my spotty BoC procs alot, so I have little to no aggro problems finally. <br />
<br />
I need some advice: I am not a main tank in my guild, in fact I'm an alt. Which means I get zero consideration for upgraded gear options, unless I can get them with one group somewhere on my own. Take a hard look at my current gear and AA's, and please let me know what to do now. Grinding AA's in BoT is fun, but it's becoming... trivial. I don't like LDoN, except for the Anger Augs im trying to get enough points for in EF, and the legs and bracers out of NRo.  I am flagged for tactics, HoH, Etc. No Sol Ro or EP yet. <br />
<br />
Suggestions on where to go from here?  I have a blast playin my warrior, and he is finally becoming a force to reckon with. But the gear upgrades are becoming sparse.  Thanks in advance for assistance with this problem, and also any suggestions on AA Progression.</div></div><hr />

<br />
your gear is some of the strongest buyable gear ... just make up for what you lack with aa's ... with lots of hp aas and avoidance aa's you will go far.  max hp aas would put you over 6k unbuffed easily.<br />
<br />
may want to look at icestorm in BoT (tower) for his Great Blade of Storms for offhand ... or, depending on how strong a group of your friends is, vallon zek in tactics for his scimitar for offhand.<br />
<br />
not much else i can tell ya ... how &quot;progressed&quot; is your guild, and where is your guilds MT hps sitting at presently?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gaylon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You and I are pretty much in the same &quot;boat&quot;.  Gearwise you seem to be abit more &quot;solid&quot;.  What I am concentrating on now is AA's and a few LDON upgrades.  I think with the right augs some of the LDON gear can turn out very nicely for those of use w/o access to the ubah gear.  Definetely Anger 3 the BoC and my advice would be to Yak the Bloodsworn.  Great Blade of Storms would be a nice addition and since you are in a guild (i am not) you probably have a chance at that as well.  Also when you are bored grab a healer and go duo the Restless Souls in Natimbi and hopefully get a few of the +20 Type 7 Augs.  They are good for earings, etc.  But in general there is not much Bazaar gear for us left, i havent &quot;shopped&quot; in the Bazaar in quite a while which is both refreshing and frustrating. :)  Don't discount LDON stuff there are some very nice items that can be bought from LDON.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mistikat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeah, I thought about switching mains..... Not quite sure how that would go over tho. I certainly have more fun playing my warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ernie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Get your 100 aa under your belt.  Going from worse than your situation and wondering a lot of the same thoughts to having all my defensive aa done (well not all sturdiness but :P ) my tanking has improved by leaps and bounds.<br />
<br />
As for gear well, here are is a quick list:<br />
<br />
Heavy Rubi belt<br />
Another Steel Ring of Earthen Resilance<br />
Another ornate bracer, or a Mana Threaded Bone Bracer or a Crystalized Acid Bracer (probably in order from easiest to hardest, depending on your $$)<br />
Shoulders - Horn Spiked Shoulders from the Shade in PoN, or work on the Strength of Elements quest or maybe Crystalized Pauldrons<br />
<br />
And yeah, if you can lay hands on a GBoS or OSoW for your offhand, that would be great, as well as the anger aug suggestions....although I have a hard time dropping a lot of points into a tradeable weapon like a BoC.  Maybe land a GBoS and aug that for your mainhand and offhand the BoC?<br />
<br />
My BoC is a guild one so I can't aug it, so it makes the decision easy for me :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My BoC is a guild one so I can't aug it, so it makes the decision easy for me  <br />
<br />
  Not sure I understand... why can't you augment it? They ARE removable, it'll just cost you the extra points to augment something else later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rodney</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">From waht I can see something does not add up, how much of your gear did the guild provide?   I dont see how you would get what you have and not have a hell of a lot more AA's, look at Gaylon with 72.  I would be welling to bet your guild leaders want to see you WORK harder to make a better tank (AA's).    From your guilds MB &quot;what will benefit the guild most&quot; on who and why of loot.  Get your def AA's they will use you.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">My Ex-guild had the same policy about returning droppable loot if you left,booted, or it was upgraded.<br />
<br />
They had people aug'ing things then leaving or such and not returning them. This is the only problem I can see. But then again I am not a member of your guild and do not know the rules.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Slagfest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Get the hp AA's then the rest of the defensive..gear wise Ldon seems to be the best avenue untill u decide to switch mains or your guild decides to farm lower end stuff that would be an upgrade for ya.<br />
<br />
BoT does get boring but you need to work on your Aa's and that zone is easy access/grouping overall, and the loot aint bad for selling</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ernie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Not sure I understand... why can't you augment it? They ARE removable, it'll just cost you the extra points to augment something else later.<br />
<br />
Exactly as the other poster stated.  The guild rule is not to aug them so they remain tradeable and therefore no excuse to return it.  For example, if I pumped 1150 points into an Anger III aug for the BoC I have, if things went sour I might respond with &quot;Well I'm not removing the anger aug so I'm not giving the BoC back!&quot;<br />
<br />
But then I'm not that kinda person, so it's not a big deal :)<br />
<br />
I did put a 150 point Mir Ice DD in it (just for extra dps, I don't care if I have to remove it to give it to someone else).<br />
<br />
Overall, while I was really bummed that I didn't have the DKP for the Bloodfrenzy when it dropped, I did like it since I got that warrior's guild BoC (he offhands an anger III auged GBoS).   :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Mistikat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">None of my gear is guild provided. I worked hard with my main, a 65 magician, to be able to afford what you see on him. ( Many a sleepless night went by wondering why oh why I sold the ornate silk bracer pattern instead of puttin it on my mage, he's only got one, cuz I sold the other for BoC money, as well as a FT necklace and some other nice stuff I forewent due to my kitty ); It's rough running what amounts to two mains. I love them both so much, but... I am becoimg bored with the mage. I like being able to take a whoopin, thats why when I created him, back when SoL came out, his surname became &quot; Maintank &quot;. I always wanted a tank. So I spent the time farming, factioning, etc. to build myself a tank. And here he is. <br />
<br />
* Just wondering, how is the quest completed for Strength of the elements now that Yael isn't in the hole anymore? What drops the piece? I have the Phinny peice already, just dreaded tackling Yael, the Death-Touching machine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
One of the two gargs that guard the Guardian of the Seal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">but isnt a boc without aug worse than a chos with angerIII aug? it seems rather odd a guild saying you cant aug a weapon that is just screaming out for an anger aug. what i would probably do in this situation is ask the GL how much money the guild would ask for me to simply buy it straight up from them and see if i could get a significant discount from the market price (200k instead of 400k maybe). then again if you cant get 200k then that wont work either. looks like the warrior is gradually becoming your main but with only 20 aa i can also see why your guild isnt letting you MT if they have an alternative. the change will come in time.<br />
<br />
my warrior has only 29 aa at this writing and so gets overlooked for MT in guild raids but he is almost always MT in ldon. maybe this is one reason i like ldon :)</div></div><hr />

Grinding AA's im up to 46 now. Question in my mind now is, Innate Defense or Lightning Reflexes first?  I trained up to CA3, and I notice I take MUCH less damage when tanking now. Only have CS1, but is there a huge defensive boost to it or is it something that just ' should ' be trained out ? Either of more importance ? I know, I know, ND3 needs to be on my AA map in the near future as well.  :)   <br />
<br />
Comments and suggestions most appreciated. Thanks !</div></div><hr />

I'd do ND3 then finish CS3, then do LR5 then ID5</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Arathena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">For the 12 AAs that CS3 costs, you get the just about twice the damage reduction that sinking 15 AA into LR5 will get you. The choice is yours. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Otheuym</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Personally I say finish the base AA before moving to the POP ones. Loooking at your profile I would say:<br />
<br />
Finish ND3<br />
Finish CS3<br />
get PE<br />
finish PP<br />
LR5<br />
ID5<br />
<br />
Then start getting<br />
Sturdiness and WA depending on how your agro holding is<br />

As for gear most everything I got is one groupable or buyable. I got lucky and won the roll on my CHSD a while back from my guild and I did the Ring of the Dain quest so I had my guild help me with that raid. Other than that everything else can either be bought or gotten with a single group. I did get my piece from the hole while on a raid BUT I have personally seen one of the gargs split away from the Guardian by a monk. It took a while and several deaths by the monk but he did do it finally it just did not drop it that time so a good monk should be able to split one away. I think the one on the side of the Guardian closest to the wall is impossible to split off since he has to be pulled to the other side of the guardian. But most monks I know like a challenge.<br />
<br />
I know you said you do not like LDON but honestly hard LDONS have some great loot that is single groupable so I would seriously think about trying Hard LDONs.</div></div><hr />
