<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>golemn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">People always say, &quot;First get to level 65, then work on your AAs&quot;.<br />
<br />
Now, I imagine they say this because levels help a lot more than AAs. But, isn't it easier to gain AAs at level 51 when you can easily kill loads of blues with a level 65 PLing you than when you're level 65 (Well, if you're elemental flagged AAs at 65 are pretty fast too, but if you're not it takes a while)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Neksnappa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Regardless of whether you are leve 51 or 65, an AA still requires the same  amount if of exp. So if you're killing level 48 mobs at level 51, it will take much much longer to get an AA than if you were level 65, killing level 60+ mobs.<br />
<br />
lets say each aa takes 10,000 exp. killing a level 48 mob might get you around 50 exp points. Killing a level 62 mob on the other hand would  give about 500 exp. The moral of the story: Grind to 65, then do AAs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Qest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">How many people under 65 have you come across with more than 100 aa?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">How fast can you get an AA powerleveling yourself at 51?  If it takes more than 2 hours (and I am willing to bet that it does) then go to 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Anyone with PoP can get an AA in 1 hour, even with no flags at all. You can probably do even better than that with a good group in the right camp, I know CoD is good for an AA every 35-45min or so with a high DPS group. If you can do better than that at 51, then more power to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>lokkak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">A couple of points:<br />
<br />
1) Exp is based on the difference between your level (and the average<br />
group level) and the level of the mob.  If you are soloing and kill<br />
a mob at most 5 levels below your level, you gain around 90 percent<br />
(multiplied by 1.9) more exp.  If you kill mobs at most 5 levels<br />
above you, it is 190 percent (multiplied by 2.9) exp.  This was<br />
explained in a dev journal, but the numbers (1.9 to 2.9) come from<br />
observation.<br />
<br />
2) The BEST I could find (aa rate) at level 51 was killing most of<br />
the zone with AE'ing weapons in City of Mist.  DS, buff with a<br />
cleric and druid, get lev, project earth elemental form from enc,<br />
and argo as much of the zone as you can.  Use vie, and heal over<br />
time, with CH's.  This is not &quot;easy&quot;, but does produce an AA an<br />
hour grouped with one level 30 character (who got more than a level<br />
an hour until I stopped at level 43.)  Expect to die once or twice<br />
an hour (I did) and the deaths can be rather annoying.<br />
<br />
3) I experimented with AA rates for a long time.  Comparing AA rates<br />
against level 65 characters to determine that if you are MORE than<br />
5 levels below (or above) the average group level, you get no bonus<br />
(the 1.9 to 2.9 multiplier above.)  So, you need to be level 60 to<br />
gain the bonus when grouped with all level 65s.  Being level 60<br />
will give MORE exp to the level 65's (refer to Sony's Dev journal<br />
where group division of exp is explained.)<br />
<br />
4) A level 60 in a 65 group gains 25 percent more exp than a level<br />
65 in SolRo (all level 65 mobs.)  Level 61 is 30 percent more in<br />
SolRo.  This is measured over time by comparing the time between<br />
AA dings of the level 65's and the level 60/61s.  The majority of<br />
the time I grouped in SolRo, PoE/PoF/PoW.  PoV killing the level<br />
67 named for AG water was also nice EXP for level 61's.<br />
<br />
5) Now, that being said, most people level 60 or 61 are not worthy<br />
tanks.  Primarily because they do not have 100 AA (as was said<br />
before.)  If you compare a level 60 with CA3/CS3/PE/ND3 to a level<br />
65 with identical AA's, they will compare  favorably in tanking<br />
abilities.  The level 65 will have approx 200 to 500 more HP<br />
(depending on if the 65 has PP and PD AA's) and at low HP (below<br />
8k buffed) 500 hp makes a big difference in &quot;how often you die per<br />
hour.&quot;<br />
<br />
6) Also, if you ARE lower level than 65, you will experience severe<br />
level prejudice.  You will find it hard to find groups.  Your best<br />
bet it to START the group with a dual box Cleric, Enchanter, or<br />
Shaman (someone very important.)  I found that once people GROUPED<br />
with me they were more likely to ask me to join their groups in the<br />
future.   But in the end, I would still recommend leveling to 65<br />
unless you are severely behind in AA's from your friends (this was<br />
my primary reason for remaining lower, I need to catch up on some<br />
AA's.)<br />
<br />
In short, unless you like hardship, go level 65, then AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Frig Coldheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">What I have done is set my AA exp to 10% and left it. Buy the time I am 65 I will have about 10-15 AA's. This will give you a title and a start on the HP AA's. Unfortunatly you will be competing for groups with tanks that have over 100 AA's. There is really not a good answer to that but to keep trying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The bonus for fighting red is significant.  If your method of killing mobs do not primarily depend on what damage you can do, then you should try to be at a level where all the mobs are still red to you (like high 50s since most zones feature low 60s mobs).  It is not clear to me if beyond the +3 range whether you'd get further additional bonus to xp, beyond the fact that higher level mobs naturally give more XP to begin with.  Actually, the ideal place to PL would be at around level 55 in Plane of Storms so that the mobs will be red and you'll also have the highest ZEM out of all PoP zones (at least it used to be, since PoEarth is obviously out of your reach).  <br />
<br />
But if your method of gaining xp at all depends on grouping, you should try to get to 65.  Although it is possible to leech in a group as say a level 61 it's quite a bit harder to get in a group when you're level 61 than when you're level 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gnomos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well, I had about 120 aa before I levelled above 60.  It kind of depends on your resources and hunting habits which is better, AA or level first.  If you can get consistent groups in PoP, like with a guild, then I'd say level to 65 first.<br />
<br />
In my situation, I 2box a cleric, and the guild I was with at the time was mostly level 60, and just pushing into pop.  Groups there were very inconsistent, I'd go LFG for hours.  So instead I went to velks and 2boxed the ledge.  I'd make an AA there in 2 hours pretty consistently, and the loot I got helped a lot too.  But the big advantage was I could get busy XPing right away, while others were sitting around LFG.  So I farmed AA until I had all my pre-pop defense done, and 30 aa in the bank.  Then I went to bot for a couple nights and levelled up, took me 3 days to get to 65, and I bought most all my AA along the way, worked out pretty good.</div></div><hr />

Anyone with PoP can get an AA in 1 hour, even with no flags at all. You can probably do even better than that with a good group in the right camp, I know CoD is good for an AA every 35-45min or so with a high DPS group. If you can do better than that at 51, then more power to you. <br />
<br />
I believe CoD requires a flag or key at 51, doesn't it?<br />
<br />
I haven't XPed in CoD, so I can't speak to the xp there.  I have hunted most of the other tier 1 and 2 zones for loot, XP, and raids.  The only place I have seen where I can get 1 AA an hour is BoT bees, with a chanter in the group who charms a stormrider, and that requires a chanter who is at least level 63.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>lokkak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">CoD required caprin script IIRC.<br />
PoJ trial will get you Pos/Pov flag.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Launea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I think you said in another post that you are Sol Ro flagged Golumn. If so, get 65 now, then get AA's in Sol Ro. I easily get 2 AA an hour. Now, just for looking toward the future, and incentive to get 65, in Plane of Fire, at tables, I get 6% per kill in a full group, when I duo with my necro friend I get 8% per kill, and the duo kills only take about a minute and a half and they are constant. In PoF i get on average 3 to 4 AA an hour, depending on the group makeup.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">CoD requires Grummus kill pre-55. However, it would be a complete waste of time for a sub-55 to try to tank there. Unless you have a good PL crew or you have a group that doesn't mind you leeching exp, don't plan on tanking there that low.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Microxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">-----------------------------------------------<br />

-----------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
FYI,<br />
<br />
I did the same thing, set my AA to 10% once I hit lvl 51. <br />
<br />
I am now lvl 61, and ony have 1 AA so far. :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">simple turns: higher mobs mean more exp right?<br />
<br />
well if at 51 your killing red things then you get some darn good exp!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Plumppoopsie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I have done alot of AA's pre 65, to slow down my level gain (to stay in range of friends).<br />
<br />
Will say, hands down, gaining AA's in PoP at 65, is ALOT beter then at 53, 58 and 60.  Didn't do AA's from 60-64 so not sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>rysingsun1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">&lt;&lt;How many people under 65 have you come across with more than 100 aa?&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
my druid at 62 has about 170 .. then again people think im weird. then again even ill admit i could get aa faster at 65.<br />
<br />
my warrior is pushing for 65 before he gets anymore aa (about 12 now). his reasoning is his defense is good enough not to humiliate himself at 65 with the 12 he has so he will wait and then get aa more easily at that level.</div></div><hr />
