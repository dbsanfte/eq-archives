<br />
Self only buffs,  lvl 65 normal LDON - 27 collect in EC,  no deaths, done with 33 minutes to spare.<br />
<br />
Mixed levels of gear, 5 of us are pre-elemental.<br />
<br />
Just rotated tanking duty, had 3 ToD's, snare whips, and used healing will a lot. We only had to hold pulls twice for very short healing breaks  (about 30 second pause) after 3 pulls.<br />
<br />
It was the most fun I've had in a long time.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Haha, awesome! Too bad its so hard to find other wars equipped with snare whips and ToDs these days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>GorfinML</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">snare whip and ToD were the very first utility things i got....even anger auged the ToD for giggles<br />
<br />
it boggles the mind when wars dont even have a cheapo snare item...<br />
<br />
i woudlnt mind grabbing an anklesmasher from CD for double snare duty</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nissa XXX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Id love to do an all war LDoN.  Closest I have come is 5 melee and 1 shaman.  Our MT was a time geared SK with all Tap AAs.  he didnt need a single heal for 4 normal LDoNs heh sick...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I wish I could move my Shikarii over to Test...i had so many utility items for Kia to kill himself with err, i mean..solo..<br />
but that warrior army LDoN must have been a trip. too bad my PC krapped out and I couldn't finish this post :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Busstin1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Love my ToD its kinda like master card you never leave home without it  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kilzalot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've always wanted to take 5 Warriors and a Bard into a normal slaughter adv and just shakerpage it.. that would own.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Just do Guk or Mistmoore and you won't have to worry about runners (mostly).<br />
<br />
I wonder if 6 warriors with Fleshbiter can keep things stunned long enough to do a Hard?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gorgor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Nice job ! I would love to do an all war LDON as well :)<br />
<br />
But I think that lvl 70 will make this impossible ( or at least without Qvic+ gear ) because if your group is composed of 6  lvl 70, a normal LDON adv will be the same as hard adv lvl 65. ( mob hitting for 900+ and with more HPs)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Lathen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Grats, man! <br />
That sounds like a load of fun. I've done one with 5 melees and a Dru for healing, but your group is even more perfect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Alisdahre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Thing about doing a high risk with all warriors isn't so much the surviving a 900 hitter, but rather surviving two to five, sometimes even more, 900 hitters at once.  Warriors don't pull singles too good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Yoda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">the bonus with a full warrior LDoN mission is that you can have up to six MT and thus support more than single pull. limit would be closer to 'are you able to solo single pull LoDN ?'</div></div><hr />
