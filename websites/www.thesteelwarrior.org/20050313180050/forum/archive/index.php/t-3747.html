DBOTW/EOE stacks up better than i'd thought. Would be interested to see if the extra 53 atk and double riposte dps make much of a diff.  <br />
<br />
The difference would be negligible at best. The only place where a Vanazir would show any remotely significant parse over the DW combo is on mobs that have extremely low delays (1 second, sub 1 second) and quad/flurry/6 hit etc... and that would be on a war with maxed double riposte AAs. <br />
<br />
The extra 53 ATK would at best give him another 3-4 dps.<br />
<br />
Not to mention the DW combo puts out SIGNIFICANTLY greater aggro production. It basically leaves every other weapon combo in the dust by a mile and raises the bar for War aggro to a whole new level.</div></div><hr />

Or at least add the extra 2 or so AngerIII procs per min that would add.  And the 53 ATK would be 3-6 DPS or so.<br />
<br />
This also shows that you get about a 4/11 ratio on # of swings.  Which as shown in other parses would be around 30-40% more ripostes.<br />
<br />
I assume both were maxed Dex and Str.</div></div><hr />

Different mob, hence the realistic accuracy results. As I said it is a level 61 mob, assume average PoP mitigation. <br />
<br />
Basically, if you want unshakeable aggro, there is no susbstitute for the augmented DBoTW and EoE. It also keeps up a very respectable DPS as has been demonstrated.</div></div><hr />

This would also mean, in theor,y that the Players Damage Distribution would also be different between various expantions, hence the 11% difference. <br />
<br />
as for damage, with a BoW and eqwatcher, im told i very with my dps around 120-180 most of the time. when I go to EarthB and kill the zone in mobs I pull off 200+ most of the time, weather im infront or behind the mob. so type of mob also plays a part</div></div><hr />

DPS Differential between a Paladin and a Warrior using a Vanazir, 9.53. Note that this is without the paladin using his self-imbue proc which is a free proc/dps. Also to note is that this isn't a 30 minute parse or a 2 hour parse or something pidly. The sample size is large. So a paladin using their end game weapon versus a warrior using their end game 2hander is pulling in 91% of a warriors damage. You'll excuse me while I vomit. <br />
<br />
This thread should be enough proof that they fucked up itemization for Warriors in time and we are DUE a good 2hander.<br />
<br />
If any paladins care to step up and measure their internet penis with mine, feel free. I'll smack you the fuck down from whence you came with relative ease.<br />
<br />
Yea, we have triple attack and flurries. Monks take note to exactly how much that apparently does for warriors so you can shut the fuck up too. Not to mention I already have your parse in the works with a capped monk using an SoT. The bad news is coming, and it shows what we've always known, Warriors are getting the shaft.</div></div><hr />

I don't like using macro programs for actual gameplay, found it was more in the way than anything, but its good for skilling so you don't kill your hands.  I did this while I was working Archery and Throwing so as to not kill my fingers.  Used Xylobot.</div></div><hr />

I think you can perfectly well compare them.  Notice the fact we don't get a better 2-handers from phase 5.<br />
<br />
Also, maybe for you psychics it was obvious but the fact that the Dark Blade/Edge combo seem to be doing more dmg then Vanazir is news to me.<br />
<br />
An augmented vanazir is still probably the best atm, but that's until you can augment the Dark Blade, etc.<br />

<br />
2x1H provide ZERO hp over 1x2H combo<br />
(See Spalktar's parse on DPS taken with dual wield vs 2H)<br />
<br />
3 Times as much procs is false.<br />
Its at best 75-100% more procs fully augmented with Effects too.<br />
(Going from 1 EB/Stun per 10 seconds to 1 EB/Stun per 5/6 seconds is overkill)<br />
<br />
There is no DPS gap. The Virtual DPS gap is because you are comparing Tier 4 vs Tier5+Tier4.<br />
Which of course means the 2nd combo will be superior in DPS.<br />
(Well at least they got that part right)<br />
<br />
DBoW+EoE is indeed godly agro.  That however shouldnt make us forget<br />
that our Tier5 weapon should had been a 50/30 with a tweaked<br />
proc rate, and not some gay slow 1H.</div></div><hr />

GoC is tier 5 afaik, DBotW is tier 5 , EoE is tier 4 what are you talking about ? Maybe you could complain about the lack of tier 5 offhand for war. Point is to compare top equipement for both side.<br />
And that's not comparing DBotW + Hammer of the timeweaver that would further increase dps, stats &amp; reduce riposte.<br />
<br />
You are saying that riposte are the killer on the one hand, then complain DBotW is too slow, make up your mind please. Why would we care about delay ? <br />
<br />
As for proc, DBotW + EoE is about 7 ppm, Vana / Bow are 2ppm + about 1 with anger that would still be 130% upgrade on proc.<br />
<br />
Why should top end warrior weapon be 2handers when it had been 1 hander since day 1 ? Dual wield is supposed to be an edge over knight.</div></div><hr />

GBoC isnt overpowered compared to SoT, its the DBoW that sucks.<br />
<br />
A 35 delay weapon isnt a 1Hander. Its some weird thing.<br />
Doesnt have the benefits of 2H weapons (low ripostes spikes)<br />
And most of the Drawbacks of 1H weapons (offhander needed/extra DPS taken)<br />
The real advantage is its tweaked proc rate.<br />
<br />
Raaj 4.5 PPM : BoW + Anger + Combat 15<br />
Torrin 2.00 PPM : BoW<br />
Brutall 2.20 PPM : BoW + Combat 10<br />
Brutall 2.40 PPM : BoW + Combat 25<br />
http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=2638<br />
<br />
With CE30 it will probably be +100% proc rate.<br />
<br />
Using Quarm hammer removes totally 1 proc type from the equation<br />
(i dont believe a pet generates noticable agro)<br />
<br />
Dual wield died the day people realised AoW was tankable with a 2hander.<br />
Just to avoid that extra killer 1K hit. 1k-3k PoP ripostes just made things worse.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Granted, but we are a pure melee class, which should mean our DPS should be significantly higher then a knight or another hybrid minus maybe rangers bow damage.  Pure dual wielding or 2 handers warriors should only be below monks and rogues in terms of DPS, there is no reason at all for us to be lower consistently then knights and other hybrids when our main functions are damage intake and outake, there is nothing else we do besides this.  Hybrids on the other hand heal and buff and etc. etc. as you well know, this is NOT to say their dps should be shit, but it should be shouldnt be in the same range as warriors as it is now, if not higher in some cases.</div></div><hr />

Excuse me for pointing out the insanely obvious. GoC is a 1 mob drop. DBOTW is a 1 mob drop. EoE is a 1 mob drop. DBoTW + EoE = 2 mobs. Vanazir is our only 2hander in Time. I have every justification in the world to compare them - and let me also point something else out, no way, no how should you be coming this close to a War. People are forgetting that you can add another 8 DPS with Pious Might which puts the paly right at the balls of the Warrior - and you don't have to pay 1150 AP for that spell, now do you? If the GoC was broken up into two parts, one from P4 and one from P5 and required you to quest to make it a viable weapon, I wouldn't be complaining. Right now Paladins and Shadowknights live on a fucking resort.<br />
<br />
While the combo is higher DPS (face facts, it is - look in the mirror and shake your head and say 'no no no no no' all you want, it won't change facts) and more aggro, using it on spike-prone mobs will get you killed faster on average than using a 2hander, specifically a Vanazir. That's not guessing, that's a proven fact.</div></div><hr />

I have no fear.<br />
<br />
Though, I imagine that Denron probably has some +accuracy items.  It would be nice if you would take them off for the parse or at least make note of them.<br />
<br />
I don't think FK damage is necessary for the parse, but if you were wondering I have never parsed over 20dps from kicks.  Usually it is from 12-16 dps.  Oh, and just like a warrior, our top dps is using Shinai not a SoTran.  About 7% more dps or so.</div></div><hr />

While I agree that dual weilding will obviously cause more riposte damage than using a 2h, it also has the potential to significantly shorten the length of your fight (due to added MT hate), thus decreasing your chance at hitting a damage spike.  It also provides more HP and AC than 2h, which further lessens your chance at a spike round (during a round with a riposte and also without).  The benefits of using a 2h weapon simply to remove spike/riposte damage are definately there, but to only consider that and not the other benefits of dual weilding would be somewhat shortsited IMHO.</div></div><hr />

Granted, but we are a pure melee class, which should mean our DPS should be significantly higher then a knight or another hybrid minus maybe rangers bow damage.  Pure dual wielding or 2 handers warriors should only be below monks and rogues in terms of DPS, there is no reason at all for us to be lower consistently then knights and other hybrids when our main functions are damage intake and outake, there is nothing else we do besides this.  Hybrids on the other hand heal and buff and etc. etc. as you well know, this is NOT to say their dps should be shit, but it should be shouldnt be in the same range as warriors as it is now, if not higher in some cases.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Sidetracking a bit, and I agree with your stance regarding the DPS differences between knights and warriors, but as a ranger, our bow DPS at the upper levels of equipement is roughly equivilent to our melee DPS (non-trueshot).  Its obviously out of whack if you compare the melee DPS of a NTOV level ranger using an Elemental bow, but not when you compare Time level weapons with Bow of the Tempest.<br />
<br />
So claiming that rangers should have lower melee DPS than warriors is off base.  We don't compete with warriors or knights for the &quot;tank&quot; role.  We do however compete with Rogue and Monks (as well as casters) for the DPS positions, and to suggest a DPS class should have a lower DPS than a &quot;Tank&quot; class is a bit absurd.  We do have buffs and heals, but those should be counter-weighted to the DPS differences between us and our counterparts (rogues/monks) who have about as much of a comparison to your tanking as we do, and more non-raid &quot;utility&quot; than a warrior as well.</div></div><hr />

This parse is a TINY bit on the light side for DPS.

Yes, the mob is rooted. No, I have no idea why this proc pushes a rooted mob. It didn't happen often enough to become an issue (about once per hour), but I did want to note that it did happen.<br />

He's using EofE/Ranger sword from time and Bow of the tempest.  He said he used bow most of the time.<br />
<br />
With less total up time then me he still came up at a reasonable dmg range over me, which seem fine considering he got the best weapons and I'm not (using a Bow).  I'm not a maxed warrior too.  Even not counting his spell dmg, he was still a good notch in dps over me.  Lower then a rogue or SoT monk it seemed thought. <br />
<br />
Ranger spell dmg should be the most obvious difference between a ranger and warrior, like it's mostly been pre super bows boost.  I would be perfectly fine being in range of 5% of a ranger dps not counting spells.<br />
<br />
Btw, to be able to clearly compare a ranger versus a monk/warrior dps, you really need to add in spell.  Maybe someone could post what kind of spell dps a ranger can sustain with standards buffs, uber focus, etc?<br />

I've already told you what I suggest. Warriors need a 2hander from Phase 5.<br />

Paladin damage is also too high. Cutting the proc damage from Tendrils of Fire down from 250 to 100 would be a step in the right direction also.</div></div><hr />

Monk attack caps at 1567. Count the DPS lost from the 30 ATK and a few of the missed swings and you can add another solid 4 DPS to the parse. <br />

I'll be trying to get my hands on a monk with a Shinai and Wraps to run a more accurate DW vs DW parse. Parsing an equivalent (in terms of what is available in Time) 2hander versus 2hander and the warrior parses LOW and the Paladin too high.<br />

Kick damage for a warrior accounts for 1 DPS, on a good day.<br />

I don't know, I think you have enough data to work around it.  But it is hard to do a straight comparison without modifying it some.  He already doesn't have attack capped.  And well... I really believe that haste rounds delay UP (this is characteristic of all integers in computers.  They are always rounded up.  Of course it could be they are stored at 10 times the normal value to avoid this).  This means that 40% haste would take a 30 delay weapon to 22 delay or 36.4% haste.  And a 40% haste would take a 38 delay weapon to 28 delay or 35.7% haste.<br />
<br />
So really, the test would ideally be done with no haste.  BUT you have TONS of good data.  Just put it all up into a table and normalize it using known values (ie haste values) to come up with a number that can be directly compared.<br />
<br />
Or if you really want, just redo Den with a lower haste.  =P</div></div><hr />

I seem to be averaging about 200-205 DPS with Bow of the Tempest with full haste (no bard over haste), Eagle Eye, +15 accuracy for what thats worth, and 1800-1850 attack.  Another ranger in the guild is reporting about the same (195-200 DPS) under the same conditions.<br />
<br />
I'm not surprised though... Ive been saying for some time now bows are overrated at the high end when compared to Warrior/Monk/Rogue/Knight DPS with melee and Time level weapons (even elemental level weapons).</div></div><hr />

It sucks ass.  They need triple attack.  What happened to rangers is that elemental bows made their ways into the hands of NToV level rangers or lower, and you had all the lowbie rogues and monks crying NERF.  So rangers have this hugely overblown reputation of being massive DPS machines.  They are massive DPS machines for trueshot and that is it.  At all other points they are lacking.<br />

What is worse is that DoD isn't all that great of a weapon.  He would probably get another 5-10dps with Quarm hammer or EoE.<br />

I'm perfectly fine if their melee is a notch lower then warrior even, as long as their spell dps is good enough to get their head out of the sand so to speak.<br />
<br />
So how much added dps can a ranger do when meleeing, with their spells?  1 good estimate with no buff, 1 with c5 only and 1 with normal raid buffs (+9 and bst buff, bard, etc) would be cool to have a real idea where rangers are.  Would also be nice to extrapolate what the full haste dps would be, maybe in the other thread thought.<br />

Well, it is kinda hard to say that.  Monk is using 46% haste, but is down 25 atk or so and doesn't have the top one handed weapon which should be more damage.   <br />
<br />
My guess is monk with full attk, 41% haste, shinai will do 20% more damage than a warrior with DBotW/EoE and using kick.</div></div><hr />

Not really. You just make our argument more compelling. You may have missed the memo, but as a class Warriors don't have the option to cast any spells. When we're in a group with 5 other people, we don't stop to cast because we cannot stop to cast. Should we be given the option, we'd take it, of this I assure you... You stopping to cast isn't a detrement to your class, as you would probably like others to think, it's a benefit - one that we don't have the luxury of having as Warriors. <br />
<br />
Point is simple, you're never obligated to cast. You can choose to go full bore DPS and come within 90% of a Warriors DPS or you can tank within 95% of a warriors ability to tank, or hell, you could just cast spells. Poor you, you have it so bad :(</div></div><hr />

You could have someone with 90% of a Warriors DPS and 90% (96% or so if they give up all focus/ft/etc... but most smart ones don't do that) of a Warriors undisced tanking ability or you could have somebody with 100% of it.  He isn't saying that casting is a detriment to his class, obviously it's benefical thats why we do it, if it wasn't beneficial it would be just like it was in Kunark where Knights would hurt themselves by casting, but back to the point.  Your parse only shows his potential damage in an actual setting where the Paladin is hitting the mob's back he is tossing heals out as well which lowers melee damage further past a Warrior, remember each time a Paladin heals you unless its a group heal they have to switch their target and cast and then switch back, and in the case of group heals they must still stop meleeing to cast.  I will admit however that 90% is to much in one situation and that is when they can keep a mob stunned for 2/3 of its lifespan effecitvely reducing its dps to 0 and keep damage up during that time.<br />
<br />
I can't find the reply to quote it now, but someone said Warrior melee damage should be over Rangers as well.  I would have to say you're wrong on this, because a Rangers job is to do damage primarily with alittle bit of light tanking (mostly in the form of weaponshield... but I'm sure you've noticed they tank a fair bit in LDoN adventures if you do some for points since the mob melee is so weak even on hard setting atleast for time level people).  Im not sure if you've ever checked out a rangers spell lineup but it is definatley not geared for damage, at the high end they have two spells they dont lose damage by casting, both are horribly inefficent with long recasts, they're looking at maybe a 15 dps increase using spells which isn't much.</div></div><hr />

In the case of casting, heres a breakdown of melee lost from it for a Paladin assuming max mana regen (4 aotc, 18 voq, 8 sd, 18 bard song, 15 ft, 4 aa).<br />
<br />
Wave of Marr:  Chain casting - 9% Sustained casting - 3.9%<br />
QWoS: Chain casting - 7.7% Sustained casting - 7.7%<br />
Force of Alkalie:  Chain casting - 7.7% Sustained casting - 7.7%<br />
<br />
Mana regeneration is enough to sustain both QWoS and FoA forever provided the buffs remain up, using both stuns there is a penality of 15.4% in addition to the remainder of their mana which gets used on healing, another 15.4% loss from the 90 dps brings that damage to 76.5 dps, which is right where their melee damage is supposed to be in relation to a Warrior.  Don't take this as me saying their stun's arent overpowered because quite honestly they are atleast the damage mitigation from them is, I'm just saying their damage is in line with where it should be.<br />
<br />
Edit:  One thing I forgot to add to this.  Furor a few posts back you said that GoC needed it's proc nerfed, I have to disagree with this as well compare melee of it and Vanazir, Vanazir parses higher, the only reason GoC is more is due to its proc essentially making a phase 5 drop worse than a phase 4 drop if that were to happen which I'm sure you'll agree is not a good thing to do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Casting more than makes up for that ~14 dps loss. You being an SK makes that even more true than for a paladin. You can stack up ~58dps in dots without any focus, not to mention your pet and taps. Then you're putting out that 96dps while your dots work.</div></div><hr />

While your dps may be to low Knight damage should not be lowered further than it is, as I'm sure you realise the only thing that matters now for everyone other than the one person being hit (fixing that would fix alot) is how much damage they do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well that's very good!<br />
<br />
Cause once you don't have mana anymore you can do your 90% DPS of warrior only!  Choices are complicated, I'm sure they would prefer to be oom so they don't have to think about casting or meleeing.  Much simplier when you are oom right?<br />
<br />
And maybe they should up your melee dmg?  To over warriors so that when you chain cast spells in a group you still keep the 80% dmg to warrior ratio?  So let's say you do 100dps with your sword, you would lose 20 dps by chain casting wave of marr when it pop and the 2 stuns mentionned above?  That's the balance right? <br />
<br />
Joke aside, your logic is greatly flawed.  It's like you assume that the spells themselves do nothing but last time we checked, they were very usefull.<br />
<br />
And the 80/100/120/etc is not something we came up here to please us, it's something the dev said the last time they really did melee balancing.<br />

<br />
Your comparing actual warrior dps with potential paladin dps... while not apples to oranges, it is apples to applesauce.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, if defensive is really THAT needed, that you can't use any other disc, regardless of reset delay, then obviously a paladin without defensive has no chance in hell of filling your shoes.  The argument about taking more damage using aggressive is kinda weak too considering these parses are all done from the rear, not tanking.  In such a situation aggressive is an excellent disc to use. <br />
<br />
The point is that casting is by far and away a better choice than doing the dps.<br />
<br />
If that is really a true statement, why does it matter what our potential dps is?  So we can potentially do 85% of a warriors dps if we don't cast.  Your saying that casting is much more important therefore any lost dps is worth it.  So in reality we are doing something like 70-75% of a warriors dps or less.<br />
<br />
What standard do you want to use here?  Do you want to say that a paladin can tank nearly as good as a warrior ( I dont' agree with your 95% remark, but obviously I won't change your mind about your misguided perception of paladins) and cast heals, or do you want to say we can do close to your dps?  The reason I ask is because if we are doing one, we sure as hell can't do the other.<br />
<br />
Lets see some parses of paladin dps when they are tanking vs. a warrior dps when they are tanking.  Add in the downtime from mobs stunning the tanks, downtime from where paladins are casting and the added amount that discs can add (fell strike is about the best bet for tanking.... they really need to take the penalties off ya'lls two discs that give added precision). <br />
<br />
You can choose to go full bore DPS and come within 90% of a Warriors DPS or you can tank within 95% of a warriors ability to tank <br />
<br />
When you look at that statement, something sticks out to me.  Regardless of what we do, we are still behind warriors in abilities.  In both cases a warrior is still better then a paladin.  Why exactly are you so pissed off at paladins when you yourself state we are lesser then you?  <br />
<br />
I really want to type in some stuff to you furor about the way you look at paladins and how it seems you hate my class so much.  I really want to mention the fact that it looks alot like you can't stand to have another tank class actually compete with warriors for a tank slot.  While I do believe warriors and pure melee need some work, in know way do I believe warriors are as bad off as you try to portray.  Your rantings at paladins seem to make us into some super class that can do everything a warrior does and do it better, while you make statements that say warriors are in fact better then paladins.  <br />
<br />
I'm not gonna debate this with you though because I don't see anything I say changing your mind.  You'll just dismiss whatever I see as my being in a lesser part of the game then you and therefore I don't have a clue.  You seem pretty much devoted to making the warrior class appear weak and useless while at the same time building up paladins to unbelievable heights.  I have to really wonder what role you see paladins playing, because it appears our ability to tank, and as a part of that having the option to choose a paladin instead of a warrior for a group, is insanely threatening to you.  <br />
<br />
Regardless, your parses are nice and informative.  I just don't think you can take those parses and say paladins have too much dps solely from what you are looking at.  Your parses in no way reflect actual group or raid environments and therefore aren't applicable in an analyses of dps when applied to those situations.<br />
<br />
You have dps figures from a sterile environment and we don't play in a sterile environment.</div></div><hr />

Period. Ignore spells, potential, mana, all that stupid shit. There's no reason your melee should be that close to ours. Period. And if you're casting that much you should be damn lucky to do even 30-40% of our melee damage. Full bore straight melee only knight should be *MAX* 80% of a warrior with same/similar level gear(and probably should be less really). And it should go down from there considerably the more you cast. As it is you don't lose nearly enough melee casting those insane long 1-2 second cast time spells.<br />
<br />
 Frankly they should go back to spells costing you full melee rounds, not just delaying them. Losing .5 seconds of melee just isn't enough anymore. Stop acting like your spells cost you half your DPS, they don't and haven't for a long time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think that might have something to do with the whole Lay Hands, Harmtouch, Spellbook thing.<br />
<br />
here you are in two areas, and you're very close to your one of parent class's abilities in those areas.  Yet, you also have other areas where you are infinately better then that same parent class.<br />
<br />
do the math however you want.<br />
damage output + damage absorption + utility<br />
with a warrior as the base, 100 + 100 + 0 = 200<br />
Paladin 90 + 90 + 100 = 280<br />
SK 105 + 90 + 90 = 285<br />
defensive warrior 65 + 135 + 0 = 200<br />
agressive warrior 135 + 65 + 0 = 200<br />
<br />
I'm sure you get the idea, and this part of the debate really doesnt belong in this area.<br />
<br />
One other thing, every warrior at any raid is a potential tank every one of them saves for defensive, just in case things go very bad.  &quot;I blew agressive on this fight, I know all the other warriors are dead, but could you please try and keep the beastlord alive&quot;  just wouldnt cut it with some people.</div></div><hr />

In the case of casting, heres a breakdown of melee lost from it for a Paladin assuming max mana regen (4 aotc, 18 voq, 8 sd, 18 bard song, 15 ft, 4 aa).<br />
<br />
Wave of Marr:  Chain casting - 9% Sustained casting - 3.9%<br />
QWoS: Chain casting - 7.7% Sustained casting - 7.7%<br />
Force of Alkalie:  Chain casting - 7.7% Sustained casting - 7.7%<br />
<br />
Mana regeneration is enough to sustain both QWoS and FoA forever provided the buffs remain up, using both stuns there is a penality of 15.4% in addition to the remainder of their mana which gets used on healing, another 15.4% loss from the 90 dps brings that damage to 76.5 dps, which is right where their melee damage is supposed to be in relation to a Warrior.  Don't take this as me saying their stun's arent overpowered because quite honestly they are atleast the damage mitigation from them is, I'm just saying their damage is in line with where it should be.<br />
<br />
Edit:  One thing I forgot to add to this.  Furor a few posts back you said that GoC needed it's proc nerfed, I have to disagree with this as well compare melee of it and Vanazir, Vanazir parses higher, the only reason GoC is more is due to its proc essentially making a phase 5 drop worse than a phase 4 drop if that were to happen which I'm sure you'll agree is not a good thing to do.  <br />
<br />
I hate to add fuel to the fire in my own thread but this is just ASSININE. Vanazir parses HIGHER in DPS over GoC in WHAT WORLD? In a 35 minute parse some dude's uncle did on a server that you've heard about? Sorry, whatever person told you that the Vanazir parses HIGHER DPS than a GoC (in the hands of a Knight) is a complete and utter moron. I am shocked that Knights are so clueless about their own DPS. What do you guys look at? The big numbers and go 'oooooohhhh' and 'aaaaaaaaaaaah'? I'm at a loss for words. <br />
<br />
Secondly, lets just put the Paladin aside ok? Since you want to talk about the loss of DPS. <br />
<br />
You're a Shadowknight? What exactly do your spells do? Wait what? Did I hear you correctly? They ADD to your existing DPS? Correct, they increase your DPS in bursts. So as a Shadowknight that isn't healing his group or tossing an LoH or various other defensive spells, what are all the fancy spells you cast doing? That's RIGHT, adding to your DPS. You wouldn't cast them if they didnt increase your aggregate DPS would you? No, you wouldn't, what would be the point? Right, I'm waiting for the answer. I know what the point is, I just want to hear you say it...<br />
<br />
So please spare me the bullshit about who's drawing whos conclusions incorrectly. I play a simple class. I attack and I defend. I don't do anything else. I don't have myriad abilities and spells to fall back on. On any given raid that I run a Knight is tanking as much as any warrior and in LDoN raids, that number triples.<br />
<br />
Knight DPS is too high in comparison to the pure melee classes. Now either SoE can bump up the pure melee classes and leave Knight DPS where it is and pure melee are happy while Knights start their whine crusade again, or they nerf Knight DPS and Knights are pissed off. My money is they don't do either and you pompous assholes remain happy as pigs in shit for another 6 months.<br />
<br />
Sorry to go off on a rant but it needed to be said. It's hard to find a Knight that doesn't have their head so far up their ass that they're gasping for air.</div></div><hr />

guess i'll go out on a limb and say a knight useing best 1h and sheild v. war and best 1h and shield. the knight would leave the war in the dust in dps. would you be willing to prove/diprove this Furor? i know warriors like them for magelo not sure how many use them in combat.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When I remember right, there was  a change in the past ... long time ago ... that has as a result that hybrids do not stop attacking while casting a spell. So when this is right a knight can only loose damage while casting stuff on someone else than the mob.<br />
<br />
When I cast a group spell ( with my other chars ) I can normally do it without changing the target. ( maybe its not so for paladin groupheals ).<br />
<br />
So stunning and grouphealing or dotting and DDing of the knights schould not lower their dps except then when they target another player for this and that.</div></div><hr />

(regular hybrid players might know this better than I).<br />
51+ I believe the change was made that any 3 second or higher spell they'd cast slightly faster than thier parent class.<br />
Also, the casting doesn't interrupt the melee swing timer so you could cast between melee swings without losing anything (where others would have the timer reset after spell was cast), again something the parent classes do not get.<br />
<br />
I don't really have a problem with these casting advantages for them...was quite a nice thing to add, however, Hybrids are currently far from thier old position of 75% war, 25% caster</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mokor:  I don't know how long you have played EQ but there are many things with Knights now which are designed a specific way for a reason.  Let me give you an explaniation for the reason that superior ratio Knight weapons exist atleast for 1h weapons (would like to see War/Rng get a good time 2h really... should have a superior option to VDD).  Back in the days before Kunark when not even the Plane of Sky was conquered there were hundreds of 1h weapons out there for Knights, however very few of these were Knight only, as a result of this they were all tuned for dual weild (Ghoulsbane, Blade of Abgoration, and one other Paladin sword were the only non dual weild tuned weapons).  This had the same effect on us that forcing you to fight with one hand behind your back would have on you.  Kunark was the beginning of 3 long years of sheer hell for playing my class so it is rare you will find me saying something good about it (this next point, and hybrid cast timers are the only good things I'll say actually) but this problem was fixed then and superior ratio Knight 1h'ers were implemented in order to alleivate the double penality we suffered on them (low skill caps+dual weild tuned weapons), infact the problem was fixed so well that we were given 19/24 1h weapons from exp camps in Sebilis, of course we were also put on Knight only damage tables from 51-60 completly negating any benefit this was meant to bring us.  In Velious however we were put on the correct damage tables and given even better 1h weapons, infact dual weilders are just now getting access to weapons of this ratio.  From Yelinak there was a 21/19, from ST there were 20/20's, from NToV there were 28/26's with 288dd procs.  In Luclin there were none, but oh well... you can't have everything can you?  Right now you're probally trying to figure out my point so I will get to it.  A Warrior has not been able to compete with a Knights damage with a 1h/shield combo since Pre-Kunark, in the case of Paladins since level 25 and in the case of SK's since PoS.<br />
<br />
Kilaara:  That is incorrect.  The way hybrid swing timers originally worked is whenever casting a spell it would pause the swing timer for the duration of the casting.  If I had a delay of 40 and casted a spell 2 seconds after my swing ended when the swing finished I would still have 2 seconds to wait until I could melee again.  The way it works now is the swing timer still counts down while I cast and if my swing comes up while I am mid cast the swing immeaditly happens after I finish casting, I can still lose damage by delaying my swing but not as bad as before.  As you can obviously see weapon delay can have a huge impact for us, while you are only affected by delay when a mob has a damage shield or you're infront of it a Knight is affected by it at all times.  If I were to use a 24 delay weapon for with max haste it would be ~12 delay, once you factor in reaction time and lag it becomes very unlikely a Knight can cast anything over about .5 seconds without causing atleast some impact on their melee, and impossible to cast anything over 1.2 seconds without impacting melee.  As delay scales up a Knight can cast longer spells without impacting melee (this is the key reason why many Knights use 2h btw, aside from the superior dps over a 1h that is).  With the highest delay weapon currently aviable for a high end Knight (VDD) the majority of spells will still impact melee regardless of the individual players ability to time their casts.<br />
<br />
Dreweno:  The high level spells Rangers recieve for dps are Brushfire (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=3431&amp;source=Live), and Frozen Wind (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=3418&amp;source=Live), additionally they can use Exile Summoned (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=1529&amp;source=Live) on summoned mob's.  Due to the fact that Rangers dual weild and thus have low delays they lose melee damage on their nukes unfortunatley that handicaps their potential power.  Frozen Wind comes in at a 1.9 cast time with 20 delay weapons a Ranger effectively has a delay of 10 once hasted, costing two full melee rounds in many cases assuming you don't have a bard in the group (mainly because I'm to tired to do the math on being hasted further from Rizlonas/Muse) and that you have max SCF as well as a Wrath of Eci item you would be gaining an average of 25% to the nuke making it effectively 875 damage, but once you factor in your lost melee (95 using archery from Furor's parse or 100 from melee I would assume) the actual gain is only 685 or 694 damage depending on which numbers you would prefer to use, I'm going to use mine (not that the difference between them is very large) , now consider that they can do this once every 32 seconds (for 300 mana btw) thats a mere 21.5 dps upgrade.  Brushfire is even more pathetic damage for a higher level spell.  Anyways that just backs up my comments earlier that Rangers are hurting pretty bad right now considering the fact that they're a dps class but don't exactly fill that role now.  Btw, the casting reduction is 3% per level on detremintal spells only starting at 51 and up, it is 45% at 65.<br />

Done with the Knight vs War argument here now, good parsing thread I don't want to mess it up more than it already has been.  Sorry again mod's.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry to burst your bubble but this is incorrect. The VDD in the hands of a Knight will not outdamage the GoC in pure melee DPS. Whoever fed you that data is wrong. I'd love to see a parse showing me otherwise. A parse showing me otherwise isn't a 8300 hp unbuffed Arbaal in full PoTime+ gear beating on a Beta Test server level 65 test mob for 45 minutes either. Brael. Don't come in here spouting off bad information without backing it up with facts - something you seem to lack.<br />
<br />
Secondly, you didn't answer my question, you danced around it instead. I'll ask it again, what do your spells do? If you don't want to answer, I'll answer it for you. While we (warriors) can do nothing to augment our own DPS, you as a Shadowknight can do quite a lot to increase your own DPS. If I were to let one of my SKs at the test mob for 14 hours, assuming they remained consistent in casting their spells and maintaining mana levels, there is ZERO doubt in my mind that they would not just destroy my DPS as a warrior, they would more than likely be right up the ass of our friendly neighborhood uber monk. This isn't just burst DPS either - this would remain consistent over an indefinite amount of time. Now tell me exactly WHAT is it that you lose in that time - the answer is nothing.  The only options available to me to augment my DPS are via support classes, an option also open to you that ALSO happens to stack with your class. Meanwhile, I have to double augment my DW setup to even come in the proximity of Knight aggro. A setup that took me MONTHS to achieve because of the incredible rarity of the DBoTW and the requirement of adventuring for augments. To add insult to injury, while my setup is 40% more aggro than previous weaponry, I take damage spikes several times WORSE than tanks that are using a 2hander. In short, what I was originally asking for is not even close to being unreasonable - that is, a Warrior only 2hander in P5.<br />
<br />
Thirdly, the Vanazir isn't good enough for YOU but it's supposed to be just fine and dandy for Warriors? Help me out, I'm confused. My original statement was that Warriors were due a two hander in P5 to put them back on track versus Knights. After I finished these parses I realized that Knights are simply an abomination in Everquest - ironically, no longer a hybrid of anything but instead their own grossly imbalanced class. <br />
<br />
Lastly, if you will recall, you also have a very respectable 1handed option in Time. <br />
<br />
Now you're done.</div></div><hr />

In the context of the Warrior/Knight Balance debate, the fact that these parses indicate that Knights are capable of closely approaching or exceeding Warrior DPS is relevent.<br />

In the same way, Magelos for Warriors and Knights can be examined and we might report that Knights are capable of approaching or exceeding Warrior buffed HP's.<br />

GoC beats Vanazir at both of these, therefore will be higher melee DPS at all attack levels vs all targets.<br />

Paladins best possible DPS is 81% of a warrior's best possible DPS. Monks best possible DPS is 19% more than warrior's best possible DPS (would the DW combo for monks give better damage?). Rogues best possible DPS is 53% better than best possible warrior DPS. Ranger DPS is in the shitter compared to where it should be at 81% or the best warrior's DPS.<br />
<br />
80, 100, 120, 140 is what VI said was the target way back during velious. These parses are fairly close to that. Rogue damage is too high relative to the rest of the classes and ranger damage is too low relative to the rest of the classes. Rangers just seem to get royally shafted to me since their primary role is damage output.<br />
<br />
Warriors should probably have a slightly better 2 hander at the top end, but the argument can be made that dual wield is the offensive and aggro generating setup and 2 handers have the benefit of lowering riposte damage. Kind of a judgement call on that. <br />
<br />
Does dual wield damage for warriors scale appropriately with with difficulty of drops? My understanding is that 2 handers are usually better DPS for all but the absolute very best equipped warriors. I would think that would be a point of contention. Someone correct me if I'm wrong.<br />
<br />
BTW, the hybrid inherent spell haste only works on detrimental spells. It doesn't affect heals at all and it doesn't affect any spell with a cast time below 3 seconds. As a paladin, the only 2 spells affected by the hybrid inherent spell haste are expel undead (level 54 273 hp undead nuke with 4.3 cast time) and dismiss undead (level 49 162 undead nuke with 3.3 cast time).<br />

<br />
This is a result of my opinion that ranged damage is less risky than melee DPS. Yes AE's sort of ruin this, but If I had the option to do 80% of my DPS that I do in melee from Range (Even 100) I'd do it in a heart beat. The AE's aren't what kills me the Ripostes from the mob spinning do.  So pending the melee parse of a ranger I'm not unsurprised by ranger ranged DPS. <br />
<br />
If their melee DPS is also this bad then they need something. If it's about where Eagle eye puts them (20%) higher or 10% better than a warrior I think they are fine. <br />

When melee is done from the rear or sides this is correct.  When taken from a tanking perspective the clarity of the melee DPS differential of these weapons diminish.<br />
<br />
Using the GBoC knight figures for accuracy and average hit factor (avg hit - weapon DB) you can calculate the rip DPS differential.  In this case it is 24.15 damage per rip between the weapons.  If tanking a mob that quads every 2s with a pc rip rate of 4.0% and a double rip chance of 80% (I dont have FoS and am assuming it stacks additively to luclin double rip AAs, correct me if this is in error) will yield:<br />
<br />
24.15 damage advantage per rip hit *<br />
2 mobs hit attempts per second<br />
0.5617 accuracy<br />
1.8 rip attacks per pc rip round<br />
0.04 pc rip rate<br />
<br />
The same accuracy figure can be used for frontal attacks since both weapons will take the same relative d/p/r attack losses as a percentage of attacks made.<br />
<br />
That yields a rip dps advantage for VDD of 1.95 dps.<br />
Using the same average hit factor for VDD as GBoC that would yield 85.30 dps + 1.95 rip advantage dps for a total of 87.25 dps.<br />
<br />
This 87.25 dps compares to the pure melee 87.41 dps of GBoC.<br />
<br />
Perhaps more expressively they could be listed as this:<br />
<br />
VDD melee DPS = 0.9759 GBoC DPS + (0.9767 dps * mob attack rate)<br />
<br />
(this being valid ONLY for this average hit factor of 3.45)<br />
<br />
VDD doesn't outdamage GBoC in melee, BUT in tanking situations it can come very, very, very close.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kether</div><div class="date">10-22-2003, 02:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some general points of notes that should be regarded when taking this data into any sort of class balance debate.  Since I won't enter into the debate of who is over/under/balanced and am simply listing additional factors I consider this a credible post for this thread.<br />
<br />
1. These were UNHASTED.  Haste will increase melee DPS but not proc or imbue proc DPS, hence their value as a percent of total DPS will diminish.  The melee component can easily be normalized to full haste as full haste dps = (listed dps*2/listed haste).<br />
<br />
2. All non disc supplemental attacks should be considered, whether 'small' or not.  These include warrior kick, knight 2h bash, etc.<br />
<br />
3. Where would  the Quarm hammer (Hammer of the Timeweaver) fit in as DPS (the monk shinai being already mentioned as too-be parsed)?<br />
<br />
4. This parse is strictly rear DPS.  Frontal DPS isn't a large concern for rogues (obviously) but frontal and side DPS *is* a concern for others.  Hence tactical mastery as well as class-role-appropriate strike through items should be considered.<br />
<br />
5. Imbue procs should be counted, this includes spells as well as items that allow same to non casters.<br />
<br />
6. The bow data has to take into account the current 'vision' of bows.  Are they to be the *preferred* sustainable DPS method OR are they back to true situational desirability (largely fights that are ranged or fast transitioning by nature of the encounter).</div></div><hr />

Denron has 5 more CE than you do, which would explain the difference. All proc data was done by hand to avoid anything screwy like double crit blasts due to the buggy message coding. Also the riposte/dodge/parry thing happens to any mob when you get too close to their backside, i.e. touching their back. You have to position carefully. If you were using the SoT you also have to realize that you will push the mob out of range sometimes, which will make your DPS take a small hit. Unfortunately this is something unique to the monk with an SoT and short of sitting there and manually adjusting the monk to follow the mob around for 10+ hours, cannot be avoided. As far as the Kick/Strike issue, I had to set the hotkey program to 61 tenths of a second on the refresh, thankfully it's a zero lag zone. The only thing I could do to counter this is take it down to 19-21 tenths of a second and emulate 'button mashing.'</div></div><hr />

Well, he never got oor of me during the 4.5 hours I had with him.  But he was pushed around.  And I did get a total of 20 combined ripostes, dodges, and parries when he was swimming back.<br />
<br />
When I mean screwy math on the dps, I mean the math.<br />
From Denron.<br />
Total kick damage 563096 in 830.5 minutes.<br />
Listed as 11.8 dps.<br />
<br />
Doing the math I get 11.3 dps.  <br />
<br />
Probably just an error in reported duration, which is nothing.<br />
<br />
Does Denron have elemental BP?<br />

I reparsed Denron for nearly 17 hours with Silver Bracelet of Speed as haste (41%). Sadly there was absolutely nothing I could do about his attack rating. 1533 was as good as it got. I thought I should add this in as a miscellaneous tidbit:<br />
<br />
You cannot see your target. messages: 14<br />
Your target is too far away, get closer! messages: 1,090 out of 77,440 lines.<br />
<br />
Again, due to the nature of the proc on the SOT, the mob in question was sometimes pushed too far to hit and half a second of melee would be lost each of those times. I'm not sure what that equates to in lost DPS nor am I going to do the math to figure it out.<br />
<br />
All I can conclude about monks dps is that they should probably be given Flurry.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For soloing, paladins would always have their self-haste spell, and rogues can't really backstab.<br />
<br />
For grouping, rangers would always have their +ATK buff spells, other classes usually wouldn't. <br />
<br />
The thing it is closest to is fully raid buffed. On a raid, everyone would be fully hasted and potentially have the same set of offensive buffs (depending how chummy you are with your local shamans/beastlords), so buff availability is not an issue.<br />
<br />
So you might think the parse would be useful for that, and given the people who did the parse, I guess that's its purpose. Unfortunately, that assumes that the missing buffs would affect each class proportionately. For haste, that works, but I'm not sure it does for ATK buffs.<br />
<br />
I've never seen a good parse, but it seems obvious that archery in particular is a lot more affected by higher ATK than melee, as there is no damage bonus. On the other hand, backstab damage is less affected by ATK, as it tends to  bump up against a fixed cap. What's more, if ATK does have diminishing returns, it's likely that an ATK buff would do more for paladins, who start from a lower baseline, than for warriors. And then finally, weapons of different delays/damage bonuses are affected slightly differently by +ATK.<br />
<br />
I doubt you could get a shaman and BL to sit there and buff you for 8 hours, but it would be interesting to see the results of an hours parsing with SoP/SoT on all classes. That should at least give an idea of the trend.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rajsy</div><div class="date">10-23-2003, 08:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Rangers always cast SoP and SoT on people that need it on raids.

You're right. I rarely see paladins, warriors, rangers, monks, and rogues in melee from behind.<br />
<br />
For soloing, paladins would always have their self-haste spell, and rogues can't really backstab<br />
Except the parses aren't to compare soloability.  They're to compare the absolute base melee power of these classes.  The minute you add self-buffs, the pure melees get even more edged out by the manafags.  <br />
<br />
And you're wrong about rogues: I &quot;really&quot; CAN backstab when solo.  Really!  There's the opening backstab.  Then Chaotic Stab.  And I can strafe around mobs that cast, for the full damage.  <br />
<br />

<br />
This is the reason why buffs weren't used.  Do you think the conclusions would be more favorable if the Paladin had larger gains on high ATK than other classes?  That, not only is he 85% of a warrior out of the box, but he gains MORE from the EXACT SAME BUFFS?  This would be GOOD NEWS??<br />
<br />
Ignoring that dilemma, You are again wrong about rogues and backstab damage.  The damage range on it, for me, is 150 to 847, non-crit.  Without high levels of ATK, I tend to land more hits in the lower half of that range.<br />
<br />
Compare that 697 dmg spread with archery.  I think you'll find they are very similar.  <br />
<br />
Which is why you see me with 67 dps from a 7-second refresh backstab, and 118 DPS from Drewon spamming arrows.  He gets more chances at the RNG, and I have a high minimum damage to offset my long re-use timer.</div></div><hr />

Or maybe he gains less because he is using a 2hander and the warrior isn't. You can speculate, I can speculate, only a parse will show for sure.<br />

<br />
About 20 of your 67 DPS comes from the minimum damage, which is not affected by ATK. Even if ATK has an equal affect on damage added, it will be a smaller percentage to you because of that higher base damage.<br />
<br />
Anyway, you can do math, I can do math, only a parse will show for sure.<br />

<br />
Who's talking percentages?   If my average hit goes up 50 points, and his average hit goes up 50 points, he gains more DPS, NOT because of my minimum damage, but because he can fire off more arrows in 7 seconds than I can backstab.<br />
<br />
Your assumption about ATK affecting backstab DPS less than archery was correct, you are just using the wrong explanation as to why.</div></div><hr />

My only concern would be not accounting for Yaulping but I think with the right gear (max DEX and some Haste) you can still get a good idea of what the numbers are.  And in case you do go for it, here's what Yaulp does:<br />

A few notes. Again, this test was done totally buffless. The beastlord pet did have the +2 damage augment, but no other buffs or items. Also of note is that the BST pet for this test was stopping its attacks once every 10 minutes for some reason and then restarting. This caused some lost DPS. Additionally, I rounded up the damage from the proc of the Battle Fists but it SHOULD be noted that the proc is a variable damage proc ranging from 50-100. This added some DPS. We'll just call it even from the lost pet dps to the minute added proc DPS for the offhand.<br />
<br />
Even without a pet the BST is putting out some respectable damage. For reference I've included the Magelo. http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=697663<br />

DboW/EoE anywhere close to enable you to hit the mob from the back? I dont have any of the weaps your talking about so yes im a freaking noob, but out of my tank stomach id really say no u will have the mob facing you sooner or later (unless you have SK or Pal is tanking) while with a VDD you have a nice chance of doing said constant dps in mobs back.<br />
<br />
If your thread was not about Dps at all (eg. only for showing warriors should get better shineys/aa/or dmg output) then im sorry for getting it wrong (english is second language only).<br />
<br />
With current known drops my dream would be:<br />
DboW+nice FB shield for tanking <br />
VDD with slot 8 -&gt; 5 dps aug for doing dmg as a warrior.<br />
<br />
Beside all this it would be interresting to see a 6 hour parse using all offensive discs to see their usefullness considdering reuse time.....but then you rarely will have 6 hour fights in EQ reality.</div></div><hr />

Knights are supposed to do 80% of warrior base damage using equivalent weapons so something is obviously wrong with this itemization.  In truth once you add in +atk and all the AA the gap should probably widen not close and should be closer to 75%.  Equivalent weapons should be paladin using 2h vs warrior dual wielding though, problem of course being that dual wield is broken minorly from a dps standpoint and more majorly because of the riposte issues.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Where did you answer the question?<br />
<br />
I seriously want to know what you think would be a proper warrior-usable 2hander in Phase 5.<br />
<br />
Nothing against warriors, but I have to say that I think implementing a &quot;warrior only&quot; two-hander in Phase 5 would be uncalled for and rather ignorant.  There is an existing weapon there for warriors that provides aggro in previously unseen amounts.  It happens to be one-handed, with a ratio reflecting that the DPS could be enhanced by a high-ratio weapon in the off-hand, and that a more defensive combination could be possible by using a shield (if providing somewhat weak relative aggro when this configuration is used alongside equally geared melees).<br />
<br />
If this theoretical two-hander were usable by other classes, it would not address any sort of balance issue.  In order for it to be practical, it would need to be superior to Vanazir in aggro, but then you end up with a weapon that is essentially a carbon copy of the Blade of War with a few numbers tweaked and probably an Anger proc instead of Enraging Blow.<br />
<br />
So what exactly is it that you are expecting to get when you ask for a warrior two-hander in Wave 5?  The Greatblade and Staff of Transcendence are not class-specific weapons, and as such, lack Time abilities such as Strikethrough, Accuracy, or whatnot, in addition to having lower statistics in comparison to the class-specific counterparts in Wave 5.<br />
<br />
It is not enough that Warriors do the most damage with Vanazir?  Enough that it approaches the damage of a monk using a weapon with a powerfully superior ratio, and exceeds the damage of a knight using a weapon with a greater ratio.<br />
<br />
This isn't a rant.  This is an explanation why I think an answer would honestly be in order.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Torrin</div><div class="date">11-18-2003, 07:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I seriously want to know what you think would be a proper warrior-usable 2hander in Phase 5. <br />
<br />
We eat twice (or more) ripostes dual wielding.  Since damage spikes are the reason we die, this is significant.  Knights end up taking less damage over time than us because of them.  The darkblade + EoE combo also requires two drops and two augments.  Thats one item and augment we could have spent on ac/hp.  Lastly, most of us want a flaming axe instead of a stumpy 1h BoW.<br />
<br />
Nothing against warriors, but I have to say that I think implementing a &quot;warrior only&quot; two-hander in Phase 5 would be uncalled for and rather ignorant. <br />
<br />
More ignorant than a knight only phase 5 2h?<br />
<br />
There is an existing weapon there for warriors that provides aggro in previously unseen amounts. <br />
<br />
ONLY with anger 3s, and ONLY paired with an EoE.<br />
<br />
It happens to be one-handed, with a ratio reflecting that the DPS could be enhanced by a high-ratio weapon in the off-hand <br />
<br />
You did see the parses in this thread, right?  The darkblade parses had the best possible ratio offhands.  You need to pair a darkblade with another time-level weapon to beat the dps of a VDD.  A darkblade paired with a 15/20 offhand parsed less dps than a blade of war.  Did I mention that I eat twice the ripostes dual wielding?<br />
<br />
and that a more defensive combination could be possible by using a shield <br />
<br />
Shields are GAY.  Hence why knights use them.  I will never use a shield.  I prefer mobs to not turn away from me or summon people.<br />
<br />
If this theoretical two-hander were usable by other classes, it would not address any sort of balance issue. <br />
<br />
Your point?  We arn't asking for a 2h usable by other classes.<br />
<br />
 In order for it to be practical, it would need to be superior to Vanazir in aggro <br />
<br />
duh<br />
<br />
you end up with a weapon that is essentially a carbon copy of the Blade of War with a few numbers tweaked and probably an Anger proc instead of Enraging Blow. <br />
<br />
All my weapons are carbon copies of other weapons with tweaked numbers and a different proc.<br />
<br />
The Greatblade and Staff of Transcendence are not class-specific weapons, and as such, lack Time abilities such as Strikethrough, Accuracy, or whatnot, in addition to having lower statistics in comparison to the class-specific counterparts in Wave 5. <br />
<br />
So give us a warrior only 2h weapon with a time ability and higher statistics?<br />
<br />
It is not enough that Warriors do the most damage with Vanazir? Enough that it approaches the damage of a monk using a weapon with a powerfully superior ratio, and exceeds the damage of a knight using a weapon with a greater ratio. <br />
<br />
We do the most damage with a Vanazir?  Have you even read the DPS parse thread?<br />
<br />
Check the Behe parse: 109 dps (augment damage subtracted) with a Vanazir vs. Denron's 135+ dps.  In actuallity the monk dps should be close to 140 due to the push of the weapon.  Monks with Shinais are doing 150.  How is this &quot;close&quot;?<br />
<br />
The knight parse with an augmented GBoC was 102 dps.  Add a knight's dps proc, and you'd esentialy tie the dps of an Anger 3 augmented VDD.  Did I mention knights (which are HYBRIDS btw - look the word up) are supposed to do less melee damage than PURE (another word to look up) melee?<br />
<br />
I think an answer would honestly be in order. <br />
<br />

The question is what do you expect to be reasonably capable of asking for without getting laughed at.  Yes, riposte, etc.  Whatever.  That isn't related to the question that was asked.<br />
<br />
The parses in the stickied thread do not show a monk with Vanazir.  They show a monk using a vastly superior weapon.  Denron's parse shows...<br />
<br />
# Crush DPS: 113.72 <br />
<br />
Behemoth's Parse...<br />
<br />
Crush DPS: 105.64 <br />

The difference in weapon ratio alone will account for more than that difference, I believe.<br />
<br />
Brael's Vanazir parse showed...<br />
<br />
# DPS: 85.54 <br />
<br />
Both parses with the Greatblade of Chaos showed 87-88 dps in raw melee.  Please note that the only melees who have their class-specific weapons in Phase 4 are knights, thus these weapons are of slightly lower quality than the counterparts in Phase 5.<br />
<br />
Are Warriors so special that they deserve two class specific weapons in Phase 5?  This is not a &quot;woe is [random class here]&quot; post.  If anyone can seriously answer &quot;yes&quot; to the question that they feel warriors deserve special consideration, then tell me what kind of weapon you expect.  That was the question that has been danced around in the first place, which is why I bothered posting.</div></div><hr />

Who cares about monk dps with a Vanazir?  First of all, the Vanazir isn't something monks should even want.  They have two better time weapons to consider.  Second, a monk with a Shini is going to be doing way more than any warrior, with or without this new fictional phase 5 2h.  Third, Shinais are the monk class weapon and they are in phase 4.  It just also happens to be the bst class weapon.<br />
<br />
I don't know what you are reading, but the DPS thread clearly shows that SK doing 90.7 dps to the RED con in innovation with a Vanazir.<br />
<br />
And if you decide to exclude GBoC proc dps, of course the number is going to be less.  I could haste my warrior and be doing unhasted rogue dps, but that wouldn't be fair either.<br />
<br />
Most warriors did not want a 1h class weapon in the first place.  What we wanted was our time weapon to have been a 2h, not two time weapons.  What I PERSONALY want, is a 2h with slightly more dps than a Vanazir (proc damage factored in) that procs frenzying blow with a level 68 0 second stun.  The weapon should be high damage, high delay.  Oh, and it has to be a flaming axe.</div></div><hr />

How about the changes you suggested be added in top of BoW, give it a new name, and put it as an Xegony drop.</div></div><hr />

*Edit* oh and make it the flaming axe, yeah :p</div></div><hr />

NO! No flaming axe. A good looking sword will do nicely. Maybe a sword like the one Mith Marr wields.</div></div><hr />

<br />
BoW graphic is hideous, one has to wonder how someone ever came up with such a design.<br />
<br />
executioner axe back in the day looked great, something along those lines.</div></div><hr />

There isn't an easy solution to that.  Except make it so warriors don't rely on their weapons to keep agro.</div></div><hr />

Simple solution is to add some type of DD to the Anger Augments. Perhaps like 50/100/150 for Anger I/II/III.</div></div><hr />

<br />
if they do add in a 2h, i think the best option would to keep the current loot table for RZ and maybe do a small quest in pok where u can turn in the dark blade for a 2h version.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Splaktar</div><div class="date">12-07-2003, 01:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Got a DBotW a couple weeks ago, about the time when the boards went down.  I had used a VDD for a couple months and liked it a lot, but was still looking to get more aggro.  I picked up the DBotW cause no other wars at the raid wanted it much and our wars who were really looking for one weren't online.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, I certainly have no regretted it.  It's been a great weapon for holding aggro so far.  Combined with my SoPM my aggro holding abilities have increased greatly.  I even did all of Tier 1-4 last night w/ DBotW and an AoE I also just picked up.  I had no aggro problems at all until wizards over aggro'd on TT.  But Tier 1-3 went just fine, even against SU paladins in undead trial.  I think with anger3, some combat effects, 46% haste, Bertox boots, and raex BP... holding aggro should be no problem at all even with a shield....<br />
<br />
I also ran some DPS tests w/o ambidex and DBotW/SoPP came out well above DBotW/EoE.  With ambidex I think EoE might pull ahead, but I'm not sure.  I was quite surprised by the results.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, just 2 more Guk adventures to open up Anger3...</div></div><hr />
