<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">1) <br />
Frostreaver (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=4687) <br />
<br />
2) GSoT<br />
<br />
I removed the WMBS from consideration since it has no innate proc.<br />
<br />
Both weapons have a stun, Frostreaver has a 125dd component also.  GSoT is fugly.<br />
<br />
Any feel for the comparative effectiveness of these weapons?  I am tanking with Frostreaver in hard LDoNs, and am having no problems.<br />
<br />
Assuming stuns don't get nerfed soon, I am contenplating where to put an anger3 augment.   I was going to augment one of my 1h weapons, but I take a lot of riposte damage on hard LDoNs so I am reconsidering.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Greyslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Seems like a lot of warriors swear by GSoT so that's what I would say.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Partha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Depends on if I want aggro or not.<br />
<br />
 If I do, GSoT.<br />
<br />
 If I don't, Sombrous Claidmore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">anger3 is a ton of saved points for an item, i hope you plan on using it for a long time, you cant get the points back if you upgrade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Darkoan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You might want to give Greatsword of the Bloodsworn a swing also.  BTW - Be careful with the Races on the Frostreaver.  Have one rotting in my bank, damn you SOE!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lexchess</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Stun on the Frostreaver doesn't land on as high level mobs as the GSoT's stun.  Haven't parsed if the Frostreaver does more DPS, but the higher level stun on GSoT made me choose it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ceris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I played a bit with a Greatsword of the Bloodsworn.  I'd personally characterize it as spotty aggro, it doesn't seem to annoy stuff as well as a 100pp GSoT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>czai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Frostreaver is slow and never seemed to proc much for me.  I used it once or twice situationally before moving to GSoT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>seveirn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">&lt;--- Axe of Kromzek kings + Ykesha proc = Sufficiant agro, Fast DPS. its a good combo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Cimmar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I have a frostreaver and used it for a long time before getting my current weapons. In my experience i have been the 2nd war in some groups and several times i had to bag my frostreaver because the war was using a gsot and i generally took aggro when this was the case. Also gsot is got awfull looking</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zynth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">GSoT would out agro a frostreaver. the procs are very similar, in that they both have a stun, i believe some one did a phrase a while back that figured all stuns to generate the same agro reguardless of they worked or were resisted or not, so we can probably assume that the procs on both weapons are moot. <br />
the GSoT is faster and has a better damage ratio. if i were looking at just that, i'd go with the faster, more efficent weapon. for anyone that's grouped with a monk before all these neat weapons come out (pre PoP) will tell you that nothing short of a BoC would take agro off a monk, who back then, were just damage and speed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>warcry</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Bah that pisses me off, though they are ugly as sin<br />
I passed on  GSoT because allakhazam's didnt list it as a stun, guildies said it didnt have a stun either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jarelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Gaudralek, Sword of the Sky is sweet, I still use it when trying to avoid aggro in raids...2hs Epic is pretty nice too...under-rated in my opinion.</div></div><hr />

I passed on  GSoT because allakhazam's didnt list it as a stun, guildies said it didnt have a stun either. http://lucy.allakhazam.com, formerly http://lucy.fnord.net.  Definitive info for your next investigation ;).  The Greatstaff of Thunder does say &quot;Planar Stun&quot; on it, mebbe your thinking of something else.  The good news is, it's pretty easy to pick one up for about 100 plat in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I parsed an evening of Hard LDoN using the GSoT and the Frostreaver.  Of course, buffs could have been slightly different, etc. Further, I'd switch to primal and blue epic to get an Avatar proc whenever I needed one.<br />
<br />
In any event, Frostreaver parsed out at 90 DPS, the GSoT at 103.  Safe to say that GSoT has a little more pull than the Frostreaver.  I held aggro fine w both however.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Renix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I'd definately go with the GSoT, its faster, has a better ratio (better DPS), and the stun proc works on higher level mobs. While that isn't important for agro, it is nice to be able to actually be able to interupt casters and such with a successful stun and not take damage for a second or two.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kailyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Well other than the fact that Frostreaver is no drop and GSoT is about 50 plat...<br />
<br />
I found, agro wise that there was almost no differance between the two. Sure the Frostreaver wont  land on anything higher than 55, but that does not mean the agro is bad.<br />
<br />
How ever, 99% of the time I find that I have better agro with WMBS over GSoT, so eliminating it for no proc may be a bit hasty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Ygnir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">In my experience, the GSoT doesn't even come close to the Frostreaver, Frostreaver absolutely owns the GsoT. I've used my Frostreaver for a really long time, when the GSoT came out I tried one out for a week or so (In BoT) and my group made me return the GSoT to it's owner and go back to my axe.  Also, wheter the stun part is resisted or not, the proc was simply amazing aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Flair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">i had to bag my frostreaver because the war was using a gsot and i generally took aggro when this was the case<br />
<br />
This might have been a factor of a disparity in AAs (ferocity, PB, Flurry etc), lvl or any number of other things between the two of you.  Weapon to weapon I believe I'd go with the GSoT.  Also an augmented GSoT is a monster agro machine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Eriatha Egan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Judgement of Ice really seems to turn mob's heads.  It's prolly no more than Planar Stun, but hey, it's cool sounding.<br />
<br />
I have a Frostreaver and I bust it out occassionally.  Yeah yeah, I have a Blade of Carnage and Greatstaff of the Four Winds, but those weapons get a little boring every now and then, hehe.  The Frostreaver is a very solid agro weapon with a decent procrate to boot.  Not to mention, the DD portion is on a -100cr modifier, so it's almost always 125pts every time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Ahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">It occurs to me that since Frostreaver is about 33% slower than GSoT, I take 33% less riposte damage.  This is for a cost of about 10% of my offensive output.  Given that I am barely tough enough to do hard LDoNs, this might be a good way for me to conserve the cleric's mana.</div></div><hr />
