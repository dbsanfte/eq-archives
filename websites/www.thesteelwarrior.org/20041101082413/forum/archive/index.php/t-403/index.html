<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>CasEci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Get a Druid partner, and head thee to Jagged Pine. I went there at 48 to the Poachers and stayed there til they went LB. (54-55, named were still DB at 55) Pretty fair exp, not shabby loot. (coin and pelts) Just be careful, stay away from the river, nasty MoB's called Potiamids can ruin your day. Never been to Velks, so can't help ya there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">solb. at 49 all the mobs where still DB besides some which where LB so they should all be DB. get a partner and do king/champs roon or solo window/ent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">thanks, jagged pine is to laggy for me, so ill do solb</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dobbo Baggins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">aye or LGuK duo. maybe BW. 47-50 wasn't anything easy i liked solb the best tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i went to sol b, and only 1 person there! whats wrong with the players today? grrrrr</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Beornegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">What's wrong with players today? They're lazy.  They'd rather have a big outdoor leveling treadmill that's nice and safe and boring than go into a dungeon and have some  fun.   In defense of that I will say that given the state of the game and the players right now, I'd rather have a pickup group in DL than in KC, because you usually don't know the skill level of your pickup group until it's too late. :)  The warrior class was designed for dungeon crawls (like all the pure melees, clerics, and chanters).  If you want to do a dungeon, your best bet is bring friends.  Otherwise, just go to DL and lfg.   Sad but that 's just the way things are right now.<br />
