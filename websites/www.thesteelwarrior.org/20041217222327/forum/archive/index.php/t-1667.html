<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ariene</div><div class="date">07-02-2003, 06:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've never played a melee past level six but I've played priests for a long time and I've noticed some things.  A tank friend and I had a discussion which ended with him saying &quot;you'd understand if you ever played a melee&quot; which didn't really answer my questions so I came here.  He was an SK but I like your board better.  :)<br />
<br />
Positioning - Who's job is it to make sure the mob stays off the walls and out of range of adds?  In a raid, I've noticed it is usually the MA or the raid leader telling melee where to push it (or more often not to push it) but in an experience group...  <br />
<br />
We were in a dungeon and I asked him to turn the mob so that no one had to pass him to get behind it.  I asked him to just turn it so I could hit it from where I was instead of running around it.  I figured this would make it easier for the rogue and monk to hit it from behind as well.  It seemed to me that the less time they have to take running around the mob the sooner it would be dead.  The main reason I wanted it turned was that I figured if we got an add it would be much better hitting the tank so I could heal him then beating on me and having heals interupted.  He told me his job was just to hold agro and the melee would get behind it and if I was a melee I would understand.  <br />
<br />
I think it is the little things that seperate the good tanks from the adequate tanks.  Knowing when to /shield and positioning the mob so the rest of the group isn't wasting time running around it (and being more vulnerable to any adds) tend to signal a better than average warrior to me.  Am I wrong? <br />
<br />
Also, what do clerics who try to melee do to annoy?  I never meleed before they came out with the hammer but I find now that if I have a good tank I have more mana than I know what to do with so I figure the little DPS I can add is better than sitting on my butt medding when I'm full mana.  But since the melee thing is so new to me I don't know what NOT to do.  I try to get behind the mob but a little to the side so that the rogue gets the very back.  I try to pick the oposite side of the ranger who is shooting arrows.  Other than that what can I be doing to make everyone's life easier and not be in the way?<br />
<br />
Hope you don't mind my questions.  I know cleric stuff pretty well but I'm a complete newbie to warriors.  The only other post I made here I got called &quot;shielded one&quot; which I kinda liked so I'm keeping it.  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
at least that's the rule i go by when tanking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rade</div><div class="date">07-02-2003, 07:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In my opinion it is the tanks job to position the mob in an experience group.  I would never plant my feet in one spot and tell my group &quot;I'm not moving.&quot;  I consider it my job to position the mob for the monk and rogue to hit it better and also to be set up in the position closest to adds so that, like you say, beat on me instead of anyone else.<br />
<br />
As for clerics meleeing, I have no problem with it.  I have grouped with a good cleric friend for 60 levels now and he has always meleed under the right circumstances.  As soon as there is a hint of an add he's off the mob and ready with heals and even when he's meleeing he's never missed a heal.  I think as long as you can still heal and melee there's no problem.<br />
<br />
As for /shield, well, personally I think it's useless and I've only ever used it a handfull of times, mainly when I first got it.  In raids where I am the MT I'm way to far away from the caster ranks for it to be useful and by the time I try to type /shield &lt;most recently summoned casters name here&gt; on a raid they're either dead or away safely.  In experience groups it's also not useful as the wizard and enchanter I group with stay well out of melee.  /shield's range won't let me protect them far away, and if an add happens upon them the enchanter has it mezed quickly anyway.</div></div><hr />

wether it's in a exp group or a raid.<br />
<br />
As for warriors, the Tank's job isn't really to get aggro (sadly), although we try as hell to get it :p..<br />
the aggro part is the group's job (or that's how soe wants it :/ )<br />
<br />
Imo, the Tank's two greatest job, is to &quot;try&quot; and get as much aggro as possible, AND move the mob around intelligently.<br />
<br />
For groups, you put yourself closest to any eventual adds.<br />
If theres no eventual adds, I put myself between the mob and the casters. So if I lose aggro, the mob has to run through me before hitting casters, giving me more time to hit Taunt and make a little prayer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valeris</div><div class="date">07-02-2003, 09:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Definately positioning is the single most important job of a 'tank' in raid or Exp. - so long as you can get 'some' aggro :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mazzarek</div><div class="date">07-02-2003, 09:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, positioning is definately the tank's job.  I've recently started using &quot;sit&quot; aggro quite a bit for positioning.<br />
<br />
It might be nice to position the mob such that the rogues don't need to run around the mob, but I'd rather have a proc or two anyway before they start unleashing backstabs, so I don't necessarily position with rogues in mind.  Also, I may be wrong about this, but I'm pretty sure rangers (maybe it's AA, or maybe they get it at a certain level) can shoot through PCs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fvighlander</div><div class="date">07-02-2003, 09:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Most of the time, exp groups set up camp along a wall somewhere, and I prefer to have the mob being pushed toward the wall to avoid getting adds or needing to turn it around constantly... bout the only time I would make an exception is if I'm grouped with a high dps archery ranger, and it's more beneficial to the group to keep his dps than to keep a &quot;safer&quot; mob position.<br />
<br />
Most of the time, the majority of this type of push is done by pets... beastlord warders and mage pets can push a mob like nobody's business. As long as they're on the correct side, the mob goes where I want it to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valeris</div><div class="date">07-02-2003, 09:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was always surprised on raids how many melee seem to just hit attack and sit there without any thought to shifting position so that the mob isn't pushed off cliffs and etc. :rolleyes: It's not just the MT's job :)<br />
<br />
In a group i prefer to be facing the party, if i loose aggro I can immediately react to the mobs movement and be positioned to taunt back that little bit faster...</div></div><hr />

<br />
So true.  Our last Chardok Raid ended because some melee wasnt watching where they were pushing the mobs.  Ended up pushing one over and they brought quite an impressive amount of friends.  I'm pretty sure that melee isnt going to be doing anything like that again.<br />
<br />
Positioning is a learning process.  Problem is that a lot of people only learn it when they mess up and wipe the raid.  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ragnarz</div><div class="date">07-02-2003, 10:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You have it all wrong ! ! !<br />
<br />
The role of positioning lies in the hands of the uber wizard or lifeburning necro. Mages aspire to these heights.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Braeorn</div><div class="date">07-02-2003, 10:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Simple.<br />
<br />
1.  Tanks are repsonsible for positioning in both raid and xp groups (duh).<br />
<br />
2. Clerics should melee ONLY when they have a mount. There is nothing more ridiculous than downtime because a cleric wants to whack a few mobs and gleefully watch their hammer's insane proc.<br />
<br />
3. Shield is definately not useless. As most enchanters will tell you it often saves their bacon while slowing. Shamans too, but normally they have enough HP to survive on their own.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ariene</div><div class="date">07-02-2003, 11:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Originally posted by Braeorn <br />

<br />
I don't think many clerics melee using the horse/lizard.  Yaulp doesn't stack with it and since we never actually hit anything and do all our damage from procs we need the dex from yaulp or we might as well not stand up.  I melee 'till I hit 75-80 mana and then I sit and med until I'm 90+ again.  I consider the first 80m heal mana and the last 20m dps mana.  If I have to rebuff the group I might need a short (one minute ish) med break.  If the puller comes back with four when we were expecting one I might need a med break afterward.  But meleeing doesn't cause med breaks unless your cleric is an idiot.<br />
<br />
The melee question wasn't really about when it is appropriate to melee - I know how to manage mana fine and can keep a chain pulling group healed even with no clarity.  What I was asking was how not to get in the way or slow down the real dps people.  We all know my dps isn't much so I don't want to get in the way of the real melee while I play with my toy hammer.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
<br />
In truth I've played with some, but the majority don't, I agree.<br />
<br />
I actually forgot about the yaulp thing, so I retract what I said. I will say the Future Glue Product and Suitcase animal will still help quicker recovery.  ;)<br />
<br />
As far as not getting in the way, having the MT flip the mob was a reasonable request....with one caveat. There are times in tighter quarters where keeping the MT in-between the mob and the casters is much better in case they get agg. Sometimes running around the the backhitters and getting stuck on the wall to throw a taunt/shield can be too late.</div></div><hr />

If they pull agro with tash I have a chance to catch it with taunt as it runs through me.  If I&quot;m on the far side of the mob I'll be oor with taunt.<br />
<br />
As was noted, we need a few seconds of solo time to lock down agro, which the rogues and monk can use to get in position.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raunstonecutter</div><div class="date">07-02-2003, 12:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the warriors job it to try to make the group as effiecent as possible by making sure they take the hits and that mob is positioned in such a way that it takes advantage of the groups abilities.<br />
<br />
That job is easier said than done!  What I do is I try to position the mobs with their back the to the camp, and away from the walls.  Rangers who twang away with their bows apprecate it.  Casters with LoS DDs apprecate it too.  I also try to make sure all pets are fighting the mobs rear.  Lately, I haven't had to use my /shield command, but I usually use it on the slower, since they pull the most agro the quickest.  I find that /shield really comes into play in the mobs first 20% of life, after that, I usually have rock solid agro, though not always.<br />
<br />
A good warrior will know how to adjust to the abilities of the group.  They will use that knowledge to position mobs accordingly.  They will /shield to keep their group mates alive, and make life easier on their healers.   They will also be open to any new and free DPS to the group.  I trust clerics to know their stuff at 65.  If they want to melee, hell, go nuts =)  Just so long as I get my heal =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">07-02-2003, 12:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Most rogues are pretty damn quick at getting behind a mob, so I generally don't turn mobs for them.  Half the time if I do they are already on the other side by the time I get him turned and have to run around again.  I do turn mobs for pets though, and I agree that mob positioning is the MT's job in both exp groups and raids.  It always annoys me when warriors bitch about pushing in situations where they have more control over the mob's position than anyone in the raid.  This only applies in situations where they have solid aggro however.  I have found I can't move mobs nearly as effectively using an SoD as I could with my blade of carnage, but I still consider positioning the mob primarily my job. <br />
<br />
As far as /shield goes, I never used it on my old warrior.  Nowadays I find I lose aggro much more often and I have /shield macroed and use it often.  It definitely makes a difference and the range is larger than it was when it first came out.  Now I can usually shield someone that is on the opposite side of the mob from me, which I didn't used to be able to do.  Any chanter that groups with me has been /shielded many times. <br />
<br />
As far as cleric melee goes, there won't be a lot of problem with melees being able to hit in an exp group.  Rogues can BS pretty much 180 degrees and I think rangers can hit with people around the mob now so as long as you aren't pushing it off of a cliff I wouldn't worry too much about where you are.  Hitting from behind is always good though, because you will do more damage and not eat ripostes.   The only time I don't like to see casters meleeing is on a raid.  The other night in VT one of the rogues was complaining that he couldn't get to the mob because there were wizards and druids meleeing (on yard trash).  As long as your not causing downtime in exp groups I say go for it.  Also meleeing on a horse is hard to do and they are much bigger and harder to move around than players so I would have to say the opposite of what Braeorn said.  I would rather you not be on a horse if you're going to melee.<br />
<br />
It's nice to see a cleric posting here.  Warriors and clerics always work together in game so it's great to have clerics reading/posting on this board.  I wish there were more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hyardgune</div><div class="date">07-02-2003, 12:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">XP group positioning is the tanks job.  If I have rogues and other melees I'm not too worried about positioning other than being close to the slower.  They can manage to get behind it just fine.  When dealing with rogue pets, then I worry more about positioning but that isn't usually a big concern.<br />
<br />
As for clerics in melee, so long as you heal me, just stand behind the mob and whack at it all you want.  I'll curse SoE for that bloody proc rate as you spam my screen but other than that, just stand further from the mob than me and behind it and you will be fine.  It still makes me itch to watch finger-wigglers in melee but if you all are having fun and doing your job, what do I care?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just a FYI but clerics and other casters dont get sitting mana regen while they have auotattack on regardless if they have a mount.  If they did you would see every caster in the game meleeing at all times and all hybrids would have their horses up while meleeing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Calinthalus</div><div class="date">07-02-2003, 02:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Generally speaking when I pull for a group, I'll pull the mob right up to the shaman and stand between the shaman and the mob.  For some reason this has helped with my agro control tremendously.  After I get the &quot;Yawn&quot; message I make sure I still have agro before I start really positioning.  Out of habit I avoid &quot;walling&quot; mobs because I group with Rangers alot, and the DPS from a AM3 Ranger is greatly increased when the mob isn't walled.  Second I tend to rotate the mob to where the Mage pet is at his back.  Quite frankly screw the rogue, he can move.  Most rogues are quick and not too concearned with you &quot;giving&quot; them the back, they will go take it.  However, pet's aren't so easy to move around so I try to help the mage out if he has a Backstab pet up.<br />
<br />
Now as far as melee goes for clerics, try to stay beside the rogue somewhere behind the mob, and attack from max distance.  Just hit attack and move back till you get &quot;you are too far away&quot; then take a step or so forward.  Proximity agro does happen and I'd much prefer your mana being dumped into me than into yourself.  I have no trouble with clerics melee'ing as long as they are good clerics that know when/where to melee.  The first time I hear &quot;ok I'm out of mana&quot; from a cleric that's been up melee'ing the entire time......and we haven't had multiples in camp or a rebuff session; at this point I might try and politely suggest they not melee.  But someone that just doesn't like a cleric to fight when they have mana running out of their ears is an idiot, the DPS from that hammer is better than mine (not that it's hard to get better DPS than a warrior) so more dead mobs=more xp.<br />
<br />
disclaimer: most of this was regarding xp group only.  Strategy may vary depending on location/mob/group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brokkah Narrow</div><div class="date">07-02-2003, 02:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Brutal, I'd say on a raid the position of the mob is in the hands of the rest of the raid, not the warrior. The warrior gets to choose which direction the mob points, and thats it. All other push is in the hands of melee + pets. If you have 30 people all pushing a mob laterally then the warrior can do nothing to rectify it. Having enough aggro to lead a mob by the nose will help(rarely happens these days for me anyway :P), but at the end of the day it is down to raid discipline amongst the other players to ensure a mob is pushed around intelligently.<br />
<br />
Exp group mob position is pretty much in the hands of the warrior, I agree :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
um if your on a mount and meleeing you are not rtegaining mana. if attack is on youloose the advantage of being on a horse. if the cleric is meleeing you want them on thier feet using yaulp 5 as it adds 10 mana regen per tick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gryzx</div><div class="date">07-02-2003, 02:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Having grouped with Ariene before, I'd say that you're doing fine what you're doing.  She keeps plenty full on mana, and it's fun to watch her play wizard when you bring in an undead guy.<br />
<br />
As far as positioning and shielding, I try my best to be in control of the mob's position.  Usually I will turn the mob's back towards the group if I can, this does more than allow the rogue to not have to run around or the pets to be on the backside, it also allows me to easily run after the mob if it aggros someone.  Running forward to me is much easier than backward.  By setting it up that way I can usually hit taunt as I chase after the mob and have it back hitting me before it hits anyone.  There are a few situations that I don't do this, usually if I'm not it's because of the walls/corner possibly interferring with a ranger's shots or a mages bolts.  <br />
<br />
As far as shield goes I have a hot button that assist's the mob and /shield's it's target and then assists that target (to hopefully be back targetted on the mob).  I generally use that if a caster's hp gets down to around 60pct and taunt still hasn't worked, I don't use it right off since it has a 3minute re-use time and I want to have it for the dire instance when taunt is continually not working and the caster is going to die.  Also a benefit of the way I have it setup is that if I get aggro right as I hit the shield button it ends up trying to shield myself, which doesn't waste the /shield so makes it last even longer (which does make me look silly though cuz I have a /g msg that says I'm shielding Gryzx 8p but at least it wasn't wasted).  Anyhow /shield imo has saved quite a few ppl's lifes and I think it's a pretty nice thing we get (would be nice if I never lost aggro so didn't need it, but it's nice to have since it doesn't work like that)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Garoar</div><div class="date">07-02-2003, 04:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ariene your right on, the tank is the positioner, I &quot;Try To&quot; keep the mob between me and the group so Im facing the casters incase they pull aggro I can taunt/chase it off the finger wigglers and /shield them while trying to get aggro back. of course pets and weapon procs can move a mob ALOT, but in general its the tanks job, to lead and everyone elses to help keep it there.<br />
<br />
As for CLR meleeing, my RL wife is a CLR and sadly she has a CoCW to my RBB so she has more haste than I do and decent stats so she can almost out damage me since Im in front doing less damage and not putting out the DPS of a support melee, with Yaulp 5, she goes insane proccing, anyone who would gripe about a CLR whos &quot;Almost&quot; FM all the time and meleeing (from behind the mob) adding real good DPS in a regular XP grp is a fool and doesn't like XP simple as that. <br />
I actually xped with a regular group of friends in PoS for a while 2 Rangers 2 Clerics myself and occasionally a bard or another friend on at the time, dam CLR hammer spam was insane.<br />
lets not foget CLR's get bash now also, isn't it nice to have another person bashing and casting stuns stopping mobs from gating/casting damage spells while also adding bash dmg / melee dmg insane procs and stopping multi adds ? hmm.. <br />
/sarcasm on  <br />
Naw crazy idea, CLR's need sit med and watch Jerry Springer while I save the day at a mind numbing .000001 % xp an hour <br />
/sarcasm off<br />
<br />
now if the CLR is up front getting slapped by lets say the giants in BoT for 500+ riposites and having to heal themselves and getting low health aggro and going LoM and having to take med breaks from a normal moderate pull cycle, then you have a dipshit CLR, but your situation doesn't sound like this is the case.<br />
As in any situation there are <br />
1) Ebayed people who are morons and cause more harm than good.<br />
2) Then theres the smart people who have fun and get better xp using all available tools/classes to thier advantage. <br />

The more big mobs you tank, especially with the same basic guild over and over, you start to learn things that can make you influence where the mob is going.  A lot of times turning a mob 90 degrees or flipping him or changing his angle will make people move and change how he's moving.  You don't have complete control but you have a lot of influence on where the mob goes during a raid.  I have even used sit aggro to move dragons and such from time to time.  Sometimes it doesn't work and someone will say something in guildchat like &quot;why is Brutul running around like a tard instead of tanking the mob?&quot;  but hey, nobody's perfect right?  <br />
<br />
Part of the problem with EQ is that you're trying to direct 30 melees with varying amounts of lag that are paying varying amounts of attention, trying to type and control your character with the same keyboard and using the shortest possible phrases and chances are a lot of people won't understand what you're saying, or will flat miss it in the spam, or will be watching TV over their shoulder while they hit the backstab key.  For all these reasons, if there is any way I can correct bad positioning myself, without trying to direct a whole raid full of melees, I prefer to do that.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wulfran</div><div class="date">07-02-2003, 06:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Biggest thing, and it has been mentioned, for non-melee classes, is proximity to the mob. Most exp mobs aren't really big on proximity aggro, unless rooted, but why get closer than you need to be? In exp groups I also prefer to face the rest of the group: I can see possible adds at their back if it is exposed, and my armoured backside is the first things adds will see, behind me (not to mention its nicer on pets, but thats not as big since they nerfed mob enrages).<br />
<br />
Raid positioning, I agree with Brutal in theory: anything you can do on your own, will be far better than what you can try to communicate to your guild. However you need help from your fellow meleers (usually the extra tanks) to make it work.</div></div><hr />

My ability to stay top of the aggro list by far enough to manipulate mob position by backing up, sitting or whatever seems to have diminshed to almost zero too, perhaps due to the fact I'm using the same taunter I had 6 months ago and the rest of my guild have caught up with 65 spells, new weapons etc. /shrug just seems a much bigger problem than it used to be.</div></div><hr />

Nothing more annoying then not knowing when and if a cheal is comming in then popping defensive or evasive or furious/fortude and having everyone look at you funny.

<br />
Back on topic. I find that if I get myself into a wall or corner in exp groups then it's easier for the other classes to position themselves. As brutul said above most rogues are quick and as soon as I turn the mob they are around the world and back before I know it.<br />
<br />
I don't care if the cleric melees, or the shaman, or the wizard, or the whatever as long as they can keep up with the groups pulling rate and have mana incase something goes wrong.</div></div><hr />

Like the ToV dragons if they don't pop to the corner, I find it fairly hard to get them scrunched in the corner straight off.  They'll get there eventually from people pushing it, but would be nice to be able to have em there from the start.  I'm not sure if there's anything I can do, I can hit them from the corner and it seems once I'm in melee range they stop wanting to get closer, I haven't figured out anything that will bring in a mob closer to you(besides ppl/pets pushing it) once you're in melee range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">07-03-2003, 01:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, you can't really move a mob with a big melee range into a corner by yourself, has to be a push from the melees.  Just stay as close to the mob as you can and back into the corner as the mob gets pushed.  <br />
<br />
On Seru we used to have everyone send in pet swarms at the beginning of the fight to push him into the corner quick without messing with aggro and it worked pretty well.  Have to make sure they're sending them from the right angle though hehe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If your group or raid is dumb enough to stand there and WATCH a mob inching closer and closer to a cliff/tree/other mob/whatever, and does nothing to adjust their position for push, something is wrong. <br />
<br />
A good raid or group member realizes &quot;hey...ya know, when I stand here and slash kick bash, the mob tends to move away from me. &quot;<br />
<br />
A good raid or group member will notice a mob drifting away, or notice that there are too many melee on one side, etc and adjust without being told or without me having to repeatedly sit taunt the mob into position.<br />
<br />
It's the people that like to click auto-attack and go have a sandwich that make a warriors life 10x harder. Use your head and stop cyb0ring for 5 minutes.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">weoden</div><div class="date">07-08-2003, 04:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, I just wanted to restate what some others have said.  Its the pullers job to initially position the mob and then the tanks job to get it positioned correctly.  In any case, I try to pull to the slower and then I can /shield them after slow lands.<br />
<br />
For positioning, it depends on the group really.  I prefer to face from where I pulled so I can see adds and then flip the mob after typing &quot;add&quot; and hitting aetuant.<br />
<br />
Other times I prefer to wall a mob and this is where I dont have a ranger but have 1 or more pets and space/chance of a wandering add is high.<br />
<br />
As far as pushing.  If you face your handy rogue while fighting and turn 45 degrees then you will see the mob slowly move that direction.  However, if you turn 45 the other direction then the mob will slowly shift that way.  By using this notion I can compensate for 2 melee in the back or a ranger using a bow from the side while keeping the mob staticly placed.<br />
<br />
As far as any caster meleeing, I personally don't care as long as I can chain pull at a reasonable pace.  The game is about fun...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beornegar</div><div class="date">07-08-2003, 05:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One more aside on mob positioning in xp groups:<br />
I like to pull the mob over to the slower(in  my case usually a shaman buddy), then strafe around so that I'm facing everyone else in the group, this way I can see by which way the mob is facing who it's beating on (with a good slow it's tough to tell just from melee messages sometimes).  Also, this will work when you have a rogue in the group as long as they know you'll be positioning the mob with it's back to them. If they arent aware of that you'll spend alot of time dancing around in circles with the mob and the rogue until everyone gets where they need to be, which can be quite amusing at times. :)  And as has been previously stated, things like positioning are situational and based on where you are and who you're grouped with.  And even on an unrooted mob, proximity aggro is very important, especially with regards to other melees.  I've grouped with one of my guild's epic'd rangers repeatedly, and because he knows where to stand he rarely pulls aggro and most of the time doesn't have to use jolt unless his earthcaller gets a good string of procs.  Typically if another melee is pulling aggro from a warrior, one of the easiest things for them to change about what they're doing is backing up a pace.<br />
<br />
Beo</div></div><hr />

<br />
Holding aggro and gaining aggro is not usually something a warrior can control too well.  Instead (now anyway) it's a function o frandomness.  So, a warrior holding aggro is a bit of luck (weapon procs and taunt success), combined with THE REST OF THE GROUP working with the warrior's gimp ass taunt.<br />
<br />
Mob positioning is job of MT.  The MT's job may be managed by someone else (like someone telling him what to do, like a raid leader in an EXP group or a shaman/chanter/cleric in an XP group :)  Unless your MT is ignorant of some game element I dont see why you'd need to tell the MT where to put the mob.  I guess you playing with a dumb-f*ck of an MT.  If my cleric asks me to position the mob someplace else, I'll do it unless I see a potential problem with what they are asking (like I see a mob that WOULD aggro).  Then I'll question before I reposition.  Not that complex.<br />
<br />
My wife melees with me at lvl 59 all the time.  She plays a cleric.  When we duo low dark blues for money and slow exp, she's always meleeing and got her pet up.  The extra dps is, well, about on par with what i can do.  That summoned hammer procs like a maniac (way more than my frosty).<br />
<br />
In an exp group she rarely has time to melee.  IF she's got extra mana she nukes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">landrain</div><div class="date">07-10-2003, 02:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Positioning is probably one of the most important jobs in a raid situation. It almost always falls upon the MT to do this.<br />
<br />
Sadly it is a lot like Aggro, We really have very little ways to do this. The MT will only very very rarely be able to actually move a raid quality mob. His job is mostly the facing, this we can affect.<br />
<br />
The moving of the mob is done by the raid force. Proximity aggro means a lot when main tanking, and you need to hug the mob, else the mob will aggro others. No amount of bash/kick/slam will ever compete with 30 people and pets pushing a mob, what you do control is which way the mob faces. It is the resposability of the raid to maintain max range, and balance, especially zerg-pets they do massive pushing. Stun-procs and KB spells also push more and with more reliability than we can ever expect.<br />
<br />
You need to train your raid to balance mobs, and follow the lead of the MT, Positioning is like dancing, you need to constantly work at it to look good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glatius2</div><div class="date">07-10-2003, 05:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is my two coppers, for what it's worth.<br />
<br />
First of all, yes it is the tank's job to work at positioning the mob in a group.  However, as a Warrior this isn't as easy as it first sounds.  Many times our aggro isn't strong enough to get the mob to follow us around like a lost puppy, particularly if pets are present.  So we'll back up, and the mob turns on the Monk.  Or we back up and the mob turns on the pet.  It's a serious pita.<br />
<br />
And consider, other melee move the mob as they attack, so eventually, even if the positioning started out perfect, it gets all screwy.  Rinse and repeat the problem above with the mob not necessarily following as we try to adjust.<br />
<br />
It is the job of all melee who aren't tanking to get behind the mob, particularly in PoP.  A riposte from a PoP mob just means more mana has to be used.  And it makes it much easier for the tank to stay in contact with the mob and position it most effectively when they don't have to compete with other melee chacters in the front.  I don't think I can even begin to explain how frustrating it is to be working your ass off trying to get the mob lined up so everyone has a clear shot at the back only to have someone in your way so you can't move in the direction you want/need to and to keep getting out of range messages as they move in front of you.  So even if the tank doesn't have the positioning exactly right, the other melee need to compensate.  It is after all a team effort.<br />
<br />
With regards to Clerics who like to melee, that's fine.  However, they need to behave like all other melee and attack from behind.  I have found that most Clerics, who are unfamiliar with melee in general to begin with, have a tendency to crowd the tank in front of the mob, just making my life and the life of other tanks more difficult.<br />
<br />
This is primarily from the point of veiw of group tanking.  Raids have other considerations as well.</div></div><hr />
