<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>daoga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I leveled my Ogre Warrior up to 45, then went back to my 24 cleric to level him up (they were on the same account)<br />
<br />
I have transfered the cleric to a new account, he is now 42 (dinged in kael at the bank last night, woot! :D )<br />
<br />
anyway, i already have some idea of where i will be going with them now, but i was wondering... i have some ideas for some hotkeys on the cleric to try and make my life easier, anyone have any suggestions of things to do? or even NOT to do?<br />
<br />
thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Twoaxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well some of the things I did while two boxing was<br />
<br />
1) Be sure to have a hotkey with /target Warrior's name on it.  Of course this is mainly for PLing as in your case they'll likely be grouped and it won't be such an issue.<br />
<br />
2) On my cleric I bought those right click Donal's vambraces.  You can stand and mana free chain heal for about 200hp every 9 seconds with little to no aggro.  Once again, not much help to you until your cleric hits 45th - but someone else might find the info handy.<br />
<br />
3) You're cleric doesn't have to have versatile healing spells up since you'll only be healing your war (assuming you don't group and two box).  In that case it leaves room for some utility spells such as nullify magic and more importantly - an extra stun slot.<br />
<br />
4) Root and atone are nice to have up as well.  If you get too many you can just park one out of aggro range and atone the bugger.<br />
<br />
5) If you've messed up and over pulled and find yourself in trouble.  Drop the warrior and make sure the cleric makes it out alive.<br />
<br />
6) Bring lots of vodka or Gnomish spirits etc...<br />
<br />
Well not much help really but perhaps someone will add to this useless list...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">mostly 2boxing is about macros. make yourself good ones and you are in biz. Especially so with cleric. Warrior / Cleric is the easiest 2box combo man can have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Keep those DAs up.  When my cleric gets aggro, I just DA and sit down and start beating on it with my warrior.  9 times out of 10  by the time DA wears off you will have aggro on the warrior.  I don't have a lot of macros, just my 3 heal spells I keep memmed (divine light, celestial healing, and complete heal).  I don't have a /target warrior hotkey, I just use F2.  When I'm 2-boxing in a group I insist on reforming the group, both so the warrior is in the usual F2 slot, and so the group is in the same order on both screens so I rarely have to look at the cleric's screen at all, just watch the health bars on the warrior screen and hit the appropriate F-key and the appropriate heal macro.  My heal macros go:<br />
<br />
/sit off<br />
/cast X<br />
/g Complete Healing %t<br />
/cast X<br />
/cast X<br />
<br />
The group message is very important because I don't look at the cleric screen, so if I start a heal on the wrong person I will see it on the warrior's screen.  The two extra /cast X lines are to make sure the spell gets off if you fizzle (this is horrible with celestial healing). <br />
<br />
My hotkeys go <br />
<br />
1-Complete Heal Macro<br />
2-Divine Light Macro<br />
3-Celestial Heal Macro<br />
4-Divine Aura<br />
5-/assist Brutul<br />
6-Snare neck<br />
7-Root<br />
8-Nuke<br />
9-Divine Barrier<br />
0-Gate<br />
<br />
As someone else said, 2-boxing alone with single-pulls a cleric is the easiest thing in the world to 2-box.  Playing both tank and cleric in a group can be pretty tricky though, since both warrior and cleric have important stuff they have to do right away if a multi-pull comes to camp and multiple people are getting beat on.  You can't really ignore either one, so sometimes you have to choose between healing someone, and trying to taunt off of them.  Takes some practice, and your group will most likely wipe out in situations they could have survived with a &quot;real&quot; cleric in group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lens314</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Number one thing to do, get a horse for the botted toon!!!  All the multiboxers I know swear by them for the mana regen.<br />
<br />
The saved spell sets are really helpful.<br />
<br />
Also, I have a USB keypad hooked up to the bots computer, right between the main toons keypad and main mouse, so the only thing i have to reach for is the ALT key for nukes, and other spells, and the SHIFT key to change hotkey banks<br />
<br />
I had practiced 2boxing the moats in KC, at about level 55 for my war, and my druid was at about 52 at the time, and moved on to the CYs later.   It was safe since I had succor, so not sure what you would do about that.    <br />
<br />
My druids hotkeys look like this nowadays:<br />
(Items in paranthesis are on the next hotkey bank)<br />
<br />
1. CH - /cast 1 * 3, /gsay CH inc on %t (Fast CHChain)<br />
2. Target Tanali - /targ tana * 3 (Slow CHChain)<br />
3. Assist Tanali - /targ tana * 3, /assist<br />
4. Follow Tanali - /targ tana * 3, /follow (Pet Attack)<br />
5. Velious bracer, free dot<br />
6. Chloroblast - /cast 2 * 3, /gsay Small heal on %t<br />
7. Leafblower, free dot<br />
8. Spirit of the Wood<br />
9. track(Radiant Cure)<br />
0. Sit(bridle)<br />
<br />
Yup, my bot gets thrown in the CH chains for my guilds raids more often than not nowadays, just using a faster pause value than the clerics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Good point Lens...the horse is invaluable.  Nothing worse than after 3 or 4 fights noticing that you are low on mana because you have been forgetting to sit after heals, and you don't really want /sit in your heal macro, because it raises your chances of getting aggro on the cleric if you sit immediately.  get a horse as soon as you can afford it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Friedrick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I would like to echo the horse/drogmar sentiment.  It really is the best thing you can have if you two box in outdoor zones.<br />
<br />
Most of the hotkeys look covered, but I would also suggest a /follow (warrior's name) one as well.  If you need to scoot from a bad pull, you dont want to be fiddleing with targeting and typing follow, make a macro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>daoga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thanks for all the advice, already have hotkeys for CH and HoT, follow (just follow, not specifically the warrior), sit/stand and my green ceremic band for faction hits.  I have been thinking about getting a leezard for the cleric, but not sure if i want to dump that much cash into it right now... would rather get some better gear for the warrior first... he has 2200+ hps unbuffed right now at 45.<br />
<br />
So far I have only grouped with guildmates, and they know i am two boxing it.  The shaman knows that I will not be healing the casters as fast, unless it is him getting beat on, so he covers the casters.  It has worked pretty well so far, and I have to attibute that more to the smooth way that my guildies operate (I can take some credit for that too though, I am guild leader)<br />
<br />
We went to GD and camped the giant fort near EW for a couple hours last night, no deaths, and only one close call on CH for the warrior, healed for 3020, warrior had 3032 hps total heh.<br />
<br />
Talk about mana efficient! ummm yeah...<br />
<br />
I think this will work for me, I am sure I will refine some of my hotkeys a little more, but last night my group told me that it was smoother working with my Warrior/Cleric combo than most groups with real people driving each one.<br />
<br />
it almost brought a tear to my eye when they said that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sshaithis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Nothing makes me happier than someone telling me I do a good job botting my toons.<br />
<br />
Hotkeys are your friend.<br />
<br />
Later on in your cleric's career, there should be more stuff you can add. I have 1 key to assist sshaithis, and throw a MoK and a MoR on the mob, I also have an /assist sshaithis and cast 6 which is nuke.<br />
<br />
Also have ornate legs for the free ~10dps pets that clerics have. (what they hay, it's like having a damage shield on!)<br />
<br />
I have to add (even though it's been said repetedly, it's that important) -- Get a mount! it's been the best 9k I've ever spent.<br />
<br />
Another thing, spell sets are great. I have several.<br />
<br />
1 - Group buff (no druid) - HoV, Zealot, BoR<br />
2 - Druid buff (for group symbol rather than HoV)<br />
3 - raid buff (no heals, all buffs - both single and group varieties)<br />
4 - exp grind (MoK, MoR, pacification, root, DA)<br />
5 - raid fight (DA, DB, MoR, 4 heals, group heal)</div></div><hr />
