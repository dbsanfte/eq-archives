<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kebast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm only 56 atm, but I was just wondering which of the attach discs were the most usefull?  I generally use Mighty Strike on Named mobs when I DW and Charge when I'm using a 2 hander...What's your most favorite? Or does it really depend on the situation and all are useful?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lens314</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Aggressive is the one I during the 1st half of a named mobs HPs when i am just DPS.  <br />
Fellstrike is the one i use when a quick burst of DPS is needed.<br />
<br />
I have not used Charge at all since Fellstrike and Agressive became availible, but I would imagine it could be put to some use.<br />
Mightystrike, in my book, is a toy unless your really desperate, and need to stun a baddie when you are berzerk with crippling blows.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I too have heard that Fellstrike is the most efficient in terms of DPS.  However, it lasts half as long as Aggressive.  For that reason, I usually use Aggressive in raid situations, where total damage matters more than brief DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jazun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've used Charge on stuborn mobs in exp groups but only when DW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kebast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks for the info..Charge, Mighty Strike and Furious are the only ones available to me now :) Looking forward to the rest.  What about Furious? Is it usefull at all?  Guess on non-slowable mobs it might be ok...what you think?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Use furious to save your own life whenever your healer's caught napping and you drop below 10% health.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I see, so you take no hits...guess riposte should have tipped me off :).<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Aggressive is teh suck now, unless they changed it back to 3 min.<br />
<br />
Fellstrike is the only DPS disc anyone should be using.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Well, that's an interesting statement.  I know fellstrike does better DPS while it runs, but it runs for half as long as aggressive.  I figured aggressive would do more total damage.<br />
<br />
e.g. hypothetical numbers:<br />
If you do 100 DPS normally, 140 DPS with aggressive, 180 DPS with fellstrike... then the two discs are a wash, unless the mob lives for less than a minute.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Frig Coldheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I use Fellstrike when off tanking on named or tough mobs just for some added DPS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, but I don't think those are the numbers tho.<br />
<br />
Fellstrike is serious, serious damage, especially with a decent ATK rating and a good 2h.  Aggressive has always seemed lame in comparison, and judging by the way people bitched when Aggressive was changed to 1 min, I'm certain that it's not outdamaging fellstrike in most situations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Bourbon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I smell a parse comin on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I used to use aggressive back when it lasted 3 mins and back when boss mobs lasted more than 3 mins too, but now all I use it fellstrike.  It is pretty much the only damage disc you need.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Binnamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I use mightystike because I like the eyecandy.<br />
<br />
But if it absolutely depends on warrior dps, then I'll fellstrike.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">There's no guesswork involved.  Aggressive is increase damage modifier by 30% for 1 minute.  This is, ignoring damage bonus, exactly 30% more DPS for 1 minute.<br />
<br />
Fellstrike is increase damage modifier by 100%, increase min damage modifier by 400%.  If we assume Aggressive is 30% DPS increased then certainly Fellstrike can't be less than 100% DPS increase (damage mod + min damage mod).  <br />
<br />
If you do X DPS, then you gain 30X DPS from Fellstrike, and 18X DPS from Aggressive.  Fellstrike will always win.  Just the damage mod alone from Fellstrike is more than 3 times that of aggresive even though it only lasts half as long, and it even has a min damage mod which aggressive does not have.<br />
<br />
As for mightystrike, a crit hit is about 1.7X normal damage, and a crippling blow is aroudn 2.5X normal damage.  If you're berserk, mightystrike will do more damage.  If not, fellstrike will do more damage.  It is fairly unlikely to stay berserk for 30 seconds though on anything where your DPS might matter.  Besides, Fellstrike leads to more impressive crits/crips.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Ayida</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Mightystrike is a decent dueling tool, when you are berserk and want to stun your opponent.<br />
<br />
Anywhere DPS matters I use Fellstrike.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Varalla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Depends on the situation.<br />
Routine, Ill use Fellstrike.<br />
<br />
Zerker Ill say &quot;Zerking no heal&quot; and MS, then &quot;Zerker off&quot; when done.<br />
<br />
If I dont know the healer, I never MS.<br />
They always heal just as ye hit the disc.<br />
It never fails.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Dima</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Fellstrike most of the time<br />
Mightystrike when I want to spam the raid with crits (and I equip bbote/mosstwig~)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Kebast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I normally am boxing a cleric so I know exactly when to pop the disc :).  Love those crippling blows LOL.  Thanks for the help all.</div></div><hr />
