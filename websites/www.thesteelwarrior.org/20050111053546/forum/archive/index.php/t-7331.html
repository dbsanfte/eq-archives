<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eriatha Egan</div><div class="date">05-26-2004, 09:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What's with some of the high end boss mobs that have their own unique model being bugged all to shit?  Right after the DX9 patch, we went after Fennin.  Instead of walking like he normally does (we've killed him before the patch, so we know what his model is supposed to be like), he now leans forward at an almost 45 degree angle and hops.<br />
<br />
Wtf?<br />
<br />
We finally got Seru last Friday night.  Grats me on my earring quest!  Seru looked like a 1980's robot dancer - stiff as a board.  I know he doesn't move like that.<br />
<br />
Wtf?<br />
<br />
For the first time, we engaged Xegony last night.  Instead of a smooth, floating model, she too was stiff as a board and hopping.  It's a goddamn faerie!  How can they hop?<br />
<br />
Wtf?<br />
<br />
And it's not just me seeing this.  It's my entire guild.  But seriously, what's up with some of these unique model boss mobs having funky animations?  It's been what, almost two months now?</div></div><hr />

ROFL!!<br />

Yea Seru looks like something out of South Park.  First time I saw him doing it I almost pissed my pants.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Payn</div><div class="date">05-27-2004, 01:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was in Howling Stones last night and the only mobs that acutally did their moving/fighting animation were blobs. The skeletons moved around like they wer eon conveyer belts and just stood like a statue as I attacked. They still hit me back, but it looked like I was carving away at a sculpture.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shirion</div><div class="date">05-27-2004, 02:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fennin looked hilarious yesterday, all arched over backwards.</div></div><hr />

<br />
also got Seru kept getting stuck in the wall and nobody could damage (was bad enough only a few people had bane weaps) so we waste mana/time as he gets stuck in the wall and everything from outside came in to aggro.... killed those and he finally popped back in.<br />
<br />
<br />
Did cursed aswell. Kicker wasn't being able to cornertank because I knew I wouldn't be able to due to earlier situations. but we had glyphed and runed up at the same time...split the two, killed glyphed, runed was still up... killed exiled, runed was still up.... killed cursed, runed was still up. So we killed runed, Banished spawned, killed banished and cursed spawned~ yay 6 drops in an hour and a half or so!    circle of smokex2, chain bp, leather bp, crystalized serpent eye and cloak of mourning.<br />

<br />
Why do they change things that aren't fuckin broken.... (like collision/corner-tanking)<br />
<br />
<br />
   Well enough bragging and bitching from me. Hopefully they fix this collision shit soon so I dont have to tank anymore mobs in the middle of rooms where people get to snag ripostes.</div></div><hr />
