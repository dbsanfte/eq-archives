Heh but seriously, anyone know why/what my guild and I are doing wrong? Mud ring bugged on us, named never popped. Dust ring bugged on us, named despawned while his adds stayed up..Stone ring the waves stopped popping after we knocked the 4 reds down, so they'd walk back?<br />
<br />
I'm normally not one to bitch and moan but PoEarth has nice drops and would be a good alternative from the fire/earth constant whack-a-mob game.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Mud ring, we kill all the blue mud guys in the area around the building, then we kill the 4 seekers. A sludge lurker pops above, we kill him - like 7 smaller muddites spawn, we kill those. Nothing happens, nothing spawns, so we head to water and clear ktm/gtw/offassa/hydro then back to earth to retry ring...<br />
<br />
We do the same thing, clear all the blues, then the yellows, then the red lurker. This time after we killed the muddlites that spawned from the lurker we had another lurker pop above. So we pulled him down started killing, then a yellow seeker respawned. The lurker died before the seeker, but after the lurker died same thing happened as before 7 muddite guys popped (we were guessing we would see another lurker up top because we got 2 lurkers this time) Well, nothing popped we cleared a bit more for awhile, got bored and left saying as nothing was happening.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyone able to clue me in on what we may be doing wrong? (and yes, it was comfirmed about 12 times that the mud ring was up and all the others, when we did them so we didn't get a PH at end)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kilzalot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">We went through them a while back backflagging some new members(and half the server) and the only problem we had was during the Peregrine ring.  We accidently killed one of the 4 guys that are supposed to walk back(gogo over-DPS)... we cleared the remaining rings and came back to that one and had np.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wolveren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Kill the Sludge Lurkers on an open, level area. Killing them next to the wall has a big chance of muddites dropping under the world. You saying there were only 7 of em suggests this happens cause it's at least a dozen that should spawn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Froggerx Xreggorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">2nd time we pulld the lurkers to zi and the same thing happened, 7 - 10 spawns or so?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bulbog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Eh why would you pull to the ZI?  That's a ridiculously long pull heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Froggerx Xreggorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">well we figured it was getting bugged with all of us up there along the wall sooo tried the alternative (pulling to zi)</div></div><hr />
