<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>tipoytm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi guys, I would just like to post this message to SoE to petition for a change in the graphic one of the weapons that I consider as a symbol of our class:<br />
<br />
Plane of Fire's &quot;Obsidian Battle Sword (http://allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=18257)&quot;   <br />

Dear SoE: <br />
I have camped this VERY RARE ultimate warrior sword for awhile now.  Finally I got it to drop last night, thanks to my prayers. This is my dream sword, and even though I am time flagged and will have good chances of getting better weapons.... still, I wanted this sword (with an obsession) and now I have it. Why? because I never did my epics for I knew if I did it (considering the huge timesink), I would never use it in combat, maybe just flash it around PoK. Now, this warrior pet sword I got from PoFire (as most of us elemental warriors know) procs a pet that looks exactly like the Warrior Epic 1hsx2, and the ratio of this sword is actuallly decent enough to make me use it now as a main battle weapon. It makes me wear it with pride, as I have come a long way into this game to reach the elementals, and to show how dedicated I am to my class for I have camped this sword for the longest time. :-) <br />
<br />
My only complain is this: The blade looks CHEAP. I have been doing a little research on what would be a deserving graphic for the Obsidian Battle Sword. I would humbly request SOE in behalf of some of the warriors in my server who wield it that the graphic be changed to the appearance of the Honorable Longsword that drops off the PoV dragon, AD. It will be perfect and rewarding.<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
If you don't know the graphic of the Honorable Longsword, well, it looks like SEWS, just make the blade shorter.   It looks exactly like the &quot;Sword of Primordial Power&quot; or &quot;Timespinner&quot;.<br />
<br />
So if you agree with me in this effort. please post in the thread: <br />
<br />
http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Warriors&amp;message.id=450 <br />
<br />
Just say something like &quot;I petition for a change of graphic and prefer the recommended new look.&quot; <br />
<br />
Thanks all.. please make us proud. :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shirion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Change the graphic on one thing, everyone will want everything changed. I do agree though, this deserves a better graphic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>DG-Slider</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think you should petition them to nerf the epics with a progressive Augment slot like the Wooden Talisman we use in the planes. That way, with each new expansion, our epic changes to keep up with us and doesn't become a nostalgic story of the good-old days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">epic weapons were never intended to be the endall weapons.<br />
<br />
nuff said</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>EmiliaEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">FUCK THAT CAMP<br />
<br />
0/23 named before i gave up.<br />
<br />
As for your request ... I dont think its even worth the effort.<br />
<br />
Sure it takes like 20 sec to do it. But hey ...<br />
Can i have BoW look like Gauralek plz ? K THX<br />
<br />
And if you say yes to 1 person .... you are doomed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>banchot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">help on how to camp this? where's the best camp/pull spot.  And do you need a full group for this? i can never get a group to come to island cuz they say the xp sucks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The xp is so-so, better than field 1, but that's not saying much.  I always cleared the one-hut island pulling to the zone wall, and then set up shop on the one-hut island and pulled the main island to there.  However, I bet it would be better to set up shop on the flat part of the main island when you're working on that island's mobs.<br />
<br />
I know of three spots where named jopals can spawn who drop the pet sword.  The single-hut island, and the 2nd-from-each-end huts on the main island.  There may be more that I haven't seen.<br />
<br />
I am 0 for many myself ... grats paladins on maces!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Crystara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I always sat down on the little safe spot on the main island and pulled to there, I think it took me about 6 named to have it drop, I ended up getting it off the named spider on the island full of them.  I was able to clear at least 4 PHs with the groups I had though, so it tends to take longer for most.  The camp is easy and it's a good source of fire parts for the gate neck quest if people still need them, the experience does indeed suck however.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gorlab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">How did you break the island where the spider spawns?  We were just calling that the island of death because of how many mobs were all clustered there.  We had a ranger using harmony to pull and it seemed to work on most everything except the mystics who resisted it about 80% of the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Crystara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">They almost always came single to an arrow from me, doubles rarely, never had a problem, just tag ones in the lava first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sassinak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">They all roam, so grab those that wander furthest away from their friends first. Also, certain kinds of mobs don't assist certain other kinds of mobs, you'll figure this out as you go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Best way to camp it IMO is just to pop in after a server reset and check for named.  There is usually at least one.  Of course this works better on Test because of frequent server resets.  <br />
<br />
I haven't camped it aggressively, but I have seen at least 3 or 4 paladin maces rot so far, along with a few that we got somebody to come and loot.</div></div><hr />
