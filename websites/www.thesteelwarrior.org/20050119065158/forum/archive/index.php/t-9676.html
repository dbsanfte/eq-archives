MPG would offer some excellent 1-group upgrades, as well as RS.  <br />
<br />
OoW quest armour (Armsmaster's) is a great route IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">oomwarrior</div><div class="date">11-12-2004, 03:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">thanx Puft I've been farming MPG abit.  in fact I've gotten the neck/ring/ear/mask already.  been trying to focus on AC gear so digging out the old trusty Doze armor to give my ac abit of kick since I hear AC &gt; 2000 is giving more bang for the buck then HP in MPG and up zones.  been eyeballing the tier2 oow quest armor and are working on factions atm but DAMN that faction is LOOOOONNNNGGGG  gotten to 70 and 30AA's in MPG and still not allied yet:D   I know you only need to get to high warmly but been too lazy to run to NC to check my faction:p  as far as rift, I have been staying away from it since I still get beat up pretty good in MPG with 1996 buffed AC and those 710 proc's REALLY add up when they get a lucky streak.  <br />
<br />
going back on my original question, are there any other 1 group solutions I should go after that would give me some noticable improvments? or i'm pretty much at the end of the road for a non-raider?</div></div><hr />
