<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I missed it, but apparently there were a couple GM's running rogues that would assasinate players for 400 plat.  A guildy of mine paid to have one of the guild rangers assasinated.   :p <br />
<br />
Anyway...we all got a big kick out of this event and I hope SoE does more stuff like this...it really adds a lot to the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lens314</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Rangers dont die enough? hehe</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well...that's why he chose that ranger...we made bets before starting a raid the night before about which ranger would die first...and the one he chose lived so he lost the bet... :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
We had one on FV last night too... had a GM decide it was time to raid FP and kill the warrior GM... The Cleric of the raid ( MH ) got a nice litle sword she couldn't use the guy with the kill shot got a NICE helm and the MT... he got a title... it was alot of fun and took a good hour or so of about 30 people beating him to kill the guildmaster...<br />
<br />
Was a blast :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>snarl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">this sounds like the kind of fun the GM's had 4 years ago when we didn't have to worry about upsetting newbies... wish i was at that FP raid... that would have been fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dobbanz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Did they give people the option of defending the guildmaster? That might have been even cooler if you had to fight off players as well as npcs. But then, that might have just turned into a big mess. Still, that sounded like it was a really fun event. What was the mt's title? Better than a guildmaster?<br />

Wouldn't it make more sense to like buff up Lucan and have him killed? He's the person that is &quot;enslaving&quot; Freeport.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gerick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Notice they pick on the warrior grand master, and notice that there is a pally on every EQ game cover....<br />
<br />
they are out to get us :looks around</div></div><hr />
