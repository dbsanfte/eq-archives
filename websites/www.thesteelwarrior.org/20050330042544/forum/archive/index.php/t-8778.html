<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Timmok</div><div class="date">09-05-2004, 05:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its been a while since I actually bothered parsing our guild DPS, but since a bunch of our rogues recently acquired Tacvi+Txevu daggers, I have started doing some parses again. And the results did surprise me a bit.<br />
<br />
I was expecting wizards to be #1, and then rogues, and then ranger and then monks. However as it turns out, our rogues are destroying everyone else in DPS. Its pretty darn sick what those 23 and 25 dam daggers put out. Here are some random samples:<br />
<br />
Pixtt Xxeric Kex(Elapsed time: 422 seconds)<br />
Mitnick - Rogue - 113493 damage -  269 DPS (tacvi dagger)<br />
Fureur - Rogue - 111608 damage -  264 DPS (tacvi dagger)<br />
Celsius - Magician - 95530 damage -  226 DPS (pet dps included)<br />
Zwickel - Rogue - 85533 damage -  203 DPS (txevu dagger)<br />

Kalafandras - Wizard - 71070 damage -  168 DPS<br />
<br />
Zun`Muram Yihst Vor(Elapsed Time: 297 seconds)<br />

Rayo - Monk - 48109 damage -  264 DPS<br />
Jander - Ranger - 45252 damage -  249 DPS<br />
<br />
And finally the last one that made all our rangers cry and talking about rerolling as rogues :p<br />
<br />
Mnat M`sha (Elapsed time: 123 seconds)<br />
<br />
Mitnick - Rogue - 83950 damage -  683 DPS (!!!) Discs+Bard+FA+Fero.. but still very very sick<br />
Fureur - Rogue - 66275 damage -  539 DPS<br />
Thunderbird - Wizard - 57746 damage -  469 DPS<br />
Nomics - Magician - 48346 damage -  393 DPS (including pet damage)<br />
Gyldendahl - Wizard - 47540 damage -  387 DPS<br />
Goliano - Wizard - 44847 damage -  365 DPS<br />
Rayo - Monk - 40496 damage -  329 DPS (inktuta 2hander)<br />
Celsius - Magician - 37512 damage -  305 DPS<br />
Zorrbald - Monk - 36278 damage -  295 DPS<br />
Karde - Monk - 35608 damage -  289 DPS<br />
<br />
The same kind of results basically carry over to Tacvi. Apparently resists there is putting a pretty big dampener on wizard DPS. What surprised me the most is probably the monk DPS, its decently high(although still nowhere near rogues). Cyno wraps+Sinai seems to be pulling of a steady 300 DPS, and the inktuta 2hander can peak a little bit higher.<br />
<br />
Ranger DPS on the other hand, seems to be rather crappy. <br />
IMO something is wrong when a #2 eqrankings ranger serverwide score LESS dps when using trueshot(with HP Bakari bow), <br />
than what our Tacvi dagger rogues can pull of sustained, without using disc.<br />
<br />
SOE need to be very carefull about what they give rogues in OoW, because atm it seems they are already way ahead of other classes in the damage department, so much so that its kinda pointless to recruit something like.. say rangers or SKs, when you can just fill up with rogues. Its not like its difficult to gear them up either, there is basically an endless supply of<br />
22 damage daggers you can trigger at will in Inktuta, and the bone spike from Txevu seem pretty common as well.<br />
<br />
Anyone else seeing similar results, or have parses they want to share?</div></div><hr />

But he have 55 more innate ATK, savage guard clicker and 1 more +20 backstab mod, compared to our other rogue with the tacvi dagger(Fureur), so that might explain some of the gap.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It has been this way since the end of pop ( if the guild has done LDoN raids ).<br />
And these dps doesn't surprise me at all, wizard burst dps has been gimped ( due to several things ) and SoE listens to the &quot;melees&quot; that they need more dps to &quot;catch&quot; back casters *cough*.<br />
This trend will continue in OOW and I bet it will be even worse.<br />
If you look at the highest damage from expension to expension on a rogue percier : <br />
original 13/30, kunark 15/25, velious 15/19, luclin 16/20, PoP 20/19, god : 25/21, my feeling it's that for OOW there will be a 1hp with 30dam/20del yeah !<br />
SoE are totally clueless about balancing as the majority of their player base.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Timmok</div><div class="date">09-05-2004, 06:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well warrior DPS on bosses is basically crap. Usually lucky if one even makes the top 20 dps list. Also alot of the times we cant really keep attack on 100% of the time(unless you swap to non-agro weapons), so that limits our dps further.<br />
<br />
But anyway, when we fool around with Qvic minis and if someone else is tanking, I typically parse between 240 and 300 DPS from the back if I use fellstrike and if the fight is 3 mins long. The highest I have ever parsed on qvic mini was 307 DPS. That was using fellstrike+brutish blade of balance+demerix painsipper, and I think I might have had a bard with me for overhaste.<br />
<br />
Sustained dps on qvic minis with that weapon combo and no discs seem to be about 200ish.</div></div><hr />

Results vary greatly. Of note, vs. Aneuks in Txevu, wizards always destroy everyone. M`Shas/Cynosure in Qvic, rogues always come out on top. If Ixts in Txevu AE rampage, rogues do terribly... if flurry or single target rampage, rogues on top.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh and Timmok, I couldn't agree more about the fact that rogues are getting a little to much power. ( Yes a Tacvi guild rogue said it ) <br />
<br />
Our guild now regularily fields 6-10 rogues in txevu and 5-8 rogues in tacvi. In txevu the extra bulk is rogue alts there just for extra dps. But in tacvi its almost purely member rogues. The only class that outnumbers us rogues in tacvi is , of course, clerics... and we all know about the unbalanced nature of clerics in EQ. <br />
<br />
What is unfortunate is that we field 0 - 2 of the following: sk,necro,beast,mage and berserker.<br />
<br />
But from your parses I must say props to the mages! Combined pet/mage dps should be right up there with rogues as this is what mages do. They dont get alot of utility spells really. other than gate their accoutrement is pretty much damage or summoning something that does damage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am quite sure you are not 'racist' against classes, so the reason you have few to none of those classes, is because they are quite underpowered and not as useful.<br />
<br />
If you were to min / max a roster for a high end guild, you'd have 40% of raid as clerics,  5 or 6 warriors, 1 pal, 1 rng, 1 magician, a few bards, maybe two shamans, 1 druid (who needs back up healers with that many druids) some wizards, lots of rogues.</div></div><hr />

Our berserker is the number one serverwide and he does excellent dmg. Wed love to have necros but alas there are none. We had to beg like crazy to find mages during the keledrix learning. SK's.... We have the number one SK serverwide and well he does his share but theres not much use for them. And monks- we use bard pullers mainly. Monks are useful in txevu for pulling but aside from that they are fodder DPS and not the best at that. <br />
<br />
SK/monk maybe under powered but the rest of those classes are fine. The supply of hardcore players is simply down on our server.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Despite what many people think, rogue damage is highly dependant upon the skill of the player.  I have many many parses where I've done 50% to nearly 3 times the damage of other guild rogues using similar weapons. However, I'm sure it's a combination of several factors besides difference in skill... such as lack of attention, afk, poor hotkey setups, etc.</div></div><hr />

Grabbit, even assuming that particular rogue was an incredible player, it is a fair assumption that the other players were great players as well.<br />

<br />
I chose accuracy for my gear, I have 66 worn accuracy and Fureur has like 8. I have Tacvi dagger augmented with eye of the onyx guardian and Fureur has Tacvi dagger + Ikkinz 4 augment. Zwickel use the Txevu dagger. Instead of accusing people of cheating, start by looking at players magelo. Either 683dps was certainly a very lucky disc.<br />

Yea, MQ plays a rog better than any real rogue can.  I hate the fact that that program exists and is so widely used.  I'm not saying that Mitnick was using it, but I know that a lot of rogs do and that it works extremely well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">09-08-2004, 12:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Unfortunately for wizards, resists have severely gimped their possible output. These parses would be very different if wizards could cast  Ancient Strike of Chaos (3288 base damage). Instead, they are forced to cast  Agnarr's Thunder (2305 base damage) because fire doesn't land on shit in GoD. Assuming that fire resist rates are balanced in OoW I would expect wizards to compete a lot better with rogues, particularly in fights that last less than a mana bar.</div></div><hr />

Ok!  Hookt hon foniks werks 4 me!<br />

I fail to see how you could find something offensive when I never accused you of anything.  I said it was a possibility.  And clearly, you don't even know what MQ does, as it's more than just &quot;keeping one hotkey down&quot;.  Or are you just covering up the fact that you use it IRL???two?<br />

It would be nice to see some of the magelos though, to compare and contrast.</div></div><hr />

If it was the truth, guilds would be using boted rogues since a long time. I have never met a rogue bot.<br />

I know a rogue who macro his backstab and evade, I suspect even the movement. But all the times I grouped with him, I outdpsed him by far.<br />

English isn't my native language, but for me it looks you imply it's more than a possibility at the end of your post.<br />

On a side note, yes I am defensive because I am recruiting with Raging Fury and you imply I cheat. If it's not your intention, I apologize, but it sure look that way for me.<br />

Ever seen somebody use stick?  No way a human can stay on a mob's back like that.  Do you always hit your backstab key within a few microseconds of it popping up?  MQ does.  Trust me, there are bot rogs out there, and nobody out-dps's them.  You won't hear people talking about it, because their account will get banned if they're caught (supposedly).  Not a knock on anyone's skill, it's just not possible for a human to react as quickly as the computer can to a button popping up or a mob moving.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do you feel the DPS gap shown in the parses is balanced?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Do I think the parses are balanced?  That's a tough question.  It's a handful of parses, on a few select mobs, with very little information.  There are too many factors, too many intangibles, and too many variables to make an educated determination if the parses are &quot;balanced&quot;.  <br />
<br />
One thing I will say is that the M'sha's are not good mobs to use when making dps comparisons.  Rogues always tend to put up some inflated numbers due to their lower avoidance/mitigation.  <br />
<br />
An obvious trend that you'll notice is that as fight duration went down, dps went up.  The last parse is just over 2 minutes..a rogue can stay under discipline for half of that (using deadeye, and duelist back to back). So, obviously fight duration is going to be a significant factor in the totals.  While not nearly as significant to rogues as it is to wizards, it's still very relevant, and at least partially explains the astronomical figures in a couple of the parses.<br />
<br />
Backstab damage has gotten to the point where a good disc can inflate your numbers to jaw dropping proportions, BUT it's not nearly as common place as some would like you to believe.  I've had discs where I've put up an additional 15k in backstab damage and then some where I struggled to break 2k.  It's very very streaky, and has a tremendous affect on your numbers. <br />
<br />
A very skilled rogue, with bleeding edge weaponry, and equipment selected for the sole purpose of increasing his/her damage is going to put up some sick numbers.  However, as so clearly shown by the parses the damage output from one rogue to another varies pretty widely.  <br />
<br />
<br />
I realize I haven't really answered your question, but I don't feel that I can without being biased one way or the other due to the lack of info..  If I had all of the data , I might take a stab at it.<br />
<br />

P.S. I've never used MQ, but I'm curious.....does it have a feature that allows you to automatically stay behind a mob?  If it doesn't, how it rivals someone actually playing is beyond me, but then again I don't know jack about the program.</div></div><hr />

Yes it does.  It's called &quot;stick&quot; and I haven't personally observed somebody doing it, but from what I hear it works extremely well.</div></div><hr />

Our rogues dont have tacvi or Txevu daggers though and was probably not superbuffed to get the highest dps possible. But anyway<br />
<br />
Dvoin Msha (160 sec duration)<br />
Wizard - 67550 damage - 435.81 dps<br />
Wizard - 57476 damage - 422.62 dps (lower total damage cause he was only active for 2 min 16 sec it seems instead of 2 mins 40)<br />
Rogue - 62520 damage - 393.21 dps<br />
Rogue - 41721 damage - 313.69 dps<br />
after that a couple mages show up on dps ranking, but low total dam cause they didnt nuke the who fight or something<br />
<br />
Ptav Msha (145 sec duration)<br />
Wizard - 54055 damage - 415.81 dps<br />
Wizard - 50374 damage - 367.69 dps<br />
Magician - 41697 damage - 299.98 dps<br />
Rogue - 40926 damage - 292.33 dps<br />
and then 3 rogues on the next spots<br />
<br />
I wont pretend to be an expert on parsing or anything, but atleast it seems to me that wizards *can* do decent dps (400+ on both) on these mobs<br />
<br />
Warriors were around 160-180 dps btw hehe</div></div><hr />

<br />
So today on Xxeric the wizards noted they had ALOT less resists, since we threw every debuff in the book on Xxeric, which apparently was not done the last time. <br />
<br />
Here is the top 20 from tonight:<br />
<br />
Pixtt Xxeric Kex(Elapsed time: 308 seconds)<br />
1. Thunderbird - Wizard - 120990 damage -  393 DPS'<br />
2. Mitnick - Rogue - 114899 damage -  373 DPS'<br />
3. Frezzer - Wizard - 114878 damage -  373 DPS'<br />
4. Kalafandras - Wizard - 108884 damage -  354 DPS'<br />
5. Zwickel - Rogue - 106655 damage -  346 DPS'<br />
6. Prochuvi - Magician - 90365 damage -  293 DPS'<br />
7. Nomics - Magician - 81011 damage -  263 DPS'<br />
8. Nissen - Magician - 78310 damage -  254 DPS'<br />
9. Celsius - Magician - 72081 damage -  234 DPS'<br />
10. Faiar - Wizard - 64106 damage -  208 DPS (&lt;- SS'ing until 30%)<br />
11. Zorrbald - Monk - 61718 damage -  200 DPS'<br />
12. Rayo - Monk - 57832 damage -  188 DPS'<br />
13. Einon - Enchanter - 52741 damage -  171 DPS'<br />
14. Twink - Shadow Knight - 52601 damage -  171 DPS'<br />
15. Ztroke - Rogue - 51620 damage -  168 DPS'<br />

18. Heino - Monk - 48115 damage -  156 DPS'<br />
19. Aknon - Beastlord - 47020 damage -  153 DPS'<br />
20. Mordeous - Beastlord - 39751 damage -  129 DPS'<br />
<br />
As you can see we finished fight in 308 seconds as opposed to 422 seconds last time.. a full 2 mins faster. <br />
<br />
So lesson learned is debuffs makes a huge difference(and some people slack if you dont keep the whip over them /poke debuffers :p)<br />
<br />
Oh and i am guessing the reason some of the melees scored low in this one, is that we were very low on healers, so basically had none to spare for the rogues/monks etc, so I am assuming they scored a bit lower since they probably had to run out from time to time(rampage damage) or whatever.</div></div><hr />

If he's THAT far ahead, it would seem that he's PERFECT, which is pretty much only something that MQ can do.<br />
<br />
Thats not true.  Ive known a couple of MQ rogues in my day and a MQ rogue doesnt track the back as well as a human + gamepad.  What i do is use gamepad to backstab and evade for me then handle movements myself.   If you watch me follow the back of a mob and a MQ rogue follow the back of the mob im always ahead cause i predict.  MQ always seems to be catching up and not all that efficiently. Tthe worst is when a MQ bot is following the back of a mob that has flipped.  Its just painfully obvious and somewhat slow.  The bot runs out to the perfect arc.  A fast player would just get enough to backstab.  REaction time doesnt matter as much as efficient positioning. We both backstab just as often.  <br />
<br />
Further I never apologized to anyone for using an autofire device and dont care who petitioned me.   Gamepad is legal~<br />
<br />
Anyway gamepad greater damage or equal to MQ for players that are attentive.  So you dont know really.  Just cause someone never misses a backstab doesnt mean they are using a memory hack.  They might just be using an autofire device.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The rogue Macro:<br />
<br />
Autofollows any target.<br />
Engages at a set percentage.<br />
Runs Hide/Sneak whenever not attacking.<br />
ALWAYS faces the back of mob.  There is no arc ran, the rogue in question is *immediately* positioned behind the mob, and *never* misses a backstab.<br />
Uses /disc nimble if aggro is gotten<br />
And you can have them evade every time it's up.<br />
<br />
I know rogues that macro all the time, they don't even play when they xp simply because there is no need to, they'll just comes back for commercial breaks =)  If you know what you're looking for, you can usually spot a MQ'er right away.<br />
<br />
You guys might also want to check out the warrior one, it always stays in front of the mob, and turns attack off on enrage, and mash's kick/taunt =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">qutsemnie</div><div class="date">09-08-2004, 10:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Im pretty sure my favorite AE healer for long term AE encounters like uqua was using macroquest.  ITs either that or he was one attentive bastard over the weeks he never failed to top me off after every single ae ONCE.  Never.  I mean never did this guy just let some damage go figuring he would catch it later.  Always topped everyone off after every mob.  <br />
<br />
Wizards?  You dont think the other classes on that list can use macroquest?  You think a wizards situation is more complicated then moving a rogue around to follow a back?  Not really~  <br />
<br />
So really if every class on that list can use macroquest and rogues further can get the same results by using an autofire devices what exactly is your point in making it important in a class balance discussion?<br />
<br />
My point is that its not relevant.  A rogue using human movements and a gamepad to backstab and evade is just as efficient and all the other classes on that list could have been using MQ themselves.<br />
<br />
BTW a gamepad can be programmed to push two buttons at once on different time intervals and since both backstab and evade go off of time and arnt buffable beyond 100% haste thats just as good as &quot;always evading&quot;<br />
<br />
BTW I would like to see macroquest nerfed too.  The only thing that will get it is client side scanning.  Client side scanning is the only reliable anticheat method known.  I just dont see why this thread was about macroquest when every class on that list could have been using it.  And it doesnt do all that much for rogues with a gamepad.<br />
<br />
And also if I had a final point it would be this:<br />
____________________________________________<br />
<br />
It sounded like your argument was basically<br />
&quot;If macroquest is bad rogues must be nerfed&quot;<br />
<br />
Just cause you linked the issue of balance to MQ.  If thats not your argument then thats fine.  However I had to call it out because it channels peoples negative feelings about macro'n in general to an unhealthy look at what damages were done.  Thats a red herring.  Its completely unrelated to the facts about how much damage is done.  And that review needs to be done objectively.<br />
<br />
Any class can macro its bad but it doesnt alter the facts of what the class can do.<br />

The Tacvi fights are a bit too long for wizard to really shine, and at the same time, some of them have ramp/ae/etc to keep rogues from being way ahead either.<br />
<br />
But the real issue I see (heh) is that wizards (all casters do) need shitload of resist debuffs to be able to perform, while rogues don't and rogues need positioning, which wizards don't. Then again, as we are speaking of GoD, I have yet to see a mob which can't be positioned, especially when so many of them are rooted for melee dps conveniency and their AEs are tuned for caster dps conveniency :D<br />
<br />
In the end of the day though, it looks pretty equal play ground for dps classes.<br />

People complained about having spy software and the implications it had so verant ( was still verant then ) removed it. <br />
<br />
<br />
..and I have to agree with Grabbit, rogue dps is highly dependent on the skill of the rogue. Little things like &quot;Not Going AFK&quot; might seem like obvious choices for a rogue but you'd be suprised. Also skill in predicting mob turns , push , and general tenacity of the attack.  As a rogue do you sit out when a mob is AE rampaging? Do you run in here and there to get any dps possible? Do you nimble or turn off attack when bosses enrage? How fast are you at escape/nimble when you get aggro? Do you play eq like Quake, constantly in mouse look strafing for the best positions? All these factors weigh in on the damage a rogue does in high end fights. <br />
<br />
 There are also some uncontrollable items a rogue has towards his dps. Against your run of the mill boss, rogues do not need that much healing. A smart gaggle of rogues can chill in a group with a druid and be just fine. But once you get into the world of highly unresistable harsh ae's or ae rampage bosses then rogues become a serious source of melee damage. This always causes problems for raid leaders because in this day and age of eq and the CH rot  + spammers , its nearly impossible to spare YET another cleric. <br />
<br />
Of course this leads to the tangent subject...that clerics fill the role of CH rot , spam heal, and group heal. Now if that isn't a clear example of unbalanced classing, I do not know what is.  :confused:</div></div><hr />

With the right weapon where you can stay glued on the mob without pulling agro and o disc it can be pretty impressive.  Ive found the lodestar to be a great weapon for this, can usually get in top 10 in DPS on boss mobs at raids at roughly 200 dps in about 5-7 mins of fighting.  <br />

Its always fun to play a different role as a warrior once in a while and put out as much damage as you can  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that a rogue's (or any other melee's dps) is highly dependent on the buffs he or she gets from others. What kind of dps do you think they could can get without haste or attack buffs?<br />
<br />
Point is, all classes are supposed to depend on each other to some degree, particularly in raids. That's the way the game is supposed to be played. Using teamwork. Rogues and other melees need buffs. Wizards and other casters need debuffs.</div></div><hr />

The biggest difference I see from caster point of view is that for example haste, atk, etc. buffs last 30-120 minutes, while the 3 different bard debuffs do not :) Sure bard melee songs help rogues too, but do they make the difference between 150dps and 450dps?</div></div><hr />

In a lot of situations a rog just playing can match a MQ rog in dps, but won't often beat them.  The difference is that MQ is always on and any real player will be sending a tell or watching TV or tabbed out flaming people on TSW some of the time.  I don't believe MQ has anything to do with the difference between bards and wizards, and any class can be macroed on a raid except jobs that take a lot of reaction to unpredictable events.  Can't macro a puller I don't think, and it probably wouldn't be a good idea on things like your main tank on a fight where the mob can get pushed around but most classes can be played my MQ as well or better than a real player in most situations.  <br />

<br />
I would lean to unwilling at the current time.  Since mq 2 is so easy to use and readily available its abuse is fairly out of hand.  I would say at least 10-20% of high end players use this, and upwards of 50% use either mq or show eq.  Its at the point where youre at a disadvantage if you dont use the software, especially on a pvp server.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually no. But here is why I say that. <br />
<br />
I am aware it can twist songs endlessly. When you try and twist 4 with a macro ( I own a nostromo 52 ) you get whats called the &quot;start song,stop song bug&quot;. When when a song starts at the same time as it ends, it actually doesnt start. So you have to reduce the twist to 3. This has been a very very long standing bug.<br />
<br />
Then you have the fact you can not stop a macro instantly with MQ like you can on the nostromo. Its a huge selling point of the N52. So if a bard has to stop singing or change songs, he is fucked.<br />
<br />
MQ is good for bards who are raid bots and kite bots. I used the macro feature on my pad for all of 5 minutes before I realised it blew ass and would never be better than a &quot;manual&quot; twist. It simply make you a shitty bard who is not able to react on a moments notice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
  You mean, you chain press taunt? Because that's been established as a terrible, terrible way to play a warrior. It doesn't give any sort of aggro advantage, and in most cases hurts your ability by not having taunt available when you need it.</div></div><hr />

One thing to note is the high scoring warrior is (generally) one with a chaotic black scimitar who also deliberately maximises DPS - he asks for ATK buffs that the monks dont bother with, and so on.

For further reference, I have about 7 M'Sha fights where I meleed only from behind and didnt have to heal, etc. They last about 7-8 minutes as we do them with low numbers and I score consistently 210-216 dps, so I would say they're pretty good parse mobs, if not for the fact they're totally fireproof ;)<br />

Also, SK's aren't really underpowered when it comes to pulls, they have quite a few advantages to be perfectly honest (non LoS pulling, 400 range pulling, snare, instant invis, pseudo-escape, invul, horses, the ability to take a beating, etc...).</div></div><hr />

Those dps numbers are a good real world comparisons showing what each class puts out comparativly in each specific situation, but anyone who has fought those mobs would prob agree that they are not the best parse mobs around.   Thanks for puting this up Timmok, nice to see hard numbers on end mobs.</div></div><hr />

Since mq 2 is so easy to use and readily available its abuse is fairly out of hand.  I would say at least 10-20% of high end players use this, and upwards of 50% use either mq or show eq.  Its at the point where youre at a disadvantage if you dont use the software, especially on a pvp server.<br />
<br />
aye but for the folks on the pvp servers software like show eq can be the one and only thing that gives them the edge (a small one at that) over players that a fortunate enough to be in the top guild on the server like pdm for example (wink wink).....not to say that makes it right but when someone is desprate and limited on gear thats what happens..../shrug</div></div><hr />

i was lookin thorugh  old parses and for 3:16 fight i did 85,042 (433.89) so i dont think rogues are really that far ahead. and im using a 35% dmg focus too and no focus flappy or song or max level prolonged devastation(it was down) /shrug. its just what caliber of each class are u throwing at your rogues in comparison. are the classes compared to the rogues the same level of gear? or skill for that matter.</div></div><hr />

Oow aa's are a bit different, when this post was originally done Oow wasn't released yet.  Should check your dates. Which mob did you parse this on? Generally in oow our rogues come out on top for dmg' dealers over wizards.  Every class has their mob  they are more in favor of.  It's hard on wizards anymore given the amount of resisted nukes they get, in the prolonged trials (specialization) for instance, its hard to keep up sustained dps for how long the trial is.</div></div><hr />
