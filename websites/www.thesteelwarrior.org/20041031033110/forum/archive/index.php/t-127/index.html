<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone have some info on this? <br />
It seems you need to get to the 4th ring and beyond (how many are there?) to get any loot, and that the first 3 can just be done by one group for EXP.<br />
<br />
How hard are he 4th+ rings? What kind of raid force is needed to get to the good loot? What levels? Etc...<br />
<br />
Any help or info is appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>-Kai-</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">From my experience...its all random....any boss can pop at any time...skellis will continue to spawn and more than one boss can spawn at once.  Key is keeping skellis dead and killing bosses fast enough not to get 2 at once(tricky).  If you ask me its broken...not a fan of this Ring :( <br />
<br />
As far as numbers...40-50 people from Level 55-65.<br />
<br />
Little info to get you by....make sure clerics stay inside ring circle (ring will stop and everything will despawn if you leave the ring). Have about 6 good tanks jump mobs as they spawn have a MA calling targets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">does the ring stop if anyone leaves or if everyone leaves?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tarlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">it doesnt immediately end, but starts a &quot;timer&quot; if nobody is in the ring. after 15-25 secs mobs start despawning, assuming they aren't aggro on anyone.<br />
<br />
contrary to popular belief, you can always add more people as the event goes on. the grimling warder that's blocking the exit can be bypassed with bard da.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">40-50 would be kinda crowded in that room I think.  It's just 3 skeletons every couple minutes.  The three are pretty easy to keep down, the only time it gets iffy is when a boss spawns because they have a ton of hps  and while you're killing them you get lots of waves of skels spawning.  Best way to deal with this is to have a few wizards that keep themselves near full mana during the waves and then go into AE mode when a boss spawns and you start getting behind.<br />
<br />
Make sure you have like 2 or 3 enchanters and as many AE casters as you can get, +3 tanks and enough clerics to do a small CH chain on the bosses plus keep the AE people alive.  <br />
<br />
Last time we did it we kept it going for like 3 hours and finally had to quit because our last enchanter had to go.  If everybody steps out of the ring it will stop and the mobs will despawn in a few seconds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>chongo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hrm.<br />
<br />
I thought the more people you put IN the ring, the more Rings you start.<br />
<br />
example: only 1 person in the ring = 1 ring. put 3 people in the ring, 3 rings start.<br />
<br />
Or am I mistaken?<br />
<br />
Other than that, it's a really fun event. At least, I had fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>arative</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">keep the casters/healers in the ring, the melee have them outside the ring.<br />
<br />
Generally, 3 mobs will spawn and rush the center of the room, they all spawn in the same spot each time. the boss spawns towards the door. If I recall correctly, the boss you get is totally random, one with the good loot could pop first, last or never. <br />
<br />
Personally I think its a waste of time to do it, its long and boring and you can never be sure if you will get the good pay off, ie the chain bp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Slashurr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It's a blast, just make sure you have some good enchantsers AE stunning and as many nukers as you can muster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Binnamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It's a blast the first 15-25 mins, after that it just drags, and drags, and drags, and drags, and drags, and drags.. sorry... hehe you get the point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>kuuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">borken on tt thanks verant</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Brolie Paragus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">i heard some odd stuff to that confused me about this event like if you get beaten up reall bad and wanna end the event  you cant and theres no way to unspawn the warders so you can bring in a group to rez on event of a t.w.o.  untill the event resets wich is 24 hrs ... having never done this and what little info is out there can somone please dispell the roumers? because i really cant believe half the crap i hear about the bugs in this event...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Don't know where you heard that hehe, everything despawns a couple minutes after you end the ring.  If things are going bad just tell everyone to get out of the ring and you can stop and reset, med up, and go back in.  Don't do it while a boss is up though or it will poof too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Brolie Paragus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">cool the things i heard were from people on my server (mostly people who dont know much to begin with but thos who know wont tell because of thier stingy strat holding)  and from piecing things together from allahs and illias and here and there info i gathered its probably why it confused me soo much...</div></div><hr />
