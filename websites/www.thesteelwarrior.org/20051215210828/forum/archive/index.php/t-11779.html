<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trivan</div><div class="date">05-26-2005, 08:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi I was wondering if anyone have tryed a &quot;Dark Iron Pulverizer&quot; ? I was wondering to get my hands on one, decent dps at lvl 50, nice max dmg for instant attacks, and a VERY evil 8 sec stun proc ! question is now... how much does it proc - anyone every had one, and used it for a longer time ?<br />
<br />
I an looking for a weapon which can take me to lvl 58+ where I can use / buy some of the REALY nice weapons, &quot;Hammer of Titans&quot;, &quot;A-Reaper&quot; etc.<br />
<br />
I am useing &quot;Sword of the Titans&quot; now, so was planning on getting the &quot;Dark Iron Pulverizer&quot; now (I am lvl 51), but if the proc rate is to slow, I might keep my Sword and go for &quot;Twig of the World Tree&quot; once I hit lvl 53 - the Twig have some very nice stats bonus, and a bit better dps that the &quot;Pulverizer&quot;<br />
<br />
Anybody else have a weapon I should be looking for at lvl 51-52, which I can use until I get one the realy nice weapons at 58+ ?<br />
<br />
Thx in advance<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greysen</div><div class="date">05-26-2005, 11:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've seen posts putting the proc rate on this at less than 1%.  Whether that is true or not, is hard to say as a lot of offecal forum posts are just that.<br />
<br />
What I do know is that by the time you get the dark iron to get this weapon made, you could've easy had enough arcanite, as well as the level/experience to use arcanite grade weaponry.   Simply put, unless you do nothing but farm dark iron, don't expect to get this anytime soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trivan</div><div class="date">05-27-2005, 04:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I realy hope its not 1% or less, that would be the same as no proc at all with a slow weapon as this - but still 8 sec stun is evil, so I am not expecting a crazy high proc rate.<br />
<br />
About the Dark Iron - I am not a miner, so I am buying all the Dark Iron, and here at 51 I almost have all it takes, so can use it at lvl 51-58, and start saving the 500 gold for the Reaper or Hammer of Titans I realy want !<br />
<br />
<br />
btw I see now that I might have booked this on the wrong forum - I am sorry - maybe someone can move it for me `?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baldae</div><div class="date">08-16-2005, 10:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can confirm that the proc on this weapon is more of a &quot;oh, what a nice surprise&quot; then something I can count on a regular basis. That said, when I was deuling outside of IF last night I had 2 stuns in about 8-10 matches, 3 of those matches lasted over 2 minutes. I also had 2 stuns over an hour-long BG match the same night... it's nothing I'd count on in a 1v1 matchup. The damage on this weapon however is awesome, when Seal of Command procs the damage can be upwards over 800, that combined with regular weapon damage my total 1-hit damage becomes 1k+ - regular hits are around 250 with 350 crits. By far the best weapon for a L50 melee weapon user that I've found. So far I outdamaged a Kang-using warrior and another warrior using the Princess Theradras Scepter.</div></div><hr />
