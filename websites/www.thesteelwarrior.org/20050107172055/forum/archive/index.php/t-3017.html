<br />
Anger has to be better aggro than ykesha.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vigdis SangCaru</div><div class="date">09-12-2003, 03:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I suspect that the agro from these two separate proc lines are just about even in points.  So Anger III is probably the equivalent of Force of Ykesha - both being 720 points.  <br />
<br />
I still don't know what to make of Wrath of Ykesha.  An additional 390 points seems awfully steep for an additional 25DD.  But since we still haven't figured out the procing rates, maybe that has something to do with the price.  <br />
<br />
I'm torn.  I'm definitely going to buy AngerIII for one of my weapons, but I have a while before I augment b/c I'm not going to augment either of my current weapons.  I think that once I have an EB weapon setup, that additional 300 hate, making a total of a whopping 1k hate, will be well worth it. <br />
<br />
I'm probably also going to purchase Ykesha for my other weapon.  And more than likely I'll buy into Sony's silly end-game routine and get the most expensive one just to be fucking safe.  I wouldn't do it for the extra DD as I seriously doubt that'll help at all with hate - but I would do it both because the proc rate may be different and because I want to know that I have the absolute best proc available and didn't wimp out half way through the purchase.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KhalimBloodhelm</div><div class="date">09-12-2003, 03:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ALLOW me to ELABORATE.  First of all, 300 Anger is 1150 points, as is Wrath of the Ykesha.  200 Anger is 760, as is Force of the Ykesha.  But since all Ykesha procs have the stun, which is the REAL aggro, the 1150 one wouldn't be much more aggro.  <br />
<br />
Now, it is my stipulation that Ykesha proc is &gt; Anger in aggro.  Heres my reasoning.  All the warriors I've talked to pretty much aggro that GBoS is &gt; Aggro than CHSD.  CHSD is 450 Hate.  GBoS is almost identicle proc as Ykesha except with slightly larger DD.  DD is not a major factor in aggro.  I beleive the formula is AT MOST 1 point of hate per point of DD, and probably less.  So, if 179 dd+ stun &gt; aggro than 450 Hate, its fairly reasonable to assume that even 100 dd + stun would be much &gt; aggro than 300 hate.  <br />
<br />
There =P.  <br />
<br />
On a side note, there is supposedly a Bite of the Ykesha, but how many points is it, and with 200 Points + at Guk camp, i still can't see it at the adventure merchants. Maybe this is a dropped augment?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vigdis SangCaru</div><div class="date">09-12-2003, 03:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">None of that takes into account the proc rates, which we still haven't figured out.  If one procs more frequently than the other the whole formula above is out of wack. <br />
<br />
And while I do main hand GBoS and offhand CHSD, it was a close call.  I haven't parsed it, but I think they both agro just about equally (I just think GBoS procs more frequently than CHSD, when I've tested mainhand with each).  I also prefer the slightly better dmg/dly of GBoS.<br />
<br />
Aw hell, 1150 it is then for Anger III....guess I'll be in Miragul's longer than I hoped.</div></div><hr />

I suspect I will be pushing the mobs pretty significantly once I get these procs added to my weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">09-12-2003, 05:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't see pushing as a problem.  Been using SoD/SotB/GBoS for a long time and I don't see myself pushing mobs all over the place.  Weapons proc twice a minute, and the knockback is only a foot.  Not even enough to counter the pushing all the melees on the back side are doing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Saw a param named &quot;spainindex&quot; in lucy... wondering if that might be used as a hate modifier (spainindex = special pain index??).  Also noticed that a lot of the weapon procs had -25 resist mods added, a nice change, and that quite a few of them seem to check the wrong resists (vox's bite saves vs. fire???).<br />
<br />
Push will probably only be an issue in a few spots; if the mob is on an incline you'll get more movement in the &quot;down&quot; direction, also in places with bad pathing, it'll cause em to warp around a bit more if they get off the &quot;sweet spots&quot;.  Some zones seem to have different &quot;friction&quot; modifiers too, tho I have no clue how to test that and it's just a suspicion/observation, not a fact...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wompem Ondahed</div><div class="date">09-12-2003, 08:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Unless testing dictates otherwise I would cerntainly say Ykesha is atleast equal or greater than 300 hate. Epic Redblade anyone? Ykesha proc can easily steal aggro from a redblade proc as far as I have seen. <br />
<br />
About the push: In a raid setting where you corner tank you would have to proc every swing before you could ever compensate for 20+ melee and pets grinding a mob into you and the wall. For xp groups, I enjoy proccing a knockback for the most part, because the rouge, rogue pet, mage pet, etc etc are still at the back of the mob if I can help it, and sometimes I need procs to keep the mob in the middle of a hallway.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, it is very early for speculation. I still need to save massive points and I should try not to be in too much of a hurry yet. Itemization has known to be changed ( for good or bad ) shortly after release.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gimmel</div><div class="date">09-12-2003, 08:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's &quot;spaindex&quot;, and it determines what particle effect is shown when the spell is cast. Amount of aggro caused is for the most part a server side concern, so there is no need to have than info in the spell data file.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Remf da Troll</div><div class="date">09-12-2003, 09:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah, doh- spa-index, something-particle-something-index I'd imagine.  Of course all the hate stuff would be purely server side.  Funny how ya parse terms when you are preoccupied with something, I was checking proc effects as a function of aggro, and saw the &quot;pain&quot; bit.  Duh. ;)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ranna Swiftpaw</div><div class="date">09-13-2003, 05:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd be curious to find out myself.<br />
<br />
I've been pondering what to slap into my warrior's Split Blade of Destruction.  I got it mainly for duoing DPS.  But now I can turn it into an MTing weapon :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Force Shock seems to proc in the Copper Hammer (main, or offhand) at a decent rate.  So I too am curious which procs more.  The DD+stun, or the instant hate.  I've grouped with tanks using a GBoS and been able to shake aggro without too much trouble.  The CHSD on the otherhand, I end up tanking more than the tank does.  Too much stress for both parties, so I just simply avoid tanks with them.  It's not a bad weapon for it's level range, but it's not enough to prevent a high end rogue from getting whacked every time they hit the backstab key.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for the knockback flag, that's already been removed on test, as well as adding resistance modifiers for the higher end proc augs to make them even more useful.<br />
<br />
<br />
From a rogue's point of view, the lifetaps might be handy, but they generate more aggro than DD.  You have to remember, they are both a DD and a heal.  So Vampire's Kiss which is a 75pt lifetap, is really 75dd + 75 heal.  It's interesting, but not with it's present FR resist check.   Rogues already have too many FR based weapons with PoP.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Guard and Spell Guard is what has me interested.  I've been waiting to see what the casters say about the spells though.  They might have a hefty aggro component as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">09-13-2003, 02:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lifetaps aren't more aggro than DD.  They might even be less.  It doesn't make sense, but lifetaps are very low aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sorguran</div><div class="date">09-14-2003, 11:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">IMO I was thinking about going with anger just for the pure and simple fact that the lack of a lvl restriction to use on mobs, in addition to the fact that it doesn't need a stun to be great aggro, would be better imo,  and the chance of mobs resisting is non exsistant,  so yeah,  Ykesha may be a lil better aggro,  but I'm going with anger3</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flair</div><div class="date">09-14-2003, 04:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">haven't parsed it, but I think they both agro just about equally (I just think GBoS procs more frequently than CHSD, when I've tested mainhand with each). <br />
<br />
That is consistent with what I have seen as well.  I think you can't go wrong purchasing either mod.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KhalimBloodhelm</div><div class="date">09-14-2003, 04:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think its funny people keep saying that they want to go with Anger because it cannot be resisted like Ykesha, and that they are worried about the stun not landing on higher mobs, when its a well known fact that resisted stuns (as with almost any proc) create just as much aggro as landed stuns.  It doesn't matter than the stun never lands.  I use GBoS and that stun lands on almost NO mob that I fight now (Elemental, Time, etc) but the aggro is still just as good as if the stuns landed.  Stun procs are excellent aggro whether they are resisted or not, and the bottom line is that a stun proc is always going to be &gt; Aggro than 300 hate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mourningloree</div><div class="date">09-14-2003, 05:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Next question is:<br />
<br />
The Anger 3 aug in Miragul is 1h only.  Are there any 2h Anger augs?  Are all of the Ykesha Aug's 2hable?  Looking for what's best to add to a BOW...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KhalimBloodhelm</div><div class="date">09-15-2003, 10:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, Ykesha is 2hs applicable.  And I don't know of any anger proc that is usable on 2hs.  <br />
<br />
The other odd thing I'm noticing is that on many of the lists going over 1150 points, Wrath of Ykesha and Anger 3 are not listed as buyable, which leads me to beleive they only drop on raids, possibly off boss mobs.  This may be true for the final level of several of the proc augments.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kailyn</div><div class="date">09-15-2003, 08:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actaully I am quite temped to save up for the 75 lifetap for my GSoT (or whatever 2h I will have at the time) because in normal missions I get minned a fair amount for 77 HP. So a random 75 point heal every once in a while sounds like it could be quite handy.</div></div><hr />

However it isn't available at 1150points, can anyone confirm or deny that there is an anger 3 augment from mistmoore?</div></div><hr />

I thought another Anger III item could be bought at MMC but it's no longer showing up.<br />
<br />
Also, Wrath of Ykesha is a confirmed raid drop, so it's not going to be easy to get.  Might as well buy Anger III for one weapon and hope you can grab Wrath of Ykesha for the other.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vigdis SangCaru</div><div class="date">09-24-2003, 04:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A friend suggested to me that there is a calculation for 0.0 stun procs as follows:<br />
<br />
stun with a DD = 2x the agro of the dd and a dd = 1 agro point per dammage.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know where he might have come by this notion or if there is any substance to it?  Doesn't seem that clear to me from reading these boards.  I presume since so many people presume Ykesha generates more hate than Anger3 there must be some alternative analysis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">faederya</div><div class="date">09-24-2003, 05:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem with Ykesha proc'ing Force Shock weapons will be the 0.0 stun knockback. <br />
<br />
The stun is going to be resisted on mobs 55+ so won't the &quot;knockback&quot; not be an issue?<br />
<br />
Ykesha is atleast equal or greater than 300 hate. Epic Redblade anyone? Ykesha proc can easily steal aggro from a redblade proc as far as I have seen.  <br />
<br />
Red Epic is/can be resisted a majority of the time, the Anger proc is unresistable.<br />
<br />
Resist: Unresistable <br />
Anger3 (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=4394&amp;source=Live) <br />
<br />
I have not fought in LDoN very much but my two Droga weapons can barely keep agro in there :/<br />
<br />
Did they change stuns in LDoN to not give agro on a resists? If so then the yeksha is USELESS since the stun is resisted on 55+ mobs.<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT : not resisted on 55+ but Immune? or unnaffected? whatever, you get the drift from the other huge post about stuns vs 55+</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can tell you so far in a few days of having Anger II is is just a tad less agro than Planar Strike.<br />

I have herd mentioned else where proc is weapon determined not proc determined.</div></div><hr />
