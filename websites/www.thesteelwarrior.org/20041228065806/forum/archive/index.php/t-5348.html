<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bumamgar</div><div class="date">01-23-2004, 09:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I run a &quot;small&quot; guild of about 55 members.  We've just broken in to the Elemental planes after about 3 months of gear farming in VT.<br />
<br />
We stress high playtime and skill over numbers, and since we are small, we don't have an over-abundance of any one class.<br />
<br />
We have 9 clerics in the guild, all of whom we geared up extremely well in VT.<br />
<br />
However, recently, many of them have simply stopped logging in.  Or they show up late.<br />
<br />
It has become a serious problem, when only 2 out of 9 clerics are online at raid time.  2 clerics simply doesn't cut it for Elemental encounters :)<br />
<br />
In speaking to other guilds on my server (Erollisi Marr) many of them solve this problem by simply double boxing clerics as needed.<br />
<br />
We've avoided going this route, but I am curious how elemental+ guilds on other servers handle this problem?  Is it common practice to simply have some of your reliable players box in clerics to run CH rots on a daily basis, or have you been able to find 8 - 10 reliable clerics who are consistant about being online on a regular basis?<br />
<br />
I know some guilds on our server simply recruit anyone regardless of playtime, and boast rosters of 200+ members, which allows them to have 8 - 10 clerics online at any time, but then these same guilds end up with extremely poor gear distribution and significant back-flagging issues.<br />
<br />
We'd like to stay small, and we've had no problem recruiting high-playtime dedicated Warriors, etc.  It just seems like high-playtime, dedicated Clerics are impossible to find.<br />
<br />
Is this a cross server issue, or have I just been extremely unlucky?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frax</div><div class="date">01-23-2004, 09:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">recruit recruit recruit clerics whenever you get a chance, I'm pretty sure most every guild has seen this at one time or another.  It is just more noticeable because you can raid with one warrior or one shaman.. but not with one cleric most of the time. <br />
:(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tsaotsao</div><div class="date">01-23-2004, 10:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cleric is the hardest class to stick it out with in EQ.<br />
<br />
I used to get frustrated with how some clerics would be.  I would think, wow, they are really sensitive!!!  And in our guild, every cleric that made it to the high 50's was recruited out by a larger guild. They got promises of loot, attention, etc... It was disgusting.<br />
<br />
The clerics we had who got recruited out like that all left EQ not long after.<br />
<br />
Then I played a friend of mine's cleric and I found I was getting into the same mindset.  I mean, after playing a warrior, and then getting on my friend's cleric and getting my ass kicked by a green was nuts.  And in groups having to be completely focussed on everyone's health bar.. well it wears on you. But dam people love you. They want you around for sure.<br />
<br />
What I see now is that guilds do all the above for clerics... 2-box, recruit, PL, borrow, etc.. anything to get enough clerics.<br />
<br />
I grew up around druids for the most part.  But I respect anyone who can play and stick with being a cleric.  It's most needed and dam tough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grimmlokk</div><div class="date">01-23-2004, 11:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Most of the guilds on my server seem to just take any cleric that considers applying. Not unusual to see 14 clerics on from one of our time guilds. I have a screenshot of 17 on one raid with them. Which sounds like a ton to me considering we get like 5 for a packed raid. But most other people seem to just accept it as normal.<br />
<br />
 You probably don't wanna go that route. So 2-boxing is the answer. Some of our members box clerics that just aren't on. Some have their own alt clerics they drag along. And some of us just play whatever class is needed usually. It's a whole different perspective when you've played 5-6 different classes for most of the encounters=P But not too fun to be forced to camp your main char.<br />
<br />
 So either get some folks to start playing other's clerics, or take every fuckin cleric you can get your hands on. Most of your clerics will be shitty, but even a chimp can count to 2 and hit a CH key after a few training sessions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Findra</div><div class="date">01-23-2004, 12:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">but even a chimp can count to 2 and hit a CH key after a few training sessionsYou hit the nail on the head with your parting comment.<br />
<br />
Ever look at what your clerics do on a raid?  A good number of them are doing nothing else besides mashing a CH key with whatever delay is mandated by the mob, how many clerics are there, etc.  The lucky ones actually get to be patch and AE healers - waiting for someone to call out that the need a heal, are taking rampage, etc. or just watching the MA health just in case it drops below 40% so they can get a life-saving fast heal off.<br />
<br />
If you tought running a cleric in XP grinds was hard - try doing nothing on raids beside casting CH every 14 seconds for 5-30 minutes (or more I hear in some encounters).<br />
<br />
Oh, and if you are off by a second or two the MA dies and you have a good chance of wiping the raid.<br />
<br />
/em bows down before the clerics that keep her alive</div></div><hr />

I am not surprised you have this problem, I would imaging that many high end guilds do. We have 15 clerics on our roster and we often have people box clerics for encounters that need more than 5 clerics to succeed. Playing a raid cleric seems more like a job than fun to me, that might account for the high retire rate of high end clerics.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We come up with ways to pass the time. When my guild cleared trash in VT, there was a game we had in cleric chat for those of us that didn't want to /join cyber :rolleyes: <br />
We'd all land nukes on a mob at around 5% health and keep track of which cleric had the most killshots. No prizes or anything, just a game to keep us awake.<br />
<br />
As far as elementals, clearing trash can be fun sometimes for a cleric that isn't one of the lazy dumbasses sleeping until the rotation starts. Cheating death keeping people alive isn't that bad.<br />
<br />
Rotations can be pretty good too; I made the chains myself, so it might just have been because I was more involved, but they aren't as bad as you make them out to be. Lots of great memories - being one of only 3 clerics alive as Blazzax hits the ground, having only 300hp left thanks to a partial DI I cast on myself, because I knew the shaman assigned to me would find a way to die = $$ ;) .</div></div><hr />

<br />
We have around 10 active real clerics now, but just 2 warriors.... I mean, I like the attention and all, but it's stupid when making the MT list consists of no more than deciding which 1 wants to tank. Rampage mobs are the pits as we both have our discs down for the next 10 minutes. Not to mention mobs like General Reparm whose sole purpose in existance seems to be to remind us how much the devs must have hated warriors when designing PoP.... And when we both die, there is allmost nothing standing between the guild and a wipe, which frankly blows. <br />
<br />
The solution the guild tried was to box warriors.......but seeing as our job on raids is just a little bit tougher than boxing a cleric it hasn 't allways been successfull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daramin</div><div class="date">01-26-2004, 04:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Shit, on my server, if you're in EP's and announce that you're recruiting warriors you instantly have 10 apps.<br />
<br />
Announce that you're recruiting clerics and everyone goes &quot;/yawn, you and everyone else, take a number.&quot;<br />
<br />
So fixing the &quot;too few warriors&quot; problem is a hell of a lot easier than fixing not having enough clerics online sometimes.<br />
<br />
At one point we had the top guild on our server recruiting people away from the #2 guild primarily, who then recruited people away from #'s 3 and 4 in their timezone, and a ton of people then got recruited into EP's...  Like being a grunt in a live war, you can get promoted real fast when folks are burning out at the top end so quickly.<br />
<br />
So far we haven't lost a lot of clerics, so we haven't had to get agro about recruiting, but I'm not sure I could tell you why. Not as many CH rotations, maybe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually I think your guild has to find the reason why High-end warrior keeps retiring from your guild first.<br />
By the way, boxing a tank is not a job that hitting the defensive disc and /attack on<br />
You have to know how to place , how to corner , watch the cch rolling and keep your eyes on named and watch the time to open disc to tank<br />
I don't think a boxing or pher can do these things well. Probably can but easy make trouble</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaqyl</div><div class="date">01-27-2004, 06:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I 2box a cleric fulltime.  For over 2 years now seeing me without my clericbot is rare enough to cause comment by anyone that knows me.  I'm involved in all our CHRs, have done group heals for SolRo and others, RT heals, spamheals, DI duty, all usually while playing ST, RT, or TM with my warrior.<br />
<br />
I can say without a doubt that I would have burnt out a long time ago playing JUST my cleric.  Our cleric &quot;leader&quot; who usually sets up the CHR and any other healing needed on raids has been an in game friend for over 2 years, and I can tell he has to work at not being bored with the class.  But he does it quite well, everything from the nukecompetition, to meleeing almost every named while keeping up the CHR, to hosting debates in the cleric channel to keep everyone awake ;-P<br />
<br />
As far as the cleric problem goes, we have two &quot;guild bot&quot; clerics that all the officers and several others have access to and play at various raids when needed, also mainchar clerics are often botted by irl/ingame friends on raids when our numbers are tight.  Nowadays we usually field 9-15 clerics on any given raid, usually 4-6 of which are bots of one form or another.  We've never been an active recruiting guild, but despite being guild number 5-6 on the server for the last year we've never really had a huge problem with our cleric numbers.<br />
<br />
As stated above the solution to the cleric situations for most guilds involves a little bit of everything from bots, to botting mainchars, to heavy recruiting, to incentives . . . you just have to find whats right for your guild.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Botting a warrior is not necessarily harder than botting class X. If the player knows enough, botting any class is trivial as long as the player is somewhat competent.<br />
<br />
Only way you can fix your problem is finding other clerics and in the meantime bot some clerics for the rotas when needed.</div></div><hr />

You'd better have some time geared warrior (and clerics)though.<br />
Just using SL a single cleric can heal ~ 100 000 hp over 2mn30 sec while blazzax will do about 120 000 dmg over the same period. Of course bad dmg spike will kill you, but I bet with 2k+ AC dmg spike are rather rare on blazzax.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haass</div><div class="date">01-28-2004, 02:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In my opinion, a lot of people that have problems with cleric attendance or whatnot don't allow 2 boxing in the guild.  No loot/raid points for the second toon.  Well, that's all fine and dandy, until you're in the position you're in now.  There was a situation where I would be 2 boxing for a 2nd tier guild on the server, but they wanted me to pick a main.  Fuck that shit.  If i'm providing a service to the guild by expending more energy than other people and covering a character that needs to be covered, then I should be compensated for it.  If you don't like to think of it that way, then what incentive would other people have to box clerics or something to make your raids work?<br />
<br />
I understand that a lot of people (most of them with 1 computer) don't think that way, but I thought I'd offer the solution to your problem.  Cleric001 isn't online, but is roommies with Rogue 02?  The solution is obvious, something to think about.  Would you rather not raid at all, or have to toss a piece of loot to a boxed cleric once every couple of weeks?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">1ludor</div><div class="date">01-28-2004, 04:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">its hard to justify giving loot to a bot though, normally we just give the points to the persons main. <br />
<br />
its not easy though, still need to spend some time gearing up bot clerics somehow, lots of good 100hp gear out there that is doable with 1 or 2 groups. or use guild funds to buy what is available.<br />
<br />
ultimately you just need to recruit more clerics. xegony and rathe are going to take 8+ clerics minuim and the raids get drastically easier the more you have. if you have potime asperations, you are going to want the clerics later down the road anyways, why not get them now instead of later and have to reflag.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaqyl</div><div class="date">01-28-2004, 11:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">its hard to justify giving loot to a bot though <br />
<br />
Why?  I can guarantee you I put ALOT more effort into playing my warrior/cleric 2box setup than any of your rangers plinking away in the background, or for that matter most dps classes . . . including the other warriors farther down the chain that rarely tank.  My guild works like this on loot . . .<br />
<br />
full member mains<br />
full member bots<br />
trial/applicant status<br />
<br />
the only problem is, we're on merit, which means loot doesn't get passed up by mains because of point conservation, if its a minor upgrade usually someone will send a tell on it.  Ironically enough out of a roster of 18+ mainchar clerics in my guild, my bot outgears 15 of them.  His magelo is in my sig . . . face, head, arms, boots, prim, sec are all rotraiddrops(passed on by all mains present), everything else is bought/quested/1grouped.  My cleric represents at least 80% of my nonraid effort on personal gear, and I can tell you its more than a little frustraighting to watch a newly minted mainchar cleric walk away from a raid with gear my clericbot could only dream of, when my bot has been CHRing for my guild for over a year.<br />
<br />
If you have botters that play their second char well, treat them well, especially when that bot is a cleric.  It doesn't take much, not crumbs, but one decent piece of gear for every 5 you give to your mainchar clerics would go a LONG way to make the effort feel appreciated.<br />
<br />
I'm a botter, a good one, and I'm bitter, I've just decided to funnel my bitterness into keeping my cleric into the top echelon of the guild despite the lack of raiddrops.  Not everyone will take this solution, lots will quit botting, or just quit, be kind to those that put out the extra effort.</div></div><hr />

Well I am not saying botting a warrior is very hard<br />
But I can tell you botting a cle to heal / CHR is the mostly simply task to do.<br />
Whenever you know how to hit assist hotkey and fast heal hotkey and you know how to count 1 and hit your CH hotkey, you can do a good but boring cle job.</div></div><hr />

If you ever become capable of playing 2, and have 2 high end toons, you'll feel the same way when you contribute to the success off raids and still get treated like one toon.<br />

I'm not gonna argue your personal EQ beliefs tho.  If you want to do that, then I hope the guys that are capable of 2 boxing tell you to fuck off when you're one cleric short.</div></div><hr />

<br />
its trivial, and am i going to ask for or bid for loot over someone who plays a full time cleric, i dont think so. eventually p1/p2 loot will rot and sure loot away, but until then it doesnt make sense to gear bots.<br />
<br />
there is enough gear obtainable with with xp groups to reasonably equip a bot cleric. its certainly more fun to play 2 characters than 1 on any raid because the game isnt that hard, i dont consider it a burden to bot a cleric at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why do we reward gimps, it is simple if not for the people who 2 box in our guild we would not have progressed half as far as we did.  We had a gimp warrior that became our main tank for 6 months, which allowed us to get into elem planes.</div></div><hr />

I think whatever your guild decides is the loot rules they use is fine. I'd rather have a happy guild budy then have another thing for my bot. Once you progress gear will start rot and that will be perfect bot equip which wont be pissing anyone off.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The main reason I am not in a guild is that they don't plan on giving my 6 box squad the 3-5 dkp I figure I should get. I play 6 toons, if I am doing say 4X the damage of a single toon I don't see why I should not get 4dkp.... <br />
<br />
Thats being said there is no way I could CH rotation and/or MT and/or CC with my 1 war, 1 clr, 1 chanter, 3 wiz set up tied to one keyboard. And its just to costly for a 6 boxer to run one or two toons instead of getting 1percentAA per toon per 20 second kill in LDoN or whereever.  A four hour raid costs me 6AA, and some lootz, and some 600LDoN points.... <br />
<br />
Bout all I can do on raids is offtank/kill (i.e. whoever is raid main chanter I would assist him he mez 3 mobs, I offtank and then kill one, then the next and finally the last), not as important as MT/CH but raids wipe to adds often enough.<br />
<br />
Playing a cleric only is so incredably boring thats it unbelivible anyone plays the class...  After Pulling, Slowing, Main Tanking, CCing, Healing, nuking etc. with a 6 box crew just hitting CH every so often is so boaring its unreal. <br />
<br />
Oh well looks like its LDoN loots for me.. gots like 14,000 total points so far and hopefully will be able to solo hards (its all in getting single pulls) at some point in the future.</div></div><hr />

<br />
From my point of view it seems clerics have atleast as much to do as warriors and probably more.<br />
<br />
Prepping:<br />
- Clerics are buffing (DI, Vie, BoR, KM, Virtue)<br />
- Warriirs can afk<br />
<br />
Deaths / Wipes:<br />
- Clerics are rezzing and rebuffing<br />
- Warriors can afk<br />
<br />
Coordination:<br />
- Clerics rely constantly on 5-8 other clerics to perform within seconds<br />
- Warriors more of less take turns working meaning the reliance and hence need of coordination is several orders of magnitudes less.<br />
 <br />
So, sure you can bot a cleric and be part of the chain - but then you likely wont be the one doing the actual work of rezzing, buffing and coordinating the heals - thus giving you the impression that its dirt easy.<br />
<br />
Mind, I am not complaning - but as a main cleric that actually does my job I dont see many classes that are busier than I during raids. Pullers and raidleaders - definitely. MT for long stretches of trash, certainly. But thats not full classes - merely selected individuals.</div></div><hr />

LIke I said..the people that don't understand are usually playing one character. If you ever become capable of playing 2, and have 2 high end toons, you'll feel the same way when you contribute to the success off raids and still get treated like one toon. I'm not gonna argue your personal EQ beliefs tho.  If you want to do that, then I hope the guys that are capable of 2 boxing tell you to fuck off when you're one cleric short.  <br />
<br />
I have seen totally incompetant clerics bitch when two boxers were even considered for loot. The ones who complain about practicing the CH chain, then screw it up. The best solution? Count the bot as a FULL member, thats what OEM did, and we pulled off stuff we would not have otherwise.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For everyday stuff sure, when things gets messy noway.<br />
<br />
It's about the same as to why haveing 1 person run all CH clerics is stupid. If you don't understand why it's stupid then you need to open your eyes abit.<br />
<br />
Some people dual-tripple-etc-box really good but none does it just as well as 2-3-4-5-6 copies of that person playing 1 toon each.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I cant play 2 better than I can play 1.<br />
<br />
But I can play 2 better than a lot of other people can play 1.<br />
<br />
You also must ask yourself. If you are raiding, you prefer 2 clerics played REALLY good, or 2 REALLY good clerics, and 4 so-so ones?<br />
<br />
eh?<br />

Our guild's main cleric is my clerical role model, he kicks ass.  Grouping, raiding, W/E he's always playing his char to the max.  I would NEVER claim to play my 2box cleric as well as him.  That said, I've run across PLENTY of mainchar clerics that play their one char worse than my left hand plays my cleric.  No, I'm not as good with two chars as two players of equal/greater skill, but I'm good to warrant comment from nonguildies that haven't grouped with me before.  And my guildies? alot of them would group with me over all but a few of our mainchar clerics.<br />
<br />
To reiterate, its not about claiming you can be AS efficient on two toons as you would be on one, its that many botters can be AS or MORE efficient on multiple chars than single players of a lower skill caliber can be with one char.  Unfortunately, nowadays, said low caliber players aren't the exceptions so much as the rule.</div></div><hr />

Dude, the topic is concerned about the huge need of cle from EP/time battles.<br />
What we are talking about seriously is how to maintain a CCH<br />
What a BOT cle has to do is count 1 and hit 1 button<br />
We don't say cle is an easy work , but cch is</div></div><hr />

well played clerics are fantastic.  and they are more than just CH pushers.  <br />

My girl started a cleric and she has developed a skill set that really impressed me and shed a few of my notions regarding how hard it is to play a cleric.</div></div><hr />

Thats all there is to it. It is very sad that EQ so heavily dependant on war/cleric for 99% of raid encounters. I am all for classes beeing more versetile and encounters that can be done a couple of different ways without connecr tanking and without Verant screaming &quot;ban them all&quot;</div></div><hr />
