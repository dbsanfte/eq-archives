<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Longern</div><div class="date">07-03-2004, 06:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know you guys get a lot of these, but I'm new, so here's mine:<br />
<br />
Would any of you mind giving me your opinion on what I should upgrade going forward? I'm an &quot;upgrade for the future so I can forget about gear and enjoy tanking&quot; type of guy...<br />
<br />
Here's my magelo: <br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1057548<br />
<br />
Specifically, I'm having aggro issues versus less intelligent players and I'm wondering if a BoC/CHoS combo (anger 3 aug'd eventually) would take care of that or if I'd be better served getting some Horned Spiked Shoulder Plates, a Heavy Rubi Girdle and Velium Gemmed Gaunts - leaving the BoC for later...?<br />
<br />
The BoC is around 350-400k on my server (which is full of gouging bastards) and I hate wasting money for an upgrade that won't help.<br />
<br />
For some reason, magelo doesn't report some of my skills correctly...so some are higher than they look (taunt, etc).<br />
<br />
Any help you guys could provide would be greatly appreciated. <br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frostpaw</div><div class="date">07-03-2004, 07:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;I'm having aggro issues versus less intelligent players&quot;<br />
<br />
In my experience this can not be prevented with any amount of gear/plat/augs. That being said, BoC and CHoS is a terrific combo. Your gear is already good, and I think that if agro is your biggest worry then a BoC is the way to go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikken</div><div class="date">07-03-2004, 07:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">BoC isn't worth the money, that would be better spent on upgrades. A3 that combo, and concentrate on your AC/HPs. There's nothing you can do about idiots, let them die and laugh at their corpse, then tell them why they suck and shouldn't do that again. I have it hotkeyed.<br />
<br />
Upgrade the shoulders, lose the cloak, do the loyalist shield quest, grab haste belt. Grab a yellow fang earring if you can find one for sale.<br />
<br />
IMO you are doing great, just concentrate on AC/HP. If you have the time to hop on a Xan raid in PoI, Try for the CHSD, it's warrior only, and most of the time I've been with my druid, there have only been 2 or 3 warrior at that encounter, making it a fairly easy score for your agro setup.<br />
<br />
Other than that, not much else you can do until you hit 55 and are able to do ornate. GL on that ornate is wayyy over priced on my server. I'll probably be in fierce out of spite long after I'm able to afford ornate. There's no way I'm going to help anyone price gouge warriors as much as they do with ornate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Longern</div><div class="date">07-03-2004, 09:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you for responding.<br />
<br />
Why lose the cloak? AC issues? (I have a Lodi I could wear there...)<br />
<br />
Which belt would you suggest? I chose CoF over a belt due to increased haste percentage on it - but I could save pp with a RBB or similar I suppose. Any advice on that?<br />
<br />
Ornate is crazy on my server too, so that'll have to wait. I loathe gougers, personally, so I'll probably be in FH for a while too....unless someone tosses some farwater up for trade. I might pay for that...<br />
<br />
I'd love a BoC, but I'm concerned about switching-out haste items to afford one.<br />
<br />
Also, here is what I'm considering for updrades - are they worth it?<br />
<br />
Horn Spiked Shoulder Plates - 70kish<br />
else: Crystallized Acid Pauldrons - 100k+<br />
Boots of the Storm - 60-80k area<br />
Velium Gemmed Gauntlets - 125k-ish<br />
Heavy Rubi Girdle (unless I switch to haste there) - 50k<br />
Legs: Farwater - 250k+<br />
Wrist: Mana-Threaded Bone Bracelet - 50-55k.<br />
<br />
Sorry to noob-on at you guys, but my main is a Druid and I'm sick of playing him. I'm having too much fun playing a tank - I love it.<br />
<br />
Thanks for taking time on your weekend(s) to answer!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Seraz</div><div class="date">07-04-2004, 01:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I strongly suggest doing the Strength of the Elements quest, easy and the places to obtain the pieces aren't hard to get to.<br />
1. Go to Lavastorm Mountains, grab a fusible igneous ore from the ground.<br />
2. Kill Phinny in Kedge Keep, he is a pansy, take fusible coral ore.<br />
3. Head down to the Hole where Guardian of the Seal is (jump down from Paineel with SoE) pull the animated constructs next the GoTS and loot fusible earthen ore from one.<br />
4. Take a port with a druid to Cobalt scar, zone into Siren's Grotto and evac thru and zone into Western Wastes. Run around the zone a bit and get druid to track Guardian Kozzalym, easy mob, kill and loot fusible velium ore.<br />
5. Track for Makil Rargon, human, speak to him about fusibility research etc etc. Get books, get box, put all the ores into the box, hit combine and hand it back to Makil Rargon. <br />
6. Now you have some awesome Warrior shoulders!<br />

He means Skyfire Mountains, not lavastorm :P<br />
<br />
Did my SotE quest in 2 days, would have done it in 1 but Phinny wasnt up when i checked that night grrr...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
 The reason you need to lose the cloak is you are losing out on a crapload of AC, 40 to be exact, that can be gotten by doing a very easy quest. The Loyalist Shield of Honor. The quest starts out in Katta, there a plenty of threads here to get info about it. It's really worth it.<br />
<br />
As for the belt haste, thats really a personal preference for most people, but losing out on all that AC from equiping the haste on your back is sad. I'd look whats available on your server and see what slot will have the least impact on your stats and use that as your haste slot. For me thats the belt, since all I would really be able to afford for that slot would be fierce, or similar, so the loss isn't that much. You really don't &quot;need&quot; to have anything more than 31 or 36 haste (can't remember) becasue with vallian's you will be max haste without a bard for overhaste, if i understand correctly.<br />
<br />
Your choices look good so far, but I'd look into the SotE quest that was mentined. I'll be doing that quest next myself.<br />
<br />
Hope you are enjoying the class, I did the exact same thing as you are doing. I have a druid that I started with, but now I only play her to farm pp or items or to help out guildies. Other than that, I play my warrior almost exclusively.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frostpaw</div><div class="date">07-04-2004, 06:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't get wrapped around the axel of what slot to put haste into. You obviously have access to good amounts of plat, and id recommend using tribute haste. This frees you up to use the best AC/HP pieces you can get in each slot. <br />
<br />
As far as the BoC being overpriced, opinions vary on that.  I happen to think that with the quality of your existing gear, it would be a worthwhile and enjoyable purchase.  At 51 you would get a tremendous amount of use from an item that is nearly impossible to replace if you aren't a raider. Also, its droppable and has held its value extremely well. <br />
<br />
If you decide against buying the BoC, do quested back and shoulders as suggested above, get Heavy Rubi Girdle then go nuts leveling. Your gear is really very nice.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yoda</div><div class="date">07-04-2004, 11:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">fisrt thing you HAVE TO GET is a haste item (usually belt).<br />
second thing you REALLY NEED is better weapon (have you ever hold aggro more than 5s with them?)<br />
your weakest slot by order are :<br />
1. your belt (9 AC is good below lvl 35 but after you really need haste over anything else to be able to hold aggro)<br />
2. both wrists<br />
3. boots and glove<br />
4. gold ring and both earings (very good but you should try to find something better in your 50ies)<br />
5. augment the rest if you have more adv. than you need and if you don't get anything better at that time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dwavlin</div><div class="date">07-04-2004, 03:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thx, Yoda.<br />
<br />
Yes- I have several alternate weaps, so I was really asking for Armor advice.   I have already upgraded a bit, and will be modifying the magelo profile later today, hopefully with a better belt.  Thx, much!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Longern</div><div class="date">07-05-2004, 05:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">UPDATE: I found a BoC and ditched my SoTB in favor of that and my CHoS. Aggro problems have vanished.<br />
<br />
Also sold my CoF. Going to replace it with a Spiked Seahorse Hide belt and am going to take your advice and do the shoulder/back slot quests.  That and some Boots of the Storm + Ornate Gloves should set me up nicely into 60+. Might add a Mana-Threaded Bone Bracelet as well if I have enough pp left-over.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your advice - it was good stuff!<br />

(I assume anyone who can afford a BoC can afford a month's worth of 41% haste tribute.)  I would personally replace that cloak as soon as you can, and if you can make it a 36% haste cloak, so much the better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've borrowed an RBB from my rogue...31% is fine for now. I'm thinking of buying a haste aug and augging the Heavy Rubi Girdle...I'll have to check the aug type though (can't remember presently). Otherwise, I'll probably be going with the Spiked Seahorse Hide Belt and Ornate Gaunts for clicky haste. That should do it, I'd imagine.<br />
<br />
I've got quite a few tribute points that I've been using for HP/AC...I'll probably take your advice and add haste as well.<br />

<br />
Robe of the Tempest (29k tribute) costs what, 5k to buy?  1.5k to make from a rune?  The cost of one seahorse hide belt would buy you 41% tribute haste for more than 100 days /played time.<br />
<br />
Given how cheap haste is through tribute, I suggest you spend your LDON points on something else. :)</div></div><hr />
