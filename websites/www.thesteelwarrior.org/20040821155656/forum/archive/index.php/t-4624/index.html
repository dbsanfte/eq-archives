<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gunrack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am trying to compile my own list of the changes.  Specifically Beneficial/Detrimental/Discipline Opening changes.  One thing that I have noticed while on test is that aside from getting Offensive and Defensive Openings I also get &quot;special&quot; openings.  Well, I was trying to read on lucy how to determine which of these new skills and such are &quot;special&quot; and have come to guess but would like to know if some of you have either come to the same conclusion or already know for a fact if I'm right/wrong.<br />
<br />
Ok, here is how I read it.  Take a skill like Backslash... when you go to lucy it shows it has an endurance cost and it has a red icon.. so even though the effect is unreadable to me &quot;unknown XXX&quot;  from the icon and the name I can pretty much determine is an offensive skill.<br />
<br />
There are others that even though the icon is blue and it sounds defensive/beneficial in nature.. do not have an endurance cost... are these the special only opening skills?  I would know myself but I must admit that I do not have a character on test and was only able to /testbuff 25 and test out like 3 or 4 skills that were avaliable to the warriors at that level.  So, could anyone help me understand these or is everyone pretty much waiting to find out when they go live/they give more info?  Any help would be appreciated.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Babadski</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've been trying to figue this out myself by watching for which icons highlight with which openings.  I have my list at home for the skills I have at 54.  I'll try to remember to post it.  Most of the skills I have actually activate under the Special Openings.  What's confusing me is that they all don't come up with every special opening.  I've yet to see anything highlight when I get a defensive opening.  And I've only had one or two come up under offensive openings.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'm still experimenting and watching the different openings.  What I am pretty sure of is this stuff isn't going to be even *close* to being ready for production servers by the 16th.  It obviously still needs a lot of work. &lt;giggle&gt; and I'm one of the proponents of the system!</div></div><hr />
