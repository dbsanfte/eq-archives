<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gorthag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been working on a spreadsheet for quickly auto-computing mobs' hit spreads and average dps during any combination/absense of defensive/evasive/vie, based on current level of shielding and AAs, using min hit and min hit+1 as dataset (can easily adjust formulas to base off min/max, harder to tell if you actually receive a max hit with really high AC though)<br />
<br />
The formulas I've been using appear to be working alright, but dont quite line up sometimes, and I'm missing a couple hard numbers that would be easier to get from you folks if anyone knows already than to figure out through backcalculating - also would like to get confirmation that the formulas I'm using are solid, possible that I missed something somewhere. :)<br />
<br />
First off, unless I'm mistaken, the AA mitigation line is not in effect during defensive, and the AA avoidance line is not in effect during evasive - archetype level of each is 10%, but I do not yet have a confirmed % boost of the PoP level extensions, or how they calculate into the combat equation - does the AA mitigation affect only DI, only DB, or both? also, is it an additive or multiplicative effect? Same with avoidance AA effect... With those numbers, I can add in computations for figuring out non-discipline &amp; non warrior hit spread/dps, and computations to determine where evasive or defensive would be more advantageous based on what average DImod someone is taking in hits from a mob.<br />
<br />
OK, math time - formulas are a combination of those in the Library thread and what I've been told/figured out on how mitigation components work, and reworked em to solve based on given information<br />
<br />
Basic Formulas and Definitions<br />
Set Y as DB Mitigation, Shielding as the % number (ie, 21 for 21% shielding), Innate as the innate class bonus mitigation as the % number (5 as far as I know), Y1=Mitigation with Spell boost, currently Vie is 10% boost<br />
<br />
Y=(100-Shielding-Innate)/100 <br />
<br />
This yields Y=0.74 for the above calculation<br />
<br />
Y1=Y*(100-Spell)/100<br />
<br />
This yields Y1=0.666<br />
<br />
Set Z as DI Mitigation, Defensive is currently 45%, Innate is 5% once again, as the innate 5% affects both DI and DB to my knowledge. Z1 is Mitigation with spell boost, currently Vie is 10%<br />
<br />
Z=(100-Discipline-Innate)/100<br />
<br />
This Yields Z=0.5 for defensive<br />
<br />
Z1=Z*(100-Spell)/100<br />
<br />
This yields Z1=0.45 for defensive+vie<br />
<br />
Now, using D1 for min damage, and D2 for the second step up, we have:<br />
<br />
DI= D2/Z-D1/Z for defensive numbers, or<br />
DI= D2/Z1-D1/Z1 for defensive+vie numbers<br />
<br />
Now that DI has been calculated,<br />
<br />
DB= (D1-(Z*DI))/Y for defensive numbers, or<br />
DB= (D1-(Z1*DI))/Y1 for defensive+vie numbers.<br />
<br />
<br />
Damage spreads are simply<br />
DMG = (Y*DB) + (Z*DI*X), where X = 1-20, for defensive spread<br />
DMG = (Y1*DB) + (Z1*DX), for defensive + vie spread.<br />
<br />
<br />
If anyone notices any errors, or has solid numbers on the pop component of mitigation/avoidance AAs and exactly how they relate in to DI/DB and mob's hit rates, please feel free to share or point me to them, only saw some rough discussion on the boards, nothing difinitive.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gorthag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hmmm... nevermind.... after doing some further appears that either mitigation AAs (CS+ID) either a) are always on, stacking with defensive, unlike I was told, or b) merely increase your chances of dropping to lower DI steps - went back through excel, turns out I had an error in the part that computed damage spreads when fed non-defensive hit numbers. :) Just need to figure out/find out the exact math on evasive now and spreadsheet will be set. :)</div></div><hr />
