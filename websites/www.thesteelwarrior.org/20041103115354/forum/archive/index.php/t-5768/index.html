<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Draganetti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">With the dawn of GoD comes an alchemy made, unstackable, thrown snare item.  Ensnaring Concoction III (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=51428)<br />
<br />
The range is very small (40 total), and you have to unequip your bow and turn off auto attack to use it.  It only lasts 5 tics and only 33% snare.  I suppose it's main purpose is to allow non-snaring classes to be able to snare a fleeing target at the end of a fight.  (REALLY wish they were stackable.)<br />
<br />
My question is, do you think it would provide another means for MT aggro at the top of a fight, as a cheap alternative to snare glands or forlorn staves?  Perhaps nothing else new is needed these days, but just a thought.  They are kindof a pain to use, and REALLY short range. . .may be very hard to time on inc, not sure.</div></div><hr />

it's 10 charges but it drops off the kobold king, so it's not like you need a full group or it's a long stressful camp. i picked one up just passing through.<br />

*edit* just realized you mentioned the staff...ignore me...nothing to see here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sulvar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">A guild shaman made up a ton of these potions so I have been fooling around with them.  I have yet to have the snare actually stick on a mob.  I can't say what the agro is on them cause I usually dont have probs anyway with agro on inc.  Just taunt with incite and a bow maybe and go to town.</div></div><hr />
