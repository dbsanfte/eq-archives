<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Roorni</div><div class="date">02-07-2004, 05:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I am a 53 warrior.  I usually group with a cleric, pally, and/or a beastlord.  I only have about 2000plat in the bank.  I know I need to update my armor just not sure what with.  I have been told I tank pretty well and usually manage to hold the aggro.  I have thought about doing the Twilight armor quest, but have been told it's not worth the time.  <br />
<br />
Should I try to start working on the Thurgadin armor?  Only been to Kael one time on raid...and we didn't stay long because it was taken.  Any help would be appreciated.  Thanks.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Partha</div><div class="date">02-07-2004, 07:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'll get here (hopefully) before a lot of people suggest a complete makeover. It's obvious that you've sunk time/money into a couple of spots, now you need to fill in. With that in mind -<br />
<br />
 Take your group up to Scarlet Desert and hit the Vas Ren camp. At least one of the drops out of there will be a Bracer of Defense (AC 15, STA 3, HP 20)<br />
<br />
 Sell that Bloodguard Soul Ring. I'm serious here. The stats are good, but for the money you can get for it, you can equip yourself with a pair of Velium Fire Wedding Rings (AC 6 HP 65 each), and a haste item on the order of a Flowing Black Silk Sash (22% haste) or a Silver Chitin Hand Wraps (21% haste and stats). Haste &gt; Stats at this point in your tanking career, and you'll be gaining 90 HP over what you have now.<br />
<br />
 These are initial ideas that your group can easily handle. I'm sure the others will be following on. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ahz</div><div class="date">02-07-2004, 07:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You have many choices.  I try to replace my weakest gear first. Anything you have that doesn't have 5 STA or 20 HPs is suspect.<br />
<br />
The Bloodguard ring, while having nice stats, is not so good for a warrior.   I agree with the previous poster about selling it, but for different reasons.  FBSS and 6/65 rings are very good.<br />
<br />
Thurgadin quest armor is nice, I wore a lot for a long time, and it provides nice upgrades to all your slots.  The drop rate is sucky, and there is much competition for it.  I'd be surprised if a non-twinked group of 55's could hold the arena for very long.  But it won't hurt to try it.  Take some friends to the Chanter House in Kael, the plate drops there a little more.<br />
<br />
If you can muster a group (or 2), and if you have good Skyshrine faction, try getting draconic pauldrons<br />
from WW.  If you can do it, it takes about an hour.<br />
<br />
Velks has some nice drops that include Crystal Spider Eyes, which would be a nice upgrade for you.  I think this zone could be good to you. Hit Allakhazam's and check Velks out.<br />
<br />
Otherwise, pick your weakest few spots and hit the bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kiya</div><div class="date">02-07-2004, 09:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As other said, sell your haste ring and pick up Silver chittin handwraps (22% haste) or Flowing black silk sash (21%) and a pair of velium fire rings (6ac, 65hp).  <br />
<br />
After you've saved up some plat and gotten some more levels, I'd think about upgrading your weapons to something a bit faster if dual wielding is going to be your main method of damage.  One that should not be terribly expensive would be a Frostbringer, which is decent aggro.  (I used mine for ages, heh.) <br />
<br />
As for your armor, a suit of thurgadin armor will hold you over for a long, long time.  If you would rather farm plat instead of rare drops and faction, take a look at Fine Heraldic armor.  (The unimbued human cultural armor.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Roorni</div><div class="date">02-08-2004, 06:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you all for the suggestions.  I actually spent very little money on what I have.  I was wearing my newbie armor quest stuff until like lvl 30, and friends in my guild gave me some hand-me-downs.  Think they were tired of my newbie armor...LOL.<br />
<br />
Also got lucky with the ring, I won it on my first adventure.  Have thought many times about selling it.  they go for around 12k on my server.  So I will be taking your suggestions and trying to get to the bazaar soon.  Or may ask a guildie to go for me...I can never move up there.<br />
<br />
Thanks again.</div></div><hr />
