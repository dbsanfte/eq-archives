<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slyson Dycson</div><div class="date">05-04-2003, 07:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1. Being Iksar has not made me less of a warrior than any other race.  I still have comparable AC to plate warriors, 1047 unbuffed at lvl 55, which is not bad considering I am not twinked and earned everything I own.  The only place being Iksar is a problem is lower levels where your gear is not as good as plate warriors.<br />
<br />
2. Later in the game, post lvl 46, the world opens up to you for armor.  PoH armor is great, Legionnaire Scale is better than Indicolite IMO.  Stats are more in line with what we need.  The AC is a bit less but you make up for it with your natural AC bonus.  You don't like PoH, try PoG armor, Iksar and plate war useable.  You both get the same AC from the armor, THEN you add on your bonus.  Same goes for the rest of the Velious armor.  The plate restriction appears again in Luclin as UP armor is not useable if I am thinking correctly.  With diety armor now, that is also a restriction, being Cazic worshiping only.  Granted FH is really nice to have, but just remember what people did before it came out.  That is what you would have to deal with.  Yes there is Cazic armor, but not worth the time or money to get it.  Pretty much anything else is fair game for armor.<br />
<br />
3. Finding armor in the beginnig is a bit difficult, which just means you need to be smarter.  You don't get the easy way out by getting crusty or cobalt like most people go for, or is it FH now, been to long since I was in this situation.  The Trooper Scale Armor quests will do just fine.  They are not to difficult and fairly decent.  My suit of it lasted me till I finally got some hate drops.<br />
<br />
4.  Exp penalty is the same as a Troll i beleive.  Not to sure as I never even knew there was a penalty when I first created my war and never cared once I found out about it.  Exp moves fine through the lower lvls and continues going fine for me in the higher lvls.  But don't let the penalty hold you back from making the choice to be Iksar.  The rewards are great once you get to the higher lvls.  Of course if you are going to be in elemental armor you are pretty much the same as everybody else, only you have higher regen.  If you're not going to be a power gamer, then you will be ahead of the rest of the non power gamers.<br />
<br />
Plus, you look badass, that is enough reason to be Iksar alone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sikrarn</div><div class="date">05-04-2003, 09:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Iksar warriors have got a bad rap everyone thinks they aren't very good at tanking which is way off. I am a lvl 59 iksar warrior as my main I used to play on prexus as a 60 dwarf warrior and I must say I like my Iksar warrior much better. This may seem odd for some but with the AC boost plus the regen and the looks are great. The armor doesn't play that big of a role in the long run you can wear the same stuff as any other warrior. once you get into the high end game you might have a little less hp but your AC will be above the others no prob. but don't take my word for it try for yourself you won't even notice the exp loss.<br />

And when choose right pair of weapons aggro isn't too prob to hold. Atm I use  Wavecrasher plus Frostbringer and they work nice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 I like my iksar warrior, both for his AC-bonus and the bad-ass looks we get :D <br />
 You get an exp penalty for being iksar (20% I think?), but get an exp bonus of 10% for being warrior. The penalty never really bothered me, I kept up with my friends just fine when levelling. <br />
<br />
 As Mokor said, biggest prob is people will expect you to have FD, even if you wear full plate armor and weild epics.....:rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<br />
OMG yes.......anyhow only drawback I found was lack of crusty and cobalt, but you find ways around it.  Once I could get to kael, it was all downhill from there.  just spend your newbie time in faction zones like Blackburrow, highpass, highkeep, crushbone, mistmoore, etc, and you will have plenty of places that will accept you.  You will look more badass then any other crowd, plus its a fraterity of the Legion.  Sometimes it comes in handy, I got a scythe of sundering simply because I was the only person on the raid that could equip.  the exp penelty only effects you if you do the math and figure what level you would be if you were a barb warrior.  Legionnaire scale is a bit rare to think about getting, but Thurg armor is darn nice and easy to get in your 50's when it matters.  I have been an iksar warrior since kunark came out and I can tell you my clerics would not have it any other way......oh yeah its all about the tail.  (ps skill &gt; race all the time)</div></div><hr />

Iksar warriors don't have the same selection of armour, as anyone else. However, high end armour can be worn by iksar. Other than that, they are as poor tank as any other warrior.<br />
2. No<br />
3. You don't need uber gear at low levels. Just focus on a good selection of low delay weapon to keep skills up.<br />
4. 20 %</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marshall</div><div class="date">09-29-2003, 09:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1. Is being an iksar warrior hurt your tanking in any way?<br />
No. Except that we get stunned during combat like any other non-ogre warrior. We don't have RZ as an option for deity which sucks.<br />
<br />
2. Is it going to matter in the later game if I am due to armor choices?<br />
No RZ so no fierce heraldic. But if your guild keeps raiding Kael or you have some money you can get good enough gear that can get you to 5500'ish hp at 65 with some hp AA's. Most of the good bazaar equipment is iksar wearable as well as no-drops. At lower levels you can wear sebilite scale armor or you can twink your little iksar with much better armor by killing coldain guards in the zone where dain is. In the end game all the best armor is iksar wearable, period.<br />
<br />
3. Am I going to be able to find decent armor in the beginning?<br />
Yes, see above.<br />
<br />
4. What's the penalty for being an iksar warrior? 20% just for iksar or is it decreased due to being a warrior?<br />
I never noticed this penalty although it does exist. Coordinating with friends and groupmates tells me that my exp bar moves normally like others. If I am getting 1 blue per kill then so are they, and so on. I think at level 60 the armor bonus is 40 AC (not sure). And our hp regen is so powa~<br />
<br />
How can we tell which gender you are?<br />
Iksar females have thin tales and they can be easily recognised with the luclin models.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jakle Attakle</div><div class="date">09-29-2003, 02:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1. No, being an iksar does not hurt tanking in any way. You can shrink for positioning if you choose to, people can usually spot you in a crowd, etc...<br />
<br />
2. It will matter to you in the later game if you do not:<br />
<br />
A) Join a raiding guild that can do High-Ssra level stuff or better.<br />
<br />
B) Play LDoN at all, or just enough to barely get armor.<br />
<br />
3. Your armor in the beginning is not that bad. It is not that easy, however, to upgrade from there until level 46ish. You get the trooper scale at first, then your next upgrades will be Legionnaire or Thurg. <br />
<br />
(if you can get lizard on Thurg faction, you can MQ a full set for them that will take you up until your 50's and 60's) <br />
<br />
A couple hours in the Platehouse in Kael with your lizard taking faction and looting stuff for MQ will do wonders for you.<br />
<br />
4. Your penalty is real. It hurts. It is decreased by being a warrior. Don't trust anyone to tell you exact percentages, as they cannot truly be trusted.<br />
<br />
IMPORTANT!!! The only person who will be hurting as an iksar warrior (happens to be me HA HA)<br />
<br />
Someone who loves to tank higher stuff but doesnt want a raiding guild.<br />
<br />
Someone who cannot get access to tons of Platinum to buy ornate, etc...<br />
<br />
Someone who cannot devote tons of time to playing for AA's, etc...<br />
<br />
LDoN has normalized play for level 65 iksars who just dont want to join raiding guilds (IF THEY PLAY A LOT)<br />
<br />
P.S. one of my biggest gripes about trying to stay up with the joneses as a casual player trying to keep my lizard in front of the big mobs was cultural armor.<br />
<br />
This has been somewhat negated by LDoN armor. Just realize that you will have to get to level 65 and be able to crank out the points to get it :)<br />
<br />
LDoN Miragul's 760 armor is comparable or better than Fierce Heraldic. So one or two adventures a day for 10 days will net you a new piece at level 65. This is a good thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sutas Mu</div><div class="date">09-29-2003, 02:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">LDoN Player Made Armors (http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=9680&amp;menustr=080100280000) might be a good place to start looking for gear for a young iksar warrior, however I do not know the going rate on them.  Our armor choices end game are pretty much the same as anyone elses, the only hurt being our lack of good cultural armor.  LOL forget not having Rallos Zek armor, I would settle for having plate cultural at all.  At the very least I would be happy if they put iksar on the Erudite CT tailored stuff...<br />
<br />
On the subject of the experience penalty, I have only noticed it twice in my career... at level 59 and level 64.  Both times I was grouped with an assling druid who was gaining XP noticeably faster.  So afterwards I went to Misty thickett and killed all the newbie merchants and that made me feel better.  The XP penalty exists but it is nothing to worry about.  The AC bonus and the 18 per tick unbuffed standing regen you will have at level 65 more than make up for it.<br />
<br />
Don't worry about your faction either.  There are only two races in Everquest: Iksar and cattle.  Cattle are just there to be slaughtered, so kill everything everywhere outside of Cabilis and don't look back.  Embrace being KoS.<br />
<br />
Does being an iksar hurt my tanking?  Not at all.  I take damage as well as any of the cattle warriors.<br />
<br />
As an iksar warrior I am warmly to Cazic-Thule (doesn't make any difference in any aspect of the game but it is kinda fun)<br />

<br />
50 ac in the end is nice along with the regen, but that doesn't make a huge difference. There's also the fact that most armor is ALL/ALL and Plate Classes/ALL in the end, so it really doesn't make a HUGE difference with the armor problems.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
i.e. play what you want to play. Race doesn't make that big of a difference.  You'll hurt a bit in the beginning because of a half assed attempt to make warriors non-plate users because of their ac component, but it's not that noticeable at the higher end. Most of the higher end plate is war/all, so you'll still be able to wear what ogres wear. :)<br />
<br />
Check my magelo for things that you can wear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zynth</div><div class="date">09-30-2003, 06:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i totally love my iksar warrior, from what i've noticed since i've made my iksar warrior, only the people who are iksar finatics are the ones that really make it far, due to the exp penility. i have a dark elf clerics and from lvl 50-60 he got a noticably better exp % from each kill than i did. also once pop came out i noticed the other warrior around me gained exp and made it to 65 alot faster than i did. but i'm pretty sure AAs sail at the same rate for all races.<br />
<br />
i've never been twinked, i started this very character on a pvp server long before bazaar was even a though and to this day i wont buy some thing i cant camp. having said that the armor selection sucked, but lucky for you, now there is lots of armor available to iksars now, you just have to know where to look for it. after lvl 50 most of the warrior armor is ALL races so that wont really be a big problem, the biggest problem i had was getting groups with my crappy armor and agro. but like i said, there's more stuff avialable now to make it easier for you. the AC bonus can help out to an extent, i have more AC than any other warrior in my guild. i was actaully able to break 1500ac before lvl 60 and before luclin with full hate armor. <br />
<br />
as far as tanking, every iksar warrior i know is the MT of their guild, including myself, of course, in my case i like to belive it's because i'm also one of the raid leaders in my guild and i make most of the stratages for my guild using the knowledge of the individual abilities of my guild mates, as well as being very learned in the ways of mob placement. but that may just may be my ego :D <br />
<br />
as for question 5 6 and 7, using the old models, females naked have a more colorful stomach and a colorful pattern on their head, but even while clothed you'll notice iksar females have HUGE eyes, where males have spikes on the sides of their heads. if you use the luclin modles, iksar males have spikes on their arms, and the females have a bow legged stance and look to be some what crouching. no it doesnt make a differance, and YES it's AAAAAAALL about the tail, tail = sexy, kitties arent as sexy because they have a tiny thin tail while iksar have a huge meaty tail, and we all know that size *does* matter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dakatsu</div><div class="date">09-30-2003, 01:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I found in the the Trooper Scale quest armor great for my warrior early on, it lasted well until I was able to reach PoH. Then the Lego gear took over and lasted well into the upper 50's. The exp penalty is 20% take away 5 for being a warrior. Will it matter in the end? nope! With all warriors it is the person behind the tune that counts. If you wanna be a bad ass Iksar warrior and your enthusiasm for the toon drives you to be a better warrior then so much better for the people you group with. It comes down to what makes you happy. I think IKSARS rock personally, so you have my vote for Iksar Warrior.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The gear restrictions are basically meaningless, the only real drawback being the lack of good cultural armor, but that's a problem you can run into with plenty of other race/deity combos also.  The AC bonus is nice, the regen is nice, the xp penalty isn't too noticable, plus you get to be somewhat unique.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sukrn</div><div class="date">10-02-2003, 02:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1. Is being an iksar warrior hurt your tanking in any way?<br />
<br />
<br />
No, Leezard &gt; *<br />
<br />
<br />
2. Is it going to matter in the later game if I am due to armor choices?<br />
<br />
No, the armour restrictions went out the window long ago, the only bump in the road would be achieving Kunark era armour aka Cobalt, we cant wear it.  However due to the vast range of gear available one can make do until you gain access to Velious armour.  Also Leezard &gt; *<br />
<br />
3. Am I going to be able to find decent armor in the beginning?<br />
<br />
Yes, but how decent depends on your budget.  I might add, you have two choices in cultural armour, those being<br />
1) crap<br />
2) crap<br />
<br />
4. What's the penalty for being an iksar warrior? 20% just for iksar or is it decreased due to being a warrior?<br />
<br />
The iksar penalty is the same as trolls, 20% I *think* its something around that mark anyways.  It prolly is a little different for Iksar warriors due to the warrior xp bonus.  Something else to think about is Leezard &gt; *<br />
<br />
5. How can we tell which gender you are?<br />
<br />
Bad attempt at leezard makeup on the female models.  The male leezard models sorta strut... ^_^  Also, it doesn't matter if the lesser races can't tell the difference, the bottom line is, leezard &gt; *<br />
<br />
6. Does it make a difference anyhow?<br />
<br />
Also, it doesn't matter if the lesser races can't tell the difference, the bottom line is, leezard &gt; *<br />
<br />
7. Is it really &quot;all about the tail?&quot;<br />
<br />
It was all about the tail, but then the cats showed up, so now its more about the scales.  :D</div></div><hr />
