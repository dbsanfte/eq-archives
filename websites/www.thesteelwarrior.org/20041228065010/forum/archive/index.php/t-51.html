Hi, I'm dual boxing with a druid (53rd) and having trouble keeping agro. <br />
<br />
I am currently using a weighty Polearm. And it does ok, but I still have problems with agro often.<br />
<br />
Should I look at getting my dex up (how high?) and go with 2 1hs with higher agro?<br />
<br />
What are good (cheap &lt; 500pp) agro weapons. <br />
<br />
I'm getting votes on the Black Blade of Tormenting for about 350.<br />
Then Barnical Covered Axe if I can find one for cheap<br />
Praetors Blade of Depility quest<br />
Kunzar Ku'juch - might be good since my druid wouldn't have to snare (as much)<br />
Silken Whip of Ensnaring - another possibility (if I can go up to 1kish)<br />
<br />
Thanks for all the info everyone!</div></div><hr />

I have no real knowledge of the BCA, as it came out after I passed that level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kahomn</div><div class="date">04-17-2003, 12:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been duel boxing Warrior / druid for like a year now. The only time my druid gets agro is when i have more than 1 pull.  But normally,  I can land 3 dots, and a heal without stealing agro.. i leave snare as the last spell to cast since it does no damage, and doesn't contribute to the actual killing, just saves you from chasing the mob, so when the mob gets down to 30% life, then you snare.  It all comes down to tactics. i had junk weapons till i was 60 when i got Frosty and that isn't so great but made my life easier.  A lvl 53 druid doesn't have good heals for a warrior, When my druid was -58 i had a hell of time keeping agro off the druid ( Tunare Renewal is 1 cast where Superior healing is 6 casts.. and can you say agro magnet ?  I don't know what level you are, nor what gear you possess. If you really want the combo to work, go solo the druid till you get the new heal spell and come back and PL the warrior safely... druids can excel faster... My druid is now 61 and i will take her over some clerics i know (not gonna mention i have pocket epic cleric but...)<br />
<br />
Like said, it comes down to what you are making your druid do. Are you nuking and healing? or dotting/healing. Dotting is less agro and over the time it take you to melee to 50% mobs life. the dots will add up another 25-30% (with your damage shield).<br />
<br />
I am 65 and i still lose agro when a groupmate decides to be a hero.. and i wield CHSD, Red Epic, and TSBS (when in POP) and most my stats are 200+ when hunting. (just love how men feel they are better that woman.)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aurthur</div><div class="date">04-18-2003, 01:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The stats may not be that great now-a-days, but the proc from Yakesha items are still pretty decent (dd+minor pushback).  The club, sword, throneblade are all relatively inexpensive...  some necro's use them as pet weapons for taunt/proc's.</div></div><hr />
