<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sangiovese</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hopefully this can get moved to the Outhouse where it belongs... complaining about a contested spawn in Ssra really doesn't fit in with the &quot;Elemental Planes and Plane of Time&quot; setting on this board.<br />
<br />
With that said, there are usually two sides to every story.<br />
<br />
Here is the other side of this one.<br />
<br />
Guild A (represented by Proteg) and Guild B (the cockblockers) both started moving to Ssra at the same time.<br />
<br />
Guild B managed to zone members in, form up, buff, kill XtC, lotto the drops, rebuff, and move to HP before Guild A ever got a sufficient force in place to engage HP.  So much for &quot;first in force.&quot;<br />
<br />
Guild B then WAITED for Guild A to take their shot.<br />
<br />
As for springing the trap... Guild A must have done that to themselves, because guild B was waiting a couple rooms back.<br />
<br />
And the eyes... those were the result of 40 guild B people sitting there fully buffed and ready to go, bored out of their skulls for 20 minutes waiting for Guild A to engage.  Perhaps if Guild A would have ignored the eyes instead of chasing them around trying to stab them, Guild A would have been ready sooner?<br />
<br />
Eventually, after waiting for much longer than first come first serve etiquette requires, Guild B told Guild A to engage the mob or we would.<br />
<br />
At this point Guild A engages and wipes.  Guild B waited for the mob to be reset with no aggro (back up to 100% HP) before moving in.  At no point during the fight was there anyone from guild B in the HP room (except for non aggro eyes, to watch the fight).  <br />
<br />
Accept a failed attempt without trying to blame it on another guild who was waiting.  You weren't trained... your shot wasn't interfered with.  You failed.  It happens.<br />
<br />
As for the Norge Tal &quot;almost rotting.&quot;  Guild B uses a points system and also has active and inactive members.  People with enough points are allowed to lotto in a certain order (active with enough points, then inactive with enough points, then blah blah blah....).  A warrior in attendance has wanted that axe since he was created.  The warrior didn't have enough points to go in on the lotto right away.  His friends in the guild wanted him to have it, so they stayed out and let the lotto system wind its way down thru the tiers until it got to &quot;active members willing to go negative.&quot;  At that point, the lucky warrior sent the lotto coordinator a tell and claimed his axe.  Point systems aren't always just about the points.<br />
<br />
As you can tell by my post in the Bunker (called Norge Tal)... I was pretty excited about winning the axe, especially for an item that &quot;nobody really wanted, but eventually some guy looted.&quot;<br />
<br />
So there is an opposing view.  Like I said... one story, two sides.<br />
<br />
As for this:This same guild in question is one of three that I know of that is currently cockblocking the Emp in SSRA.<br />
We've killed the emperor a grand total of four times.  June 11th was our first kill.  We then got him on July 10th and 11th (hooray patch!) as part of our big push for VT.  (July 15th was our first VT raid)  We recently killed him again on 8/7 to get rifts for new members.  If killing him an average of once a month to get our members keyed for VT is &quot;cockblocking&quot; then I guess we're guilty.<br />
<br />
If you would like to discuss it further Proteg, send me a PM and I will be happy to talk about what happened in Ssra.  But I don't think it needs to be dragged out any further here.<br />
<br />
EDIT:  Addressed quoted script about cockblocking the emp.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Battleblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">There are usually 6 sides to every story. I figure he was asking what to do -<br />
<br />
Some guilds mobize faster than others. Some guilds leave if they see an adequate force assembled to take out a spawn, others sit a couple of rooms away or race to do first damage. Some compromise (that means everybody gets something, not one guild gets every thing) and some don't.<br />
<br />
IF this seriously bothers your guild and they feel they MUST do something about it there are many strategies - but first, try to make an arangement. If a reasonable compromise can't be reached - Find an important mob to the competing guild and permacamp it. Good mobs are the FG (or any other key camp) shard camp or any required Planar flag mob. Kill the Taskmasters reqularly to mess up the spawn. Make progress in the game without compromise impossible.<br />
<br />
While most guilds and servers resist a formal rotation, some method of sharing usually emerges among higher level guilds.<br />
<br />
Complaining is usually taken as a sign of weakness.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>duppolfg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">How in the world do you deal with a guild (or guilds) that cockblock? <br />
<br />
In Emperor Ssrakasdfk2+2=4 case, you would wait for patch day, and sit at his port in room till blood spawns. Yes, it takes a long time, and yes you will miss other spawns. But you will get your chance most likely and you will also get VT keys if you beat him.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Aeryl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It's pretty funny that Sangiovese is throwing stuff in there that Proteg never mentioned while in his defensive scramble to justify being in a guild full of dickheads.  Sitting on someone's ass waiting for them to succeed or fail is just lame, no matter what reasons or justifications you can come up with.  Go do something else.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hmm.... what did I add that wasn't in response to something Proteg said?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
And you were able to discern this all the way from the Xegony server how?<br />
<br />
I'm really interested in how you are able to conclude decisively who was right and wrong here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kiya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If they leave &quot;engaging_guild_02&quot; alone while it has its shot, waiting behind them is not lame.  Better to wait a while than to have a spawn blown.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Daramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Not that HP is blowable, in the slightest. It's one thing to vulture Creator, where a fail is going to be hours of twiddling your thumbs for the next guy. HP is a different story, still, it sounds like they didn't do anything wrong there. A guild asks for a shot, they got a shot, they failed. If they want an uncontested try at a mob multiple times without any conflict, they need to move to Legends.</div></div><hr />

And Dar, I presume you mean Cursed, not Creater.  Creater isn't blowable.</div></div><hr />
