i once saw a listing of the relitive difficulty of LDON raids. anyone know/remember how tough they are?<br />
<br />
my guild is kinda pre-EP(most missing 1 mob for solro, then just RZ for EP), but on off days, i'd like to run an LDON raid for the heck of it.</div></div><hr />

Takish and Rujark are supposed to be approximately Vex Thal level, and Mistmoore is approximately Elemental level. That said, the Rujark script really, really, really hurts(but is kinda cool), and the MM script contains the worst.. idea.. EVER. I will pop a cyanide cap before I drag my guild through Mistmoore again. We never did Takish, Rujark and Mistmoore convinced us that LDON would never e worth it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Busstin1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">We did the time level EC raid , Wow it was hard cause the mobs keep running and getting their friends if there is less than 3 goblins in camp or something, Still won but the loots are not up to par if you ask me. Got like 3-4 loots out of chest at the end most had about 100hp  :eek: <br />
<br />
<br />
P.S. i dont know how they call it time Equivilent when the loots are only 100hp haha</div></div><hr />
