Collective Assault (http://cassault.com) is looking for 3 WARRIORS to add to our family... I am our only warrior atm, it hasn't been a class of high priority until now, my 2nd and 3rd assist quit therefore i'm using pal/sk offtanks with their 8-9k unbuffed hp, If we had 2 or 3 more warriors with 8500-10k unbuffed that'd help alot on some of the encounters we are currently doing. (its really not fun having defensive or evasive down or low endurance when i'm needing to tank a 2nd named in a row for my guild. It slows us down and is tiring)<br />
<br />
Other classes are not really required at this time, some exceptions may be made if the player and char are outstanding. We are open for picking up 1 of each class though, so if you have a family member, or spouse etc... That would be thinking about this they can come with. Our server has groups 24hours normally and is pretty thriving.<br />
<br />
Current requirements are lvl 68+ and atleast 100AA points.<br />
Ideally they will be flagged up to elementals and/or KT (getting someone flagged for kt isn't hard at all.)<br />
<br />
Raids start at 8:30est and normally end when we run out of people (normally around 2am est), You are *NOT* penalized for missing them because we feel that RL should ALWAYS be a first priority. We'll be in Qvic/Time pretty soon at the rate things are going, currently we farm all that we can outta GoD (ageless relic protector, pixtt suir mindrider, pixtt grand summoner, ikkinz1, 2 and 3), clear out fire/water/earth/b weekly - Due to our server having several guilds under us in progression, and a few barely over us in progression the content we are currently farming is rarely if ever contested.  We have been a guild on the server approx 8 months, while every other guild currently there above us in progression has been around 4+ years.  We have monthly guild events like druken gnome runs, guild best of the best, iksar olympics, ogre obstacle course and many others for dkp/platinum/rare prizes (amulet of necropotence, holgresh elder beads, dathor hammer etc..) Also if you have to log before a raid ends, its also not a big deal, you get dkp for the time you spent there, or 3/4 of what everyone else is getting.<br />
<br />
Main goals are we want you to see new things, meet new people, get better gear, and have *FUN* while doing it.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you're interested and meet the requirements, please feel free to apply at: pub117.ezboard.com/bcamessageboard <br />

ps. You can close this post so people responding doesn't bump it to the top, as we all know guild recruitment threads are annoying to see every 2 minutes.</div></div><hr />
