dbotw <br />
symbol of the planesmaster (if you dont have ahr gaunts and if its not too expensive)<br />
Silver hoop of speed<br />
prismatic ring of resistance or band of primordial energy or veil of the inferno<br />
<br />
basically their effects make them so valueable since we have better stats on god items...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">05-12-2004, 07:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Demorgoth pretty much hit it on the head.<br />
<br />
One thing to be careful about is to avoid items you will replace. Not only will you be wasting DKP if you are in a DKP guild, but you'll have the pleasure of augmenting the new gear. Ring of Force looks pretty decent at first glance, but not only are there better rings in PoTime but also Glyphed Prayer Ring is not difficult to obtain in GoD.<br />
<br />
Don't bid on Raex legs only to replace them with Greaves of Furious Might and then wish you had waited for Jointed Scale Greaves.<br />
<br />
Don't replace your Raex helm in PoTime if you believe serious progression in GoD isn't that far off - Vadd's Helm of Elite Combat rocks. If this is practical for you, you might concider Arms of the Brute should Faerune be an effect you want to keep.<br />
<br />
Every item Demogoth listed is either best in game or close enough that you will not be replacing it for a very long time. Lower priority than the items he listed I'd add Earring of Corporeal Essence, Platinum Cloak of War, and Necklace of Eternal Visions - not in the same league as the other items listed but worthy.<br />
<br />
I think haste may be the biggest conumdum you'll face. There's a tendancy to put up with either 40% haste (Earring of Corporeal Essence) or an inferior item in a slot just because it has more haste. I may be wrong, but the best choice may be Shroud of Survival (haste)/Girdle of Intense Durability or  Cord of Temporal Weavings (haste)/Pauldrons of Devastation.<br />

BP &amp; DBoW are nice, but nothing compares to 45ac 185 extra hp <br />
that will probably be with you for ever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">05-12-2004, 08:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can't totally disagree - the best is the best. But a reasonable although inferior substitute is Visor of the Berserker/Band of Primordial Energy. Raex BP and DBoW are &quot;good enough&quot; that I can't see myself being eager to replace them and replacements/near substitutes aren't readily available.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dubb</div><div class="date">05-12-2004, 08:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Interesting, I would've expected to see Band of Primordial Energy rated higher. The 'form of' benefits don't stack with each other, but 54ac clicky is hard to overlook.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battleblade</div><div class="date">05-12-2004, 08:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Which raises two related questions in my mind:<br />
<br />
1. Since several items take up a valuable buff slot and some don't stack, which are most desireable self-buff items in order of desirability?<br />
<br />
2. If you could have only one Quarm loot, which would you want?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">minet</div><div class="date">05-12-2004, 09:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">intristing you rate symbol so high , i think of the 15 or so that we have had drop ( guess) only 2 went to warriors<br />
<br />
imo in order of importance,, what i would * save* dkp for<br />
<br />
DBotwl number 1<br />
<br />
why because its mutch rarer than bp molds<br />
<br />
<br />
1 DB<br />
2 raex bp<br />
3 silver hoop of speed<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
now asuming u can get more than 1 quarm item i would rate priority on those at<br />
<br />
silver hoop<br />
shroud of eternity<br />
bracer of fortitude<br />
belt<br />
<br />
why--- earing ,, hard to match the ac hp and effect of this earing to date<br />
<br />
shroud .. all all item , ive seen this go to enchanters 4% shield mod  only reaspn this isnt first is there is alot of back items in game and thus this would be less contested as the earing<br />
<br />
bracer all around good tank item ,, i been really getting into stun mod items as of late ,, lower on list as it would be less contested than the ear and shorud<br />
<br />
belt - nice belt , but not as benificial as above.<br />
<br />
the Form of X items ,, veil or ring , <br />
<br />
ring is closer to  current endgame stats tjhan veil ,, lots of rings drop in GoD and theres alot of veils out there to buy for cheep.<br />
<br />
veils ac just sux but the hps 180 i think , is hard to beat as a clicky<br />
<br />
i can see the veil turning into a clicky bag item long before the ring   But thats whats nice about these 2 items is that u can always have them as clickys<br />
<br />
IF i had a choice i think i would go for the ring in a dkp enviroment ,, because the veil will be very contested,, so buy the ring cheep and save dkp for something else</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shakkha</div><div class="date">05-12-2004, 09:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Darkblade...<br />
<br />
No other weapon found yet that can match it...<br />
<br />
<br />
Then as Vadd gloves are out i would say Veil of the Inferno and Quarm Ring if we want a fourth item i would prolly say Symbol of the Planemasters as other said only if you don't have AHR gloves really... The effect is nice to have ;-)<br />
<br />
The rest is nearly already obsolete with GoD loots...<br />
<br />
Years of Eq have tought me, gear gets upgraded but right clicks stay ;-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">thundersam</div><div class="date">05-12-2004, 09:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Agree with Minet here, my list would be like this :<br />
1.Darkblade: This thing owns, by far best weapon in the game, and alot rarer than bps as said.<br />
2.bp<br />
3.Inferno veil<br />
4.q ear <br />
5.q ring<br />
<br />
Reason i wouldnt take band of primodal energy is because it dont stack with veil, nor q ring, but veil do stack with q ring so imo it gets an easy desision.<br />
Id rather get the p3 mask and put veil in bag for clicky if i had enough points on that and got the other most pri items.<br />
<br />
Else the items i would get from time considering quality and price( if your on dkp) is as following in no specific order: rz cloak (nice ac 10 avoidance, cheap alternative to q cloak) tz ring (good ac stats and 10 combat effects, great for aggro),tz orb ( not the best ac but 10 avoidance and cheap), qbelt (best belt in game, good stats and effect also of the cheaper q items), Q bracer( pretty own  bracer, uber hp shielding mod etc and not too expenssive), eoe (really good offhander, and cheap), tt arms(rather cheap and nice spellshielding on it)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do not understimate the power of the &quot;clicky&quot;.<br />
Every STAT based item gets banked/destroyed.<br />
(That will apply to DBoW &amp; Raex BP etc etc etc etc)<br />
<br />
Almost all clicky we have found so far still remain usefull.<br />
A good clicky will outlive 99% of your current equipement.<br />
<br />
Clicky not affected by stacking (Player Buffs) are a HUGE plus.<br />
<br />
If i had to do it all over again i would bank for 2 items : Quarm Ring &amp; Bertox Mask.<br />
Once these 2 are done, i'd take whatever pleases me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dima</div><div class="date">05-12-2004, 10:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">2. If you could have only one Quarm loot, which would you want?<br />

<br />
A tough choice. I'd personally hit up the shroud, because i'm a shielding whore :o</div></div><hr />

 R z 1h no doubt, far best aggro, the faster and better aggro i have the faster mod get killed which again reduces the chances of me beeing killed. (im aggro whore :p )</div></div><hr />

but i believe it has been said that  rz ring ( form of ) and quarm ring Stack,, in a similiar fashion to how veil and ring stack ,, just modified aplication.<br />
with that said , i stand by my top 3 picks but maby adjust my quarm picks puting <br />
ear<br />
back<br />
ring<br />
belt.<br />
<br />
and same deal with the form of decision ,, veil vs ring .. chose the cheeper dkp of the 2 .. being ring<br />
<br />
<br />
edit to q list :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Coroq</div><div class="date">05-12-2004, 11:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, some good points here. I know Minet just said that these effects stack in a way, but I'm not sure what that means. So looking up the rings and masks on Lucy shows<br />
<br />
Name, who can use, (slot) and description of right click buff<br />
Quarm ring = Prismatic Ring of Resistance, all except int casters, (1) +15 resist all (10) +45 AC<br />
RZ ring = Band of Primordial Energy, all, (6) Screech1 (10) +54 AC<br />
Bert mask = Veil of the Inferno, all, (5) +180 HP (6) Screech1<br />
<br />
Can anybody with more than 1 of these confirm whether you can have any 2 (or even all 3) of these effects going in your buff box at once? I'm guessing that the slot 6 Screech(1) effect is just a dummy thing to prevent stacking? I also guess that Quarm ring effect will stack with Bert mask effect? Of course if you can have 2 buffs up at once, the next question is, do you reap the sum of all their benefits?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for sharing your knowledge :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raaj</div><div class="date">05-12-2004, 11:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Im sure quarm/bertox stack, but the AC on the RZ buff+Quarm buff were both slot10,so they wont.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EmiliaEQ</div><div class="date">05-12-2004, 12:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Veil of The Inferno : +180 HP<br />

5:  Increase Max Hitpoints by 180 <br />
6:  Screech(1) <br />

<br />
Veil + Prismatic should stack since there is no conflict between them<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/stacking.html?id=3631&amp;source=Live<br />
<br />
Veil &amp; Energy should not the Screech (1) should prevent it.<br />
And i doubt Prismatic + Energy will stack , they both add AC on Slot 10<br />
(We have any examples of buff with the same attribute in the same slot stacking ?)<br />
<br />
We got 1 Quarm ring in like 15 Kills ... <br />
So i took RZ one, but i'm not gonna hesitate 1 second if i can grab Veil + Quarm.<br />
Its worth Every DKP you have.<br />
<br />
You loot 2 items, but in reality you looted 3 ....<br />
32ac 185hp<br />
30ac 210hp<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">minet</div><div class="date">05-12-2004, 01:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the rz ring and quarm ring stacking issue was brought to the board a while ago , a shammy posted.<br />
<br />
and he had mentioned that if one was casted before the outher , in a specific order they would stack , but not outherwise.<br />
<br />
now after posting this watch it get changed.  :P<br />
<br />
also clickys are great but it is anouther buff slot that would outherwise goto resists/attack/DS or similiar. <br />
<br />
in group or mild raids this is not an issue, but stricter play may not be as tolerent.<br />
<br />
im sure there is one amongst us that can prove or disprove this with first hand experience</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aonodorus</div><div class="date">05-13-2004, 12:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally I'd prefer the RZ ring to the bertox mask, with Faceguard of Frenzy as your alternative mask, but that's just because coming out of potime, you'll be more concerned with your armor class and combat modifiers like Shielding, Avoidance, and Spell Shielding, than you will be with your hitpoints.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">XAclylospradaX</div><div class="date">05-14-2004, 10:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We got lucky with Q rings, had about 5 Q kills and one dropped everytime. Being that the RZ ring is all/all and we have only have a few in about 20+ kills made me lean towards Q ring. Bert mask also doesn't like to drop for us, so I picked up FoF, and grabbed a Q ring, which I don't regret one bit.<br />
<br />
We just recently &quot;opened&quot; up the one Q loot policy, so far I'm leaning towards either Earring or Bracer.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for desired loots in time...<br />
<br />
Dbotwl (we only have 2 but..of course who wouldn't want one...)<br />
Belt of Stabilty or Q belt<br />
Q ear<br />
Shroud of Eternity<br />
Neck of Eternal Visions or Collar of Catostrophe</div></div><hr />

and if you start out with Form of Defense, <br />
then Eternal Ward won't stick.<br />

Of course it must be a mistake, that <br />
Form of Defense and Eternal Ward don't stack, <br />
