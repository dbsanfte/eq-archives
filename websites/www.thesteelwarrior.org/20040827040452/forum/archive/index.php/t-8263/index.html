<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Frodlin7th</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Since the older channel (serverwide.thesteelwarrior) has basically turned into a cesspool, and since there exists a need for a good warrior channel which is a source of information and comraderie rather than a source of ridicule, and immaturity,  I've started a newer, more friendly serverwide warrior channel.<br />
<br />
/join serverwide.steelwarrior:steelwarrior<br />
<br />
<br />
There's certain rules in this channel which are NOT up for negotiation:<br />
<br />
1. Attacking people based on their level of progression in the game will get you booted, period.<br />
<br />
2. Any attempt to start, or organize &quot;jihads&quot; or attacks on other channels and you'll be booted, period, and not welcome back in.<br />
<br />
3. If someone asks a question, and you have the answer, dont' be a jerk, answer it.    This doesnt' necessarily apply to certain encounter strats.<br />
<br />
4. Mod powers will be granted to warriors only, period.   Former warriors, future warriors do not apply, dont' even bother asking.  If you're not a warrior, you're not a mod.<br />
<br />
5. Modding the channel for innane reasons to make immature announcements or to flex your authority will be cause for the removal of mod powers.<br />
<br />
6. Multi-line ASCII hotkeys, while cute, are nonetheless discouraged.<br />
<br />
7. Heated discussions about hot topics related to EQ will occur, and are to be expected.   From time to time, I'll inquire about hot topics, such as &quot;the list&quot; to present on Sony Forums.<br />
<br />
8. Racism, and Anti-Seimitism will not be tolerated, period.<br />
<br />
9. Members of other classes are welcome into the channel, members of jihads to the channel will be instabooted, and kept that way.   <br />
<br />
I'll be looking for people to make mods, if you're interested, send me a tell in game.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>DRGNUSMC</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Quick question....what is jihads?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Baadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">That's when people get together and storm another channel and say/do stupid crap while there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shikarii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">spend 10 min in the other channel and you'll see a jihad..<br />
<br />
( jihad = A crusade or struggle against something or other. usually with the internet it's a spammage and nonstop attempt at making a point of sorts against something totally irrelevant and stupid )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>DRGNUSMC</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">k Thank you.  Looking forward to the channel so that I can become a better tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kadah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Can I be a mod Fro~<br />
Yeah I know ths isnt in game but hey ^^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>bardeil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Good call Frodlin. I finally got sick of the bullshit and removed tsw:tsw from my autojoin list altogether. I have readded your new channel and hope for the best. <br />
<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Get your ops taken away, and see what happens!<br />
<br />
Original TSW was fine, people just realized that you can't constantly talk about warriors all the time. Guess Ridefort can't have ops too?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>XAclylospradaX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">frodlin is a great man!<br />

and ninjaburger-....ridefort becomes a honarary @ !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Good job Frodlin.  And I would suggest you start out with a perma-ban on Ninjaburger :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Mikemac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">This sounds great.  I am a newbie and will, therefore, follow my gramma's advice:  Listen twice as much as you talk; that's why you have two ears and only one mouth.  (She said obscure things like that).  I obviously have no knowledge to impart and much to learn, so I will certainly make out on this deal.<br />
<br />
Although I know that I can learn from my own mistakes, I would rather learn from yours.  JK.  I would rather have someone say:  Watch your step, around that corner is the Bottomless Pit of Doom and Eternal Damnation, as opposed to falling in it myself.<br />

I also tried to get Haass in for a heated debate, but he kindly passed..</div></div><hr />
