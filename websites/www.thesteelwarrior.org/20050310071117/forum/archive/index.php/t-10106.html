<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frig Coldheart</div><div class="date">12-25-2004, 11:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heya guys, I play on Luclin and have since I started playing EQ almost 4 years ago. Recently one of the higherend guilds from Stormhammer moved to Luclin, (Township Rebellion). I have never played on SH mainly because of the added cost per month and I have alot friends where I am at already. I was wondering what the advantages are supposed to be of being on SH. I mean there has to be something extra to justify the cost I would think. Was just wondering what these are.</div></div><hr />

No need to worry about racing other guilds for mobs.  you get to check out new zones before released to live servers.  some zones that are never gonna go live.  other then that i can think of anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zerapheus</div><div class="date">12-26-2004, 01:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There used to be advantages to being on Stormhammer.  Now there are none.  The server is almost totally dead.  There are no high-end guilds - most that are left are at Elemental stage.  CS there can be good, but with an almost minimal playerbase, prepare to spend a mass amount of time LFG unless you have friends or a guild there.</div></div><hr />

They dropped the ball big time on this server. <br />
<br />
I played there for over a year with Defiant Exodus(great buch of folks BTW), and other than the free reign on contested mobs, there was little benefit in the service. It was a wonderful sales pitch they made, and the first few months they actually had dedicated GM's. Now SH is thrown into the India mix with everyone else. I'm not sure if they get faster responses because of the extra cost, but it isn't like when the server opened anymore. It is an experiment that didn't work, and SoE is milking it for all it's worth ATM.<br />
<br />
3:1 subscription costs is lucrative. I did get into the EQ2 beta, and I'd like to thank SoE for saving me the $50 to try a game I didn't care for. Nice perk. :cool: <br />
<br />
I especially like how EQ2 gets all the web services we were supposed to get, but have been broken since day one. That spelled the end for me more than a few uber guilds leaving. It's quite insulting when you look at it from a paying stand-point.<br />
<br />
Now I'm giving Blizzard my monthly entertainment $. It's more fun so far, but I'm a  casual player by nature.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think SH was a test for what EQ2 was going to be. And after EQ2 got into beta SH died.<br />
<br />
Don't throw away your money. Stay where you are or go try a new MMOG.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sargeras</div><div class="date">12-26-2004, 09:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">From what I understood it to be, SH had the priority customer service, the reoccuring GM events, and the opportunity to have better interaction in the game....... basically everything that was promised to everyone when EQ went live. One thing was better items dropping in the same zones as the non-legends zones but you would never see them anywhere other than SH, and I believe there was something about the first person to loot it had the item named after him/her.<br />
<br />
Instead, the high-end guilds were forced into a GM-enforced spawn rotation (I remember the ultimatum that TR sent to Sony that they were no longer abiding by it due to supposed favoritism for their competitors), testing and retesting of revamped zones before they went live, and poor implementation of promised CS to their higher paying customers. Legends eventually came to be the expensive way to server transfer with all your gear intact. Say you wanted to go from Fennin Ro to Povar, so you'd pay for a transfer from FR -&gt; SH, then SH -&gt; Povar. Of course this was before the actual straight-to-server-with-all-equipment deal.<br />

Veeshan has recently seen an influx of Legends characters applying to CD. You can tell where they are from because their name has a title from partaking in some event or quest from Legends.</div></div><hr />
