<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bonequest</div><div class="date">12-10-2003, 01:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They could get the evil guy from the movie Highlander to play an ogre warrior and Angelina Jolie to play Firona Vie (I think thats the name of that high elf girl on the box).  Billy Crystal would make a good gnome necromancer too--not sure why but he just naturally seems to go with that role.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Esvee</div><div class="date">12-10-2003, 01:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The opening scene should show an ominous Barb warrior in black Time gear beating the crap out of a platoon of Pallies and SK's. <br />
<br />
He would then explain to a gorgeous young girl rushing to bind his wounds after that they had been after his job.....:D <br />

If they do, id probably be a sucker enough to see it =/</div></div><hr />

<br />
IF they do take an undertaking that stupid, I hope they don't use the creative genunises (I spell like an ogre) who made the EQOA commercial.  I still have giggling fits when I think about &quot;Its time to kill the dragon!&quot;<br />
<br />
Wait a sec, maybe they should use those folks....</div></div><hr />

<br />
Go watch The Princess Bride.  Check the guy BC plays in that.  gnome works!<br />
<br />
If they did make an EQ movie, what the hey story line would they put in it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thaak</div><div class="date">12-10-2003, 08:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I reckon they'd use old story lines, like lightly touch on the Ring of Scale, mainly talk about the old world.<br />
<br />
Too much gets introduced in RoK/SoV, and Luclin was just homo in terms of lore.<br />
<br />
And PoP, don't get me started.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Toham</div><div class="date">12-12-2003, 11:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sean Connery would need to be in it. And when a pally gets on a mob everyone needs to shout NERF FIX WARRIORS. And the whole movie just needs to be one RoV thing. yeah</div></div><hr />

1 - to get an idea of what people thing about the Idea<br />
and<br />
2 - because I have writen a story line that I think (and my guild) thinks would make a good EQ Movie.</div></div><hr />
