<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Corllon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">With the gear I have now, which pieces of ornate should be my first purchases? Note that I have 50k, and I do have a stonewood bow for once I'm 61 -- I don't mind waiting to equip it, but even if once I'm 61 and can use it a piece of ornate would be a better buy, I'd be able to sell it off for around 85k on my server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Gloves</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kogur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Either gloves for the effect and a little stats, or save up a little more and get a BP ...but don't sell that stonewood.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>The Cromn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Legs are decent. 90 hps and clicky health(stamina).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kodoku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yes, get the gloves.  You'll get a little better stats, and the clicky haste will always be useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Hunky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I hardly ever use the haste from my gloves because in all my groups I have a slower/haster with better haste. I would recommend the Legs to both add raw Htp and Htp from the STA buff. just my opinon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Debbin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i rarely need the haste from glove either, but it makes a great junk buff for dispells</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If you are buying gear, don't waste your plats on ornate. For every piece other than BP, you can get a tradeable item that is as good or better in some cases. The bonus being that you get to sell the item when you upgrade it. Ornate sucks because it become no drop once you make it. The clicky from the gloves and BP are nice, but I don't think I would spend plats for either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Fitemore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The breastplate is the best you're likely to get. 63ac 115hp is amazing as is. There are only a handful better in the game. Most warriors will use it until Time. That is in addition to a clicky that is only replaced by shaman focus. The gloves are nice for the clicky, but it's situational.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Buuhmann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The BP and ornate will be useful for ever, until there is a better clicky focus line buff (not in the game right now) or a better clicky haste item (THO belt is pretty much the same and u prolly wont ever see THO.)<br />
Ornate gloves effect is: 30% spell haste for 72 mins. (the haste does stack with worn haste, does not stack with other spell haste but no other spell haste overwrites it, so if you have a haster aviable its still a crap buff.)<br />
ornate BP effect: 300hp 36ac 30sv magic for 90mins (focus line stacking)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Corllon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">UPDATE: My friend won a roll on ornate gauntlets and already had those, so I got the gloves for free. I still have the 50k and bow, ideas on what next? Save up for legs / BP? (I don't make very much cash, that could take a very long time, but might be worth it.)  Also, any non-ornate ideas for those of you who reccomended not spending pp on ornate?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kogur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If you have some buddies that are Plane of Earth flagged, I'd suggest getting them to farm you some elemental stones(granted this might take a while, but it'd be good exp for them) and get twoSteel Ring of Earthen Resilience (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=18255) . Those valorium rings are kinda ooky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kogur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Other than that,<br />
<br />
The only suggestions I have would be to get some levels and start running some pickup  raids on older velious targets. You could pick up a few pieces here and there from NToV, King Tormax, Lord Yelinak, Dain...but yer gunna need the levels before most people will follow your lead.<br />
<br />
P.S. GET RUN3!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Helm.<br />
<br />
You're a barbarian....it's self explanatory.  Unless you're planning on a helm of zek somewhere in the near future, snag a helm if you can, by far the best effect on ornate for Human/Barbs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I'm with Haass on this one.  Truesight/Plainsight/Faerune really makes the game more fun after being blind most of your life.  HoRZ would be better, but out of your price range it sounds like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Squizer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Go for the helm now.<br />
and perhaps try for vambraces then boots.<br />
<br />
In the meanwhile, just focus on level and once you ding 62 you'll be able to get your own ornate in BoT. just find some nbg group !<br />
Seeing your hp/ac at your lvl, you shouldn't be a wuss tanking in BoT...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Lochr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">If you are buying gear, don't waste your plats on ornate.

<br />
<br />
Could you elaborate on this please, Wandor? That doesn't seem like my impression at all. I just don't see items with the same hps and AC as ornate in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
I suppose Tae Ew plate greaves have the same hit points as ornate greaves, but I have seen those for sale exactly once. Not really an option.<br />
<br />
You can wear one Mana Threaded Bone Bracelet, for the cost of 2 Ornate Bracer molds (Sol Ro prices, ornate bracer's about 30K, MTBB's about 60K). Are you thinking of a 150K CAB for the other slot?<br />
<br />
I don't know of any droppable breastplate that's comparable, nor vambraces.<br />
<br />
Sure, the Helmet of Rallos Zek's sweet and all, but it's also 250K, if you can find it for sale. Ornate helms go for around 30K, is there anything in that ballpark, or even double?<br />
<br />
The only slots I'd agree with your statement is Boots, only because the prices for boots are so high, you might as well go with Boots of the Storm, and gloves, where Warlord's Gauntlets from hard LDoNs are common enough to be about the same price as ornate gloves.<br />
<br />
Really obnoxiously expensive items like CABs and Helmets of RZ are likely to hold their value (at least until it's known if the new expansion offers any droppable equivalents in any sort of supply), but that's a lot of cash for a warrior to have to raise. For the price of that helmet on Sol Ro, you could buy:<br />
<br />
ornate bracer x2<br />
ornate helmet<br />
ornate greaves or breastplate<br />
ornate vambraces<br />
<br />
Are there items I'm not aware of, that I could start looking for?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>FulorianC</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Theres some good stuff from LDoN hards that is on average 80 - 90 hp, that is superior in most ways to ornate. Buyable in bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Haass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Could you elaborate on this please, Wandor? That doesn't seem like my impression at all. I just don't see items with the same hps and AC as ornate in the bazaar. <br />
<br />
Wandor has a great plan, and what he says is true, in theory.<br />
<br />
The problem is that most servers aren't like Wandor's.  Finding a crystallized acid bracelet and a zek helm in the bazaar is like pulling teeth for a lot of servers.  Fuck, Wandor had 2 bracers and a Helm and was telling everyone to buy them before I ever even saw a helm for sale on CT.<br />
<br />
He's completely right, hypothetically.  In practice tho, Ornate will really be your best buy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Raaj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I wouldnt doubt you could get an RZ helm cheaper than an ornate helm if you know where to look.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">If I had to gear up a warrior today, this is what I would go for -<br />
<br />
Royal Attendant Breastplate of Sand<br />
With GoD augs and 3 slots to augment, this BP can be made in to 60ac 200hp, 69ac 160hp V4, or 69ac 170hp AoB. This should last you until you get Raex's. Having clicky mini-Focus is simply not worth the 150-200k or more that you would pay for the BP. If I looted an ornate I would sell it and buy a lot of other upgrades. You can buy a lot of Fo7 in PoK for the plats you save.<br />
<br />
Pitted Vambraces<br />
Not quite as easy to get since the nerf, but the Sludge-eating fly is still pretty easy to spawn.  You could easily farm these faster than you could farm the PP to buy ornate.<br />
<br />
Burnished Antique Greaves<br />
Again, not quite as easy to get since the nerf, but Chavoor is a 15min spawn with a PH. You'll get several repops in the time it takes to get your 100 kills doing the trial normally. If you are just in it for the loot, the exp is pretty good and there are several named you could kill if you have a tracker. These are a lot easier to get and you are only giving up clicky STA over ornate.<br />
<br />
Bloodied Boots of Dark Rites<br />
Better boots than ornate, usually cheaper in the bazaar too. I would just farm them myself before spending the plats. Drop in Mistmoore hard, one of the easier hard dungeons. If you have the plats to spend, these are tradeable and generally cheaper than ornate due to the effect ornate boots have for hybrids and clerics.<br />
<br />
Warlord's Steel Gauntlets<br />
Other than the clicky haste, these gloves are better than Ornate. You can farm them yourself from Ruj hard or buy them in the bazaar, most often cheaper than other gloves of similar quality. Unless you absolutely have to have the clicky haste, I would go for these gloves.<br />
<br />
Kizrak's Helmet of Battle for blind races or Malevolent Helmet of Suffering if you need the haste. Either helm is pretty good. If you can farm the rest of your armor and save your plats for a single item, I would save it for a Helm of Rallos Zek. By far the best single item you can buy in the bazaar, but the price usually reflects that.<br />
<br />
<br />
Bracers are really the hardest visible armor slot for warriors to equip well. Not only are good bracers hard to find, but you have to get 2 of them! Naturally, most bracers are also LORE so that just compounds the problem. There are a few options though.<br />
<br />
Mana-Threaded Bone Bracelet<br />
The 2nd best tradeable warrior bracer. Farm this yourself in Everfrost hards while you unlock the vendor for the A3 augs you will be buying anyway. Tradeable so can be purchased if you have rotten luck with the drops.<br />
<br />
Canescent Bone Bracer<br />
These are a random drop in Ferubi. Not a bad place to exp since the retune, one of these might be worth camping, particularly if your group is strong enough to take the mini named that drop augs.<br />
<br />
Miremuck Bracer<br />
Drops in the sewers, no real info on this bracer though.<br />
<br />
Malevolent Bracer of Suffering <br />
Everfrost LDoN merchant, with augs makes a very nice bracer. Considerably cheaper than the Tak bracer and is of equal quality as Ornate.<br />
<br />
Crystallized Acid Bracer<br />
Not only the best tradeable bracer, but not LORE. Get these if at all possible. The price tends to be prohibitive, but you can easily farm the Acid Mass with a single group. They are a rare drop, but these bracers will serve you well until you get Raex's.<br />
<br />
Cultural bracer<br />
For any race other than Vah Shir and Iksar, cultural is still an option for bracers. The price of the Ornate just doesn't justify 3ac 25hp V2. Cultural will work well enough until you can upgrade to any of the other bracers I have listed here. Ornate bracers are much better for clerics and hybrids.<br />
<br />
Really I am surprised that Ornate is all that cheap on other servers. I do a lot of buying and selling in the bazaar and most plate ornate is ridiculously priced on Terris Thule and Prexus. Typical prices -<br />
<br />
Plate BP mold - 200k+<br />
greaves mold - 80-100k<br />
bracer mold - 50-75k each<br />
helm mold - 50k<br />
boot mold - 75k<br />
gauntlet mold - 30-50k</div></div><hr />
