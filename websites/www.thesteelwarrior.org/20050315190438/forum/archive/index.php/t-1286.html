<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sturgis</div><div class="date">06-16-2003, 08:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's interesting. Got a charm and never did trials? Which flag did you get? Torment? Tactics?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wandor</div><div class="date">06-16-2003, 08:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A little more info would help. What level are you? How is your gear? What levels and classes do you have available to you?<br />
<br />
As a 65 wizard I have done the trials successfully literally over a 100 times. If you have the levels and the gear, it only takes 4 people to beat the executioner trial.<br />
<br />
tank - anyone with the HP/AC to tank the exe will do. 5500hp/1200ac should be good enough<br />
healer - any healer with a big mana pool will do. The smaller the mana pool, the more important it is the healer be a cleric.<br />
slower/crowd control - bard/shammy/chanter will all work. You either need stuff mezzed, stunned, or slowed. Personally I prefer enchanters since they can do all of the above.<br />
damage - this is the key to the executioner trial. The bigger the DPS, the easier it is to complete. Wizards and mages are good choices because they can AE early to get all of the mobs worn down fast.<br />
<br />
If you fill those 4 slots, the other 2 can be anything you want. The lower the levels and the lower level of gear the more you will have to compensate with the 2 open spots. Usually this means get more DPS to make stuff die faster.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&lt;------ getting my charm tonight (even though I'm unflagged) in preparation for getting some flag ... any flag ... I hope</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Friedrick</div><div class="date">06-17-2003, 09:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye, I recieved the charm although I am only flagged for PONB.  My charm has no stats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">06-18-2003, 10:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok i guess that was a little quick sorry folks ^^;;<br />
ill explain to keep everthing fair you can still get AA's and the charm if you complete the flags in the future, this is to keep the content from getting stale and un-used<br />
<br />
I have about 25 people levels 50 to 65 that are willing to help because their charms are also statless, i can cover all those slots<br />
<br />
what i want to know is how the justice trials work to get your flags, such as what to expect and when</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lens314</div><div class="date">06-19-2003, 11:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">4 or 3 waves of 4 mobs each<br />
<br />
Whenever you kill one mob, the executioner will warp back to his starting point.  <br />
<br />
If he(the executioner) gets from his starting point to the executionee, you will have lost the chance at the final boss mob.  <br />
<br />
The final mob will pop after the final wave<br />
<br />
Time details i can not remember, and my info could be wrong</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casai</div><div class="date">06-19-2003, 02:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">trials have been cover in many many threads do search. Execution trial is easiest and tell those below 60 they will not be getting their flags. Since you posting here I would say you would have hard enough time flaging 60+ folk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gerick</div><div class="date">06-20-2003, 03:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">not really, its just our over 60 crowd isnt that large, 3 alone cant do it ya know, rest is mostly 54 and up</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crystara</div><div class="date">06-21-2003, 01:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Exe Trial is 4 waves, the rock guys cannot be mezzed, others can.  Rocks also have significantly less hp so I suggest killing them first.  <br />
<br />
Best way to go about it is an AE group though, one tank, war prolly best for defensive tanking execution when he spawns, exe hits for 800 and procs a negative ~300ac debuff called armor break.  Rest of the group should be a chanter to chain stun the wave mobs, a cleric to heal, and two ae classes, mage and wizard.  Fill 6th spot with person going through for flag.  The higher the level each of these people are the better, they all need to be at least 60+ aside from the 6th filler spot however.  My 51 Wizards AEs all hit these mobs when I was the filler to PL him through, so sometimes you can rely on the 6th person just a bit to help with the DPS.</div></div><hr />
