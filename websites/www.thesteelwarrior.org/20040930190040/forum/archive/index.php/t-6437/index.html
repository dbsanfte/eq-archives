Would you view this as <br />
a) basically a tank item - great AC, good hp and other stats, of a quality found almost nowhere else (is there anything comparable bar the Time-RZ mask?)<br />
<br />
b) basically a cleric item - the biggest beneficial spell haste focus you can get, boosting the speed of every patch heal, and its rare too; only 3 items (pre-GoD) have it, and one of them is on Quarm<br />
<br />
c) open season, these are nice stats and anyone who can use it is entitled?<br />
<br />
Been doing Time for a few weeks and this just dropped for the first time, and feelings were surprisingly mixed on what I thought was a fairly straightforward situation.  Just looking for the viewpoint of some well-informed warriors :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Choppin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would let this go to clerics and go for RZ mask or Veil of the Inferno myself. Did, actually.<br />
<br />
But still, I'm gonna choose c)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gallerus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">c for sure</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Timmok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It is (obviously) a nice tank mask. However Quickening of Mithaniel is super important for a cleric to have(30% faster cast time on HL/SLs being the main bonus). So I would leave this item to the clerics/paladins.<br />
<br />
IMO MTs are better off waiting for Veil of Inferno from bertoxx. And if bertoxx is being stingy the mask from RZ is pretty similar stat wise to the faceguard.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">C, RZ mask has Singing Mod and Distance range so its contested too..<br />
<br />
Its really important for clerics to have spell haste, but also a lot of preist will have Fennin Belt</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">There's an earring with quickening of Mithaniel as well for that focus.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Niafix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">why would a tank want veil of the inferno?<br />
<br />
edit: we've had two of these so far, and both have gone to warriors. We use officer awarded loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Choppin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">why would a tank want veil of the inferno? <br />
<br />
for the 365 hitpoints maybe?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Injektilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I bought one, the first one we got actually before we knew the RZ mask or the Veil of the Inferno existed.  I dont regret it at all, however, i wouldnt mind picking up a veil still if for nothing else the free hp buff.  I think its an open game item though.  <br />
<br />
Nice thing about it is every class listed that can use it has other options too.  So it really wont be too much of an issue in most cases.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I think RZ ring is a better choice for the &quot;Form of&quot; of course the best is Quarm ring, and Veil of Inferno combo but thats 2 buff slots and not exactly easy to get</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Niafix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">or the 365 hitpoints maybe?<br />
<br />
I guess I was asking that because I would prefer RZ form over 180 hitpoints.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Everything in Time should be a FFA. Once you have been there a few months, so much stuff is going to be rotting it really doesn't matter. We have tier 5 loot going to twinks and a couple weeks ago a fresh recruit who hadn't been in the guild for 2 weeks got a Quarm loot. If you want it, take it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Which quarm loot?  Legs?  Timeweaver?  Can't really imagine the other stuff being FFA, even if you've been farming Quarm for a long time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Madronedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">i think he means that you shouldnt pref items to certain class's becaue eventaully it will all goe to recruits, might be mistaken tho</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Zotha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Well Quarm ring stacks with Veil click, im not sure about RZ ring but I doubt it. Problem being that even if youve been farming time for quite a long time its likely the all/all veil and quarm ring are still pretty contested.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sure, until you remember that at that stage clerics should have 23/25% spell haste already, so the increase in speed is nice, but not gamebreaking for fast casting patch heals.<br />

<br />
I see 5 items, none of them from Quarm:<br />
<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/itemswitheffect.html?id=3533<br />
Amulet of Crystal Dreams - PoTime Tallon<br />
Earring of Unseen Horrors - PoTime Cazic<br />
Faceguard of Frenzy - PoTime P3<br />
Gleaming Mesh Girdle - PoFire Fennin<br />
Temporal Chainmail Sleeves - PoTime Vallon<br />
<br />
and another 3 from GoD somewhere presumably:<br />
Aneuk Contemplation Skull  - GoD<br />
Choker of Centaur Slaying - GoD<br />
Illuminated Hammer - GoD<br />
<br />
Absolutely no reason to prioritise an item with a slight increase in a focus they already have, especially when the upgraded focus has 8 chances to drop per PoTime clear.<br />
<br />
A considerably greater case could be made for all PoTime plate BPs going directly to warriors before anyone else. Echo of Anger is unique and has the single greatest raid benefit of any other item in the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Avelariel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">You're right that it's 5 not 3 and not from Quarm, I was quoting a slightly incorrect cleric there.  However the Necklace and the Sleeves can't be worn by clerics, so it is only 3 from their point of view.  Majority of clerics i  my guild seem to have 18% bene spell haste.<br />
However, due to restrictions on the focus effect, it doesn't benefit Supernal Remedy, doesn't benefit CH, so basically it only helps on Supernal Light (/Holy Light).  For someone with 18% spell haste already, it speeds up Supernal Light by 0.4 secs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hammer goes to negative points people, stone goes to negative points people, leather bracer goes to negative points people, the legs are just flat out rotting now i think.  <br />
<br />
Couple of the other items are very close too heh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Niafix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I do believe that the Quarm click stacks with RZ click, but you have to click the Quarm ring first.  Something along those lines anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
52ac 195 hp <br />
<br />
<br />
and you are saying you would take the 2nd visor? what am i missing? not that the 2nd visor isnt good, but cmon...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Choppin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Eternal Ward and Form of Defense aren't supposed to stack, but they do. It's just a matter of time before they nerf it. (Yeah I know it's been in the game for a long time but things like that never go unnerfed.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Niafix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">and you are saying you would take the 2nd visor? what am i missing? not that the 2nd visor isnt good, but cmon...<br />
<br />
Because you can get a ring that adds +53ac. ok.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>1ludor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">i can only assume the 53ac and 180hp buff dont stack?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Phantron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">None of the Form of XXX stacks with each others. <br />
<br />
Quarm ring stacks with Form effects that don't have overlapping effects.  Apparently it's also stacking with Form of Defense which does overlap.<br />
<br />
We haven't had much luck on Stone of Flowing Times, and same with Leather Bracers.  The most common items we get seems to be Shroud of Eternity, Tailsman of Elements, or Quarm Shawl.  None of those will rot anytime soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Goradain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">God it would be nice to have to worry about this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Thalzaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I took the Faceguard the first time it dropped for us. couple reasons why.<br />
<br />
1) i was wearing a ToV mask (mask of sky) and was in dire need of an upgrade.<br />
<br />
2) I prefer to get the RZ ring for the ac buff, however i've passed on the first two since i had decent rings atm. Since only one form spell stacks, i would prefer the AC to the extra HP's<br />
<br />
3) We hadn't killed bertox/RZ at the time and didn't feel like waiting.<br />
<br />
I don't regret taking the mask one bit. It's got great ac and i'm thinking of removing the aug i currently have on it and adding an AC aug when i get one :)</div></div><hr />

I was in a hurry, so I didn't have time to edit my post. What I meant to write was, &quot;I'm pretty sure they do [stack].&quot; I remember reading a discussion on the subject, and that stacking them involved clicking Quarm ring first, then the other. Reading from Lucy I really can't tell. It looks like changes were made to EW and all the Forms on the 10th of Feb this year, but I can't decipher it... too tired.<br />
<br />
edit: prolly some info in this (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=5454) thread.</div></div><hr />

And a shaman from VS (i think) said his GF had both.<br />
Need to cast &amp; recast in a specific order (different timers too).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>brutall</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Originally posted by Swobu <br />
My GF has both Quarm ring and Bertie mask and they do stack if you put em on correct order: Ring first then mask. But since Eternal Ward only lasts 20 min and Form of Endurance lasts 36 min, she oftens only has Form of Endurance on - unless she is maintank. <br />
<br />
He was refering to the mask and quarm ring.  I'd be very very surprised if the rallos ring and quarm ring stack check out the differances in &quot;stacking on lucy.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Shakkha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">the question could be extended to the necklace of eternal visions.<br />
<br />
One of the two items with Preservation of Mithaniel, the best beneficial spell mana preservation available.<br />
<br />
It is a great cleric item, yet also a great tank item because of its 45ac and 190hp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">IMO trying to assign a class best suited by anything that drops in Time is useless. Look at it realistically - once you can beat time, you basically get 40ish pieces of loot for about 5 hours effort every 6 days. Who cares what class an item is better for, in about 3 months everyone is going to have Time loot coming out of their arses. Take what ever suits you, most stuff will be rotting soon enough.</div></div><hr />
