<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yuniargo</div><div class="date">12-09-2003, 03:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't like to take my eyes off my current target I'm tanking because I need to know if it is still aggro on me at all times, especially during the start of the fight.  I propose something like this as an optional indicator for openings:<br />
<br />
http://home.covad.net/~sunwoo/EQ/Pictures/Warrior/Opening_Graphical_Indication.jpg<br />
<br />
In game all the indicators would animate from near where the mob's name is to near the center of the mob.  The text will fade in and out as the animation plays and the text animation would play from the start of when you can execute the appropriate action for the opening until the end.  This text would appear &quot;on top&quot; of all objects including walls that may be partially blocking your view of the mob.<br />
<br />
I really don't want to have to pay attention to a separate window for opening information and would much rather keep my focus on the action.<br />
<br />
This would be a separate option that can be toggled on or off using a command similar to /showspells (maybe make it /showopenings on/off)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaesorn</div><div class="date">12-09-2003, 01:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">LDoN already has words popping up with &quot;Your adventure was a success!&quot;, so I think this at least feasible...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">12-09-2003, 02:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think this would be possible even for somebody with some XML talent to do without any help from SOE.  Maybe not the fancy fading or making it float over the mob, but the bars could sit in the middle of your screen and be invisible until an opening comes up I think.  Sars UI does this with the target window.  There is nothing there unless you actually have something targeted and then it pops up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ThornyEQ</div><div class="date">12-09-2003, 08:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If opening messages can be segregated out of a chat window, couldn't you do a ghetto form of this with an invisible window and judicious use of the hitsmode command?<br />
<br />
Can hitsmode be applied to just one window?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anker steadfast</div><div class="date">12-09-2003, 08:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hits mode will probably be a flashing icon of somesort if I can get away with it. Sorta like the animated class icon thing, but with 4 different types, like :<br />
<br />
A strongarm for offensive. (green background)<br />
A shield/breastplate for defensive. (blue background)<br />
Crossed sword for special (yellow / gold background)<br />
Homer Simpson for NPC fumbles - with accompanying &quot;DOH&quot; sound. (red background)<br />
<br />
And have it on top of the chatwindow, which would be just beneaththe MOB in normal day use.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stommper</div><div class="date">12-12-2003, 01:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looks like there aren't any openings at all, at least for the last 3 days! Brutul, have you even seen openings in the last few days? They took the &quot;opening timer&quot; off the Combat Ability window a couple days ago...what's up with that? Perhaps they are indeed going to make it a graphical signal? I'd sure like to help test the new abilities, but without any openings, it's kind of impossible, lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brutul</div><div class="date">12-12-2003, 05:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yea, openings are not working right now, dunno why.</div></div><hr />
