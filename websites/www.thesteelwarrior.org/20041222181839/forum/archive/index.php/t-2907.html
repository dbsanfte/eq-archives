<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Terail</div><div class="date">09-07-2003, 08:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Serverlious spawn time well i havent got him yet.. but he usualy spawns with in 1-24 hours after the servers go up after patch so pretty much he can spawn at anytime when server gose up. When killed i think its a 3 or 4 day spawn.. <br />
<br />
<br />
example: lets say he gets killed a 6:35pm your friend was there when it happend and has the time when he was dropped.. and it was on a wensday well you wait till oh say sunday at 6:35pm in EJ at the usual spot he should spawn at the time he got dropped give or take a hour or so..<br />
<br />
Hope that helps...<br />
<br />
EDIT*: this is what my friend told me to do.. he has dropped Servilious 6 times allrdy with this method and has gotten 4 scales for 3 of his war friends and 1 for himself allthough im too lazy to ask around guilds that have droped em to do this or to camp him /pulls out the old hard cash and heads to Bazaar* GOOD LUCK..<br />
<br />
<br />
PS: Got my Green Dragon Scales FINALY!! woot now to chardok and i'm done good luck for anyone who still looking to kill this Bitch.</div></div><hr />
