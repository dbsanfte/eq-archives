<br />
http://conquest.teamgbu.com/viewtopic.php?t=470<br />
<br />
Some very interesting concepts and ideas presented.  Wanted to know what people here thought.  <br />
<br />
We all know WoW is very different from EQ.  Most of us have probably carried over the HP &gt; All mentality we had before.  I know I did.  After reading this it makes me really start to think what is the &quot;all important, all encompassing&quot;  stat for WoW tanks?  If there is any.  As it stands I am HP equipped and tank fine in MC/Onyxia, but I, like everyone else, am looking for ways to become more efficient.  The things that really stood out to me are the people discussing + Defensive skill items.  If you could ask any priest in the game what they would want most for their tanks would it be more HP, more armor, or more consistant damage output from the mobs(E.G.  More defensive skill reduces crits and thereby keeps the melee damage at a consistant range.).<br />
<br />
Thoughts?  Comments?  Concerns?</div></div><hr />

<br />
More reason for me to believe that CH was one of the reasons I felt EQ was &quot;broken&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greysen</div><div class="date">04-08-2005, 03:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nope, there is no armor cap,  however there is a limit to the amount of armor you can get before you start having to destroying your stats to get it.  It's just a question of how much are you willing to compromise crit, hp and dps to get that extra % of armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lorre</div><div class="date">04-11-2005, 08:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There IS a mitigation cap:  http://www.worldofwar.net/guides/damagereduction.php<br />
<br />
This site calc can determine your mitigation based on your lvl and armor value.   There was also a thread on the warrior forums that the more defense skill you have, the less likely you get crit.  For those that have been to MC and above, crits are usually what kills you.  I think they determined that with around 400 (forgot number) skill in defense, they were only getting critted on the ENTIRE MC run 3/ THREE times.  For healers, having the tank close to immune to crits is huge.  It lets them heal better, they can judge your health loss easier, and just makes things a lot safer.<br />
<br />
So would you rather have crit immunity, or 10-25% more hitpoints?</div></div><hr />

<br />
You get about 1 and a half times as much defense as anticipation gives you from the average piece of gear for it.  I can't find however, much stuff that increases my armor by 10%.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greysen</div><div class="date">04-11-2005, 10:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry then :/  With a finite number of talent points to spend in general, it's hard not to make indirect comparisons to other talents.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GraniteMG</div><div class="date">04-11-2005, 10:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mitigation caps are harder to reach than they seem. Not only because of the insanely diminishing returns (making armor altogether less valuable at some point like Grey stated) but because most of the time you're going to be tanking a level 62 mob (most bosses are 62, even if they don't state it (bosses after you hit 60 that is)). Your mitigation drops down two tiers against mobs 2 levels higher, so the scale changes, and the cap becomes even harder to reach.<br />
<br />
It'll probably be a long while before anyone hits the cap, even if it's possible now its just not worth it. after you have ~60% mitigation, aiming for avoidance becomes absolutely hands down more efficient, as you'll avoid the diminishing returns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GraniteMG</div><div class="date">04-11-2005, 10:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">and on +defense value to stop crits... At 381 defense I haven't been crit (via parse in 3 upper brs runs, (YAY FOR KEYING)). So at some point it's just net even a factor any more. I generally look at +defense for its raw avoidance potential. The changes to defense make it more valuable against ranged attacks on test server, but who knows how thats going to be changed before it goes live.</div></div><hr />
