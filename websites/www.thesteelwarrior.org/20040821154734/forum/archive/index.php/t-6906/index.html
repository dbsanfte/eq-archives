<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Titor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know this is the warrior forum and lots of you dislike Pally's, but I posted to hopefully get some good advice from some of you who have played both classes, knowing that most of you are full of incredible amounts of info.<br />
<br />
Background:<br />
I have a 52 war and have played a paladin to the early 40's some time ago.  I greatly enjoyed playing the both of them, with both having strengths and weaknesses that we all know so well.  I have other 50+ characters as well. <br />
<br />
I play in a family-style guild including all levels from 10-65. We won't be going elemental, but do plan on playing around/farming in some of the planes.  Mostly for fun. We currently do not have a tank in guild that is 60+.<br />
<br />
Goal:<br />
I am going to level a tank, be it my current 52 war or re-roll a pally, to 65, and attempt to become one of the main or assisting main tanks in my guild.<br />
<br />
I have a lot of time to play. I don't mind grinding for levels/AA's. I also don't care how long it will take to get to where I need to be. I'm sure I'll enjoy the ride.<br />
<br />
I know that war's have more HP's and better defensive abilites. I understand that the pally stuns continue to give pally's better snap aggro.  I like the raw power of the war and the considerably higher dps of DW.  I like the healing ability and especially the aggro advantage of the pally.<br />
<br />
Question:<br />
Can some of the folks here that are experienced in playing both classes give any insight as to nowadays, knowing where pally and war stand as tanks, what they would do in my situation... knowing that I enjoy both classes but will only level up one.   :D <br />
<br />
I appreciate in advance any suggestions/comments you may have, and please note I'm not trying to start more 'flamage' between the two classes, this is simply a &quot;what would you do if you were me and why&quot; post.  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Payn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Warrior, unless you wanna cast spells.<br />
<br />
I bot a cleric so I don't have to play a hybrid ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>saniri</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you intend to MT/ST etc. Warrior. If just plan on using tank for groups, small raid targets, epic helps etc than make Pally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grendonbb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I know this is the warrior forum and lots of you dislike Pally's <br />
<br />
I don't think it's that we dislike pallies... it's that we dislike the way they treat<br />
<br />
a:  Warriors in general, talking about how much they suck compared to us.<br />
b:  Class Balancing, talking about how classes aren't balanced, and how they should be able to tank as well as us, while still casting spells.<br />
c:  Steelwarrior, coming here after they get kicked outta PoN for trolling, and bothering us.<br />
<br />
Least... thats what I dislike about pallies /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>apolyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">given a warrior/paladin of = gear/aas etc,  the warrior will always be the main tank.<br />
<br />
i gather that you want to be the point man.  if so ... play your warrior.  its a long hard road, but after you grind all the aa's you need, earn all the ldon points you need, and get rolling, warriors pretty much own knights (hence why they are upset).<br />
<br />
they will always mitigate the dmg better .. and they have more hps ... not to mention the disc's they carry.  that, and eq in the guild raiding atmosphere has revolved around warriors so long that you pretty much cant get rid of them anymore  :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Steenky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It really depends on the direction your guild is going in terms of a main tank.<br />
<br />
On one hand a paladin in decent gear/AA can work just fine as the focal in quite a few raid scenerios. On the other hand, sometimes that extra beef along with the versitality of the unlocked discs makes the undoable doable.<br />
<br />
From my experience most anything Luclin or lower can be tanked quite well by a paladin of moderate stats. It's once you try to progress in PoP that the gap begins to show, and getting a warrior to that power level will be the easier route.<br />
<br />
Ohh, my first toon is now a 52 paladin, and I also have a pre-testbuff level 40 on the test server. I also ask paladins for BSS all the time if that counts too. /chuckle</div></div><hr />
