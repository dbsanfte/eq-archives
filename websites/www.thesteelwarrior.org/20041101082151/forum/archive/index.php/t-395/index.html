<br />
We took zlandicar for the 3rd time and still no jaled dhar key  <br />
We have bargain enough key to begin some sleeper raid, but we cant do it without converting all of our talisman.<br />
Any info that might help us is welcomed  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>EgatBearskinner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Pretty sure the key you are looking for is a quest involving the rats and such, why not just have a rogue pick the lock to Jaled`Dar?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Waza Zaabi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">We will try pick lock. I know a quest to get key, but everywhere i read ppl said that u can kill Zlandicar to get it. Maybe it has been nerfed.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hussar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Pick lock is the easiest way.  There are supposably 2 ways to get a key though.  First requires killing the main rat of the rats that oppose zlandi, then turning in his head... this requires good zlandi faction.  Now, I'm also told he drops a key.  I've heard that his heart works as a key, but really I have no clue, as I've never actually used an item from him to open it, and never got a completely straight answer.  Just pick lock, it's easier =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>droog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You can also camp through the door on the left hand side, takes 2 or three tries, my memory is kinda fuzzy, just make sure have a way out ( gate potion, etc..).  Of course, the easy solution is have a rogue pick the lock.. heh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>SamirDaStinky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hand in Vaniki's heart + Zlandicar's heart to the Paebala head rat (his name escapes me atm)  for the key to jaled dar's chamber.<br />
<br />
the key is tradeable btw.<br />
<br />
But if you dont wanna do that, a rogue with max pick lock + a pick lock mod can open the door.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>wandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Your necros will freak if you waste a Zlandi heart on a key. Just pick it. Does take max skill + 5% lockpicks to do it though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Waza Zaabi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ok thx all for the information :)<br />
Sleeper here i come :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The hearts go to Neb in the paebala tunnels.  You also get that lovely 1hb that turns dragons into skeletons and annoys your entire guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Waza Zaabi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">We finally used picklock which worked good. 2 rogues 65 were here both maxed in picklocked, and they both confirmed u need a picklock modifier to be able to pick lock jaled dar door, hence max pick lock skill is not enough. They said me u need 210 in pick lock to be able to do it.<br />
ST rocks :)</div></div><hr />
